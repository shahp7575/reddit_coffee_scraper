• Jason Isbell

• Hatch

• Birds and Trees of North America (all three packs)

• Flora (as long as there are any Ruleds, I’m counting it)

• Reporter’s Notebooks

• Utility Ledger

• Black Ice

• Arts and Sciences

• Shelterwood

• America the Beautiful

• Traveling Salesman

1q4077e,https://i.redd.it/lmebornq3ebg1.jpeg,Just Got Back 🥰,"This is a long post lol buckle up. I was a first time traveller, and I’m sharing everything I would have wanted to know about Cancun. <3


  Day one: We arrive at Cancun airport for about 6 o clock. Our flight was delayed, so we missed our ADO to Plaza la Fiesta. We took another to Cancun city, and then took an uber to our hotel. Uber was about $40 with tip.  (ADO are about $30; I’m Canadian, so it’s slightly less in US dollars. You can purchase tickets ahead of time, just make sure you have a good time window. It’s only $30, but that was a little bit of a loss haha. )


  The room was a bit dated and dirty, but I really don’t care lol. It was still nice and spacious. Our vacation was $5-6k all in. (Foregoing all inclusive. Available for another G note at an optional.) I love my hotel. (We stayed at Emporio.) It wasn’t too busy, nor too quiet. We took a stroll down our stretch of Kukulcán, around 10pm. Got some Dominos pizza across the street. ($20 for a pepperoni; not terrible.) One of the convenience stores nabbed us, though. It was $15 for two drinks (Including an Arizona, 😏) and a small bag of queso Ruffles lol. It’s hit or miss on whether you’ll be gouged on something.


Day two: After some time in the Caribbean and at the swim up bar, We hopped on a city bus heading North. (Buses in the hotel zone only go up and down the strip until you pass the top of the “7.”) It’s 25 pesos for two people - this was my first learning curve. The smallest bills my bank gave me were 50s. A guy at a Pemex broke a bill for me. (That’s their gas station.) I have had to get help breaking bills several times, and sometimes it’s sketchy lol if you really need it / if you’re kinda stranded until you do.) They don’t seem to have enough 20s anywhere, and half the time a cashier has none. They’re holding onto their coins unless you buy something. Ask your bank for 20s.


  We hopped off the bus when we saw we were in the area that has all the things lol, using Fat Tuesdays as a GPS marker. We went to the famous taco place in the alley :p it was excellent. (I think it’s called Taco Factory?) Real Mexican flavours are deliciously subtle at times… We dump way too much salt into everything. My partner put the spicy sauce (green chili? Habanero?) on one of his tacos, it was really funny lmao he was okay, but it was HOT. 😂🌶️


  Avoid the flea market. Just don’t lol. The vendors are friendly, but with a suuuper aggressive undertone. Each one/three-four will be out front of their store, demanding that you go in, and they will literally grab you sometimes, (my male partner,) and they will all try to sell you drugs. I bought a couple souvenirs because I actually wanted them, and wanted to help the economy. Within an hour, I’d find out how overpriced the things were 😬 It’s okay lol. But for you, just skip it lol.


  For souvenirs, go to Plaza la Fiesta 😊 It’s actually a store, not a plaza lol. I got two nice tee shirts on clearance for $5 each, and a cute fridge magnet for like $10. 


  We went to take a bus back, but I didn’t even look at it tbh - it was an R5. It crossed the top of the 7 heading West, and then we realized we were in trouble when it then began heading North lol. We jumped out and, fortunately for us, the bus heading in the other direction was an R2. It didn’t just take us back to “the things;” it took us all the way back to our hotel lol. That was a long ride. Maybe 40 minutes? Yeah. Don’t fuck around lol if you’re not too wealthy.


  We never really made it to Cancun city or Walmart or whatever, but we had enough of a gander on the way in. I got groceries from a Chedraui supermarket at “the things” lol. I only found non perishables, but it was a real grocery store. Had an upstairs I think, so if they had fresh stuff, it was probably up there. I only really needed milk, and left it for later. 


Day three: What I didn’t mention about the Caribbean the day before was that sometimes, the waves will beat the shit out of you, and if you’re like us… This is actually a scream lol it’s a lot of fun. Just be prepared to take some tosses in the sand if the waves knock you down closer to the shore. It’s hard to get back up. I’ve already experienced this at home in Lake Erie many times and we’ve always enjoyed a good laugh about it. So on day three, the waves were gentle. 😊 Even if they were big, they weren’t cresting, so it would just gently roll over you. There was zero sargassum at any time. Temperature was nice. I did freeze in the pool bar after that, though. The smaller portion was packed, and it grossed me out lol I wasn’t doing that. The big pool was cold. 


  Definitely wear sunscreen, but the sun wasn’t the horror story that a lot of people tell. We aren’t really whitest of whites though, so take more caution if you are lol. My back did burn, I didn’t think to ask my partner to do it, but the rest of me never even got red at all. Burn wasn’t too painful / more itchy. Slight discomfort in later days. My partner has polymorphic light eruption; so I was really worried about it before… His skin is fine lol.


  We didn’t get sick, and perhaps the Culturelle probiotics played a hand in that. (Some people just do; I don’t think it’s necessarily a cultural thing.) We ordered room service for dinner. Fresh veggies on the sandwich and all. Fresh veggies on whatever throughout.


  Day three was NYE. The hotel wanted $300 each (CAD; or like 4000 pesos,) and hardly anyone bothered with that lol. We thought they all went to town, and we just went to overlook the beach. The beach ended up being the G spot, and there were fireworks. It was awesome. It was so awesome. I had been really sleepy earlier, so we only went down around 11. I got sloshed after midnight, and we had a blast chatting with some familiar friendlies. I don’t smoke, but I was in the smoking area with them. I had drank a bit too much, 😅 never got the spins or anything, but I was sick in the early morning. TMI: A good yak, some electrolytes and an Advil set me straight, and I was perfectly fine when I got back up a little later. I had bought cheap sangria in town the day before, I knew it would be gross just like big bottle coolers back home lol. 


Day four: We just enjoyed the beach and pool a lot this day. 😊 Towards dinner time, we caught a bus to Fish Frittanga. It was really good; reasonably priced. I forgot what we paid, but it wasn’t crazy. We had 2 carne asada tacos each. This is a bit of a small meal; I had snacks back at the hotel in order to keep meals cheap. Order 3 or more if you’re big ballin’. Real tortillas are small. 


  Day five: I’m writing this on my way back from the Chichen Itza tour. I’m speechless lol around how amazing that was. The drive in didn’t feel too long because I was writing this testimony. We also got a little education on the way in about Mayans and Mayan maths. First, we arrived at Choko Coffee in one of the villages in the jungle near Chichen Itza. (My gift receipt has two village names; IDK where it actually was lol we were just told Chokocoffee.) 


  They gave us a shaman, a show and an incredible buffet. Each day, the government chooses a different village for the tourists to stop in. I picked up an obsidian pendant for a little under 300 pesos. I went to get it blessed, but the shaman needs some coin lol so he purified us on the house instead. Before the show, the dancers got me for 300 pesos tip after inviting us to take pics, but I’d never dare mind… This is the part of the economy I want to help as much as I can. Cancun is doing just fine lol. Yucatán. <3 When we sat down at the table, they offered a drink, I said “it’s not extra, is it?” It was lol so I politely declined. 200 pesos. (I only brought $300 Canadian lol so I had to watch it. :p) 


  After that, we arrived in Chichen Itza. The history is just absolutely incredible. (As is the temple, of course.) We had *amazing* tour guides, from our own Lalo, to Ruth, who had the English tourists inside Chichen Itza. (She is of Mayan descent, as well.) They had excellent energy. I didn’t see another tour group having as much fun lol. We met an older couple from Vancouver who were our buddies for the day 😊 We had a blast with them, too during the free time in Chichen Itza. Wandered down to the cenote where the bodies of the sacrifices were thrown. I liked the later history - not the sacrificial enemies/slaves, but the honor, and the games lol. Don’t get me wrong - I love FAFO; but I am so Goddamned far away from hatred right now, and I will be doing my damndest to never be pulled back down into it again. 🥰 


  THE IK KIL CENOTE OMG <3 I did the big jump, too 😋 You cannot go to Quintana Roo without jumping over to the Yucatan to see Chichen Itza and the cenote. You might have to actually take the tour… I don’t recommend renting a car. I know the ADO goes to Chichen Itza, but you cannot miss the cenote. It’s breath taking. It’s fucking refreshing lol. I wish it weren’t sketchy to rent a car because I’d love to have a longer time there. 😋 We were quick; it’s a big day. 


  Valladolid was also quick, but really cool. It’s the real Mex. Cancun just isn’t lol you go there to see the Caribbean. On the other side of the hotels and in town, you’re looking at another Florida, just better lol despite some run down infrastructure. Which brings me to something else I learned. 


  I have a new appreciation for psycho A type liberals. 😂 Me, although I’ve become a little more put together over the years, I’m laid back, and I’m very much “that’s a you problem.” If you’re walking around crumbling infrastructure where you can trip and fall and gouge your eyes out, that’s a you problem lol. But if it weren’t for a good ratio of those who strive for greatness and recognition, that’s exactly what we would be doing. So, if you’re a go getter, if you like things neat, if you have stupid-high standards. I appreciate you. 😊


  By the same token, there were many miserable Banana Republic assholes, but I think that’s divine intervention. You can take it too far. No amount of money or accomplishment will make you happy. So the meaning of life, I think it lies somewhere between the boy and the man lol. To some, take it easy. To others - get your shit together.


I love you all lol. 


Day six: We checked out of our hotel and went to Museo Maya next door. They held our bags, accepted Visa, and it was only a few bucks to get in. Do NOT get scammed by Viator. They will charge you $40 each. They claim it’s to skip the line. There isn’t one lol. 


  I was totally engrossed with everything in the museum after falling in love with Mayan culture the day before lol. They have a small temple on the outdoor portion of the grounds along with other ruins that predate the Spanish Inquisition. (I’d love to answer any questions or share if I caught something you’re interested in, photo or info wise.)


  After that, we got on an R2 heading South and rode it until it turns around at the end. We started walking on for a bit in hopes of running into some food soon. That didn’t happen. 😂 I freaked out because I thought something bit me, but it was just a tiny Mexican burdock type weed that grazed my ankle from my shoelace. It was really sharp. 😂 No blood or anything, just spooked me. :p When we were done with the stroll, we found a good spot to call an Uber to the airport.


  We ate at Guacamole Grill. It was really, really good. High quality and just so damn tasty. We had the Mexican burger… Oaxaca cheese, avocado, chorizo… etc. About $60 CAD.


…We then sat on the floor for like 6 hours, because our flight was delayed twice, then cancelled as we were about to board. (My partner’s a smoker lol. 🤦🏻‍♀️ They have seating beyond security.) They sent us to a cheap but not terrible hotel for the night, in the city. (My cousin once got Emporio for a delay, I’m envious. 😆) There were hundreds of us because of the Venezuela thing…


  So now this is day seven. I hate Porter right now, because your only options were to print or email boarding passes, and email wasn’t working. We were checked in, but we had to line up for hard copy boarding passes. (There was also Apple wallet, but my partner has a Samsung, 🤦🏻‍♀️ and we put the roaming on his phone lol.) I’m currently documenting my trip in real time. We are just about to take off.


Day seven still and in the air 👍🏼


Quarter to 3: I’m about to land. I sank two red wine really fast, and got a buzz on. Turns out I get really emotional about travel and flying, so I’m not crying, you’re crying lmao. This was really special to me 😊🥰 Whereas I wish I were the kind of person who could do this all along… I wouldn’t trade being me. 

  
  (In my early 20s, I saw another girls’ honesty about how travel isn’t sunshine and rainbows the entire time, and I was poor and needed the little things to tolerate life, so I didn’t think I’d be interested in working towards it. Now I love life <3 and I can let go of little things and trade them for travel.) 


  I usually have social anxiety and kinda hate people. (Hate is a strong word, think weaker.) Not in the moment, but in my general worldview. With travel, it’s spiritual. You make so many friends along the way who you’ll never forget. 🥹 It isn’t scary or taxing to chat with people.




What made me feel smart: 


* Submersible phone pouch, but keep an eye on it. It might fail a bit after a while. I was holding my phone up in the water the last few times, but it was still useful for taking my phone into the water.


* Travel bug spray  


* Brought dish soap 


* Ladies - a hair smoothing product for the scarecrow look lol sun and salt will do that. (I’m crazy low maintenance; so don’t get it twisted lol.) 


What I’d do different next time: 


* No string bikini. A rough Caribbean *will* salute Harambe, many times lol. You don’t want to salute the other guests. 😭🤣


* More money. I did this off the cuff, so if I had more time to plan, I’d have more money.


* No Cancun! The couple we met went further South, and paid half of what we paid. ($2600 Canadian for five days, half price, so that’s a quarter price.) I know I chose literally the most expensive time of the year lol. NYE was double, to boot. I know my way around now, so I don’t need to be so close to the airport or the tourists. 


* No water shoes. You don’t even need them, you’ll just skin your toes a little lol the sand gets in.


* I lost two pairs of sunglasses in the Caribbean 😅 Mine were prescription. A pair of Michael Kors washed up on shore, and they fit perfectly over my regular glasses. ;) Don’t wear them in the water hahaha.


* I still want to do Xcaret and Isla Mujeres. There is also a good sea turtle area on the Quintana Roo coast. 


I think that’s it! Any questions?

1q406j4,https://www.reddit.com/r/productplace/comments/1q406j4/whats_the_difference_between_camping_cookware_set/,What's the difference between camping cookware set types?,"When you're planning your next outdoor adventure, choosing the right camping cookware set can make or break your meal experience. Different materials and designs offer unique benefits depending on your camping style and needs.

**Aluminum Camping Cookware Sets**

Aluminum sets are popular because they're lightweight and heat up quickly. You'll appreciate how fast you can boil water or cook simple meals. However, aluminum can get hot spots and sometimes gives food a metallic taste. These sets work great for short trips where weight matters most.

**Stainless Steel Options**

Stainless steel camping cookware is tougher and lasts longer than aluminum. It won't dent as easily when you're packing and unpacking your gear. The downside? It's heavier and takes longer to heat up. If you're car camping or don't mind the extra weight, stainless steel gives you durability.

**Titanium Sets**

Titanium offers the best of both worlds - it's super light like aluminum but strong like steel. The main drawback is cost. Titanium camping cookware sets can be expensive, but they're perfect for backpacking where every ounce counts.

**Cast Iron for Base Camping**

Cast iron skillets and Dutch ovens are heavy but amazing for cooking over campfires. They distribute heat evenly and can handle high temperatures. You'll want these for car camping or RV trips where weight isn't an issue.

**Non-Stick Coated Sets**

Non-stick camping cookware makes cleanup easier, especially when you're dealing with limited water. Just remember that the coating can scratch easily, so you'll need to be gentle with your utensils.

**Hard-Anodized Aluminum**

This type combines aluminum's light weight with better durability. Hard-anodized surfaces resist scratching and don't react with acidic foods like regular aluminum might.

When choosing outdoor cooking gear, think about your camping style. Backpackers need lightweight options, while car campers can choose heavier, more durable pieces. Consider how many people you're cooking for and what types of meals you plan to make.

The best camping cookware set balances weight, durability, and cooking performance for your specific needs. Whether you're boiling water for coffee or preparing a full meal, having the right pots and pans makes outdoor cooking enjoyable instead of frustrating.

Recently I wanted to get a better cup and decided to buy a v60 because thats what everyone says is great! The issue is that all the ratios people use are WAY more than what I was using for my single cup. My grinder was set to 8 for the keurig and everyone says to use 5 and some change, so I put mine at about a 6 figuring that would work. Also after measuring the weights of coffee people say to do about 25g for like 350ml of water and my mug is basically 500ml.

Well my keurig filter was only holding a little over 8g of coffee for my 500ml mug. Now every cup of coffee I have tried making with the v60 is so overpowering I can barely drink it.. Was just wondering if you guys had any recipes or solutions that might help my issue here?

1q403m8,https://www.reddit.com/r/ProductNew/comments/1q403m8/how_do_smart_plugs_differ_from_smart_sockets/,How do smart plugs differ from smart sockets?,"You might be wondering what the difference is between smart plugs and smart sockets. Both help make your home more connected, but they work in different ways.

Smart plugs are devices you plug into your existing wall outlets. Once connected, they turn any regular appliance into a smart device. You can control lamps, coffee makers, or fans through your phone app. These wireless plugs are easy to install - just plug them in and connect to your WiFi.

Smart sockets, on the other hand, replace your actual wall outlets. They require electrical work since you're swapping out the entire outlet fixture. This means you'll likely need an electrician to install them safely.

The main differences come down to installation and cost. Smart plugs offer the easiest setup. You don't need any tools or electrical knowledge. Smart sockets give you a cleaner look since there's no extra device sticking out from your wall, but they cost more when you factor in installation.

Both options let you schedule devices, control them remotely, and monitor energy usage. You can turn lights on before coming home or shut off appliances you forgot about.

For most people, smart plugs make more sense. They're cheaper, portable, and you can move them between outlets as needed. You can start with one room and expand your home automation setup gradually.

Smart electrical outlets work great if you're renovating or building new. But if you want to test smart home features without major changes, connected plugs are the way to go.

When shopping for these devices, look for ones compatible with your phone and voice assistants. Many work with Alexa or Google Assistant for hands-free control.

I’m thinking double-walled, but with a smooth/curved ceramic lip with a little thickness. No metal or pointy-ness allowed. Preferably with a standard “D” handle.

#1: Cherry picking

When you say you believe in whatever religion, you cannot cherry pick what suits you. Either you believe it or you don't. I see a lot of people defending the Bible when people bring up ~certain extreme scriptures~ because ""tHaT's ThE oLd TeStAmEnT aNd We OnLy aBiDe By ThE nEw TeStAmEnT!!1!"" No. You don't get to cherry pick Bible verses because it's no longer pc and makes you look bad. Them saying that they don't follow half the book they worship - or that they don't agree with particular excerpts - is purely ridiculous. **You do not get to cherry pick.**

#2: Perpetuating and justifying bigotry and control

At its core, religion is about control. It also fosters and encourages bigotry. While I'm sure you all will agree, _many_ people use religion as an excuse to be an awful person because it's generally more acceptable that way. Like, if you can justify your bigotry by saying, “oh, it's just what [insert whatever religious book you're into here] says,” you're less likely to receive flak because it's generally frowned upon to point out bigotry if it's part of a religion. 

For example, Christians - particularly Catholics - and their inability to use a search engine about that one line “condemning” gay people. It's going to seem like I'm going off topic, but I'll loop back. Just stick with me.

I grew up with divorced parents. My mom had sole custody, and is Catholic. My dad is Methodist. Since I primarily lived with my mom, she made the majority of the decisions about my life and upbringing, so I was forced to go to mass every Sunday and PSR on Thursdays (a short religious class at the church during the evening for those who don't know…stands for Parish School of Religion). Eventually, she enrolled me into Catholic school when I was nine despite my protests. 

I never did believe in God. Not even as a kid, and never once during church or really ever. I remember being five or six and reading this children's Bible from the Methodist church I went to with my dad, and asking him about Adam and Eve. It didn't make sense to me, and I had questions my dad couldn't answer. He encouraged me to question religion despite his faith, and I just never stopped. 

Anyway, Catholic school wasn't _that_ bad except for the uniforms and the cliques and the religion classes and the mass on Fridays and the fundraisers and th- okay, yeah it was kinda bad. At least the food was good and I had friends, I guess. Here is my point; one of my friends and a classmate were gay. My gaydar is never wrong, and they were most definitely gay. 

I remember asking my friend about it when we were ten or so, and he got _so_ defensive and angry even at his age that it shocked me. I didn't understand why it was such a terrible thing to be gay because no one had ever taught me that it was. Another time, I made some comment about that aforementioned classmate being gay to him in front of his mom (we were on a field trip), and she reacted even worse than my friend had. I don't remember exactly what it was that I said, but I know it was just some off-hand comment that wasn’t meant to be rude. Regardless, her reaction that day taught me that being gay is something the church wants you to suppress. (And yes, they are actually both gay. I looked them up on social media awhile ago and they both seem to have come to terms with it now.)

Another instance was when my (step)mom’s “adoptive” mom (stepmom’s mom’s best friend) married her best friend (not my stepgrandma; a different woman). Sorry if that's confusing. Anyway, they wanted to be married by our pastor from the Methodist church we went to, but it wasn't allowed by the church for our pastor to marry them. Our pastor even attended this huge Methodist conference within the church to fight for the right to officiate LGBTQ+ marriages, but it wasn't allowed. I just looked it up and it's allowed as of 2024, but this wedding happened in 2016 or so. I remember how much of a letdown it was for all of us when our pastor wasn't allowed to officiate. 

The Catholic church still condemns gay people and gay marriage for all that I'm aware of. Why? Bigotry.

#3: Religion is baseless

Why do they believe what they believe? That's the big question that we all have, right? Why _do_ they follow books from centuries or millennia ago? Here are my guesses:

They need something to justify their existence. People need a reason to live; without something to believe in, many people feel lost in life as if they don't have a purpose. Believing in something that explains their existence eliminates that existential dread. 

Similar to the reason above, being a part of something that they feel is bigger than themselves gives them a purpose. People are social animals. Most of us like to mingle. Church provides that community and fills that void for many people, creating opportunities for you to meet new people.

It's “tradition.” They were indoctrinated when they were young by parents who were indoctrinated, and are surrounded by people who were - you guessed it! - _also_ indoctrinated. **People are products of their environment.** It's much harder to break free of something if it's at the core of everything you do in life or is a part of your everyday life.

They feel guilty over something they have done and believe that religion will absolve them of that guilt. This goes for people who have done something wrong and convert to a religion or become much more religious as a result. 
They need something to justify their bigotry, as explained in my second point.
They are moralless people without religion and following a religion gives them the basic humanity we all should already have. This is obvious if you tell people you're an atheist, because they'll often jump to conclusions that you have no morals since you don't believe in something - which is ridiculous. **If you need the threat of hell or a god to be a good person, you're not a good person.**

When I was in confirmation classes, I used to like to ask the priest - or whoever else was in charge of us that night - questions that would put them on the spot. I figured since I had to be there, I might as well have fun by provoking them a bit. (Cut me some slack; I was 14). Anyway, I asked the priest one night why anyone follows the Bible when it could just be the workings of some schizophrenic person. Centuries just tainted with pure delusion over the writings and edits of someone mentally ill. One book could’ve had a domino effect that caused the authors of the others to spiral into delusion, you know. The priest did not like that lmao.

Okay, now I'm going to loop back to the bigotry.

#4: Most all religions are inherently misogynistic. 

From a feminist standpoint, I believe this is because Abrahamic religions are created by men who cannot cope with the fact that it's women who create life. Sure, they may supply the sperm necessary for fertilizing the egg that forms the fetus, but it's women that do the heavy-lifting. We grow it, give birth to it, and primarily carry the burden of raising it. So why are women treated so unfairly by religion?

The Bible teaches that Eve “ate the forbidden apple from the tree of knowledge in the garden of Eden” because Lucifer manipulated her into doing so, then Adam followed suit. As such, women are said to be biologically made to suffer from painful childbirths for all eternity as punishment for eating from the tree of knowledge despite Jesus supposedly dying for _all_ our sins...yet it's men who curiously have the Adam's apple in their throat. Make it make sense.

The Bible also teaches that Eve was made from Adam’s rib, yet in the likeness of god. So that would make god genderless or at least genderfluid. If we are all supposedly created in the likeness of god and created equal, why are we not treated equally?

In the Old Testament, [virgin women who are raped are supposed to marry their rapist, who in turn is supposed to pay her father after raping her](https://www.biblica.com/bible/?osis=niv%3Adeu.22.28-deu.22.29). While I cannot find a verse enabling it, I know that Muslims will also do “honor killings” of rape _victims_ - which is just murder - because they believe it absolves the woman of her shame. 

Women are also made to cover themselves up out of “modesty,” yet the same extreme coverings do not apply to men. While I'm sure many women actually _want_ to wear coverings like burqas, you cannot deny how utterly misogynistic it is. If you want one sex to cover themselves out of “modesty” yet not the other, it's sexist. I have a problem with modesty in general because it's all such bullshit. We all have skin. We all have the same body parts. Why must we cover it up? Why did Adam and Eve even feel shame about their naked bodies when that's how god made them? I'm not advocating that we all go nude, but that _being_ nude is not inherently wrong. As Jesus said, [“if your eye causes you to sin, pluck it out and cast it from you”](https://biblehub.com/matthew/18-9.htm). Teach men not to rape and molest and modesty will be irrelevant. (And I'd say people to be more inclusive, but it's mostly men. [Statistics don't lie.](https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov/LATEST/webapp/#/pages/explorer/crime/crime-trend))

In the Catholic church, women also aren't allowed to hold positions of power. Women cannot be priests nor can we be popes. When I was a kid, I remember my mom telling me that there used to be a test that popes had to do in which they'd sit on a toilet-type chair and someone would feel them up to make sure they had a penis. While this is apparently just a legend, it upholds the fear of a woman becoming a pope. I actually got banned from a particular sub for asking why women can't be popes. 

Like how I mentioned above, I liked to ask provoking questions when I was in confirmation class. Once, I asked the priest why women can't be priests, and he had no answer for me. He was actually appalled. My stepdad told me it's because Catholicism is patriarchal, and since priests are supposed to embody/project Christ during mass, a woman cannot ever do that for obvious reasons. (It’s not my intention to be transphobic with that statement, so don't come for me.)

So if there are women saints and if Mary - specifically Jesus’ mother - is worshipped in the church, why are women not also highly respected? Supposedly, Mary Magdalene was either Jesus’ girlfriend or only woman disciple, and I read somewhere that there's supposedly a missing book that she wrote that was never added to the Bible. So why are women treated so unfairly when it is we who create life and we who are supposed to be protected and valued? 

Another example is the concept of virginity, which seems to only be relevant when it comes to women. There are “virginity tests” that girls and young women are subjected to, and gross virginity contracts that the church makes you sign. There’s also the purity ring that fathers sometimes give to their daughters, and in wearing, pledge to their fathers to remain “pure” until marriage. Accompanied with those are also sometimes purity balls, which is basically the same thing but in the form of a weird, formal father-daughter dance.

When I was in that confirmation class, some woman from the bishop’s office or something came to have us all sign abstinence contracts. I was the only one who didn’t sign that shit because I was disgusted by it. I was literally 14. Mind you, one of the girls who was in the class became a mom out of wedlock at 17 and one of the boys ended up raping a classmate. Abstinence contract, my ass. 

On a side note, I would like to include the fact that I was kicked out of my confirmation the day of during the dinner we had beforehand. The same woman from before came with papers for us to fill out about why we wanted to be confirmed, and I took the liberty of telling the truth; I was only there because my mom wanted me to be, as was everyone else…I did not believe in god. I was swiftly pulled out and told to leave the church. Afterwards, my mom was berated and harassed with calls so badly from the other kids’ mothers that she hasn’t been to church since. It’s been nine years. 

#5: Religionists misconstrue their texts to restrict reproductive rights

This much is extremely obvious and still relevant today. I don't need to go into this, I don't think, but I will say this; your religion does not give you the right to deny other people freedoms. If you don’t agree with it, then good thing no one’s making you do it. You cannot make decisions about life for other people when _science_ says otherwise and your opinions (which is all they are) are rooted in religion. Religions are not applicable nor relevant to healthcare. 

#6: Many religions are racist by proxy or perpetuate hate against other religions

Personally, I cannot think of an example from the Bible or any other text being explicitly racist, but that’s besides the point. Somewhere along the way, religionists started using their texts to excuse or perpetuate racism. Bigotry runs deep…people hate what they don’t understand. Why some people believe others are inferior for their natural, physical characteristics beyond anyone’s control is beyond me. 

Slavery was justified by tradition, lack of empathy, bigotry, racism, and religion. The church still sends its followers on missions to “third world” countries to try to convert the people living there into whatever faith they’re a part of. Sure, they do also actually help the people, but it should not be socially acceptable for random ass people to take trips to foreign countries to try to force their religion onto other people. No one needs or wants that.

Hitler used religion to justify his antisemitism. 

England used religion to justify their colonialism.

The Catholic church would probably still kill “heretics” if they were allowed to.

The United States exists because the colonizers that came here wanted to escape religious persecution (while still persecuting others themselves, ironically).

Etc…

#7: Many religions are purely ridiculous and nonsensical 

I've been watching videos on Mormonism out of curiosity, and I had no idea until now just how ridiculous it is. Alyssa Grenfell, an ex Mormon, makes very interesting YouTube videos for any of those who are interested. 

Anyway, they have to wear special underwear that they believe protects them, they can't drink coffee, tea, or alcohol, and - get this - they believe they'll become sort of god in the afterlife and the men will have numerous wives or something like that. It's pure nonsense. Alyssa says that Joseph Smith's book on the rules of Mormonism is so vague that many people have to turn to the internet for interpretations. Does that seem logical to you?

And don’t even get me started on evangelicals _or_ Pentecostals…mass hysteria in the form of speaking tongues. Then pagans, spiritualists, and Wiccans think that mixing some herbs and saying a few lines does anything. I used to sorta “practice” Wicca when I was in my counter-culture phase. I still didn’t necessarily believe anything, but there was an unexplainable instance involving something I did while I was practicing. I stopped trying to convince myself that herbs and candles do anything after a few years of sporadic spellwork. I think chakras and zodiac signs are a load of bullshit, too. It’s all bullshit, even if it’s not necessarily harmful.

Spelling of harmful, there's also the extremely awful, weird, and disgusting practice of circumcision that stems from Judaism. Female circumcision is also done to girls in Islamic religions. Both kinds are mutilation, and should be banned by law. I don’t care if it’s “religious freedom.” You should not be able to cut off a part of someone’s body - or deny them healthcare (looking at you, antivaxxers and Big Hospital deniers) - under the guise of the First Amendment or just because they’re your kids. I see so many news articles lately of children dying because their parents wouldn’t get them proper healthcare. There’s also the overlap of parents not giving their kids a proper education (in general, or in things specifically such as sex ed) for religious reasons. That’s inherently harmful.

Religious texts and beliefs in general are purely ridiculous. Ever heard of the god of the gaps fallacy? For those who haven’t, it’s basically that religionists attribute any and all unexplainable events or things to god up until they can be explained by science. If your god is the creator and master of all, the god’s supposed existence becomes negated once something once attributed to them is explained by science or logic. One time, though, I did have a religionist say in response to this that things such as the weather can be explained by science _and_ god because god put the systems in place. Like no, you cannot have it both ways. It’s all or nothing. You cannot cherry pick. 

#8: Religionists are objectively just as weak-minded as they are uneducated

If you need a god to convince yourself that life is worth living or that your actions have consequences, you are a weak person. If you genuinely believe something is out there and cares about us _at all_ when there are so many atrocities that happen each and every single day, you are a weak person. If you cannot accept the existence of other people (other races, ethnicities, sexual orientations, etc) and use religion to defend that, you are a weak person.

There are three simple categories people who believe in god fall into, and I've yet to meet a religious person who doesn't.

1) They feel guilty about something.

2) They can't cope with the fact that the only reason they're here is because their parents fucked.

3) They were born and raised into religion and never snapped out of it.

I know this sounds extreme, but you cannot convince me otherwise. If there was a god, why don’t they care about us? Why wouldn’t they want us to know of their existence for certain? Why would they leave us guessing? Why would they abandon us if we’re their children - who they supposedly love and watch over?

Even those who say they follow the teachings of the Bible still do awful things in the name of god. Denying people’s right to live, freedom of choice, freedom to practice their own choice of religion. Murdering, raping, torturing. Indoctrinating, manipulating, lying, stealing, harming, etc. It goes on and on. So much harm and so much hate all done in the name of religion to theoretically appease some god that clearly doesn’t even care about them.

There is also a connection between Republicans, religion, poverty, and lack of education. That much is obvious, and I don’t want to go into it because I’d make this post even longer than it already is. Basically, they lack critical thinking and the drive to both do and be better. 

I can think religion is stupid all I want, but the difference between me and those who practice it is that I am not going to hurt people for no fucking reason other than a book. I can live and let live unprovoked. They cannot. If they don’t agree with some sort of political issue because of their inability to mind their business, they make it everyone else’s problem. Being of a certain faith does not give you the right to make laws preventing other people from living their lives as they see fit. It also does not give you the right to attack people who do not do what you think they should. Further, it does not give you the right to force your beliefs onto other people. The 10 Commandments should not be taught or posted in schools. Dareisay, children should not be exposed to religion at all. People should be free to make their own religious choices for _themselves_ and _themselves only_ once they are an adult.

#Conclusion and rhetorical questions

Religion is used to control people, and is often backed by nonsensical reasons. While some morals taught by the church are good, those same morals can be taught without religion. 

Why are people so desperate to justify the existence of a god? Why do people need to know why we’re here and what we’re here for, if any reason at all? I don’t concern myself with hypotheticals. I do not care about things that don’t matter, and honestly, I don’t think any of us have a purpose. That scares religionists because they feel like they need a definite, extraordinary reason to be alive when there isn’t one. Here’s a tip for any strays: life is what you make of it. Learn to accept yourself. Better yourself and your life. Don’t waste your time praying to air when you could be using that time to work towards what you’re praying for. Go to therapy if you can’t, just don’t make it everyone else’s problem.

1q4033s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q4033s,In need of some advice - leaves going yellow,"Greetings.

I may require some advice from experienced users.

I am a complete beginner to chilli pepper growing but as a beginner, I make mistakes, and despite all of the mistakes Ive made, I did manage to get some peppers to grow enough to start fruiting (the cultivar on photo is a local version of Capsicum Annum called Damián).

However, two days ago (and about a week after potting into larger pots), the leaves on the plants started going yellow at random. I originally thought that could be Nitrogen deficiency, but I have been using liquid fertilizer named Chilli Focus (a tea spoon of it per liter of water).

Soil used is black compost mixed with perlite, vermiculite and used ground coffee beans for editional source of nutrients/elements in 10:1:1:1 ratio with a spoon of mycorhizal funghi for root protection and aditional symbiosis.

I bottom feed water every time I see the leaves starting to doop to avoid overwatering, but even with that I did notice sign of edema on some of the older leaves, and adjusted watering accordingly.

Lighting is a full spectrum LED panel VIPARA Spectra XS series, long version, with 18:6 light/dark ratio at 75 percent intensity (I have no measuring gadget to know the detailed figures), and the room temperature is kept at stable 25 C (77 F).

Before writing this post, I did google extensively to figure out the cause of leaves going yellow myself, alas my efforts were fruitless as google offered up to 6 different causes of leaves yellowing.

Please, any idea and advice to fix this and prevent loss of fruits that have grown already?

Thanks

I'm 28M, and I haven't dated in a long while. Now that I'm in a good headspace, I really want to get back into dating. 

I met this wonderful girl a couple months ago in a different city, and we kept in touch sporadically over text after that too. This weekend I'm going to said city for something else and I'm meeting her at a party!

I've been overthinking like crazy about how I'd ask her out, or what I'd do if she rejects me, I don't even know if she's single, etc etc. Do I ask her out to coffee? 

I'm not a fan of asking someone out via text, but I know I'm gonna overthink when the time comes to ask someone out in person :(

Can my fellow Redditors please offer me any and all advice? Guys, how do I man up and muster the courage to ask her? Girls, how do I do it in a non-creepy way? Should I hint that I'm interested in her via text first? 

I will provide updates on this thread :)

On Raj Hamsafar Express from Udaipur to Delhi on 4th jan.

The train left the station exactly on time at 12:50 AM, which honestly surprised me.

I booked the ticket just a few days before departure, I got an upper berth since the lower ones were already taken. I wasn’t sure what to expect, but it turned out to be quite comfortable. I slept for most of the journey, which I didn’t expect on my first train ride.

Food was provided by the IRCTC staff. It was actually decent and hygienic, better than what I was expecting. The only downside was that from around 7 AM, the IRCTC people started moving around shouting “chai, coffee, breakfast” pretty loudly. They kept roaming through the coaches serving food, and it honestly felt a bit like a local market and waking me up from deep sleep.

Not sure if this is normal, but does this happen in 2A as well, or is it mostly a 3A/Sleeper thing?

Overall though, the experience felt calm and different.

Didn’t expect this, but I’ve actually developed a bit of interest in trains now. Feels like something I missed out on for a long time.

I feel a lot of guilt buying things for myself, even if its a chocolate or a bag of chips from the shops. I struggle to ask for time for myself. Anything that would bring me joy goes on the back burner. I've been on autopilot so long and bogged down for so long. I feel undeserving. I look at nice clothes I'd like to wear and just walk past them. I feel bad all the time. I know i shouldn't be this way but right now I just am. I can't convince myself out of it. To the point today where I didnt eat anything until 2pm or use the loo because I just had to see to everyone else first. No one noticed or asked if i had eaten yet or offered to make me something. That's something i struggled with as a teen, i always felt invisible at home being the youngest and everyone kept to themselves, ate befoe I got back from school amd then went to their own rooms. No one would check in with me. It makes me really disappointed in myself to be in that same place again. Recently I realised ive really been putting myself last to the point not going to the bathroom and not eating and not showering or going outside because something or someone else always needs attention, it's going to start affecting my health. 

I don't think I'm depressed, I just feel like a total zero with no support. Theres no one I could text saying 'hey im having a miserable time can I call you and talk?'. The other day I sent a friend a picture of a new restaurant I visited with my husband and kids, and said .why don't we meet up for a coffee?', aside from the fact she didnt reply to the message, she also called me to ask for directions because she was going there and just didnt say anything about having coffee there together. Anyway, thats not something new when I try to reach out. I also tried reaching out to another friend about some things on my mind and she replied saying we'll talk soon but never got back to my messaged and starting talking about other things and I hate to be a nag or seem needy. In reality, I actually do need some comfort. 

My husband has been a bit miserable himself and im trying not to make him more upset so theres no comfort there from him either. He and my son will be traveling for two weeks soon and initially he was a bit worried about me staying home alone for that time, and then we didnt talk about it again. When I asked him about it tonight saying, 'So I'll be staying home when you leave?', all he had to say was 'what do I care about where you stay'. And that just made me feel so small and insignificant

1q3zmqs,https://youtu.be/PdES5jL-xb0,Universal Studios Hollywood StarWay Escalator Audio Program Block I 2006 Soundtrack KUSH 4K,"From the Cow Missing archives, this video showcases the original StarWay escalator audio program block I that played at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2006. This was part of the park’s signature KUSH radio-style broadcast, which entertained guests with movie trivia, Universal sound bites, and safety reminders as they traveled between the Upper Lot (the Entertainment Center) and the Lower Lot (the Studio Center).  
  
Over the years, the program was updated to reflect changes in park attractions and seasonal overlays, including references to E.T. Adventure and special versions created for Halloween Horror Nights.  
  
The audio was produced in two-channel mono and played through a 70-volt system powered by more than 60 JBL Control Twenty-Five speakers and a Roland AR-2000 digital announcement recorder. Each loop contained multiple segments, each running four to six minutes, forming a complete broadcast of roughly twenty-five minutes.  
  
Installed in 1991 during a significant expansion of the park, the StarWay offered sweeping views of the Universal backlot and served as an essential link between the park's two main areas. Before Jurassic Park The Ride opened in 1996, Studio Tour trams even departed from beneath the escalators.  
  
The KUSH audio program remained on the StarWay until it was replaced in 2006 with a new NBC Access Hollywood-themed recording as part of a broader rebrand that more directly connected Universal Studios Hollywood with NBCUniversal entertainment.  
  
Universal Studios Hollywood is a renowned theme park and entertainment destination in Universal City, Los Angeles, California. It offers a variety of attractions, thrilling rides, captivating shows, and immersive experiences. Visitors can explore the famous backlot, embark on the Studio Tour, and enjoy a range of iconic rides and attractions, including Jurassic World: The Ride, The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, Transformers: The Ride 3D, Despicable Me Minion Mayhem, and The Simpsons Ride. The park also hosts seasonal events, such as Halloween Horror Nights, featuring immersive mazes and scare zones. With its combination of movie magic, thrilling adventures, and live entertainment, Universal Studios Hollywood provides an unforgettable experience for visitors of all ages.

We’re an Indian couple, currently based in **Gurgaon, India**, and are looking for advice on the best country to relocate to long-term.

We have travelled to multiple places around the world, and while staying in Gurgaon, we’re increasingly struggling with:

\- extremely high pollution and toxic air, which has become a year-round ordeal

\- poor civic infrastructure (traffic, construction chaos, noise)

\- lack of civic sense in daily life

overall impact on health, mental well-being, and quality of life

We’re both entrepreneurs and currently run our own businesses in India. As part of this move, we’re open to changing our business(as it can't be managed remotely) and would like to open a small, speciality coffee shop after relocating. We’re looking for a place where:

\- Independent cafés can realistically survive, and there's a good demand for coffee and tourism.

\- Quality of life and work–life balance are valued, plenty of nature and clean surroundings.

\- weather is not too extreme (mild to moderate winters are OK)

\- there is a clear pathway for long-term settlement so that we can retire there

At the moment, Portugal is our leading option (mainly due to its lifestyle, climate, and the D2 entrepreneur visa route). Still, we’re very open to other countries or cities that might be a better fit.

We’re not chasing fast money — more interested in sustainability, calm living, and building something meaningful.

Would really appreciate hearing from:

\- people who’ve moved from India

\- small business/café owners abroad

\- Anyone who’s evaluated multiple countries for similar reasons

1q3zlkt,https://www.reddit.com/r/AnorexiaNervosa/comments/1q3zlkt/my_mom_has_always_been_really_supportive_as_i/,My mom has always been really supportive as I battle anorexia,"Ever since my illness began, years ago, my mother was the very first person in my life to notice

My whole life, she's been so supportive

I have disabilities and require extra help and support. Since I was a child, she's always helped me with anything I needed

Whenever I was sick or hurt, she would take me to the doctor. If I needed help with a class in school, she was there to support me

Before I was anorexic, we never discussed losing weight with one another

No history of anorexia in my family, as far as I am aware

My mother has always loved to cook and prepare meals for people 

You can imagine how hurt she was, when she noticed me eating less, losing weight, becoming sicker

We had never talked about eating disorders before that

However, because she always packed my lunch for school, and always made sure I had a healthy breakfast before leaving for school, when I began to limit my food intake at school, sometimes even skipping lunch, due to anxiety, she became really concerned

She would always ask ""Did you eat lunch today at school?""

I wasn't anorexic at the time, but still, just knowing I may have been going without eating for long periods of time caused my mom to worry

At my naturally healthy weight, she would often tell me how pretty I was. It was a genuine comment that came from her heart, and she said it to me a lot. She fixed my hair for me often before school, curling it or braiding it. And always bought my clothes for me from my favorite stores. Back then, I was able to wake up, every day, look in the mirror, and feel good about my body. I didn't think about weight loss back then. And she wanted me to feel good about myself. 

Then one day, everything  changed. As soon I started losing weight, even though I wasn't saying anything about it, trying to keep it to myself, my mother knew right away it was a problem

She commented my clothes were fitting looser. She noticed me becoming more anxious around food, limiting foods I had previously enjoyed

She mentioned the words ""anorexia nervosa"" to me before I was willing to accept I was developing this illness

I brushed off her concern, or sometimes I ate what she fixed, so she wouldn't worry

But I could see the hurt and pain on her face, when I got sicker. She wasn't able to ignore it

Around my birthday one time, when I was really sick, she knew I had lost too much weight

She asked me to weigh myself in front of her, not realizing how low the number was

She broke down and cried when she saw the number on the scale

This memory has never left me

My dad also became concerned, trying to help and offer his support

But with my mother, to see me suffer from something this painful and complex, really hurt her, emotionally. 

She tried reading about anorexia . She drove me to lots of different therapists. Always preparing me anything I was willing to eat at the time

Still, the weight loss continued. And there were times in my life that she thought I was going to die from anorexia

When I had to be hospitalized, she tried her best to support me through it

If I had a favorite clothing item or blanket I wanted from home, she would bring it to me

I was really scared, being hospitalized 

It brightened my day, whenever her and my dad walked through the doors of the inpatient hospital to see me

They know how much I like Starbucks coffee. They got to take me off hospital grounds a few times, to get it

My mom knew the compulsive weighing had become a problem, and tried to get me to stop, several times

First, by asking to stop weighing myself as much

Even removing my scale a couple of times so I couldn't weigh myself

But I remember I got another scale after she removed the first one. 

I remember fainting in my dad's arms. And my mom running over to me

I remember my mother crying, when someone from my treatment team explained to her the severity of my medical complications from anorexia

I remember my mother wanting me to try inpatient hospitalization again, hoping this time, it would help me recover

And I remember that ever since I lost weight, she's never stopped offering to cook for me, and notices when there are changes in my health

Her comments are often centered around my weight loss, my food intake 

It's not all we talk about. But we can have conversations about anorexia, and listen to each other's perspective on it

She used to ask me how much I weigh, to make sure I wasn't losing any more weight

Even when I tried to hide it, she always noticed

For someone who shows their love, often by preparing and offering meals to others, seeing someone suffering from an illness that won't allow you to enjoy food, hurt her deeply

While my sister grew up, with no signs of anorexia or disordered eating, I went on to develop anorexia

It threw my mom into a world she wasn't prepared for

And she will always make sure she sees me eat something in front of her, when I am around her

Even calling me on the phone, asking me if I need anything and if I am making sure I am eating enough

She knows me well enough to understand that unexpected change is something I have a difficult time with

When preparing me a meal, she does her best to prepare it the way I like. 

When my anorexia first started, we used to argue about my food intake. 

I don't argue with her anymore about it

She loves me so much. She doesn't want my medical complications to get worse

She wants to see me healthy and happy

My anorexia is chronic at this point. I would say she's pretty patient with me, respecting my boundaries

She's happy I have a therapist and a nutritionist to help me

But as much as I wish I could not worry about my weight or food intake, sometimes it's difficult

It's hard when you are the only person in your family with an eating disorder

It's like it puts up this wall between yourself and others

The pain runs really deep.

My memories of my hospital stays stay with me

My dad also notices if I start limiting certain foods, because he's the one who buys my groceries for me

If I didn't have my parents support and encouragement, I would feel alone

My mother does her best

Looking back at how I was before anorexia, it probably makes her sad sometimes, because I still struggle greatly with this serious disorder

I almost died from anorexia

She was always by my side

She's empathetic, wanting to show how much she cares

She also notices changes in my mood, when I am depressed or anxious

Anorexia doesn't just affect you

It affects everyone around you

Though this disorder often wants to make me feel alone, I know I am not

The past 4 years have been hell for me (39 M).  I had to get on very strong meds,  gained 50 pounds,  isolated myself from friends and family.  But i finally got something nice going for myself.  7 months ago, after 23 years of cigarette,  I finally quit.  Like that.  With no prep.

I got myself in a bad situation that required a big physical effort on my behalf.  After half an hour,  I got absolutely sick. Vomiting, low blood pressure,  I came within an inch to pass out, miles away from civilisation, in the forest.  Scary stuff, when you stop and think about the possible implications.  This situation left such a huge mark on me that the mental image of a smoke now repulses me.  I wouldn't have thought in a thousand year that such a situation would be the trigger that would get me to stop, but here I am!!! Now what helps a lot is that I almost don't drink anymore because of the meds. I have less than 10 drinks a year. I never get to that point where your mind inevitably wanders towards smoking when drinks are involved.  I am so grateful for that. 

I started smoking weed the same year I started cigarette, at 16 yo. My weed consumption was pretty uneven during the first decade.  I smoked socially,  but I was social... every day.  Then I went from smoking during the day,  to only smoking at night to help me sleep.  So since then,  I have smoked weed pretty much every night of my life before going to bed.  

Now fast-forward to last week,  I went to visit a family member for the new year. I forgot my G*d d*mn weed.  I was in a sadm village,  no dispensaries, no connection. Now normally I world have moved mountains to find some cuz I simply a Can't sleep without it.  But for some reason,  I mustered the strength to look at myself and say: let's do this,  now is the time to stop.  

I am happy and proud to report that I haven't had any since,  and that I'm officially on day 8 free of cannabis. I haven't had a good night of sleep since,  and I suspect it might take a good month to begin to see some normalcy sleepwear. I look like shit,  I'm a bit grumpy,  I have way too much coffee and I'm tired all the time,  but I'm holding strong. And I won't give up.

It's not relevant to this group,  but I'm also on my way to being done with my meds,  so I can start losing weight again.  The late night munchies won't be a factor anymore either,  so for the first time in years,  I'm looking forward to LIVING.

So that's my story.  I had to share it with someone. 
Thank you for your time,  and don't give up on yourself.  Your time WILL come. Maybe not today,  maybe not tomorrow. But they will!

I learned quickly that you had to keep up with cleaning it and rinsing it constantly. I’ve also made sure to properly descale it. 

But now, when I set it to pressure mode, it’s not making the foam top. It’s still makes coffee fine (I think? I’m not much of a coffee expert), but it seems like the pressure feature doesn’t work, which was kind of the big selling point for me.

I’ve gone through all the motions trying to clean it and test it, but I feel like I’m just wasting pods and water at this point. I’m thinking I need to just deal with it not making the foam or just return it because it might be a motor issue..

- Water: 420g @ 185 F

Given this is the Hoop, there's not much technique, just add coffee to the center then water to the hoop. I give the center column a gentle stir once I'm done pouring, since often a lot of the grounds float to the top.

What are local roasters to you that you think can compete with the nordic gods and glazed kings of this sub?

I'll start. Florida, as it turns out, has an incredible coffee culture. We actually have a club of state roasters that lets you get discounts and events at any participant.

I'll start with Bold Bean, in Jacksonville FL. I visited these guys when visiting my sister, just because they were the closest cafe. As it turns out, they gave me what is to this day in the top-3 pourovers I've ever had. Incredible boldness and clarity.

  
For Christmas, I got these two bags. I've mostly had funky naturals from them, but their washed options still bang.

Next is Superwow, based in Hollywood (they also have a cafe in brazil, and will soon open in manhattan so they aren't staying ""local"" much longer). They are themed after japanese stock car racing. Think an ""Inital D"" coffee shop.

But, that japanese part is not just theming. What if I told you that a short drive from Miami, you can have a cup of Glitch or Apollon's Gold?

Yes, these guys have Glitch and Apollon's Gold on their menu. I say menu because apparently one of you monsters bought literally every bag they had. But, their own coffee feels distinctly japanese: tea-like, clear beyond compare. Probobly the most ""premium"" and ""elite"" coffee in the state. Their baristas are really chatty too, and love to talk shop if you say the word ""V60""

My last shoutout is to Haan coffee in Orlando.

The mills district of Orlando Florida is known for being a home to vietnamese refugees following the Vietnam War. This area expanded to a thriving Asian-American district a 20 minute jaunt from the Mouse, and as you can tell by the bag these guys are Korean

  
Haan is a little bit of an enigma. They don't really participate much in Florida Coffee Culture, not accepting the keychain discount most specialty shops now do. They are surrounded by Pho and Boba, so as you can imagine the place is packed full of Asian-American students studying (theres also a famous VTuber artist who I won't identify who brings a full setup there. They've had to install ""no laptop"" seats for people who just want coffee)

Finally, their coffee is REALLY expensive. This Columbian Natural from Rodrigo Sanchez costs 42 dollars for 230g. But by god does is it worth it. They don't actually do pourovers in the cafe, using an automated SP9 instead. As a result, their cups are similarly as clean as Superwow, though the texture I think is stronger.

Unless I go to Cultiva, my personal fave (no ties to it, I just love their coffee) It seems that no matter what I order, it comes heavily sugar and some sort of sticky caramely or vanilla-y syrup whether I ask for it or not. 

Case in point today after my errands I stopped at the drive-thru of 1893 on Havelock avenue and ordered a breve. A breve as most of you know is a couple of shots with half n half instead of milk. Basically a latte with half n half. No added flavors, sweeteners or syrups. 

What did I get? Oh I got a sort of breve all right,  but I got it with a lot of sugar and some sort of caramelly syrup. Basically a coffee pudding --which is not what I wanted. I wanted a plain old breve. Because I didn't start sipping till I was halfway home. I just ate the ""dessert"" which I didn't even want. Mind you that 12 oz Breve or what they call a breve is nine bucks at this place.

I find it nuts that these people whose business it is to know coffee drinks don't knowcoffee drinks....like, you had one job.

Sigh. I guess I stick with Cultiva.

Do other people find this? Is there any other place that knows their coffee drinks and gives you exactly what you ask for without adding a bunch of
bow ties and glitter and sugar cubes to it without asking you?

Should I keep going on dates with the guy who keeps asking to pay for dates?","(Sorry it's a long post...I put TLDR at the very bottom)

I have been talking to this guy for over three weeks now. We met on Tinder and we were both looking for a relationship in the app. But because we couldn't meet earlier due to our holiday commitments, we ended up talking for two weeks (which is too long for both of us) then met in person last week.

When we met for a dinner on the first date, the bill came to around $120. I wouldn't say it was a fancy dinner place as I live in a very big city and my previous dates have taken me out to much fancier places and paid way more than that before (like $150-200 easy on many occasions and some guys took me out to some Michelin starred places that costed a lot more...and I didn't ask any of this, they volunteered to take me...). I would say this was kind of between fancy and casual. So I was quite shocked when he so casually asked me to split (he ate way more than me anyways and I drunk less too only a glass of champagne). Honestly I was flabbergasted inside because out of 20+ dates in the past 6 months, I had never been asked by any men on the first date to split the bill. I have offered to pay after a few dates when I went to multiple venues or volunteered to pay for drinks, but these men always declined my offer, as it is considered polite in where I live to do so. So I bought some drinks or some deserts on second or third date just to show them appreciation. But I had never been asked to pay for a first date. Extremely disappointing and I found him inappropriate.

But I didn't say anything when he asked. I just looked down trying not to show my utter disappointments inside and I just said ""ok"". Because I liked him. But inside I was really disappointed. Because he said he was really attracted to me and he asked me to go for a coffee after the dinner. I am pretty sure he saw my expression too because as soon as I looked up he looked quite guilty or something for asking me to split? and He changed his mind asking just 40% can you pay? I mean what is this guy I thought. I kind of wanted to leave the place there honestly at that moment. Because he lacked manners like this. I hate a guy who doesn't know basic dating etiquette like this. And it is not like we were complete strangers as we talked in the chat for so long like 2.5 weeks walls of text, it can be a book after we were matched. He said he would love to do ""dating"" stuff like dinners etc. But sure he wanted me to pay for it and he thought he could win my heart like this? Not sure what he was thinking. 

How is he in a person? He is good looking and very fit. Cute smile. A full head of hair. I am fit too and I only go out with athletic men mostly but he was the fittest guy I have met so far, and I found him attractive this time (he is a professional athlete/trainer), as he was to me. He has a wonderful personality so far, and easy to talk to. He never argues, which is surprising. He has a Master's degree and he writes really well too, which I liked. I like his communication style. I think he lean towards liberal thinking in terms of beliefs however. And I do not. I also live in a traditional country currently. I tend to lean more towards conservative values because of this (I am a product of the environment after all). I seek someone who makes more than me, who can lead me in a relationship and treat me like a lady. I value chivalry at least while courting me till we are exclusive in a relationship. Like when he asked me to pay for it, I felt cheap like he was looking for a fling honestly. Maybe his words were cheap? Because he talks a lot about how he wants to hold me, wants to hold me in his arms, how he wants to do things in bed etc. which I don't really find respectful honestly. I was surprised to see the text that said he wanted to feel my weight on him and smell my hair etc. even after the first date. I found this borderline inappropriate but a little flattering? as this kind of showed he felt strong attractions towards me. But he seemed to be too sexual so early on, which I told him to stop now. Like this is borderline inappropriate for me. 

He paid for the cafe after though. I think it was about $40, which he paid saying ""I'll pick this up"" like twice as it means so much...and I didn't say anything. Because the guys I am used to dating locally, they all just pay for it without saying anything. Of course I say thank you and show appretiation like thanks for the wonderful time etc. I just think he comes from different kind of environment. He is not my vibe of men I usually date...

I went on another date with another man earlier, and we went to a fancy dinner place on a first date he picked (the bill came to about $200), then a movie ($65, it was one of those fancy IMAX theater 3D movie and movies are more expensive here than the US/Canada), and two bars in separate venues and he never asked me to pay for anything. This is the type of guy I am used to date here. And they make sure I am treated like a lady. I did give him a kiss on his lips actually before saying goodbye as I appreciated it. And I liked him he was nice to me. But that didn't work out as he took way too many business trips.

TLDR; Should I just keep dating this guy though he may not be the vibe of men I ususually date and asked me to pay for the first date? I am just afraid he would keep asking me to pay for all of the dates and probably I would get frustrated if he did that. Because I don't think this is a romantic date but a platonic friendship type thing if he keeps asking me to pay for dates. I wouldn't be able to take him seriously as a romantic interest. I also don't like a partner who relies on a woman financially. It's looked down upon in here too. This is not my vibe.

We fell in love at first sight, and after just one month of dating, we started living together.

During that first month before we moved in, he always tried to pay for everything for me. I didn’t want that, so I tried to split things fairly. If he paid for meals, I’d usually pay for coffee or something small.

About a week before we moved in together, he texted me asking to borrow about $50. He said he didn’t have enough money to pay his rent. At the time, he was living at a friend’s place and his rent was only $80, which already felt strange. Still, I sent him the money, and he paid me back as soon as he got his weekly paycheck.

Right after I moved into his place, he asked to borrow another $30, saying he didn’t have enough to pay his bills. I sent him the money again, and once again, he paid me back after getting paid. We had agreed to split rent, bills, and living expenses evenly, and I thought that was completely normal and fair.

About one or two months after living together, I started to understand why he never had money. He was supposed to work five days a week, but he would usually skip at least two days, saying he was sick, had a headache, or had a stomachache. The thing is, even when he didn’t go to work, he had no problem playing games all day and all night. That’s when I started thinking he was extremely lazy.

Later, I found out he was doing drugs, even though he knew very well that I hate drugs more than anything in the world. I told him clearly that if he didn’t work and kept using drugs, I would leave him. He apologized, said he was reflecting on himself, and promised he would never do it again. Because I loved him, I forgave him.

Now, almost two years into living together, I feel like I want to break up with him every single day.

We decided to move to a new city together. He said he would save money so we could live on our own, just the two of us, but he didn’t. He apologized again. In the end, I paid for almost everything by myself: the moving costs, two months of rent, the bond, bills, groceries, furniture, basically everything.

In the new city, he found a job first while I was unemployed, so he paid for two months of rent. Then he got fired because he was often sick and late. Around that time, I got a job, and that’s when things really started to feel like hell.

For almost a year now, I’ve been paying nearly all the rent, living expenses, and bills. His car was involved in an accident, and I paid $2,000 for the repair. He said he would take out a loan to cover it, but I paid instead and told him to pay me back, because loans come with interest.

Since moving to this city about a year and a half ago, he’s been fired from three jobs, including the most recent one. Out of those 18 months, he was unemployed for about 8 months. He always told me he was trying hard to find a job, but what I actually saw was him gaming all night, every night. He plays games at least 10 hours a day. It didn’t look like he was making any real effort at all. I kept telling him to go out and do something, anything. And just like that, 8 months passed.

Throughout all of this, I tried to break up with him about five times. Every time, he cried and begged me not to leave.

He is a New Zealand citizen, and I’m a foreigner. Through him, I was granted a 5-year visa, and we were planning to apply for a partner visa in the future. But now I keep thinking that I just want to stop everything. Sometimes I wonder if he’s using my weak points against me.

The confusing part is that he doesn’t treat me badly. He always whispers that he loves me, looks at me with warm and loving eyes, and is very affectionate. It feels like he truly loves me for who I am.

But as time goes by, I realize that none of his sweet words or promises have actually been kept.

It feels like he loves me, but at the same time, it doesn’t feel like love. He’s always saying he’s sorry and that he’s trying, but I don’t see any effort. He always says he’ll change, but nothing ever changes.

At first, I loved him so much that I believed he would change. But now it’s been over two years. Nothing has changed at all.

**2) Changes I have found can be see on the excel sheet here:** [https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQo3QW0tIuqJujLIonXDK-svnYkb7UgduC1eGpRqgnw/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQo3QW0tIuqJujLIonXDK-svnYkb7UgduC1eGpRqgnw/edit?usp=sharing)

**3) My follow-up posts will be on** r/AccordingToMyResearch 

\* Removed files can only appear on the final version if there was a duplicate file with a different name on Version 1. I have not looked for those. Details and specifics explained below. //



The research has hit a small snag: Some thumbnails on Version 1 don't match with their file images. I am unable to determine a cause for this. I hoped that looking into it further could reveal a pattern, but I am still at a loss. I've noted down more specifics towards the end of this post. It is also taking longer than anticipated for me to follow the journey of some renamed items. The item #'s listed come from Version 1 of Volume 8 as found on Jmail (JDrive), unless stated otherwise.

I have not verified if any of these changed or removed items can be found in the final release. There are less items on the final release, so one can conclude these were either duplicates or removed for a particular reason. There are a lot (A LOT) of duplicated files on the final release, so it is unclear why these files, in specific, have been removed. Further investigation is likely required.

I will post the data I have and move this investigation to r/AccordingToMyResearch as I'm thankful to CoffeeZilla and Jfiles for giving me the ability to investigate this further and don't want to take away space from other important investigations, topics, etc. 



**I'm not doing:**

* The files at the end of JDrive Volume 8 first drop seem to be in a different file format and they are listed out of numerical order. As far as I can tell, these files seem to be duplicates, so I am not logging them. If that is false, please let me know. 
* I did not read very long files (the ones that are hundreds of pages, for example). In these cases, I counted the item number in the sequence to see if the totals lined up with the new amount.
* I'm not comparing the completely censored pages to find out if they were duplicates. I have no way to do this, personally. Instead, I listed the ones that were removed out of sequence, and the total number of pages of vast darkness (fully redacted pages).



**I will try to do:**

* Review removed video footage to check if any items were duplicates. This includes noting location, date, and starting time on the timestamp. I started this, but decided posting part two is more of a priority for now. 
* Review the thumbnail errors and their relating files for PII. That is a project in itself, and I will likely lump that into a further study.. counting the number of repeated documents on the final version. x.X 
* I plan to compare the excel files, videos, and audio files that made it to the final version to make sure they match the originals.



**What I have learned about the file changes:**

* Approximately 590 pages of Redacted material was removed. That is around 78 files that contain either complete darkness, a short title page followed by darkness, and a few where only the cover page is darkness. 
* 10 removed files that only have that title sheet: Exhibit B(16642), Exhibit C(11379), Exhibit D(11384), Exhibit E(11387), Exhibit f(11611), Exhibit F(11618), Exhibit H(11671), Exhibit G(24055). 
* Exhibit D(11626) Was also skipped, but it does contain information. Judge names and Lawyer are mostly edited out; no victim details.
* There are files that had readable content when they were removed: 9985,10807, 10809, 11157, 11254, 11397, 11579, 11626, 14160, 14082, 14107, 16338, 16863, 16824, 16922, 18308, 20121, 24015, 24047, 24512, 20178, 38907. Please let me know if any or all of these can be found on Version 3.

Again, I haven't check to see if these removed files have duplicates in Version 1 (making them available on the final release). That is part of my next project. I will also be attempting to make it easier to understand volume 8.



**Interesting things I learned from reading removed files:** (maybe it was known, but I didn't know)

* Legal document uses ""Ghilsaine Borgerson"" as a possible alias for Ghilsaine Maxwell.
* Someone (I think an investigator?) thought they were communicating with Mar a Lago's in-house counsel only to find out that Mar a Lago apparently didn't have one at the time.
* Sometimes, but not every time, a few victims were referred to as ""co-conspirators.""
* The Maxwell case was heavily redacted, even as it was happening. They redacted discovery materials, and they pretty much redacted documentation saying that redactions took place. And then when the first judge passed away, they had to figure out what to even do with those documents.
* Someone seems to have had access to related case files in or before 2021, who possibly shouldn't have.



Why do certain files on Version 1 have the wrong thumbnails? I cannot figure out a pattern. They have the thumbnail of the item of their own name in the final version. For example: Item #36305 in version 1 has the thumbnail for #37403 in version 2, which lines up with item #36305 in the final release. Which makes sense. Perhaps the thumbnail for version 3 is writing over the thumbnail in the upload of version 1. What I can't understand is why would it only be random items getting the wrong thumbnail. For example, there is an item #36297, the thumbnail matches the file and it hasn't been replaced by the thumbnail #36297 in the final version. And Version 1 item #16378 contains the same thumbnail and item but it is #16034 in version 2 and #16034 in version 3 as well. Maybe someone is intentionally calling attention to these? Maybe it is a glitch that I don't understand.

  
I will accept feedback. I need a vacation.

I’m an international student in the U.S. and recently started using Tinder to go on dates. I matched with a woman who said she was in town for only 2–3 weeks for a professional event and was looking for something short-term and casual. She suggested meeting the same morning for coffee or breakfast and asked if I could give her a ride.

I picked her up from her hotel. I didn’t even get out of the car, she got in, and we decided to go to Starbucks. We got drinks and food, and while we were sitting there she suddenly brought up going to CVS to “get protection” and then go back to her hotel or somewhere mutual.

I told her we didn’t need to do that and that I already had protection at my place. She immediately pushed back and said she wouldn’t go to my place and insisted we go to CVS first. Then she started saying I needed to buy her a gift card or something. That’s when alarm bells went off and I realized this felt like a setup or scam.

She kept pressuring me to drive to CVS even though I was clearly uncomfortable. I eventually drove to one, but it was a CVS with a grocery section, and she refused to go inside, saying she wanted a different one. At that point I told her I didn’t want to do anything physical and that maybe we could go on another date sometime. She got angry and started saying I was wasting her time.

Then things escalated. She started recording me, claiming I had brought her flowers (which I did, I thought this was a real date). She said she was “famous on TikTok” and threatened to make me go viral. I pulled out my phone and recorded her as well, including her face and what she was saying.

For clarity: I never touched her, never made a move, didn’t even shake her hand. I just wanted to end the situation safely. I told her I would drive her back to her hotel, which I did. Before getting out, she took a photo of my license plate.

This happened Sunday morning in Dallas, Texas.

I’m shaken up and honestly worried, about the video, about false accusations, and about whether I should do anything proactively.

My questions: •	Was this a known scam or extortion tactic? •	Should I file a police report or at least document this somewhere? •	Is there anything I should do to protect myself legally, especially as an international student?

Posting this both for advice and so others can be careful. Thanks in advance.",1,1767555046.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

The disappearance of tips in food delivery isn’t just an economic issue.
It’s a mental health one.

Over the past year, DoorDash has quietly redesigned its app in ways that make tipping harder to see, harder to complete, and easier to miss entirely. The immediate effect is lower pay for drivers. The deeper effect is harder to quantify but impossible to ignore: longer hours, deeper isolation, and a workforce increasingly made up of men sitting alone in cars, night after night, absorbing stress in silence.

Drivers noticed first. Orders that once reliably included tips now arrive with zeros — even for long distances, grocery shopping, holidays, bad weather, and complex orders. When drivers ask customers whether tipping was even presented as an option, the response is increasingly the same: “I didn’t see one.” “I couldn’t figure it out.” “It only showed up later.”

These aren’t cheap customers. They’re confused ones.

We tip someone for pouring a drink that takes thirty seconds.
We tip someone for walking a plate ten feet across a room.
We tip someone for handing us a coffee we ordered ourselves.

Yet the person who drives across town, navigates traffic and weather, communicates with restaurants, problem-solves missing items, shops groceries aisle by aisle, fights dead zones in freezer aisles and concrete warehouses, and logs into store Wi-Fi just to make sure you get the right frozen pizza — now has a harder time receiving a tip than a barista.

Of all modern service jobs, delivery is among the most tip-worthy. And yet tipping has been deliberately obscured.

This isn’t an accident.

Making tipping less visible lowers the perceived cost of ordering. It helps keep customers clicking “place order” and maintains pricing relationships with restaurants. But the real cost doesn’t disappear — it’s displaced.

That cost is paid by drivers, not just in fuel, vehicle wear, time, and risk, but in mental health, stability, and the ability to have any kind of life outside the car. When tips vanish, drivers don’t clock out — they work longer. And when work expands to fill every available hour, everything else contracts.

Trapped by the Pay Model

DoorDash didn’t just reduce earnings. It removed financial escape velocity.

Drivers used to earn modestly — not well, but reliably — with one crucial feature: access to their money every day. Instant pay came with a fee, but daily access meant rent got paid, fuel went in the tank, groceries got bought. Life stayed barely functional.

As earnings dropped and pay access tightened, that stability disappeared.

Now many drivers can’t afford to leave.

Taking a traditional job means waiting two or three weeks for a first paycheck while still covering daily expenses. Even when drivers secure other employment, many are forced to keep driving for DoorDash just to survive the gap. Longer hours. Worse pay. More stress.

This isn’t flexibility anymore. It’s dependency.

DoorDash is not a struggling startup. It generates billions in revenue, funds corporate salaries and expansion, and operates sophisticated systems designed to optimize margins. A workforce that can’t afford to leave isn’t flexible. It’s exploited.

When the System Fails, the Driver Pays

There is another rarely discussed reality of delivery work: when DoorDash’s own payment system fails, the cost is often pushed onto the driver.

Drivers regularly encounter situations where in-app payment cards decline or orders fail to process — through no fault of their own. In those moments, drivers are effectively given two options: pay for the order out of pocket and wait up to 24 hours for reimbursement, or spend 30 to 40 minutes on hold with support while an active delivery stalls.

For workers living day to day, paying out of pocket is not a minor inconvenience. It can mean overdrafts, missed bills, or choosing between completing the delivery and having enough money left for fuel or food. Waiting on hold isn’t neutral either — it’s unpaid time, often while the algorithm continues to penalize delays.

This is not flexibility.
It is risk transfer.

Isolation Is Part of the Job

Food delivery is not a socially neutral job. In practice, it is overwhelmingly male — not by policy, but by reality. Walking alone at night into unfamiliar buildings, down dark alleys, through parking garages and poorly lit lobbies carries different risks depending on who you are. Many women reasonably opt out.

The result is a workforce that is largely male, working alone, for long hours, directed by an app.

Drivers have no coworkers. No shared space. No break room. No supervisor who knows their name. They sit alone in cars for hours, navigating traffic, financial pressure, ratings, and algorithmic judgment — often without a single meaningful human interaction.

When tips disappear and earnings fall, the only way to survive is to work more. More nights alone. Fewer social connections. Less time with family. A growing sense of invisibility.

DoorDash didn’t create male loneliness — but its design choices are actively making it worse.

What the Viral Reddit Post Reveals — and What It Doesn’t

A viral Reddit post recently claimed that DoorDash intentionally suppresses tipping to reduce apparent order costs and protect restaurant partnerships.

Some elements of that post align closely with drivers’ lived experience. Others remain unproven.

What appears consistent and observable is clear: tipping has become less visible; customers are confused about when and how to tip; prompts appear later in the order flow; and earnings volatility has increased without meaningful base-pay increases.

What remains speculative are claims of explicit internal directives or deliberate efforts to eliminate tips entirely. Those allegations may or may not prove true.

But they don’t need to.

Because even without insider leaks, the outcome is already visible. The platform may succeed in making delivery look cheaper on a screen, but the real cost shows up elsewhere — in exhaustion, depression, isolation, and lives narrowed down to a driver’s seat and a countdown timer.

The Cost No One Accounts For

When income becomes unpredictable, tips become invisible, and exit becomes unaffordable, work expands to fill every available hour — and everything else shrinks.

When a company controls pay visibility, access to income, workload, and dispute resolution — while denying responsibility for the human consequences — it isn’t neutral. It is choosing to externalize the cost of doing business onto mental health and onto people’s ability to live anything resembling a full life.

That cost doesn’t appear in quarterly earnings.

It shows up later, quietly, in ways that are much harder to undo.

What Could Change — Now

None of this requires radical reform.

DoorDash could restore clear, upfront tipping visibility.
It could guarantee base pay that reflects time, distance, and complexity.
It could provide instant pay access without penalty.
It could stop shifting technical failures onto drivers.
And it could publicly disclose how tipping prompts are tested, timed, and displayed.

These are design choices — not inevitabilities.

Transparency wouldn’t harm customers or restaurants. It would simply stop hiding the real cost of delivery behind the people least able to absorb it.

I’m not making this post as an ego post. Not my intention to seek any kind’ve attention or glory lol. Just wanted to share something and see if I’m being “weird” or if there’s any deeper meaning to it that I should glean.

Story time…

Earlier today, where I work, we found a mouse that had died near our bathroom. We get them at work during the winter time, and our maintenance guys set traps for them.

We found a mouse that looked to have succumbed to the poison they use, and was there laying on the floor.

As I went to pick him up, I was suddenly moved with compassion. I made the sign of the cross, and scooped him up into a plastic coffee cup.

I took him to a spot outside and buried him in some mulch nearby. I said a prayer, thanked God for his life, made the sign of the cross again, then left.

It felt right to me to do this, but I’m not exactly sure what this internally means? Can’t explain why I felt so strongly about making sure this mouse died well, or was at least cared for at the end. 

I’d enjoy any thoughts or ideas anyone might have on it as spiritual insight.

1q3yz78,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_PensoNotes/comments/1q3yz78/mastering_rapid_logging_in_penso_notes/,Mastering Rapid Logging in Penso Notes,"We’ve all been there: a million ""to-dos"" swirling in your head, a sudden spark of a project idea, and the looming dread of a 3 PM meeting. When we try to juggle all of this mentally, our brains experience a ""system slowdown.""

This is where Rapid Logging comes in.

At its core, Rapid Logging is the ""shorthand"" of the Bullet Journal (BuJo) method, created by Ryder Carroll. It’s more than just a list of chores; it’s a cognitive hack. By using a simple system of symbols and short phrases, you can offload mental clutter and reclaim your focus.

**Why It Works: The ""External Brain""**

Cognitive science tells us that our working memory is a limited resource. When you try to remember to ""buy milk"" while writing a report, your brain uses energy to keep that milk reminder active. This is known as the Zeigarnik Effect—the tendency for the brain to nag us about unfinished tasks.

Rapid logging ""closes the loop."" By externalizing the thought, your brain gets explicit permission to stop mentally rehearsing the task. While traditional notebooks are great, Penso Notes takes this a step further by providing a ""Digital External Brain"" that is always with you, searchable, and secure.

**The Core Language**

To start, stop writing sentences. Use a standardized syntax within your Penso feed:

Tasks (•): Actionable items (e.g., • Draft budget)

Events (○): Date-related entries (e.g., ○ Lunch @ 1pm)

Notes (–): Facts, ideas, or observations (e.g., – Found a great new coffee shop)

In Penso, you can take this ""telegraphic"" style and enhance it with multimedia. Sometimes a ""Note"" is better captured as a quick voice memo or a photo of a whiteboard—Penso lets you mix these seamlessly into your daily log.

**The Pro Move: Signifiers**

Add Signifiers to the left of your bullets to add context at a glance. In Penso, you can customize your bullet keys to fit your workflow:

Priority (\*): For particularly essential items (e.g., \* • Submit tax form)

Inspiration (!): For sudden flashes of brilliance or new ideas

Research (👁): For things that require further looking into

**How to Rapid Log with Penso**

Whether you are a BuJo purist or a digital native, the workflow is built for speed.

**1. The Daily Dump** Don’t wait for a ""planning session."" In Penso’s messenger-style interface, you can ""text"" entries the moment they occur. Keep them brief:

Instead of: ""I really need to remember to call the plumber about the leaky sink.""

Write: • Call plumber (sink)

**2. The Status Update** As you move through your day, update your progress. Penso makes this interactive:

X = Task Completed

\> = Migrated (Moved to tomorrow or a specific diary)

< = Scheduled (Linked to your centralized calendar)

**3. The Smart Migration (The Secret Sauce)** At the end of the day, look at your open bullets. In a paper journal, rewriting is the filter. In Penso, you use the Swipe-to-Migrate gesture. This forced pause prevents you from carrying over ""zombie tasks"" that don't actually matter.

**Tailored Insights: Tricks for Every User**

**For the Student:** Use nested bullets for lectures. While handwriting is great for retention, Penso’s audio capture allows you to record the lecture while rapid-logging key points, giving you a complete sensory map of the class.

**For the Busy Professional:** Use the ""Interstitial Journaling"" method. Between tasks, rapid-log what you just finished and what you'll do next (e.g., ""X Finished Q3 Report | • Next: Review email""). It clears the mental fog and helps you transition into deep work faster.

**For the Creative:** Use a dedicated ""Idea Inbox"" diary. In Penso, you can have separate journals for ""Work,"" ""Personal,"" and ""Creative Sparks,"" ensuring your big ideas don't get lost in your grocery list.

**Template Sentences for Your Daily Log**

**Task** • \[Action Verb\] \[Object\]

**Event:** ○ \[Event Name\] @ \[Time/Location\]

**Observation**: – \[Key Fact or Thought\]

**Priority**: \* • \[Crucial Task\]

**Inspiration**: ! – \[New Idea\]

Here are examples and template sentences for each of the core rapid logging categories:

**Task Start: • \[Action Verb\] \[Object\]**

A task is an actionable item that requires a specific outcome. Using an action verb at the start helps clarify exactly what needs to be done.

• Draft Q1 marketing budget.

• Call plumber regarding the kitchen sink.

• Schedule dental cleaning for next Tuesday.

• Update the team project schedule.

• Review client feedback from the morning meeting.

**Event Entry: ○ \[Event Name\] @ \[Time/Location\]**

Events are date-related or time-specific occurrences. They should be logged as succinctly as possible, focusing on objective details.

○ Staff Meeting @ 9:00 AM in Conference Room B.

○ Sarah’s Wedding @ 4:00 PM on June 24th.

○ Lunch with Alex @ The Corner Café.

○ Annual Health Checkup @ City General Hospital.

○ Digital Marketing Webinar @ 11:00 AM via Zoom.

**Observation: – \[Key Fact or Thought\]**

Notes are used for facts, ideas, and observations that you want to remember but aren't immediately actionable.

– Note: The new coffee blend from the local café has a very rich flavor.

– Fact: Project funding must be secured by the end of Q3.

– Thought: Felt much more energized after a 20-minute morning workout.

– Observation: Team productivity seems to dip slightly on Tuesday afternoons.

– Idea: Consider using a subscription model for the new app project.

**Priority: \* • \[Crucial Task\]**

A priority signifier is placed to the left of a task to highlight it as one of the most important items for the day.

\* • Submit final tax forms before 5:00 PM.

\* • Finalize the presentation slides for the board meeting.

\* • Confirm travel arrangements for next month’s conference.

\* • Respond to the high-priority client inquiry regarding the contract.

\* • Complete the primary coding sprint for the website update.

**Inspiration: ! – \[New Idea\]**

The inspiration signifier is typically paired with a note to mark great ideas, personal mantras, or sudden insights.

! – Idea: Start a weekly podcast featuring local entrepreneurs.

! – Insight: Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication.

! – Concept: Create a ""15-minute task list"" for quick household chores.

! – Project: Design a custom set of signifiers tailored specifically for my design workflow.

! – Reflection: Celebrating small wins daily builds significant long-term momentum.

Safe for a solo visitor.
Maybe a nice cafe nearby to grab a bite.

1q3yw4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1q3yw4b/will_mortgage_companies_believe_that_i_spend/,Will mortgage companies believe that I spend hardly anything?,"A bit of background is probably needed, me and my mother own a small coffee shop. For the first 18 months it did not earn enough to pay me so I became incredibly frugal, a habit I have continued. But it is doing well now and I now take home around 50k a year for the past 2 years and it has allowed me to save for a house deposit so I can move out. I paid of all of my CC debt and a loan I took out a few years ago. Once I was completely debt free I started saving. I have managed to save 25k in 7 months. 

I know this is almost all of my earnings but I do not pay rent or bills as I am living at home, I eat food at the coffee shop and I walk to work.

 I try to only spend money if I can justify it as a business expense so it comes out of the businesses bank account not my personal account. Aside from a few books etc, ~£30 a month on toiletries and money coming in, my bank statement is blank, I would say my monthly spend averages around the £50/60 mark. June 2025 actually had nothing come out at all.

Will lenders find this suspicious? Will they assume I have another bank account I’m not showing them? Do I need to purchase odd things to make it more believable?

1q3yvds,https://i.redd.it/0fcge3shudbg1.jpeg,Don't Talk To Me Until I've Had My Strega - A Coffee Cocktail,"I took the idea of a Chartreuse Cappuccino and made it a proper cocktail, rather than a cafe-style drink. There’s of ton of complexity in this drink, you get a lot of coffee upfront, which gives way to a ton of herbal complexity with the three different liquors we have going on. All of that is supported by the bourbon, giving the drink the right heat and backbone. The drink finishes refreshing and minty and lingers on the palate. This is easily one of my favorite coffee cocktails.

Don’t Talk To Me Until I’ve Had My Strega Cocktail Spec

* 1.5oz Cold Brew Concentrate (2x [like the Stumptown brand](https://www.smithbrothersfarms.com/stumptown-cold-brew-concentrate))
* 1oz Liquore Strega
* 1oz Bourbon (high proof 90+)
* 0.5oz Jägermeister
* 0.5oz Benedictine
* 0.25oz Vegan Foamer ([like Kevin Kos’ Super Foam](https://www.kevinkos.com/post/super-foam-egg-replacement))
* Saline

Combine ingredients into Shaker Tin, add ice. Shake until cold. Double Strain into chilled small stemless glass.

I reached out a couple of days after the breakup offering support if she wanted it, and she was very kind but said she couldn’t accept it. I accepted that, and didn’t text again for a good while. During that time she watched all of my stories like it was a part time job, even if she was travelling (went back home to Australia for the holidays) or with family/friends.

I texted her a couple of days ago asking if we could go for coffee or just generally talk before we go back to our postgrads. It turned out that she’s extended her trip so she’s still in Australia, but she was happy to have a conversation and offered to FaceTime. I didn’t feel like it was fair to do that because I didn’t want to take away from her family time, so we agreed to talk when she’s back in the country we’re both studying in in a couple of weeks.

The purpose of this (for me) is to own my side of things and to see if we can move forward together with the added context of neither of us being ready for the intensity we had. 

I don’t know if I’ve done this right? And I don’t know how to read if she’s seeing this as closure or not, she was kind and said she hoped I’d had a nice Christmas but no questions or anything (in fairness, I also didn’t ask any questions beyond asking to have a quick chat and she hates texting at the best of times).

I kept contact with everyone. Visit them from time to time, but never them. Where I live (still there today) I went out. Try to meet new people, but it never clicked. Tried to date, but was tired of hearing that i'm either short or my income won't follow her (happened twice for this one).

  
Been 5 years since I had a date. Been almost 10 years since I went out meeting a real friend. I just do my things in life. Gym, work, going out for a coffee etc etc and going back to school at the end of 2026.

I realized that I just don't want to try it anymore. That I gave my best shot, but things in life doesn't go the way you always want it to be and i'm at peace with this. Peace doesn't mean that I am happy with the outcome, but I know that the sad part is long gone.

**Once more before Thursday's Q2 Financials & conference call.**

# Tying the Dots: 

**Tilray's Strategic Positioning Amid U.S. Cannabis Policy Shifts**

**The past few months have seen a series of interconnected developments in the U.S. cannabis space that are lining up perfectly for companies like Tilray (TLRY).** 

**These aren't random events—they're building a clear path toward bigger medical market access, lower barriers, and serious growth potential for anyone already positioned right.** 

# Here's how it all connects, step by step, and why Tilray looks primed to benefit big time.

\- **October: Setting the Stage with VA Imports and Massive Production Ramp-Up**

**October 8 marked the close of the public comment period for the VA's request to import THC and CBD extracts for their Cooperative Studies Program—no negative comments, no delays reported. This is aimed at researching cannabis for veteran issues like PTSD and chronic pain, and with the comment period clearing smoothly, approvals could move fast, potentially opening imports and trials in Q1 or Q2 2026.**

**The very next day, October 9, on Tilray's Q1 earnings call, Irwin Simon dropped the news that they're converting the huge 1.3 million sq ft Gatineau facility in Quebec from 80% partial veggie production to full cannabis. 100%!** 

**That's adding up to 100 tonnes (100,000 kg) of capacity over the next 6-12 months, on top of their existing 210+ tonnes and #1 share in Canada.** 

# The timing feels too spot-on to be coincidence. 

**Tilray's got veteran programs running in Canada and solid export experience— they're a natural fit to supply GMP-grade product for VA research or imports.** 

**Simon sounded confident about new sales channels on the call, and it's hard not to think U.S. medical/VA opportunities are part of that picture.** 

**This expansion looks like they're gearing up in advance.**

\- **December: Trump's EO Lights the Fuse, Tilray Moves Instantly**

**December 18: Trump signs the Executive Order directing the DOJ and DEA to fast-track rescheduling cannabis to Schedule III.** 

**This changes everything—ends 280E tax penalties, allows pharmacy prescriptions, opens up more research, and paves the way for Medicare/Medicaid coverage.** 

**Mid-2026 timeline seems realistic for finalization, with immediate wins like VA docs recommending in legal states.**

**\*\*Same exact afternoon, Tilray announces Tilray Medical USA—a new division focused on accelerating their U.S. medical cannabis push.** 

# That's not random timing. 

**With their global medical leadership, export track record in 20+ countries, and partnerships, they're set up to enter the U.S. the right way.** 

**The EO's focus on veteran studies and CBD fits perfectly with Tilray's Canadian vet initiatives and Manitoba Harvest hemp brand.**

**Then, just days later on December 22, Charlotte's Web (CWBHF) CEO reveals they're one of the few companies selected for the Medicare pilot offering up to $500 annual reimbursements for CBD products to seniors, kicking off April 1, 2026.** 

**This ties straight back to the EO enabling federal supportive care programs—huge for the senior wellness market.**

# The Bigger Picture: Why This All Connects for Tilray

**Look at the chain:** 

**VA import comment period clears** 

**→ Tilray announces massive capacity addition** 

**→ EO accelerates Sch III** 

**→ Tilray launches U.S. medical arm same day** 

**→ seniors CBD reimbursement program announced.** 

# It's regulatory momentum meeting perfect corporate timing.

**Add in potential Canadian excise tax relief talks for 2026 (easing that $1/gram hit would be a massive margin booster for Tilray's dominant Canadian position), and the setup gets even stronger.**

**StockLaunchers has been pointing out how medical-focused cannabis companies are best positioned for these federal shifts, especially with Medicare integration and research upside. They called Charlotte's Web a ""sleeping giant"" after the program news—and CWBHF rocketed over 300% in under a month (from around $0.10 to $0.41).**

**Tilray checks all the same boxes but on a much bigger scale: diversified across cannabis, beer (SweetWater, etc.), and hemp; cleaner balance sheet; growing revenues. They're not just CBD—they're full-spectrum medical with export muscle for VA/supply deals and Manitoba Harvest ready for any seniors wellness boost.**

# What to Expect on the January 8 Q2 Call

**The Q2 earnings call is coming up January 8.** 

**With all this fresh momentum, I'd bet Irwin addresses the EO impacts, Schedule III progress, potential for the seniors program (via Manitoba Harvest), and any VA/research angles.** 

**These are material developments—280E relief alone is a game-changer for profitability.** 

**Guidance for 2026 could get a nice bump if they hint at U.S. entry paths.**

**If CWBHF Can Jump 300% on That News, What's Tilray's Upside?**

**Charlotte's Web exploded on pure CBD/seniors program exposure.** 

**Tilray has that plus medical cannabis scale, veteran alignment, production firepower, and broader portfolio stability.** 

**Post-EO, TLRY already popped 75% briefly before pulling back to around $9-10.** 

**If the call delivers updates on partnerships, program involvement, or Sch III clarity—or if we get concrete VA import news—a similar catalyst could easily drive 200-400% from current levels ($20-40 range feels realistic on momentum).** 

**Longer term, with full U.S. traction, some are talking $50+ as institutional money flows in post-280E.**

**This feels like the stars aligning for Tilray—policy tailwinds hitting right as they're scaling and pivoting to the U.S. medical side.**

1q3ymzw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Shadowverse/comments/1q3ymzw/shadowverse_worlds_beyond_meta_report_january_4th/,Shadowverse Worlds Beyond Meta Report. January 4th,"Greetings everyone and welcome to another year and another Shadowverse Worlds Beyond Meta Report! We are off to the first week of Blossoming Fate and a lot has happened. We also got Tablet of Tribulations nerfed. So a lot has happened and likely a lot will happen. So let us take a dive into the first week of things and get a rough outlook on what has happened. Keep in mind i work with imperfect sources so i will likely miss some things and some decks as things move at a fairly rapid pace.

**Forestcraft**

*It is the dawn of a new year in the majestic woods of Forestcraft. But for Lovesign there is no respite. As soon as he is able to get the elf out of the mimic, he quickly finds himself confronted with a man hanging from a tree in dire need of help as well. Though he quickly gets the sense that the gentleman dangling from the oak might be there for a reason and decides to just not bother..*

Forestcraft finds itself to a slow start at the set, almost as usual. As the class does tend to be more complex and so takes more time to figure out the decks. That said, it is also not hard to think of the needed buffs last set. So we'll have to see what the case here is for Forestcraft.  Miroku is seeing near universal adoption unsurprisingly with a variety of other new cards seeing a fair amount of usage across a variety of decks already.

At the onset Roach remains the king of the woods, followed by Tempo Forest, Evo Forest and some Rose Queen Forest. 

**[Roach Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cCNE.cCNE.cCQM.cCQM.cCQM.cabE.cabE.cabE.cao2.cao2.cao2.capI.capI.capI.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1W.cb1g.cb1g.cb1g.cb1q.cb1q.cb1q.cb2w.cb2w.cb2w.czCO.czCO.czCO.czU-.czU-.dLvU.dLvU.dLvU.e6x8.e6x8.e6x8)**

A combo deck built around the roach. Remaining at the top of the onset of the set.  Miroku has been a pretty standard inclusion across all Roach decks with most also including World of Games. Note this build by ElitePonTakuya who has hit Ultimate with his build does not. So i figured that worth pointing out. We'll see how the deck develops over the coming weeks.

**[Tempo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.caY6.caY6.caY6.cabE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1q.cb1q.cbG-.cbG-.cbG-.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.czCO.czCO.czCO.czRs.czRs.czhU.czhU.czhU.dkJ-.dkJ-.dkJ-.e3ls.e3ls.e3ls.e6w-.e6w-.e6w-.e6x8.e6x8.e6x8)**

A tempo deck built around Faeries and running down the opponent with them.  Quickly adopting Miroku and Wolfraud. With Spirited Skipper also being a common inclusion and World of Games also crops up in a variety of builds. This particular build from Yuki instead goes for a leaner and meaner build with Monster Literatteur. So there's plenty of room for experimentation in Tempo Forest. [Also this build which has also hit Grandmaster from Glory_HS](https://x.com/glory__HS/status/2005956142120210646?s=20) playing some of the other aforementioned cards.

**[Evo Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cYb6.cYb6.cb1W.cb1W.czCO.czCO.czCO.czRs.czRs.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dLsM.dLsM.dLsM.dhLW.dhLW.dhLW.dhqc.dhqc.di4E.di4E.di4E.djnc.dkGs.dkGs.dkGs.dkJ-.dkJ-.dkWU.dkWU.dkWU.dkWe.dkWe.dkWe.e6hM.e6hM.e6x8.e6x8.e6x8)**

A midrange deck built around the Evolving.  Similar to other decks Evo Forest has been quick to adopt Miroku with Spirited Skipper also seeing consistent usage across Evo Forest decks. Flowering Friendship also sees some usage but is not quite as universally adopted across Evo Forest decks. So quite a few decks going about now as people look to figure out the most optimal build. The featured list being from Gray_Adams


**[Rose Queen Forest](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.1.cC7c.cC7c.cCNE.cCNE.cCNE.cabE.cabE.canu.canu.canu.cb1M.cb1M.cb1M.cb1W.cb1W.cb1q.cb1q.cbH8.cbH8.cbH8.cxFO.cxFO.czCO.czCO.czCO.czU-.czU-.czU-.czhU.czhU.dJfu.dJfu.dLck.dLeI.dLeI.dLeI.dM5-.dM5-.e6x8.e6x8)**

A Combo/Control deck built around Rose Queen. Still around and like other decks quick to adopt Miroku. This list from Maccha_Sv. It does overall appear for now to be a fringe deck still. But who knows how things may develop.

---

**Swordcraft**

*In the great halls of Fortress Swordcraft, where banners and elaborate tapestries cover the walls for miles. We find Sinciro in a spot of trouble as Mjerrabaine has come with the repair bill after he broke the Tablet of Tribulations after too heavy usage. And being unable to pay it. Mjerrabaine lays down some rules on the tablets usage going forwards, impacting everyone. Safe to say Sinciro got a lot of hate mail after that.  *

Heading into the new set. We see Oluon seeing a fair amount of usage in more aggressive decks with some Evolve and Loot decks running Unkei. Shield of Serenity is also fairly popular due to its flexibility and ability to flood the board with tokens for cheap.

Loot Sword has definitely been hit by the nerfs, but still remains at the lead, followed by Aggro Sword, Evo Sword and a tiny bit of Midrange Sword that has clawed its way back here in the first week of the set.

**[Loot Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cdTm.cdTm.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cxFE.cxFE.dNpM.dNpM.dNpM.dO2-.dO2-.dO4Y.dO4Y.dO4Y.dOIc.dOIc.dOIc.dOLk.dOLk.dOLk.dOYE.dOYE.dOYE.dOYO.dOYO.dOYO.dmyk.dmyk.dmyk.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.e9Ak.e9Ak.e9Ak)**

A Tempo/Burn deck built around the Usurpation archetype and various threats. With the nerf to Tablet of Tribulations the deck took a bit of a hit. That said cards like World of Games have provided the deck with some card draw to compensate for it. This combined with the deck being a known entity for 2 sets in a row is doing a lot in the first week to ensure the deck still sees a lot of play. Additionally there are numerous builds about now as people look for the most optimal now, making the deck harder to predict as some go more aggressive with [Monster Litterateur](https://x.com/Nain12119/status/2007112025982570548?s=20) while others take a slower approach. The featured build is from Kuwon_Shadowve. We shall see what the deck does over the coming weeks.

**[Aggro Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cEZs.cEZs.cEZs.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTm.cdTm.cdTm.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdWk.cdjE.cdjE.cdjE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.cxFO.cxFO.cxFO.dNpM.dNpM.dNpM.dOLk.dOLk.dOLk.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.dmyk.dmyk.dmyk.e8x6.e8x6.e8x6.e9NE.e9NE.e9NEk)**

An Aggro deck built around efficient threats and bringing down the opponent quickly. At the onset of the set Aggro Sword quickly rises up to be the second most played Sword deck. Oluon being one of the key cards helping push it forwards as he provides a tool to help push through some of the control heavier decks and provide a lot of burst damage. Monster Litterateur and Shield of Serenity are also common new inclusions. Overall though, there are a lot of variations on Aggro Sword, which gives the deck some strength as it becomes difficult to predict what it might be holding in its hand.  The featured list is by Tomomaru102 who hit beyond rank with it.


**[Evolve Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cdE8.cdE8.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdU4.cdU4.cdjO.cdjO.cdjO.cxFO.cxFO.c_uG.c_uG.d07k.d07k.d07k.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.di4E.dmj6.dmj6.dmj6.dmyk.dmyk.dmyu.dmyu.dmyu.e9NO.e9NO)**

A Midrange deck built around evolving, with Seofon being a key card for big swings. At the onset of the new deck, evolve sword finds itself falling a bit behind aggro sword. Even as it does include new cards like Unkei and occasionally shield of Serenity in some decks. It does ultimately lack more support for the evolve arm of the strategy. Which at the very least at the onset of the set does hold it back a bit. Like with other sword decks, there are plenty of variations of the build depending on what the player emphasizes. This particular build is by Royal Shadowverse who hit beyond with it


**[Midrange Sword](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.2.cdE8.cdE8.cdE8.cdEI.cdEI.cdEI.cdTw.cdTw.cdTw.cdjE.cdjE.cdjO.cdjO.cdjO.cxFO.cxFO.cxFO.d07k.d07k.d07k.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dNpM.dNpM.dNpM.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.dmyk.dmyk.dmyk.e8x6.e8x6.e8x6.e9NE.e9NE.e9NO.e9NO.e9NO)**

A Midrange deck built around efficient followers..  Making a minor return this set as the addition of cards like Unkei and Shield of Serenity provides it with just enough efficient followers to make a bit of a comeback. With a few variations going about. This one by Repriq featuring a few Oluons for board control and emergency finisher. Will be interesting to see if this deck develops further over the coming weeks.

**Runecraft**

*As both students and faculty turn up hungover at the great academies of Runecraft. We find Keith busy trying to guide the various students and teachers. When suddenly Lhynkal wandering fool gets in his way with her dog. Badgering him with all manner of questions all the while seemingly multiplying. He quickly runs off for a break after that and swears to just avoid that girl if he ever sees her again.*

Runecraft finds itself with some changes, though not in earth rite for the most part. Spellboost does see some as it is quick to include Ara and Woodsong Haikumaster. Additionally Lhynkal does find herself in her own deck.

Overall though, Earth Rite remains in the lead, followed by Spellboost Rune and Lhynkal Rune.


**[Earth Rite Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH1g.cH1g.cH1g.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfw0.cfw0.cfw0.cfwA.cfwA.cfwA.d1r6.d1r6.d1r6.d24u.d24u.d24u.d2Z-.d2Z-.d2a8.d2a8.d2a8.dJfu.dJfu.dQ-U.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.di4E.di4E.dovu.dovu.dovu.dpCU.dpCU.dpCU.dpP8.dpP8.dpP8)**

A Midrange deck built around Earth rites and evolving. Largely remaining unchanged with the exception of a few decks that might run Terraforming wizard. The deck is less popular in the metagame, but overall remains quite solid if unchanged.

**[Spellboost Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH3E.cH3E.cH3E.cHFu.cHFu.cHFu.cYOc.cfTu.cfTu.cfTu.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfy-.cfy-.cfy-.cfz8.cfz8.cfz8.cg9U.cg9U.cg9U.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cgCc.cgCc.cgCc.dpO-.dpO-.dpO-.eB7k.eB7k.eB7k.eBKO.eBKO.eBKO.eBpe.eBpe.eBpe)**

A Midrange/Combo control deck built around spellboosting and earth rites. Ara and friends quickly gives the deck a fresh and more board focused direction. Though there are still some that aim for a combo with Cocytus. Though even with some of them, it appears like a secondary strategy in case the board based on does not work. So a few variations about there. This one by normalwannagame.

**[Lhynkal Rune](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.3.cH3E.cH3E.cH3E.cfTk.cfTk.cfTk.cfTu.cfTu.cfTu.cfjM.cfjM.cfjM.cfy-.cfy-.cfy-.cg9e.cg9e.cg9e.cgCc.cgCc.cgCc.d24k.d24k.dIz-.dIz-.dJRg.dJRg.dJRg.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eB7k.eB7k.eB7k.eBKO.eBKO.eBKO.eBpU.eBpU.eBpU)**

A Combo deck built around Lhynkal. Very much a fringe deck at the onset of the game. Its overall strategy is to just get Lhynkal to bring down the max defence of the enemy to 0 by evolving her and then drawing all the Lhynkals swiftly.  Appears here and there, but not really a common deck.

---

**Dragoncraft**

*It is the new year in the great mountain of Dragoncraft, its peaks reaching into the stratosphere. And everyone is suddenly a lot nicer to Galan. Even El has toned down her jabs a bit after learning of his story and the power of his fists. Which quite frankly does please Galan a bit as it means less work for him..*

A strong set for Dragoncraft, the new cards give the class quite the boost. With both Erntz and Yube giving the class strong options. But also cards like Jellyfish Dancer and Sloth of the Crestpetal provide Dragoncraft with some flexible tools. Revitalizing the class and most if not all of its decks while also providing new ones. Additionally the Dragoncraft metagame has seen quite a bit happen. With the new Ocean Dragon deck initially leading, but now it looks like Fennie Dragon towards the end of the week is gaining momentum. So who knows what the Dragoncraft metagame may actually look like tomorrow.

For now though Storm Ramp remains at the lead, followed by Evolve Dragon, Fennie Dragon and Ocean Dragon.


**[Storm Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.cic2.cic2.cic2.cxFE.cxFE.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.dTQu.dTQu.dTQu.drrE.drrE.drrO.drrO.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eDme.eDme.eDme.eE3E.eE3E.eE3E.eEFk.eEFk.eEFk)**

A midrange deck built around ramping into big storm followers. Tentatively still the top Dragon deck as the addition of Erntz along with Jellyfish Dancer and Sloth of the Crestpetal along with World of Games really helped even out a lot of bumps of the deck. Making for a stronger performance that can handle more threats. There are several variations of this deck unsurprisingly, some run Forte, others do not. This particular build is from Tzgnzz who hit beyond with it.

**[Evo Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.dSxe.dSxe.dTQu.dTQu.dTQu.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.dhqm.dhqm.di4E.di4E.di4E.drbc.drbc.drbc.e4IE.eDme.eDme.eDme.eE3E.eE3E.eE3E.eEFk.eEFu.eEFu)**

A Midrange deck built around evolving and Ramping.  Gaining into second place for now. Evo Dragon similarly to other Dragoncraft decks has been able to make good use of the new cards, with Yube being commonly run as well. Similar to Storm Ramp, the new cards help even out a lot of the bumps. Several versions abound with this particular build by Dokurigen.

**[Fennie Ramp Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.cJl6.cJl6.cJl6.cYqk.cYqk.cYqk.ci9c.ci9c.ciM6.ciM6.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.d50O.d50O.d50O.dSxe.dSxe.dSxe.dTQu.dTQu.dTQu.dhqc.drrO.e4Uk.eDme.eDme.eDme.eE3E.eE3E.eE3E.eEFk.eEFk.eEFk)**

A combo deck built around Fennie. A bit slow to take off, the deck has seemingly been taking off with some speed after a build by Nuke appeared from my understanding, which is the one featured. And already several players appear to have hit Beyond with it. So it does appear to be a potent deck that is quickly rising in the Dragoncraft metagame. Though whether or not it sticks or hits a surprise obstacle. We shall know by next week. But one to keep an eye out for.



**[Ocean Dragon Dragon](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.4.ciMG.ciMG.ciMG.ciNg.ciNg.cibu.cibu.cxFE.d4KU.d4KU.d4KU.d4X8.d4X8.d4X8.d4mc.d4mc.d4mc.d50E.d50E.d50E.dSxe.dSxe.dSxe.dTQu.dTQu.dTQu.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.drrE.drrE.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eDme.eDme.eDme.eEFu.eEFu.eEFu)**

A Midrange deck built around the Ocean trait and Yube.  The deck started off fairly popular at the start of the week, but already by the end of it is starting to drop off as other decks overtake it rapidly. Quite the fall and rise in just one week. We shall see what happens with it over the coming weeks. Will it make a comeback ?


---

**Abysscraft**

*Within the opulent halls of the Foreboding castle Abysscraft. Cerberus is taking a nap when Belial storms into her office asking for the quarterly reanimation reports and a risk assesment on Milteo. Completely ruining the nap and also knocking over a cup of cold coffee all over her. She really should find a way to barricade the door since it has no locks for some reason..*

Abyss finds itself a bit off to a rough start as the class performs at least initially less well. Though at the same time has plenty of decks to go about as a variety of decks use a variety of new cards. So we'll have to see how things turn out over the coming weeks.

For now Midrange remains at the lead, followed by Modal, Milteo, Evo and finally Shakdoh Abyss. There's technically also still some Aggro abyss, but that appears to have largely been supplanted by Milteo abyss already. So it won't get a writeup this week.


**[Midrange Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.ckog.ckrU.cl1-.cl1-.cl1-.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zE.d6zO.d6zO.d6zO.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dVNk.dVNk.dVt8.dVt8.dVt8.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.dtYc.dtYc.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eGCk.eGCk.eGCk.eGFs.eGFs.eGFs)**

A midrange deck built around efficient followers. Quickly absorbing some of the new cards like Tyrannical fists and Fickle Necromancer along with World of Games. Midrange Abyss overall appears to remain at the top of the Abysscraft Metagame for now. Noting that Midrange abyss decks are quite varied with few looking similar. Especially amongst the 2 cost cards there is a great amount of variety. This particular build is from KT_sv who hit beyond with the deck.

**[Modal Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLxk.ckME.ckME.cl1-.cl1-.d7SU.d7SU.d7SU.dJfu.dJfu.dV86.dV86.dV86.dVNk.dVNk.dVNk.dVPI.dVPI.dVPI.dVdM.dVdM.dVdM.dVgU.dVgU.dVgU.dVs-.dVs-.dVs-.dVt8.dVt8.dVt8.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.dhqm.dhqm.dtYm.dtYm.dtoY.dtoY)**

A control deck built around modal cards. Modal has made a bit of a comeback internally this set. Even if it runs no new cards. Will be interesting to see if that remains the case or if it picks up something new down the road. But for now, it does appear to be one of the more popular abysscraft decks.

**[Milteo Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cLuw.cLuw.cLuw.cM8E.cM8E.cM8E.ckJQ.ckJQ.ckJQ.ckYu.ckYu.ckYu.ckZ2.ckZ2.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d70M.d70M.d70M.d7D0.d7D0.dtoY.dtoY.dtoY.e3ls.eGFs.eGFs.eGFs.eGh-.eGh-)**

An aggro deck built around efficient threats, burn damage and Milteo.  Taking a bit of a while to get going. But during the week people pieced together the a pretty efficient build and it has become one of the more popular abyss decks. Combining the usual aggro cards with cards like Dogged one being quite common depending on the build. Overall there appears to  be the more straightforward aggro builds, of which this weeks list is from Nyakkusu. But you also have builds more focused on out of hand damage [Like this one](https://x.com/kkkkkkkkkkoara/status/2006925089217065321?s=20) as an example [And this one from game8 splits the difference](https://shadowverse-wb.com/ja/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cM8E.cM8E.cM8E.ckZ2.ckZ2.ckZ2.ckog.ckog.ckog.ckrU.ckrU.ckrU.cl2I.cl2I.cl2I.d6jm.d6jm.d6jm.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d6zE.d6zE.d6zE.d7D0.dJQ6.dJQ6.dJQ6.e3ls.e3ls.e3ls.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eGFs.eGFs.eGFs.eGh-.eGh-.eGh-) So there seems to be a fair bit going on with the deck already and quite a few variations.

**[Evo Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.ckJ6.ckME.ckME.ckog.ckog.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d70M.d70M.d70M.d7SU.dJfu.dJfu.dVNk.dVNk.dVNk.dVPI.dVPI.dVdM.dVdM.dVt8.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.dhqm.dhqm.di4E.di4E.du1s.du1s.duHU.duHU.duHU.duHe.duHe.duHe.eGCk.eGCk.eGCk)**

A Midrange Deck built around evolving. Evo Abyss seems to have been off to a slow start with some decks not adopting any new cards at all, but by now it does appear like at least Fickle Necromancer is making some inroads, but for the most part. Evo Abyss largely remains as is since before the set release. This particular list by kurifuto_po_bo hit beyond with it. But overall Evo Abyss does not appear to be wildly popular.

**[Shakdoh Abyss](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.5.cYb6.cYb6.cYb6.ckJG.ckJG.ckYk.ckYk.ckYk.d6mk.d6mk.d6mk.d70M.d70M.d70M.dVPI.dVPI.dVPI.dVgU.dVgU.dVgU.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.di4E.di4E.dtYc.du1s.du1s.duHU.duHU.duHU.eG0E.eG0E.eG0E.eGVU.eGVU.eGVU.eGh-.eGi8.eGi8)**

A combo deck built around Shakdoh. A bit of a fringe deck at the moment as people struggle to figure out a good build of the deck. This particular build by Rigze appears to be one of the better ones and even that isn't exactly wildly popular. So more of a novelty at the moment than anything and a deck you really have to work with unless people figure out a more optimal build.

**Havencraft**

*It is a new year in the Cathedral city of Havencraft and already Aether is facing problems. As the arrival of Kukishiro who is all about Divine gambling is.. causing some problems amongst the clergy and the faithful. Galleon was unable to resolve it, so in the end. Esperanza will have to deal with it. Being Aethers ""Problemsolver"" . *

Haven dives hard into Odd haven with the upcoming set. Though other decks like Ward haven also gain a bit. So a fair bit going on here with a lot of new cards seeing usage.

Odd haven takes the lead, followed by Hybrid Ward Haven and Crest haven.

A midrange deck built around odd cost cards. Rapidly rising in the Havencraft ranks. It has become the most popular deck by far as it can generate a lot of followers once it gets going, plus can fight reasonably defensively too if need be. There are some variations with some decks cutting Wilbert or Jeanne, typically to include more odd cost cards. I have [even seen a odd storm haven deck](https://x.com/Lyru_2/status/2006714669642424333?s=20). This particular build is from Riasu_arbe

A control deck built around wards, crests and evolve . With Sofina the deck gets a bit more consistent with the plan as she can both evolve and is a ward. Tying the overall deck better together. Though as a whole it remains in the shadow of Odd Haven at the moment.


**[Crest Haven](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.6.cmmw.cmmw.cmmw.cnGK.cnGK.cnGK.cnUY.cxFO.cxFO.cxFO.d9BQ.d9BQ.d9BQ.d9iE.dJfu.dJfu.dJfu.dXaM.dXaM.dXdU.dXdU.dXdU.dXp-.dXp-.dXrY.dXrY.dY3c.dY3c.dY3c.dY5A.dY5A.dY5A.dYJO.dYJO.dYJO.dwju.e4IE.eIwA.eIwA.eIwA)**

A control deck built around Crest and attrition. Losing a bit of ground even as it does pick up Resolve of the Mistbloom and fate of the world. It is struggling to grabs peoples attention for now at the onset of the set. We shall see if things change over the coming weeks.

**Portalcraft**

*It is a new year in the Metropolis of Nova Portalcraft and Orchis is busy cleaning up the apartment with the help of Beelzebub when suddenly Dreizehn hauls in a small indigent covered in filth that she found in the streets. But thought she'd make a great friend for Zwei and Beelzebub.. once cleaned up. Beelzebub is quick to proclaim he does not need friends! but falls silent when Imari starts chatting him up. *

Imari has pretty much boosted the entire class. Her ability to draw spells (most of which are very cheap) combined with her ability to generate 3/3 rush tokens has made her very useful across a lot of decks. Effectively resurrecting Artifact Portal in the process too. No small feat for a legendary. And while other cards are seeing a good amount of usage. Imari is very much the key to Portalcraft this set.

Puppet Portal continues to lead though, followed by Destruction Portal and Artifact Portal.


**[Puppet Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.cQnG.cQnG.cQnG.cpC4.cpC4.cpRO.cpRO.cpRO.cpwU.cpwU.cpwU.cpwe.cpwe.cpwe.cxFE.cxFE.cxFE.dBcG.dBcG.dBcG.dCK-.dCK-.dCK-.dhqc.dhqc.dhqc.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eKuk.eKuk.eKuk.eL8M.eL8M.eLN-.eLN-.eLN-.eLae.eLae.eLae)**

A Tempo/Midrange deck built around puppets.  With the addition of Imari Puppet Portal has gotten stronger. As she provides tempo, but also makes the deck more consistent as she can help thin it out making you more likely to draw what you need. While there are variations, pretty much all Portal decks run Imari and her cards. This particular list is from Oebkg

**[Evo Destruction Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.cQnG.cQnG.cQnG.cxFE.cxFE.dJfu.da0c.daGE.daGE.daGE.daHo.daHo.daHo.daVs.daVs.daVs.daY-.daY-.daY-.dalU.dalU.dalU.dale.dale.dale.dzA8.dzA8.e4Gg.e4Gg.e4Gg.eKrm.eKuk.eKuk.eKuk.eLN-.eLN-.eLN-.eLae.eLae.eLae)**

A midrange deck built around Destruction. Similar to Puppet Portal. Imari provides more consistency to the deck while also providing board control. Also giving Destruction portal quite a boost. An interesting inclusion though is some decks running a copy of Flowering artisan for a bit of extra spell synergy for board control. Some variations about. With this list from _ekucha_


**[Artifact Portal](https://shadowverse-wb.com/en/deck/detail/?hash=2.7.cpEu.cpEu.cpEu.cpUM.cpUM.cpUM.cpUW.cphK.cphK.cphK.cpwo.cpwo.cpwo.dBdg.dBdg.dBdg.dBus.dBus.dBus.dCL8.dhqm.dhqm.dhqm.dyRQ.dyRQ.dyRQ.dywM.dywM.dywM.eL5E.eL5E.eL8M.eL8M.eL8M.eLN-.eLN-.eLN-.eLae.eLae.eLae)**

A Midrange deck built around Artifacts. Rising up against thanks to Imari who similar to other decks. Helps make it more consistent and provides a solid defensive option. Cards like New Age Cartographer also help out. But aren't quite as Key as Imari and her spells. This list is by tarakokkkko who hit grandmaster with it

So there you have it. Bit of a shakeup in the first set with Portal and Dragon stepping up and several new decks popping up as well. And that is just in the first week. And we've got Aggro, Midrange, Control and Combo decks all seeing a fair amount of play. The only area where i might raise some concern is that Forest and Abyss see notably less play than the other classes, but hopefully that solves itself over the coming weeks or the developers step in to buff them.

Also as a Shadowverse Veteran. World of Games does raise an eyebrow as it reminds me of Staircase to Paradise which they ended up having to nerf. And i can't help but suspect we might see that happen here as well as they are very similar. But i could very well be worrying about nothing. 

Also my apologies for any mistakes or decks i missed. A lot to keep track of, plus i did not sleep too well last night.

So until next week. Have fun playing Shadowverse!",34,1767553977.0,Shadowverse,9,1.0,False

I’ve been tossing around a local business idea in Saint John and wanted to see if there’s any interest here before taking it further.

I personally love trying different hobbies (crochet/knitting, different types of painting, candle making, embroidery, sewing, etc) but I’ve found that it can get really expensive and space-consuming to buy all the supplies, especially if you’re not even sure you’ll stick with the hobby long-term.

I’ve been wondering if Saint John would be interested in a cozy creative space where people could come in, use provided supplies, and work on different crafts or hobbies without having to buy everything themselves. Kind of a low-pressure place to try new hobbies, relax, and be creative — maybe even with a coffee or snack. This could also be fun for date nights, birthdays, or just a chill evening out that isn’t a bar.

I’m not selling anything right now, but I’m just genuinely curious:

- Is this something you would be interested in?
- What kinds of crafts or hobbies would you want to try?

1q3yinm,https://www.reddit.com/r/ConnectBetter/comments/1q3yinm/socially_awkward_but_craving_connection_heres_the/,Socially awkward but craving connection? Here's the friendship playbook that actually works,"It’s wild how many people feel lonely today—even in a world that’s so hyperconnected. You’d think with all the apps, groups, and digital platforms, making friends would be easy. But nope. So many are still stuck in their heads, socially anxious, avoiding eye contact at parties and overthinking every word in group chats. Social awkwardness isn’t rare—it’s just rarely talked about.

This post is a walk through real, research-backed ways to make friends when you’re not the smoothest in social settings. Pulled from behavioral science books, psychology research, and really smart people on podcasts like Andrew Huberman and authors like Vanessa Van Edwards. No fluff, just things that work.

**1. Use the “mere exposure effect” to your advantage**

You don’t have to be funny or charismatic to make friends. You just need to *show up* consistently. A classic study by psychologist Robert Zajonc showed that people tend to like others more simply because they see them often. Go to the same café, class, or gym. You’ll build familiarity, which often leads to friendships—even without deep convos at first.

**2. Learn the art of “social bids”**

Psychologist John Gottman calls these micro-attempts to connect “bids.” A bid can be a comment, a question, even just a shared laugh. The trick isn’t to be perfect, it’s to *make* them. Ask someone how their weekend was. Point out the weird playlist at the coffee shop. Over time, people respond to consistent, low-stakes engagement. Small talk isn’t useless. It’s the on-ramp.

**3. Join structured, recurring groups—not open mixers**

Structured interactions make things WAY easier for socially awkward brains. A 2023 MIT Sloan study found that people build deeper connections in recurring, goal-oriented activities (like book clubs, running groups, language classes) compared to unstructured social events. You’ll skip the anxiety of “what do I say,” because the shared task does the heavy lifting.

**4. Use the “Ben Franklin Effect”**

Instead of doing favors *for* others, ask *them* for something small—like a book recommendation or podcast rec. This request makes people more likely to like you, not less. It creates investment. Franklin used it to win over political rivals. Humans like people they help. Try it.

**5. Let people see your quirks early**

A study published in *Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin* found that people who reveal small vulnerabilities early (like “I always forget names—sorry if I do that later”) are more likable. It humanizes you. You don’t need to pretend to be confident. You just need to be a little honest.

Every awkward person thinks they need to become more extroverted to make friends. That’s not true. You just need to be consistent, curious, and a bit brave with the small stuff.",2,1767553711.0,ConnectBetter,0,1.0,False

We got home at 10pm to find the furnace had run out of oil on an 11° F (-11°C) night. This required a mad dash to town 15 miles away to buy diesel fuel. Then me standing outside in the wind pouring 5 gallon jugs of diesel into the standpipe that feeds the tank. 

Saturday morning I realized my parents hadn’t completely turned off the water valve to the washing machine and it froze, bursting a pipe In it, and flooded the laundry. The laundry floor is now a 6 inch think block of Ice. 

These are the symptoms of the things I’ve single mindedly ignored for the past year so that I could focus on getting through surgery. My parents, who live with me in my house, are in their 80s and neither are doing great.  They act like they have it together but then I find that all of the winterization  projects they said they did before leaving for two weeks were incomplete.

It’s all hitting me today as I stop to get a coffee on my way to buy more diesel at the gas station. Emergency oil deliver comes Monday or Tuesday.

Despite all the best plans, disability insurance, and help from friends, it’s going to be a very tight next couple of months as my finances recover from being out of work. I start work tomorrow, Monday. As much as I’ve loved being out of work I’m ready to go back, and I need that paycheck. My recovery from surgery was hard. It only felt more like a vacation for the last three weeks and I still couldn’t possible have kept up with dilation 3 times a day if I had returned earlier. 

What I’m grateful for despite this tale of woe is that I’m doing it as my authentic self. I’m here, emotionally vulnerable, beautiful, intentional, and with more capacity to face the future than I’ve had in over a decade. I danced in the new year with hope in my heart and possibilities on the horizon with new trans and cis friends.

1. On the way to paravani lake. I stopped at a cold store to drink coffee and I had to pee really bad. And the cashier said I could use the washroom (just to clarify I’m a girl) went into the store didn’t find the washroom, asked one of the ladies organizing the stocks “where is the toilet” and she yelled saying “NONONO ara toilet. When clearly I saw a toilet there afterwards. She went and told the cashier something and he also went like “NO NO”.

Do I not have the basic right to pee In a closed toilet now? I can’t believe people stoop soo low. Now if I proceed to pee in the public’, they’ll be like ewww this is why other nationalities are dirty. Mf  we are not dirty. It’s you who is dirty in your thoughts and your actions. Now if I don’t get to pee in a toilet am I supposed  to die with a full bladder? 

2. Even the universities and hospitals Here in Georgia lock their washrooms! LOCK! Are you fr? You’re a friking hospital. Wdym I’ll lock the washroom soo nobody pees.

1q3ya5v,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1q3ya5v/brian_the_isekai_chapter_22_leaning_to_enchant/,Brian The Isekai: Chapter 22 Leaning to Enchant,"The beginner’s enchanting book looked like it had been written for children. Big letters, simple diagrams, and more warnings than a power tool manual.  
 “Do not inhale magic dust.”  
 “Do not enchant in enclosed spaces.”  
 “Do not set your clothes on fire.”  
 Yeah, good advice. Shame it came after the battle.

The first lesson was simple enough: make a fire rune. According to the book, all I needed was a stable material, carving tools, and a pinch of magic core dust. Easy.

“Hey, Tolin, can you get me some magic core dust and some carving tools?” I asked, excited.

He left my room and told someone to handle it. After a couple of hours they came back with what I needed to get started.

I took a large rib bone from this morning and started carving into it. It was a simple rune, like the fire symbol you would see on warning signs back on Earth.

What was strange was I wasn’t exactly carving the same lines I saw. It was different but my hands moved by themselves, like something was guiding them and was kinda freaking me out. 

When I completed the carving, I started on the next instructions. I packed the rune with crushed magic core dust. It shimmered faintly, like powdered glass under lamplight.

The book said I needed to visualize the rune and flame and cast the spell fire. I placed my hand on the bone with a finger on one line as instructed. Then I visualized the simple rune and fire coming from it. Then I said the spell, “Fire,” with my voice making that weird sound.

Nothing happened. I tried again, over and over, but nothing happened except my voice starting to hurt. I opened the book, read it again, and saw the missing ingredient. Actually having mana. Damn it. How was I going to enchant without mana?

I decided to read more, which was me skipping around the book looking for something, when I finally found that if you are low on mana you can use a charged gem to supplement your mana for rune casting.

Maybe I just needed a charged gem and then I could enchant. I asked Tolin if he could get me a charged gem. He said he could, but only after I did my time in the Adventurer’s Guild. I didn’t want to go, but the faster I got those classes done, the faster I could learn magic.

Tolin and I headed to the Adventurer’s Guild and I began learning more about the different animals in the forest. It was hard to pay attention until combat training started and I got my face beat with a wooden mace. Glad they had the healer, who took extra time with me but didn’t quite get rid of the bruises.

Once that was done, I went back. I rushed up the stairs to see if the gem was already there and it was sitting on my desk, but all the magic core dust was gone. Tolin followed behind me and noticed it too. He started walking fast back downstairs. His hands rested on the hilts of his daggers.

“Alright, who went into Brian’s room?” said Tolin in an authoritative voice.

“I had to drop off the gem,” said an orc.

Tolin walked up to him and checked his eyes for a tell.

“Who else went into Brian’s room?” Tolin asked again.

He scanned the room, looking at everyone. He settled on a halfling on the couch who was breathing heavier than the rest of us. Tolin walked up to him and asked, “You went into Brian’s room and took the core dust, didn’t you?”

“It’s not like we can’t get more. I thought he was done with it,” said the halfling.

Tolin pulled out his dagger lightning fast and started stabbing the halfling in the face multiple times. Blood and bone flew from the now faceless halfling. The body dropped to the ground with a small thud and blood started pooling on the wooden floors.

Then Tolin flipped him over and cut into his chest. More blood pooled and flowed through the tiny cracks between the floorboards. With one deep cut he reached in and pulled out an uncut, unfinished magic core from the halfling’s chest. He walked over and handed me the blood-covered magic core.

“Hope this helps you out. Now, anyone going into Brian’s room other than me will have their magic cores donated to the Broken Crown. If anyone hurts Brian, they will become the next battery. Do you understand?” said Tolin.

Everyone in the room nodded, including me.

“Now you, orc. I can see you made a genuine mistake, and that happens once in a while. Learn and don’t do it again. Now clean this up,” said Tolin.

I realized I didn’t even see the knife leave his sheath, just a blur of gore. That had to be a skill and one I did not want to be on the receiving end of. I made my way back to my room holding the bloodied magic core. It had a faint pulse of magic in it. As I held it, I felt a tingle going into my arm. Then I decided to clean it off along with my hands. I got my wish for a magic core. Yay.

Moments later Tolin joined me and I told him I had no idea how to refine this into dust. He sent someone to get more.

By the time I got more dust, I broke out of my shock. I shouldn’t have been surprised. I’m in the mafia now, the Broken Crown. I had someone in the house fill the gem. I think it was a topaz. I didn’t really pay attention to gems on Earth. Once filled, I read in the book that I would also need to visualize the mana in the gem going into the rune and making the fire.

I put my hand on a line I carved on the bone and began. I did my visualization and said the spell, “Fire.” The line flared, a small jet of orange light rising from the groove along with some heat. The dust was gone, but now a glowing rune with a little fire above it. The heat faded as quickly as it came. The book said the rune would only work as long as it had mana in its lines, and I forgot to keep visualizing once I saw the flame.

I made a lighter out of a rib bone. I tried again, but this time I just visualized the mana from the gem to the rune, and it glowed again, making a new flame. Then it sputtered out despite me still picturing the mana flowing. The gem no longer had mana and my hand was starting to get numb.

Well, it’s official, I can do magic. I was so happy that I wanted to celebrate, but what I really wanted was to keep learning. I continued to read. Apparently, that step took beginners years. No wonder the Enchanters Guild searches for people with visualization. Most sucked that badly at it.

Over the next few days I learned more about enchanting while keeping up my lessons at the Adventurer’s Guild.

I read about how carving affected the runes. If you mess up your lines or don’t smooth them out, the mana can hit those bumps and jump the rune, doing weird things. Things like explosions have happened from that on more complicated runes. How deep you carve your runes affects how much mana can be put into the rune. If I carved mine deeper, I would have a bigger flame that took more mana.

I thought about Thrain’s forge. His runes were carved pretty deep to make that much heat. He also had dragon bone for his material. Some of the best stuff to make runes with were certain woods, bone, leather, claws, teeth, most things organic. Why wood was rated higher than bone or leather, I don’t know. They also said that most inorganic matter does not hold runes and has, on several occasions, exploded.

Another force that affected runes was what magic core dust you used. The higher the grade, the more efficient the mana transfer. The book didn’t go over how that was determined or what sets magic cores apart. It was a beginner’s guide. It did cover some basic runes like fire, water, and stone shape.

It’s been one hell of a week. By Monday, I got my first assignment from Mireth. It was to figure out why kids at daycares were getting city sickness so quickly recently. It was affecting the parents who worked for Mireth. This was a no-brainer to me. Tolin showed me where the daycares were and all I did was follow the water supply.

It seemed the people who maintained the city would replace pipes from the middle class and use the old pipes in the poor district, since they were short-handed after the battle. I sent her a note explaining how city sickness was really just lead poisoning and that if they replaced the pipes with copper the city would be much healthier.

She didn’t like that answer, since it would cost a lot of money, so instead of replacing the pipes they made a smaller separate system for the daycares. Only time would tell, and a couple of months was needed. I really wondered how everyone in the city wasn’t retarded or dead. Which reminded me that before I left the city I would get extra healed.

Between going to the daycares and Adventurer’s Guild training, a whole week went by.

This week’s assignment was trying to figure out how to make my shelves be built faster. I remembered how machines used rollers to flatten and shape steel with different bends. I also remembered some machines would just stamp out the holes. We were using wrought iron, not steel, so it should be easier.

I drew diagrams on how it should work for some of the shelves. Others I just didn’t know. I’m pretty sure I overdid the stamp machine, but better it works than not. For the roller, I couldn’t think of how exactly each roller would go and instead settled on one adjustable roller that flattened ingots into the needed sheets.

The whole design took about two days with many sketches. Since that was done, it was finally time to practice more enchanting. I got more tools and low-quality bones. I whittled myself a lighter and carved the fire rune on the outside, experimenting. I wanted to see if runes had to sit flat or could be curved.

I also learned that you can place a line where the fire could go instead of just above the rune. I’d seen it on other runes, but reading about it made it solid in my mind. I could keep my hand on the lighter and carve a line to the top for the flame to come out instead of it just burning my hand.

Something I didn’t realize was how hard it was to keep the dust in while visualizing. I ended up using some paper to help keep it sealed in. Once I had my gem charged, I visualized the mana, the rune, and the intended effect. Then I spoke the spell, “Fire,” and the paper caught on fire, burning my hand and breaking my concentration.

That got a laugh out of Tolin. The burn was a good one and they got me a balm. That taught me that using flammable things with a rune was a bad idea. The next time I tried wood, which still burned but didn’t burn me. Now I had a lighter I couldn’t really use since I had no mana, so I gave it to Tolin. What I needed to figure out was how to add gems and magic cores. That would probably solve my problem. I was also draining the gem I had quickly.

I started the stone shape rune. This one was different, since it used visualization and intention every time the rune was activated. The instructions told me to place a stone in the middle of the rune and visualize what I wanted to shape it into. I didn’t carve the rune very large and used a stone the size of common gravel on Earth. I completed the rune with magic core dust and then tried to shape a stone in the center of it. I pictured a simple square and it formed.

Then a ball. Then I wanted to push it. I pictured Tolin with as much detail as I could. It formed into a humanoid shape and then the mana ran out. After taking everyone’s mana in the house, I finally completed a tiny statue of Tolin. This mana problem was already a limit to my learning.

Tolin could use the lighter with no problem to his mana. Was channeling mana through a gem that much more costly? After that I paused enchanting and did more drawing. I wanted to finish my ass-kissing project for Mireth.

Monday came around. The new assignment was to look at a transportation wagon and see if there was anything I could improve. I was excited for this one. I had seen the wagons but never really got a good look. I could go in depth with them and see what runes were on them.

Tolin led me to the Transport Guild’s building. It was like the rest, a giant stone block with some vents. There were four different entrances. First was a pair of wooden double doors for customers. Next was an iron door meant for guild members to go in, another to go out, and a giant wood-and-iron reinforced gate to allow wagons and beasts larger than a drayhorn into or out of it.

We entered where the Transport Guild members were going. There were multiple windows helping many people. Inside were many more doors leading to different places depending on where you were going. Tolin approached the window with a sign of a wagon on it.

It didn’t take long before he reached the front. Tolin offered what looked like a guild card and we were waved through. Beyond the doors was a hallway that led to a much larger room containing different wagons and carriages. Each had its own bay and setup for maintenance. Some had spare parts lying around, others were locked up in chests and behind gates.

It seemed to me that you were responsible for your wagon and the guild gave you a lot of freedom with that. Most wagons looked the same, but a few had larger wheels or room for a second drayhorn. Others were longer with more wheels. Some didn’t even have a cover. Then there were ones meant for some sorta battle. Mounted ballistas, seats facing outward, racks for arrows. I could see where two men would turn the ballista. Not much range, but a little is better than none.

We came up to our wagon. It looked like a standard wagon but less. It had the standard six seats with storage at the front and a place for a driver to sit. This time I got to take a closer look.

“Alright, Lady Mireth said to take a look at the wagon to see if there is anything that could be made better,” said Tolin. “She would like it if you could make them go faster or quieter. I don’t think you’re going to improve it, personally, but take a look anyway.”

I started toward the wagon.

“I don’t think you’re going to improve it personally, blah blah blah,” I mimicked. “Oooh, I’m so fast with my daggers and wear black clothes. Oooh, I—”

Tolin hit the back of my kneecap and made me fall.

“Well, looks like I will start with the under part of it,” I grunted, grabbing my leg. Moments later, after my leg felt a little better, I crawled under the wagon. It sat high, which made it easy for my size.

Underneath, it seemed like the most basic setup. Just a wooden axle reinforced with iron. No suspension. The wood didn’t look common, though. Better stuff. I saw rune lines going from the center of the axle to the wheels. I followed them to find a rune of freezing.

Both axles had a freezing rune for each wheel. When my knee felt better, I climbed into the wagon and looked around. I could see the seat where the mage would sit had a little rope. I pulled it and revealed a gem and many different magic cores connected to the back axle’s freezing runes.

“Hey, Tolin, why do they need freezing runes on the wheel axles?” I asked.

“When they have to run fast for a while, the wheels heat up and catch on fire if they don’t freeze them,” said Tolin.

“Well, if you could improve one thing, what would it be?” I asked.

“The seats are too hard,” said Tolin.

He wasn’t going to be much help.

I looked around more. The storage area wasn’t much on this one, but there was another small rope that revealed another gem and magic cores. Thinking back on what Thrain said about socketing a magic core costing a lot of money, this wagon had at least ten and two gems from what I saw. The driver’s seat had something like leather suspension, just stacked leather. There was room for two to drive.

I also saw something like a moose antler with a gem and magic core, one on each side up high. Rune Light:Bright. Spotlights, maybe.

Outside, each wheel had a rune of hardening with two magic cores feeding it. The wheels had iron bands with small bone plates around them, but no rune on those. At least they had bronze on the wheel and axle. Those could be changed out after wear, which I suspected was a lot.

Was that it? This is what they traveled the forest with? No real suspension and just a couple of runes? I searched more. Disappointed. They had magic and they had freezing for axles and hardening for wheels. I really wondered what the rich used.

There were things I could make better. Suspension, but with wrought iron it wouldn’t hold up long before it deformed. Even with my idea for a power hammer, I knew I would have to change those springs out. If I had steel, then I could really give these wagons proper suspension.

Something I wanted was bearings. That would change a lot. I wasn’t going to give the best design I could think of, but simple roller bearings would be better than bronze on bronze. Hell, I remembered the first bearings were made of wood. Next would be grease.

My first thought on grease was animal fat or something like olive oil. No idea how well they’d work, but still better than nothing. I was no grease expert. If they could get the freeze rune to work on the bearings, then you wouldn’t need to worry much about overheating.

If my thoughts were right, they would only need slight modification on the wheel hub. If my enchanting knowledge was correct, it would be easy to route the freezing rune to the bearing.

“Hey, is there anyone I can ask who’s a driver and what they want?” I asked.

“Later. For now, let’s get going. I don’t like staying at guilds for too long,” said Tolin.

We walked out the one-way exit. I wish I could have seen a Transport Guild drayhorn up close. Maybe next time. We walked back to the house and I started designing a bearing.

I remembered the basics. There was an outer and inner ring, something to keep the bearings separated, a groove for the rollers to ride on, and something to keep crap out. I began designing and quickly realized how much I didn’t know.

One problem was how to keep the rollers separated. I remembered they used a band of metal between them, but wouldn’t the rollers hit it? Screw it. Let them. Next was the groove. Now that I’ve been blacksmithing, I know metals expand and contract. I would leave room for heat expansion.

I had no idea how they made the seal to keep things out. Instead of figuring that out, I designed the wheel to seal itself, sort of. I wrote a note to figure out sealing and the right grease. I also wrote that they had to be pressed together so they wouldn’t fall out.

I hoped this would work. I wanted bearings for the future and hoped they could fill in my knowledge gaps. I also thought about what more I could get from this mafia. One thing that could really help me was a spell list. My isekai power allowed me to read runes, but now that I knew enchanting required speaking the actual spell, it was essential I learn more of them.

I tried an experiment. Could I write a rune I had seen before? I grabbed a slab of wood and a charcoal pencil. I remembered the orc before the battle against the forest elves. He had a lightning rune on his axe. I tried to picture the rune, and my hand started moving, drawing the symbol. I stopped thinking about it and my hand stopped. I thought again and my hand continued where it left off. Freaky.

What was controlling my hand to this extent? When I write, my hand sometimes writes something other than English, and sometimes I go longer than intended, but this was full autopilot. Next experiment. What if I thought of a rune I haven’t seen? I tried Heal. I heard the spell before but not the rune. I thought about healing and the sound the spell made. I even said the spell out loud. Nothing.

It seemed whatever this power was, I needed to build a catalog. I wondered if I also had to build a catalog for language. Less interested in that. I tried saying the spell lightning. Nothing happened, not even the voice change. It seems I can’t learn spells through seeing runes. I learned something new about myself.

Now, I knew what I wanted. I wanted a big book of spells and runes. If I could get those and figure out the rest of Enchanting, my isekai power would let me do any magic I wanted. I could live comfortably with modern-ish appliances. A refrigerator, microwave, stove, and coffee machine. I might be stretching that last one, but a man can dream.

Before I sent my bearing design, I also asked for the book of spells and runes. I had spent most of the day trying to design the bearing and still had to finish some examples. Time to sleep.

The next day, I finished the bearing designs and sent them off. Now, I could practice the water rune. Water sounded fun, so I followed the book. I took a bone, carved it, dusted it, visualized water flowing from it, and said “water” in that weird voice. The rune took hold. Instead of wasting a lot of my mana reactivating the rune myself, I tried to get Tolin to do it, but instead he said “I prefer to live.”

I got someone downstairs to activate it and it started giving off water drops. This gave me two thoughts. Was the water pure, and could someone’s mana produce enough water to keep a person hydrated? I gave the gnome activating the rune a barrel to drain the water into. I told him to push most of his mana into it.

After about an hour of slow dripping, the barrel was filling up. He said he still had mana. This confirmed that if everyone had a water rune in their house, they wouldn’t have to fetch water as much. I had no way of testing purity, but it looked clean. Maybe you miss minerals, but drinking distilled every once in a while wouldn’t kill you.

Hell, now that I can create water in abundance, couldn’t I just make a giant tank and use a water rune on it to fill it? My mind started racing with ideas. Several water wheels below the tower powering what I needed. How much potential was in mana? I was not a math magician or rocket surgeon, so I will figure that out later, but there was a lot of potential with just a water rune.

Now that I completed the book, there wasn’t much to do other than draw and finish my Adventurer’s Guild classes. So I spent the rest of the week doing just that.

Let's brighten up our winter by trying new things and having an **adventure of flavors!**

**What are the spending limits?**

We all get a little spendy around the holidays, so this swap is designed to be fun, exciting, AND easy on your wallet! You will choose whether you want one, two, or three partners. **You must spend** **at least $8, but no more than $12 per partner. This does NOT include shipping costs of any kind.** If you are creative with your spending, you may be able to share several flavors with this budget! For example, I may spend most of my budget on a small bag of great local coffee to send, but I can also share a few of my favorite tea bags that I already have in my cupboard. **Please see etiquette below!**

\*\*Swap Etiquette to Follow:\*\*​

* You **must** include at least **three** different beverages in each swap box. This can be any combination of tea, coffee, and cocoa, but should fit with any dietary restrictions and preferences communicated by your partner(s).
* Items must be sealed from the manufacturer. Individual tea bags are okay, but **they must be like this:**
* If you are sending loose-leaf tea, make sure to include some way to brew it (a tea ball, reusable tea bag, empty disposable tea bags, etc.)
* All coffee should be pre-ground. Not all members own or have access to a coffee grinder.
* You are allowed **up to 3 swap partners.**
* Extras are **not** a requirement for this swap. Any small extras (stickers, bookmarks, artwork, etc.) sent are to be solely at the sender's discretion and are not included in the budget for the swap.
* All items **must be wrapped**. *Think about it... how FUN is it to unwrap gifts?*
* Remember to **include a card** and let your partner know who you are.
* **Tracking (domestic) or receipt of sending (international)** **is required!** This way if something is lost it doesn't count against you, but it will be the post office's fault.
* If shipping international please mark as **GIFT** on the customs form so your partner is hopefully less likely to have to pay duties/taxes on the package. When recording values please do not overestimate for those who have to pay customs fees. If you are mailing internationally and would like to know your recipient's preferences for shipping, please ask us to ask them for you.
* We do not recommend shipping internationally from the USA using services other than **USPS** at this time due to high brokerage and customs fees.
* Be sure to **package your swap box(es)** for a safe secure delivery! This means using a sturdy box (NOT a mailer envelope), packing tape, and filling all empty space in the box with packing material (packing peanuts / bubble wrap / etc) so that no part of the box collapses in transit. **Expect the absolutely worst to happen to your package in transit.** Make sure your labels are clear and legible.

**Important Steps**

1. Send your **tracking number** and/or proof of postage to the swap host by **January 25th, 2025.**
2. Once you've received your boxes, you [**must post a thank you brag in the Show n Tell thread.**](https://www.mlptp.net/index.php?threads/cozy-winter-sippin-swap-brag-thread.123549/) Your sender is anxiously waiting to know how much you love your box, and everyone else would love to see what you received! Failure to complete this step will result in a neutral feedback for the swap. **Please try to include at least one photo** that shows everything you received all together, with however many other photos/comments you want. You **must also leave feedback** for each swap partner you receive a package from.
3. The mods here at the MLPTP are very busy and will quickly be moving along to the next swap, game, contest, or other activity. Please **open your boxes and complete step #2 above by** **February 8th, 2025**. Failure to do so means that the mods may not be able to step in and help with any concerns you may have with your swap box after that time has passed. *(Exceptions apply if your box arrives after this date due to extenuating circumstances).*
4. If you have any questions or concerns with ANYTHING you MUST **contact the swap host ASAP**. We will always work together to come to a fair and decisive conclusion. You are welcome to send the host photos of your swap box contents if you have any concerns you may be missing the mark, and we would be happy to provide feedback.

**The Importance of the Deadlines Listed Below**  
**and the Importance of Communication**

Everyone who signs up and sends package(s) should be able to also receive package(s) in a timely manner. If you are not confident you can have your package(s) shipped by the deadline, please **reconsider** joining. There will be plenty of other fun festivities to participate in year-round. We understand things arise and some things can't be controlled, that's okay but we also want everyone who participates to enjoy the swap and be assured to have their gifts in a timely fashion.

If for any reason you run into issues **you must communicate** with the swap host so we can work it out. Failure to ship by the required deadline or communicate issues in a timely manner may result in a negative feedback. Our goal is to make sure our swaps are fair and fun for all who participate.

\*\*You must PM the swap host when:\*\*​

* You have any questions
* You want to sign up
* You mail your package (you must include **tracking info**)
* You receive your goodies
* Whenever there are any issues or delays

I will be moving abroad for an internship in a pretty specific field, and I'm hoping I can find employment there after I'm done. 

My aunt has given me the contact of the daughter of a personal friend of hers, who works in the same field, telling me I should contact her and seek advice. 

I do believe it would be an amazing opportunity, since this woman has 15+ years of experience, but I don't know how to approach her. Should I say ""I got your contact from my aunt, who is friends with your mother""? Is that okay? Or is there a more professional way of putting it? 

While we're at it, should I invite her for coffee? Since this woman is much older than I am, I'm not sure what is the best way to get advice from her. 

Thank you all for the advice! ",1,1767553137.0,careerguidance,2,0.67,False

Hoping for some feedback on this

I’m a GP for a fund that cannot use depreciation without recapture risk. However, I do qualify for REPs as a result

The goal is to buy a high depreciation NNN asset personally to offset income. I don’t have enough capital, or income to offset, to do the traditional 7/11 gas station + c store for depreciation losses

However, my CPA recommended something I haven’t heard of at all: using the new modular coffee shops for it 

It looks like Dutch bros, 7-brew, and even some caribou coffees are all modular. 

My CPA is claiming that if we get a fee simple ownership:
-everything modular is bonusable
-the land value is negligible since they are small site 
-we could get close to 100% of purchase price as year 1 bonus 

This felt like “too good to be true” because they trade at half the price of a 7/11

My hunch is drawbacks are:
-no CTL debt (unless Dutch)
-7 brew would be franchisee instead of corporate

Am I missing something or are these fantastic depreciation bombs? ",2,1767553021.0,CommercialRealEstate,6,1.0,False

Received a call shortly after from the supervisor that I was expected to show up at that unit at 10:30 promptly as the RN that the other RN was relieved was working a 16hr.

I arrived at 10:30 as asked, the RN that I was relieving was running around like a chicken with her head cut off, trying to pass her overdue meds. No one is moving to help her of course as this is THAT unit. Additionally half her assignment is unstable and has urgent needs. I get the cliff notes report and immediately move to start stablizing this patients.

Manager on this unit is a known whack-a-doodle that I don't get along with. So of course if I'm going to putting out physical fires all night least I can do is drop the management friendly mask tonight!

""Yes sir, we are busy and short staffed.""

""Do you like nursing?""

""Not really tonight but most of the time.""

""This machine has been beeping for an hour and no one came.""

""Please use your call bell in the future so we're aware of the situation and someone can come help you.""

""I thought you would be able to hear it out there.""

""No, this is a big unit and I've been stuck in rooms.""

""No, all my other patients are unstable. But you don't have much longer 'til breakfast.""

1q3y6o5,https://www.reddit.com/r/writingcritiques/comments/1q3y6o5/this_is_the_first_chapter_of_a_short_story_i_was/,This is the first chapter of a short story I was working on. I hadn't written in a while and I just want an honest critique.,"A slight flick followed by the soft glow of a cigar bud that lights up a room.

“Ugh, where’s the fresh stuff,” a groan in between the shuffling of drawers and the ruffle of what is in them.

“I can’t see for the love of…,” the man continues as he lunges toward the light switch.

A bright white light that accompanies the grating hum of the fluorescent bulb suddenly engulfs the room. Rapid blinking and a vigorous rub of the eyes aid the man to get in rhythm with the light waves. A leather cigar case lays bare on the concrete floor, opened up with two cigars beside. It is a crime scene. He picks it and beats it up, a cleaning gesture. After, he grabs the two cigars and does the same placing only one in it. The man realizes there is another fugitive, the lighter, he swears he had it in his hands. With the cigar in his mouth, he scuffles his pockets. There and then, he notices the brown stain on his suit pants and sighs. That makes him notice the crumpled, untucked shirt and the muddy shoes and now his head starts hurting. Is it late or is it early? The apparent lack of watches in his office annoys him even more. He lets out one final grunting sigh and places the cigar back in the case.

As he motions towards the window hoping to tell the time with his eyes, he steps on a document on the floor, which propels his foot forward almost making him lose his balance. Unfortunately, that action was the initiator of a set of actions that inevitably leads to his desk upside the floor and the contents on top of it sprawled across the floor. The door, which stands to the right of his workstation, is also blocked. He could feel the inside of his head hammering now but feigns it, trying as much as possible to keep his composure. The mess is huge but he is beat, so he gives in to the unavoidable machinations of chance and seeks to complete the small task that at this point seems to get more and more irrelevant. With a bit more force than he has to he drags the window blinds, deforming them a little. A distraught visage meets him and takes him aback but how can a man not know his on face? A droopy face, bags under the eyes and his stiff hair is leaning to the left more. He tries to check on his face. Something had bit him yesterday and he had a massive pimple on his forehead, but he cannot see well because of his dark complexion. It is dark outside as the only thing appearing on that window is he.

 

With a violent tug at the tie that squeezed his neck like a python on a deer, he flings it across the floor. His shirt gets loose and his shirtsleeves scale his elbows, motivation has gripped him by his loins and unrelenting determination rushes him. He breathes deep, his eyes widen, a great show to stand a desk. Its weight is a spokesperson to the light beige, akin to milk drizzled into a coffee mug, quality, both in visuals and strength. His knees kiss the concrete, head down as a man does in prayer while his hands work the shift. The scattered papers move in collective motion gathering at the center of clasping hands. The shambling of the papers clashes with the fluorescent’s hum. It is no melody just noise. He stops and now the clanging in his head is like the beating of traditional drums, quick unwavering beats that seem to climb higher and higher. The light is making it worse, making his vision pulsate. His eyes throb and it matches the thumping in his chest. It is as if a steam locomotive is coming to a halt, he listens and looks down trying to shadow his eyes from the light.

He stacks the documents neatly, lightly shuffling them. It has been long since he played poker, he wonders if he still has enough for a wager. However, he quickly realizes he has never been afforded time to wander in his thoughts especially at this point in his life. He heaves and a light thud seals the final play in this ordeal.

His chair gives him an inviting glance. The leather has a warm patina with fissures exposing a bit of the fabric beneath. It has coddled him over the years grooving the shape of his back and his butt on the seat and the incline. It has witnessed chaos, disorder and recluse but has also been a watcher of passion and unbridled success. As silent as an object should be but the cracks in the leather, like veins erupting on the surface of the skin, each, serve as a checkpoint to the whispers and the saunter of power. Even now without hate or malice, it has nestled him to a quiet sleep. He takes his coat of the incline and wonders if the night will be cold or if he should leave his coat.

It is almost 35 years now but the cold still bites his neck like a lion to its prey, yet, he no longer shivers he accepts. Pitch black has swallowed the earth. He cannot even see his own feet. Using his memory, an old man’s memory, has been the only way to walk at night. He ambles along the beaten path to the parking lot mumbling expletives. It is the only way to avoid the paranoia, who knows what lurks where eyes do not see. The cold and the dark have calmed his head and now he thinks of another person walking beside or behind, hearing a voice mumble in the dark and he stops. It is now a quiet walk as the mud soften his steps.",1,1767552985.0,writingcritiques,1,0.99,False

I’m new to the coffee machine world, and got the EC885 machine recently with the Delonghi KG200 grinder which gives an option for 3 different types of grind which I do not understand the difference from but know the courser tends to pour more coffee out. 

When I make a coffee, it doesn’t appear to produce much liquid so I must be doing something wrong. I “think” it’s too acidy too. I bought home roasted beans so paid a lil extra for quality. 

I have been reading and watching a lot of videos on how best to use the machine. Some appear to use/ suggest buying a 51mm unpressurised portafilter and a WDT tool. 

Has anyone done similar with their machine and has it improved it? Appreciate any advice. Thanks! ",1,1767552942.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

Anyone know of any? I've called around and if you have told me they don't work on them. The first and third lights are blinking. 

It grinds the coffee but it doesn't suck any water in. I have taken the back apart and cleaned out the pump and the pipes so I don't think it's descaling at least on that end of the machine. 

TLDR: looking for a repair shop. Is it worth repairing or should I just buy a new one? ",2,1767552886.0,houston,5,0.6,False

It’s accessible through a web page and has an Instagram page, but currently the only way to make revenue via the game is through the “Buy me a Coffee” link so any insight as to how to market would be super helpful.  

Pulled from the website is a description of the game: 

“3-dice crapless variant · 11 is the only natural on the Line and the only “shits-out”

SHITS – 3 Dice Crapless is a fictional, entertainment-only dice game. All gameplay uses simulated money. No real currency, prizes, or wagering of any kind is involved.

I only had six left in the pack. Today. I smoked my cigarette with my morning coffee which is what I usually do and I had one left to have with my second cup of coffee. The problem is I have one cigarette left. I usually have that with my second cup of coffee but today I couldn't do it. I smoked a little bit of it and I saved it.

Prompt: 
A cinematic, professional architectural photograph of a whimsical multi-story Starbucks coffee shop shaped like an oversized coffee cup, complete with a green straw emerging from its lid, set within a highly detailed miniature city environment. The scene features stylized characters as baristas and patrons inside and on the sidewalk. The image has a vibrant, high-contrast professional color grade to make the colors pop, with dramatic lighting, 8k resolution, and a shallow depth of field, resembling a high-end movie still or a spread in a design magazine.

I'm looking for new ideas for what to do RIGHT after I wake up. I usually go on my phone, I don't think this is productive or even fun for me but it gives me time to properly wake up. This can be anywhere from 15 mins to even 2 hours on the weekend.

Lately I've been dogsitting so having to feed and take him outside has been quite nice.

Sadly I don't crave breakfast or coffee in the morning to look forward to, and I find it hard to leave my cosy bed.

Escribo esto con muchos nervios y emoción. Después de meses de mucho trabajo, mi esposa y yo por fin pudimos abrir nuestro propio proyecto personal: **NONconcept coffee**.

Llevamos apenas una semana abiertos y, como se imaginarán, empezar desde cero es un reto gigante. 

Es un lugar pequeño pero hecho con mucho cariño y esfuerzo.

Si están por la zona del parque Cricri, nos encantaría que pasaran a saludarnos. Estamos intentando darnos a conocer y cada cliente nuevo nos ayuda muchísimo a mantener vivo este sueño.

—————————————

I leave the library at 9:47—  
time-stamped by the turnstile that clicks  
like a seat belt,  
like I’m buckling in for the short walk home.

My backpack swings light at my side—  
just notes for calc,  
a half-eaten CLIF Bar,  
the key ring Mom makes me carry  
“like brass knuckles, just in case.”

Cold is clean tonight.  
Snow takes the world’s edges away,  
muffles the tires, the distant train,  
the crunch of my boots counting blocks:  
one… two… almost there.

He steps out from the shadows  
where the streetlight almost begins—  
a voice first, not a shape.  
“Hey, Snow-Angel, smile for me.”

I don’t.

I keep my eyes on the sodium glow ahead,  
the halo that means safety,  
the porch that means home.  
He walks beside me without permission.  
I give him the lines we rehearse in our heads:

“I have a boyfriend.”  
“I’m not interested.”  
“No.”

The final word comes out in white, visible breath—  
a small ghost that dies between us.

He laughs—a thin, impatient sound,  
ice cracking on a river I don’t want to cross.  
Then he’s gone—  
dissolved into the dark he came from.

I exhale, a long steam-engine sigh.  
My key points forward like a compass,  
leading me back home.  
I toe off wet shoes in the foyer,  
pad past the living room where Dad’s recliner snores.

Morning tastes like copper.  
Red-blue strobes through gauze curtains.  
Mom on her knees on the hardwood,  
mouth open in a shape that swallows sound.  
Dad has tears in his eyes;  
I’ve never seen him cry.

An officer lifts my backpack from the coffee table—  
evidence, he says, though I’m right here.  
I try to speak, but the air won’t move.

—

They found her at 6:12 a.m.,  
half a block from her own front door,  
in a toolshed left unlocked.

Four layers of clothing—  
thermals, hoodie, parka, scarf—  
ripped and forced aside.  
Snow had drifted in through the cracked door,  
settled on her open eyes,  
covering fingerprints he forgot to take.

At the trial he wears regret like a costume—  
the neighbor from three doors down.  
His lawyer says *maybe she wandered in,*  
*maybe she wanted him.*  
He says *she was asking for it.*

The jury hears how many times she told him no—  
three on the sidewalk, twice in the shed,  
once more when the knife came out.

They hear it in forensic monotone,  
because her own voice is buried with her  
under the January frost line.

They say it’s his first offense.  
They talk of his good behavior.  
His parole eligibility is discussed.  
No one says her name again.

The newscasts call her “the seventeen-year-old”  
and move on to basketball scores.  
The library installs brighter bulbs  
and a plaque no one reads.

At home, the candles keep count—  
one more year, one less girl—  
while the house forgets how to be anything  
except a place she isn’t.

This poem began as a nightmare, shaped by fears many women learn to live with. It reflects the reality that sexual violence is widespread, most often committed by men known to the victim, and too frequently followed by silence instead of justice. The poem stays with the small, human moments that remain after everything else moves on.

In the United States, about one in five women will experience attempted or completed rape in her lifetime. When women are murdered, they are most often killed by someone they knew, someone they trusted, rather than by a stranger. These numbers are not abstract; they represent lives altered or erased, and systems that often fail to respond with urgency or care.

Behind every statistic is a name, a body, a life, and a silence that was forced—not chosen.",2,1767552784.0,justpoetry,1,1.0,False

b.       Exam Payment & Online Exam Schedule via pearson (Same day process), I preferred online since I live in an island far from a testing center.

**Additional/notes:**

1.       [https://pmaspirant.com/project-management-process-group-and-knowledge-area-mapping-game](https://pmaspirant.com/project-management-process-group-and-knowledge-area-mapping-game) they also offer other games like drag & drop questions too! But I didn’t play the drag & drop, just the process/knowledge group mapping game 2 times a day, once mastered you can answer it in 1 to 2 minutes.

2.       If you are wandering where’s the 200 Hard PMP questions & the 100 PMP drag & drop questions, it is already included to the simulator but also accessible via youtube. I only finished ¼ of the 200 Hard PMP questions and 100% finished the drag & drop questions.

3.       I also watched David Mclachlan’s videos on youtube.

a.       200 AGILE PMP Questions and Answers - the BEST Preparation for the Exam! – I Didn’t finish the video, watched in at 1.25x & only up to 30 questions.

b.       150 PMBOK 7 Scenario-Based PMP Exam Questions and Answers – I Didn’t finish the video, watched in at 1.25x & only up to 40 questions.

c.       The PMP Cheat Sheet - How to Tell if You're Ready for the PMP Exam – I finished the whole video

d.       Pass the PMP with NO STUDY – I finished the whole video

e.       Complete Agile Course in 15 Minutes – great video! Finished watching it.

4.       For TIA Simulator & Study Hall, I did not retake the Exams/Mini Exams/Questions, for TIA simulator I just SS and record it via PPT and reviewed how & why my answer is wrong. For study hall you can filter out your wrong answer and will tell you why you’re wrong. If you are not satisfied with their explanation, use ai! CHATGPT & GEMINI is your friend!

5.       For the PMP mindset, this is the game changer and it will really help you eliminate unnecessary answers thus lowering the probability of getting a wrong answer!

6.       I also bought Third3rock notes, but unfortunately didn’t have much time left to read it, but they say this is a good investment too!

7.       My daily review routine is like this Play Process Mapping Group -> Review my notes together with the simplified presentation of pmbok 6 & 7 by ricardo vargas -> Read the mindset shared by AR and MR -> Fast track my notes -> Fast track basic formulas -> then I proceed answering AR Simulator / Study Hall. I do morning exercises, including taking jogs & walks in the morning 30 minutes to 60 minutes though not everyday.

8.       Before the exam, fast track the exam content outline just read it & your brain will do the rest, fast track formulas, fast track PMP mindset, make sure you have a good rest, sip a bit of coffee, take breaks & do stretching & don’t forget to pee and hydrate !

9.       I did the exam via online, I have a good internet connection, just follow the rules and instructions and everything will be smooth like butter. I just wear my favorite white t-shirt, shorts, and socks. I didn’t wear a brief so it added +20 luck on my attributes.

Below that, they’d placed the gasket, and then the metal filter.

Or maybe they just put it together that way temporarily so the reducer wouldn’t get lost.

I ended up building a small side project called BaristaDB. It started as a way to track my own dialed-in shots and preferences in one place, but evolved into something where users can log shots with their grinder + bean and see anonymized data from others using the same setup.

The goal isn’t to give a “perfect answer,” just a reasonable starting range so dialing in doesn’t feel like a total guessing game.

You can also track your own shots, rate coffees, leave notes or discussion on specific beans, and add beans that aren’t already listed.

Im aware that this lives or dies on data quality and participation, so im genuinely wanting to know if any of you would use something like this regularly, what i should add, and what i should remove.

1q3xqzm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1q3xqzm,"in January 2009, 20-year-old Jenika Feuerstein went missing from Mesa, Arizona. 5 years later, her skeletal remains were found in a plastic container near Apache Lake.","On Saturday, January 3^(rd), 2009, 20-year-old Jenika Feuerstein went missing from Mesa, Arizona. She was last seen at 7pm that day near the intersection of Mesa Drive and Brown Road. 

In April 2014, her skeletal remains were found by target shooters near Apache Lake. Her remains were inside a plastic container.

Soon after her remains were discovered, *Arizona Republic* reporter Jim Walsh interviewed Jenika’s sister.

Walsh reported that 4 months before Jenika’s disappearance, one of her sisters tried getting Jenika to check into a rehab center for her heroin addiction. A fight ensued, and Mesa PD was called and took a report.

The officer arrested Jenika after finding black tar heroin, aluminum foil, and a cut straw in her possession. According to the police report, Jenika admitted to using heroin “every day since the eighth grade.”

Since her remains were located, there have been no arrests, and no suspects have emerged. 

According to an obituary in *The Modesto Bee,* on January 4^(th), 2006, Jenika’s 12-year-old sister Ashlie C. Nava, died in a Madera, California hospital.

Jenika was survived by her parents Robert and Maralyn, a brother, and another sister. 

There is a $1,000 reward in the Silent Witness program for information leading to an arrest and conviction in Jenika’s case. 

Questions that remain include, was Jenika in a relationship at the time of her murder? Who was supplying her with drugs? And did detectives obtain any DNA or fingerprint evidence from the plastic container that could be used to find her killer?

1q3xowk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AutismInWomen/comments/1q3xowk/is_this_safe_person_behavior_or_romantic_interest/,"Is this ""Safe Person"" behavior or romantic interest?","Some background first: I'm 45m, going through a divorce, and I have been working with this 23f for about a year. She is extremely attractive, smart, fun and should have no interest in me whatsoever. That being said, she does so much for me that I don't know if she wants a friendship, if I’m just her ""Safe Person"", we both have neurodivergent traits, or if she wants something more.

I would appreciate an outside perspective because I am historically trash at knowing if someone likes me. Quick example: Back in high school, like 9th grade or so, this girl Mel used to walk me to each class while holding my hand and kiss me on the cheek when I got there and I just thought she was a really nice person.

Quick info dump:

* Comes into my office to talk to me regularly for 20 minutes to 2 hours if her boss isn't there.
* She gets me gifts for birthdays, holidays and additional ones just randomly - usually small like gift cards to get coffee or handwritten thank you cards that say she appreciates me.
* I helped her move a large box the other day. It was tall, so I couldn't see her, but she could see my hands since they were on her side. She put her hands *on top* of mine and left them there. When I readjusted, she put her hands back on top of my hands. Then, she swung her hand to grab the bottom of the box and her knuckles grazed my crotch area. I blurted out, ""What are you uh..heh doin'?"" She didn't say anything, didn't apologize, didn't acknowledge it. She just kept moving stuff.
* She has my personal phone number & email address, but rarely reaches out except for work related things. Unless I initiate and then she responds immediately.
* She got a boyfriend about a year ago and when she told me she wouldn't look at me. She stared at her shoes when she told me and acted like she was going to cry. We have never done anything at all other than talk, and that was something like maybe a month or so after I met her.
* She frequently comes into my office to complain about how her boyfriend is a child and needs to get his stuff together. I tell her, I'm sure it will work out.

This all has been happening for awhile, but I would say it ramped up in Dec. The box incident happened about a week after she learned I was getting a divorce.

What is going on, specifically with the box incident. Maybe she just thinks of me as some harmless old man and it's a non-issue to her. Or maybe, she was so involved with moving the box it didn't even occur to her.

Honestly, she is so out of my league this feels surreal and I feel like it's a prank or something. She does a lot of cosplay, and dresses goth fairly often. If she wanted to date me, I would be down, age-gap be damned. That being said, does she? Gazing into my eyes and telling me about your boyfriend is a weird way to go about that isn't it? So, I'm leaning towards safe person, and if that's the case then I'll just chill out because I don't want to betray her trust. Also, it could just be that I'm not used to the attention and I'm reading way too much into all of this.
