I met 21M about a month and a half ago and throughout that time we have been workout buddies, and have gone to get coffee together numerous times. Well it was 4th of July weekend and some friends had a get together and I invited him to come over to my friend‚Äôs place and eat and hangout. He got to my friend‚Äôs place around 7pm and we didn‚Äôt drink at all, fast forward to 10 I invite him back to my house (I have a roommate who said it was totally OK). Well we started drinking Jell-O shots with vodka in them. I won‚Äôt lie we were both DRUNK he had around 8 shots and I had like 5. Well we stopped drinking at 1:50 am and I invite him to just crash in my bed with me. Well he tried to make advances but I kindly told him no and he apologized a lot and we eventually went to sleep. Absolutely nothing happened between us. Well I woke up at 7:30 am for work left him water by the bed for when he woke up and shut my door and left. I texted him saying ‚ÄúMake sure when you wake up you are sober I don‚Äôt want you driving drunk.‚Äù Soo throughout the day he never texted me and wasn‚Äôt active so I figured he was out sleeping. Around 3:30 pm he texts me saying he is still so drunk and can‚Äôt drive. I say okay well it‚Äôs been over 12 hours and you‚Äôve been sleeping all day so how? He tells me oh really it‚Äôs been that long? I proceeded to ask if he drank all morning and he says no. So I get home from work at 4:30pm AND HE IS STILL IN MY ROOM! He is sitting at my office chair playing on his phone. I told him I think it‚Äôs time for him to leave and I helped him find his keys and he left. I‚Äôve yet to hear from him all day,( this happened yesterday) so I‚Äôm just so confused and weirded out quite frankly? Was I to harsh on him or was he actually being weird?

Now what? - i will not promote,"Hello. I'm Eli, founder of a food savings platform that started as pure delivery optimization but has evolved into something unexpected.

# The Original Problem

I was frustrated by food delivery markups (like 2x on delivery orders and $9 whole milk in-store). I realized if I wanted to bring costs down a signficant margin I had to spend 30-40 minutes trying to read T&Cs of various deals and scouring various middlemen to get rebates for my delivery. The complexity of stacking discounts across platforms created a gap that I am entering. So I built SwiftBurst to help users optimize their grocery lists by intelligently combining:

* Store promos
* Credit card offers
* Platform-wide discounts
* Gift card savings

# The Unexpected Discovery

During our alpha testing with under 2 dozen users, something interesting emerged:

* People really liked the tool for Grocery, although Uber Eats and Doordash were on there and I assumed those are mainly restaurant-focused apps and audiences.
* Users built 35% larger carts when using our optimization tools
* But here's the kicker: **Users were equally interested in in-store discounts.**

This last point completely shifted our strategy.

# The Dilemma

Now I'm facing a classic startup problem. I need proof that my app works to get partnerships, but to get partnerships for my app to work I need partnerships.

So here's where I'm at:

**Option A - The chicken:** Pull back from technical/dev work and try to network. Focus on trying to land my first in-store grocery partner. After I get that, integrate the partner into the app and launch a targeted SMM blitz to get my ICP shopping. On the backend, I try a few founder events and coffee chats. Then, reintroduce myself to delivery platforms and work out partnerships with major platforms, dominate that vertical.

**Option B - The egg:** Stick to delivery platforms. Build a comprehensive food savings platform that works for delivery - but since I won't have access to partner platforms, it will be compromised. I can't get real time pricing and I can't get merchant-specific deals. I'm opening myself up to legal risk if these companies don't like it, but the hope would be that I have just enough time to present them KPIs that show greater costs and much higher intent for carts.

I need both user interest and business partnerships to make this work. Solve the chicken-and-egg problem or risk everything on an unproven bet?

For option A, I would only be able to offer my service to people in small areas I can service. That limits my addressable users significantly and introduces a core issue: __how do you land a grocery partner without a proven track record?__

For option B, I run a major risk of legal issues, and I launch a compromised version of my core product. However, my TAM would be nationwide and then its all about getting as much attention from anywhere at all. This idea is sort of like Leetcode's launch (which later became Cluely). 


## The Real Question
Is it better to own one vertical completely or address the full customer journey? Is this one of those moments where you follow the users even if it complicates everything?

I know there's no right answer, but curious how others have navigated similar crossroads.

*Obviously I'm deep in this problem so my perspective might be skewed. I am interested in how the community thinks about these kinds of strategic decisions.*

It might sound a bit weird, but hear me out, this is really occupying my mind right now fully and getting me anxious...

I (30M) have a co worker (35F) who I have been chatting with casually for a while (we are not working directly with each other, we are working in different teams). We've originally just have been exchaning some recommendations and some thoughts. Lately we have been chatting a little more (all still strictly during working hours and not on private channels).  
I am honest I started liking her a bit bit bit more...

She suggested a few weeks back we could go out one day (it was a bad week for her) and chat a bit more in person which I agreed to. 2 Weeks ago we were joking about something ending up basically saying that she owes me a coffee the following week. That didnt happen so I asked last week if we maybe want to meet up this week, combining it with talking about a book we started to read together, so we basically will go out for food or a coffee on Thursday, whatever we like.

Now, I am honest, I wish it would be something more, but its a friends thing. I know its a friends thing, and I cannot imagine it will ever be anything other than a friends thing. And thats alright. She is a wonderful person and I am happy being friends with her.

But I am genuinly anxious, because I know I currently behave differently around her, or writing with her. Every interaction gets me anxious of making her feel uncomfortable or thinking that she might notices and it gets weird or it will ruin a potentially great friendship. It worries me so much that everytime I send her a message I get a heart attack....

And now I am worried about our meetup on thursday.   
It might be an odd question but how do people notice others are intersted in them? Or am I worrying way to much and overthink it as I usually do and all will be fine because people dont really notice that stuff if they are not looking for it?",2,1751925864.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

He is exhibiting severe self-neglect and is unable or unwilling to safely care for himself or his home, putting himself, us, and our pets at risk. Despite our repeated offers and attempts to help, he refuses assistance and continues to live in hazardous conditions. Here are the main concerns:

* **Hoarding:** He has filled much of the house with clutter, including blocking off former bedrooms and preventing us from cleaning or disposing of trash. The home is unsafe, unsanitary, and difficult to navigate.
* **Refusal of Help:** We have repeatedly offered to cook meals, clean, and do laundry for him, but he either refuses or blocks our efforts. He blames us for the condition of the home even though most of the clutter and issues predate our arrival.
* **Unsafe Food Practices and Medical Noncompliance:** He has diabetes and heart problems but does not follow a diet appropriate for these conditions. His diet consists mostly of takeout, microwave meals, noodles, and eggs. He does buy fruits and vegetables, but often leaves them to rot. He sometimes leaves hard-boiled eggs out all day before eating them. He is addicted to coffee and consumes it excessively. When sick, he refuses food we cook for him, and instead we find him eating things like cookies in his car. We are concerned about malnutrition, foodborne illness, uncontrolled diabetes, and poor management of heart disease.
* **Medical and Personal Neglect:** He is almost completely deaf but refuses to wear his hearing aids or communicate with doctors. He nods through appointments without understanding and does not follow medical advice. He delays seeking care for illness or injury for weeks, risking his health.
* **Unsafe Use of Chemicals and Environmental Hazards:** He recently tried to clear a basement clog by mixing two types of drain cleaners, causing toxic fumes. I had to break a window to ventilate the space and protect our pets. The clog is now worse, sewage-smelling water backs up, and he refuses to take action, creating a biohazard for everyone in the house.
* **Improper Management of Medication:** He frequently alternates between constipation and diarrhea, switching pills back and forth on his own, without medical supervision, rather than following a doctor‚Äôs plan.
* **Animal Neglect:** He does not clean his cat‚Äôs litter box regularly, which contributes to unsanitary conditions.
* **Isolation and Emotional Volatility:** He frequently shouts, blames us, and denies problems. He has alienated family, and we are his only support system, but he refuses all reasonable assistance.",2,1751925698.0,hoarding,1,1.0,False

History:

* 51 years old - Male
* IBS since I was 5
* A couple of bladder infections when I was a kid
* A partially duplicated something or another from my left kidney
* Two inguinal hernias for over 15 years.
* 2018 - microscopic hematuria found on a routine urinalysis after I was complaining about feeling like I had to pee all the time.
   * DRE - Normal
   * CT Urogram - Normal aside from finding the duplicated thingy above and a very tiny punctate in my left kidney.
* 2019 - Lifting a couch by myself - felt something pop. A week or so later, I started feeling like I had to pee all the time. My urine stream was weak, had an odd ache in my left testicle, and then my right testicle. Felt like I was sitting on a ball. Eventually, maybe after a few weeks, it just went away.
* Minus the couch, I had this same thing happen a few more times. I went to a urologist and my family doctor who couldn't find anything odd. The microscopic hematuria is there and then it's not. Seems to be random. It's been 7 years now.
* Also - I'm not a coffee drinker. When I do it causes all kinds of stomach issues for me.
* I mention the coffee thing because I do go through phases where I crave coffee. In May of this year and the first week in June was one of those times. I started having my normal stomach issues and decided to stop. That was June 11th.
   * June 10th I played pickleball for 6 hours - one tournament and one cross club league. In the 5th hour when stretching for a ball I felt something ""pop"" in my pelvis where my quad attaches. It hurt but then didn't. I kept playing.
   * June 14th, went to the beach with family.
   * June 15th, played 3 hours of competitive pickleball
      * Very dehydrated
   * June 16th - had coffee and drank alcohol
   * June 17th - had coffee and drank alcohol
   * June 18th started having my urinary problems. Weak stream, Felt like I had to go often - very weak at the end. Stingy in the shaft and tip at random times and would feel the urge to urinate there instead of my bladder.
      * Very bloated in the entire abdomen at this point. Symptoms of gastritis. Still having stomach issues. Pain in lower left abdomen. Pain in upper pelvis in the mornings relieved when i pee.
   * June 25th - Everything was getting better aside from the the stingy feeling and weak stream.
   * July 5th - Played pickleball for 4 hours and now my stream is weak at the end and I feel like I have to go often.
      * That area I hurt playing pickleball on June 10th was aching.
* The last thing I'll add is that I have a very high ANA (1:2560) but no diagnosis yet. Family history is off the charts with autoimmune diseases.

So what do you think? Pelvic Floor issue? IBS? Some sort of systemic inflammation caused by an autoimmune disease. It's incredibly frustrating!

Beginnings are really hard, so let‚Äôs just begin:

INTRO : Hi hello, I‚Äôm Sam!¬†I‚Äôm 29 and have been around the sun enough to want to find my forever person. Currently I'm looking to do my grad program - I'm thinking, Higher Education Leadership or Graphic Design and Digital media, I've gotta lock in one of them soon (the rest of me is locked in, however.)

WHERE YOU AT? : Currently, I am in the US and, more specifically, the East Coast. That is open to changing in the future, as I suss out what my next steps are, the major factors being : grad school, careers, a relationship (yes that's you. Maybe.) and the accelerating collapse of the United States. Yay.

A RELATIONSHIP? ‚Äì \[YES\] : To me, an ideal relationship isn‚Äôt just being in love or in lust or two best friends that eventually shrug and say ‚Äúyeah, might as well.‚Äù It‚Äôs all of those and so much more. You should be able to refer to each other as ‚Äúbabe, dude, lover‚Äù all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we‚Äôll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we‚Äôre House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that‚Äôs okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we‚Äôre running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it‚Äôs together and with belief in each other. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

WHAT HE‚ÄôS LOOKING FOR : Truthfully? I don‚Äôt know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family and beliefs, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It‚Äôs really about more who is inhabiting that person? It‚Äôs who that image is that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor‚Ñ¢ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That‚Äôs a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior‚Ñ¢! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you‚Äôre femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, amazing. Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical ‚Äì and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we‚Äôre golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS : I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil, we start young. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that‚Äôs just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any ADHD excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let‚Äôs go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I‚Äôd love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my ‚Äúgotta stay alive until‚Äù to hype myself up when things seem grim. I‚Äôm also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that‚Äôs a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house, as will Haunted Chocolatier for the very cozy inclined. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. I've been working my way up to being a frequent flier at the gym, we can go gym together if you're into that. Otherwise, let‚Äôs make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I‚Äôll save that for after we‚Äôve started chatting - otherwise, I‚Äôm just blathering into the void as usual - tl;dr, let's do cute, fun, nerdy stuff.

CONCLUSION : If you‚Äôve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I‚Äôm at least a little interesting, I‚Äôve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let‚Äôs figure out if we have something here. The ‚Äúworst‚Äù that could happen is that you‚Äôll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We‚Äôll find out I suppose. That‚Äôs all for now, and what an all it was.

You should be able to refer to each other as ‚Äúbabe, dude, lover‚Äù all interchangeably and mean each of them simultaneously. It is a conscious and continuous choice and commitment, that we‚Äôll choose one another each day over everything and everyone else, through struggles and anxiety, because this is what we have pledged to, working and playing together through the difficult and fun times alike. Very purposefully, my goal for dating is to create a lasting, life long partnership, where we will make our plans together, supporting and elevating each other towards our individual and shared dreams. Want to go back to school and become a lawyer? Suit up, I am making you breakfast each morning no matter how disgustingly early you get up, or at least packing you a homemade lunch the night before, we‚Äôre House Husbanding this if we need to for that kind of career. Are we starting a family? Doubly so, I will HOLD down this fort and get you whatever you need to make it through and I will get myself a cool robotic hand after you crush one of them in the delivery room. Not interested in that, that‚Äôs okay too, we will keep our passports up to date and travel whenever the chance presents itself, whether we‚Äôre running from a regime or just want to go see Mt. Fuji. We can make this whatever we want it to be, as long as it‚Äôs together and with belief in each other. That‚Äôs really what I‚Äôm looking for - something to last a lifetime and then past that so we can keep company in elysium or, your preferred afterlife.

WHAT HE‚ÄôS LOOKING FOR : Truthfully? I don‚Äôt know what my ideal partner looks like or acts like, other than a few basic ideals like: Being kind, intelligent, having integrity, loyal to us and your friends and family and beliefs, altruistic, honest to others and to yourself, has passions and will share what matters to you with me so that I can appreciate it too.

Vibes wise - I find a huge swath of forms and styles attractive. It‚Äôs really about more who is inhabiting that person? It‚Äôs who that image is that is what matters to me, I would not be fooled by that doppelganger subplot or an evil twin for a fraction of a second. I am currently figuring out my own presentation, if I want to express slightly more feminine than just the Bedraggled College Professor‚Ñ¢ energy I currently emanate, maybe we push it closer to Oh, That‚Äôs a Beautiful Hyrulian Warrior‚Ñ¢! As such, I welcome you in whatever style you like - I‚Äôm going to guess you‚Äôll be nuerospicy like I am and probably have some they/them to your she/her. Dresses, jeans, oversized hoodies, athletic wear, suit and tie - if you‚Äôre femme or androgynous or more masculine or cycle between all of them, amazing. Variety is the spice of life, right? Just be you, and arrive to the party healthy and healed and whimsical ‚Äì and also generally close to my age bracket, I think either 3-4 years on either side of me is okay (my rule is, if we could have been in the same four year college at the same time, we‚Äôre golden. We should be about equally developed as people and in the same chapters of our lives, if not the same page.)

LIKES, HOBBIES, PASSIONS : I have been drawing since I could even vaguely hold a pencil, we start young. I was born the same year Pokemon came to the West so, there was a zero percent chance I was going to escape that formative interest. I love Pokemon and will be drawing them for you at some point or another, that‚Äôs just going to happen. I adore cats but all animals too and will happily point out whatever I see on any ADHD excursions we might get the chance to take - Yes I do hear a woodpecker, let‚Äôs go find it. I am a big fan of cooking, both on my own and with a trusted co-chef, and we would in time compile a family cookbook, if we make it that far along. I am big into animation, Adventure Time was hugely inspirational to me, and I‚Äôd love to learn Blender this year - the third Spiderverse film is currently my ‚Äúgotta stay alive until‚Äù to hype myself up when things seem grim. I‚Äôm also refusing to die until I see what the One Piece is, that‚Äôs a big one, and every new release of From Soft, the Pokemon Company, and a Monster Hunter title are a festival in this house, as will Haunted Chocolatier for the very cozy inclined. Martial arts and generally being active and exploring the natural world is special to me, as well as finding coffee houses we like. I've been working my way up to being a frequent flier at the gym, we can go gym together if you're into that. Otherwise, let‚Äôs make our way through every gallery, museum, zoo, and aquarium there is to be had and keep a ledger of the ones we like the very best. I could and would and will keep going on, but I‚Äôll save that for after we‚Äôve started chatting - otherwise, I‚Äôm just blathering into the void as usual - tl;dr, let's do cute, fun, nerdy stuff.

CONCLUSION : If you‚Äôve actually read through all of that - wow, alright then. Clearly I‚Äôm at least a little interesting, I‚Äôve resonated with you even just a bit. Send me more than a hello, tell me a little about yourself, let‚Äôs figure out if we have something here. The ‚Äúworst‚Äù that could happen is that you‚Äôll make a cool new friend (cool is subjective) - the best? We‚Äôll find out I suppose. That‚Äôs all for now, and what an all it was. Thank you and, take care out there <3",1,1751925436.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,1.0,False
1lu7aah,https://www.reddit.com/r/EmploymentLaw/comments/1lu7aah/help_with_negotiation_due_to_harassment_and/,Help with negotiation due to harassment and bullying,"So I‚Äôve been working for an entertainment Lawfirn in NYC since two. No stop bullying, harassment, exclusion etc since day 1. For example an assistant called HR just to tell them that I was asking for clothing to everyone at the office because I was too poor to buy any (mind you I make 160k a year and have no kids and I‚Äôm the most well dressed at work), another time the office manager called me a slut and told me that I didn‚Äôt even know how to make a photocopy just because I had ordered a nespresso machine because the coffee was disgusting, my boss had agreed by the way. I no longer go to any gatherings such as holiday parties etc. it spread like a cancer now assistants don‚Äôt even answer when I say hello. The other day an assistant was aggressive towards me in the elevator and I felt very unsafe. Long story short, my boss (senior partner) and HR know everything that happened since day 1. Of course they didn‚Äôt want me to put it in writing but I did. Well last week I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore and told them that I wouldn‚Äôt be going to the office because it made me physically ill. I told them that we could consider an amicable separation upon my return of vacation. I‚Äôll be back on the 18th. They didn‚Äôt answer. I‚Äôm in France and wonder if I‚Äôm still on payroll. Also I want a package or I will tell the nypost (I‚Äôm saying nypost because I have friends who work there and NYpost would def love a story like that) or there will be a lawsuit. I sent this letter:

Formal complaint and potential separation

Dear HR,

I hope this email finds you well! 

Michael is the best boss I ever had and I'll always be grateful for him. I value my professional relationship with him and would like to leave in positive terms. 

I now no longer feel comfortable at the office. I'm also disappointed that we're still in the same situation, it's been 2 years. 

Also, I would like to know what was done about the latest situation with Laura when she called you on 05/13 and defamed my name by saying that I was asking people at the office for clothing because I was poor? 

Perpetual exclusion, lies, verbal abuse, and aggressive behavior creates a hostile work environment that violates New York employment laws. I have documented all workplace interactions with time, day, and witness since September 2023.

Perhaps we could think about a mutual resolution. A separation would be a mutually beneficial resolution.
I'm thinking of proposing a voluntary separation that reflects the reality that the workplace is not a good fit for me. When I get back from vacation, we can have a sit down or a zoom if needed. about parting way amicably and see if the firm would consider a separation package in light of the ongoing workplace hostility. harassment and bullying.

I have strong grounds for both internal complaints and potential legal action that can provide significant leverage for negotiating a favorable severance package:
-Two years of documented harassment pattern
-Multiple witnesses to exclusionary behavior
-Specific incidents with dates and details
-Company's failure to address ongoing problems

Thank you for your time and attention to this important matter. 

So I‚Äôm a full time employee who makes 160k and I‚Äôm sick of corporate America and I‚Äôm moving to France in September. 
Sorry if this post is too long.

1lu79wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Interstitialcystitis/comments/1lu79wv/newly_diagnosed_this_is_a_hellish_nightmare/,Newly diagnosed- this is a hellish nightmare,"I was diagnosed last Thursday- I'm kind of shocked because this feels like it came out of nowhere 2 weeks ago. I just woke up one day and suddenly I felt like I needed to pee immediately- all day. Sometimes leaving the bathroom just to turn around and go back but there is nothing. I'm getting barely any sleep- I missed my son getting his elementary school certificate because I needed to go to the bathroom *twice* during an hour long ceremony.. that was devastating.

I went to the doctor for antibiotics only to be told I don't have an infection and it's IC- she didn't test me for anything other than bacteria and I left same day with a diagnosis. Told me to drink water and stay away from coffee/citrus and if it doesn't get better she's sending me to a urologist for more invasive testing. She told me to take cranberry pills but I found out today that only makes it worse??? Is it normal to be diagnosed that fast without any other testing?

I complained to my cousin about it over the weekend just to find out she has it too and has been dealing with it on and off for *6 years*.

So, now that I know I don't actually need to use the bathroom, I've been trying to put myself on a schedule- I can't keep getting up from my desk every 20 minutes to go to the bathroom for no reason- its embarrassing and I have no desire to explain this to my boss/coworkers... so now I just watch the clock all day waiting for an acceptable amount of time.  People talk to me and I am jittery and distracted because it hurts so much and I imagine that combined with the frequent bathroom visits makes it look like I'm doing drugs.

So, considering my doctor has already given me contradictory advice- if anyone has any tips/information on what can help me get through the day that would be great",2,1751925322.0,Interstitialcystitis,1,1.0,False

I did some research (to check that they weren‚Äôt made with like lead or anything and see how much it would cost to buy a few replacement pieces.) They‚Äôre no longer manufactured, and sell for $80+ per piece on eBay. 

I never would‚Äôve spent the money to buy these, and even then I would‚Äôve felt they were too precious to use daily.

Same with the kitchen aid stand mixer (free with attachments, just needed cleaning) and vintage Wagner cast iron skillet (free but needed stripping and seasoning, so much lighter than the newer Lodge one I bought) that I used to bake my homemade bread.

1lu78so,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lu78so/teenage_struggles/,Teenage struggles,"Hi, I'm a 16 yo male and i came here to this subreddit to vent a bit to let all this out and to hopefully ask for some help and advice from people who have been in similair situations. So let's begin. In september i transferred schools because i moved to a bigger city, I have never been a shy kid so i didn't really worry about making friends. I followed some people on instagram started chatting with them and all was well. First friend i made from this school was this girl. She was nice I'm still friends with her. I went out with her a couple of times in september and october and all was well i would say. One thing about her was that she was a smoker and i teased her for it and made fun of her for smoking and vaping. This is where my problems start back home in the suburbs where i lived i had 2 best friends and we regularly hung out. Now we lived a bit farther away from each other and all went to different schools but we still hung out weekly. During the time of september and october i regularly texted with girls and went out with them. Around this time i also started getting stressed more new environment so my grades started dropping and one of my neighboors who was 2 yrs older than me offered me a cigarette. Now I have never tried a cigarette before but i have tried a vape and my dad is a chainsmoker so it felt good. I smoked a couple maybe 5 and i told myself no i wouldn't do this. Late october this girl i don't know texts me: "" you seem like a nice guy, wanna go out"". And I said sure what do I have to lose. At this time I wasn't hanging out with my bestfriends that much. I didn't have that much time I was going out with people from school and with girls. I went out for a date with the girl that texted me and for the next month and a half i only went out with her and I started to like her a bit and i thought we are going out ill make it official soon enough. It was december at the time and she said she was 14 but was turning 15 in january so i thought it wasn't a big deal i was a year and a couple months older than her no problem. It was all going good till february i wasn't smoking nor drinking nor nothing, I was dating this girl for 2 months already all seemed well we weren't fighting and I was hanging out with my bestfriends more. Like I said I have 2 bestfriends, Baker and Frank. Baker has been vaping for 3 yrs at this point but I myself and Frank never vaped with him. In february he said we can hangout more so i started hanging with Baker everyday because our schools were close by. Day by day as i took a couple more puffs of his vape he bought some cigarettes and at this time I was stressed and said why not. Day by day i started smoking with him everyday for a couple of months untill I started buying my own and started craving vapes and cigarettes as I had gotten fully addicted to them. The girl I was dating went to a different school so my classmates would always ask me about her and stuff because they didn't know her. In the meantime from february to march I had my first kiss with her and all that, she was my first kiss. One girl in my class started asking me about my girlfriend. She said she knew her ex and i thought oh ok. The girl later that day told me my girlfriend was lying to me about her age, shewas a year younger than she claimed, and my stomach dropped because i started dating this girl when Iwas 16 and she was 13. I immediatly confronted her over the phone and she broke down crying telling me how she wanted to tell me but was scared I would leave her. I lashed out told her how i felt betrayed and that we should meet in person to discuss this. When we met in person she was silent we talked a bit about it and she said she was sorry i thought about it and said oh she is a good girl, we never fought before, whats a 2 year difference. When I said we weren't braking up she started french kissing me in the cafe and i was bamboozled and horny asf so i didn't think anything through i just wanted to feel good. By this point I was smoking a pack of marlboro reds a day and hiding it all from my parents, i was dating this girl and my grades were ok. Baker , my best friend, was smoking weed casually sometimes and drinking sometimes, at least thats what he was telling me. I wasn't smoking weed, I never tried it nor alcohol, it was never exiting to me in that way. After our little fight, my girl started inviting me to her place when her parents were at school and then it was amazing to me. Before that I have never touched a womans ass like that, squeezed it. I never touched boobs or a womans stomach like that. I never properly made out with a girl and it felt amazing then. Almost 2-3 times a week I was coming over and we were making out, she was always horny for that just like I but I didn't wanna have sex with her. That was too far for me. Like I mentioned we never fought but she started starting little fights every week. Then it came to her writing a paragraph to me everyday about something i didn't do, how I am not putting enough effort, but after a couple of hours she apologizes for it and we ""move on"", but we never do because those fights started happening daily. At around may all of this started to feel empty. I felt emptiness inside me about that girl, about those makeout seshions that weren't enjoyable anymore, about smoking about everything i felt empty. I felt like i wasn't truly happy, just stimulated living life like an animal following urges. I started regretting everything. I have had doubt and these feelings creeped up on me beforebut i shut them down. When she was starting fights about every little thing and acting childish i felt repulsed by her. She was annoying. Some things she said were factual and real concerns but i couldn't get it put of my head how she lied to me. All of this combined, the emptiness, the regret, the shame I was feeling because the girl wasso much younger than me. It was all overwhelming me. I felt lost. I felt ashamed for what I have become. The makeouts with her were terrible. The cigarettes were terrible. I felt without purpose. I felt animalistic. I was living life like a literal animal. Only following my current urges and doing things that will satisfy me in the short term. June came, school ended and I started working. Long shifts 12-14 hours. I wanted some money. The whole of may i have been going out with gf less and less it was once every week or every 2 weeks. I was getting bored of her and she was always picking little petty fights and always writing those huge paragraphsthat she would apologize for but when we met in person she was smiling and never said a word. I didn't like that. As I was working she started getting more worked up by us not going out and she was picking fights even more. I was so tired everyday but I called with her regardless. One more reason why I started getting bored of her and more repulsed by her was that she st 13 and 14 was taking off her shirt for me, I was touching her boobs, she was calling me to her apartment and she felt zero shame or regret about that. I was disgusted by myself and by her so i started distancing myself and one night she said let's call. We called and she said I can't do this anymore. I said ok let's break up for now and in september let's have a coffee date and talk about our future then. I didn't want to end it all then and there because i was scared of making a mistake which i now regret doing but i promised her a date so it is happening. She said ok. I kept working 14 hour shifts barely keeping myself awake when i got home to her saying let's call. I said ok. I don't know why. She was crying telling me how she regretted breaking up because she lost a good friend in me too and asked me if we could get back together, i told her i don't want to rush anything like i did before, and that i want to think about this thoroughly. She said ok. The next week she was sending me reels about getting back together and i just liked them then one day she lashed out like :""have you even missed me these days we were broken up?"" And I was mad at that messege because I didn't have time to think about her because of work and I was so tired when I got home and that was the first thing I saw. I blocked her on everything then and there and told her i would call her in september about the date. Significant time has passed since then around 20days. I have been clean of smoking since june 12th but i think i am developing an addiction to porn and masturbation as a replacement. It was there before as well but now since i don't smoke anymore it has been getting from once a week to multiple times a week i don't know how to stop. Iam trying to think about my actions from now, trying to find purpose and fulfillment for all of this and most importantly im trying to find peace. I'm just looking for advice on what to do. How to act next. And general experiences that I lookfprward to reading. Thank you for reading this rant.",2,1751925242.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I work at a cafe with a lot of neighborhood regulars, and one of them came in with a traditional treat from her home country called churchkhela. 

She described it to me and my boss as walnuts strung together and dipped in grape juice.  It sounded fine to me and so I didn't even think to ask any more details as my boss cut me off a few pieces and we tried some together.

Fast forward a few hours and I start to get sharp abdominal pains and am feeling more anxious than usual.  I mentally flipped through what I had ingested  (nothing aside from coffee) and then I remembered the churchkhela.

The lady said it was only walnuts and grape juice, but  might as well check. 

Well dear readers, turns out there are three ingredients in traditional churchkhela.  Walnuts.  Grape juice. Flour.

So freaking excited about this Rotation drop. Honestly, this value is unbeatable. A Pulsar, Deep 27, and coffee plus months of prepaid drops with free shipping is downright insane. It blows my mind how good of a value this is.

1lu76aw,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1lu76aw/what_i_wish_love_still_meant/,What I wish love still meant,"I‚Äôm almost 30 and have had several romantic relationships in my life - not many, but a few.
My first great love (and relationship) wasn‚Äôt even really a relationship. I wasn‚Äôt even his girlfriend. It lasted almost two years, and every time it was me who made a move toward him. Every time it was me who wrote first. In the end, when I moved away, I asked him what was going to happen with us, and he just said he didn‚Äôt care. So I drew the line, even though it was incredibly hard.

Again and again, I tried to get to know someone new with whom I could imagine a future. Someone who could show love and appreciation. Someone who wasn‚Äôt just ‚Äúnice‚Äù, but truly had a heart for others. Someone with passion for life - something that lights him up, other than just consuming (TV etc.). Someone who genuinely wants children and a family, filled with care and meaningful moments.

It‚Äôs frustrating to constantly come across the same behaviors, because people find it easier to put others in boxes and treat them accordingly. Either as a sexual object or someone to have around when it is convenient or because they lack the perspective to see more.

Deep down, I always knew that I could make someone happy if I chose that person. I would give everything - my love, my affection, and appreciation, even in the small things. But getting the same in return always seemed impossible.

Somehow, people nowadays believe love and relationships just happen - without effort or commitment. (Or so it seems in my surroundings.) For me, that effort always felt natural, when I found someone attractive and sensed that spark, that special ‚Äúsomething‚Äù inside of them. 
But most people don‚Äôt even want to give me or the relationship the time for emotional closeness to grow before anything physical happens. They tell me they want to ‚Äútest me out‚Äù before committing to a relationship.
As if our sexuality, our desires and physical needs were always the same, and not something that changes. As if you didn‚Äôt get to know each other emotionally and physically more deeply, when you take your time.

I feel sad, because I wanted to give so much. To love deeply. And I‚Äôm aware that most people don‚Äôt love like that. That my way of loving is seen as old-fashioned or ‚Äútoo much‚Äù.

I want to wake up next to someone and just lie there, listening to his breath, feeling his presence and feeling joy that this person exists - in this world and in my life.
I want to write little notes and slip them into his jacket pocket so he finds them during his day and maybe smiles. Maybe I‚Äôll brighten his day a bit. And maybe I‚Äôll find little notes from him too that brighten my day.

I want to cook together - talk while doing it, laugh, joke around.
 I want to know that I can face any challenge with him by my side or at least that we‚Äôll try together.

That he wants my happiness just like I want his. That he enjoys my silliness, finds my quirky, eccentric traits sweet and that I can see his little flaws and fears and love them too, because they‚Äôre part of him.

I want to start the day with him, when we‚Äôre still in bed and I bring him coffee. Or when he gets up earlier and I can sleepily crawl into his lap just to feel close.

I want to face the difficult sides of life together. When illness or grief make things hard. I want to hold the bucket when he‚Äôs got the stomach flu, and I want him to bring me tea when I‚Äôm writing something and fall asleep on the couch.

I wish he would trust me as much as I would trust him. That he sees the wounds and scars of my past and truly cares for me - just like I would care about his demons that might still haunt him.

I want him to feel the same joy I would if we ever had children. And I want him to invest the same strength and effort into our life together as I would.

But sadly, we don‚Äôt live in a society that makes this kind of love easy. For many people love has become a commodity. And so have they.

In the sense of: I give you money, and you give me a peaceful life and your body.

That idea scares me. Because that would be my worst nightmare - for both him and me.
Because it reduces me to what I can give him, and reduces him to the things others consider valuable.

Of course, certain things are important. You can‚Äôt live without money. But I have already experienced poverty and even almost homelessness.
My parents and grandparents were a role model for me during those times. And I know that you can more or less always build a life together, if both partners are willing to work for it.

My father was seriously ill and still, my mother stayed with him. She gave him so much love and care that he survived, where others in his situation didn‚Äôt. And he stood by her, even against his own family and the world because he wanted better for her.

My grandparents were the same. My grandmother cared for my grandfather for 16 years. Even though most days he didn‚Äôt even know who he was or who we were.
Still, she went into the garden with him and had so many sleepless nights because she took care of him. And in the end he remembered only her.
Even when he was in pain and confused, he didn‚Äôt cry out for God or his mother - he only said her name. It was almost the only thing he could still say.

In today‚Äôs dating world that kind of love seems to no longer exist. Especially because of gender roles and the ideas of what a man and a woman are supposed to be.
I‚Äôm someone who‚Äôs capable in almost every area - including traditionally ‚Äúmale‚Äù ones. And I want someone who‚Äôs like that too. Someone who doesn't hold himself to the typical standards. I want something who gives everything he can and really tries to (as much as I try). 

But many people want a simple, quick solution with the least amount of effort. Gifts, attention, dates - those things often stop the moment they feel secure in the relationship.
But love has to be nurtured like a plant. It doesn‚Äôt stop needing care just because you‚Äôve been together for 5, 10, or 15 years. If you want to keep the feeling of being in love, you have to keep choosing each other.

And it doesn‚Äôt always have to cost money.
A letter or a walk in the evening where you rediscover each other and open up again. That‚Äôs enough.

People say I‚Äôm looking for perfection. But I‚Äôm not.
I just want someone real. Someone alive. Someone who takes the time and makes the effort.
And little things like letters or flowers. They don‚Äôt cost the world. They‚Äôre not impossible.

I believe that beyond social media, people connect more easily. Without it there‚Äôs more time and energy for this kind of love. And you‚Äôre not blinded by material things or the appearance of other people‚Äôs lives.

But it‚Äôs hard to find this kind of happiness because unfortunately, this is part of modern life.

So I grieve the love I‚Äôll probably never find.
And I hope that anyone who has found it, will hold onto it with all their heart.",1,1751925069.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

I made a post a few weeks ago seeking help to determine the source of my glutening. I am making a secondary post to spread awareness.

I believe the source of the glutening was from my the Torani Coffee Syrup I was using. I was using sugar free chocolate. It‚Äôs not listed as containing gluten, (not even as a cross-contamination issue), but is NOT certified gluten free either. 

I‚Äôve gone almost two weeks without it and notice a significant difference in how my body feels. As a disclaimer, I can‚Äôt say with absolute certainty that this product contains gluten. I am just as surprised as you might be to notice glutening from this, but this is my honest experience.

During my investigation, I did find out that some of their flavors, like toasted marshmallow, do contain gluten so double check what you are using. I think the brand is popular among coffee shops and other places with flavored drinks.

Thanks again to all who offered advice and suggestions!",1,1751925052.0,glutenfree,1,1.0,False

She also works from home.

My top few options so far are:

1. A fine mesh strainer for tea. She got a tea strainer, but the tea she bought is too fine so it slips through

2. A tea mug warmer. Like one of those coasters that keep the mug warm. It is summer though, so I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôd be as nice before winter. I‚Äôve also never heard her complain about her tea going cold. 

3. My city has a cafe passport (book of local cafe‚Äôs with some discounts (10-15% off) , but it‚Äôs on back order until after her birthday plus it‚Äôs pretty coffee centric.

At the start of this year I purchased a refurbished Sage Bambino Plus - I use it for milk drinks at least once a day and sometimes twice. 

Currently I'm using ground coffee from lidl but would like to start grinding beans at home. 

Everytime I see a grinder that I think is an ok start I then see posts disliking them so I thought it might be best to ask for the advice of those in the know.

I won't lie, I have gone down a rabbit hole of tik tok videos and now want to buy all sorts of accessories but I think for now perhaps I should start with the grinder! Any advice is greatly appreciated ",1,1751924896.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

I'm throwing my hat in the ring for feedback and tips, and thank you in advance.

For this trip, my 6 y.o. daughter's first trip abroad, I want to see North Iceland while still showing her a good time.  My main goal is to entertain myself with new places/novelty, while catering to her desires and needs (public pools, parks, libraries, *short* hikes, waterfalls, horseback riding, ice cream, simple self-catered dinners, etc). I want every day to be full but not *too* full, and to just spend a lot of analog time connecting with her.

Here's my draft itinerary for 6 days, 5 nights, and roughly 1,500 km of total driving:

**Monday, 25 August:**

* Head straight to Waterworld in Keflavik for a couple hours of public swimming/sauna time. 
* Drive to Gar√∞ab√¶r to stock up on food/supplies for the week (Costco and B√≥nus), as we'll be cooking dinner each night except one. 
* Spend an hour or two on the playground at H√∫sd√Ωragar√∞urinn/Fj√∂lskyldugar√∞urinn.
* Drive up to H√∫safell for the night.

**Tuesday, 26 August:**

* Langj√∂kull / Into the Glacier tour in the morning.
* Drive 4-5 hours from H√∫safell to Akureyri.
* A couple hours of playground time at Kjarnask√≥gur.
* Ice cream at Brynja.
* Hotel in Akureyri.

**Wednesday, 27 August:**

* Diamond Circle north half: Go√∞afoss, H√∫savik, √Åsbyrgi.
* Sundlaug Akureyrar in the evening.
* Hotel in Akureyri.

**Thursday, 28 August:**

* Diamond Circle south half: Dettifoss, M√Ωvatn.
* Hotel in Akureyri.

**Friday, 29 August:** 

* Stable Stop horse riding lesson/tour in the morning.
* Drive 4-5 hours to Reykjavik.
* 2 hours or so at Laugardalslaug.
* Sk√≥lav√∂r√∞ust√≠gur (my kid will *adore* the rainbow street), souvenir shopping, coffee, urban walking/wandering.
* Splurge on one nice dinner out to wrap up the trip (location TBD).
* Hotel somewhere in the city centre.

**Saturday, 30 August:** 

* Return car and fly out at 10:30am.",2,1751924854.0,VisitingIceland,0,1.0,False
1lu72ts,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1lu72ts/question_about_mental_health/,Question about mental health,"I am in grade 11 heading into grade 12. I have been very subtly slowly declining over the years. Didn't have a particularly good family, lots of fighting, swearing, cursing, abusing, hitting, yelling, mistreating, and mistakes that my parents made. They didn't help me, they didn't care. Over time I dealt with a lot of stresses, I got traumatized by certain events as I was young and stupid, faced lots more of stresses and could not cope. I began abusing myself, doing lots of strenuous extreme over physical activity like running up to 25km a day to and back from school, then after school, not eating any food or water since the night before until like sometime later in the evening being equivalent to a 20 hour fast, bad toxic relationships which brought extreme stress and made me feel like losing my mind. I kept spiralling and spiralling. Depression, severe anxiety, severe stress. never saw a psychiatrist for anything. Consuming lots of caffeine from coffee, tea, pre-workout to feel better, cope, and focus on studies as I had really bad attentional, thinking, executive functions as the stress was destroying my cognitive function. So I abused caffeine over the yeras since age 11 all the way to 17. it messed up my brain and growth more. But it helped me cope. Many times the pressure felt too much, I wanted to commit suicide, die, crying, teenage angst and overwhelming emotional events. Eventually i fully withdrew from friends at around 13 with coincidence of online school but even way after, then was alone at home, dreading school, having grandiose ideas for my future and then being depressed wanting to kill myself suffering struggling desperate wishing to just live for the day and just extreme mental pain and suffering. I would rather die, but i went through it. I became sensitive to light, sound, my thoughts were terrible, tactile hallucinations that things were in my eyes, staying up, not sleeping around 13, severe caffeine abuse to cope but that stopped helping. I just continued on, it got worse and worse at 14. At 15 all of a sudden from having had 70s in grade 8 percentage wise and having done nothing academically due to the severe stress which changed my personality and destroyed my intelligence, I suddenly made delusional grandiose plans that I would finish high school online through some private instituion, which although technically possible, but stupid for a multitude of reasons, I actually did which was so rigorous and tedious with so much shit involved and failed it massively accruing extreme stress and losing my mind. I developed severe ocd that year and panic attacks, and fully shut down. It was grade 9. I continued the ocd, broke the washroom faucet handles all over the house due to the ocd and severe mental problems, they were replaced. I was declining dramatically in school and just stayed in this comfortable online position in high school where i used chatgpt to cheat all the way through, and mostly go outside and wander outside through parks and trails all day trying to philosophize my life, talking to myself all day, having primitive views, masturbating, sometimes consuming coffee, being suicidal, overexercising once in a week or two and becoming nauseous and ultimately doing nothing. i got by grade 9 and 10 in a year through cheating mostly and fraud and forgery which I got expelled for from some online schools. I then became a retarded shmuck. began developing full blown delusions that I can't read, and I fully believed, well not believed, IT BECAME REAL to me that I could not read at all, this became reality. Reality was changing, my perception was changing. I went to grade 10 and a full blown psychotic episode lasting months was happening as i was sleep deprived everyday woken up by my parents who gave no fucks about me except that i go to school not knowing anything about me or my life, drinking lots of coffee to stay awake and having psychotic thoughts delusions that I did not know were psychotic at the time.. I spent all day trying to make sense of these symptoms. I had higher grade courses and failed at all of them miserably as my preoccupation and my psychotic symptoms were killing me, leading me unable to concentrate, focus, study, learn, my whole mind had been completely destroyed, my psyche was gone. I did jackshit. No friends, no life. I kept talking to myself out aloud at home repetitively about the same things, what happened at school, what to do, and it was just bullshit, I was retarded. I often wandered alone in the streets again trying to make sense of what was going on. Parents were away and i was alone at home. in grade 11 i fully stopped going to school. was bedridden for months, masturbating eating sleeping watching tv rarely i couldnt watch tv. I got this idea that my brain was damaged from all the stress so i spent weeks sleeping in bed, covering my eyes with an eye mask and my ears with earplugs. I then came to the conclusion that nobody cares if i live or die, this is my life, I can do what I want and must. tried so many things masturbating and trying to relieve the stress. I had been masturbating since a very small age like 7, not sure why weirdly, maybe the stress. So i concluded it was stress which destroyed my brain and mind, so I started obsessively fillinga bathtub with water, then using these chinese eelectric immersion heaters for buckets and small volumes of water to heat it up to like 104 to 111 farenheit, sometimes it was fucking burning hot and I would still will myself in, crazy feeling, pretty much a hot tub, and i would be sweating and fainting dizzy 20 minutes later. I would get out and feel overwhelming relaxation which was misinterpreted from the dizziness and fainting due to low blood pressure drop. But afterwards it would bring back my thoughts and thinking which I was missing, I would be able to think again, be smart, have thoughts, feel emotions, and smell sometimes, I lost the ability to smell anything and everything. I also epxerimented with caffeine pills and just caffeine in general even though i had taken it in excess for years, it was making an astornomical effect on me, bringing back my thinking, sense of smell, reality, world, mind universe back to myself, the good old functioning amazing person and life i used to be and have or whatever. But it would be short lived and increase my heart rate and give palpitations. So I had to stop. Now i've just been obesseedd with being at home all day, filling up my bathtub or a plastic bathtub with water, heating it up, foaming it up, and sitting and trying to relax. My mom who never cared recently says I am mentally ill. I was hospitalized twice lying that i wanted to commit suicide in order to get immediate psychiatric help. Before i was seen multiple times by different outpatient psychiatrists, given meds and didn't take em. adhd, anxiety, bipolar. I got diagnosed with gad at first hospitalization, then bipolar in second at pretty good hospitals. Unfortunately, we didn't give full history and information, and the behavior they observed of me was inaccurate. I was given medications which i stopped. then given different antipsychotic meds in the second hospitalization which made me shit my pants figuratively, I was in sever emental agony, but days were stretching extremely long whereas they were very short and useless. In that sense it may have been helping me, but i stopped and switched to another antipsychotic. Then got my way to come home acting all fine just to leave as i couldn't take it anymore after 2 weeks or so. fuck. 4 weeks of hospitalization. so im at home not taking meds. trying to fill bathtub up all day. but the thing is when I do it, it cures me almost, it fixes me, relaxes me, brings my mind back. my mom is a fucking asshole and my dad is a cocksucker. and i dont know. i dont want to take drugs as it will damage my brain. my parents give no fuck about me. I guess i will just do this, and it really helps almost cures me, because the problem is stress. whenever a stress comes mentally i go back to mental state, but when it gets relieved i get normal. So should i keep doing that with hot water tub or take medications and see another doctor with a good organized history? What do you think.",1,1751924837.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

I'd grown up in an unhealthy environment and knew college or university wasn't something that would work for me (had figured out I had ADHD before I even had a name for it aha). None of the things I was interested in - illustration and storytelling - would pay the bills, and none of the post secondary programs were worth the price for the risk involved. So I just got a job doing something I was already kind of good at and let that carry me... until I burned out.

I've done therapy for the last 4 years or so and am feeling more myself than ever before. I figured out I do still want to draw and tell my own stories, but I need to pay the bills first. So I'm trying to figure out a job that will do that without draining my energy or my body so that I can still work on what I actually love after hours (or maybe on the clock if I'm lucky).

I'm neurodivergent so I know it needs a delicate balance of flexibility and predictability, without getting too boring. I'd love it if it felt like the work actually mattered in some way. Either doing something more tangible than online content slop or making the world a slightly messed up place than it currently is. Buuuut between the mental health stuff and the physical disability, I'm only operating at full capacity for maybe 2 weeks per month. I wish I could do something like work part time at a coffee shop, but there are days where getting up just isn't happening; so remote opportunities are where I'm focusing most of my energy. And before you suggest disability benefits, I am in Canada where even if I did get approved for it, it wouldn't even cover my rent. üôÉ

1lu6uds,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1lu6uds/aio_leaving_my_bf_i_f25_dating_m32/,AIO leaving my bf? I F25 dating M32.,"He was perfect in the beginning everything I could wish for in a partner, he would cancel plans with the boys to stay at home and talk to me. He said he would quit drinking and stuff for me, said he doesn‚Äôt hang out every night with his friends and that he is mature and over all that stuff, but as the time went on he just kept spending every night out with the boys smoking drinking etc. in the beginning he would pick up my calls no matter what or who he is with but then in the last couple of weeks from 9-10 to 2-3am he wouldn‚Äôt pick up my calls(he works as a gym trainer and gets off around 12 after which he would get home and call me before going out with the boys normally but he stopped doing that wouldn‚Äôt even reply to me and I would see him online on fb and his sc going up) 

When his behaviour started to change after I asked him to do something for me, which was to remove random women from his insta. Since he asked me for it first and I removed every guy even my university/school classfellows(he didnt want me following them) I only had two guys left who were both like my childhood friends (we‚Äôve been besties since 6-7 grade ik about their gfs their dates etc everything im the first person they come to if they r heartbroken or need advice) and I stopped even hanging out with both of them since my bf had an issue with it, like before I used to hangout with them atleast once a week like get coffee or lunch but I stopped doing it ever since I got in a serious relationship I haven‚Äôt hung-out with them for the past 2-3 months. Anyways, he would call me negative and toxic when I asked him to reciprocate and also remove women, he would cancel plans with me almost every week, like we‚Äôd make a plan to hangout on the weekends and then he‚Äôd cancel it and disappear for hours 5-6 hrs from 5-6pm to 11-12 pm mostly on Saturdays and when id get upset he‚Äôd get mad at me that i dont understand him and shit even though he has nothing to do on Saturdays he sleeps late and stays the nights at his friends place and go out with them. Then when we‚Äôd finally meet after he‚Äôd cancel 2-3 plans(we‚Äôd meet once a month) he would be so caring and gentlemanly that I have no idea what to think, he would be sweet on chats to, until he would ignore my msgs every night while being online on fb or his sc score going up, he would follow random women and I‚Äôve always caught him following women first and then days later the girl would follow him back, I sometimes think he gaslights me and manipulates me but then I remember how gd he is to me when we hangout. 

One thing that I realised was he doesn‚Äôt know how to comfort me, for context I had been crying one day missing my mom, she passed away in 2020, one day I was missing her a lot and cried in prayer and a few minutes after he calls me and recognises that I had been crying, he doesn‚Äôt say anything to make me feel gd just goes on telling me about his day like the dude had nothing to say about me missing my mom, then goes on to tell me he wants to go to turkey and go to clubs and camp out and shit and enjoy his life for a year or two before settling down because once you get married your life ends blah blah. 

Anyways so ON MY BIRTHDAY he asked me to remove my besties(the only guys I had on insta) from my insta, so I told him I dont even hangout with them anymore or talk to them, and he hasnt removed any girls for me (saying that he has been following them since before me so he cant remove them for me) so its unfair of him to ask me to remove my friends when I had already removed every other guy even my classfellows that I went to uni with for 4 years. He then proceeded to go and follow this one girl that he had removed for me (that too after fighting with me and ignoring me for a whole week) that girl was a new follow, so i had told him that okay ‚Äúif you cant remove the other girls since u followed them before we got together then you can just remove this girl since u followed her today‚Äù he fought with me didnt speak to me then proceeded to remove her, then right on my birthday went and followed her again, after I refused to remove my besties my fking childhood friends that I grew up with. 

That was when I ended things,he came back after a month and proceeded to gaslight me saying that i hurt him and that he had never unfollowed that girl in the first place she was always there and he has never spoken to her and that im negative for thinking like that and that if I stay like this then id never be able to make it work with any guy. Tbh he made me doubt myself and think maybe I didnt make the necessary compromises for our relationship. Am I wrong? Is he right? Idk what to think anymore.

## Expert Answer: Are There Hidden Company Formation Costs in Bahrain?

**Absolutely.** And they catch even seasoned entrepreneurs off guard.

### 1. *Official Fees* Are Just the Beginning

Most guides talk about:
- **Commercial Registration (CR) Application**: BHD 50‚Äì100 (one-time)
- **Commercial Name Reservation**: BHD 30‚Äì50
- **Annual CR Renewal**: BHD 100‚Äì150

But these are just the surface. The *actual* total usually runs higher‚Äîby 15‚Äì35%‚Äîdue to:
- Municipality fees
- Sector-specific licensing (especially for restaurants, consultancies, healthcare)
- Document attestation (if sharing directors with overseas companies)
- Legal translation (for non-Arabic documents)

*[See a full, up-to-date Bahrain company formation process guide here.](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-company-formation-process/)*

### 2. *Hidden and Unexpected Costs*

**The real surprises often include:**
- **Mandatory Office Requirements:** Even ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù or shared spaces in Seef or Bahrain Bay often require BHD 750‚Äì2,500/year.
- **Pre-Approval Inspection Fees:** In food, retail, or regulatory sectors, pre-opening inspection can cost BHD 100‚Äì300.
- **Professional Agency/PRO Costs:** Outsourcing paperwork speeds up processing but can cost BHD 200‚Äì1,500 extra.
- **Bank Account Opening:** Minimum deposit requirements, ranging BHD 500‚Äì10,000, plus legal fees for KYC certification.
- **Tamkeen Registration or Subsidy Delays:** *If you‚Äôre relying on Tamkeen wage support, budget for a 6‚Äì12 week lag period before funds flow in.*

> ‚Äú**I once underestimated the time and cost of obtaining a simple MOICT stamp during Ramadan, waiting two extra weeks and paying a rush ‚Äòcourier‚Äô fee to avoid delaying our opening.**‚Äù (Personal aside from firsthand experience.)

## Step-By-Step Guidance: From Registration to Launch (With Insider Tips)

![Feature Image: Business process and documentation](https://images.pexels.com/photos/669619/pexels-photo-669619.jpeg)
*Alt text: Business process and documentation.*
- Single Person Company (SPC)
- Branch of a Foreign Company
- Partnership and Joint Venture

Each structure has unique documentation and cost implications. *WLLs offer flexibility, while branches often incur higher translation and attestation fees.*

*[Detailed Bahrain business structure breakdowns here.](https://keylinkbh.com/bahrain-business-type-structures/)*

**Insider tip:** Choose a business activity with the fewest pre-approvals if speed matters. For consultancies, the Sijilat code ‚Äú7020‚Äù is almost always fastest.

### Step 2: Prepare Documents (Save Time and Costs)

- Draft MOA/AOA in English and Arabic from template (saves up to BHD 150 in legal fees)
- Pre-certify all shareholder documents at an authorized notary in Diplomatic Area‚Äîavoid embassy delays
- **Timing hack:** Submit after 10 am, before lunch, *never* just before Ramadan or Eid (queues triple, and key officers are often in majlis meetings)

**Common mistake:** Skipping document pre-checklists, which can lead to rejected applications and re-submission fees.

*[Sijilat and commercial registration details.](https://keylinkbh.com/commercial-registration-in-bahrain/)*

### Step 3: Secure a Commercial Address

Even ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù businesses must provide a Bahrain-based address.
- Shared office: BHD 750‚Äì1,500/year (Seef District is fastest for CR processing)
- Dedicated office: BHD 2,000‚Äì5,000/year (Bahrain Bay premium)
- Free zone (e.g., Bahrain Logistics Zone): varies, but benefits include easier customs and lower VAT

## The True Cost: Budget Ranges and Where Surprises Hide

![Feature Image: Financial planning and costs in Bahrain](https://images.pexels.com/photos/4386375/pexels-photo-4386375.jpeg)
*Alt text: Financial planning and costs in Bahrain.*

* **Basic mainland LLC/WLL setup**: BHD 1,200‚Äì2,800 (all-in, excluding local director or sponsor if required)
* **Mid-tier service company**: BHD 2,000‚Äì4,000 (including office rent, legal, and some sectoral fees)
* **Regulated or foreign branch**: BHD 3,500‚Äì7,500 (often higher due to legalizations and sector licensing)

**Watch out for:**
- **MOICT and LMRA E-charges**: Recently increased by 5‚Äì10 BHD per submission (since April 2025)
- **VAT on government services:** 10% VAT now applies to many registration services
- **Compliance**: *Ongoing accounting and bookkeeping services average BHD 400‚Äì1,200/year. [Learn more here.](https://keylinkbh.com/accounting-and-bookkeeping-services-in-bahrain/)*

*Most entrepreneurs miss the fact that even ‚Äúdormant‚Äù companies must renew CR and file annual accounts or face penalties up to BHD 500.*

## Local Tips and Money-Saving Strategies

### Where to Set Up: Picking the Right District

- *Seef District*: Fastest for approvals, strong coffee shops for after-hours paperwork
- *Diplomatic Area*: Best for regulated activities and tactful networking (majlis meetings with government officials common)
- *Bahrain Bay*: Premium image, higher office cost, but makes client-facing businesses more credible

**Pro tip:** **Avoid peak submission windows.** Mondays and Wednesdays early morning (before 10 am) see the shortest queues at MOICT‚Äîespecially outside of Ramadan.

### Document Prep Shortcuts

- Use certified document preparation centers in Bab Al Bahrain for fast, low-cost translation and copying
- Pre-book notary appointments online via Sijilat system to avoid walk-in delays
- Always double-check commercial activity codes‚Äîa wrong code, even by one digit, means a fresh submission fee

**Personal note:** Once, my application was bounced due to a typo in the activity code‚Äîcosting me not just BHD 30 resubmission fee, but also two weeks of lost time.

## Business Culture Side Note: Majlis Meetings, Coffee, and What‚Äôs Really ‚ÄúOfficial‚Äù

*At first glance, Bahrain‚Äôs business scene seems all high-glass towers and corporate lobbies. But the most important regulatory update I received about the March 2025 e-government implementation? It came over coffee in a majlis in the Diplomatic Area, after a casual chat about Ramadan working hours.*

This is where Bahrain shines over the UAE or Saudi Arabia: business is both digital and deeply personal. Relationships and hospitality matter. Official answers often come informally, so always build local networks.

---

## Overcoming Challenges: How I Beat a Costly Delay

*Biggest challenge I faced? Unexpected document rejection due to a missing Arabic translation stamp in my initial MOICT filing. How did I overcome it? Contacted a recommended notary near Bab Al Bahrain who expedited the process for a small BHD 20 facilitation fee‚Äîsaving me two weeks and a potential monthly office rental overcharge.*

---

## Recommended Resources & Tools

- **Sijilat Online Portal:** For most CR, renewal, and license needs‚Äîstreamlines process but requires careful data entry.
- **Keylink Bahrain Services:** Reliable for office sourcing, compliance, and practical advice. *(They caught a critical compliance gap in my first annual filing‚Äîhighly recommended.)*
- **Tamkeen Support:** For wage subsidies and SME support‚Äîplan for timelines and paperwork.
- **MOICT, LMRA, EDB Websites:** Always check for updated regulations ahead of deadlines.

**Always compare what‚Äôs listed online to what is discussed in-person‚Äîprocesses change fast, and insider info makes all the difference.**

## Quick Comparison: Bahrain vs. UAE & Saudi

- **Bahrain**: Faster digital processing, lower entry costs, more approachable government (majlis networking is real!)
- **UAE**: More free zone choices, but with steeper minimum capital and ongoing fees
- **Saudi Arabia**: Strong incentives, but complex regulatory approvals for foreign investors

Bahrain‚Äôs sweet spot? Combining streamlined approvals with genuinely foreigner-friendly policies.

1lu6m6o,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lu6m6o,Playing with the Pulsar,"TLDR: Trying out the Pulsar and found I preferred a 15:1 ratio through the brewer, removing the brewer, and then diluting the coffee to 17:1. This helped reduced bitterness while increasing the sweetness when cooled. Used a locally roasted coffee that I tried yesterday at the coffee bar (sorry DD). 

Starting trying out the Pulsar today. Honestly, I like the workflow of it better than my Colum Mini Dripper. Used coffee I bought yesterday from a local roaster (sorry DD and fellow rotators, but the current drop hasn't rested enough!). I wanted to share a small story and my brews with the Pulsar and maybe initiate a discussion on getting the best out of our coffees for future references. Maybe we can work towards a best-practices through all of our experiences and trials with it and the Deep 27. 

Small story time. Yesterday, I visited a local coffee bar and had the BEST pourover I've ever had. Barista was a coffee nerd that apparently is a pretty decent brewing competitor and is a co-owner/founder of a local roaster. Brewed a washed Kenyan with a Mugen switch and a nucleus paragon then served it over ice. Trying to get a prominent scent from the cold coffee proved to be pretty difficult to me (I don't have the best olfactory skills, curse you genetics). First sip... BAM! MANGO! I've never tasted a coffee so full of fruit and sweetness, in this case mango. Mouthfeel was really nice, full body with a lingering stickiness (if that makes sense?). It's like the feeling after taking a sip of mango nectar. I honestly didn't know I could have that much sweetness come out of a coffee until now. 

The experience reminded me I had my first blueberry bomb from B&W. I smelled and tasted my friend's hot pourover, produced by Nestor Lasso & Jhoan Vergara. Strong aromas and flavors of red berries, specifically strawberry. Honestly, we were left speechless and in awe. What did we decide? This coffee was a result of witchcraft. Picked up a bag of what he brewed for me because now, I have a good baseline to chase with the new Pulsar and Deep27. 

I spoke with the barista and he told me to be careful about using no-bypass brewers. He mentioned that brewers like the Pulsar are extremely efficient in their extractions and if you brew your whole ratio through it, you could get some unpleasant byproducts, mainly bitterness. So he told me to coarsen the grinds more and tighten up the ratio to about 15:1 (water:grounds). Then dilute with just water up to the desired ratio (17:1). 

This morning, I tried 17:1 through the brewer. 30 s bloom. 280 g of water used. Aroma was a bit lacking when hot, but became a little more mango-ey as it cooled. Flavor was also a bit lacking compared to what I had yesterday. I'll admit I was probably a bit too coarse or didn't bloom long enough. 

This afternoon, tightened up the grind by one setting (Lagom Casa: went from 19.5 to 19.0 from burr lock). Did both 17:1 and 15:1+2:1 with 1 min blooms. Thoughts below:

**17:1:** 

Hot - slight mango aroma, flavor was sweet and mangoey, but at the end of every sip, there was quite a twinge of bitterness. Honestly wasn't very pleasant.

Cold - more prominent mango flavor, but the bitterness still persisted

**15:1:**

Hot: Aspects of aroma and flavor were very similar to 17:1, but the bitterness wasn't present. 

Cold: even sweeter mango flavor than 17:1 and no bitterness. 

**Concluding Remarks:**

YMMV with this technique, but doing 15:1+2:1 helped eliminate the bitterness that was coming out from 17:1 for this particular coffee. Sure we can adjust grind size again, but it's nice to know I can just do a quick flip of the recipe to improve my result. Does anyone else have any experience with a tighter ratio through the brewer and adding water after? Does this also benefit something like the Deep 27? Definitely interested in hearing people's thoughts/experiences on this. Maybe even give it a try and let me know! If you made it this far, sorry for the length, you're a real one and you deserve a fat smooch... no homo.

**Recipe:**

* Dose: 17 g
* Grinder: Lagom Casa
* Grind Setting: 19.0 from burr lock 
* Water: Distilled + TWW light roast (full concentration)
* Temperature: 200 F (93 C)
* Bloom: 1 min with 3:1
* Pour 15:1 through brewer slowly, remove brewer after drawdown, and add 2:1
* Barista's Notes:
   * This coffee could go up to 98 C to help with extraction
   * They also used TWW light roast full concentration
   * Coarser grind and tighter ratio benefit coffees like this in a Pulsar to minimize bitter components

He comes from a VERY religious family, this was never an issue for me but over the years, he kept trying to convert me to Christianity. I used to politely decline and say I might look into it one day, trying not to hurt his feelings. But I think this only encouraged him to try harder, and around the time we were 20/21, he asked me to attend an arts and crafts workshop/coffee day run by his church (he worded it as if it was a totally casual thing for charity that I would like because I enjoy artsy stuff). 

I thought it sounded fun and agreed to go, but when I had a look on the church website, it was actually a ‚Äúnew Christian‚Äù event where they tried to recruit people to the church. I ended up cancelling of course but a few months later, he messaged me asking if I ever thought about religion. This was the last straw for me and I told him there is no chance I will ever become religious and that I am and always will be an atheist. He accepted and that was the end of it, but I haven‚Äôt been able to see him since because it bothers me so much that he wouldn‚Äôt respect my decisions the way I respect his. 

I guess I‚Äôm just venting and want to know if this has happened to anyone else? ",6,1751923691.0,atheism,0,1.0,False

I was a lifelong long-ish distance runner until about 5 years ago when I had to stop due to a knee injury. Switched to lap swimming for a few years, now doing road biking. I used to regularly run for up to 90 minutes and never needed to take water or nutrition. I take electrolyte drinks and carbs when I bike, but I've not been too diligent about it.

Yesterday morning, I took off for a 55-mile ride. I took two bottles of gatorade and a high-carb bar. My mid-point was a little town where I planned to stop for coffee and something to eat. I've ridden this far before with no problems.

Yesterday, I didn't need to stop at all until my mid-point, and I didn't drink or eat anything because I didn't feel I needed it at the time. At the mid point I had iced coffee and a bagel with cream cheese. After the stop, I started drinking my gatorade, and about 30 minutes after my stop I ate my bar.

When I was about 10 miles from home, I felt much more tired than I'd experienced before. Not great but not a crisis: I started taking it slow and easy. At about 3 miles from home, I got bad cramps in two different thigh muscles. I stopped at the roadside until they subsided, but I barely made it home the last three miles due to trying not to trigger the cramps and general feeling like crap. Once I got home and got some food and more electrolytes in me, I felt fine. It was a very different feeling than just exercising to the limits of my capabilities.

I now realize that I need to drink and eat throughout the whole ride, whether I feel like I need it at that time or not. I plan to start carrying gummy candies and two bars and will plan to eat throughout the ride and empty at least one bottle every 90 minutes. In the heat, one bottle per hour is probably better. And I will buy more electrolyte drink at my halfway point to refill an empty bottle. 

I considered myself an endurance athlete from my running days, but I learned--the hard way--that there's a big difference between 90 minutes of running (or any exercise) and 3-4 hours on the bike.",5,1751923357.0,cycling,2,1.0,False

Again totally fine to monetize, I'm JUST HAVING FUN!

A few weeks after the encounter with the vampires in the forest you have recovered from blood loss and the hospital has put you in a cast for your broken arm. You are at home reading a book as a storm rages outside. Just trying to get that horrifying night out of your mind.

*The listener flips a few pages in their book before hearing a very light tapping on their window across the room. The listener freezes and looks up to see a shadowy figure outside reaching down to open up the window. The window slides up and the pursuer from weeks earlier steps into the room.*

‚ÄúHello human, happy to see me?‚Äù 

[The listener shifts slightly on the couch they're sitting on just about to scream. The vampire bolts over with a gust of wind and covers the listeners mouth.]

‚ÄúShhh shhh don't scream. Don't you dare make a sound or I might just need to break your other arm.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI don't need anyone checking in on you if you yell. Killing them would be so annoying to have to cover up here in the city and I DO NOT want to deal with that tonight.‚Äù 

[Vampire takes their hand off the listener's mouth and readjusts their position on the couch to be straddling the listener.]

‚ÄúThere you go... nice and quiet for me pet.‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhy are you looking at me like that? Don't like your new title? Well I figure ‚Äúpet‚Äù is very fitting because I own you now. After tasting your blood last time I knew I needed to keep you around. You‚Äôll make such a convenient blood bag for me and I think that‚Äôs a fair trade considering I didn't kill you when we first met. You should be extremely grateful honestly... You‚Äôre the first human I have ever left alive and that is saying a lot.. Trust me.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI think I deserve a 'thank you.'‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ come on pet‚Ä¶ say: ‚Äúthank you (mistress/master)‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNo? Frozen with fear? Or are you taking my ‚Äúno noise‚Äù rule very seriously? C‚Äômon pet you are allowed to speak when spoken to.‚Äù

[Listener says thanks]

‚ÄúThere you go! Good pet‚Ä¶ [chuckles] I'll train you into an obedient little thrall in no time.‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúYou seem kind of confused‚Ä¶ I'm guessing you're trying to piece together how I found you? Well it was pretty easy actually. You had your wallet on you last time we met so I just looked at your ID, obviously. [chuckle] Although even if I hadn‚Äôt I would still be able to pick up your scent from miles away. So really there was no escaping me‚Ä¶ and there still isn't, just in case you get any bright ideas of trying to get away going forward. Any attempt you make to stop me from feeding on you is going to result in you being punished, very harshly. Not to mention it will chip away at my patience until eventually I just kill you and leave you in a ditch. Your blood is amazing but it's not good enough to make me bend over backwards keeping you alive.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThere's that fear in your eyes again. It's only been three weeks since I last saw it but my god if I didn't miss it dearly. I don't think I‚Äôll ever get bored of traumatizing you. [chuckles] You look like a lost little puppy. It's absolutely adorable.‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSo pet, how is your arm healing? I broke it pretty good when we first met.‚Äù [chuckles]

[The vampire lifts up the listeners cast causing the listener to wince in pain]

[chuckles] ‚ÄúAww does that hurt puppy? Well let it serve as a reminder for you to stay in line.‚Äù

[Drops listeners cast]

‚ÄúI find fear is the best motivator for obedience‚Ä¶ but pain is definitely a close second.‚Äù [chuckles]

‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúThis is your place huh? It's‚Ä¶ awful. Are those decorations considered stylish nowadays? Where's the wood paneling, the curvy couch and bean bag chairs? God I'm just now I'm realizing I haven't been in a human home for decades. The style trends fucking suck now‚Ä¶ with these plain pale gray walls and minimalist decor. No wonder your generation is so depressed. No whimsy in their interior decorating."" 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWell my home is decorated with lovely Victorian stylings from my time as a human. You can't beat the classics after all.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ What? I don't live in a castle. I live in a beautiful ranch house just out of town. Got it for dirt cheap too. Many advantages of being around in the 50s, if I had gotten my place today it would have been easily over a million.‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúThe population boom since then has royally screwed you hasn't it? [chuckles] Good luck ever owning property in the future, pet. Your human lives are so short I don't understand how anybody is supposed to get by nowadays. Oh well‚Ä¶ It works for me. The more people on the street, the easier time I have finding meals.‚Äù [chuckles]

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúAnyways, I came here for a reason.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúI'm here to make my second withdrawal from my new blood bank of course.‚Äù [chuckles] 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúBut before I begin feeding let's lay down some ground rules for our little‚Ä¶ relationship. As I said before you will be severely punished for trying to evade me. Which honestly would be so much fun for me but I'm repeating this for your own self interest.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúSecondly, don't tell anyone about me. Nobody is going to believe you and even if someone does‚Ä¶ look let's just put it this way: if anyone other than you finds out even a whisper of information about me they‚Äôre going to turn up dead within a week. Just like that nurse you told about me when you woke up in the hospital. [chuckles] So y'know, don't test me if you care for the lives of your loved ones.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúLastly‚Ä¶ well‚Ä¶ actually just those two rules really. Don't be an idiot and you'll stay living. I'm being way more generous than you deserve letting you mostly go about your normal life so don't fuck it up for yourself. Just know, I could always take you back to my place and keep you shackled in my basement with nothing to do but wait for my fangs to sink in your neck‚Ä¶ day after day‚Ä¶ for as long as you live.‚Äù 

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúNow this is the part where you say: ‚Äúyes (mistress/master). I understand (mistress/master)‚Äù 

[Listener complies]

‚ÄúGood pet. Now, you know the drill. Tilt your head for me.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWow‚Ä¶ I could get used to this sight. My little pet‚Ä¶ neck extended‚Ä¶ obediently waiting for my fangs~‚Äù [end of the sentence trails off slightly as the vampire bites down]

[slurp slorp slurp slorp]

[catching a breath] ‚ÄúOhhhh and there are the tears again... fffuck pet you really know how to make your (mistress/master) smile.‚Äù [chuckles]

[slurp slorp slurp slorp]

‚ÄúMy god I'm still in disbelief. How the hell do you taste so good? I‚Äôve fed off what's got to be thousands if not tens of thousands of humans in my centuries and I have never. Ever. Tasted blood this amazing. Seriously you've got to be one in a million, pet.‚Äù

[slurp slorp slurp slorp] 

‚ÄúAlright, unfortunately for me I have to stop now if I want this little arrangement of ours to last any longer. You've been very compliant for me tonight, pet. Good job.‚Äù

‚Ä¶

‚ÄúChrist I took a lot. Your so pale and vacant‚Ä¶ with your blood dripping down your neck‚Ä¶ fuck this is a good look on you pet. We should do this more often.‚Äù [chuckles]

‚Ä¶ 

‚ÄúAlright pet well I have some errands to run before the sun comes up so I‚Äôm going to leave you for now.‚Äù

[Vampire stands up off of the listener]

‚ÄúIt'd probably be best if you slept here on the couch tonight. Don't want you fainting onto the corner of this coffee table or something.. it'd be really boring if I wasn't what ended up killing you.‚Äù

[Vampire walks back to the window and steps out]

‚ÄúGood night pet. Don't miss me too much‚Äù [chuckles one last time before they walk away]

They were soft, rectangular granola bars (not crunchy or square), and they came in multipacks with different flavors, each flavor in its own metallic-colored wrapper (I vividly remember a pink metallic one).

My favorite flavor had a cinnamon sugar topping, kind of like a coffee cake crumb top, not a drizzle or glaze. The texture was soft and chewy, definitely a granola bars I don‚Äôt remember any fruit inside. Pretty sure the word ‚Äúgranola‚Äù was in the product name.

I‚Äôve ruled out:
	‚Ä¢	Quaker Chewy bars
	‚Ä¢	Quaker Soft Baked bars

I'm putting this out here because I'm currently trying to navigate a ""cut"" and feeling a little confused by all the information thats out there. 

  
I am in my mid 20s (F) and lost about 50/55ish lbs between 2019-2022 and since then I've been maintaining at a pretty consistent weight, only fluctuating 5-10 lbs. Currently, I've been trying to lose some more fat while also maintaining muscle. I have struggled with my relationship to food in the past and I think thats maybe had some negative impacts on my metabolism, but I'm starting to wonder if I'm maybe not eating enough and if thats hindering my progress. 

I work on my feet and don't have a car so my daily step count ranges from 25k-35k.  On my days off/ active rest days I'll go for a long walk and yoga (my last active rest day I walked 13 miles and went to a vinyasa class)- I have a hard time letting myself chill. I also go to the gym 5-6 times a week for an hour and on the days I'm not going to the gym, I go to Vinyasa yoga classes or go swim at the beach. Recently, I've been doing more HIIT style workouts, alternating between the treadmill and weight training. Over the winter/ spring I was focused more on heavy strength training and less on cardio. 

I've had this general lifestyle for about a year or so and have definitely noticed some changes in my appearance, but I've kind of hit a plateau. On an average day I will eat: 

Breakfast 

Either: 

\- 1 cup greek yogurt, 1/2 mango or 2 kiwis, 1 piece sourdough bread w/ 1/4 avocado or 2 tbsp PB and 1/2 banana   

or 

\- 1 egg, 1 egg white, feta cheese, a lil tomato, a lil onion, 1 piece sourdough bread w/ 1/4 avocado  

  
Coffee: 4 oz espresso, 4 oz whole milk, 1tbsp maple syrup 

  
Typically, I wont have lunch or if I do I'll have kefir or a protein yogurt drink and a banana or if I have some time Ill get the chicken piri-piri with double salad at honest greens.

  
Dinner: 

\- 1-2 small salmon filets, 1 protein wrap, a homemade pico (w/ tomato, avocado, onion, garlic, cucumber, lime juice), feta cheese, mixed greens 

\- some sort of rice bowl with chicken, or fish, veggies, cheese- kinda just whatever I have laying around

  
Writing this out, I'm thinking maybe I'm not eating as much for how active my lifestyle is or maybe I need to prioritize rest more. I would just love some tips, I feel a little lost and don't know what I'm doing wrong.  Thank you so much in advance! ",1,1751923041.0,workout,1,1.0,False

* Replica by Maison Margiela (emotional memory/nostalgia)
* Zoologist (character-driven abstraction)
* Toskavat (hyper-niche, mood-drenched, art house)
But the edge is: emotionally resonant, era-inspired storytelling through scent, without leaning on the extremes like fecal musks or gimmicks.

Concept Framework

""√âpoques"" (French for ""eras"") ‚Äî aligning with the ""era"" idea but also suggesting mood, movement, culture, and emotional imprint.

I have never thought it would get that big. I created it just because I lacked content in the game, and non-competitive styling challenges sounded like an amazing idea.

I eat more in the evenings so no I‚Äôm not moving up my window.

But question between two options on which is better‚Ä¶. is it better to do 14:10 or 12:12 and have spaced out meals OR keep 16:8 but snack more throughout my eating window. I used to graze most the day‚Äî a few pretzels here, a piece of chocolate here, a new nuts here, etc. But after reading more about IF, it‚Äôs the insulin and glucose spikes every time you eat so when I started IF, I stopped snacking and will go 3 hours give or take between eating anything to avoid continuous spikes. But I am not sure which is better for my metabolism between those two. Overall, is the long fasting window with more often eating during the feeding time better OR a shorter fasting window and more spread out food?

I still plan to do 16:8 and spaced out foods but want to be practical too and overall just curious what was worse for me, the constant snacking or fasting time.

I've since been working across growth and client success mandates ‚Äî but I‚Äôm now looking to get back into a high-ownership **Client + Product Success** role, especially in AI or Low-Code tech startups.

I thrive in zero-to-one environments ‚Äî not in bureaucratic, slow-moving orgs that reward process over outcomes. I‚Äôm the type of person who sends Slack updates at midnight, survives on 10 cups of black coffee a day, and genuinely enjoys shipping impact.

# ‚úÖ What I can Bring:

* **100% Client Retention which I brough** across the 0‚Üí1 phase in my last startup
* **+45% ARR through cross-sell & upsell** initiatives
* Hands-on ownership from **demo ‚Üí onboarding ‚Üí feedback loops ‚Üí roadmap delivery**
* Proven experience across **EU, US, and Indian time zones**
* Strong product collaboration ‚Äî I *positively pressure* tech teams to deliver

# üíº My Working Style:

* I don't hide behind jargon ‚Äî I speak the language of outcomes
* I do need a day of quiet time a week to recharge and stay sharp
* If I fall sick mid-week, I‚Äôll work Sunday, Holidays to ensure nothing slips as I assume our market would be US focussed
* I prefer automation within slack groups and the live projects to be updated of each and every micro step
* I believing in improvising processes constantly, no matter even if its my first week I am open for blatant strong feedbacks and even ready to give inputs for improvising the product making project progress more effective.
* I believe in treating senior professionals with respect and may call people 10 years elder me as Sir , that's nerdy but I am still not Americanised
* I'm driven, a little anxious, a bit ADHD when reading long docs ‚Äî but never lazy

# üìç My Ask (and Offer):

* **Location:** Ready to move to Bangalore, Gurgaon, Pune, Chandigarh or Hyderabad
* **Equity:** Open to modest ESOPs (CTC: 100‚Äì20% above current CTC)
* **Upskilling:** Will self-fund any certifications required
* **Trial:** Happy to work **one month without salary** (with a stay at a decent property + food)
* **Post-trial:** You assess and decide if I fit
* **Commitment:** Willing to sign a bond ‚Äî 1 to even 4 years ‚Äî if we click

During the trial month, I‚Äôd expect:

* A 7‚Äì14 day immersion with your team
* Deep onboarding on your product, personas, ops, and client journeys
* A clear challenge or KPI to prove myself
* Spend time with your team at work cafes, beyond the office hours and discuss work
* No Probation of 2 quarters after I am confirmed, as a trial gives you a fair chance to access me thoroughly.

You can choose to credit only 70% of the first month's  salary by the start of second month.

1lu633u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lu633u,Safe to use pond water and chicken manure in compost?,"Hi folks, compost noob here. I've got a small hobby farm, and I'm trying to figure out the best practice for composting with the resources I have available. My goal is to make good use of various waste products and make a nutritious fertilizer for my plants and trees. 

For context, I have a few rows of recently planted Emerald Green Arborvitae trees, about 40 trees in all. I'm also planning to plant some mature juniper trees around the property.

**What I have:**

* 4 chickens - source of chicken manure and pine shaving bedding
* 275gal goldfish pond - filtered through a 50gal bog. source of pond water/muck. 
* Kitchen scraps - I add these to a compost tumbler with dry yard waste. Egg shells, veggie scraps, coffee grounds, etc. 

I currently throw all my chicken manure/fluff and kitchen scraps in a big pile and moisten and turn it a few times a week. This has resulted in a pretty big pile that seems to be breaking down decently. 

**To make use of everything, I'm picturing:**

* Combining the kitchen scraps and chicken fluff/manure in the main compost pile.
* Putting broken-down compost in a bucket. 
* Adding flushed bog water and muck to the bucket.
* Steeping and straining the bucket to make a tea. 
* Watering down the tea to pour on trees. 
* Add the compost back to the pile or use it as mulch.

**Concerns:**

Could the bacteria, algea, etc from the pond be bad for the trees? I've seen pond people routinely use their flushed bog water for plants, so it seems like the thing to do.

Could combining the pond water with chicken manure be bad? And steeping it? Maybe it depends how broken down the manure is? I made a small batch of tea to test this method the other day and the result was pretty foul. 

It'd be great to have a use and central place for all these waste products as I'm cleaning out my chicken coop and pond, but I don't want to inadvertantly make a hazard or start covid-25.

The chart looked like a rocket launch.

Overdose deaths ‚Äî opioids, heroin, synthetic fentanyl ‚Äî climbing year after year. A clean, brutal curve. The kind that doesn‚Äôt go back down.

> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a new epidemic hitting the United States,‚Äù the news anchor said. ‚ÄúIn 2015 alone, over 52,400 Americans died from opioid overdoses. Experts say it‚Äôs only getting worse.‚Äù

Jared paused the clip. He‚Äôd seen graphs like this before. But not like this.

He was a pharmacist. He taught pharmacy law at night. He understood how broken things were ‚Äî but still, this hit him in the gut.

*Jesus*, he thought. *This is insane.*

People were dying quietly. Alone. In shame. Not just because they were addicted, but because the system demanded they suffer for it. If you wanted Narcan ‚Äî the one drug that could save your life mid-overdose ‚Äî you needed a prescription. Which meant walking into a clinic and saying something insane like:

> ‚ÄúHey doc, I‚Äôm addicted to putting the needle in my arm. Can I get a drug that‚Äôll keep me from dying next time?‚Äù

Most people wouldn‚Äôt say that. Most families didn‚Äôt even know what Narcan was. And if they did ‚Äî were they even allowed to give it to someone else?

He knew the legal answer. He taught the legal answer. It didn‚Äôt make it feel any less stupid.

*The system didn‚Äôt just fail people. It punished them.*

Jared was tired. Not just of the job. Of Seattle. Of the rain. Of the isolation.

He‚Äôd lived there three years and still felt like an outsider. It was the kind of city where people smiled but didn‚Äôt invite you in. Coffee shops filled with headphones and overpriced minimalism. Conversations that ended in ‚Äúwe should grab a drink sometime,‚Äù but never did.

He wanted out.

And maybe ‚Äî just maybe ‚Äî he‚Äôd found a way.

He‚Äôd applied for a global public policy role at one of the top pharmaceutical companies in the world. It was his dream job. The kind of position that could let him fix the system from the inside ‚Äî work on international drug access, push policy, bring meds into underserved markets. Use corporate power for actual good.

They flew him out. First class. Final three candidates.

He wore an $800 suit to the interview ‚Äî which was hilarious, because Jared was a proud cheap-ass who hadn‚Äôt spent more than $100 on anything in years. But this was different. This was *everything*.

What he lacked in pedigree, he made up for in obsession. For months, he‚Äôd been spending nights at the library ‚Äî reading books on corporate strategy, patent law, global access programs. He even built a slide deck explaining how international medication patents could be restructured for developing nations.

He had no MBA. No mentors. No experience in policy or business.

Just a pharmacist with a fire under him.

He met Ron on the flight home.

They were seated next to each other, two strangers headed back to the same rainy city. Ron looked over and made a comment about Jared‚Äôs suit ‚Äî said he looked overdressed for a tech conference. Jared smiled and told him the truth: he was coming back from an interview.

That was all it took.

They talked the whole flight.

About everything and nothing. Why America felt broken. Why Seattle felt lonely. Why healthcare punished the people it was supposed to protect. Ron wasn‚Äôt flashy. Didn‚Äôt talk credentials. Just asked great questions. Listened with intent. He felt more human than anyone Jared had met in months.

At one point, Jared confessed he wanted to get into politics one day. It slipped out ‚Äî something he normally wouldn‚Äôt say to anyone.

Ron just nodded.

When they landed, he said, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs stay in touch.‚Äù

Jared didn‚Äôt believe him. Seattle had a way of making even kindness feel performative.

But two days later, his phone rang.

> ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a guy I know who wants to pitch me his startup,‚Äù Ron said. ‚ÄúThought it might be fun for you to sit in.‚Äù

Jared was curious.

They met at a Starbucks. The founder showed them a small hardware device ‚Äî a panic button for women walking home alone. It would connect to an app, alert someone if they felt unsafe.

The pitch wasn‚Äôt great. The guy was nervous. The idea felt half-baked. But Jared couldn‚Äôt stop watching Ron.

He was calm. Focused. Watching the *person*, not just the product.

Later, Jared would learn the word for what Ron was: an angel investor. A man who could change someone‚Äôs life with one check. Jared hadn‚Äôt known that on the plane. But it made sense.

Ron didn‚Äôt lead with power. He led with interest.

Over a few coffees, Ron gave Jared something he hadn‚Äôt heard from anyone else.

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt waste your life pushing paper in a tower,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd don‚Äôt go into politics. I did that for years ‚Äî it‚Äôs mostly theater. You get beat up in public and can‚Äôt actually fix anything.‚Äù

What mattered, Ron said, was solving a *real* problem.

Not writing a white paper.  
Not debating on a panel.  
Actually fixing something broken.

That stuck with Jared.

A week later, the pharma company called.

He didn‚Äôt get the job.

And for the first time, instead of feeling crushed‚Ä¶

He felt free.

He didn‚Äôt know what was next. But for the first time in a long time, he was excited to figure it out.",1,1751922208.0,writingcritiques,0,1.0,False

M30 & F29,"So, I 30m have been with my partner 29F for 6 years, we‚Äôve had a break before but everything has been relatively all okay. It‚Äôs been hard to get her family to accept me and my work, (don‚Äôt see me good enough for her) we started off really sexual, anywhere anytime kind of vibe. Was amazing! We‚Äôre into the same things (because she has taken a liking into my hobbies) and we live together now for the last 2 years.

Here‚Äôs the issues, without being horrible, she‚Äôs gotten lazy and doesn‚Äôt care about much really at all. She doesn‚Äôt care about appearance anymore, hair, clothes, etc. has put on weight and now sits around saying she isn‚Äôt happy with how she looks but when I offer help or advice or a training programme she won‚Äôt do it or makes an excuse like too tired, or not confident. She doesn‚Äôt really take an interest in my stuff anymore or if I want help or support it‚Äôs not really there, the words are there but the action isn‚Äôt anymore?

I feel like we‚Äôre drifting, like friends, i want to feel like my woman needs me, craves me wants me, loves me like I‚Äôm the shit and my shit don‚Äôt stink kinda support and love! I feel like she doesn‚Äôt love love me anymore, like I don‚Äôt feel craved and wanted she says she does but I just don‚Äôt feel it anymore. I feel lost and craving/looking for it. Said this for over 2 years now, and it‚Äôs a constant argument ever 6 months

If we have convo about it, she‚Äôll ‚Äòrealise‚Äô and change for maybe 2 weeks and slowly go back to it again. She says it‚Äôs because I don‚Äôt help as much with housework anymore so if I can‚Äôt do that why would she wanna give me all this love and sex etc.

I find it hard to get this as I feel as though mine is an emotional need from my partner to feel a certain way for connection where as hers is more a physical chore. Like if we wasn‚Äôt living together it wouldn‚Äôt be a thing for her side but mine is always there?? Maybe I‚Äôm a douche? I just now feel when she‚Äôs being nice or loving it feels forced and abit weird ? Plus sex isn‚Äôt a connection 50% of the time‚Ä¶.

Now the difficult part, I went to a family fun event with friends who have kids and met a single mum of 3kids!!! (I said I wouldn‚Äôt get with a single mum) The same age as me, and we‚Äôve both had the same kinda raising and previous relationship issues.

We got introduced, she‚Äôs attractive but nothing like my partner now who has a body to die for! But she found me very attractive and complimented me plenty of times modestly. This mum call her (S) asked about my situation and if I would like to ever have a coffee. I said I can‚Äôt I‚Äôve got a partner even though it‚Äôs not great right now I wouldn‚Äôt cheat‚Ä¶ roll on a few more hours and we‚Äôre just clicking on everything. I now can‚Äôt stop thinking about (S) she made me feel wanted, needed, loved. She came from a very abusive relationship and this is why the dad is not on the scene anymore.

I guess what I‚Äôm asking is, am I being stupid. Relationships are like this and just carry on? Should I keep asking throughout my relationship to fix the issue of how I‚Äôm feeling? Is my time done? Sell the house move on?

Is this other girl the one but got 3 kids?  Wtf do I do guys!? (Oh it‚Äôs so hard for me to make decision or know what‚Äôs right as I‚Äôve been homeless before and my partner helped me get life straightened 6 years ago and support that, I don‚Äôt wanna end up on a bad place again ) Also, mentally it‚Äôs so much pressure and I do suffer with alot of anxiety or depression so I just replaying and not getting to the end of anything.

Thanks guys

TL;DR short summary:

Ever feel like you're throwing spaghetti at the wall, just to see what sticks? Yeah, me too. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Whether you‚Äôre just diving into the AI creator space or you've been playing around with it for a bit, **time is a precious resource**. And if you‚Äôre not careful, it can slip through your fingers faster than your last social media post got likes. üòÖ

So let's talk about how to **stop wasting time** and start making some real progress before the next big gold rush in AI content creation kicks in! Here‚Äôs your go-to creator growth guide for AI noobs who want to work smarter, not harder.

**1. Define Your Niche:**
   - Are you all about travel tips? Maybe you‚Äôre super into plant care? üå± Whatever it is, solidify your focus. You don‚Äôt want to be a jack-of-all-trades and master of none. 
   - Zeroing in on a specific niche helps cut down the endless research rabbit holes. Think of it as your content compass! üß≠

**2. Embrace AI Tools:**
   - There‚Äôs a ton of AI out there just waiting to make your life easier. Need catchy headlines? Grab an AI headline generator! üì∞ Want to beat writer‚Äôs block? Use an AI writing assistant. 
   - Remember, the goal is to automate the boring stuff so you can focus on the creative magic! 

**3. Set Realistic Goals:**
   - Instead of saying, ‚ÄúI want to be famous,‚Äù break it down. How about ‚ÄúI‚Äôll post 2 engaging TikToks every week‚Äù? üìÖ 
   - Easy peasy! The smaller the steps, the less overwhelming it feels. Plus, you can celebrate those small wins! üéâ

**4. Learn to Repurpose Content:**
   - You don‚Äôt have to reinvent the wheel every time. Got a blog post? Turn it into a video, create infographics, or even podcasts. üìä
   - Repurposing saves time and gives you multiple platforms to engage your audience. üôå

**5. Network Like There‚Äôs No Tomorrow:**
   - Seriously, connect with other creators! Whether it‚Äôs collabs, shoutouts, or just sharing tips over coffee chats (virtual or otherwise), building your squad can expedite growth. 
   - Remember, an army of minds is better than going solo!

**6. Don‚Äôt Sweat the Small Stuff:**
   - Perfection is the enemy, folks! If you‚Äôre waiting for that ‚Äúperfect‚Äù piece of content, you‚Äôll be wasting time and missing out on opportunities. üöÄ 
   - Aim for progress instead of perfection‚Äîyour audience will thank you for being real!

Honestly, the world of AI content creation is exhilarating! üí• But with all this shiny new tech, it‚Äôs easy to get bogged down. So, let‚Äôs hustle smart!

Chemical Exfoliants are superior in every sense.

\- more gentle  
\- more benefits  
\- more effective

Also scrubs can dry out your skin, cause microtears in your skin, the emolients are added to mask the dryness and tightness. Anything that makes you feel squeaky clean, should be avoided.

I don't mean to be biased, but there's probably a strategical reason why Jenpharm is giving their coffee scrub for free instead of actively advertising it through dermatologists like their moisturiser or cleanser.

1lu5sxm,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfpublish/comments/1lu5sxm/things_id_wished_id_known_before_i_bought_atticus/,Things I'd Wished I'd Known Before I Bought Atticus,"I've had Atticus for a couple weeks now. I think I like it overall. I say ""I think"" because while there are things I really like about the ""app"" (I'm not going to call it a program, more on that later), there are also a number of things I don't like. If the app were, say, $50, I'd probably be fine with it. But for $147, I'm still trying to decide if all these things together are a deal breaker.

So, there are a number of things I didn't realize about the app until I bought it and used it. I thought maybe this information was on the site, and I just missed it somehow, but I went back and looked, and it's not. I may add to this list if I think of things I forgot or find more issues, or if anyone else points out something I missed.

1.) The number one thing is it is NOT a program you install on your computer. It is a web app. Which is to say, it is web-based, basically just a website you go to and use. Most of the other issues I have with the app are a result of this one fact, which is not disclosed anywhere that I can see on their site.

You may wonder why this is such a bad thing, and there are a number of reasons. I'll try to remember them all.

2. You have to be online to use it. They say you can use it offline, which you can, sort of, but with caveats that make it basically useless offline. You have to be online to load your book. Supposedly you can load your book, and then go offline and still work with it. But what's the use case for that? Also, I don't think I'd trust it. If the site or server goes down, you can't open your book. It also ""saves to the cloud"" so you can't save your book either unless you're online. Your only offline options to save are to export to a .docx document (not a real save) or back it up to a .json file, which I don't even know if you can open and use without having a connection to the website.

3. They say you get ""Ongoing Updates for Life"". The site specifically says: ""Ongoing Updates for Life¬†‚Äì Pay once and you‚Äôll receive ongoing updates, including new features and improvements ‚Äì forever!"" Is this true? Yes and no. What it really means is you get updates for the life of the website/company, definitely not forever. With a program on your computer, if the company behind it goes bankrupt, or their server goes down, or they get hacked, you can still use the program, maybe not forever, but as long as you want to. You may not get any more software updates, but you can still run and use the version you have on your machine. None of this is true with Atticus. There is no software on your machine. If the site or server goes down, you can't open or edit your book(s). If the company goes bankrupt or just decides to call it quits, you can't open/edit your book(s). So to say you get ""ongoing updates forever"" is a bit...less than fully honest, let's say. 

4. Because the app is constantly communicating with their servers, it's slow. Every time you change chapters, you watch a wheel spin for a few seconds while it loads. This is one of the multiple reasons I would never actually write a book in the app, even though they consider this a major selling point. It will often lag, leading to mistakes in your typing when it lags. It also slows the whole process compared to something like Word where changing chapters is instantaneous. Over the course of a novel-length manuscript, those seconds will add up and get very tiresome. Also, I'm using high-speed broadband internet. If you have a slower connection for whatever reason (maybe you're using wi-fi in a coffee shop or library), it's probably going to be even slower. 

5. They say you can use it on any machine with a web browser. This isn't 100% true, or at least it doesn't mean what you probably think it means. You have to use Chrome. It doesn't seem to work right in any browser other than Chrome. I use Brave, which is Chromium based, and when I contacted their tech support about the lag issues, their first instruction was to only use it on Chrome. That I have to use it only on Chrome was not disclosed before purchase. In addition to that, they want me to use it in incognito mode. Also, if you use any extensions in chrome, they may or may not cause problems with Atticus.

6. You can't follow best practices with Word. This isn't quite as bad as the other things, but it's annoying. I use best practices in Word, which is to say I correctly use Styles. Atticus can't understand any Styles except the heading styles. So if, for instance, you use a Style for italics, you have to go back and change all those to just the font with italics. Now it wasn't too bad to do that, as they give you a tutorial. But I don't think you should have to do that, and also I think some people would have issues with that process and it would lead to problems with the formatting of their novel. I also had to deal with this again, as I used a small caps Style for text messages in the book.

7. Atticus can't handle chapters longer than 8,000 words. Luckily this wasn't an issue for me. There's a tutorial for that too, but I can't speak to that as I thankfully didn't have to use it.

Now in fairness, there are things I do like about the app. It does make formatting the book for ebook and print very easy. Importing the book is another story. That was a PITA because Atticus can't use Styles. It gives you a preview of the book on various devices, which is nice. There are a lot of fonts to choose from, and different ways to make your chapter headers work, which is all cool and easy to use. It can deal with Header 1, Header 2, etc. So if you follow best practice and are using Header 1  for your chapter titles, it'll bring that in no problem. But if you're doing anything more with Styles than that, you're going to have to jump through some hoops when you import the book.

It's really lacking in functionality as a word processor, though, so I'd never write my manuscript with Atticus, plus there are the lag issues. It's really only useful for doing the final formatting for ebook/print.

If this had all been disclosed more honestly and transparently before I paid $147, I might feel differently. There's also no free trial, so you don't learn any of this until you shell out the money. I also think $147 is way too much considering it's only a web app, it's really only useful for formatting, not as a word processor, and you won't be able to use it if anything happens to the company, site, or server (or if you're offline). 

The lack of transparency, and seeming bait and switch, is a real sticking point for me, I think. Because I am beholden to their website to do anything with this app, I have to trust in the company that they will continue to be there and continue to support the app. So it really doesn't sit well from me when they don't disclose any of these downsides and leave you to discover them on your own after you've already made a purchase.

So there you go. Those are the things I wish I'd known before I bought Atticus. Hopefully this will be helpful to you in making your decision if you're considering getting this app. I only wish I'd found something like this before I bought it. Now I have to decide whether I'll keep it, or whether I'll find out if they'll honor their 30 day money back guarantee.",10,1751921807.0,selfpublish,1,0.92,False

I wasn't surprised to find the leak at the connection of the pump and the self priming s2 valve as I had some trouble getting the threaded plastic parts to lock in place securely.  I took a look at the old pump and it appears that there was some kind of thread lock used to secure it.

1- proper sleep: It's not to be underestimated. Proper sleep is around 7-9hrs. Some tips to get this is to avoid coffee in the afternoon and to cut screen usage for at least 1hr before bed. Trying to get in bed and to wake up at same times everyday also helps

  
2- proper food: I realized that staying clean helped me a lot. I usually feel no hunger when it cames, which in my case help. Just try to cut some sugar and ultraprocessed foods as much as you can, switching to fruits and it will improve.

  
3- Exercise: It can be a walking in the park, hit the gym with medium effort workouts. If you can't afford a gym you can explore training systems like calisthenics. The goal isn't even to get fit, but to spend time outside and to get some sense of accomplishment.

  
4- Journaling/Meditation: It's hard to reach out to people. I too feel anxiety and isolation and I discover that writing down how you are doing also helps a lot. Remember that no one ever needs to read this. I think that this works because it's a way to empty ourselves. Sometimes we store so much thoughts and feelings and regrets that our minds get clouded. put on paper helps relieve that.

  
5- Social media usage: It's easy to spend time on this things. I am also guilty of that. But I realize that your mind gets clearer when you aren't stuffing with hours of short content videos. There is a thing called cognitive overload and tihs can really mess up with our mental faculties. So if you can reduce your usage, it will help with clarity in the long term.

And please, if you guys are feeling down, try to seek help. Always remember that you are not alone and there are people out there willing to offer help.

""Hello, and welcome back to Unheard Voices. This time, we‚Äôll be listening to Ashley Thompson.

On the late night of August 12, 1997, I went out on a date at Lockhart Smokehouse. I returned to my apartment ‚Äî 2508 Ivy Brook, in Arlington ‚Äî early on August 13. Later that morning, I called my boss to say I‚Äôd be late for work.

I never showed up.

On January 5, 1998, some hunters found my body in a wooded area near a creek, in the 6200 block of Baraboo Drive, Dallas. I‚Äôd been shot.

During that time, a homicide task force had been formed by the Fort Worth Police Department. Several female bodies had turned up across the region. Mine was one of the cases they investigated...

Stay tuned every Saturday for weekly episodes, where we give voices to those who can‚Äôt speak"".

David ended the recording, saved the file, and shut his laptop with a soft click. He slid into bed, exhaustion pulling at him. The room was still, lit only by the dim red glow of his audio interface.

In sleep, the memories crept in.

The air had smelled like rain. And something sweet, jasmine maybe.

There were flashes. Fragments.

A red scarf flapping in the wind.
Someone calling his name.
A scream sharp, then swallowed by silence.
He saw her. Maybe.

A silhouette at the top of the stairs. Her face turned. Or missing. Blurred like an old photograph left in the sun too long.

He woke in the dark, gasping. Heart hammering against his ribs like it wanted out.

His shirt was soaked. The sheets too. Cold sweat clung to him the kind that whispered something was wrong, even if you couldn‚Äôt name it.

He sat upright, unmoving. Just breathing. Fast. Shaky. Trying to piece it together.

Then, across the room, he saw on the wall.

Old newspapers. Crime scene photos. Handwritten notes. Pinned and webbed together by red string.

At the center, written bold and unrelenting:

Who did it?

Chapter 2: Whispers from the File

The night clung to the city in heavy silence. Outside, the occasional hiss of passing cars. Inside, only the low hum of David‚Äôs computer and the soft buzz of his desk lamp.

He sat at his desk, headphones around his neck, eyes on the screen. Ashley‚Äôs voice still echoed in his mind. Her story had rattled something in him not just sadness, not just anger.

Something else.

Familiarity.

He leaned back and stared at the ceiling for a moment, letting the stillness settle. Unheard Voices had started years ago, back when he was barely old enough to rent the apartment he now lived in. It was supposed to be about giving victims a voice. It still was.

But somewhere along the way, it had become something more personal.

Something unfinished.

He glanced toward the corkboard in the corner, his mother‚Äôs case still taking up the most space. A shrine of frustration and stubborn hope.

""MOTHER OF ONE FOUND DEAD IN FORT WORTH ALLEY ‚Äì NO SUSPECTS""
The headline stared back at him, circled three times in red.

He rubbed the back of his neck, stood up, and stretched.

Just for a moment, he reached for a few older folders from his filing cabinet. Something in Ashley‚Äôs case had struck a chord, but he couldn‚Äôt name it. So he followed the feeling.

He laid out a few past episodes, the ones that had stayed with him longer than most.

Episode 1 ‚Äì Natasha Lane (covered year one)

Episode 2 ‚Äì Lana Walters (season two)

Episode 3 ‚Äì Emily Monroe (last year)

Episode 4 ‚Äì Ashley Thompson (just posted tonight)

He flipped through them without purpose, just letting instinct guide him. They were years apart different seasons, different moments in his life. He hadn‚Äôt thought of them as connected before. Still didn‚Äôt.

But something about them, it stirred that gut feeling again.

Same unease. Same weight behind the words.

Like they were circling the same storm, without ever realizing it.

He let out a breath and pushed the thought aside. There was no clear connection. Not yet.

Just a feeling.

He put the folders back and returned to his desk. Ashley‚Äôs waveform still glowed faintly on the screen.

With a few quick clicks, he closed the project and opened a new  blank folder.

He started digging around online, pulling up case files, local forums, archived police reports. That‚Äôs when he stumbled on her name:

Regina McClain.

Murdered in 2018. Found near a drainage ditch just outside Mesquite. Gunshot wound. Purse still on her. No signs of struggle. No suspects.

Barely covered in the press. One article. One photo.

He opened the file and leaned in.

She was smiling in the photo, a hand resting on her hip. A blurred brick wall behind her, maybe a restaurant. Nothing jumped out. Nothing obvious.

Then came the police report. Sparse. A timeline. Witness statements. The medical examiner‚Äôs note.

And then, at the very bottom of the scanned scene log, something strange.

""Found torn scrap of paper in victim‚Äôs jacket pocket. Handwriting: unknown. Says only: ""He hears you"".

David skimmed it once, made a mental note, then moved on-too focused on timeline inconsistencies to dwell on it.

It didn‚Äôt mean anything. Probably someone else‚Äôs note. Something misplaced.

He clicked over to the map‚Äîmarked the scene.

Then closed the file for the night.

The room felt heavier somehow.

He didn‚Äôt know it yet, but that torn paper was never meant for Regina.

Chapter 3: He Hears You

Year 2018

It had been quiet for years.

Not peace. Not guilt. Just quiet.

After the girl dead in Dallas the one they called Ashley he stopped. Not out of fear. Not because he felt watched. It just... no longer served a purpose. There was no thrill in routine. He already knew how the story ended.

They never caught him.

They never came close.

The task force was a mess. Faces changed. Files shuffled. Interest died faster than the girls did.

So he faded.

New name. New job. New walls to hide behind.

But even in stillness, he listened.

Sometimes, in motel rooms or long stretches of highway, he‚Äôd scroll through newsfeeds or crime forums. Quiet curiosity. Nothing more. He liked seeing how far they'd drifted from the truth.

But one night, sometime in late 2018, the algorithm offered something new.

A podcast.

Unheard Voices.

The name alone made his jaw twitch.

He didn‚Äôt click right away. He let the title episode sit in his mind like an itch beneath the skin.

That name.

He remembered.

Not her face. Not what she wore. Just her name, caught in the back of his mind like something under a fingernail.

""Cassandra Serna"".

She had been one of the early ones. Before the task force. Before people started to notice.

He hadn't heard her name in years.

He closed his eyes and let the voice continue. It was near perfect recounting, some facts off, some pieces missing‚Äîbut it was enough.

Someone was looking.

Someone was talking about her.

That... hadn‚Äôt happened before.

He felt it behind his ribs not fear, not thrill, just the slow tightening of a thread he thought had unraveled; Something woke up in him.

He went back to his car.

Didn‚Äôt sleep.

By morning, he had a plan.

Her name was Regina McClain.

She wasn‚Äôt important. Not personally. Not like Cassandra. Not like any of them.

But she was near. She was easy.

She would be enough.

He watched her from a distance for three days. She had patterns. She walked alone. Laughed with her phone against her cheek. Ate dinner late. Always tipped well.

The night he followed her, the air was cool. She didn‚Äôt scream.

It was never about chaos.

It was about control.

By dawn, she was gone.

Crime Scene Log ‚Äî Mesquite, TX ‚Äì 2018

""Found torn scrap of paper in victim‚Äôs jacket pocket. Handwriting: unknown. Says only: ‚ÄòHe hears you.‚Äô‚Äù

He folded the note himself. Took his time.

It didn‚Äôt matter who found it.

What mattered was that it had been left.

Not for Regina.

For the voice.

The one speaking for them.

Chapter 4: Paper Voices

Back to 2023

The episode was live.

David leaned back in his chair, his eyes tracking the final upload bar as the Regina McClain case hit the feed. 

The numbers ticked up.

Regina's story weighed on him. There was something unsettling about the silence surrounding her death. Forgotten. Underreported. Almost as if someone wanted it that way.

He had nearly missed her name an accidental find during research. But now, her story was out there. Unheard no more.

He didn‚Äôt stop. The next case folder was already waiting.

Madison Rios ‚Äì 2019

A college senior, art major. Found murdered in a downtown stairwell after a gallery showing. No witnesses. No leads.

David scanned the crime scene details with only half his attention until one line caught him:

‚ÄúTorn sketchbook paper recovered from backpack. Handwritten: ‚ÄòPaint me in silence.‚Äô‚Äù

He blinked.

He copied the quote into his research notes.

""Strange..."" he muttered. It wasn‚Äôt part of the crime report. Not even mentioned by the media. Just... there.

He filed it away and moved on.

Deborah Ann King ‚Äì 2020

A warehouse night worker, 46, lived alone. Found murdered behind an abandoned theater.

David read the report slowly, bleary eyes, black coffee in hand. Then another line stopped him cold:

‚ÄúFolded note found in jacket: ‚ÄòThe Echo That Bled.‚Äô‚Äù

He sat up straighter.

Three cases. Three years. Three victims. Three lines.

He returned to Madison's case and Regina's and read the phrase again:

""He hears you""
""Paint me in silence.""
""The Echo That Bled.""

Unsettling. Poetic. Specific.

He opened a fresh document, labeled it: Found Phrases.

He didn‚Äôt know why yet. It was just a gut feeling.

He‚Äôd been doing this long enough to know when something didn‚Äôt belong. And these... these weren‚Äôt just odd flourishes. They felt intentional. Like someone wanted them seen.

But why?

Jessica Nguyen ‚Äì 2021

Quiet. Well-liked. Taught fourth grade.

She disappeared walking home from school. Her body was later found in a park.

David scrolled through the official report. Then he stopped:

‚ÄúMessage found on store receipt, tucked in her boot: ‚ÄòEchoes don‚Äôt lie.‚Äô‚Äù

David exhaled slowly.

""four"".

four victims. four years. four phrases.

He opened his note document again and added the new line.

A pattern was forming. The only connection? The lines. The tone. There was something deliberate here.

He turned his gaze to the wall of his office. The corkboard. The names, the pins, the timelines. His mother‚Äôs case at the center.

These women weren‚Äôt on that board yet.

Mia Bell ‚Äì 2022

Aspiring musician. Twenty-six. Found outside a venue she never made it into.

The final note:

‚ÄúYour voice woke me.‚Äù

David froze.

His voice.

That wasn‚Äôt coincidence.

It hit harder than the rest‚Äîlike a whisper through a locked door.

The others had felt like cryptic poetry. This one felt... personal.

Still, no context. No explanation. Just a line, buried in a police file no one had bothered to read twice.

David didn‚Äôt know what it meant.

But he knew this wasn‚Äôt over.

He saved the files.

Opened a new folder.

Chapter 5: The One Who Listens

It had been bothering him for days.

David stared at the document open on his desktop: five names, typed in bold.

Regina McClain
Madison Rios
Deborah Ann King
Jessica Nguyen
Mia Bell

He wasn‚Äôt supposed to think they were connected.

Different Counties. Different backgrounds. Different years.

But it wouldn‚Äôt leave him alone.

He leaned back in his chair, eyes flicking between windows‚Äîmaps, timelines, articles, police reports. A familiar symphony was building around him.

It had started as an itch. Now it was a rhythm.

The Method
All shot. All clean. All without signs of robbery or assault. All left somewhere public or remote, but late‚Äîjust late enough to be missed.

The Notes
Each one strange. Almost poetic. Cryptic. Folded. Tucked away.

He reread them now, the words echoing louder in his mind:

""He hears you""
‚ÄúPaint me in silence.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Echo That Bled.‚Äù
‚ÄúEchoes don‚Äôt lie.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour voice woke me.‚Äù

They weren‚Äôt just odd. They were consistent. A voice trying to be heard but not by the police.

By someone else.

David pressed his palms into his eyes.

""By me? No.."" he whispered.

He pulled up a digital map and dropped pins: Plano. Garland. Denton. Grand Prairie.

Close. Spread just enough to be missed unless you were looking from far enough away.

The kind of distance the Police wouldn't see

He started pulling dates:

Regina McClain : 2018

Madison: 2019

Deborah: 2020

Jessica: 2021

Mia: 2022

One each year.

There it was‚Äîthe rhythm. Precise. Controlled.

Not spontaneous.

Planned.

A killer with patience. With ritual. And now, apparently, with an audience.

He opened his research folder as he remember a phrase in one of the early episodes and found Natasha Lane-1995, one of first cases he‚Äôd covered back in the early days of the podcast.

He skimmed the files. That line. That terrible line.

‚ÄúThe silence is final.‚Äù

A chill ran down his spine.

A Seven phrase?.

The pattern was undeniable. Too tight. Too perfect.

He paused.

The voices. The clues.

This wasn‚Äôt random.

He turned away from the computer screen, his eyes locking onto the wall where his corkboard was pinned with case files; He reached over and grabbed a fresh piece of paper. With a red marker, he began drawing circles around the phrases. He circled the dates. The cities.

The rhythm.

And then the name hit him, sharp and sudden:

""The Whisperer"".

Not because he shouted. Not because he made himself known.

But because of how quiet he was.

How careful.

The Whisperer didn‚Äôt force his way into the world.

He crept into it.

Unseen. Unheard.

Until someone started listening back.

David stared at the name in front of him. ""The Whisperer"".

It felt right. Instinctual. The killer wasn‚Äôt loud. He wasn‚Äôt reckless. He had a pattern, a message, a ritual.

And for the first time in years, David felt like he was close.

But how close? and to what?

His eyes flicked back to his mother‚Äôs case file.

Had this been the same killer all along? Had the pattern existed before these women? Was his mother another name on a growing list?

David couldn‚Äôt be sure.

But one thing was clear: The Whisperer was Speaking. And now, so was he.",1,1751921621.0,story,0,1.0,False

**March 27, 2025 ‚Äî a date which will live in** `/var/log/messages`

Hey RedditEng,

Imagine this: you‚Äôre enjoying a nice Thursday, sipping coffee, thinking about the weekend. Suddenly, you get pulled into a sev-0 incident. All traffic grinding to a halt in production. Services are dropping like flies. And somewhere, in the bowels of the Linux kernel, a single mistyped character is having the time of its life, wrecking everything.

Welcome to our latest installment of: **‚ÄúIt Worked in Staging (or every other cluster).‚Äù**

# TL;DR

A kernel update in an otherwise innocuous Amazon Machine Image (AMI) rolled out via routine automation contained a subtle bug in the netfilter subsystem. This broke `kube-proxy` in spectacular fashion, triggering a cascade of networking failures across our production Kubernetes clusters. One of our production clusters went down for \~30 minutes and both were degraded for \~1.5 hours.

We fixed it by rolling back to the previous known good AMI ‚Äî a familiar hero in stories like this.

# The Villain: --xor-mark and a Kernel Bug

Here‚Äôs what happened:

* Our infra rolls out weekly AMIs to ensure we're running with the latest security patches.
* An updated AMI with kernel version `6.8.0-1025-aws` got rolled out.
* This version introduced a kernel bug that broke support for a specific iptables extension: `--xor-mark`.
* `kube-proxy`, which relies heavily on iptables and ip6tables to route service traffic, was *not* amused.
* Every time `kube-proxy` tried to restore rules with `iptables-restore`, it got slapped in the face with a cryptic error:

&#8203;

    unknown option ""--xor-mark""
    Warning: Extension MARK revision 0 not supported, missing kernel module?

* These failures led to broken service routing, cluster-wide networking issues, and a massive pile-up of 503s.

# One char typo that broke everything

Deep in the Ubuntu AWS kernel code for netfilter, a typo in the configuration line failed to register the MARK target for IPv6. So when `iptables-restore` ran with IPv6 rules, it blew up.

As a part of iptables CVE patching,¬† a [change](https://git.launchpad.net/~canonical-kernel/ubuntu/+source/linux-aws/+git/jammy/commit/net/netfilter/xt_mark.c?h=aws-6.8-next&id=ec10c4494a453c6f4740639c0430f102c92a32fb) was made with the typo on xt\_mark

    +#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IP6_NF_IPTABLES)
    +  {
    +    .name ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† = ""MARK"",
    +    .revision ¬† ¬† ¬† = 2,
    +    .family ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† = NFPROTO_IPV4,
    +    .target ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† = mark_tg,
    +    .targetsize ¬† ¬† = sizeof(struct xt_mark_tginfo2),
    +    .me ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† = THIS_MODULE,
    +  },
    +#endif

Essentially, when using IPV6, it registered xt\_mark as IPV4, not IPV6. This means xt\_mark is not registered on ip6tables. So, ip6tables-restore that uses xt\_mark fails.

See the reported bug #[2101914](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/linux-aws/+bug/2101914) for more details if you are curious.¬†

The irony? The feature worked perfectly in IPv4. But because kube-proxy uses both, the bug meant atomic rule updates failed halfway through. Result: totally broken service routing. Chaos.

# A Quick Explainer: kube-proxy and iptables

For those not living in the trenches of Kubernetes:

* `kube-proxy` sets up iptables rules to route traffic to pods.
* It does this atomically using `iptables-restore` to avoid traffic blackholes during updates.
* One of its [rules](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/proxy/iptables/proxier.go#L921) uses `--xor-mark` to avoid double NATing packets (a neat trick to prevent weird IP behavior).
* That one rule? It broke the entire restore operation. One broken rule ‚Üí all rules fail ‚Üí no traffic ‚Üí internet go bye-bye.

# The Plot Twist

The broken AMI had already rolled out to other clusters earlier‚Ä¶ and nothing blew up. Why?

Because:

* `kube-proxy` wasn‚Äôt fully healthy in those clusters, but there wasn‚Äôt enough pod churn to cause trouble.
* In prod? High traffic. High churn. `kube-proxy` was constantly trying (and failing) to update rules.
* Which meant the blast radius was‚Ä¶ well, everything.

# The Fix

* üö® Identified the culprit as the kernel in the latest AMI
* üîô Rolled back to the last known good AMI (`6.8.0-1024-aws`)
* üßØ Suspended automated node rotation (`kube-asg-rotator`) to stop the bleeding
* üõ°Ô∏è Disabled auto-eviction of pods due to CPU spikes to protect networking pods from degrading further
* üí™ Scaled up critical networking components (like `contour`) for faster recovery
* üßπ Cordoned all bad-kernel nodes to prevent rescheduling
* ‚úÖ Watched as traffic slowly came back to life
* üöë Pulled the patched version of kernel from upstream to build and roll a new¬† AMI¬†

# Lessons Learned

* üîí Concrete safe rollout strategy and regression testing for AMIs
* üß™ Test kernel-level changes in high-churn environments before rolling to prod.
* üëÄ Tiny typos in kernel modules can have massive ripple effects.
* üß† Always have rollback paths and automation ready to go.

# In Hindsight‚Ä¶

This bug reminds us why even ‚Äújust a security patch‚Äù needs a healthy dose of paranoia in infra land. Sometimes the difference between a stable prod and a sev-0 incident is literally a 1 char typo.

So the next time someone says, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just an AMI update,‚Äù make sure your `iptables-restore` isn‚Äôt hiding a surprise.

Stay safe out there, kernel cowboys. ü§†üêß

It runs 100% locally and was inspired by all of you!","**TL;DR: I'm a solo dev who wanted a simple, private way to have local LLMs watch my screen and do simple logging/notifying. I'm launching the open-source tool for it, Observer AI, this Friday. It's built for this community, and I'd love your feedback.**

  
Hey r/LocalLLaMA,

Some of you might remember my earlier posts showing off a local agent framework I was tinkering with. Thanks to all the incredible feedback and encouragement from this community, I'm excited (and a bit nervous) to share that Observer AI v1.0 is launching this **Friday**!

This isn't just an announcement; it's a huge **thank you** note.

Like many of you, I was completely blown away by the power of running models on my own machine. But I hit a wall: I wanted a super simple, minimal, but powerful way to connect these models to my own computer‚Äîto let them¬†see¬†my screen, react to events, and log things.

That's why I started building¬†**Observer AI üëÅÔ∏è**: a privacy-first, open-source platform for building your own micro-agents that run entirely locally!

# What Can You Actually Do With It?

* **Gaming:**¬†""Send me a WhatsApp when my AFK Minecraft character's health is low.""
* **Productivity:**¬†""Send me an email when this 2-hour video render is finished by watching the progress bar.""
* **Meetings:**¬†""Watch this Zoom meeting and create a log of every time a new topic is discussed.""
* **Security:**¬†""Start a screen recording the moment a person appears on my security camera feed.""

You can try it out in your browser with zero setup, and make it¬†**100% local with a single command:**¬†docker compose up --build.

# How It Works (For the Tinkerers)

You can think of it as super simple MCP server in your browser, that consists of:

1. **Sensors (Inputs):**¬†WebRTC Screen Sharing / Camera / Microphone to see/hear things. 
2. **Model (The Brain):**¬†Any Ollama model, running locally. You give it a system prompt and the sensor data. (adding support for llama.cpp soon!)
3. **Tools (Actions):**¬†What the agent can do with the model's response.¬†notify(),¬†sendEmail(),¬†startClip(), and you can even run your own code.

# My Commitment & A Sustainable Future

The core Observer AI platform is, and will always be,¬†**free and open-source.**¬†That's non-negotiable. The code is all on GitHub for you to use, fork, and inspect.

To keep this project alive and kicking long-term (I'm a solo dev, so server costs and coffee are my main fuel!), I'm also introducing an optional¬†**Observer Pro**¬†subscription. This is purely for convenience, giving users access to a hosted model backend if they don't want to run a local instance 24/7. It‚Äôs my attempt at making the project sustainable without compromising the open-source core.

# Let's Build Cool Stuff Together

This project wouldn't exist without the inspiration I've drawn from this community. You are the people I'm building this for.

I'd be incredibly grateful if you'd take a look. Star the repo if you think it's cool, try building an agent, and please, let me know what you think. Your feedback is what will guide v1.1 and beyond.

1lu5f7t,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1lu5f7t/does_the_ninja_cp307_coffee_maker_deliver_the/,Does the Ninja CP307 coffee maker deliver the ultimate brewing experience review?,"The Ninja CP307 Coffee Maker, known as the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System, offers versatility in brewing, allowing users to enjoy a variety of coffee and tea beverages without stepping into a caf√©. As someone who drinks both hot coffee and cold brews daily, the idea of having both options in one system piqued my interest immediately. After giving this machine a home on my countertop, I delved into its settings, brew styles, and little quirks to see if it lived up to the hype.

**Design and Build Quality**  
Featuring a sleek black finish, this drip coffee machine fits neatly in the corner of my kitchen. Its dimensions (10.01"" D x 11.81"" W x 15"" H) make it compact enough to avoid dominating the counter space, yet it's substantial enough to catch attention with its minimalist aesthetic. The inclusion of a fold-away frother shows the level of thought put into the design; it comfortably tucks in when not in use, which is excellent for keeping the unit tidy. The reusable filters for coffee and tea are a practical bonus, making the whole system more eco-friendly. However, weighing in at 11.73 pounds, moving it around requires a bit of effort, not a dealbreaker but something to consider.

**Performance that Adapts to Preferences**  
Whether you're brewing a robust espresso-like cup or preparing tea with just the right steeping temperature, this coffee maker delivers on versatility. With five brewing styles to explore ‚Äì Classic, Rich, Over Ice, Cold Brew, and Specialty ‚Äì I tested all five over the course of a few weeks. The Classic and Rich modes catered beautifully to my morning coffee routine, delivering consistently flavorful results. The Cold Brew option surprised me with its smooth and naturally sweet output, achieving this in about 10-15 minutes, much faster than traditional methods. Tea drinkers will love the specificity in the tea settings, which adjust temperature and brewing steps based on tea type. It‚Äôs as if the system knows exactly how I like my drink‚Äîsomething I really appreciated for those extra groggy mornings.  

**Check Ninja CP307 price on Amazon.**

**User Interface and Ease of Operations**  
Operating this fully automatic machine is blissfully simple. The button-based control panel came off as intuitive, even for someone like me who might skim through instruction manuals. The Smart Basket Recognition is an incredibly underrated feature; it senses what's in the basket (tea or coffee) and shows beverage-specific options on the display, which ensures I‚Äôm never confused about the available settings. That said, the plethora of features might seem overwhelming at first for someone unfamiliar with combination systems like this.

**Upsides**  
Here are some standout strengths of this device:  
- Offers tailored tea and coffee brewing in one system with separate baskets.  
- Brew sizes range from a single cup to a full 10-cup thermal carafe (amazing for guests).  
- Keeps beverages at an ideal serving temperature for up to 2 hours in the thermal carafe without needing a hot plate.  
- Dishwasher-safe parts (except the thermal carafe), making daily cleanup easy.

**Areas of Concern**  
While the Ninja Hot and Cold Brewed System is fantastic overall, I did encounter minimal issues while using it:  
- The thermal carafe, while excellent at insulation, is hand-wash only, which can be inconvenient.  
- It could be considered slightly bulky for compact kitchens.  
- Lack of a warming plate limits its appeal for those preferring glass carafes and constant, on-demand warmth.

**Competing Brands**  
I couldn‚Äôt help but compare this to the Keurig K-Elite and Breville Precision Brewer, two other popular options in the coffee-and-tea niche. The Keurig, as convenient as it is for single-serve pods, lacks the flavor depth and sustainability (reusable filters!) provided by this system. Meanwhile, the Breville offers advanced brewing customization but doesn‚Äôt come close to Ninja‚Äôs integrated tea options and frothing capabilities. Ninja CP307 outshines both in terms of versatility, though the Breville feels sturdier and more premium. On the downside, Ninja‚Äôs manual tea basket switch feels less fluid when compared to the ease of pod machines like the Keurig.

**Bang for the Buck**  
When it comes to cost-efficiency, this coffee maker offers excellent versatility and reliability for its price point. Considering it essentially combines the functionality of several different kitchen gadgets (coffee maker, tea infuser, cold brew pitcher, and frother) into one, it‚Äôs hard to argue against the value proposition. Is it the cheapest on the market? Absolutely not. But for the wide range of features, the investment seems justifiable, especially for households that drink both coffee and tea regularly and in various styles.

The only reason I even got diagnosed was because my parents snooped through my trash and found a receipt for hrt and in their twisted sense of reality the only explanation to me being trans is that I'm making an impulsive decision so they paid for my ADHD assessment.


The whole thing brought back memories of when I was younger and the same thing happened to me. Whenever I accidentally broke a glass or spilled something the whole house would erupt into chaos with my mother screaming at me and my father standing idly by with me being unable to say anything because anything I'd say would just get me beaten relentlessly. 


Thankfully my brother doesn't get beaten like I did although I suspect that's because his teachers at school would report it rather than any character development from our parents.


I tried to stand up for him by (very calmly but holding back tears) saying accidents happen and I'll help clean it up. My mom then proceeded to call me slurs and saying that we're both ungrateful kids and she sacrificed so much for us and we're such terrible kids who aren't careful and ""are fucked up in the head"" if we can't even do something as simple as set down a glass.


She then proceeded to go off on me about how I'm not part of the family anymore and how I should keep my mouth shut and if it were up to her she would beat me until I couldn't speak and how I'm a terrible person who's the cause of all the family's problems etc etc.


It's been 2 days and my mother is still giving my brother the silent treatment except for short bursts of screaming at him when necessary and it's been 3 years since she's been giving me the silent treatment on and off.",2,1751920363.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

I came to the US not just to study but also because I‚Äôve always been fascinated by American culture. So far though, Berkeley, Oakland, and San Francisco feel completely different from what I expected.

In my country, we grew up thinking of America as burgers, hot dogs, football, tailgate parties, loud bars with rock music, line dancing, cowboys and cowgirls, diners with pancakes and coffee served by a middle-aged lady in an apron, big cars, and people chanting ‚ÄúUSA USA USA.‚Äù I imagined celebrating the Fourth of July with American flags everywhere and songs like ‚ÄúProud to Be an American‚Äù and ‚ÄúSweet Home Alabama‚Äù playing while everyone eats BBQ and drinks beer. I thought I would see diners, strip clubs in Vegas, Hooters, and gun ranges but so far nobody I‚Äôve met here is interested in any of that.

Instead, the culture here feels much more international, cosmopolitan, and quieter. People drink zero-alcohol drinks instead of shotgunning beers or playing drinking games. People here are more into hiking, weed, EDM, k-pop, Bollywood, and boba than burgers, football, or country music. Lots of people are vegan or vegetarian, and more into international cuisine like boba, dim sum, bibimbap, sushi, Indian food, ethiopian food etc.

Even when my MBA class did a trip to Vegas no one wanted to visit a strip club. In my home country I grew up watching South Park, Family Guy, Mean Girls, the Office, and Hollywood movies about high schools with cheerleaders, big football games, rock music, and house parties. I thought America would feel more like Yosemite Sam and less like a European city.

I would really like to experience more of the stereotypical American culture I grew up imagining before I leave. Things like diners, football watch parties, gun ranges, country music, line dancing, rodeos, loud dive bars with classic rock, or even just an over-the-top Fourth of July party.

People in SF seem to like EDM over country music. I did like the bar West Wood in marina, but they were playing Taylor Swift over deep South country that has a hard twang and Southern drawl.

Are there places, events, or neighborhoods in SF, Oakland, Berkeley, or anywhere nearby where I can find more of that kind of American vibe? I‚Äôd really appreciate any suggestions. Thanks.",0,1751920336.0,bayarea,27,0.35,False

1lu53uq,https://www.reddit.com/r/decaf/comments/1lu53uq/a_tapering_schedule/,A Tapering Schedule,"I devised a caffeine tapering schedule in the form of a hand written schedule. I had previously been trying to just taper mentally, but realized I was making excuses and not always reducing the dose.

The tapering schedule is simple to make. Put the days and dates in the margin, and number them consecutively starting with day 1 at the top. You start with whatever your current dose is. I will assume you brew your own coffee at home. There is somewhere between 1-2TBS of ground coffee per 6oz brewed cup. With this method you will reduce the ground coffee by 1/2 TSP per day. There are 3 TSP per 1 TBS so if you were at 1 TBS per day, it will take 6 days to cut down to zero. (I realize that is not much coffee per day, but it's easier to illustrate using the small amount, also I'm in the middle of a taper and am down to about 1 TBS per day. :)) You start wherever you start...it could be 12 TBS per day. You still drop it by 1/2tsp per day. It's just going to take longer.

There are no headaches with this method. There are some mild cravings, and even some ego-driven bargaining, but they are mild since the daily reduction is mild. 

I heartily recommend tapering if you are not the type that enjoys white knuckle withdrawal ""muh willpower!"" style symptoms.",1,1751920200.0,decaf,1,1.0,False

I was invited on a girls trip with my mother-in-law Sarah, sister-in-law Ashley, sister-in-law Kate and Kate's son Trevor. 
I was excited to go on this girl's trip to be able to get my know women in my family better. 

Little background to the story The island we traveled to is opposite sides of driving than the US and the rental car places only allow one driver with their policies and so my MIL Sarah was wanting between my sister-in-law Ashley and I to be the ones driving I didn't want the responsibility so I let Ashley be the driver. 

Background of Ashley is also the princess of the family no one tells her no, no one does anything activity wise unless Ashley is there. she is manipulative to her parents to get whatever she wants, she is very book smarts and will argue with you, tell you all the time ""it's science"" 


Our first full day on the island we decide to take a ferry to another island we agreed we would leave at 8:00 a.m. in the morning on the first ferry and come back at the second to last ferry so that way if we missed it we'd have another ferry to catch to make sure we make it back to the island are hotel is on.

It was like any other time I'm with my in-laws I ignore the rude comments Ashley is always making to her family for example on this trip telling her mother how ugly her hair is or telling her sister that she's not that great of a mom to her son. We spend the day going to beaches and exploring the island we make it to the final beach we're going to stay at till we leave. It's about an hour before it's time for us to leave for the ferry and I've gone to the point that I'm tired and hungry and don't want to be there anymore so I decide that I'll go up to the showers get cleaned up and then walk around the beach walk till it's time for us to leave and everyone else is ready. my way of thinking is we're on a group girl's trip so majority rules. I finished in the showers and I'm walking out and I see my sister-in-law Kate storming up the stairs I go to check on her to see what's going on and proceeds to tell me. That my mother-in-law Sarah, nephew Trevor and herself are also done, hungry and wanting to head back. Trevor is also having a rash reaction to the salt water. So Kate was trying to get her son up to the showers to get him rinsed off and at this time Ashley was not wanting to leave. she convinces Trevor to get back into the ocean and not listen to his mother. Now I am over all of of Ashley's crap being rude all day now this.( Ashely always talks like this nothing new, no one in the family will correct it or stand up because it's not worth the fight with her) my feelings are majority rules everybody wants to leave but her. So I head back down to the water to go see if we can compromise. I asked her if we leave early now then tomorrow we'll make sure that we have food with us all the things that we need to be able to spend however long she wants to at the beaches tomorrow. Ashley starts to just fight with me and tells me how about I take the car and go by myself and you guys can sit in the hotel by yourselves tomorrow. We're going back and forth for a little while and I'm realizing this is going nowhere so I just walk away. I head back up to where Kate is and a few minutes later you see Ashley storming up the stairs with Sarah my mother-in-law trying to catch up right behind her. When Ashley sees us she starts yelling at us telling us how we suck and we don't know how to vacation I tell Ashley stop acting like a b*tch. It's just set her off more to start yelling at us she yells at us that we better hurry up because she's the driver and she's going to leave us if we don't get in the car now. We try to slow her down so that way we can rinse off Trevor so his skin can stop reacting in the meantime Ashley starts yelling at a taxi driver that we're going to need a ride because she's not going anywhere with us. 

Unfortunately we make it into the car with her and headed to the ferry on the way there she's yelling at us some more of how we suck at vacationing so I asked for clarification why do we suck a vacationing and she starts to tell us it's because Kate would not put her face in the water or  go snorkeling. Kate had gotten her lashes done for the trip so she didn't want to get her face wet and ruin them. This is where I start to get petty I turned to Kate and tell her Kate you don't know how to vacation because you don't get your face wet ""it's science"" so now Ashley starts attacking me and telling me how I suck a vacationing because I can't go swimming out in the waves with her. 2 months prior to this trip I got a breast augmentation so I'm still healing so going out swimming isn't the best idea for me. So I continue to be petty and let her know that I need to heal it's science how that works. So Ashley starts to get meaner I have dyslexia so Ashley starts telling  me how stupid I am and that I need to learn how to spell. So I reply I'm dyslexic it's science
It's got to the point now that I have ticked off Ashley enough that she has completely stop talking. she did not say a word the whole ferry ride or the whole way back to the hotel.

We get back to our hotel and Ashley starts grabbing stuff and packing a bag and leaves takes the rental car and is gone. My mother-in-law Sarah and sister-in-law Kate are trying to talk her down to get her to come back so that way we know she's safe. I put my feelings aside and be the bigger person I sent her a text letting her know that I don't have any hard feelings I can move on past this. I just wanted to be on this trip to get to know everyone better. And that I'd rather her be safe and that her side of the bed is open (we were sharing a bed). Ashley sleeps in the car that night refused to talk to any of us. fast forward to the next morning Kate and Sarah are trying to call her to get her to come back still. I head down to the lobby to go get some coffee when I get back Kate is on speaker phone with Ashley and I walk in to hearing Ashley talking shit on my kids. Going off on how awful my 1 and 4 year old are. My 4 year old is the biggest brat she has ever met and is just like her mother and it's sad that my 1-year-old is cute now but is going to turn out just like my 4-year-old and I, an awful person. 
This when is when I turn into full momma bear. I leave the hotel room to go collect myself. 
I come back in I find out Ashley is taking the rental car for the day and is going to do her own thing and has left the rest of us at the hotel to figure out our own thing for today. 

Fast forward to the next morning My mother-in-law Sarah has convinced Ashley to sit down and have a conversation with me and to apologize and make amends. The first thing out of Ashley's mouth is I'm sorry your children are such brats but it's the truth and someone needed to tell you. 
This is when I lose it. Ashley and I are yelling back and forth at each other fighting about yesterday leaving the beach about what time we had planned to leave for the ferries about how my kids have nothing to do with this and she did not need to bring then into it. if she has a problem with me she can take it up with me and leave innocent children out of it. 
After a few minutes I realize again there is no getting through to Ashley at this point I am so over how rude she is to everyone that I just say you know what you are just a f*cking c*nt. In front of my mother-in-law Sarah in front of my sister-in-law Kate and my nephew Trevor. 
I turn and apologize to Trevor for my poor language and that he has to sit here and watch the adults fight then I leave the room take my phone and immediately call the airlines to get my flight changed because there is no way I was going to be flying home with Ashley without getting kicked off a flight. 

At this point my FIL Josh has been brought into this whole thing and is now on the phone trying to calm the Ashley down and just try to salvage what's left of our girls trip. During this time I find out that my sister-in-law Kate and I were under the impression that this was a girl's trip but my mother-in-law Sarah had told Ashley that this was her graduation gift from graduating med school. 

Learning this information I can understand Ashley's point of view thinking this is her graduation trip so she doesn't want to leave the beach because it's her trip she wants to do what she wants to do. So I can let all of the beach stuff go. What I can't let go is how she talked about my kids. so is it my mother-in-law Sarah is the AH for not being honest about what kind of trip this really was or am I the AH for All my petty comments and rude language towards Ashley or is Ashley the AH?  


We are home from the trip. I left two days earlier than everyone else. My husband and I have decided to make the choice that ashley has no contact with our children till she can apologize for the things she said about them.

I'm from Balkan, where usually nobody knows anything about urticaria and they just tried to blame it on food allergy or skin issue.

Thankfully, after many sleepless nights, even 2 trips to ER thanks to the ibuprofen allergy that this mess created, I thought about something.

My girlfriend had H. Pylori and I had a bad habit of ""cutting"" my nails by biting them - I know, disgusting.

Long story short I had another trip to doc and insisted on doing tests for H. Pylori and of course, they turned back positive...

After one month of treatment (first 2 weeks I've used ospamox and fromilid mixed with nexium and probiotic), I'm now mostly hives free for 9 days.

1lu4znu,https://www.reddit.com/r/Screenwriting/comments/1lu4znu/having_an_extremely_hard_time_knowing_where_to_go/,Having an extremely hard time knowing where to go next.,"Hey there, I wrote an action comedy feature length script last year and upon revisiting it after a 6 month hiatus, I have a lot clearer vision on what is missing. However I'm still having a really hard time getting this thing to the finish line. 

When re-visiting my outline to create more cause and effect, it feels like act 2 drags and my story beats are not really clearly defined as I get closer to act 3. 

I'm an actor who has written short films in the past but a feature script is entirely a different beast. Multiple locations, A story and B story - and lots of things to consider. This shit is harder than planning a wedding. 

I think my **biggest weakness** right now is I feel like I don't know what the right questions are to ask myself to help me get there. It seems each new solution I come up with comes with 10 more problems. 

I just wish I had some mentorship and worked with someone with real experience who could guide me in the right direction, or ask me the right questions. I've read coffee break screenwriter, save the cat more than 10 times. 

I'm just up against a wall and I feel like I don't have the right tools to climb it. 

I have some cash and I'd be happy to pay someone for some one on one mentorship / counseling. I looked into a lot of writers programs here in los angeles and they all take place in a classroom setting. I think I'd rather just sit down with someone and have them guide me to a more succinct story. 

Does any seasoned writer or newbie have any recommendations? A huge goal of mine this summer is to finish this script. Something I've always wanted to do. 

I feel so close yet so far. 

My first act is strongest. 

Act 2a is solid, act 2b and 3 really feels mangled together.",1,1751919921.0,Screenwriting,0,1.0,False

I am seeking another beta reader or two for my first novel. It is a very dark psychological thriller with all the trigger warnings.!! Feel free to reach out if you are interested and aren't opposed to signing an NDA. Description is below:

Dr. Amelia Walsh has built her career profiling the minds of killers. But when the Bloodline Butcher begins terrorizing families across Albany, this case will test every boundary between professional distance and personal devastation.

In the shadows of Albany's suburbs, something is unraveling. 

The Bloodline Butcher's methods are becoming more savage, more personal, more desperate. And as Amelia races to understand the killer's psychology, she begins to realize that some hunts change the hunter more than the prey.

The truth is buried in silence. And silence, once broken, can never be repaired.


Trigger Warning: This novel contains graphic violence, psychological abuse, child abuse, institutional trauma, suicide, and themes of severe mental illness. Intended for mature audiences only.

Excerpt:

The disheveled thirty-eight-year-old man across from me started to fidget. Rubbing his hands together and shifting in the metal seat that was bolted to the floor. I know how uncomfortable that chair can be and just how cold it feels through clothing, the way the chill seeps through fabric and settles into your bones after hours of interrogation. His short brown hair was ruffled with strands sticking up at odd angles where he had run nervous fingers through it countless times. Dark circles hung beneath his eyes like bruises, evidence of sleepless hours under harsh fluorescent lighting. He had taken off his black suit tie‚Äîit now lay crumpled beside him like a dead snake‚Äîand his once crisp white shirt was now untucked and wrinkled, small sweat stains forming at the armpits. Bloodshot blue eyes darted around the room, looking everywhere but at me. Being in a precinct for more than twenty-four hours has taken a toll on Mr. Allen Green, transforming what was once a polished corporate professional into a man unraveling at the edges.

My observations from the last few hours have only been reinforced since I entered the room. Avoidance of eye contact‚Äîhe glances up only to quickly look away when he catches my steady gaze. Soft-looking hands with manicured nails, no calluses or scars that would indicate manual labor or violence, fingers trembling slightly when he reaches for the styrofoam cup of now-cold coffee. Slouched shoulders curved inward like a man trying to make himself smaller, to disappear into himself. Even his breathing pattern betrays him‚Äîshallow, irregular, the rhythm of someone trapped in fear rather than the measured control of a predator savoring the game. This man is not who we are looking for. He just does not fit the profiles I have crafted. 

This man is too ""normal,"" too transparently anxious. He has not exhibited any mental disorders, no delusional thinking or dissociative episodes, which immediately rules out Profile Two. However, he also has not played any head games, made no attempts to insert himself into the investigation or demonstrate superior knowledge. No charismatic personality offering help or trying to manipulate the direction of questioning. No signs of excessive empathy or curiosity about the victims that would indicate a desire to relive the crimes through our discussion.

Had family visiting and knew I'd be pulling multiple shots. So I pulled out the pressurized basket and got a brick of Kimbo for convenience and nostalgia. Honestly, it brought back nice memories of a strong coffee, what I used to enjoy before going down the specialty coffee rabbit hole. I used to use this stuff with our old Breville caferoma.

Funny enough it was my wife who noticed the difference most as we've been enjoying more light-medium roasts, and she's come to love more the experimental or fruitier offerings in her latte. 

She jokingly said ""this tastes like you used charred beans, what's the deal?!"" ....we both laughed because in the early days she was just happy I made her a coffee and wasn't too fussy, but hey tastes evolve!

We have great movie nights but normally it's at my place, hardly ever at his. So I thought it was unusual.  

 I was working late and asked if he wanted to come to mine instead. He asks if he can stay over. I say sure. 

He says he just needs a quick power nap and he'd be right over. 

I thought that was a bit strange as he doesn't usually nap. He said he'd been out partying a few nights in a row and was hungover. 

He arrived, we hugged,  had a coffee, caught up a bit. I realised he was a bit off but I thought it was the hangover. 

About half an hour into the movie, he's beside me on the couch and he can't leep his coughing and sneezing at bay. It's clear he's sick. 

""It's just a headcold"" he tells me. I remind him i have my one and only holliday of the year in 3 days and don't want to get sick. He says ""It'll be fine"" like I'm an idiot for worrying.  

I went straight to bed to avoid him and he went sulking to sleep in another room  

Next day he's coughing up a lung, red eyes , runny nose, sore throat, looking terrible.  

I said I didn't appreciate what he did. He said, defensively, that he didn't know he was sick when he came over which I'm sure was bullshit. 

I'm sure he was sick in bed before he came over. He's one of those people who can't stand being bored. He wasn't partying snd felt the anticlimax and wanted low key entertainment.  

Anyway I told him never to do it again and he left. 

Today I woke up with a sore throat,  runny nose etc and had to postpone my trip I'd been planning for months. 

This isn't the first time he's done something this selfish. But I actually thought he gave a fuck about me. We've been friends for years. I'm really struggling to forgive this one. ",1,1751919553.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Maybe you have, and you‚Äôre just too afraid to say it out loud. But I can‚Äôt stay silent anymore. I feel like I‚Äôm losing my mind.

It started about a month ago. At first, it was just strange dreams. Nothing out of the ordinary‚Äîeveryone has weird dreams sometimes, right? But these were different. These dreams felt‚Ä¶ real. Too real.

Every night, I‚Äôd find myself in the same place: a vast, dark, empty space. No walls, no ceiling, no sound‚Äîjust blackness in every direction. Except for one thing.

A thin black thread. Hanging down from somewhere far above me. Perfectly still. Perfectly straight. Almost glowing in contrast to the void.

And I couldn‚Äôt look away.

There was something about it‚Äîlike it was alive. Like it wanted me to notice it. And night after night, I would just stand there and stare, frozen in place. Until one night... I touched it.

That was my biggest mistake.

The moment my fingers brushed against it, the space around me shattered. I was suddenly standing in what looked like my apartment‚Äîbut everything was wrong.

It was a mirror version. Like everything had been flipped, reversed. Familiar and completely alien at the same time. The furniture was where it should be, but it wasn‚Äôt mine. It looked like cheap imitations‚Äîlike someone tried to recreate my home from memory and got the texture all wrong. The walls‚Ä¶ were breathing. I‚Äôm not being poetic. They were rising and falling, slowly, like lungs. Something was alive behind them.

At first, I thought it was just a dream. A twisted version of sleep paralysis. But then I noticed the shadows.

They didn‚Äôt move with me. They lagged behind, like they were stuck in time, moving slower than I did. They twitched and shimmered like something glitching out in a video game. And then‚Ä¶ came the people.

People I knew. Family. Friends. Coworkers. They appeared one by one. But their faces were wrong‚Äîdistorted, warped like melting wax. Their eyes were hollow, and their mouths didn‚Äôt move when they spoke. But I still heard them‚Äîwhispering my darkest fears back at me.

They spoke about things no one should know. Things I‚Äôd buried. Things I‚Äôd forgotten. They whispered secrets from my childhood, memories I hadn‚Äôt thought about in years. Each word felt like it was carving something out of me.

I couldn‚Äôt move. The air was thick, like syrup. Every step was a struggle. I was trapped there, night after night. And when I woke up‚Ä¶ I was exhausted. Like I had actually been there, physically. No amount of coffee helped. Sleeping pills only pulled me back in faster. Days began to blur together. Reality started to feel as warped as the dreams.

Last night, I tried to break the thread. I thought if I snapped it, maybe I could wake up for good. But when I grabbed it, I felt a sharp, searing pain in my wrist. I woke up gasping‚Äîand there were bruises on my arm. Deep, purple ones. Like something had been gripping me tightly.

But I live alone. I‚Äôve always lived alone.

I‚Äôm writing this now, half-asleep, drained, and desperate. I don‚Äôt know how much longer I can keep this up. I don‚Äôt know how long I‚Äôve already been stuck in this nightmare loop. But I do know one thing:

Every time I close my eyes‚Ä¶ the thread is closer.
Sometimes, I feel it brushing against my neck.
Even when I‚Äôm awake.

Please, if you ever find yourself in a dream with a black thread hanging in front of you‚Äîdon‚Äôt touch it.
Don‚Äôt follow it. Don‚Äôt even look at it too long.

Because I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to post again.

1lu4op9,https://www.reddit.com/r/PoweredByExperience/comments/1lu4op9/should_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker_be/,Should the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Be Keurig K-Mini,"Compact, stylish, and straightforward, the Keurig K-Mini is a coffee maker catered to a specific audience‚Äîthose who value convenience, space efficiency, and quick brewing times. I‚Äôve been testing the Keurig K-Mini extensively over the past few weeks and feel compelled to dive into its strengths and shortcomings. Whether you're a coffee aficionado or just someone who needs a caffeine fix in the simplest way possible, the K-Mini packs quite the punch for its size.

**Convenient Design for Small Spaces**  
Living in a modest studio apartment, counter space is a luxury for me. That‚Äôs where the Keurig K-Mini shines with its slender frame, measuring under five inches wide. The matte black finish blends seamlessly with my minimalist kitchen aesthetics, and the cord storage keeps my countertop tidy. Portability is another big win; transporting it to a friend‚Äôs dorm or even my office has been hassle-free thanks to its lightweight design. However, the lack of a water reservoir that stores multiple servings might inconvenience those who enjoy a second or third cup of coffee without refilling the reservoir continuously.

**Easy Brewing with K-Cup Pods**  
The one-touch brewing feature is hard not to love. Just pop in a K-Cup pod, fill the reservoir with water, press the button, and voil√†‚Äîcoffee ready in under two minutes. Whether I‚Äôm rushing out the door in the morning or craving a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, the K-Mini delivers consistently hot and fresh coffee. Compatibility with the My K-Cup Universal Reusable Coffee Filter is great for those who want to step away from pre-packaged pods and use their own ground coffee, though you‚Äôll need to purchase the filter separately.

**Energy Efficient and Smart Features**  
The automatic shutoff feature, which activates 90 seconds after brewing, is incredibly convenient for forgetful coffee lovers like me. It's a tiny but important addition, ensuring energy savings without requiring any extra thought on my part. This feature also alleviates the ""Did I accidentally leave the coffee machine on?"" panic I often experience with my bulkier brewer.

Check [Keurig K-Mini price on Amazon.](https://techieupdate.com/p/b07gv2s1gs/)

**Versatility and Travel Mug Compatibility**  
One thing about the K-Mini that I discovered while running late for a meeting is how well it accommodates travel mugs. Removing the drip tray lets me fit my tall tumbler without any awkward tilting. Plus, the drip tray holds accidental spills or overflows neatly‚Äîa nice little feature I hadn‚Äôt realized its importance until I tested it myself. However, other users might find the inability to control temperature a missed opportunity for customization.

**Highlights**  
- Ultra-compact design fits small kitchens, dorms, and offices.  
- Energy-efficient auto-off feature for safety and sustainability.  
- Compatible both with K-Cup pods and reusable coffee filters.  
- Quick brewing process ideal for people always on the go.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
- Single-cup reservoir requires refilling after every use.  
- No temperature control for customizing the brew strength.  
- Excluded filter for ground coffee adds to the initial cost.  

**Product Comparisons**  
When stacked against competitors like the Nespresso Essenza Mini or the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the K-Mini holds its own as a budget-friendly single-serve brewer. The Essenza Mini excels in espresso strength but demands a higher price, while the FlexBrew offers dual brewing options (carafe and single cup) but takes up significantly more counter space. The Keurig K-Mini stands apart for its sheer simplicity and compact footprint, making it unbeatable for small spaces and single-cup brewing needs.

**Bang for the Buck**  
The K-Mini‚Äôs price tag feels reasonable when you consider its sleekness, energy-efficient features, and compatibility with multiple brewing options. While it lacks advanced features like temperature control or programmed timers found in pricier devices, those aren't deal-breakers for its target audience. For a straightforward coffee maker that gets the job done, it offers good value. However, the necessity to buy a separate reusable coffee filter and the lack of included extras could sway frugal shoppers toward competing brands.

I'd pushed and broken the agreement we'd made to only be friends with benefits. 
I'd known I'd blown it the moment I'd put the picture of us up at the cottage last week.
She'd immediately started to withdraw.
Opening the door, I saw Jada under a blanket on my couch. 
I leant over and gently ran a finger down her cheek, and she muttered. ""Carter.""
Her words gutted me, but I had no-one to blame but myself. 
She'd been upfront from the start about how she felt about her ex. 
She loved him and always would.
Her eyes fluttered open, and she looked at me with the saddest green eyes, ""Bull.""
Sitting up, she rubbed at her neck.
""I'm leaving,"" she whispered.

I'd watched as Jada slipped out of the pub, my stomach had sunk, and my chest ached. This was my fault. I'd pushed and broken the agreement we'd made to only be friends with benefits. I'd known I'd blown it the moment I'd put the picture of us up at the cottage last week.
She'd immediately started to withdraw, so much so that tonight, she'd come in her own car rather than on my bike with me.
Avy caught my eye from where she was standing behind the bar, flashing me a sad smile when she noticed that I'd seen Jada slip out. Tilting my chin at her, I turned my attention back to the table I was sitting at.
I knew Gwen, the petite blonde that worked for us at the campsite, had a thing for me. I'd never encouraged it, but I can't lie and say that her attention wasn't doing my ego a world of good. I knew I wasn't a bad-looking guy but a lot of women were put off by my size because I was a huge whelp. Jada had fit me with her height and full figure. Gwen, on the other hand, looked like a doll next to me. Finishing up my beer, I said my goodnights and stopped at the bar to let Hawk, who'd been keeping Avy company between punters, know I was leaving.
""Night,"" I said, clapping him on the shoulder. He stood, ""You need me to come with you? Cairo and Bond are following Avy home.""
I shook my head at one of my best friends, ""Nah bro, I'm good going straight home to bed.""
He knew, though, that something was off. He stared at me hard before nodding, ""Okay, but if you need me give me a shout.""
Giving him a chin lift and a thumbs up, I ambled out to my bike, got on and started her up. I instantly felt better. Pulling away from the pub, I opened her up, and she ate up the miles home.
Before long, I was pulling up to the manor and through the security gate, waving at Skinny and Blaze who were on duty.
Parking my bike, I sat for a while listening to the sweet sound of silence. I'd seen the light on in my cottage as I'd driven up, so was expecting this conversation to be had tonight.
Pulling in a deep breath, I let out a huge sigh and got off my bike and walked towards my cottage.
Opening the door, I came to a stop when I saw Jada under a blanket on my couch. Her gorgeous auburn hair hanging over her arm nearly hitting the floor, her full pouty lips puffed up in sleep, her brow furrowed in a frown, and I was saddened to see that even in sleep she wasn't fully relaxed. She was so beautiful. Rubbing a hand against the pain in my chest to relieve the ache, I quietly took off my boots and walked towards her.
Sitting on the coffee table, I watched her sleep, knowing deep down this would be the last time I would have the privilege of doing this.
I sat like that for hours, taking my time saying a silent goodbye. As the sun rose, I leant over and gently ran a finger down her cheek, and she muttered, wrinkling her nose. I did it again, this time running my finger down her nose and across her lips. In her sleep she sighed out, ""Carter.""
Her words gutted me, but I had no-one to blame but myself. She'd been upfront from the start about how she felt about her ex. She loved him and always would. I'd been hoping for the same loyalty from her, but she'd given her heart away a long time ago.
Gently, I shook her shoulder and called out her name, ""Jada.""
Her eyes fluttered open, and she looked at me with the saddest green eyes, ""Bull.""
Sitting up, she pushed her long hair back from her face, grimacing slightly as she rubbed at her neck, stiff from sleeping on the couch.
I waited. I knew what was coming, but I needed her to say it.
""I'm leaving,"" she whispered.
Putting a finger under her chin, I lifted her head up, so she was looking me in the eye.
""Okay. For how long?""
""I don't know, until I no longer feel broken. I don't want you to wait, Bull.""
""I would,"" I promised.
Her eyes filled with tears that fell down my hand and onto her lap. Her lip trembling, she replied sadly, ""I know you would, but I don't think I'm ever going to be ready, and you deserve better than a woman who'd only be giving you half of her. You deserve the world. You're one of the best men that I know. And that says a lot about you with who I grew up with.""
Standing, she takes my face in the palms of her hands, tilting my head up to look at her. I closed my eyes at the sadness I saw reflected in them. She pressed a soft peck to my mouth, wiping at the tear I didn't even know I'd shed. Opening my eyes, I look at Jada's beautiful but sad face, listening to her as she tells me, ""Look after yourself, Bull. Don't close your heart. Out there is a wonderful woman that is going to put you first and you're going to be the centre of her universe. That's what I want for you. When you find it, grab hold and don't let go, no matter what. Okay?""
I nod before taking her hand and laying a peck on it, folding her fingers over to hold it in.
""Keep in touch, even if it's just to let us know you're okay. Be careful, and if you need anything, and I mean anything, Jada, you call.""
She nods, pressing one more peck to my cheek. I sit there as I listen to her put on her shoes and open the door to leave the cottage.
""Bull,"" she calls softly, and I turn to see her silhouetted in the open doorway, the sun rising behind her making her auburn hair burn with fire.
""When you're ready, you should call Gwen and ask her out.""
""Gwen?"" I question.
Jada nods her head, ""Yeah, Gwen."" With that she leaves me sitting in my cottage, my heart feeling like it had a sledgehammer taken to it and I bend over taking deep breaths, trying to stop the ache.",1,1751919210.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
