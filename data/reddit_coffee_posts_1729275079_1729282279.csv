1g6rhm5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6rhm5,Update on my girl’s $500 Yaris,"Some of you might remember I posted a $500 Yaris I got which I decided to sell to my girlfriend at cost. 

Well here is the final product! I 3-stepped the paint, replaced brakes on all 4 corners and replaced the two rear struts. I paid to get the interior cleaned because I couldn’t be bothered to vacuum and shampoo the seats and flooring. I ran a deodorizing spray through the vents as well. I also detailed her engine bay and cleaned around all jambs. 

In addition, I changed her engine filter and cabin filter. The cabin filter had two literal coffee cups of filth stuck in it and underneath in the fan. It looked like a mouse or something was nesting there? There isn’t an animal now though but maybe at some point? After removing the filter the real smell of the venting system came through which prompted me to deodorize the car. 

The car feels totally different now and honestly if you didn’t know better you might even think it’s new!! ",1,1729282212.0,yaris,0,1.0,False
1g6rgta,https://www.reddit.com/r/bicycletouring/comments/1g6rgta/hong_kong_to_hanoi_anyone_done_it/,Hong Kong to Hanoi – anyone done it?,"I'm thinking about doing this in January because it seems fun, and there's a bonus of maybe doing the Ha Giang loop at the end if I end up in Hanoi. And, to be transparent, eating copious amounts of Chinese and Vietnamese food (and Vietnamese coffee, mmm!) is enough to motivate me to ride a bike nearly anywhere, endlessly.

However... info online is a little scarce. I've seen a couple trip reports that are old/sparse on details and was hoping for a little more. Has anyone on here biked it, and if so are there any routes you'd recommend? Least annoying ways of getting out of HK? It seems like taking the ferry to Macau and starting there could work?

(Fwiw I have been to HK and Vietnam quite a bit, and China too, but never all in one trip. I have a Chinese visa and have biked in crazy places before (India next to elephants on a highway is hard to beat!).  My Chinese is very poor, but I can order dim sum, so between that and Google Translate I think I'll do ok.)",1,1729282152.0,bicycletouring,0,1.0,False
1g6rgqw,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1g6rgqw/i_21f_dont_know_if_my_childhood_friend_22m_wants/,I (21F) don't know if my childhood friend (22M) wants to have sex with me.,"My childhood friend, let's call him P, and I have known each other since we were 4-5 years old. Ever since our friendship would be really complicated since he'd always find a reason to fight with me. At the age of 12-13, he started insulting me but calling me ugly and so I cut off all communication with him. When I was about 15, he sent me a text asking me to hang out after so many years of not talking. That was the time where I'd hang out with his friend group who eventually told me that P has feelings for me. Out of pure shame, he stopped talking to me. I told him that I'm okay with how he feels but being 15 and dumb, I didn't really care much. Fast forward to summer 2023, he and I reunited again. I had learned that his brother had passed so I sent him a text giving him my condolences. I asked him over coffee and so we went out. He picked me up with his car after the coffee and took me to the usual spot in our town where couples would usually bang. He told me about his recent break up with his ex, showing me pictures of her. He was heartbroken and I comforted him like any good friend should. He proceeded to tell me that all that which happened when I was 15 was a misunderstanding and that what he felt ""wasn't really love, it was just excitement tk have someone close to him"". During the following days, P would constantly ask me to go to the beach together but, due to some personal issues, I always rejected his offer. At some point, I had to be honest with him about why I avoided going to the beach with him and we ended up fighting. I mean, he was driving fast and almost crashed his car twice, ofc I'd be scared to get in the same car as him TvT. One day, he called me over to his place and we watched Netflix. That's when he showed me a female friend of his and told me ""If you were to meet her, you'd get Insecure Female Syndrome cause she's hot and you're... you, I guess"" and whenever he'd accidentally touch my thighs or ass, he'd cringe and wipe his fingers on his clothes calling me dirty. It made me feel really angry, thinking that I actually AM dirty for any man. I went home, sent him a text about it a few days later and never spoke to him again. This summer, he texted me AGAIN and asked me out for a coffee and to chill at his place. However, when I told him that I planned something with my bf, he immediately cut off all contact with me and never texted me again. Now, I could be overreacting but according to the male prespective from my bf and a few of his friends, he was probably faking his disgust because he wanted or was desperate to bang and didn't know how to express it due to our bond. What do you guys think? I think that it's just pure coincidence but... idk lol

TLDR: My male friend would insult me a few times while we'd hang out and call me ugly, he used to like me and then told me that it's a misunderstanding and now that he texted me and learned I have a bf, he never texted me again. A few people told me that he wants to bang but idk what to think of it.",1,1729282147.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False
1g6rgpq,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g6rgpq/brim/,Brim,"It was mid-August, but the early morning and thick overcast provided a prominent chill this Thursday.  Dave Compensated with a long-sleeved shirt, sweater, and windbreaker combo; his wife would not let him leave the house with anything less. The semi-hot coffee in his Styrofoam cup slowly steamed into the crisp morning air as he leaned against his Ford pick-up waiting for the busy line of crabbers to launch their boats.  He peered into the coffee he had picked up from the local convenience store, “Delilah’s” just 10 minutes earlier. Although the store advertised the brewed coffee as “Best coffee in town! Freshly Brewed!” the coffee seemed to have a burnt taste, indicating it had been sitting out on the burner for at least a few hours. Nothing cream and sugar couldn’t fix, even though he preferred it black. Nevertheless, he savored the taste as he pulled another sip from the thick Styrofoam cup.  Dave felt a thin layer of coffee cling to his mustache as he drew the cup away, one of the few issues that came with such a fashion choice, but having a mustache, or “stache” as his son’s referred to it, really suited his aging face. 

He looked into the crooked side view mirror to help guide his windbreaker sleeve and rub off any excess coffee. As he wiped the remnants of coffee away, Dave admired the remaining spackle of black hair not only in his now fully grey head but also in his mustache. *Christ*, he was not only feeling old but also looking the part.  It was at least better than his friend and neighbor Bill Hatchers who lived across the street from him.  Bill was around the same age as Dave but had lost what was left of his hair about 8 years ago. *Ain’t that a bitch*, Dave had thought at the time.  

A squeal of old brakes pulled his attention up from the mirror. A truck and trailer was pulling out from the launch and Dave was now next in line to go. He popped the Styrofoam cup’s plastic lid back on and pulled himself inside the truck onto an old patchy bench seat. The launch of the boat had not gone as smoothly as he would have hoped, but isn’t that what everyone thought when pulling such a maneuver?  The awkward sharp curve in the boat launch approach did not provide any favors either when pulling around to back in, but Dave managed to pull it off as he had done many times before.  After successfully launching his boat, he parked the pickup in one of the many elongated parking spots nearby in the adjacent gravel lot - if you can call spray paint on loose gravel a “parking spot”. He didn’t bother locking his old pick-up next to other empty trucks in the lot, as neither did anyone else that morning and started his way down to the dock. 

The thick rubber brown boots he was wearing crunched on the gravel as he walked toward the dock, and then moved to a soft thud as he transitioned onto the dock’s surface where the boat was tied onto one of the many silver cleats. Dave bought the 18-foot aluminum boat from a friend of a friend down in Seattle about 10 years ago.  On his way back from the purchase he had also bought the Yamaha outboard engine, from somewhere more local, when he got back into town the following day. The boat itself had a single bench seat closer to the bow and a single swivel chair sticking out near the stern closest to the motor, for easier steering.  This left a decent amount of room in the middle of the boat for gear, a cooler - and in the case of this morning - crab pots.  Although the boat had no name painted on the side of the aluminum shell, Dave had referred to his tiny vessel as “Radar”, after his childhood German Shepard that accompanied him as a boy. Dave liked this name not only due to it being his late dog’s name but also thought the name suited the boat great for occasions such as this one.  The name itself gave good luck when looking for *just* the right spot to drop crab pots. 

He swung his leg over the side of the boat, being careful not to clip his boot on the crab pots stacked neatly between the bench seat and the swivel chair. He wouldn’t dare be seen falling into the boat or even worse, out of the boat, in front of the audience that was amassed at the top of the boat launch waiting their turn this morning. Dave swung his other leg into the safety of the boat and settled onto the cracked leather chair, placing his coffee in a crudely made cup holder attached to the rim of the boat. He then turned to pull back on the old, frayed rip cord on the face of the Yamaha engine.  With the first few attempts, the old engine sputtered, came to life, then died. The outboard motor could definitely use replacing. *Next year*, Dave Thought. Although he had been saying that now for the past two. 

The squawk of seagulls was starting to become louder and more evident as the morning started to warm even with the gloomy overcast. He yanked again on the rip cord, and this time the engine sprang to life, drowning out the above seagulls. Looking up, Dave threw up a wave to the old man patiently waiting to back in. With little effort, Dave swung the boat outward facing toward open ocean, then slowly drifted Radar out of the launch area. 

Brimmer Bay, or “Brim” as locals in the area call it, is one of the last places in Washington to open for Dungeness; and due to this, Dave never wasted a season.  This was his 33rd year as an active participant in the recreational crabbing season and he always made time for opening day, even in choppy conditions like this.  As he slowly moved out of the vicinity of the boat launch, the wind slightly picked up, as he pulled away from shore. Along with the wind, tiny swells and white caps were slapping the boat and kicking up sea spray which stung his already cold red face. 10 minutes later, farther out now, the waves seemed to die down a bit, giving Dave the go-ahead to throttle the 50-horsepower engine for some speed. The 50-horsepower engine was not necessarily “overkill” for a boat this size, but it definitely had some get-up-and-go when met with the right conditions. 


After 30 minutes or so, Dave’s field of view started to fill with a collection of red, white, orange, and yellow buoys which floated lamely along the top of the dark murky water, marking the first of the crab pots that early morning risers had set out before he had arrived. He began to throttle down as the cluster of buoys began to thin. The speed of the boat slowed as he passed the final remaining markers. 
Red, yellow, red again, and then nothing.  
He continued on for another five minutes until he could barely see the last red buoy he had passed.  “What do you think, Radar?” Dave asked aloud addressing the boat as if it were his childhood dog. But Dave knew - this was **the** spot. 

He killed the sputtering engine, and almost complete silence replaced the noise in his eardrums outside of the faint sound of seagulls in the distance and the small waves against the aluminum hull. This quiet could only be found when one was far enough from civilization. Dave relished it immensely; he even made the point of leaving his cell phone in the cab of his truck as to not distract him while he was out that morning. Dave took a swig of the now lukewarm coffee and placed it back into the crude cupholder.  He did not know, but that was the last he would be sipping the coffee this morning as what lay in a bucket in front of him would kill his appetite. He pulled over a sealed orange five-gallon bucket that read “Home Depot” and broke open the seal of the lid. The smell from what was piled in the bucket almost knocked him back.  
The refrigeration from the past two days should have dampened some of the smell, but the salmon carcasses smelled as if they were never frozen at all, and in fact, were in the later stages of rot. 
Now that Dave thought about it, had he even plugged the garage freezer in?  It had sat mostly empty this summer as he had otherwise no use for it.  He had unplugged it in July in an effort to be more “green” but in reality was just an effort to save some pennies on the power bill he probably wouldn’t have missed anyway. Cursing his past self, he began to flex his hands into his Gore-Tex gloves. 

As he reached into the now open bucket to start filling the bait box of the first pot of the day, something caught his eye off to the starboard side of the boat (or in other words, his right) about 10 feet away. A thin stream of small bubbles was streaming up through the ocean depths and breaking on the surface of the water. This was not unusual to see out in the bay like this, as it can happen from a lot of different factors, but what was peculiar about this was that it was not a continuous stream in one spot, but a few different streams coming up in different lengths sporadically in an area about three feet wide. Dave allowed himself a 10- or 15-second gaze at the phenomenon before he started back on his work. As he again started cramming the bait box with the remnants of what used to be salmon, he began to hear what sounded like a small dribble coming from the same direction as the bubbles. The sound reminded him of a faucet that was ever so slightly turned on leaking into a sink or bathtub, a steady dribble. He stared up again from the bait box. 

What was there now was more than a few thin lines of bubbles. It had now graduated into a growing number of bubbles coming up in a larger area, these slightly bigger than what he had seen before. 

“What in the world...” he muttered standing up from the bucket. Dave was not what you would call a tall man, but the new vantage point and angle allowed him to see better through the reflection of grey clouds on the dark ocean water. Standing up he had noticed now that the area in which he saw the bubbles was occurring in a much larger radius than he initially had thought.  The area had to have been at least 8 feet in diameter and growing. Not only that, but was the slow dribbling noise getting *louder*? Dave craned his neck without moving his feet to not rock the boat and lose his balance. Behind him, a newly discovered crop of bubbles was quickly forming just a few feet away from the other side of the boat. The look on Dave’s face had now changed from curiosity to dumbfounded, not yet scared but damn well nervous. With that, it only took Dave a second or two to decide that maybe this was not **the** spot after all.  

He sat back down on the cracked leather swivel chair, removed the Gore-Tex gloves from his hands, and felt back for the rip cord, unable to take his eyes off the collection of bubbles slowly growing around him. The area of disruption was starting to overlap where his boat stayed floating on the water. As the bubbles hit the bottom of the hull of the aluminum boat, the sound that was a slow dribble was beginning to grow so loud that it was all he could hear, the faint squawk of the seagulls and small waves he could no longer hear. His hand found the rip cord and tugged on it meekly to find tension in the line. Dave then took his eyes away from the unveiling scene around him, looked back at the engine, placed his other hand atop it to use as balance, and then yanked back. The engine came to life with a small sputter, which he could not hear, but felt with his hand on the engine, and due to the small line of cooling water jetting from the exhaust port indicating it was on. The noise from whatever was happening around him was now so loud that it reminded Dave of buzzing cicadas that he had heard as a kid when visiting his aunt Laurel in Arizona.  The cicada buzz used to be so loud that it would drown out the cheap Mexican landscaping that his aunt would hire during the heat of the summer. 

He looked up from the engine toward the shoreline that seemed so distant and tiny. *Why had he come out so far?* He thought regretfully. The distance from civilization no longer comforting Dave in the slightest. 

With that thought, he faced forward and throttled the engine. The initial sudden lurch forward knocked the coffee out of his cupholder onto the floor of the boat, and almost nearly spilled the still-open bucket of bait just at his feet. Dave did not seem to notice. 

As quickly as the boat lurched forward, it immediately stopped. The Yamaha engine had almost certainly died. “SON OF A BITCH!” Dave shouted. 

The noise grew impossibly louder still and the amount of bubbles hitting the aluminum hull began to vibrate the boat. The water around Radar now looked like it was coming to a boil. The vibration gave gooseflesh down Dave’s bundled-up arms and legs. 

Dave was no longer messing around. With fierce determination, he spun around toward the engine, snatched up the rip cord in his right hand, and jerked **hard** like his life depended on it. This time no stream of cooling water shot out of the exhaust port, indicating it was on, but Dave wasn’t looking for the stream of water from the exhaust port, he was distracted with what was now sitting in his hand. The frayed line that was the ripcord had snapped away from the Yamaha engine and dangled dumbly out of Dave’s hand that clutched the knob. Dave stood unmoving with a look of cold disbelief.  

It took a moment for his brain to kick back on. Snapping back into reality, Dave began looking around wildly in all directions for **any** indication of life. Looking for a boat to wave at frantically for help. But he did not see any boats. 
*Where was everyone?* 
He knew it was early, but this was opening day!  There had to be others out on the bay.  
Although there were others out that day, Dave did not know that soon after departing the boat launch, the older gentleman whom he had waved to, backed his large trailer and boat directly into the dock with such force that it dislodged the dock for any other would-be crabbers that morning. Later, the old man would blame the curve that led down to the boat ramp, saying “That it should not be so sharp!”. This reasoning would not ultimately save him from the fact he would be paying to repair the dock, but others did agree with his statement. That singular boat launch was the most popular not only due to its convenience but also because it was the *only* one serving the general public in the area.  You would have to drive 45 miles out of Brimmer Bay to the adjacent harbor of Awhauktoo Bay to launch, which many folks ended up doing that day.  One individual even remarked Dave was “one lucky fuck” as they watched the sole crabber drone out into the bay that morning, disappearing to a dot as they made plans to drive to the adjacent harbor.   

Dave patted down his faded jeans for the familiar lump, feeling for what he already knew wasn’t there, his cell phone. Radar was not equipped with a radio, it wasn’t used enough to garner such a thing, but Dave could not help thinking about how stupid he was to not bring anything except his fucking wallet and crabbing license. The mounting frustration came out as a loud “FUCK” almost involuntarily from Daves's mouth.  He was stranded. 

The now completely enveloped boat was jostling back and forth, making it impossible to stand without the chance of falling overboard.  Dave could imagine a fasten seatbelt sign popping up above him as he sat back down, a captain coming over the intercom, “Sorry folks, we are going to be hitting unexpected turbulence.  Please fasten your seatbelts for your safety until we turn off the light”. Dave braced himself on the engine and rim of the boat, waiting for whatever was to come next. 

The vibration and hum chattered his teeth. Dave clamped down hard trying to prevent his jaw from moving. Off to the right of Dave, a dim blue-gray glow could now be seen emanating from where the original batch of bubbles had sprung up earlier. At first, it was about the size of a small dinner plate, but as it grew brighter it also started expanding. The water slowly stopped bubbling and was now steadily churning as the surface tension of the water kept breaking repeatedly as if a submarine were rising from the depths. The noise from the bubbles was replaced with a low-toned hum that resonated with both the boat and Dave’s tense body. The slow-growing blue light was now the size of a large transit van, the hum so loud it began to blur Dave’s vision, making his eyes water.  With morbid curiosity and fear, Dave leaned over the side of the beat. Squinting hard Dave had a hard time discerning what was now only 10-15 feet below the water’s surface. The confusion was not only due to his blurring vision but also because what he saw made no sense. 

Large Interlaced silver rings spun below the boat. Multiple rings rotated counterclockwise and clockwise independently at a slow gentle speed. Inside of the rings appeared to be a cube-- no, a sphere *within* a cube, that was glowing with a bright blue light. Dave could not tell, but the rings seemed to have something etched along the outside of the bands, something not in any language he knew.  The low-toned hum seemed to be emitting directly from this object that lay below the boat. 

At the outer edges of the blue light that emanated from the sphere, Dave saw what had to be a large fish moving in and out of the edges of the light. Dave leaned further, his face catching licks of the roiling water, and tried to focus his vision as best he could. A large silhouette was cast in the glow of the object. The shape of the dark silhouette looked more humanoid than fish-like, although it had tendencies of both. Its elongated appendices jutting out from its unmoving body, bobbed in and out of the glow as they moved with the current. Dave could swear whatever this thing was, it could see him. He saw no eyes or face, but he **knew** it could see him. This was not a fish moving in and out of the light, but a person with impossibly long arms and legs. The head of the being did not look like a single head but something larger, the silhouette was dark, but he could swear the large oval-shaped head was staring directly at him.  Dave was frozen, staring at the creature in horror and amazement.  He tried pulling his head away, but his body was no longer obeying his mind.  A new noise had popped up, something coming from what seemed to be the creature. A loud moan was being broadcasted directly into his head, along with the hum from the object. The moan pitched up and down continuously sounding ancient and guttural. The moan seemed undecipherable, but in Dave's mind, a small phrase began to repeat. 
“WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME, WE HAVE COME”
Dave could not move his fixated gaze but could open his mouth to scream. His eyes now streaming with blood as he was forced to stare at the horror below.  

Without notice, a beam of light shot up from the rings and hit the left half of his face. The intense burning sensation slapped him from his gaze. The sudden jolt of pain seemed to grant his freedom of movement. Quickly reeling back from the scene below, he reflexively brought his hands up to his face, throwing him off balance.  Stepping back to catch his weight, his brown boot caught on the stacked crab pots. Dave started to careen down toward the edge of the boat, thinking for one second that he might be heading toward the dark water. Instead, his head clipped the side of the boat, knocking Dave unconscious and strewn beside the crab pots. 


It was dark when Dave came too. The feeling of opening his eyes to complete and utter darkness disoriented him, but his vision slowly began to adjust.  
*Had he dreamt of the events?* 
That thought slowly started to fade as he felt his face and recoiled from the touch. He was badly burnt. On top of that, he seemed to have limited vision out of his left eye. He stuck out his hands in front of him, closing his right eye he could barely make out the digits extending from both hands. The eye ached, but not as bad as his head and face.

A new thought came to him, *was he closer to shore or had he moved farther out?*  Pondering this, he sat up. 

He couldn’t tell from his surroundings; it was too dark to see the shore. He knew his better half had to have called the Coast Guard by now, but if they were looking for him, they weren’t looking in the right spot.  No lights shined on the horizon, no helicopter blades whirred, no boat engines rang in the distance. The only noise he could hear was a faint low-pitched hum. 

What *was* prominent to his dazed senses was an awful smell, the salmon from earlier that morning. Stomach turning, half from the odor, and half from the concussion he most certainly had; he threw the whole bucket into the water, which seemed to swallow up the worst of the smell. 

He dragged himself onto the bench seat rubbing his temple, avoiding the burn covering his face. 
*What was he to do now? Sit and wait?*
Dave was not too fond of that idea, but he almost certainly would be forced to do it. He scanned the horizon again, looking into the air for a helicopter, a plane, or anything at all. Would they be looking at night? He didn’t know. Dave couldn’t even see the stars that night due to the morning overcast persisting through the day and now into the night. 

Dave turned his focus to the low subtle hum that seemed to be a faint version of the hum he had heard earlier that morning. It no longer seemed to be emitting from the water below him. The surface lay almost perfectly still in the cool night, vastly different from this morning. The faint hum seemed to be coming from above him. Dave looked straight up. Squinting, he could barely make out the twisting of rings some 50 feet above. A frog caught in Dave’s throat and an involuntary whimper tried to escape his lips. 

Dave remembered now; *we have come*. He stood to his feet. 

“WHAT DO YOU WANT?!” Dave shouted, “WHAT THE FUCK DO YOU WANT?!”. Dave was no longer scared; he was mad dog angry. If he was to die, he would not die a coward. “YOU PIECE OF SHIT, WHA-”. 

Blue light began to glow from the object above.  The low-pitched hum exploded now, almost as loud as it had been before. The blue light formed into a circle, then slowly started to funnel down to the boat below. 

Dave froze, tensing up. He pictured the creature silhouetted in the dark water from earlier. The long arms and legs extended out from the dark shadow that looked up from the depths. Dave’s eyes shot down to the boat, scanning the items he brought along that day. He needed a weapon.

The funnel of light halfway down now, he scrambled around on his hands and knees, frantically looking for what he always brought with him. His hands found the small pouch tucked under the bench seat closest to the stern.  Ripping it open, he brought out a small pocketknife used for cutting line or small rope. Not the most ideal weapon, but it would do. He stood back up looking into the light. 

The light was almost touching his head, Daves courage began to wane. He shrank from the light almost touching his face. Feeling desperate, in a last-ditch effort, Dave decided to do the unthinkable, he dove off the edge of the boat. 

Dave closed his eyes waiting to meet the embrace of ice-cold water, but it had not come. He slowly opened his eyes; the blue light now fully enveloped him. He was staring down at the boat. His body was not moving toward the water but moving slowly up and away. He spotted the pocketknife he had pulled out laying useless in the shrinking boat below.

 A loud moan began filling his ears, pitching up and down, mixing in with the low-pitched hum. Dave hysterically screamed out, “PLEASE, WHAT DO YOU WANT?! GOD WHAT DO YOU WANT?!”

The loud moan projected a phrase into Dave’s mind as it had done before, and this time, he heard a voice along with the phrase. A loud guttural moan bellowed into not only his mind but his whole body. 

**“YOU”**

The light blinked out; the low-pitched hum was gone. 

Dave was gone. 

Radar sat idly on still water. A slight breeze now swaying the boat ever so slightly. The sun began to crest the horizon as the early morning dawn filled with the first rays of light.  The horizon slowly transitioned from darkness to a soft shade of blue. In the distance, the faint sound of a helicopter’s blade whirred.",1,1729282145.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

There are 28 people in my “year group” and 4 of us are in a close friend group and sitting the same exams. We are going into our third/final year. 

During the last year/ year and a half, one of the girls Emily (25F) has started to exclude me from the group and other activities. We all usually go out for coffee together at 11am and would go to each others desks to get everyone together. In recent weeks, Emily has individually texted the others to go for coffee together at an earlier time, she wouldn’t say anything to me about going. I would be at my desk and would see all my friends leave. When I asked later if anyone wanted to go for a coffee they all said no, they just went and thought that I didn’t want any as I didn’t come. I believe Emily is telling them that I didn’t want coffee. As I usually go with them for a coffee or for the walk.

In group situations, when I am speaking about a job I’m working on, or other work things, Emily would cut across me and make out that what I am saying isn’t correct or would cut me down and try to dismiss what I am saying. 

I also lived with Emily, our boyfriends (25M) and 3 other males during our first year. When my boyfriend and me moved in I was very clear with Emily that we would only be staying in the house for the year of the lease as we had plans to find our own house after. During work Emily would find reasons to talk bad about my boyfriend, saying that he was not clean, a mess, leaves dirty plates everywhere and doesn’t clean the bathroom after he showers. I am not being biased but my boyfriend is a very clean person this was not true. When Emily would bring this up with our work colleagues I was blind sighting as to why was she bringing this to people neither of us were friends with and with me being there, I didn’t know how to react. 

Emily and her boyfriend had been together since they were 13 (12 years) and me and mine for 6 years. This was not there first time living together. Emily would also belittle my relationship saying stuff like “well ye are only just going out, you haven’t been together that long” “it’s your first time living toegther so ye will definitely not get on and one of ye will want to move out”. She would say this stuff again in the office around friends and work colleagues. 

Recently, Emily’s behaviour has rubbed off on the other 2 girls in our group, Mary (F24) and Rose (F24). The girls know I go into the office on the weekends to study for my exams and they don’t want to come in to study and prefer to stay at home. 

One weekend Emily and Mary came into the office to study and were shocked to see me there, even thought it is common knowledge in our year group that me and Allie study in the office on the weekends. Around lunch time, Mary put on her jacket and walked out of the office without saying anything and 5 minutes later Emily did the same thing. When they didn’t come back I realised that they had left to go out for lunch. The other girl Allie had met a friend for lunch and when she came back she was asking why I didn’t go with the 2 girls for lunch. As this girl is a work colleague and friend, I didn’t want to cause any drama so said I wasn’t hungry. When Emily and Mary came back I asked them how was lunch and said I would love to join them if they want to go again. Emily said “ya, I was a spur of the moment idea and we had it Booked so we couldn’t invite you because it was booked”. I know the place they went too and I know what Emily said was bullshit as we would often have a place booked for lunch but if there was someone else in our year group in, Emily would be the first person to invite them and ring the restaurant to change the reservation usually with only an hours notice. 

Much more things like this has happened and the people in our year group as noticing. Any time anyone mentions it, I try to brush it off so that no drama is caused as this is our place of work and we have to maintain a certain level of professionalism. 

I just don’t know how much more I can take, it’s horrible having to go to work everyday and then also having to study/do lectures with the same girls. 

Emily would ignore me in the office unless I am with someone who she wants to perceive her as friendly. When our group is organising social activities, she would tell everyone that I can’t go because of x,y or z which isn’t true and I end up not being invited/informed. There is also times where the year has organised activities and told Emily to tell me about it and she doesn’t. 

I really don’t know how much more I can take of this. It is making me feel extremely lonely and isolated, as I feel like the group of friends I have aren’t my friends and I feel like I can’t turn to the others in my year without drawing attention to the issue. 

I just want to know am I overreacting to the entire situation and making mountains out of mole hills? And what I should do about this? Should I confide in one of the girls, Allie, who has witness must of this happening the last 2 years, or keep quiet as it is a work environment and I don’t want to cause a fuss or get work officials involved ",1,1729281976.0,AmIOverreacting,0,0.99,False

Hi,
I find myself in an emotionally challenging situation atm and feel very lonely. I'm shy irl, I do have friends but they're few and are far away. I need kind, empathetic friends to talk to and not feel quite as lonely. 


When I'm not working, I'm mostly on my phone and am very responsive. Can talk about anything, life, experiences, interests, dreams. I open up fairly quickly so will have no trouble talking. All I want is to have constant companionship, friendship and support. I have a vibrant little world inside my head but in real life, I'm quite shy only until I start to get to know someone, after that, I'm a chatterbox.  I'm happy to talk about anything or everything. I just please ask that you don't ghost and if you lose interest, communicate. Someone closer to me would be better but I'm happy to talk to anyone. I just need a kind friend to share my life with. I'm looking for kindred spirits just as Anne had Diana and Gilbert ❤️


I have used this sub before and found my best friend on this sub and I'm looking forward to finding my community through this sub again. It is a good humbling experience talking to new people, understanding their diverse lives and sharing a snippet of our own. Life can be lonely but a positive mindset dictates that love and friendship is abundant and it is quite possible to find it if we keep looking in the right places. I never would've thought I'd find my kindred spirit but I did and I'm so happy but am on a quest to find more! I have a few kindred spirits in my 24 years of being alive and I'm sure, there are many others out there. 



For reference, I love reading, am a bookworm, journaling, going for walks, learning languages, passionate about coffees, learning new things, talking to people and nature. I love dogs, flowers, sunshine, old people, babies and anything that melts my heart. I've been told that I'm quite smiley with a happy face and I always try to make others around me feel warm and comfortable, I'm like a caring mum or a nan which also can be annoying to some. I'm emotionally quite aware and always I always analyse what I'm feeling and why. That's why I love writing in my diary too.  I'm also quite insecure in real life, self conscious and have self esteem issues but I'm working on them so if you're looking for someone quite perfect, please scroll down!

I'd like to meet a couple more people to penpal with. I prefer women only or non cis men. Basically not open to any flirtation or anything as can happen here sometimes. Just looking for a platonic penpal. 

I'd love to send letters and work on my cursive. Sending small packages on special occasions too, like Xmas and bdays would be nice too. But I'd be just as happy with getting more use out of my p.o with letters and postcards. I have international penpals now and I'm actually at the point where I would visit my penpals...but they're halfway across the world. Even if we never surpass letter writing or messaging, I like the idea of the possibility of something beyond that if it's mutually right (like having coffee someday or something). 

I'm a full-time student and am most of my way through my bachelor's degree. I decided to go back to school and it's been a really good decision for me. I love trying new things, spending time with my animals, friends, and family. I like to discuss a broad range of topics but like to avoid politics (but like topics like feminism and human rights) medical stuff, and negative news or world events. 

If you'd like to see about being penpals say hi, and share idk..what's the grosser thing you've ever eaten. Mine would be a bag of plantain chips for a health food store. It tasted like literal vomit.

I’m a guy and my gf is about 6-7 months pregnant. She suddenly stopped doing things she used to do and won’t initiate affection with me. I am wondering if this is a pregnant lady thing and what I can do to get her back to normal. 

She has been extra clingy and needy lately. It’s kind of annoying but I’ve let it go to keep the peace because I know she’s pregnant and hormonal. She kept asking me for verbal affirmations and stuff like that. I’ve had to correct her need for reassurance for most of our relationship. Something she had a hard time understanding is that she should see my actions as love for her and not just what I say. So a couple days ago she says to me that she “feels like I don’t like her very much”. Obviously I was mad about that because nobody is going to respond well to hearing that. And I told her that I do all these things for HER. I go to work at a demanding job and pay OVER half the rent (which is BS I put up with because she thinks I should pay more just because I make twice as much), and I help her with dishes and I bring HER kids candy. I brought her flowers for our anniversary. Her whole reasoning seemed to boil down to me being “dismissive” (no self respecting man is going to sit and listen to accusations, I’m sorry I’m not a simp), I won’t post about her or our baby on social media and I haven’t introduced her to my family. The family one makes sense, but I am not close with my family and I don’t want my family asking us things like when we are getting married.  It’s bad enough I’m having a child with her out of wedlock, and I don’t want to answer those questions because I don’t know if I want to marry her yet and I’ve explained that to her.  I did post her on my stories in March so that’s nonsense. I reminded her that it’s not healthy for her to constantly need reassurance like this, and all my actions should tell her I like and love her. 

I may have been the asshole at the end because I told her I would post a picture of us together and I’d schedule a FaceTime with my mom. I needed her to stop talking and let me sleep, I had work the next day. I don’t intend to do that because I already told her my boundary on those things.  

We have had this conversation a few times and she always understands that she needs to take care of her emotions herself and I do a lot of things for her. I’m fixing a lot of things her ex husband broke around the house and I pay for dinner every time we go out. I DO show her I love her.  

The next morning, she told me her pregnancy has been hurting her pelvis a lot more. I told her she should go to the doctor. And she’s been very cold to me since. She didn’t make my coffee or send me a text while I was at work, which she does every other day. I tried to do what she wanted and I told her while I was at lunch that I hope she’s having a good day. All she said was “you too”. I tried to let it go, but when I got home she didn’t even get up to greet me. She was just laying on the couch and flatly asked how work was. I was tired from her keeping me up all night so I went to bed. When she came in I told her if she wanted to snuggle I can snuggle for a little while but I need to rest for work. She was cold about that too. 

I know it’s hard being pregnant. I’m not an asshole, I help her out more and I don’t complain when dinner is bland for her heartburn. I want her to have an easy time. But she makes everything so difficult with her toxic behavior. 

I want to be a good father to our son, but how long is this going to last? I can be patient because she is pregnant but she needs to figure it out because being cold to me is out of line. If it is a hormones thing, I’ll forgive it.

My regular snacks I'm bringing to work lately have been chobani's less sugar options, a packaged sargento balanced break and an apple, but sometimes it doesn't satisfy so I'd sometimes go get fast food.

I took photos over the past weekend using a mirrorless camera that doesn’t have GPS functionality. That means there was no location metadata.


I used Apple’s USB-C to SD card reader to dump the photos from the camera’s SD card to my iPad Pro - they were dumped to & stored on Apple’s standard Photos app.


I then added the location using ‘Adjust Location’ within Photos. I typed in the exact location, and clicked the (accurate) result that came up. For example, some photos were taken of a painted mural at a specific coffee shop - typing the name of the coffee shop into the Adjust Location interface brought up the coffee shop’s address, so I clicked that as the location I wanted to add.


However, after finalizing that adjustment, when viewing the photo, the location is tagged as a general location - the college campus that’s nearby. I don’t know if the coffee shop has any affiliation with the college, but even so, I want the tag to show the coffee shop specifically. If someone asks me “where did you take that photo?,” I need to be able to reply with the coffee shop’s name, because if I just said the college’s name, that’s extremely vague, and that person could end up not finding it - leading to their frustration, and/or possibly not believing I took the photo, or at least took it where I said I did…


I can’t just rely on my memory to know the exact location of my photographs, especially as I obviously want to visit more places.


Is there any way to ‘force’ Photos to maintain the actual location I manually input, or is this ‘just the way it works?’

Set in The Adirondack Mountains with cozy mountain vibes, bookstores, morning coffee and sex on nature hikes. I loved all the descriptive nuances to cozy things in this book including turning on a heater in a cold room on a snowy day amongst the silence of snowfall. 

Ideally I’d be looking for something like that and The Notebook. Beautifully written imagery. Painting and canoeing on acres of land with sit on the front porch and stare at the trees vibes. Laying in the middle of the road staring at the stars kind of thing. 

With that being said, I also prefer the protagonists to be in their 40s. Mid to late 30’s is fine too. ",1,1729280920.0,suggestmeabook,0,1.0,False

In consideration that:

Neil Gaiman has been credibly accused of sexual assault by multiple women;

And,

These allegations, even after being covered by credible outlets, seem to be virtually unknown outside of a small segment of fandom even after 3 months;

And,

An opportunity is about to be missed to educate and protect fandom from future exploitation by predatory artists;

I offer this plan of action to raise awareness about the allegations among both fandom and the general public. Take from it what makes sense, leave the rest or put your own spin on it. And surely add/improve anything in comments.

*( I know many of us already know how to do this. But I suspect many of the younger crowd either doesn’t or hasn’t had it spelled out. So go easy).*

1. Making Print Media
2. Distribution
3. Archiving
4. Hashtags

NOTE: *Always keep in mind by exposing NG actions you are making yourselves a target for NG supporters including Scientology, and his PR firm Edendale Strategies (Hi! \* waves \* ). Assume at all times anything your publish publicly is available to these people. Consequently, make a choice about how much IRL information you want to have connected to theses activities. It’s not about us; it’s about informing the public and protecting fandom. There is a reason that “other group” used a specific name.*



Just because we’re all on computers doesn’t mean everyone comes to the table with the same skillset. If you already know graphics you can skip this and go to Distribution. There are also tutorials and Youtube videos out there.



**1. Making Print Media:**  Bookmarks, fliers, etc

There are a lot of printers that have templates for bookmarks and fliers. But for the purposes of activism its good enough to keep it simple: 4 to 6 bookmarks cut from 8.5 x11, as large as you want; and half or quarter-page fliers.

If you go for a template, these can be used in most programs: import, make a layer(s), then export the finished product when done. It’s best to work on a large high resolution image to scale down and copy/paste into the template. Remember lines need to be thick and avoid narrow fonts that will disappear when reduced.

You don’t have to stick to a printer’s template; if you’re willing to do the cuts yourself with card stock, bookmarks can be wider. Also, bookmarks doesn’t have to be functional, ie, on card stock. That can save costs. Consider staying greyscale. Another savings, though it won’t pop as much as full color. An effective mix is low saturation, with text highlighted in color. But you’ll still pay for full color.

Printers:

Programs: Adobe Photoshop is popular, but also expensive (and a memory hog even if you get it from the “high seas”.) GIMP is a free open source alternative. Though frankly anything you already know how to use efficiently NOW is the best. Hopefully not MSPaint? Great for cropping screens, but that’s it IMO. But if it works, that’s what counts!

Content: Luckily there’s a ton of ready made content and meme already available online, on Xitter, etc.

For information to include, we all know this link:

[https://muccamukk.dreamwidth.org/1678972.html](https://muccamukk.dreamwidth.org/1678972.html)

The challenge is transforming them into a format that will look good and readable on paper IRL.

Here’s an examples I threw together in my fevered state:

[sample bookmark](https://preview.redd.it/b9v0nulxhkvd1.jpg?width=2500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8dbd52311c6e99637016a59f7eaa34b7e08553a0)

Ideally I would like more info from the victims, but it’s a bookmark. I just swapped available images, moved them around and added text. The QR code links to more info.  Feel free to use this if you don’t have time to make your own.  Also the QR code , thanks to TallerThanTale:

**2. Distribution:**

Find your objective: local books/comic stores, comic/scifi conventions, libraries, even coffee shops if the scene makes sense. Post materials on boards, bookmarks into relevant books in libraries, shops, etc. Find local newspapers, city newspapers and look for contacts in the arts and entertainment section; email them with digital copies.

For boots on the ground, in the bookstore work: If you can get a posse together who wants to help. Make sure they are completely informed of what you are doing. DO NOT BREAK THE LAW. That includes trespass, vandalism etc. Check your local statutes if you’re not sure; stickers can vary wildly.

Keep in mind some of these laws can be weaponized against activists: for instance fliers can be called “litter”. This came up a lot back in the day. Usually only Scilons go that far, but considering who we’re dealing with…

If you already know owners and organizers that are sympathetic, by all means work with them to spread the materials and message. If you don’t know anyone, you have a choice:

1. Try to open a channel of communication

2. Just go it and explain/beg for forgiveness later

In an ideal world, #1 would be the way to go. But obviously that’s not our situation.

IF YOU ARE ASKED TO STOP AND LEAVE, DO SO POLITELY.

Consider a follow up by email with that organization explaining the allegations and your actions. Of course, these materials may be used digitally as well, or emailed to organizations. IN ALL EMAIL COMMUNICATIONS MAINTAIN A PROFESSIONAL ATTITUDE even if they blow you off.

A professional way to express anger:

“I am deeply disappointed (org) has decided to place the career of a sex predator over the safety of fans.(translation: You SUCK!)

**3. Archiving:**

Try to go out with at least one person, especially if you’re under 18. You will be able to act as witnesses for each other, and be able to record interactions if you need to. Take pics of your activities mostly for personal records; only publish online if/after all identifying information is removed.

EXIF Info: phones have metadata embedded in images: time, resolution, type of camera, etc. This info can be stripped by editing in a program, but the quick and dirty method of copy/pasting it as a new image, then saving, works great. The good news is most websites strip EXIF info from public view when you upload, but not all. Like Flicker. Bad people have been tracked down and prosecuted with EXIF info. But obviously if can happen to anyone. You can view EXIF info in most image programs.

The r/neilgaimanuncovered has over 1,800 alleged members. “ Alleged” because some of those are bots. Some just clicked because they support the idea in theory, and have already moved on with their lives. Others are members of CoS and Edendale (Hi again!) Some are trolls ready to mock the SJWs(yawn), and who knows how many sock accounts, for whatever reason. Once the numbers are crunched, this sub perhaps has about one thousand members willing to do the work.



***Still one thousand boots on the ground is no small thing.***



**4. Hashtags:**

Want to go social with what’s happening in your area? How people or media have responded? IMHO there is no cool “operation” name or hashtag that can beat



# #neilgaiman



Bring it home.

When you’re ready...let’s go.

I’m sure there will be a ton of new ideas, better art or whatever. This was burning in my brain while my brain was burning(fever). I might possibly have overdone it.

I met an adult woman, and she saw that I liked her, I invited her for coffee, she turned me down because she has a boyfriend, and from then on, a manipulative mind game started.

Every time she sees me, she greets me politely, with a big smile on her face, her eyes glaze over with happiness when she sees me, then there are days when she is totally cold, she won't even greet me, the woman literally looks at me and won't greet me, or if she says ""hello"" then it's very cold.

**We all have bad days, but if you look into the eyes of a man who is standing 5 meters away from you and you don't want to say hello, we don't know each other because we have developed an acquaintance relationship,and at the same moment you talk with them to other people normally**

When she returns such a cold look without greeting ""Hi"" I freeze and turn pale, I feel rejected, tricked, manipulative, **and when I don't greet her, then she literally comes up to me and greets me with a smile on her face, why such behavior?**

How can I stop this manipulative mind game from her?

**I noticed that she loves when I give her a lot of attention, then she blooms with happiness and laughs and enjoys it, and when I deny her attention, then she comes to me and then she literally wins me over with her warm smile and I give in first again, and I take over everything, and again nothing.**

**She embarrassed me once in front of many people, and I was embarrassed, after that I ignored her for a couple of days and then she came and wooed me again with her eyes and smile, only to get my attention when I gave in and got over it all.**"" and maybe I shouldn't have, I should have ignored her forever, maybe it would have passed better"" **and then she becomes cold towards me again. Her warm and cold game reactions drive me crazy**. Why is that, how can I defend myself, and I have to see her every day because I'm in such circumstances, I can't avoid it?

This games exhausted me

Any advice from an experienced man is welcome.

Thank you all in advance.

# My Own Use Case Study for HeyBOOKS as Beta Tester

Alright, time for some real talk. I was lucky enough to get early access to HeyBOOKS as a beta tester. Skeptical? You bet I was. But let me tell you, this thing blew my mind.

I decided to test it in the cutthroat world of self-help books. Used the AI to dig up a niche on ""productivity for night owls"" - not much competition, but decent search volume. Bingo.

Fed that into the book creator. 30 minutes later, I had a 150-page book that read like it was written by a productivity guru with a Ph.D. in sleep science. Added some personal anecdotes, tweaked a few chapters. Boom - ready to go.

Slapped together a sleek cover with the AI designer. Looked so pro, my designer buddy asked who I hired.

Published that bad boy on a Tuesday. By Friday, it had cracked the top 100 in its category. Two weeks later? Best-seller badge, baby.

Here's the kicker - total time investment was maybe 4 hours. No writing, no design skills, no tech headaches. Just me, HeyBOOKS, and a willingness to trust the process.

In the first month, that book pulled in $1,200. Not retire-to-the-Bahamas money, but for 4 hours work? I'll take it. And remember, that's passive income - it'll keep selling without me lifting a finger.

Since then, I've published 5 more books using the same process. Each one's making money. I'm eyeing up my first $5k month, all from a side hustle that takes less time than binge-watching Netflix.

Bottom line: HeyBOOKS works. Period. If you're serious about making money with Kindle publishing, you need this tool yesterday.

# HeyBOOKS Pros and Cons

Let's keep it real - no product is perfect. Here's the straight dope on HeyBOOKS, warts and all:

# Pros:

1. Massive time-saver. Automates the most time-consuming parts of publishing.
2. High-quality output. AI-generated content is surprisingly good.
3. User-friendly. Even tech newbies can figure it out quickly.
4. Comprehensive solution. Handles every step from research to publishing.
5. Multi-platform support. Publish beyond just Amazon for maximum reach.
6. Affordable. Cheaper than hiring writers, designers, and researchers.
7. Regularly updated. Keeps pace with Amazon's ever-changing algorithms.
8. Solid support. Responsive team if you hit any snags.

# Cons:

1. AI isn't perfect. Output sometimes needs human touch-ups.
2. Internet required. No offline mode for those with spotty connections.

Bottom line: The pros heavily outweigh the cons for most users. It's not magic - you still need to put in some work. But it's about as close to a ""push-button publishing"" solution as you're gonna get.

# How HeyBOOKS Dominates The Competition

Listen up, because this is where HeyBOOKS really shines. This isn't just another ""me too"" publishing tool. It's a complete game-changer that leaves the competition in the dust. Here's why:

1. All-in-One Solution: Most tools do one thing - keyword research, or cover design, or book formatting. HeyBOOKS does it all. It's like having a entire publishing team in your pocket.
2. Cutting-Edge AI: The artificial intelligence powering HeyBOOKS is next-level stuff. It's not just spitting out generic content - it's creating books that read like they're written by subject matter experts.
3. Data-Driven Decisions: HeyBOOKS taps into data sources that other tools can't touch. This means you're making decisions based on real, current market insights, not guesswork.
4. Speed to Market: With HeyBOOKS, you can go from idea to published book in hours, not weeks or months. This lets you capitalize on trends and beat slower competitors to market.
5. Scalability: There's no limit to how many books you can pump out. While your competitors are struggling to publish one book a month, you could be launching one every day.
6. Multi-Platform Domination: HeyBOOKS doesn't just focus on Amazon. It helps you conquer every major ebook platform, massively expanding your potential audience.
7. Constant Evolution: The team behind HeyBOOKS is constantly updating and improving the software. While other tools stagnate, HeyBOOKS keeps getting better and better.
8. Built-in Marketing: Most tools leave you high and dry when it comes to marketing. HeyBOOKS has powerful built-in marketing features to help your books stand out and sell.
9. Cost-Effectiveness: Try hiring a team of researchers, writers, designers, and marketers. You'd be looking at thousands per book. HeyBOOKS does it all for a fraction of the cost.
10. User-Friendly Power: Despite its advanced features, HeyBOOKS is surprisingly easy to use. You don't need a tech degree or publishing experience to create best-sellers.

In short, HeyBOOKS isn't just keeping up with the competition - it's redefining what's possible in the world of Kindle publishing. While other authors are playing checkers, HeyBOOKS users are playing 3D chess.

# HeyBOOKS Money-Back Policy

Alright, let's talk guarantees. Because let's face it - dropping cash on a new tool can be nerve-wracking. What if it doesn't live up to the hype? What if it's not a good fit for you?

HeyBOOKS has your back with a solid 30-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked, no hoops to jump through. If you're not happy, you get your money back. Simple as that.

This isn't some wishy-washy ""satisfaction guarantee"" either. It's a true, honest-to-goodness refund policy. You've got a full month to put HeyBOOKS through its paces. Create some books, test the features, see if it's really going to move the needle for your publishing business.

Not satisfied? Just shoot their support team a message, and they'll refund your purchase. No need to justify yourself or prove you used the software ""correctly."" They stand behind their product 100%.

Now, I gotta say - based on my experience, and the feedback I've seen from other users, I doubt you'll be asking for a refund. This tool delivers. But it's nice to know you've got that safety net, right?

So really, you've got nothing to lose here. Worst case, you try it out and decide it's not for you. Best case? You've just found the key to unlocking your Kindle publishing empire.

# HeyBOOKS Price

Let's talk turkey - how much is this gonna set you back?

The front-end offer for HeyBOOKS is priced at a very reasonable $17. Yeah, you read that right. For less than the cost of a decent pizza, you're getting access to a tool that could potentially generate thousands in passive income.

Now, there's a catch (isn't there always?). This $17 price is an early bird special. It's only available for the first 4 hours of the launch, starting at 10am EST on launch day. After that, the price jumps to $27.

My advice? Don't snooze on this. Set a reminder, mark your calendar, do whatever you need to do to snag that early bird price. Even at $27 it's a steal, but why pay more if you don't have to?

Oh, and for the real bargain hunters out there, they're offering two coupon codes:

* Use HEYB3OFF for a $3 discount
* Use HEYB5OFF for a $5 discount

These codes should work during the early bird period, potentially bringing your investment down to as low as $12. That's less than a movie ticket for a tool that could change your financial future. Crazy value.

Remember, this is just for the front-end offer. There are upsells available if you want to turbocharge your results. But even the basic package at this price is an absolute no-brainer if you're serious about Kindle publishing.

# HeyBOOKS Bundle Deal

Alright, big spenders, listen up. If you're all in on this Kindle publishing game, HeyBOOKS has a bundle deal that'll make your eyes pop.

They're offering a complete package that includes all the OTOs we talked about earlier. We're talking HeyBOOKS Unlimited, Done For You services, Automation features, Income Boosters, Traffic generation... the works.

Now, if you were to buy all these separately, you'd be looking at a total investment of over $1,000. But with the bundle deal? They're slashing that price dramatically.

I can't give you the exact bundle price (it might change before launch), but based on similar deals I've seen, I'd expect it to be around 50-60% off the total value. We're probably talking $400-$500 for the whole enchilada.

Is it worth it? If you're serious about building a publishing empire, hell yes. This bundle gives you every tool and advantage you could ask for. It's like buying a fully-loaded sports car instead of a base model sedan.

But let's be real - this isn't for everyone. If you're just dipping your toe in the Kindle publishing waters, stick with the front-end offer. But if you're ready to go all-in, if you've got some capital to invest and you want to hit the ground running at full speed, this bundle could be your express ticket to the top of the Amazon charts.

Just remember - bundle deals like this are usually time-limited. If you want it, be prepared to pull the trigger fast when it's offered.

# Who Created HeyBOOKS

Behind every great product is a great mind, and HeyBOOKS is no exception. This game-changing tool was created by Seun Ogundele, a name that might not be household famous, but is well-respected in online marketing circles.

Seun isn't some Silicon Valley tech bro or corporate suit. He's a guy who's been in the trenches of online marketing and product creation for years. He's launched multiple successful products and has a reputation for creating tools that actually deliver results, not just hype.

What sets Seun apart is his focus on user needs. He doesn't create products in a vacuum - he listens to what marketers and entrepreneurs are struggling with, then builds solutions to those problems. HeyBOOKS is the result of countless conversations with Kindle publishers about their pain points and wishes.

Seun's background in AI and automation shines through in HeyBOOKS. He's taken cutting-edge tech and made it accessible and useful for regular folks looking to make money online. It's high-tech made practical.

But here's the kicker - Seun isn't just a developer. He's a marketer himself. He uses his own tools in his businesses. So when you're using HeyBOOKS, you're benefiting from strategies and features that have been battle-tested in the real world.

In an industry full of fly-by-night operators and one-hit wonders, Seun is the real deal. HeyBOOKS isn't just another launch - it's the culmination of years of experience and expertise in the digital publishing world.

# When is HeyBOOKS Launched

Mark your calendars, folks. HeyBOOKS is set to hit the market on October 20, 2024. That's a Sunday, by the way.

Now, pay attention because timing is crucial here. The launch kicks off at 11:00 AM EDT (Eastern Daylight Time). But here's the important part - the early bird special starts an hour earlier at 10:00 AM EDT.

Remember what I said about the pricing? That sweet $17 deal is only available for the first 4 hours. So if you want to score the best price, you need to be ready to go at 10:00 AM EDT sharp.

Here's a quick timeline:

* 10:00 AM EDT: Cart opens with early bird pricing ($17)
* 11:00 AM EDT: Official launch time
* 2:00 PM EDT: Early bird pricing ends, price increases to regular $27

My advice? Don't try to cut it close. Tech issues, internet hiccups, life getting in the way - any of these could make you miss that early bird window. Set your alarm, clear your schedule, do what you need to do to be ready when that cart opens.

And hey, if you're in a different time zone, do the math ahead of time. Nothing worse than missing out because you got your conversions mixed up.

October 20, 2024, 10:00 AM EDT. Be there or be square.

# HeyBOOKS Support

Let's face it - even the best software can hit snags. And when you're building a business, you can't afford downtime or unanswered questions. So how does HeyBOOKS stack up in the support department?

Pretty damn well, actually. They've set up a dedicated support desk at[ https://fpsupportdesk.com](https://fpsupportdesk.com). This isn't some generic helpdesk - it's specifically for HeyBOOKS users.

From what I've seen (and experienced during beta testing), their support team is on the ball. We're talking quick response times, knowledgeable staff, and a genuine desire to help you succeed.

They offer support through multiple channels:

1. Ticket System: For detailed issues or questions. Usually get a response within 24 hours, often much faster.
2. FAQ Section: Covers common questions and issues. Good first stop for quick answers.
3. Video Tutorials: Step-by-step guides for using different features. Great for visual learners.
4. User Forum: Connect with other HeyBOOKS users, share tips, and get community support.

But here's what really impresses me - they're proactive. They don't just wait for you to have problems. They regularly push out updates, improvements, and new training based on user feedback and market changes.

And get this - they actually listen to user suggestions. I've seen features added or tweaked based on community input. It's refreshing to see a company that views its users as partners, not just customers.

So yeah, you're not gonna be left high and dry if you hit a roadblock. The HeyBOOKS team has your back. It's the kind of support that gives you confidence to really lean into the software and push for success.

# Which Platform Can HeyBOOKS Be Accessed

Good news, folks - HeyBOOKS is a web-based application. That means you can access it from pretty much any device with an internet connection and a web browser. No need to worry about compatibility issues or taking up precious hard drive space.

Here's the breakdown:

1. Desktop/Laptop: Works seamlessly on Windows, Mac, and Linux. Just fire up your favorite browser and you're good to go.
2. Tablets: Full functionality on iPads, Android tablets, and even Windows tablets. Perfect for working on your publishing empire while lounging on the couch.
3. Smartphones: Yes, you can even use HeyBOOKS on your phone. The interface is responsive, so it adapts to smaller screens. Probably not ideal for writing a whole book, but great for quick edits or checking stats on the go.
4. Chromebooks: No problem here. If it can run Chrome, it can run HeyBOOKS.

The beauty of this setup is that you can seamlessly switch between devices. Start a book on your desktop at home, tweak it on your tablet during your lunch break, and publish it from your laptop at a coffee shop. Your work is always there, always synced.

One thing to note - you do need a decent internet connection. While it doesn't eat up a ton of bandwidth, you don't want to be trying to generate a book on a shaky 2G connection.

Also, they recommend using an up-to-date browser for the best experience. Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge - all good choices. Just maybe steer clear of that dusty old Internet Explorer install, okay?

Bottom line: If you've got a device made in the last decade and an internet connection, you can use HeyBOOKS. It's all about flexibility and accessibility.

1g6qu5t,https://i.redd.it/2x9zixusikvd1.jpeg,Westward Milestone No. 2 REVIEW ,"Westward Milestone No. 2

Distillery: Westward

ABV: 48.5%

Price: $250+shipping

Info: An annual release created through a 21-barrel solera system



Nose: Loads of cinnamon and vanilla, cherry pie, buttered bread with blueberry jam, light orange zest, almost zero ethanol but the flavors just EXPLODE out of the glass. There's a slight earthiness as well. This is one of the most fragrant whiskies I've ever smelled. 

Palate: Wonderful and rich, carrying over the cinnamon from the nose but adding on a dark coffee note. Lots of vanilla and desserty sweetness. Feels quite oily on the palate. Cherry doesn't show up as much versus something more akin to a raisin. 

Finish: Long and full of vanilla and spiciness. That cinnamon just keeps going while the fruit subsides. Slight wintergreen as well. 



Score: 10/10 

This is easily one of the best whiskies I've ever had, and that largely has to do with just how intense the flavors are coming through. I've spent more on bottles I like half as much, so this is such a wonderful surprise.

In college, I have a classmate (~26f) who I'm interested in getting to know better and potentially dating if things went well. We've been in the same program for a little over a year so we're both somewhat familiar with each other but nothing outside of classes.

She is aware I am now single as I've  mentioned it to a few classmates and word got around (I'm one of four men in a cohort of about 30-40). Since my breakup, her and I have been having small conversations and texting a little bit here and there, as well as talking more during class. She seems really nice but I don't want to come off as being pushy, creepy, or trying too hard to make something happen.

My idea was to either text her over the weekend and ask if she wanted to go for a walk on a local trail to talk and get to know one another. Or wait until class next week, and ask her in person if she wanted to grab coffee or something. (In both, I'm not considering it a date unless she says)

#000 - Ground zero

Guess what? We’re all back. Back in this chaos that we call Formula 1, where people drive in circles, talk nonsense, and somehow call it “strategy.” Let’s get to it.  
  
🤷 Bottas Can't Do Sh\*t to Decide His Own Future  
  
Here’s Valtteri Bottas, sipping his flat white and growing his mullet while waiting for someone else to tell him if he’s still driving next year. Honestly, it’s like waiting for a bus that may or may not show up because Sauber management is off daydreaming about whether they want a Finn or maybe a pet rock in the seat. Valtteri says he can’t do anything about it – which is precisely the same amount of things he did in a Mercedes after Rosberg left. The man’s hands are tied tighter than the Sauber strategy. He’ll just keep waiting and growing that hair. It’s the only thing progressing at Sauber right now.  
  
🎉 Perez Isn't Retiring, He’s Just Retiring from Winning  
  
In case anyone was wondering if Sergio Perez was packing up and retiring in Mexico with a piña colada and some badly placed sombreros, think again! He’s adamant: ""I will 100% be here next year."" Yeah, Checo, we believe you – you’ll be on the grid, probably watching Verstappen on lap 70 while you’re still on lap 30. But good news! He’ll still be here next year, crashing, getting stuck behind AlphaTauris, and being the subject of endless speculation. You can’t get rid of Checo, even if you wanted to. It’s like Red Bull has a two-for-one deal: buy a Max, get a Perez for free.  
  
😱 Max Realises You Can't Win Every Race—Shock Horror  
  
Max Verstappen, Mr. “I Win Every Race or Break Something,” has finally come to terms with the fact that he might, gasp, not win this championship. It’s like someone finally told him Santa isn’t real. In this Austin showdown, he’s apparently lacking “quite a bit.” Which, in Max terms, probably means he only wins by 10 seconds instead of 30. Poor guy, must be so hard dominating every season. Maybe, just maybe, he’ll have to do something crazy, like race for second.  
  
🎮 Lawson Prepares for More Red Bull Games  
  
Liam Lawson’s back, ready to be Red Bull’s backup driver, sidekick, and coffee-fetcher all in one. Apparently, he knows Red Bull’s expectations are higher than Max's ego, but hey, the kid’s ready. What exactly are they expecting, though? Probably to show up, be fast, and don’t touch anything. He's like a guest at a fancy dinner party, hoping he doesn’t spill the wine or, worse, beat Verstappen. It’s tough being the backup; you get all the stress and none of the perks. Keep at it, Lawson—you might just get a chance when they accidentally switch tires between the cars again.  
  
⚔️ Norris vs. Verstappen: The Battle We Never Knew We Needed  
  
Ah, the big showdown in Austin! Lando Norris, who’s basically still a child, and Max Verstappen, who’s been winning since the dinosaurs roamed the Earth, are going head-to-head. Lando thinks he’s got a shot. He’s been working on this for years—building up the courage to tell Max to shove it, while simultaneously hoping his McLaren doesn’t implode mid-race. It’s like David vs. Goliath, but Goliath already has a few titles and a massive ego. But hey, anything can happen in Austin, right? Like maybe Max gets bored and starts playing Mario Kart halfway through. Lando might get a win then.That’s it for this week, you bunch of muppets. Stop whining, stop crashing, and for the love of God, stop asking about tire compounds. Let’s just watch the races and laugh as it all falls apart.

1g6ql0t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6ql0t,Already over or is there still hope ? (18M),"For the whole context, my hair was frizzy and dry from birth until I turned around 16 to 17. At that point, my hair started getting curly and thin, and it just kept on going. I knew about it, but I just assumed that because my hair turned thin and curly that it was normal until this year when it got worse. I've been using for the past two years coconut oil and castor oil occasionally but I started having a weekly routine for the past 2 weeks (includes letting the oils sit in before showers, massaging the scalp etc). I've also dropped wearing hats since I started getting remarks about em leading to a faster hair loss. 

Overall, I'm pretty much accepting the outcome even tho it's kinda bitter to admit it. I know I can't change my dna, but I've still done some research. I've seen stuff about hormonal hair thinning, which I'm guessing is what I have, but I don't think it matters at this point. Another thing I've seen going around is caffeine scalp massages and serums. Idk if stimulating my scalp with a cup of coffee for better blood circulation could help at this point either. 

That's pretty much it. Pictures below were taken (1 hour before the post) after a shower, progressively from wet to dry. The first lighting is very strong compared to the last 2, they were taken in different rooms, I apologize. ",1,1729279840.0,Hairloss,0,1.0,False

1g6qiyj,https://www.reddit.com/r/povertyfinance/comments/1g6qiyj/should_i_spend_money_on_a_nutritionist/,Should I spend money on a nutritionist?,"I'm having trouble understanding exactly how I need to eat, and I basically can't afford to screw it up rn. So I'm sort of panicking and maybe not thinking straight. I eat pretty normal rn, so it's sort of a wild situation.

I'm getting short term disability pay ($1500). Most of it is going into bills, and some to debt. I just got informed today that I have Pre-diabetes. My blood sugar is sort of abnormal. I am 5'4 and 130 lbs. I don't eat perfect, but I rarely ever have sweets (Im not a huge fan). I also eat pretty normal. Lots of beans, rice, chicken. I definitely could be eating more veggies though.

This is what I ate for two days, for example:

Monday:
Oatmeal, bean soup, cucumber with chamoy, 4 coffees (one pump of creamer), 2 sugar free energy drinks, and fajitas

Tuesday:
Oatmeal again, meatloaf, mashed potatoes (like a bowl of them), 2 sugar free energy drinks, 3 coffees.

I don't think I eat that crazy. I just eat a lot of poor people food. But I take antipsychotics, a mood stabilizer, and an antidepressant. I unfortunately require these meds to function, because I have bipolar 1 disorder (and I'm dysfunctional off meds, completely). I know some people are awesome and do well off meds, but I freaking suck. I'm great and high functioning on meds. Stable employment for years, great family member, reliable friend and great mom. But yeah, off meds, I just can't. 

But 2 of my meds are known to increase the risk of diabetes type 2, depending on the individual, sometimes significantly. 

My doctor does not recommend taking me off any of the meds. I'm just now recovering from an episode because I tried to get off of my meds, due to costs. It resulted in a month long medical leave, FMLA, and ADA accomodations. He says, instead, I need to be eating basically perfectly. 

He's just an internal medicine doctor. I'm waiting for a psychiatrist appointment the 15th of November. It's the soonest I could get in. My last one quit and idk where she went to work.

I've made better financial moves to make sure I can afford my meds. I'm in a place half my rent, for example. But I absolutely can not afford to go off the deep end again. I was stable for a decade before this episode. 

I am in a better financial spot, but besides the short term disability pay, I only have $495 left after bills a month. Some of it needs to desperately go into a savings. I mean, probably most of it. I dont have a nest egg after the month long leave and I have a small daughter. I have a lot of help from her dad, he's an amazing dad, but I am a single mom. 

So idk if paying for a nutritionist is the way to go. Or if I should be using the short term disability pay for that or more into savings. I'm guessing my insurance will cover some of it, but I'll need to call today. 

It's hard, because I'm going to have to spend more on groceries to make sure I'm eating as healthy as possible.

I do not want type 2 diabetes. About 40% of my family members have it, and it's horrible. Towards later years, there's all sorts of other horrible health issues, meds, and pain caused by it.

1g6qigu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6qigu,Serenade all suites Punta Cana review ,"Overall, a very relaxing and wonderful vacation. Not a huge wow factor but a lovely resort. However, this was my first time to an AI resort. 

Room
We got a junior garden view suite but I almost immediately wished we had gotten a swim up. The pools close at 8 and I would have loved more night swims. However, the view from our 4th floor balcony was lovely. There are chickens around and you do hear them in the morning, but it is faint with the door shut. The mattress was firm but comfortable. I liked the tub out in the room but I was there with my husband so no worries about privacy. If you go with family or friends be sure to get separate rooms or get real cool about nudity lol. I loved loved loved the giant shower. I will miss it very much! The toilet cubicle left a lot to be desired. It was function and that’s about all I can say about it. It really could use some decoration. Also I would have liked a light switch next to the door or inside. Several times I peed in the dark in the night just cause I forgot the light switch was near the room door. Lots of storage space for you clothes thou not a ton of hangers. Small room safe perfect for wallets, passports, and other small valuables. We didn’t use maid service much but they were through if a bit slow when we did. We requested extra blankets and they came quickly. 

Food
We ate at the marketplace buffet for breakfast almost everyday. Lots of bread, plenty of bacon, eggs precooked and omelette prepared in front of you to toast. Lots of fruit (pretty sure I’m ruined for all other mango now!) lovely pastries, decent waffles and pancakes. Smoothie station too! Decent coffee, though I liked the lattes from the coffee shop better. Ordered room service breakfast one day, same stuff as the buffet pretty much , but less variety. and it came quickly. 
For lunch we honestly skipped lunch most days but we did eat lunch at the ocean buffet twice. It was alright. There was a lot of seafood, expected! But I am allergic to shrimp so I was careful. But I did have a cheeseburger that was huge and honestly delicious! Pizza was just ok, I think I just love my hometown pizza best through. 
For dinners there are three reservable options, braseria (steak/meat focused), koi (Asian inspired), and gourmet (French I think?) we did not see enough on the gourmet menu to our liking so we didn’t eat there. But we did do both versions of braseria. One was a traditional steakhouse menu (I got a rib eye that was perfect) and the other was a set menu when you picked your appetizer and side, then they came around with 6 different meats on skewers to cut and serve at your table. It was a lot of meat but it was all very good! We ate at koi a la cart where I had general chicken, decent. We didn’t eat at the hibachi or sushi version. 
We also ate at the marketplace buffet for dinner. Honestly I was very pleased with the buffets overall here, they were well stocked, staffed, and had good food. 

Pools and beach
I spent most of my time down by the pool with the swim up bar. That’s where most people were so it was good for people watching. I tipped the walking waitress every time she brought me a drink and she started bringing me two mimosas at a time 😁 I also enjoyed getting mudslides and just plain champagne. I tried the painkiller but it was really sweeet. The last day when I didn’t want to drink I sat at the quiet pool near the lobby which was also very nice. Still drink service here thou too. 
I only went on the beach one day, I just preferred the pools. I went on the water and it was nice but i have an irrational fear of seaweed/ not being able to see clearly… so not my jam hahah. 
There were bathrooms right by the pool but they smelled really really bad. Eh they’re bathrooms I guess. But yeah, ew. 
We’re not much for night life so can’t really speak to that. But if you have any questions feel free to ask! ",8,1729279658.0,AllInclusiveResorts,1,0.9,False

1g6qdjn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gastritis/comments/1g6qdjn/bile_gall_induced_gastritis_post_pylori_need/,"Bile (gall?) induced gastritis, post pylori; need direction and advice","Young male, healthy diet. A year ago I got helicobacter pylori. Last December I underwent a gastroscopy which revealed hpylori, along with notable high amounts of yellow bile.

(I'm not natively English, so I'm not sure if ""gall"" refers to this bile. I'll be only saying bile in this post.)

I went through quad to eradicate pylori, and successfully did. A breath test in April confirmed it, and another recent gastroscopy also confirmed that hpylori (urea) is negative. Also, after this quad in December I only took ppi for one whole month. Also worth noting that there were no ulcers in my stomach.

I still felt pain this entire year, although not as strong as during the pylori infection, and without other of it's symptoms, however things like pain after eating fatty food, difficulty passing stool, stomach rumblings were still present. Gastritis of course persists. I do not have heartburn/acid reflux, or have it very rarely.

This recent gastroscopy (done this month) confirmed that the yellow bile is present, and the stomach lining seems to be inflamed. Therefore, I don't know what could be the cause of it, and how am I supposed to proceed. I can't exactly afford a specialist right now so I'm left with google and reddit.

My diet is pretty much just white bread, white meat, vegetables out the pack, an occassional piece of chocolate. No coffee. No soft drinks. No alcohol, cigarettes, etc. For a month in the Summer I tried going zero gluten and zero sweets but there was no change whatsoever in how I was feeling.",1,1729279304.0,Gastritis,2,1.0,False

1g6qc9b,https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/comments/1g6qc9b/starting_a_very_early_crossfire_treatment_this/,Starting a very early crossfire treatment this Sunday. Will update this thread with results.,"Original post: https://www.reddit.com/r/Bedbugs/s/pbSM6PhI6f

To be very clear we have not seen any physical evidence, but my fiance got bit like 30 times at a hotel a few weeks back. All zigzag and all very puffy and itchy. We didn't notice until we came home for a night. I stress probably more than I should and I realize that these bugs don't transfer diseases and ultimately they are just annoying, but I can't help but panic a little bit. What will people think? Will people judge me? What if I infect others? Etc etc I know it's illogical.

We got bit again a couple nights ago. So I assume I took a few home. This has never happened before and I don't screw around, so I bought a ton of supplies, and here is my regimen come Sunday. I'm hoping one day and one treatment is all we need. I watched a lot of the green acre vieeos. After a few weeks I will update the body of this thread with ongoing results. We live in a 1 bedroom 1 bathroom apartment for reference. I was originally going to use cimexa, but I'm not entirely sure it's worth it in this instance even if used in conjunction with crossfire. I still haven't seen a live bug no matter how hard I look, so I assume whatever we have is a very light infestation.

-preemptively I already threw out our pillows and bought new ones. Our old ones had rips in them where I assume bugs could climb in and live inside the cotton fluff. So they went straight in the dumpster.

-Bag all laundry and sheets/comforters and wash on high heat, steam whatever can't be washed with a steamer thoroughly. Bags included.

-move our cat into our bathroom with a towel jamming the underside of the door. Sorry kitty. Have some toys.

-move everything away from the walls. 

-Vacuum everything I can, even where the carpets meet the walls and immediately dispose of whatever is in the container and leave outside for a bit.

-mix up 13oz of crossfire concentrate with warm water in a 1 gallon pump sprayer.

-tear apart the bedframe and treat all of it, treat mattress seams, treat where the carpets meet the walls, window frames, corners of walls, behind and inside cracks and crevices of upturned furniture. Bedroom and living room. I'm going to chance leaving most stuff in the closet and just spray the entirety of the perimeter of the closet doorway and same goes for bathroom and kitchen. Of course I will try and do what I can beyond that as well. Wear n95.

-reassemble bedframe and place bug interceptors on all bedframe posts and spray them with crossfire too for good measure.

-leave for 4 hours and continue laundry. Go on a walk. Eat Applebee's since it's right around the corner. Get a coffee. 

-bring laundered sheets and clothes in and release cat. Sorry again yo.

-reassemble my mattress and life. Encase mattress for good measure.

-spray vehicle floors and cracks and crevices with crossfire and leave overnight.

-have some beer because I probably went overboard but we can't help it.

-spray again in 3 weeks with a second bottle

-if we still get bit I guess I'll get an exterminator to inspect at that point.

1g6qbxj,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1g6qbxj/i_was_the_one_watching/,I Was The One Watching,"I had always been afraid of being alone. I hated the dark. I hated the little noises and creeks that the house would make when I was little. Nobody thought I would ever move out and be on my own, and truthfully, I started to feel that way too. Until I found my small, cluttered apartment on the outskirts of town. The neighbors were scarce and quiet, but I didn’t mind because it was in the good part of town. The apartment itself was, like I said, small. Barely big enough to fit one person inside the kitchen, and the bedroom was the size of a walk-in closet, but I didn’t care because it was mine and the rent was cheap. I worked as a secretary for an accounting firm, which doesn’t pay too well, but the people there are kind and I’ve made friends with many of them. So, countless, mindless days I would spend filled with work, running errands, and occasionally meeting my friends for drinks. It was boring, and it was simple, and I loved it. Until I couldn’t anymore. 

It was four months ago to the day. I was returning from the grocery store when I first felt it: that tingling, prickling sensation, like eyes boring into the back of my skull. I stopped mid-stride, glancing around the dimly lit street. It was empty, aside from a stray cat darting into the shadows. I shook it off, attributing it to fatigue and the coming darkness. Despite pulling myself together and moving on my own, I was still a good bit afraid when the  night came. There were way too many possibilities, and not enough of me to fight them off. The store wasn’t too far from my apartment though, so I quickened my pace and when I got home, the weird sensation had faded from my mind. 

But, over the next few days, the feeling grew. Subtle things began to shift. I would leave my keys on the kitchen counter, where I religiously left them in plain sight because I was prone to losing things, only to wake up the next morning and find them on the coffee table or stuck in the couch. My mail was shuffled and some of it was opened, as though someone had rifled through it. I brushed it off and attributed it to my forgetfulness, but in the back of my mind I knew it wasn’t me. At night, I heard faint creaks—footsteps—coming from the hallway. Each time I would check, the apartment was as still as ever. I began sleeping with a nightlight, and I definitely felt silly doing so, but it gave me some peace. I decided it was just the natural sounds of the apartment settling, but I lived on the bottom floor and, up until this point, my apartment didn’t creak and no one lived above me. 

One night, I caught a glimpse of something—or someone. I had gotten home later than usual, probably around 1 a.m. I fumbled for my keys at the door, and I just so happened to glance across the street and saw a figure. Just standing there. Unmoving, watching. I froze in place for a minute and just stared back at the person. I snapped out of it and I turned the key, hurried inside, and slammed the door. By the time I had the courage to peek out the window, the figure was gone. I was officially scared. I stood there at the window for a while, and after not seeing anything or anyone strange, I retired to my room. Maybe it was just my mind playing tricks. Stress from work, too little sleep. But something had changed, a creeping presence had wormed its way into my thoughts. No matter where I went, I couldn’t shake the sense that someone—or something—was always near.

Paranoia gripped me like a vise. The feeling of being watched intensified until it was suffocating. The few neighbors I had now felt like enemies. I didn’t know how they were getting in, or who was following me. I was scared to stay put, and too scared to leave. My once comfortable apartment now felt like a prison, each shadow harboring something unseen.

One morning, after waking from a fitful sleep, I took my usual morning shower. I was washing the conditioner from my hair when I heard what sounded like the quiet resistance of fingers on damp glass. I froze in fear once again, my mind racing. My bathroom door creaks loudly from the rusty hinges and I knew for certain no body had opened it. I was the only one with the key to my apartment and I always double checked my locks. I stayed stuck in the shower until the water turned cold, body paralyzed, the whole time listening intently for any sound of another presence in there with me. I couldn’t see anyone through the shower curtain when I finally found the courage to open my eyes. I slowly turned off the water and reached out carefully to grab my towel. When I stepped out of the shower, I found a message scrawled on the bathroom mirror, written in the condensation from the shower: ""Just let me in."" I stared at it, pulse roaring in my ears. Sobs racked my body as I realized that I wasn’t crazy and someone had been here. The words were faint, almost ethereal. I turned to the door, and it was locked, just as it had been when I entered. 

I called the police, but their investigation turned up nothing. No signs of forced entry, no evidence to suggest anyone had been inside. I shoved my phone in his face, forcing him to look at the picture I snapped of the mirror again. The officer looked at me with that practiced, half-pitying expression I would come to despise. He didn’t believe me. Nobody would. None of the locks were broken, no windows smashed or opened. No fingerprints. Just the picture I had taken. Did he think I was making this up? 

My days became a blur of anxious rituals—triple-checking the locks and windows, drawing the curtains, and listening to every creak of the building. Every sound sent me to the verge of tears. At night, the nightmares started. They were vivid, terrible dreams of being hunted by a faceless figure, always just out of reach. I would wake drenched in sweat, my heart racing.

My phone began to vibrate at odd hours—unknown numbers, never any sound on the other end. But the worst part was the photos. It started with one, a picture of me walking down the street, taken from a distance. Then another, of me at the grocery store, and a third of me sitting on the couch in my apartment, alone. The last picture was taken from my kitchen. I hadn’t seen anyone. I hadn’t heard anyone. I once again went to the police. I showed him the pictures I received and he collected my phone as evidence. Once again, it turned up nothing. The sender couldn’t be traced. 

My mind frayed. It was like this person was getting inside my head, twisting my thoughts, making me doubt everything and everyone. I tried to talk to my friends about it, but they either laughed it off or grew distant, uncomfortable with my growing paranoia. What’s wrong with them? Why is everyone so casual about all of this? Do they think this is a game?? I became suspicious of my friends, and the ones who did try and reach me, I didn’t give them the opportunity to do so. My sleep became shallow and broken, the hours blending together as fear gnawed at my sanity.

The presence grew more brazen. I started finding my windows unlocked, though I never touched them. One night, I woke to a cold breeze drifting in through the bedroom window, curtains flapping. I know I’d had it closed and locked before I went to bed. Heart hammering, I bolted upright, scanning the room for any sign of an intruder. There was none. Yet I knew something had been there. The air felt charged, thick with an unseen weight, pressing down on me. I was slowly going insane. The nightmares worsened. No longer confined to sleep, they began to seep into my waking hours. The world around me felt distorted, stretched. Every shadow seemed to move, every flicker of light a threat. I saw the figure in my peripheral vision—just standing there, watching—but when I turned, it would vanish.

And then the whispering started. At first, just faint mutterings at the edge of my consciousness, barely audible, like a faint wind. But, the voice grew clearer. ""I see you. I’m close. So close. Just let me in."" I no longer heard it just on the verge on sleep, I heard it right over my shoulder as I was watching TV, making coffee, staring out of the window. It wasn’t a voice I recognized—it was something else, something inhuman, cold. I didn’t recognize myself anymore. I barely left my apartment, kept every light on, but it didn’t matter. I couldn’t escape it, couldn’t sleep. My mind was slowly unraveling.

One night, in a desperate attempt to confront the entity, I stayed up, hiding a knife under my pillow. I heard the footsteps again, louder this time. A figure moved in the hallway—I was sure of it I could see the shadowy imprint of feet from underneath the door. I leapt out of bed, knife in hand, but when I swung the door open, there was nothing. No one in the whole apartment. 

Except, when I was getting back into bed, I saw something in the mirror—a reflection, not my own. A dark silhouette, featureless, standing where I should have been, whispering to me all the while. It wasn’t long before I understood the truth. This thing wasn’t just stalking me. It was becoming a part of me. My paranoia, my fear—it was feeding off me, driving me mad. 

I found myself outside more often now, pacing the streets at night, lurking in the shadows like the figure had once done to me. I could feel its influence inside my head, whispering to me, guiding my actions. The whispering wasn’t something to be afraid of. It was comforting. It would keep me safe. I didn’t feel watched anymore—I felt compelled. Compelled to follow others. Compelled to stand, unmoving, outside the windows of strangers, watching, waiting. I felt their fear, their confusion, and it brought me a strange sense of calm, of power. This thing had become a part of me, and in doing so, had made me into something else.

One evening, I saw a woman walking alone, much like I had done all those months ago. Without thinking, I followed her, staying just far enough behind to remain unseen. The woman glanced over her shoulder, her steps quickening, panic clear in her body language.

I smiled.

I couldn’t remember when it had all begun. Was the figure in the shadows, or had it always been lurking in my mind, waiting for the right moment? As I stood there, watching the woman disappear into her apartment, I understood: it whispered to me, first, in my sleeping, and then in my waking. Biding it’s time, waiting for me to let it in, waiting so patiently to turn me into the very thing I had feared.

Now, I was the one watching.",2,1729279190.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False

To get proper ratios for milk based drinks I think cup choice would(will?) make a big difference.  Instead of making an iced latte in a mason jar and having WAY too much milk, or having the drink filled to a fairly low point to get a nice ratio - I'd rather have a smaller sized cup.

So, what are your favorite cups/glassware and what drinks do you typically make? 


Here are some I have been considering: 

I mostly make lattes (iced/non) but would want a glass or two for cortados or something similar I suppose as well.

I know the first few shifts will present a lot of “learning opportunities,” but I’m hoping to be as prepared as possible!

The prep (suprep)was NOTHING like people say it is. Sure it was like Niagara falls being funneled through a coffee straw, but thats all it was. It wasn't constant either. You arent ""Trapped"" but stay close.
The second dose however I decided to chug and spent 3 hours throwing up but thats my fault. 

Now comes the really scary part for me, getting put to sleep for the first time.
I was crying uncontrollably because I couldn't take my anxiety medication, but it turns out I had nothing to be afraid of. They literally tell you they're giving you something to calm down, and then you wake up.

Your throat will be sore and your nose will be dry but thats the worst of it. Recovery has been fine, its been 24 hours and it's already better than yesterday. A little soreness and stiffness but its not bad.

Definitely get this done, don't wait on it. Turns out I just have hemorrhoids, ibs, gastritis, and NERD. All treatable things.

The electives we can select contain beauty, gaming, fashion, lifestyle and up until this year, selecting the lifestyle electives meant actual lifestyle brands, so brands that don’t sell clothes or if they do is just partially their business. To give you a known example: Oliver Bonas. They do sell clothes, but also a bunch of other things that fall into the lifestyle category. If this was just about clothes, there’s all the fashion electives that could have been selected instead of the lifestyles.

The lecturer that took over lifestyle electives this year… They are great. Genuinely great at teaching, a wealth of experience, big name in the industry… of fashion. Because of this, what used to be centered around lifestyle brands, now it’s about luxury fashion brands. I understand why. Luxury fashion brand do have a lifestyle component attached to it, but they do… fashion. And I don’t want to do fashion, or I would have selected the fashion electives which my uni offers a plenty.

This week he acted like nothing ever happened last week and we just went about our daily routine – several days of peaceful household. No love bombing or anything that would have made me think he's buttering me up. Just calm and normal 

Situations like this make me wonder if I'm over judging him and maybe he really is just a nice guy trying to do his best but being misunderstood by his cranky and frustrated wife. 

And I have to remind myself over and over I'm frustrated because I keep telling him what I need in the relationship and he keeps ignoring it and yet he does those things for others

And it's those little things he does for others that is the most heartbreaking – because then I can't pretend that he ""isn't wired that way,"" or, ""it's just not in his nature""

For example he used to wear cologne when we go out and now only for work. Even though I've asked him to wear with me too. I personally don't care about cologne, but if you're going to work for work work for your wife too! Especially if she asks 

Or last month I asked him for coffee on the way home from church. I remember it because I made up my mind that day to stop asking him because he always said things like ""we have coffee at home."" But then that Monday morning he decided to make a coffee run for him and his female coworker, texting her to find out what she wanted and paid for it his treat

I keep hoping that this is just a simple case of lack of communication or simple case of two people being overly frustrated for a couple years and we can get back all the previous years if we will ""just"" go to counseling or ""just"" learn how to hear each other or ""just"" XYZ

But then I reread my journal or my Reddit posts and some days I'm reaffirmed – yes! It is absolutely the right decision to make plans to move

On other days I reread my posts/journal and I almost can't believe I've painted such a negative picture of this nice guy who's a great provider 

Anyone else understand what I'm going through?

I was wondering if anyone has bought any of those double coffee machines that do pods and grounds?

I like drip coffee but have been using a French press lately.  My partner likes the K-cups.

Some of the single cup machines are nice and thin which would be great for our apartment. A option for ice coffee would be nice too.

Just wondering if anyone has had one and if they make okay coffee.  Would like to spend less than $100.00 if anyone has any recommendations.

As many of you predicted, my hunt was an epic fail.  Thankfully I didn’t go so far as to put my job or career in jeopardy, but there probably will be consequences.  Here’s how it all went down:

Just after my last update, I texted Alan to meet me at the blackjack tables.  I was hoping that he would join me for a couple of hands before dinner.  I’m a solid player and wanted to show off my skills.  I sat down at an empty table and asked to play 2 hands in order to keep a seat for Alan beside me when he got there.  I knew I was looking hot because there was a noticeable rush of cowboys and golf shirts to my table.  I was still focusing on my “inner Donna” persona when I said, “Hey boys, simmer down, we don’t even know if this dealer is hot or not.”.  The chorus of: “It looks like this table is already hot.”, “You look lucky.”, and “Doesn’t matter, you and I are going to take this casino down.”, was hilarious to me because it’s exactly the response you want but don’t.  I was left disappointed because you really want something different and mysterious.  Like, get me thinking about something other than the obvious.  Seriously guys, do better.

We’d been playing for about 15 minutes when I got the text from Alan.  It said, “Running a bit behind, meet you at the steakhouse at 7:30.”.  Time precision matters for us and work always comes first.  What he’s really saying is that his day isn’t going smooth, but he still needs to meet with me.  I needed to be at the restaurant at 7:25. I arrived at exactly that time and Alan was just walking up when I got there.

I think that every decent Casino resort has a good restaurant.  This one’s a little special for me.  I think our client books our reservations because we definitely get treated like royalty when we’re there.  We have a secluded booth in the back corner that’s private and quiet.  It’s perfect to allow us to have a nice meal while also talking about sensitive client information.  That isn’t what I find so special though.

If you’ve ever been on a corporate retreat or dinner event, you know that there are three classes of attendees when it comes to drink orders.  There’re the people that just want to drink what they like and don’t care about how it will mix with their food.  Then there’s the people that really want to focus on their pallet.  They try to pair their drink choice with their food choice.  Everyone knows the base, red with red food, white with white food, wine choice.  You often get these pretend sommeliers though.  They want to make an impression by sharing their thoughts as well as challenging the suggestions of their servers.  At first, you label them as pretentious to yourself, at least I did.  I now know that this was my own insecurity.  It’s a hobby for them to experience unique tastes on the company’s dime.  It should be applauded not judged. 

It's the 3^(rd) group that I fall into.  I don’t drink, because I can’t, and that sometimes makes me feel like an outcast.  I want to feel what they feel, I’ve often thought about trying to participate, but the fear of falling to floor, twitching like a fish out of water in front of them, wins every time.  There’s always been this feeling of judgement though when I’m at a table of people just wanting to have fun with food and wine.  I’m sure that they think I have some sort of moral or personal barrier that I’m projecting upon them, when the truth is that I just can’t.  I’m not going to presume that this is what an alcoholic that is fighting their urges feels, because I understand that those feelings must be so much more intense, but I can relate.

Last year, on our first dinner here, Alan picked up on my hesitations about drinks.  I was wrapped up in knots about how my choices would be perceived by him when he just said, “They have some pretty awesome mocktails here.”.  I’m sure that I visibly slumped back at that moment.  It was like all of my tension just flew out of my body.  What followed was a fantastic journey of pairing food and drink.  The servers at this restaurant knew their stuff.  It's a Native American resort that has a strong desire to support non-alcoholic choices.  I experienced some of that “food and drink combination tastings experience” and it was fantastic.  Alan fully supported it throughout.  He’s a beer drinker stuck in a wine drinker’s world, that’s how he described it anyways.  He just said that he’s always enjoyed the experience here and we had a fun night talking about flavors and hints of mint or berries with food.

I say all of this because I was excited.  I was looking forward to more experiences while being a little flirty with Superman.  I’d been throwing little Donna’isms at him all day.  Saying things like, “I don’t need a reason to be spectacular” when he praised me, or “I know people better than they know themselves”, when I was able to get to the truth of one of my queries.  It honestly boosted my confidence and made me feel good about myself.

Apparently, it hit a note though.  It actually pisses me off that this became a thing, but I do need to acknowledge that I had a part.  I’d mentioned that I had a division manager make a pass at me but shut him down.  I didn’t give the details though and they clearly mattered. 

He came to the boardroom on time for his meeting.  We’d just introduced ourselves and shook hands when Alan popped his head in to ask a quick question before we started.  I knew the answer off the top, and Alan gave a predictable response of, “Thanks, I figured you’d know.”.  I, being full on confident, said, “I’m Amanda, I know everything.”, while giving a wink to the manager guy.  Alan chuckled and wisped away.  I then went on with my interview.  It got ugly when I was asking him about some expense report discrepancies and he looked at me, all serious, and said, “Why don’t I just book us a hotel room tonight and we’ll make sure it’s coded right tomorrow?”.  Don’t ever say that to an auditor.  He was mocking not only what my job is but also me as a person.

I responded swiftly and with venom when I retorted, “Is that how you spend company money?”.  He knew immediately that he’d walked into a shitstorm.  He stuttered, “No, I just thought we were having some fun here.”.  I replied, “This isn’t a game, here’s what’s going to happen now.  I’m going to send you a listing of every expense report that you’ve submitted over the past year.  I need you to give me a written description of the expense purpose, who you were with, and why it was an appropriate business expense for every line item on every report.”.  I’d pulled up his listing on my computer while I was speaking and said, “It looks like you submit your expenses weekly, and I can see we have about 48 of them here.  I’ve emailed them to you, and I expect your responses by noon tomorrow.  We’ll decide how to proceed from there.  Thank you for your time.”.  I could feel his anger and hesitation as he stood up, I’m pretty sure that I interrupted some stupid comment from him when I said, “Keep your afternoon free tomorrow, I’m sure that there will be follow-up questions.”.  He then slunk out, not noticing my shaking hands.

This started a bitch session throughout department managers about how abrasive and manipulative I am.  It ran up the chain and Alan had spent the past hour or so talking with executives about it.  Dinglenut department manger had complained that I was flirty and blew up a harmless little joke into a witch hunt.  Other managers had circled their wagons with this guy, complaining how “provocative” I’ve been, some had seen me in the casino the previous night dressed in my boots and skirt.  It all was just, well, gross.

Alan stuck to facts with me and heard my side of the issue.  I’d cc’d him my original request and he forwarded it on to upper management, as well as dinglenut, with a simple, straight forward message, “It is our expectation that we receive the requested information by noon tomorrow.  Please reply to all immediately if this is not possible.”.  He told me that this whole thing is ridiculous, but it does happen sometimes when people are challenged by 3^(rd) parties.  He will deal with the supposed joke directly with upper management and that it was clearly unprofessional and warranted investigation not only by us but by the company HR group.

I fell apart and turned into a sobbing mess when he looked into my soul and said, “Now that this junk has been dealt with, WTH is going on with you?”.  I couldn’t hold it in any longer.  I’ve been trying so hard to keep myself together and be the strong person that I know I am.  It just all became too much.  I told him about Ian.  I shared the text with him.  I described my confrontation with him.  I apologized to him about holding it all in and trying to work through my issues alone.  It hurt so much to share my pain and sorrow, but opening up also helped a lot. 

Alan just listened.  He didn’t try to offer excuses or meaning to the situation.  He just listened and asked really thought-out questions that pushed me to reveal more and more of my insecurities about Ian and I’s relationship.  It hurts a bit too much to write about it now, I may do so in the future.

We ended dinner on a high note when we had dessert and a special new mocktail that was supposed to bring us happiness in life (yes there are fun stories behind each drink).  He gave me a big hug and told me to take the day tomorrow.  I was able to convince him that I was okay and needed to get this job done.  I promised to take some time next week to properly deal with my marriage and myself.

So here I am, finishing a morning coffee and getting ready to enter a den of vipers that I’ve riled up.  I have a plan though and I’m pretty sure my grandma controller will help me calm everyone down.  I’ll update from the road tomorrow.  Wish me luck.",9,1729277888.0,stories,5,1.0,False

I met an adult woman, and she saw that I liked her, I invited her for coffee, she turned me down because she has a boyfriend, and from then on, a manipulative mind game started.

Every time she sees me, she greets me politely, with a big smile on her face, her eyes glaze over with happiness when she sees me, then there are days when she is totally cold, she won't even greet me, the woman  literally looks at me and won't greet me, or if she says ""hello"" then it's very cold.

**We all have bad days, but if you look into the eyes of a man who is standing 5 meters away from you and you don't want to say hello, we don't know each other because we have developed an acquaintance relationship,and at the same moment you talk with them to other people normally**

When she returns such a cold look without greeting ""Hi"" I freeze and turn pale, I feel rejected, tricked, manipulative, **and when I don't greet her, then she literally comes up to me and greets me with a smile on her face, why such behavior?**

How can I stop this manipulative mind game from her?

**I noticed that she loves when I give her a lot of attention, then she blooms with happiness and laughs and enjoys it, and when I deny her attention, then she comes to me and then she literally wins me over with her warm smile and I give in first again, and I take over everything, and again nothing.**

**She embarrassed me once in front of many people, and I was embarrassed, after that I ignored her for a couple of days and then she came and wooed me again with her eyes and smile, only to get my attention when I gave in and got over it all.**"" and maybe I shouldn't have, I should have ignored her forever, maybe it would have passed better"" **and then she becomes cold towards me again. Her warm and cold game reactions drive me crazy**. Why is that, how can I defend myself, and I have to see her every day because I'm in such circumstances, I can't avoid it?

my friend    

How much effort is a poem worth?    
Is it a sport worth winning at?    

Do you have nothing to do?    
Maybe it’s time for a poem or two    

The theme is just, let’s say    
a suggestion    
Hope you can make a poem,    
at least one

1g6pm8m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g6pm8m,Newbie in need of advice ,"Okay so here’s the situation I have a coffee table and two end tables that I got off of Facebook marketplace for abt $50. That weren’t in the best shape but I got them all sanded down, wood filled the places that needed it and sanded again. Overall happy with my prep work.

Now here’s the problem part, I used Royal paint from ACE it says it’s acrylic latex, and I’m just wondering if that’s durable for a coffee table and end tables, they are mostly glass with surrounding parts of wood that I painted, so I’m really just looking for advice on whether or not I need to add a varnish or if the paint itself will be enough? If I do need a varnish what is recommended? I’ve looked at all different types enamels, polys, you name it? I’m not looking for a gloss finish and where the paint is at now is pretty nice however I wish the texture was a bit smoother? Overall I’m a first timer that is completely lost, send help!!!

I recently met this girl at a party, and we talked for a bit. Since we study the same major, I see her regularly in the cafeteria, but we're in different semesters and don’t have any lectures together.

Then there’s this girl from my old school. She texted me on Instagram about a month ago, and we’ve been chatting regularly since. Tomorrow, we’re meeting to grab coffee in my hometown, where I traveled for the weekend. I’m not sure how she feels about me, but I get the sense she might be interested. I should mention that I had a crush on her five years ago back in school, but we lost contact after finishing school. Our recent chats give me a pretty good feeling that she’s at least somewhat interested.

I’m a little confused about my feelings at the moment. There was also another girl I liked, but she’s basically in a relationship now, so I don’t see a reason to pursue that further.

1g6pfvb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Indiemakeupandmore/comments/1g6pfvb/sunsphere_scents_some_raves_and_sample_reviews/,Sunsphere Scents - some raves and sample reviews,"Hello! This is my first official review post, even though I have started many others and never finished them :P 

I really enjoy this community - even after a recent TAT / communication frustration soured me on Indies for a bit. But I’m really glad I kept checking in with posts here, because otherwise, I wouldn’t have tried *Sunsphere Scents!*

When they posted earlier this month that they were going to be donating some proceeds to Helene relief funds, I decided that it was a good time to make an Indie exception again and give this new-to-me shop a try. 

I do think it’s important to highlight really positive indie house experiences, so allow me to gush a little bit. I ordered a full size of House Mountain (which was where the donations to Helene relief were coming from), and 5 samples + 1 free sample. 

Here’s the quick and dirty glowing review of the house first, then by scent. 

## Sunsphere Scents - General 10/10

* Incredibly fast TAT. I was shocked to see how quickly it arrived - just about a week I think. I’d have to check dates but I think it was under a week. From Tennessee to WA State. Amazing. 
* Charming and efficient packaging. Everything arrived in perfect condition, with the samples gathered in a sweet little golden pouch. Nothing leaked. Some of the sprayers take a little coaxing, but that’s no big deal. 
* Generous amount in the samples bottles!
* Super sweet little handwritten addition to their card insert. 

And now, for a few fragrance reviews! Adding in my husband’s and my dog’s reactions as well, just to help you triangulate. I saw someone here add in husband thoughts at some point and it stuck with me so, hopefully it helps lol. 

And for other taste-based context, my favorite indie house is Olympic Orchids, and I am a huge simp for nasty photorealistic purple and red/orange flowers and powdery accords. 

### House Mountain - 8/10

This was my first real full-size blind buy, actually! I was a little hesitant to grab a full size, but since it was reasonably priced and proceeds went to relief, I thought worst-case-scenario, I have a gift to give a friend. But lo and behold - I LOVED this one. It’s a very bright citrusy scent on my skin. 

Husband report: “Did you run the laundry? What is that smell?” 

Dog report: Lingered for a moment, grimaced. But he licks his butt. So. 

### 1928 - 7/10

Coffee. Immediate hits of coffee. I have NO idea why, since it’s not listed in any notes lol. I really enjoyed this one fresh out the bottle. The juniper / gin does feel subtle to me, but it might just be the way this one reacts with my skin. A few hours later, the vanilla becomes the star, which kicks it JUUUUUST over into no-go territory for me. But it’s a complex fragrance with a lot of layers, so if you like the sounds of the notes, there’s a good chance you’ll dig this one. 

Husband report: “Ooo it smells like a fancy bar.” 

Dog report. Lingered for a moment, grimaced. This dog sucks at perfume.

### Candoro Marble - 9/10

Now this is what I’m talking about! The notes on this read sandalwood, rose, and aged peppermint. I’mma be honest as the basic, olfactory idiot that I am - I only get rose. Rose rose rose. But a sophisticated rose! I think its complexity comes from the peppermint angle, whether or not I can register it or not. I can’t find the sandalwood at all. But again - idiot here. Unless this unfolds into a grotesquerie after 5 hours, I’ll be full-sizing this one soon. 

Husband report: “That’s nice.” 

Dog report: Lingered, grimaced. I don’t know why I bother with this dog. His look of disgust humiliates me. 

### Red Daisy - 8/10

Love. I’m not actually sure I can identify anything in this one. Maybe I have COVID? But no, I can smell the overall effect and I love it. I think it’s the stale beer note that I have gotten attached to because I am a filthy lush. Full size incoming.

Husband report: “Hey smell this one” (he tried it first lol) 

Dog report: Lingered, grimaced. I shouldn’t keep so much of my self worth tied up in this dog’s opinion of fragrances. Yet...I will. 

### Sunsphere Sunset - 9/10

Ok ok - how are so many of these so good?? I’m not used to having this many consistent hits across the board from a single house. A chilled sandalwood, a little bit of lavender and coffee, and then a stoic amber heart. I love this. Will be full-sizing this one too. 

Husband report: “Oh damn that’s nice.”

Dog report: Lingered, grimaced, rubbed his face all over the couch. 

### Hodges - 9/10

I left this one for last because I’d forgotten what it was lol. Crazy that the first scent I tried from the set of samples (1928) turned out my only miss in this haul. Hodges is a lovely dark-weather scent and I love the library vibes. And the performance across the board is fantastic. Gah. Adding this house to my top 5. 

Husband report: “Ooo” - what a poet. 

Dog report: Fuck this dog. I give up.

Problem is, she has a boyfriend of a couple years, has a kid of her own and they own a house together, and she lives quite some distance from me.

Couple weeks ago, i was working at her office and she asked me to walk with her while she got coffee, and there she wanted to talk about whats going on between us, so i told her it was more than friendship for me, and she said the same but her situation made it impossible.

So i expected her to take more distance, but that didnt happen, we talked more, saw eachother more, and so my head started spinning because i was becoming head over heels for her. Until after one time of us calling, she started showing signs of pulling back so it got me thinking as well that maybe this is going the wrong way.

Today she was at our office and we met after work to talk, because i wanted clarity knowing it would probably lead to me having to get over her. During the talk she said ""maybe if the situation was different and i was a couple years younger, it couldve worked"" which almost makes me feel worse, because i almost have exclusively bad experiences dating, from people playing with my feelings, to being no more than a rebound while always being told ""i was so good to them"" and now the one time it feels like its mutual, it is the situation screwing me over. So we hugged really closely for a while after talking some more, and will probably try to go our own ways while still being friendly.

So now i gotta start the process of getting over her while still working together and hopefully getting back to dating other (probably bad) experiences. Idk if this is the type of stuff that needs to be here, but this talk happened 20 minutes ago and i just wanna talk into the void for a sec.",1,1729276880.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

And basically I gathered the courage at work to ask him out. I sent him a teams message to meet me near the lunch tables. 

I really fancied him, he looks like Christian grey from fifty shades of grey, basically my teenage celeb crush. 

Anyways I am also beautiful so not saying I’m out of his league. But we both are constantly looking at eachother, that’s how it started. Actually when I first seen him I could not unsee him. lol 

He’s super great in my head right now. Even though nothings happened. All I know is his name and the department he works in. 

Anyway, long story short. We met near the lunch tables. I was so nervous. He came in so strong and formal saying “how can I help” I felt shit I hope he’s not a senior…. Anyways he made me so nervous I was trying to utter the words, I go “I was wondering if you want to meet up after work to get coffe or drinks” he looked at me like 😳🤔 I stoped talking he was like nodding like he didn’t get what I just said  I smiled and said “I’m asking you out”…. 

He smiled and then goes “I’m thrilled but I’m seeing someone else”….. at that point it was AWKS! I was like oh okay no worries, we then had to do a walk back to our seats on the office floor, which bare in mind is close proximity as we work in the same department, just diff teams. 

Anyways while walking back he goes “that was very courageous of you, very brave of you” I had to laugh it off, I was like “I was so nervous, but I thought I had to do it, it’s rejection therapy” he just looked at my hands when I was showing him how nervous I was…. Anyways I legged it out of there that time. As in left quickly (I was in the lift and could see him where he sits, when he finished he looked up towards where I sit, to see if I am still there I seen him do that lol) 


Anyways, we both look at eachother. Stare, check eachother out, every day at work when he’s not wfh. I go into work looking hot asf… I know he has strong attraction towards me. I really fancy him. 

But like why does he not try to avoid me? He walks past me, he can walk the other way if he was not interested. He starts to whistle as he walks past me. He looks at my screen, when I’m sat listening to my music or at me, when I look at him he looks away. 

Last week he tried to talk to me, we was in the kitchen area together. He tried to make convo, but this other collegue who knows him a little started to talk about marathons… we was stood next to eachother me and him in eachothers personal space. It felt comforting while I was filling my hot water bottle and he stood next to me, close to me. He could have move the other side…. Anyways all I got to say was how cold I was, when he asked me if I was cold. Idk 

Does he like me? I’m just so fustrated why he doesn’t talk to me more or like do something. It’s killing me…. Not really, but it’s just awful lingering. Why do men not act on their feelings? I really like him he knows it. 

Today I messaged him, to ask to use the coffee cabinet for his team. He goes use my coffee, directed me to which one his was. He replied, all that. I was so nervous to teams him again. Then he came in after, and I went to go use his coffee. And he smiled at me, I smiled back it was the awkward smile at me. But he was smiling a few secs before smiling at me, as if he was smiling with his own internal dialogue and then looked at me to smile at me…. Idk I’m loosing my mind. Why can’t he ask me out?! Fgs. Also I don’t think he is seeing anyone else. If he was he would be loyal and avoid me. Like blank me completely, to not get my hopes up. It’s like this little work secret between me and him, we stare at eachother, or I know I am. Maybe abit to intensely but he’s hot I can’t help it. He knows when I’m checking him out. 

There is this intense like energy with me and him, like I literally get so flustered thinking about him. I feel we have chemistry and sexual attraction. 

But the thing is. I’m asian Muslim and wear hijab, abit like how nuns do, but I’m trendy with fashion, wear like figure hugging stuff. I’m not severely practicing but I believe in oneness of god. And he, is I believe Christian, white . If I was dating him I’d defo be around him in private with my hair down. But like I wish he could see me with my hair out because if I’m 8 with hijab, I’m a bluddy 10+ with my hair down. 

Anyways any kind words would help. Please don’t send anything rude or negative back. 
Anyways what do you guys think? Does he like me? Or am I reading this wrong? This is so frustrating 😩",1,1729276555.0,Crushes,0,1.0,False

Drinking coffee helps but it's just a bandaid.

I don't even know what's causing it.  My current theory is that holding onto anger towards my dad is ""weighing"" me down, but I haven't resolved that yet. 

What else could be causing this?  And how do I improve it?

TW: abuse, rape, eating disorders

I’m frustrated. It’s like no therapist can treat me, no medicine can fix me. I don’t have the courage to die but it feels like it’s the only thing that can be done about me.

Classic backstory with abusive alcoholic druggies dad followed by parents divorce. I was taken by child protective services when I was 11 under false accusations of Munchausens by proxy (think: Gypsy Rose Blanchard situation). I am autistic but was misdiagnosed in childhood as anxiety and PTSD. I am chronically sick. I have had many genetic deformities that went unknown up until adulthood, which ultimately led to ????? Diagnosis, and they thought I was being poisoned. 

In foster care, I was sexually assaulted and nearly nearly raped. I was also mentally and verbally abused by my foster parents, who were specially trained for kids with special needs. They repeatedly told me that I was being poisoned, that no one loved me except for them, all my friends were only kind to me to rape me, all terrible things, etc. they told me I was faking not being able to see, faking my bladder infections, faking my period cramps being so bad to puking, etc. all my conditions and issues were faked. I told them I wanted to be assessed for autism at 13, and they said I was too smart to be autistic, only to take me to be assessed for personality disorders when I was 14. I was laughed and ridiculed when I came out as asexual, biromantic, and nonbinary at 13 as well. 

I got re-united with my family at 17 at the cost of the state-mandated funding. Basically, normally foster kids get money once they age out, but I lost eligibility for that. My mom kicked me out for dating a Muslim guy, as well as finding out me being LGBT. She claims that wasn’t it, but, I was always a good kid. I did my homework, straight A’s, never snuck out. I preferred to sit in my room and play Stardew or Pokémon. I didn’t drink or do drugs or anything. So, I got kicked out the moment I finished college.

So, I was on my on the moment I was 19. With no funding that I would’ve gotten if I had stayed in care a year longer. At 20, I found out about my genetic deformity, and realized this whole time I’ve actually been very disabled and blind. I had to quit my job in my profession I went to school for because I couldn’t do it due to chronic pain and not being able to see things I should.  I went back to college on savings. Unfortunately, the funding was recalibrated mid-college and I stopped receiving funding, and I ran out of savings, leaving me homeless.

I went back to mom and she let me back in while I’m in college for CompSci, and I’m acing it. All A’s, while working three days a week. I’ve been begging her for months to let me stay past graduation so I can build a savings or go to university, but she hasn’t “decided”.

Last week was thanksgiving for me. I went with my mom and brother to my grandpa’s in my birth town. There, my mom started fat-shaming me. I am 5’4 and 150lbs. A little chubby. However, I am recovering from an eating disorder and generally have a bigger build. I was 120 lbs in grade 6, I was 130lbs in Grade 8. In grade 10, I was 90lbs. Only eating a banana and cup of coffee a day. I’ve tried really hard to recover and eat food focused on health rather than calories or sugars. I was 130-140 until I started dating my now-boyfriend, in which I spiked to 150 in happy healthy relationship weight. My mom knows my struggles with food, and I have told her to stop hundreds of times, but she kept bringing it up. Then, my grandpa started trying to force me to get on the scale in front of him, saying I look fatter than I’m claiming to me. It was really, really terrible. It’s brought me back to a really bad low. I yelled at them to shut up and never bring it up again, and ignored them for the rest of the visit. Now that I’m home, I’ve been demanding to my mom to give me an apology. She refused. She said she deserves an apology for how I spoke. I told her flat-out that what happened was mentally and verbally abusive and unacceptable, and then she said she won’t let me go to university or stay past my graduation.  Not that I could’ve went to university anyways, I missed the deadlines to apply since she hasn’t given me an answer up until this point on if I could or not. Reddit SUCKS on my phone and won’t let me edit, but I forgot to mention earlier, I pay $500 a month in rent. That’s fucking atrocious for a full time college student who’s your own child and disabled.  But, my point is I’m not even freeloading.  

I’m just miserable. My mom sucks and her only pleasure is to tear me down and make me miserable. I’ve worked really hard to build a relationship with my grandpa only for him to be happy he’s offended a snowflake liberal. I’m broke and will never have enough money to live comfortably. I’m tired. I’m sick. I’m always in pain. I need therapy and I can’t get it because the wait list is years long. I have no money to go private. I’ve always been a good kid who never got into trouble, yet I’m treated equalivent to that of a problem unemployed druggie child who dropped out of high school. 

I just can’t figure out why I’ve been treated this way. If I had a kid, I wouldn’t charge them rent in school. I’d want them to work and save up for a house because it’s fucking impossible otherwise in this economy. Yet, I’m being charged market value and kicked out, and being threatened with things that I didn’t even have. 

I really didn’t want to go no contact with my family, but I’m tired of being treated so poorly. All I wanted was an apology for them bullying me over my weight when they knew I had an eating disorder. 

And with all of this, being disabled, being full time in college, having no real family (brother is the MPV here), being constantly on the verge of homelessness, it’s just. What’s the point of living? I can’t see. My body hurts all the time. It’ll never get better. There’s nothing that can make it better. The only thing that can help is if I magically win the lottery, so I can buy my own house and so that I never have to worry about being homeless again.  But that’s never going to happen. 

I wish they could just put me to sleep like with anesthesia and just “misdose” while I’m out. ",3,1729276444.0,offmychest,7,0.67,False

Punchcard Perks Story.,"Alright, let me tell you about the moment I realized my loyalty punch card wasn’t just a piece of cardboard. So, I’ve been going to this coffee shop for months, always getting my iced Spanish cinnamon latte, and I started collecting punches on their loyalty card – 10 drinks, and the next one’s free. Simple enough, right?

Fast forward a couple of weeks, I’m on my 10th punch, and I know the next visit is going to be my freebie. But here’s where it gets exciting.. It’s been a long day, and all I can think about is that sweet, sweet free latte waiting for me. So, I pull up to the shop… only to see they’ve closed early for the day. Bummer, right? I’m sitting there in my car, when one of the baristas spots me from inside. She gives me a wave, then walks up to my car and says, “Hey, don’t worry about it – we’ll open up for you!”

Wait, what?! I was that close to driving off, but they saw me and decided to open the shop just so I could get my free drink. I went in.. and walked out with my free iced Spanish cinnamon latte, feeling like royalty.

Honestly, it wasn’t even about the free drink at that point. It was that moment when I realized being a regular meant more to them than just business. That’s the kind of loyalty that keeps you coming back – when a place feels like it’s got you, even when they’re technically closed.

There’s something about a shop going that extra mile that just sticks with you. Has anyone else had a place treat them like that? I’d love to hear how your favorite spots have made you feel like more than just a customer.",1,1729276324.0,PerksCrew,0,1.0,False

My [patreon ](https://www.patreon.com/c/astargazer)is also a thing that you can support if you want to.  Or not.

I'm going to try to post once a week,  Maybe more.  We'll see, no firm promises.

2.10.

Diego watched as the shuttle sped over the dark terrain beneath them. After boarding Renosa’s ship, Eolai had undergone another medical examination in which it was determined that the level 2 medical facility on planet Totola would be sufficient to replace his lost arm and to reprogram the nanites in his body which were currently disabled or only partially functional. They had made for Yonohoan space with all haste, leaving behind several Topokans to reclaim and repair Eolai’s flagship.

“You hanging in there, Eolai?” Diego asked his brother-by-choice.

“I am feeling no pain,” Eolai said. “However, I should not be allowed to make any significant life decisions in the next few hours beyond those required to return me to health. The medicine that Renosa is insisting I take is very effective, but it also clouds my judgment and impairs my mind.”

“You got the good stuff, huh?” Diego mused. He sighed. “Everything has gone to shit.”

“All is not lost,” Eolai countered. “While it is true that the situation is complex and dire, the truth is that this galaxy is one of the better options for a young version of Father to go rogue. There are very few non-human societies for him to target for infiltration and destruction, if he believes that is his mission.”

“Thank god for small miracles,” Diego said.

They passed across the dark continent and came to the medical facility just as dawn was hitting the horizon. The shuttle’s reactionless engines whined slightly as they decelerated the craft from hypersonic speeds to a hover just above a helipad before setting down.

Inside the craft, Diego felt not a sliver of inertia.

They disembarked, and Diego was slightly surprised to find eight Yonohoans waiting for them. He could tell through subtle hints that he had picked up over the last few weeks that these were not holograms; the people were physically present. It was the largest group of Yonohoans that Diego had ever met, and they were here to take care of Eolai’s injuries.

Eolai was practically forced onto a hovering gurney and sedated. Diego made to follow, but one of the Yonohoans stopped him.

“It is only his meat that is wounded,” Trenola said dismissively. “The medical team is more than capable of seeing to his recovery, and they will be busy with correcting the damage done to his body for several hours. In the mean time, I am Trenola. I am a doctor by the standards of your world, and I have been heavily involved in the care of your crewmate, Sarah. I require your assistance in lancing one of the wounds to her soul so that she may begin to heal properly.”

Diego watched as the unconscious Eolai was taken away, into the Yonohoan’s version of emergency surgery. He frowned, but turned to Trenola and gave her his full attention.

“I understand. I’ve been refraining from contacting Sarah or sending her messages due to the advice of Doctor Liu Wei. You believe that it is time to change that?” he asked.

“I believe it is the time for several difficult conversations,” Trenola said. “But they should not begin out here. Come to a sitting room and I shall make you comfortable, and then we will discuss matters of healing.”

Diego followed Trenola into the hospital, noting some of the differences from the ones he had visited on Earth in the past. There were fewer corners and sharp edges; hallways twisted and curved in natural feeling patterns rather than going straight. The rooms had a gentle curving edge to them rather than the straight lines of Earthling construction.

And, of course, there were the floating lights to consider. Rather than florescent lights built into the ceiling, a series of floating orbs lit up as Diego and Trenola made their way past. They gave off a soft warm light, feeling natural and refreshing to Diego. Like light from the sun, rather than the sterile feeling of a light bulb.

The colors were full of earthy tones, with blues and reds mixed in. Here and there were drawings upon the wall that looked like finger paints. Trenola noticed his eyes lingering on them and nodded.

“Many of our patients who remain with us have childlike impulses, including the impulse to leave a mark behind them. If it does not impair the functioning of the facility, efforts are made to preserve these marks. The mural that you are looking at right now has been contributed to by thirty-eight individuals in the past,” she explained.

“So you let your patients draw on the wall. That’s cool,” he commented.

The pair entered a room where several seats and an oblong table awaited them. Trenola encouraged him to make himself comfortable, retrieving a pair of mugs from the kitchen area and filling them with a familiar smelling beverage.

“You like coffee?” he inquired.

“No, but I am told that you do,” Trenola explained. “It is polite to share a cuppa with someone when you have a serious discussion, is it not? Or am I making assumptions about your culture that are not accurate.”

“Sharing a cup of coffee with someone is a polite way of socializing in this circumstance,” Diego agreed. “But if you don’t like it then I wouldn’t insist that you drink the same beverage as me. You can have whatever you want instead.”

“I shall have coffee,” Trenola said simply. “However, I have loaded mine up with a significant amount of sucrose.”

“You like yours sweet, huh? I’ll take mine black, no sugar,” Diego said.

When the coffee cups were distributed, Diego took a sip and made a face. It was terrible. It was based on the instant coffee that they had aboard the *Seeker*, rather than a properly brewed version of the drink.

But it was coffee, and it was strong, and it touched something in Diego’s soul. A little connection to his life back on Earth; breakfast with his mother and abeula perhaps. He sipped his drink and waited for Trenola to begin the conversation.

“Is it permissible to bring Captain Moon and Doctor Liu Wei into this conversation?” Trenola inquired.

“They’re the ones who are helping to make decisions for her, right?” Diego said. “Yeah, that’s probably for the best.”

A moment later, holograms of the two women appeared in the room with Diego and Trenola. Liu looked disheveled from sleep, while Captain Moon appeared to have been caught exercising.

“The opportunity has arisen for Sergeant Cruz to speak with our patient directly. I believe that Sarah is in a difficult place emotionally, but she has reached the point in her treatment where she is stable and comfortable in her environment. I believe that now is the best time to show her the reality of her situation and attempt to bring her out of her delusional state,” Trenola explained. “But I am not an Earthling, so my judgment on how to treat the patient should be questioned by those of her culture. I therefore defer the decision on how to involve Sergeant Cruz in the care of the patient to you, Doctor Wei and Captain Moon.”

“I’m going to start with a sensitive question,” Doctor Wei said. “It is important that you answer honestly, Diego. Have you at any time in the past engaged in sexual activity with the patient?”

Diego blushed, but calmly and firmly denied it.

“Sarah believes otherwise,” Liu informed him. “She believes that you had been sneaking into her room to carry on a romantic and sexual relationship while aboard the *Seeker*. We’ve independently investigated the matter and concluded that there was no evidence, and you have never been accused of any wrongdoing in the matter. Her delusions and apparent hallucinations are a symptom of the progression of her disease and not a reflection on your character, Sergeant.”

“That’s … troubling,” Diego said. He sighed. “If she were well, and we were both back on Earth, I could see myself asking her out for a date and seeing where things went from there. I’ve told her as much in my efforts to reject her with dignity. But that is very, very far from the current situation.”

“What differences do you see? Your perception on the matter is important,” Captain Moon said.

“Well to begin with we were crewmates. There is a strict no fraternization policy aboard the *Seeker* for a number of reasons, not the least of which is the concern of what effect the Tunnel Drive would have on a fetus,” Diego explained. “But it would also have been unprofessional of me and set a poor standard for the rest of the crew. So that’s why when she first approached me I refused to even consider the matter.”

“That is an understandable approach,” Captain Moon agreed. “I would have done the same in your situation, I believe.”

“Right. Well, except that it didn’t end with me explaining that to her,” Diego said. “In fact, it seemed to make things worse. She got the idea that the only thing holding us back from being together was the mission and the policy that we agreed to, and started trying to make me agree to plans once we returned to Earth. I reported the situation but nothing happened.”

“And that was a failure of leadership on the part of me and your superior officers, Diego,” Captain Moon admitted. “For which I humbly apologize.”

“Yeah, I know,” Diego said. “Anyway, I do want Sarah to recover and get better. I’m willing to help in whatever way I can. Except for the obvious. I will not pretend to have feelings for her which I do not have, and I will not engage in a relationship with a patient whose psychiatric condition prevents her from fully understanding or consenting.”

“An understandable and admirable stance,” Liu Wei agreed. She exchanged glances with the other women, then nodded. “I believe that it is time for you to meet with Sarah and pop the soap bubble of the delusions that she has laboring under. This confrontation will cause her pain, but it takes pain to cut away the dead tissue of an infection, and it takes pain to set a bone that has been broken. Until you reject her and make it clear that you will never be together, and that you will never reciprocate her feelings, she will hold out hope to the contrary.”

“You’re asking me to completely devastate her,” Diego said.

“Unfortunately, I believe that is what it will take,” Liu agreed.

Diego sighed. “Okay. I’m not happy about it, but I’ll do it. For Sarah.”

2.11.

Diego spoke with Sarah’s care team for some time before requesting an update on Eolai prior to the confrontation. Diego was informed that the surgery was going well; the nanites in Eolai’s body were taking to the rejuvenation procedure well, allowing them to finally heal some of the less critical wounds that he had suffered in the battle with his father.

The cloning of his replacement arm was also going well, with the procedure expecting to be finished within an hour. After that would be the surgical attachment of the limb, which was relatively routine. The most difficult aspect of the procedure would be growing the nerve connections which would allow Eolai to control the replacement limb; despite Yonohoan medical technology, that would be a slow and painful process.

The sun was up before Diego was finally escorted to a comfortable outdoor waiting area near a stream. Sarah was nearby looking at the water, her toes in the spring, when she noticed him. She exclaimed in joy and ran over to meet him, attempting to embrace him.

He calmly and firmly caught her and kept her from becoming too intimate with him.

“You’re real,” she exclaimed. “I knew you’d come. I was worried that it would just be another hologram, though.”

“Yeah, I’m here,” he agreed. “Sarah, we need to talk.”

She eagerly agreed. She grew less enthused as the talk progressed. When the words “I don’t love you, and I’m sorry but I’m afraid I never will,” were said, she began crying. She held it together long enough for them to go through the differences between her reality and Diego’s.

How he had been impacted by her unwanted romantic and sexual advances. How he had noticed her slipping into her delusions and attempted to get her help. How he saw her as a crewmate and a friend, but nothing more. How her psychiatric condition and fixation on him meant that she could never truly consent to a sexual relationship with him.

She listened through the tears, refusing to allow the emotions welling within her to win and rob her of her dignity.

They did not hug when they parted. They did not even shake hands. Diego reached out for her, but she flinched, and he nodded.

“Be well, Sarah,” He said in parting. “I hope that you recover. I think it’s best if we don’t see too much of each other from now on, but I really hope that you can overcome your current struggles and find happiness.”

In the end, she sat by the little stream, watching the tadpole like fish analogues nibble at her toes, and she wept, watched over by unseen watchers who were ready to intervene should she require it. The tears were tears of healing, the heartbreak she felt was the breaking of a poorly mended bone prior to the bone being reset.

\~\~\~\~\~\~

“So in conclusion, the aliens deny having knowledge about who or what it is that we shot down in Washington State,” Mary reported. “They identify it as a common model of a personal shuttle which a citizen of their society can purchase through the open market. Apparently it’s no more difficult than obtaining a muscle car for them. They insist that their official government had no knowledge or involvement and that there will be no official retribution for shooting whoever it was down. The senatorial aide who returned with Project Seeker specifically said ‘We Yonohoans understand the Earthling concept of ‘fuck around and find out.’ We respect your actions to defend your airspace and would have done the same in your position.’ They do acknowledge that their society isn’t perfectly monolithic, and that organizations outside of their official channels might have had a hand in the incident.

“I have also, as requested, questioned them upon the device that appeared in the Lagrange point several weeks ago. They have confirmed that one of the languages that the jamming device was broadcasting on was High-Yonohoan. They have stated that they do not speak the high-form of the language. Apparently it’s like Latin, they preserve it but do not use it except for official purposes.

“I will now read the translation that they provided. ‘We have fulfilled our side throughout the eons. The Last Son of Eodar has set in motion events which cannot be accurately predicted. Events which may bring about the great darkness, or which may bring light and connection to the universe. The weapon which seeks enemy and finds allies is loose once more in its most unpredictable form. Earth must be preserved at all costs.’ The message then repeats the english message, more or less. They say that there are some nuances to the Yonohoan version of the message which do not translate well.”

She concluded her report, and the men and women of the council exchanged looks. “How go the efforts of reclaiming the wreckage in Washington?” one man asked finally.

“It’s still on fire. We’re lucky that it’s not radioactive, but it’s burning too hot to approach,” came the answer. “The forest fire that was set by the crash is mostly under control, but the vessel itself appears to be self-combusting. No attempts to extinguish it with standard materials have been successful.”

“At least we know that we can defend ourselves against them,” an older general commented. “The fact that it was outclassed by our aircraft once it hit the atmosphere should bring us all some sort of comfort.”

Mary held her tongue. She wasn’t entirely certain what had happened when the spacecraft had engaged in the dogfight, but she had a sense that something wasn’t as it appeared.

“So, either a rogue element of the Yonohoan government is responsible, or it’s one of the many unknown factions of the intergalactic networks that they claim exist,” someone said. “Do we have any idea what their motivation was?”

“Surveillance, I would assume,” another aide said.

Mary shook her head. “If it was simply surveillance, then they would have fled when their stealth craft was detected in the asteroid belt,” she argued. She looked around the table at the old men and women with bars on their shoulders to match or exceed her own. “I think it was an infiltration gone wrong. We couldn’t track them once they went FTL, it was only when they hit the atmosphere that they reappeared on radar. According to the Yonohoans, humanoid is the most common shape and form of aliens in the universe, and if their own appearance is anything to indicate the norm, it would be very easy for one of the other humanoid races to infiltrate our society.”

“If it *was* a black ops mission from the Yonohoans, how do we respond?” one of the younger men questioned. “After all, if they got caught with their hands in the cookie jar, of course they would deny it.”

“First we have to prove it, and we don’t have the evidence to do that,” Mary stated. “At least if we were going to take an official stance on the matter.”

“They are presently the only ones who know where we are,” the speaker pointed out.

“They’re the only ones that we’ve intentionally disclosed our location to,” Mary clarified. “There’s a difference. The unknown military agent who stopped the *Keeper* to question Captain Moon and her staff could have utilized the intelligence that he or she or they acquired from the stop in order to triangulate our position as well.”

“The agent who boarded the Toormonda ship, which I point out again was a gift from the Yonohoans and that the unknown agent possessed override codes for, spoke their language,” the man insisted.

“No, the agent spoke a dead language that the modern language was derived from,” Mary argued. “It would be like a traffic cop pulling you over and speaking middle-english. It makes no sense to anyone.”

The debate shuffled around for a while as various opinions were put forth and either shot down, tabled, or discussed. The simple fact was that nobody knew exactly what had happened, and that was damn troublesome.

“How the hell are we going to secure our world if we can’t even tel where someone is coming into the solar system from?” someone objected.

“The Yonohoans have offered to build us defense stations which they say will help us scan the traffic in and around the local star cluster,” Mary volunteered. “They’re not willing to provide us with ‘advanced’ weaponry yet, but scanner technology is definitely on the table.”

“Which is just great, because I’m certain that there will be no backdoor into these scanner stations which will allow them to keep a thumb on us,” the same man said snidely. “We need to develop our own countermeasures and not rely entirely on the aliens.”

“I agree. The problem is that until we figure out how all of the alien tech works, we have no way of countering it,” Mary pointed out. “My recommendation is that we accept the gifts that the Yonohoans are offering and use them to reverse-engineer the effects and/or find our own countermeasures to them.”

“Our missiles seem to have a proven track record,” the man pointed out. “Two for two by my count.”

The debate continued into the small hours of the morning. Mary sighed. Nobody was trusting the hand that the Yonohoans were extending in friendship, and she couldn’t blame them. The incidents of alien forces invading Sol space may or may not have been factions within their government or non-government agencies, but it wasn’t like the official representation of Earth was above sending in a black-ops team to gather intelligence or complete objectives in their rival and peer nations.

There was no simple solution to the situation. In the end, Mary was assigned to continue negotiations with the Yonohoans aboard the *Seeker* under the presumption of their government’s innocence until such time as evidence was presented to the contrary.

Exhausted, she slept for three hours after the meeting broke up, and then resumed her long-distance calls with Tilandrous and Etalia.

2.12.

Eodar ran.

He kept his suit’s stealth systems engaged, the active camouflage rendering him nearly invisible to the human eye, allowing him to pass through roads and around towns and cities as he made distance from his landing sight.

His suit was low on power, however, and it would lose its stealth capabilities and weapon systems soon.

For some reason, there were wires running everywhere with high levels of electrical current running through them. Eodar questioned their purpose, but they were ultimately useless to him at this stage in his infiltration. His suit didn’t run off of an electrical battery or capacitor, but off of a reserve of strange-matter that provided a reserve of energy of a sort for which there were no english words.

And his reserves were nearly empty. He’d come to consciousness with only forty-percent power. Stealth was an expensive system to run, but not compared to the inertial compensator aerial recovery insertion system. The ICARIS had run him down to nearly fifteen percent. His stealth was running on fumes.

He avoided habitation for now, and made his way into a large forested area. He disengaged his stealth systems when he found a cave with a stream of water nearby. He made a fire, using the traditional Yonohoan methods rather than his suit’s energy systems, and he spent a few moments watching the flames dance.

He thought of home. Of his early childhood, sitting around the fire and listening to his clan members tell the tales of how they thought the world was.

Before the night of the meteors, when the scouts from the stars had come to the People of the Yonohoah.

He remembered that night as well, and he thought of the parallels to his own situation. The scouts in that mission had been ordered to make contact with Eodar’s people, while Eodar’s own mission required stealth, but the purpose was the same.

Evaluate the planet for any evidence of the enemies of mankind. Report the finding to High-Command. Await further instructions.

He removed his helmet and set it nearby. The air on this planet was musty and thick, heavy with moisture. He had grown up in a savanna, with sweet smelling grasses and dry heat. His suit mostly regulated his body temperature just fine. He didn’t need the fire to keep warm; he had built it for other reasons.

He sighed and made a rocktala from a stone. The Rocktala was primitive, barely intelligent enough to understand it’s purpose, but the nanites in his suit quickly transformed the rock into a thinking device and Eodar threw it into the fire so that it could generate the power necessary to fulfill it’s functions.

“I am Eodar of the Yonohoan. Forward Scout Rank 2 of the human liberation forces out of Totola space. I do not know how long ago I was born, I suspect I have been in stasis for some time. But I have lived for twelve years. I am a recent graduate of Scout Training, but I have received orders to infiltrate the planet known as Earth and evaluate it for hidden elements of the enemies of humanity.

“Earth is not entirely undefended, as Totola was when the scouts arrived. They detected me in the asteroid belt and I was forced to sacrifice my transportation vessel in order to arrive on the planet. Hopefully, the officials of this world believe that the pilot of the shuttlecraft died when the self-destruct method was engaged.

“I am currently in a wilderness area. My suit is low on power, and I will be forced to abandon it soon. I will attempt to infiltrate Earthling society by posing as one of their children. It is for this purpose, after all, why scout training typically begins at birth. I was grateful when High-Command recognized the value of the Yonohoan people and included me into their training program despite being eight years old prior to the training, if you disregard the four years that I spent aboard a Toormonda vessel.”

Eodar continued his report for some time, the small and stupid Rocktala recording his image and his words. When he finished, he placed the rocktala in the top of a tree to assist its message in being broadcast and set it to issue his report in six months.

Then he returned to the fire and continued to watch the flames dance until he fell asleep.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

In the morning, he followed the stream from the cave he had slept in for some time. He was uncertain how to make contact with or infiltrate the human society of this world. It would help significantly if he knew who their overlords were, as that would tell him much about the shape of their society. He had been ordered to infiltrate, which hopefully meant that the intelligence of his commanders had determined that he wouldn’t be killed on sight for being an outsider.

Following the stream led to a lake, and at that lake he had his first encounter with the humans of this world. Five children were swimming and splashing in its shallow waters. All boys. He examined them from a distance with his stealth systems engaged, watching them play while they remained unaware of his presence.

Unfortunately, he noticed a problem. Their heads were shaped differently than his. The difference was small and subtle; their foreheads were more prominent and didn’t have the slight slope that was common in his people.

He cursed as he realized that this might out him as an outsider, and he realized he was going to have to make an unfortunate sacrifice to protect his cover.

He returned to the cave for privacy, and he prepared himself. He brought up a holographic depiction of his image and he modified it to match the features of the humans of this world as he had identified the key characteristics while he had been watching the children play. Then he engaged his nanites, causing them to forcibly alter the structure of his skull.

The pain was intense. He screamed into his helmet, which silenced his voice but not his soul. He did not hold back, feeling no shame in the display.

It was agony.

It was necessary for the mission.

He would endure.

Once the pain subsided, he decided that it was time to make contact. And abandon his suit. With a command, he ordered it to self-destruct. The suit dissolved into nanites, which flaked into powder and blew away on the wind.

He walked back to the lake, hoping that the children who were playing in the river would accept them into their number, and that he could learn from them their language and sneak back with them into their society.

When he arrived, the children stopped playing. They turned and talked to each other nervously in their language. Eolai remained silent, a friendly smile on his face.

One of the boys turned and called out to him. Eolai repeated the words of greeting back. The boy said something else, and Eolai repeated the words once more.

The children spoke among themselves once more, and then the youngest one ran into the forest. The boys gave him a pair of pants to put on, and after a few moments an adult emerged. Eolai was unafraid, he had expected adults to be nearby to protect the children, despite having left them alone to play with each other.

The adult spoke with him for some time. Eolai carefully repeated each word as it was said, making it clear that he was trying to be understood.

The man pulled from his pocket a device and spoke into it for some time.

Soon after, another man appeared. Dressed in green, the man had a serious expression on his face as he walked over to Eodar. He spoke for some time, and Eodar continued to repeat the words faithfully.

The man shook his head and sighed.

“Come with me, son. I don’t know who abandoned you out here, but we’ll get you the help you need,” he said.

Eodar repeated the words back, completely unaware of their meaning. He followed the man for some ways until they arrived at a vehicle, and he left with the man.

Hopefully the officials of this world would not associate his appearance with the events that had taken place the day before. Even if they did, however, he would simply escape their custody and use the knowledge that he had gained of their language and culture to establish a new cover.

For now, he was content to surrender themselves for whatever this world’s practice was for finding lost or abandoned children.

2.13.

“The quest for life in space has taken a surprising turn recently when the Earth Space Force and a number of their member organizations released an official statement moments ago. They have confirmed the rumor that the *Seeker of New Discoveries*, the interstellar mapping and exploration vessel which was launched just a little under two years ago, returned ahead of schedule to announce that they had made contact with an alien civilization.

“The organizations confirmed that two delegates from the alien government are aboard the *Seeker* and have been engaged in preliminary negotiations with the governments of Earth. The aliens claim to be friendly and have offered to extend Earth significant aid in the form of advanced technology, medicine, and resources in exchange for nothing more than sharing our culture with them.

“According to the officials, this announcement was made in preparation for the arrival of alien ships in the system. These ships are said to contain a delegation from the aliens, who call themselves the Yonohoans, as well as containing the remaining crew members of the *Seeker* who remained behind.

“More details are expected to arrive in the coming hours, so stay tuned to KXKRN for--”

Olivia Nunes turned the radio off. Aliens, really, she thought to herself, scoffing. While KXKRN was usually reliable, the absurdity of the DJ’s falling for a prank like that made her shake her head with amusement and disbelief. She sighed, turning her attention back to the reports. She picked up the recording device and began her dictation.

“This is the admission notes on patient John Doe #20495. Patient is a twelve year old male found wandering in Echo Valley Park by a group of boy-scouts on a camping trip. According to the scouts the patient was found without clothes, but examinations have found no other signs of abuse. The patient is currently nonverbal, although according to initial reports he initially greeted his rescuers by repeating any word spoken to him. We are uncertain why he stopped doing that, but it proves that he’s capable of talking. We just have no idea what he wants to tell us.

“Patient was taken by park rangers to the emergency room, where he was evaluated. The patient appears to be in perfect health for his age and was compliant with the authorities. We didn’t even find the usual signs of deprivation from being out in the wilderness alone, suggesting that if he was abandoned there, it wasn’t for very long. He was admitted to Shadow Lake Children’s Hospital for evaluation and is currently under observation.

“The child does not appear to understand english, but follows non-verbal instructions and cues quite well. He has shown little interest in participating with the attempts to get him to draw or participate in arts and crafts. He listens to the other children when they speak to him but no longer attempts to respond to them.”

She paused, thinking about her words. “I think he’s watching us watching him. Like he’s trying to figure out what we’re going to do about him. He does not seem frightened or concerned by his situation at all. He enjoys watching television and listening to music and the radio, so we’ve given him a portable radio for his room, which has led to the only behavioral issue that has been reported so far when he refused to allow staff to turn the radio off at bedtime.

“Until we know why he has gone nonverbal or identify his origins I recommend that he remains hospitalized. If he starts communicating, perhaps we can discharge him to a foster home after ensuring that he’s not at risk for elopement. At present his fingerprints do not match any in the database for missing children. We are awaiting DNA results to see if we can find his family.”

She ended her dictation and adjusted her papers, moving on to the next case.

\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

In another hospital, many light years away, Diego sat with his brother-by-oath and helped him with his physical therapy. It seemed strange to be playing patty-cake with a grown man, but it was literally doctor’s orders to perform the exercises involved to help Eolai recover his dexterity. The Yonohoan had been clumsy to start with, but interestingly enough when Diego had included the melody of the children’s rhyme his performance had increased significantly.

They continued for some time before Eolai sighed, leaning back and returning his new-arm to its sling.

“I have failed one of my oaths,” he commented.

“One out of thirty-two thousand isn’t so bad,” Deigo assured him.

“Yes, and the exact circumstances are exonerating as well. I came to the surface of planet Totola not to live but to receive medical care to prolong the duration of my life. As such my other oaths remain intact. But the fact that I wasn’t considering it while I was under sedation shows how significantly my judgment was impaired. And my still be impaired,” Eolai said.

“You had your arm ripped off by a highly trained and dangerous combatant who also fried your body’s nanites,” Diego pointed out. “You can’t let this make you doubt yourself, Eolai. I’m not used to being the confident one in our relationship. I know this situation is difficult, but you don’t have time for self-doubt.”

“You’re right,” Eolai agreed. Then he sighed again. “The question is what to do about this situation. Our obligation to our father exceeds all other oaths, and so we must set out on a quest to find him. The problem is, I have absolutely no idea where he might have gone.”

“I do,” Diego said.

Eolai raised an eyebrow.

“A figure in power armor stopped the *Keeper of Dreams* not long after the attack,” Diego said.

Eolai rose in concern. “Your crew was not harmed, I hope!”

“Nobody was hurt. A figure who was described as being 5’1” in body armor interrogated the crew, forced a download of the experiment’s data, and left. Nobody really knows what the hell to think about it, but according to Gabriel the data could be used to figure out Earth’s location, so Captain Anders decided to return to Earth. The *Keeper* is en route, along with an escort this time.”

“You believe that Eodar is targeting Earth?” Eolai asked.

“I can’t think of any other reason why they would have made a clone of him in this day and age,” Diego said.

“I can. And it would be my fault,” Eolai said, sighing. “I believe that this stems from my decision to name you brother. If Eodar would have killed one of us, then he would have slain his son and faced disgrace in the eyes of many societies. It would have weakened many of the treaties that hold our delicate peace in place.”

“But he didn’t kill you, and he left me alone completely,” Diego said.

“Indeed. You must understand … there is a reason nobody resurrects Eodar beyond respecting his religion. If it was just that, then he might still be called in service to humanity,” Eolai said.

“Okay, I’m listening.”

“Eodar has a tendency to kill the people who do so,” Eolai said. “And possibly do exactly the opposite of what they resurrected him to do. It depends on the exact circumstance, normally he waits to understand what is happening before acting. But when he understands who it was who overrode the lockouts on his imprint, he almost always has them executed, including everyone who was involved in the decision.”

“Do you think that’s why he attacked you?” Diego asked.

“Perhaps,” Eolai said. He scratched his replacement hand nervously. “I do not know, Diego. He is so young this time. The youngest imprint that I know of of my father was taken at age sixteen. I am appalled that there was one even younger. While they were in an untenable situation, I still find the actions of the High-Command during the opening stages of the Liberation War to be appalling with its use of child-soldiers.”

Diego’s throat was dry. “Tell me again how an imprint is taken. It’s not just used on people, right? You can duplicate weapons and other items with the same technology?”

“An imprint is a perfect record of matter on a subatomic level,” Eolai explained. “It can be used to duplicate that item endlessly provided you have the mass and energy to print the imprint. However, it has been illegal to take an imprint of a living human being since the middle stages of the Liberation Wars.”

“Because it kills them,” Diego said.

“In order to create the perfect record that is used to create a perfect copy, the matter is destroyed utterly. The measurements taken during the destruction of the matter are what allows the recording of the imprint,” Eolai said. “It pains me that the original Eodar was murdered by his commanders as a young child.”

“And you didn’t know that there was a version of him that was this young,” Diego said.

“I did not,” Eolai agreed. “I mistook him at first for a regular scout trooper because his armor was more modern than what was available during the time when Eodar was born. When he told me his name, I grew excited because I realized, despite the tragedy, that I might have a relationship once more with my father. Not through recorded messages but through flesh and blood. Our roles might have been reversed, with me the elder guiding him the way that his messages from the past once guided me, but it would have been the bond of family. I should have handled the situation better.”

“Let’s not focus too much on the recriminations, Eolai. Let’s think things through. If an enemy of the Yonohoan resurrected Eodar to use him against your people, then what are the worst case scenarios. Aside from killing one of his sons,” Diego said.

Eolai considered. Then grew more serious. “I believe we should go to Earth now.”

“Why?”

“Because your family may be in danger. And possibly your entire world. If Eodar walks planet Earth, then it becomes a potential target for a preemptive strike by a number of vast powers which your people cannot hope to overcome.”

Diego paled. “That’s not good, is it?”

“The Yonohoans will stand with the people of Earth, Diego. We will defend your world as we would defend Totola. But if the universe finds out that Eodar once more walks a darkworld, they will send fleets from galaxies far and wide to ensure that the war does not restart once more. They would consider the death of your people as a small price to be paid.”",5,1729276247.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

""To enable the filter and coffee machine to communicate, JURA uses modern RFID technology.

If the filter is not changed, the machine activates descaling mode. After a certain amount of use, the user is prompted to descale the machine. This can only be done when the filter is removed, **so there is no more risk of user error resulting from misunderstandings**.""

  
On the other hand the life time of a **filter is limited to 2 months,** but even beyond that the machine doesn't tell me that the filter needs to be changed.

I switched up my diet a bit and I think it changed my cycle. which as a woman really affects my energy. 

but before yesterday/today, I was super consistently energetic. I went from high carb/sugar foods to high protein. and idk it def felt good to do and I will prob sorta continue for a bit. 

but today I needed a break. my period has been weird since I switched my diet, I think it’s just adjusting to the change. but it came last night or perhaps it’s just spotting but there are cramps and I def felt the fatigue/ hormones. it’s just not as heavy as it usually is. 

but usually before my period I eat a lot more and am moody. I didn’t experience much of that till yesterday, and it came with my period instead of before. now I really feel it. fatigued very very fatigued. with cravings. and i’m letting myself indulge today (and kinda last night) and i’ll get back on track after today. bc I believe I work the best when I give myself the time off. 

also the weather finally cooled down here, but I think that makes humans more fatigued. plus this might just be a personal thing but the full moon was last night, i’m always more tired around full moons. plus it was in aries which in my opinion is the most exhausting sign. 

my roommates are less into looking at energy like this, so I feel so lazy compared to them. but also, when I look at all our lives, I prefer my life over theirs. like I really do reach my goals living like this. but I sometimes forget this is what works for me and feel insecure. 

also my medicine isn’t working as well so I might have to up my dose today. just to be functional cuz I feel unwell and my meds not working is just a disaster. it feels good to acknowledge my feelings instead of pushing them away. 

luckily I don’t really “work” until tn 8pm -12am. 

I still wanna get myself together cuz I lowkey could work the next 2 days as well. 

I think i’m also tired cuz I had a busy week before this. coffee with a new friend and then went on this very long adventurous trip for work and I really liked my crew. so I burned out my social battery and my physical battery tbh. cuz I kept up with my workout routine and everything lol. and then immediately after that I had recurrent training which wiped me out for whatever reason, I didn’t sleep the one night more than 2 hours cuz I had to wake up early to study. 

so I think i’m lowkey catching up on energy from that as well. 

I think I will feel better soon since i’m really trying to take it easy now. 

and I will adjust my meds/food/exercise as necessary today to accommodate to my needs. 

another thing now that i’m laying around feeling low energy. i’m kinda sad cuz this guy I was talking to I guess he kinda did ghost me. like he called me and texted me last month saying he loved me (which was kinda crazy too soon) and that he would be going out of the country for a trip.  I didn’t expect him to be gone this long and the whole thing feels suss which makes me sad. cuz seeing him made me so excited and now I feel nothing. 

I just need more zest and excitement in my life. but when I get the zest and excitement then I get burned out. but i’d love some consistent non burn out zest and excitement lol 

well it feels good to have acknowledged my emotions and validated why I am so mf tired, but that it’s all part of my 28 cycle ",1,1729276043.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

My first visit for discomfort was with my ENT end of June, 2 months prior (april) I had a tonsillectomy, I was experiencing a weird sensation on the right side of my neck/throat and I genuinely thought my tonsil on my ride side was scarring bad or growing back. She told my it was called globus potentially from acid reflux(no regurgitation )She recommended I change my diet and see if it helps.


Mind you, I've never dealt with acid reflux my 27 years of living.


I keep going on and about and suddenly I started getting facial cramps/ facial pressure, eye pain, on my right side of my face and it would feel swollen, along with this I'd have a dull feeling in my adomnen but nothing painful. I went to urgent care and they told me I have TMJ. Which is essentially jaw issues from teeth grinding etc. No tests were ran. I visited my dentist because I take anything around my face or head as a serious matter. He told me it could be TMJ but he checked my bite width and it had no change since our previous visit, typically your bite size is smaller. I told them it must be a crazy coincidence that I'm dealing with TMJ and acid reflux? Just my luck.


Awhile goes on and I'm dealing with both off and on, my throat constantly, never seems to go away right side ONLY, facial cramps here & there and weird feeling of pressure in my sternum area.

Along with this I would get ""nerve pain"" all over my body, felt like my body was inflammed and my skin was burning/stinging. SO BAD. Sometimes my hands would tingle, my face right side would tingle, sinus area would feel strange, burning, flaring, throat would feel swollen, feet and legs tingling.
Time passed and I wasn't sure what was going on with the constant burning, I'd wake up and feel like I was in the sun all night though my skin didn't look sunburnt, sometimes had a very light tint of pink to my skin, it felt like it was on fire or super sunburnt.

 All of July I fought this feeling out.

 In August I was getting really sharp pain on my right side below my ribs, it would knock the wind out of me and I was scared because I thought maybe a lung collapsed or something ?? Because I had right side abdominal pain the urgent care I visited did a ultrasound on my gallbladder, my liver and pancreas, The doctor I saw pushed on that area and I told her that's where I was experiencing pain. She told me that no gallstones were found so she's not sure what the pain could be from. She said everything I am explaining is saying it's my gallbladder but I have no gallstones. I left with nothing except feeling crazy. Was told it's probably anxiety.


Most recently I have had bad experience with indigestion and chest burning and pain. It feels like anything I eat or drink is getting stuck in my chest. I have lost some weight because I have reconsider what I chose to eat knowing I'll be in discomfort for the next hours. I visited my doctor and told her everything, she put me on omeprazole for 8 weeks and my first two days I threw up anything I tried to ingest, the thought of food made me sick to my stomach. I went back into urgent care and they tried to put me on protonix and I broke out in a rash by my thighs and on my stomach my first day taking it, so I went back to omeprazole.


At my 5th week, my Symptoms got worse. I went back in and my doctor told me it takes 8 full weeks to not experience symptoms which I think is total BS. She gave me a referral to neurology, prescribed me Gabapentin LMFAO... and told me she wants to test me for H pylori stool test. Another two weeks went on and I feel so weak and fatigue not able to eat anything, pain all the time along with discomfort EVERYDAY. I felt this expending doom take over and I feel like this is fucking up my mental health. I spoke with another doctor of internal medicine and he said I HAVE TO STOP THE OMEPRAZOLE FOR TWO WEEKS THEN DO MY STOOL STAMPLE OR ELSE IT WILL READ NEGATIVE????? My GP never mentioned I stop taking anything, not once? At this point im confused, I'm crying and begging to just be Referred to see a specialist that deals with ""acid reflux"" pleaseee, he said I have to do the stool test first, then take omeprazole for another 6-8 weeks twice a day, THEN They will refer me to a Gastro doctor if I'm not better. This is such bullshit!!!! I'm barely eating and I feel like shit everyday and they expect me to live like this and go to work! I'm livid. I've tried being patient.


Before this I was in an out of the emergency room with extreme shortness of breath, difficulty swallowing, told them about my facial cramping, nerve pain, everything. I was embarrassed but I would go in when I was really scared and sick. I felt as if they viewed me as a freuqent flyer They ran no tests except blood work and told continued to tell my they treat life or death in the ER. They asked if I'm ""overthinking something and if I think I have cancer or if it could be anxiety"". I literally laughed bc of the gaslighting. My blood pressure usually sits at 110/and my er vitals would be 158 which seemed abnormal for me. I would be in a lot of pain or discomfort. 

I ended up getting super sick shortly after and took a visit the hospital. My right side below my ribs hurt, I was in extreme pain, I was having a spasm like sensation which lasted for 8 hours+ and I ate nothing except for coffee and a banana. A very strange symptom I had was when I would apply pressure on my right leg or stand with  all my weight or sit on my right side it felt like oxygen was getting cut off or a nerve was being pinched and I was getting super lightheaded. It also felt like it was hard to breathe, but I swear it felt like a nerve was pinched off or I was lacking oxygen to my head. I finally sat down with the doctor and asked them to run additional testing because I know my body and something is wrong. She took a look at the ultrasounds I got done in August and told me the doctor missed something bc it wasn't mentioned to me that I have Comet-tail artifact associated with adenomyomatosis. She didn't care about my nerve or the lightheadness sensation and blew me off and had me talk to a surgeon, because I didn't have an infection they weren't going to remove it that day. I do have to see a surgeon this up coming week in October. She said she is for certain all of the things I'm experiencing is because of my gallbladder. 
My question is why so suddenly? Why is my gallbladder the last of my big symptoms? What about my throat sensation? Beig lightheaded? My gallbladder pain isn't always happening and I still have other symptoms. I am also confused because I  my report said ""No gallstones visualized. The gallbladder wall appears normal and measures 2.45 mm."" I tried to look into and got no answers. I saw that most of the time it can cause issues when there's thickening of the gallbladder walls but they reported my gallbladder walls are normal. I'm lost and stressed and tired. Mentally, and physically at my limit.


I'm sorry for the long post thank you to anyone who took the time to read it. I am in hopes that someone out there is also dealing with something similar. If anyone has any suggestions or similar stories, please feel free to share them.

I have also had tons of bloodwork done if there's any questions about that, I can share it also.


Symptoms: Chest burning, indegestion sensation of food being stuck in my chest, burping after water or eating, bloated, feeling like I am gassy but can't pass gas, was having diarrhea 2-3 times a day and now constipated, right side spasms, shortness of breath sometimes thought it was an asthma attack, right side of my body doesn't seem to be functioning as well, left side of fine, throat issues right side GLOBUS, difficulty swallowing at times, swelling of the face right side, sinus issues such flaring burning, the feeling of needing to go poop but not being able to, current extreme anxiety, feeling of doom and never ending, fatigue, lightheaded, headaches.
maybe some other symptoms I'm forgetting but just ask!

This is important for me to note as I already feel I work way too hard for way too little way too early in the day, and thus discouraged from sacrificing any more of my free time doing extra ""favors"" or work for my higher-ups. This feeling is mutual between me and the other workers, none of us feel appreciated due to the aforementioned work conditions, but that is beside the point.

My contract says ""work begins at 6.30am"", plain and simple. I interpret this to be the time I clock in and start getting paid. If I clock in any earlier than 6.30 I don't get paid until 6.30, and so it is not ""work"". I clock in at the gates, then go change to my work attire, then walk to a different building on foot. The reason I don't change at home is that we work with corrosive agents, powders, and other substances that don't easily come off, and I feel filthy wearing these clothes anywhere else, especially after a full day of work stinking like hell; I don't want them anywhere near my car seats, my bed, or my dog. We are also not given enough clothes to last us the entire week, which only exacerbates the issue.

Changing takes about 6-7 minutes, walking takes another 2-3 before I get to my workstation. Naturally this means that I don't physically start my job until about 6.40am, which my boss really hates. I am not even allowed to make coffee or speak to my coworkers, I am expected to start working immediately. He says that I am late every single morning, to which I reply saying I come in at the exact time my contract requires. He says that ""work"" begins as soon as I am physically at the station, not when I clock in, to which I say that it begins as soon as I start getting paid, which is no earlier than 6.30am (he expects me to come in early to change). He says in that case I can change at home to save time, to which I reply with the above. He says I am losing him 3 hours of efficiency every month, to which I say that I don't get paid to be there for 3 extra hours. He says that coming in early is a known custom at the workplace, to which I say this custom needs to be outlined in the contract and the worker needs to be compensated accordingly.

This goes back and forth nearly every single day and has started to become draining on my mental well-being. Starting a physically intense day with conflict sucks. The last time this happened he told me I will be summoned to a disciplinary hearing with his boss. Is it really unreasonable for me to consider changing and walking to the building to be part of the job? I worked at two other factories and both had no issue with the worker changing ""on the clock"". Is there anything I can say or do to change their minds? They pay us to have a 13-minute shower at the end of the day, why is taking 8 minutes to get ready at the beginning of one an issue?",31,1729275878.0,antiwork,14,0.95,False

I've gotten diagnosed and treated by multiple doctors. I'm 28 now so this will be a long post.

These things have helped me feel better overall but for “results” of each I will focus on how they helped with PMDD symptoms specifically. 

If you’re reading this and feel inspired, don’t try to implement everything at once. 

If I were 20 and saw all the changes I would need to do, I would be so overwhelmed. 

I just thought my experience could help others the way others on this subreddit have helped me. 

# My symptoms: 

* Very typical PMDD: symptoms only during luteal and get progressively worse until my period starts. 
* Very consistent cycles so I always know a range of 3 days when my period will start. 
* Symptoms start 7ish (rarely 10-14) days before period 
* Bloodwork showed my hormones were normal. 

From most bothersome to least:

* **severe fatigue**
* **depression with mild SI**
* **migraines that leave me bedridden**
* **complete lack of motivation** 
* **painful tension in body - neck/shoulders and lower back**
* **irritability** 
* **intense cravings that lead to binge eating**
* **insomnia 1-2 days before period** 
* **brain fog**
* **constipation**
* **bloating**  
* **occasional allergy/flu symptoms** 

These led to me taking a lot of unpaid sick days and having to drop many classes in university + losing two jobs. 

# What didn’t work for me: 

* Citalopram/Celexa for 9 months

Made me just feel zoned out all the time. Helped against negative feeling/thoughts but nothing for fatigue and lack of motivation.

* Birth control pills (yaz and slynd) 

Yaz (drospirenone+ethinyl estradiol): seemed to work for a few months then didn’t. I also hated the side effects (uncomfortable vaginal dryness mostly)

Slynd (drospirenone): tried for 2 weeks but noticed I was slipping into a bad depression and had to stop. 

* cutting out caffeine

I don’t drink coffee daily, only crave it during luteal. I didn’t notice any improvement when I tried going without for a few months. 

* L-Theanine - didn't notice any difference

# What worked: 

* **psychotherapy** 
* **getting rest**
* **exercise**
* **high protein diet** 
* **treating my ADHD**
* **supplements: magnesium and iron**

I'll go into each of these in more detail.

# Psychotherapy: 

When I was 24, I finally found a therapist who was compatible with my needs (took 3 incompatible therapists to find her) and did almost 2 years of therapy. I had mental issues outside of PMDD, and I'd say this resolved most of them. Apart from luteal, I don’t get depressed anymore and it never gets as bad as it used to

**RESULTS:**

* stopped spiralling into depression that continued after luteal
* much better mood
* learned to notice signs of migraine coming to prevent them

**Note about therapy because I notice a lot of you here seem to have similar issues as me:** 

I was one of those “self aware” patients who knew what the problem was but not how to fix it. So she focused on teaching me self compassion + how to notice feelings and feel them without intellectualizing them. This led to respecting feelings and setting boundaries accordingly. I was raised to be “rational” and analyze my emotions. Turns out this numbed me and didn’t even notice my own anger (except during luteal of course). 

**How to find a therapist:**

Unfortunately, it comes down to trial and error. My best therapist was not the most experienced or had some unique specialty. She is just good, probably just naturally skilled. A lot of trained therapists don't know how to deal with ""self-aware"" patients and that's just a lack of skill. It can be expensive to try to find the right therapist but don't stick with one if you don't feel right after 2-3 sessions.

# Rest

This was a big one for me. I kept trying to push through luteal and keep being productive but would crash. 

I learned to take it easy. I’m back in school now and working part time so I try to study more outside of luteal. I still occasionally take days off from work but now I call in earlier rather than waking up the morning, realizing I just can’t and calling in last minute. 

Basically, when I notice that burnout feeling, I give myself smaller doses of rest to recharge rather than pushing until I crash and need 1-2 weeks of rest. I plan around my cycle as well.  
On rest days during luteal, I let go of trying to do work or be productive and just accept ""I'm spending the day in bed"". Then, I can think about whether I want to do anything: inviting a friend over to hang out, do my nails, read a book, get some easy chores done. Or just lay in bed.  

Mostly, it was just about being gentle and forgiving towards myself (shoutout to my therapist) and being ok lying in bed all day sometimes. 

**RESULTS:**

* much better mood 
* no longer deal with post luteal depression and anxiety (the ""OH GOD NOW I HAVE TO CATCH UP! I HATE MYSELF!"" feeling) 
* much less fatigue
* migraines are rare now

# Exercise: 

Finally started 4 months ago and I can say this has had the biggest and fastest impact on my symptoms.

Strength training + walking (cardio in the gym was so boring to me). My goal is mobility and strength.

I can’t say I’m 100% consistent but 3 days a week even if I miss a week every month still has a noticeable effect. 

**RESULTS:**

* much less tension in my body 
* period seems to come earlier when I work out - for me that means less days in luteal yay. If I don’t get any exercise, I find my period can feel “stuck” like days of spotting but still feel like I’m in luteal until it properly starts. 
* much less fatigue 
* more motivation 
* much better mood 

**Note about starting exercise and motivation:** 

I think I wouldn't have been able to start with this even if I knew how much it would help. Treating my mental health issues and ADHD gave me the bit of motivation I needed to start exercising.

So if you can't start exercising now, try other things first.

# High protein diet

I overall eat a lot of protein now but I really focus on this during luteal.

I learned this from just noticing how I felt after meals. Having a big portion of protein in every meal (meat/eggs mostly) + lots of veggies made me feel so much better. Especially makes a huge difference during luteal. 

If I’m too tired to cook meat/veg meals I will order food that fits these requirements because I would rather spend the money than eat cheaper options like pasta or pizza and feel terrible. 

I still get luteal cravings and I treat myself to sweets when I really want them. I don’t restrict myself - I no longer feel the need to. 

Results:

* less fatigue 
* much less cravings (no more binge eating)
* less bloating

# ADHD treatment

I got diagnosed at 23 and started vyvanse. I also learned skills for managing ADHD which led to less burnout during luteal.

When luteal hits, vyvanse feels less effective but still better than without (I tried)

**RESULTS:**

* improved motivation
* better mood 
* vyvanse seems to also help me with sleep

# Supplements:

**Magnesium:**

400mg in capsules before bed. Increase to 600mg during luteal. 

**RESULTS:**

* no more restlessness when trying to fall asleep
* insomnia is very rare now
* as a bonus: helps with luteal constipation 

**Iron:**

I get checked every 4-6 months and take supplements/ eat more high iron foods if low

Anemia makes my symptoms so much worse so keeping this is check made a big difference

**RESULTS:**

* better mood
* much less fatigue

# Conclusion

I still have PMDD, but it's manageable and doesn't spiral into something that continues after luteal ends. I just accepted that I need extra care and give it to myself.  I also realized that the severity of my PMDD is a reflection of how I am doing overall and use it to check in with myself. Finally, being open with friends and family about PMDD is also a relief. I can communicate my needs better and get support. I'm feeling better than ever and free from the cycle of hopelessness I was trapped in for so many years.

1g6p03q,https://www.reddit.com/r/SpecialtyCoffee/comments/1g6p03q/carbonic_maceration/,Carbonic Maceration,"One of the most exciting recent discoveries is the explosion of ""carbonic maceration"" in coffee processing. A technique borrowed from the wine industry. This process creates a controlled fermentation environment inside tanks filled with carbon dioxide, resulting in an intense transformation of the beans.

The flavor profiles that emerge are wildly unique: think exotic fruits, bright acidity, and a refined sweetness that almost redefines what coffee can be. This technique is turning heads in competitions and specialty cafés worldwide, offering a sensory experience that feels closer to tasting a tropical fruit salad than a traditional coffee.

The big question is, are we ready to embrace coffee as more than just a daily ritual but as an evolving culinary art?

Carbonic maceration coffee is bold, polarizing, and it challenges even the most seasoned coffee drinkers. What’s your take on this new wave of coffee experimentation? Have you experienced these flavors yet, or are you sticking to your usual brew?

User: Hawa “Hawk” Tuah Ros binti Ratna

A Malaysian shooting instructor known for her accuracy regarding faraway targets and airborne targets, as if she has the powerful eyes of a hawk. 

Her Stand came to be during a work accident involving Stand users, effectively fusing her with the guns. Despite this, she doesn’t seek revenge - she doesn’t even know her Stand is caused by other Stand users fooling around to begin with. 

Appearance: Phenomenon, integrated

Stats:
* Power: B
* Speed: C
* Range: A
* Durability: A
* Precision: A
* Potential: C

Ability: Human Gun

The accident gave Hawa the powers of a gun. 

Her eyes have now become sniper scopes, which she can consciously adjust the vision range of, and resets once she relaxes her eyes. 

She can now shoot from her mouth by spitting, each spit-bullet acting like actual bullets in terms on speed, range and damage factor. She usually acts like a revolver where she can only shoot 6 spit-bullets before needing 30 seconds to “reload”, but depending the current volume of liquid in her mouth her firing speed and loaded ammo changes. That means she can actually fight back against kidnappers or pickpockets via spitting on them. 

Different drinks affects the properties of the bullets. Carbonated drinks leave corrosive puddles if they don’t hit the target, tea and coffee heal the target instead of hurting them, juice makes the target sticky and therefore slower, and alcohol makes the target drunk. 

The spit-bullets are especially strong against airborne targets. One shot is sufficient to make an airborne target lose balance and fall to the ground, and flying targets receive more damage from the bullets. 

Phlegm also acts like bullets with the Stand active and explode upon impact with a surface, while vomit acts like tear gas with the Stand. 

In fact, the Uograded form for the Stand, Appetite for Destruction, allows her mouth to shoot anything that fits inside as bullets, including actual bullets.

Great Heat: “Assault Rifle Spit” - Hawa drinks a mouthful of water before forcefully ejecting the water at her target, the water turning into a stream of bullets

Concept: How do I turn the Hawk Tuah meme into a functional Stand?

While waiting for our flight back home, we had a funny ""only in Minnesota"" moment at the MSP airport and thought you all would appreciate it.

For some background: My parents are originally from Minnesota but have since moved to South Carolina. However, when my brother and I were kids, my mom would drive us up to Minnesota every summer for us all stay with our grandparents on their farm. One thing we always looked forward to during those trips was lefse. My mom would spread butter and sugar on it, roll it up, and it became our go-to snack, especially after a long day outside.

Fast forward to now—we recently flew up to Minnesota for a week-long trip to visit family. One of the first things my mom bought when we got to the farm was lefse, of course. We had plans to enjoy those nostalgic lefse rolls during our stay, but the week got busy, and we completely forgot about them.

After a busy week of family time, we found ourselves at the MSP airport grabbing breakfast at Caribou Coffee. While waiting for our food, my mom suddenly exclaims, “Damn it, the lefse!”—realizing we hadn’t eaten any all week. A few people nearby gave us curious looks, but I couldn’t help but laugh and say, “That’s probably the most Minnesotan thing I’ve ever heard.” We all had a good laugh, and I wish I could know what was going through the heads of those around us. 

I figured this story would be lost on my fellow South Carolinians, so I wanted to share it here with you Minnesotans. Hopefully, you can appreciate the humor and maybe even relate!

TL;DR: After a busy family trip to Minnesota, my mom realized in the MSP airport that we forgot to eat the lefse she’d bought, and exclaimed, “Damn it, the lefse!” After, we had a good laugh about the situation.",61,1729275647.0,minnesota,17,0.86,False

1g6ovxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/poker/comments/1g6ovxe/a_slice_of_luck_weekend_adventures_with_pizza/,"A Slice of Luck: Weekend Adventures with Pizza, Poker, and Friends","The alarm went off. “Huh? What? Why didn’t my roommates wake me?” I groggily thought as I fumbled for my phone. It was Saturday. Everyone must have woken up early and left. I shrugged, grabbed my robe, and headed downstairs for breakfast. A bowl of cereal and a cup of coffee would do the trick to wake me up.

Still half-asleep, I noticed a string of texts from my friend Jack. “Meet up with Craig and me for pizza around 3? Maybe casino afterward?” he asked. Craig lived on pizza—he had it at least four times a week. We always went to the same shop because the owner had agreed to Craig’s quirky request: a large, well-done, thin-crust cherry pizza. Craig had prepaid for enough cherries to last the whole year, just to make sure they’d always have them.

“Yeah, sure, I’ll be there,” I replied. “Not sure about the casino though—kinda losing its appeal.” Jack shot back with, “See you then,” and that was it. Silence.

I finished my breakfast and started getting ready. After a quick shower, I threw on a pair of stretchy jeans and my favorite hoodie. Fall weather always put me in a good mood—cool enough for layers, but not too cold. I turned on the TV while I tidied up from breakfast, but there was nothing good on. With some time to kill before pizza, I decided to clean my room, though it didn’t need much. I like keeping my space neat. Living with three roommates, we had a decent-sized place, and with everyone contributing to rent, it was manageable.

After finishing up my room, I still had some time before meeting Jack and Craig, but I didn’t feel like sitting around. I decided to take the long way to the pizza shop, driving through some scenic back roads in my truck.

When I walked into the pizza shop, I spotted Jack and Craig already sitting at a table with two large pizzas in front of them. I bought a Vanilla Coke at the counter, then grabbed a seat.

“What’s up?” Jack asked, sliding two slices my way. “Take a couple. I’m not that hungry today.”

Craig plopped a slice of his signature cherry pizza onto my plate. “Thanks,” I said, biting into it. “So, you guys heading to the casino after this?”

“Yeah,” Jack replied. “I got some slot cash in the mail this week, and I might play some craps and blackjack too.”

“I’ll come,” I said, even though the idea didn’t thrill me. “Maybe I’ll play a little poker.”

We made quick work of the pizza while chatting about the casino. Afterward, we left the shop—me in my truck, and Craig and Jack following in Jack’s SUV.

When I go to the casino, I always valet my truck. Jack, on the other hand, uses the standard guest parking, so we usually have to find each other inside. Once we regrouped, Jack mentioned that he wanted to play craps but didn’t want his slot cash to expire, so he loaded a machine for Craig to play.

“I’m gonna go play some 1/3 poker,” I said, and we all split up to do our thing.

The poker room was starting to get busy, and 1/3 No Limit Hold’em was the lowest game available. I bought chips at the cage and put my name on the list. Habitually, I always do things in the same order. After my initials were called, I took my seat and put my $100 buy-in on the table—a neat stack of $5 red chips.

About ten minutes in, I raised to $15 with Ace-Ten suited and got two callers. The flop came, and I was first to act. Holding a flush draw, I pushed all-in. One player called, the other folded. By the river, I hit my flush. My opponent mucked his hand without showing, and the dealer slid the pot my way. I tipped $7, partially as a nod to Jack, who was off playing craps. I don’t fully understand the rules of craps, but I know 7 is a pivotal number—either making or breaking a lot of bets.

I played for another 15 minutes, folding most hands, then decided I wasn’t feeling it and cashed out. The weekend wasn’t something I took too seriously; it was more about hanging out and relaxing.

I found Craig still glued to the slot machine. “Hit anything good?” I asked.

“Not bad,” Craig grinned. “Got two bonuses, and I’ve doubled up with this cash-out ticket. Plus, I’ve got $15 still in the machine.”

A cocktail waitress passed by, and I ordered a coffee while Craig grabbed a water. She brought them over quickly, and Craig started explaining how the slots worked, pointing out all the wilds, paylines, and symbols. It was a lot to take in, and I had a hard time keeping up. I sipped my coffee and watched him play, his credits bouncing up and down for about an hour. Eventually, he lost the $15 left in the machine, but he still had an $80 ticket.

“Let’s go find Jack,” I suggested. “This machine’s gone cold.”

As we walked over to the craps tables, I heard the dealer call out, “Out seven!” followed by a chorus of groans. We spotted Jack, who waved us over. “Be right there!” he called, finishing up his bets.

A few minutes later, Jack joined us. “Had a good roll,” he said. “Had $600 on the table when the seven came, but I still managed to walk away with $300 after being down for a bit.”

Craig showed Jack his $80 cash-out ticket and told him I had won small at poker. Jack grinned and said, “Keep it, Craig. You covered me for the RC racing the other week.”

“Thanks, man,” Craig said, pocketing the ticket.

With that, we called it a day. It was a fun Saturday, and all three of us managed to walk out ahead—a rare feat at the casino. Who knows what next weekend will bring, but for now, we were all content.",0,1729275459.0,poker,3,0.25,False

I can describe my relationship with my wife: we love each other, we share some common interests but also each have our own interests independent of each other, there is mutual trust, we enjoy making each other laugh, we disagree pointedly on politics, etc. She is my ride-or-die life partner, and I'm hers.

I can describe my relationship with my brother, my boss, my neighbor, even my dog.

What they all have in common is that they interact with me. I do or say things and they react; they do or say things and I react. There is dialogue (yes, even with the dog). They are all PHYSICALLY present, though I don't think physical presence is a criteria for having a relationship as I have a relationship with a friend I met online whom I've never met in person, but we have spoken often by phone, Skype and chat.

For my ""relationship with God"", there is no interaction. I can ""talk to him"" (more accurately I can talk AT him) through prayer, but it's never a dialogue. I can do things that presumably make him happy, like working to help abused children, and I can do things that presumably disappoint him, but there is no response to either of those things.

Some would say that I need to be attuned to the world around me to ""see/hear"" God's responses, but I've found that approach entirely unreliable. Using that philosophy, I unerringly misunderstand what I think God is telling me, usually to my own detriment. And that's assuming he's saying anything to begin with, which is not assured.

Sure, I can understand him better through what is said about him in the Bible, but I can also understand Thomas Jefferson better by reading a biography of him. That isn't the same as me having a relationship with Jefferson.

I can describe what I am IN RELATION TO God, but that's like describing where I'm standing in relation to the coffee table. Not the same thing.

I've seen some people with ADHD have mentioned getting more sleepy with caffeine so I'm wondering if that's also the case with me.   ",2,1729275125.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False
