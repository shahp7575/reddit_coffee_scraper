1gng3qq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1gng3qq/wifi_sucks_am_i_overreacting_help_me_fix_it/,"Wifi sucks, am I overreacting? HELP ME FIX IT ","I have severe buyer‚Äôs remorse and feel like I threw my money away. My Wi-Fi constantly lags when I move from one AP‚Äôs area to another, and the overall coverage is worse than my previous system. Now, I need triple the APs!



I had a perfectly working Orbi 860 setup, but I convinced myself I needed Ubiquiti simply because I wanted their cameras, which required a gateway. With such a strong fanbase, I jumped on the bandwagon. Now, I‚Äôm afraid to hop off, but the ride has been disappointing.



Before getting into all the details, my main concern is that, with my previous system, it worked well with APs placed on the floor or desk, providing wide coverage in all directions. Now, with the U7 system, it feels mostly directional, requiring more APs and careful placement. Can I have a properly functioning system using wall-mount APs and a desktop AP?

( I disabled fast roaming and BSS transition at the direction of an installer, is this my problem??)

With the wall-mount APs, I feel forced to buy one for each room. Without being able to use ceiling-mounted APs, I‚Äôm limited in terms of coverage. If I had a ceiling-mounted AP, it would likely cover not just the room it‚Äôs in, but also the surrounding rooms and potentially the floor below.



I have a two-story house that is 2,500 sq ft. Previously, I had one Orbi on the first floor, centrally located, and one on the second floor in my bedroom because placing it in the hallway was awkward. I never experienced lag or issues anywhere. The first-floor router even covered most of my exterior and the basement, which I now realize I took for granted.



Currently, I have 5 APs but fear I may need even more:



	1.	A U7-Pro wall mount in the basement, which works perfectly throughout the open space, but as I walk upstairs, it lags during the transition to the first-floor AP and sometimes disconnects.

	2.	Two APs on the first floor: a U7-Pro in the living room placed on my coffee table, facing up, since I can‚Äôt mount it on the ceiling there. It works great while I‚Äôm in the living room. I didn‚Äôt opt for wall-mounting because the back would face the hallway, leaving that area without coverage. There‚Äôs also a U7-Pro wall-mounted in my office, which should cover the kitchen next door but frequently disconnects and lags (possibly due to a chimney between the two rooms, though it‚Äôs only 5 feet wide). Additionally, the bathroom on the first floor always lags and disconnects, even though the U7-Pro in the living room is only 18 feet away.

	3.	One AP on the second floor, which was originally in my bedroom, but coverage was poor for the second bedroom. I moved it to the hallway, which improved coverage for the other room but reduced speeds in my bedroom. I‚Äôm now considering adding a ceiling-mounted U7-Pro in the hallway and keeping the wall-mounted one near my bedroom.

I (30f) Have in the past had a experience on the kinky site , where a woman PMed me and asked me to keep her husband company while he was in town on buisness. 

Through thorough discussion , her consent and keeping in contact with her throughout before playtime ,it was a yes all around for everyone involved (at the time I was single and trying new things) 

Once everything was done the women to a lesser extent but her husband to the extreme were wanting to know who I was seeing and her husband in particular was getting a bit jealous when I  would mention i would be going on a simple coffee date. It got to the extent when they would ask what day/time and if the guy was good in comparison to the husband. From my understanding of the situation and what was discussed , I could lead my life and they lead theirs and it was just a super casual arrangement as we live in separate cities . At that time also I got into a relationship and had communicated that to both of them and left it like that and would ignore messages after they kept messaging me knowing i was  with someone at that point .

Recently they have contacted me again (after a year apsrt) and I've been asking the right questions this time and have been clear that I am single and I will be seeing people and doing things casually if anything where to go forward. 

The wife had a go at me for dropping off the scene when at the time I got into a relationship and I said I was officially seeing someone. And her husband had expressed interest in having a relationship of sorts

Sadly, after two months, the machine started randomly pouring coffee or grinding by itself. I tried to ask for customer support, but they don‚Äôt have it in Europe since Breville is sold as Sage by another third-party seller, I guess.  
So basically, now I need to replace it as I got reimbursed.  
I saw some people decided to separate the grinder from the machine; maybe that's the best option?

What do you guys advise as a replacement?

Hey Reddit fam, it's Derek here, aka u/solopassions! üôå As a self-proclaimed wanderlust addict, I recently embarked on a last-minute solo trip that turned out to be one of the most exhilarating experiences of my life. Picture this: me, a travel newbie, armed with nothing but a backpack, a bargain flight ticket, and an insatiable thirst for adventure. Let's dive into the quirky chaos and unexpected joys that come with flying solo! üéí‚úàÔ∏è

**The Good, the Bad, and the Unexpected:**
From getting lost in translation while asking for directions (Note to self: ""Donde esta el ba√±o?"" doesn't work everywhere) ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüöΩ, to accidentally joining a local festival where I ended up learning a traditional dance (nailed it... kind of), my solo escapades were filled with those ""Did that really just happen?"" moments. The beauty of solo travel is embracing the spontaneity and leaving your comfort zone in the dust! üöÄüíÉ

**Adjusting My Travel Lens:**
Traveling alone changed my perspective in ways I never imagined. It taught me the art of savoring moments, whether it was sipping coffee at a quaint caf√© where time seemed to stand still or silently absorbing the sunset on a secluded beach. I became my own best company, found confidence in solitude, and even discovered the joy of mispronouncing foreign words with flair. üòÑ‚òïÔ∏è

**Tips from a Solo Travel Enthusiast:**
1. **Pack Light, Travel Happy:** Make a checklist of essentials (and stick to it). Packing light means less stress and more freedom to navigate new places! üéí
2. **Flexibility is Your Friend:** Be open to changing plans and following new trails. Unexpected adventures are often the most memorable! üåà
3. **Stay Safe and Savvy:** Always share your itinerary with someone you trust and stay informed about local customs. Safety first, fun second! üõ°Ô∏è
4. **Embrace the Little Things:** Take time to journal, meditate, or simply breathe in the moment. Solo travel is as much about inner exploration as it is about outer adventures. ‚úçÔ∏èüßò‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Thinking about taking the solo plunge? Do it! Embrace the thrill, the chaos, and the beauty of seeing the world through your own eyes. Trust me, the experiences and stories you'll collect are worth every moment of the unknown. Who knows, you might just discover a hidden piece of yourself along the way! üåç‚ú®

Catch you on the flip side, fellow travelers!

I enjoy nice things, so if I‚Äôm interested in a woman, she‚Äôs going to eat where I eat, sleep where I sleep (luxury hotels), and travel where I travel. I posted that I live in Manhattan and earn over $200k to give some context, especially when comparing myself to a woman I met while visiting Medell√≠n last month. Some people accused me of trying to flex.

Keep in mind, I normally hang out on WallStreetBets, where $200k and living in NYC are pretty standard. Just Google ""Loss Porn"" and you‚Äôll see people posting pictures of themselves losing tens of thousands of dollars in the stock market, which puts things in perspective.

I try to elevate women, give them experiences they‚Äôve never had. I‚Äôm talking about things like a private 3-day cruise down the Nile in Egypt (it‚Äôs not actually private; the boat holds about 12 people), Michelin-star restaurants, zip-lining in Dubai.

THIS WEEK I MANAGED TO BAN 13 Players, that visibly used Maphack. If anyone interested how i know they maphack, i can make a video about it. How does that sound?

  
I‚Äôm excited to kick off my Ko-fi page and share my mission with you all. Every day, I dedicate time to reporting cheaters in the games we love. Cheating ruins the experience for honest players, and I believe every gamer deserves a level playing field. By reporting cheaters and helping game devs maintain a fair environment, I'm doing my part to make sure the fun stays balanced and competitive.  
  
But this work takes time‚Äîresearching, reporting, and ensuring the right people get flagged. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve started this Ko-fi, to ask for your support. If you've ever been frustrated by unfair play or just want to help keep the gaming world honest, consider buying me a coffee!

How can I explain this to her?,"So, here‚Äôs the situation: I‚Äôm 21M, and I have a very close girl best friend, also 21. We‚Äôve known each other for almost four years now. When we first met, we were both in relationships. I had a rough relationship with my girlfriend, and she was with a boyfriend who didn‚Äôt seem to care much. Eventually, we both ended up single.

I started developing feelings for her about a year and a half ago. When our friends go on trips, they often ‚Äúship‚Äù us, saying we‚Äôd make a great couple. New people in our friend group even assume we‚Äôre dating sometimes.

We often hang out, just the two of us, grabbing coffee or eating at her favorite restaurants. We laugh, shop, and make great memories together. It‚Äôs always hard to say goodbye‚ÄîI just want to spend a few more hours close to her. We tell each other everything, and I feel like she‚Äôs the one person I can always talk to.

A few months ago, I admitted that I had feelings for her. She suggested it might be because our friends are always pairing us up, so I nervously agreed, even though I knew my feelings were genuine. Nothing changed in our friendship after that; we still talk as we always have. Sometimes, she mentions that she‚Äôs not ready for a relationship and needs time, but I think about her constantly. I go through our selfies and can‚Äôt help but think how beautiful she is.

One day, she joked that if we‚Äôre still single in our 30s, we should get married. I don‚Äôt know if she meant it seriously or not. I feel stuck because I can‚Äôt tell her outright that I love her. I don‚Äôt want to risk losing this precious friendship, especially if she still feels unready for a relationship.

First off I‚Äôd like to say I‚Äôve done therapy & I don‚Äôt enjoy it. I didn‚Äôt feel I could get the right feedback on how to handle my current position, so here it is. 

Much love ‚ù§Ô∏è

I‚Äôm 27YO Male who a year ago was dumped in Nashville & was forced to either make the changes to treat a girl I was with for 5 years better or to stay the same & continue being an abusive low life scum. 

We both moved into separate places after the split in Nashville & did radio silence for a month, before seeing each other again. 

Every single day leading up to the breakup I began turning the wheels of commitment to be all I can be. 

After the month we began seeing each other again & wow‚Ä¶ it was like the honey moon phase all over. 

My company began doing well in Nashville after we split, my personal health both mentally & physically excelled incredibly. 
I had a 6 pack abs, was applying myself in every way possible to be better for her, to her & proving my will to change for the better for our potential future. 

From 3:30a.m.-7:30p.m. 6 days a week it was a grind from hell‚Ä¶ 

After 3 months then of pure change through the fire of loss & realization, I was looking unstoppable & she was glowing with me‚Ä¶.

Then‚Ä¶ one cold fall morning I get a call from an ex CEO I did a lot of work for in Nashville. 

He offered $15,000 that didn‚Äôt need paid back, paid off my lease to move, a $200,000-$300,000 position in Chicago, but the catch was I had to move in 5 business days from the moment of that phone call‚Ä¶.. 

My god gives me options, but makes me pay with potential growth through pain. 

In Nashville for those 3 months I began feeling myself become overwhelmed with the brutal schedule of hard labor & hard personal growth.

I had to work my absolute ass off to just get to 100k in Nashville. I didn‚Äôt feel valued in that market for work, so this offer was a godsend gift to true rehabilitation. 

So that day I setup a date night with her to drop the news‚Ä¶. 

We went out & I told her‚Ä¶ I could see her eyes‚Ä¶ the defeat‚Ä¶ the loss she knew she was about to incur knowing I‚Äôm not longer 20 minutes down the road‚Ä¶ 

Little did she know.. I wanted her more than life itself, but I knew if I made this move & gave myself some true isolated personal growth that I could come back in the future & carry her home to the end of time. 

It wasn‚Äôt very healthy for my personal growth staying there as the only reason I moved to Nashville was to be with her, so all the memories there were just memories of us‚Ä¶ so I made the move. 

We had a peaceful breakup, she even helped me move to Chicago & drove a Uhaul behind me, stayed here for a few nights‚Ä¶ then we haven‚Äôt seen each other since that last night of March 13th this past year. 

I asked her to come visit for the 4th of July & initially she said yes, but as time grew closer.. she didn‚Äôt want to, so I spent another holiday night alone feeling empty. 

I then waited & offered her to visit for Halloween‚Ä¶ same thing. Initially she said yes, then withdrew as time grew closer‚Ä¶ spent that alone too. 

I never over extended or came off needy, we haven‚Äôt talked on the phone but I text her from time to time & we have ongoing conversation that‚Äôs light & with good intentions. 

Since we have been split I have gone out of 8 dates. Each one better than the last!(: 

It‚Äôs so fulfilling seeing a morning text the night after a night from the date, saying it was a perfect evening. I grew fixated with treating women the best I can, regardless of my mood. 

I know I have options, but after all those dates‚Ä¶ I knew It was all to better myself for me & to help get the one girl I really want in my life. 

SO NOW, here I am. Financially solid, looking good, feeling good‚Ä¶ but haven‚Äôt wanted to go out or be social now for a couple months‚Ä¶ going out on dates & meeting people doesn‚Äôt sound fulfilling anymore. 

I really want another shot with my ex, so I even considered moving when my lease ends here this upcoming March & going back to Nashville. 

I have a portfolio that I manage. I‚Äôve 4 years experience managing a portfolio & by next March I‚Äôll have enough $$ to day trade for a living comfortably. Never needing to work again. 

If it does fail, it would suck but it‚Äôs okay.  I‚Äôm a proven tradesman with connections in 4 states. I‚Äôll always have work. 

I don‚Äôt tell her much about my situation & she has no idea the shit I forced myself through for me & her to be who I am today‚Ä¶ 

2 days ago I broke a few week silence & dropped a funny// affectionate good morning text with some $$$ for her to get some coffee etc for her morning. 

I don‚Äôt want to be forgotten & I worry she will find someone else. 

She‚Äôs absolutely drop dead gorgeous‚Ä¶ has a PHD, speaks 3 languages‚Ä¶ the whole package‚Ä¶.. 

She‚Äôs always had 100 guys on hold, so now I worry I‚Äôll be just another page in a book for a lesson‚Ä¶. 

I don‚Äôt want that, but I also want to be rational & come at this correct. 

I have family in Alabama & Ohio, so Nashville is a perfect medium for me. 

Given what information you have here‚Ä¶. What do I do?‚Ä¶ I haven‚Äôt given Chicago a fair shot, tbh I‚Äôve just been praying to my god 
& working on myself too long that now it‚Äôs time to put the wheels in motion‚Ä¶ 

Do I go ahead & lightly begin laying the seeds with her for a march move back to Nashville next year? 

There‚Äôs a chance there‚Äôs someone else she‚Äôs been seeing, but that‚Äôs up to her & that‚Äôs totally okay if she‚Äôs happy. It would crush a bit, but ultimately if she‚Äôs happy I am too. 

I can add more context on any comments on details I‚Äôve left out.

I just had a rough couple of days, taking care of kids, doing house repairs and having weak sleep, unable to fall asleep when necessary. 

I went to a gas station on my way to work, filled up and used a birthday coupon for a free coffee I was looking forward to for a week since my birthday. I thought it's gonna be a quick stop but when I got ahold of the special cup, I thought to myself ""fuck that, I'm gonna enjoy it."" I sat there on the sofa, decompressing and enjoying that sweet cappuccino. It's something very unlike me, especially because my colleague had to wait for me to exchange shifts for 10 extra minutes. I'm a punctual guy, always on time and expecting the same of others, but something in me just snapped and I felt the need to take time with my treat, the light at the end of a tunnel.

Hope it helps someone. ,"So, relationships, or loneliness. Alas, not everyone can so easily and simply choose one thing, sometimes it is a coincidence. I'm almost 32 years old, divorced. I had a wonderful wife, we divorced when I was 27, we were together a little - about 3-4 years.  I've also had some pretty good girlfriends. But now I'm single again. Does it scare me? Absolutely not. Although sometimes when I drink coffee and smoke (I don't recommend it to anyone), I think about how cool it would be if I were with someone right now. I'm an ISTP kind of person. It's pretty hard for me to just meet a girl like that. Not because I'm stupid, or not pretty. Speaking of which, I wasn't the first guy in high school. I was more of a hermit. Now I am attracted to quite beautiful girls, but I have other problems in life because of which I do not allow myself to enter into a relationship because my bar is just above average. Requirements to myself and naturally to the girl. Although on the other hand, I cook well, dress well, know quite a lot, write music, excellent at various techniques (and confidently hold in his hands any instrument), like to philosophize - if briefly, I will never be lost. But the funny thing is, you can be 1000 times, good, or the best. But if you don't notice simple things sometimes..... it's going to be hard. Not all girls who are super pretty only need money and entertainment - empathy, alas men like me are kind of harsh and like fathers at the same time.

I can be strict and demanding, but also show gentleness. But some things are still incomprehensible to me. Men, don't try to understand a woman with your mind, you have to use your heart. Alas, I repeat, I do it poorly. Yes, they pay attention to me and wait for further actions. And I'm already honestly bored that I need to reacquaint myself, carefully look for points of contact. Sometimes it seems that only in the movies there is that ‚Äúspark‚Äù between people. And wherever they are, this connection will remain. 

Now, no amount of money or beauty will help you keep things the way they are. Beauty is beautiful, even in old age people can be beautiful. But it's also hard. You have to pay for it, diets, sports. Some people even have body surgeries. Too much attention, yes, you can get tired of that too. And money, money can't buy peace of mind. 

I apologize if I hurt anyone's feelings. But the reality is that you have to work hard and persistently on yourself, not only physically, but also spiritually and morally. To figure yourself out. Sometimes we push people away and wonder why things don't work out the way you want them to.

‚ú®Female looking for anyone writing as Male‚ú®

I‚Äôm not at all replacing any current partners but simply looking to add to my writing scenarios and outlets! 


I LOVE a slow burn, all the angst and drama that comes with it, whether that be as a friends to lover trope (one of my favourites!), forbidden love to strangers to lovers just meeting for the first time or a complete difference in personalities, and aesthetics, but with a mutual deep connection and understanding of one another. Simply like say a grumpy x sunshine, black cat x golden retriever, sort of trope; one where on the exterior the male character can appear cut off, a little tough perhaps, and grumpy but with her he‚Äôs so vastly different. He‚Äôs vulnerable, gentle, and understanding; something he isn‚Äôt with just everyone else. She helps him to become softer, much, much more gentle all round, whilst he helps her to become less of a pushover or people pleaser. 

For this scenario, I‚Äôm simply looking to mix the world of fame with romance in very much a Slice of Life way, with lots of slow-burning romance and added drama! - I feel you can never have too much of that and adds a lot to the storyline itself! Something that‚Äôs very much realistic where the writing tugs on your heart strings, after all everything isn‚Äôt always going to be wonderful and happy 100% of the time! It has all the similarities of a general Slice of Life premise with the two characters falling for one another yet with added depth of the implications of their fame and recognition within the public eye. From potential scrutiny of the public themselves - even just the simple grazing of their hands - both on social media and from news outlets, to paparazzi and reporters desperate to follow and generate money from their every move. Whilst falling for one another they have the added pressure of external influences to consider; less privacy and security of that of any other, ‚Äúnormal‚Äù, couple out there within the early stages of their relationship. Those that are able to head out on dates, even just for coffee, without being recognised! It just brings *so* much added drama, which I love!!! There‚Äôs just so many ways to navigate it all which is exciting! 

I have no ‚Äòset in stone‚Äô concepts so that we‚Äôre able to come up with an idea entirely together to ensure we‚Äôre both happy, content and invested in what we‚Äôre writing - after all it is a partnership! Especially as this is *your* character to write as however you please and see for! Particularly so that it‚Äôs your choice entirely as to *why* they are famous. For my character, I am envisioning her as being like this ‚Äòrelatively new onto the music scene‚Äô, but very much high in demand and taking the world of music by storm, kind of pop princess singer songwriter?


For some rough outlines, what line of work is your within? Are they also within that same field of work or entirely opposing careers? From actors, to singers and songwriters, or perhaps more within the athletic department? Why have their paths crossed? Strangers who have met at an event or even perhaps two individuals who have always known of one another? Or perhaps a chance meeting when purposefully brought together for a certain situation, event or work opportunity?

I roleplay in first person and would consider myself to be very detailed and descriptive; so I‚Äôm hoping to find someone of a similar match. I really enjoy a lot of back and forth rapid replies, rather than say one or two messages a week, but of course appreciate that that can‚Äôt always be the case! - just simply that I‚Äôm often able to provide those quick responses, particularly in the evenings, and that I‚Äôm also seeking this in a writing partner too! I‚Äôve been writing overall for around ten years; including with the same writing partner during that timeframe until the start of the year - so I‚Äôm well versed within the longevity of writing with the same partner hahahaha! 

Please let me know if you‚Äôre interested by private message, leaving behind your age too - as again I‚Äôm only looking to write with someone of a similar age range - also leaving behind a little information and some insight into what your own interests and any ideas you may have!

I‚Äôve been there for ‚Äòfriends‚Äô through some really tough times. For instance I had a friend who lost all of her own peers because of bullying, so I went out with her, bought her coffee and checked up on her every week or so, but as soon as her own group apologised, she went straight back to clubbing with them and hasn‚Äôt spoken to me since (it‚Äôs been months now).

One thing after another has gone wrong on our plans for his brother's wedding. Currently he's spending time getting his dad's suit tailored because the suit rental company they went to sent the wrong color suits (they need navy blue not black and it's a cultural thing). He's been feeling overwhelmed and pissed off for a couple days. I've been trying to do small things to help, but at the moment I can't do much since all of the focus is on his brother and fiance. We fly back tomorrow night for home, but I know he's still going to be upset after all of this. He's repeatedly said ""why can't just one thing go right"" and it's breaking my heart because he puts so much of himself into everything he does. 

Does anyone have any tips on how to help men relax? How to provide comfort, safety, understanding, etc? Or even small things I can do to take pressure off of him (which I've been doing in some instances like getting us coffee or folding his clothes to fit better in the suitcase while he's out, doing laundry etc).

1gnfiui,https://www.reddit.com/r/disneylandparis/comments/1gnfiui/a_firsttimers_solo_experience_to_disneyland_paris/,"A ""first-timer's"" solo experience to Disneyland Paris","Hi everyone! And Merry christmas (already üòÇ). Let me set the scene first, I'm 26M from Spain with a wild love for themeparks that after my first year of properly saving thanks to a decent paying job I decided to gift myself the """"""full"""""""" Disney experience: 3 days of parks and 2 nights half board in the Sequoia Lodge.

In case you're wondering it: due to the high costs, I couldn't really ask any friend to come join me which gave me tons of time to experience and reflect and is the reason why I'm writing this.

I shall also organise this in sections because I can:

HOTEL
Loved the Sequoia, it gave me the minium comfort I was looking for (complementary coffees and teas, a gym, a decent bathtub) without skyrocketing the price. 

Hotel food:
I must praise the dinner buffet. The meat was superb and it offered quite unusual combinations with well developed flavors. The hotel-made deserts were also top notch. I'm actually feeling quite bad because I saw tons of tables eating sad nuggets and pasta when other choices were actual-restaurant quality. 

On the other side, the breakfast was sad. Was it standard-quality? Yes. Did it fill me up? Yes. But the variety was standard if not limited, the presentation was standard, and the price is not standard so I guess I was just dissapointed. Also forget about any home-made pastries or cakes for breakfast, all 100% industrial. Also for those that enjoy some fruity breakfasts... Not even grapes and we're in season. 

PARKS
They are stunning sets and the detailing is to be praised. I came here for fake historicity and tacky decor and both parks deliver well even while half of both are currently under works. 

This said, they are small, do take that into account. They take tons of space and you'll walk slowly blocked by Disney princess wannabes having their photo taken by, what often seemed, a forcefully disneyfied boyfriend, and very noisy families BUT, there aren't that many rides and actual shows amount to 6 if you count the parades.

The rides are fine but don't expect to be adrenalined if you've visited a couple of other parks before.

From this visit I do leave feeling that Disney expects you to waste a lot of time shopping and waiting for a character photo to even sell the need for a hotel, otherwise you could very well do both parks in a single day. 

Food though... No. Punto. I can't speak of buffets and table services but in food trucks and quick services and snacks: in-park food is sad. Seasonal highlight: the Christmas ""vert'meilleux"" special felt like eating a bunch of shaped nothingness, I commend the creator for coming up with the ultimate flavourless, textureless eatable. 

And last, one pretty much bothering red flag is having to download an app to work out the parks. The paper map is there but has barely no info and most importantly: no timetables. 

STAFF
Im making this section since praising/ranting about the Disney staff seems to be a sport. I have no complaints. The receptionist spoke perfect Spanish -he was from Spain so no real merit there lol- and I was well treated everywhere. I did try opening and speaking in French which did sparkle joy in some of the staff too. 

TBH I'm glad I wasn't greeted by false smiles and overly-welcoming mannerism. I'm all in for a warm bonjour/soir but anything above that I find tacky.

TLDR: Overall, I'd recommend a visit at least once in a lifetime and coming back around every 10 years if you like Disney and themeparks. If you do decide to come I do very much recommend paying extra for a hotel and get the fully packaged experience. ",1,1731174287.0,disneylandparis,3,1.0,False

This week, trip to Costa Rica. Down on first class was also great service. Currently headed back to the US in first.  Opposite situation.  Had to ask for a second cup of coffee. Have not seen the attendant for an hour. Literally. He‚Äôs just sitting up in his jump seat and hasn‚Äôt come around. I shouldn‚Äôt have to chase him down. 

Weirdest first class experience so far. ",1,1731173943.0,AlaskaAirlines,2,0.57,False
1gnfdxe,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1gnfdxe/how_can_i_forget_him_hindi_naging_kami_pero_lahat/,"How can I forget him, hindi naging kami pero lahat ng mga first time ko sa kaniya ko naranasan?","The problem: Gusto ko rin mag share ng experienced ko. So, there's this guy na na-meet ko online, tawagin natin siyang si N, online ko siya na-meet, pero super lapit lang pala namin sa isa't-isa. Parehas kami ng city, and yung university na pinapasukan niya sobrang lapit lang din sa'min, so parang may chance na magkita kami. At first parang nag d-doubt pa'ko na ayain siya mag meet kasi sabi niya hindi raw siya nag e-exist irl, and nahihiya rin ako na makipagkita sa kaniya kasi baka ma turn off siya sa'kin or what. But si God na gumawa ng paraan, I am a choir sa simbahan and I used that opportunity para ayain siya na magsimba with me even tho hindi kami magkasama sa buong misa kasi kumakanta me. Ff, we met, first meet namin sa simbahan. Siya yung pinakaunang guy na mineet ko, first guy na nakasama ko mag night walk and mag coffee, and first guy na nakaalam saan bahay namin. First ever guy rin na nasabihan ko about sa happenings sa pamilya at buhay ko, and first guy who broke my heart. Sabihin na nating siya yung unang guy na nagparanas sa'kin ng mga first times. He even called my name in a unique way na talagang siya lang tumatawag sa'kin ng ganon.

What I've tried so far: After ng first meet namin I thought na hindi na niya ako kakausapin kasi hindi ako attractive in person compared sa ibang babae. But mali me, he continued chatting me, parehas kaming updated sa mga nangyayari sa'min. Palagi siyang nag se-send ng pics niya or video ng mga random happenings sa day niya, ang cute niya huhu! Very comfy na ako kausapin sha, upon talking to each other na-realize namin na super dami pala naming similarities, sa humor, sa likes and dislikes pagdating sa pagkain and etc. As in para lang akong nakikipag-usap sa another me pero boy version, that's why super na-attached ako sa kaniya and I feel like talagang mahuhulog loob ko sa kaniya. But I don't know ano nangyari, bigla na lang siyang hindi nag reply sa chats ko, that time umuulan eh so I thought na baka nawalan lang ng signal. But days hanggang sa nag one week hindi pa rin nag reply si atecco kaya talagang sobrang nag overthink ako. Nasanay akong ikwento sa kaniya mga nangyayari sa araw ko eh, pero ayun, bigla na lang siyang nawala, palagi kong chini-check kung nag reply na ba siya pero wala pa rin. Hindi ako sanay na hindi siya kausap, pinapakinggan ko mga vm's niya para lang ma feel yung presence niya, nag b-br ako para maramdaman ko siya. 

Ff, Sunday morning, talagang paggising ko pagka open ko ng telegram, boogsh wala na, deleted na convos namin, dinelete na niya. üòî That time bigla na lang tumulo luha ko, sobra akong nasaktan. So last, same day sa pag delete niya ng convo namin chinat ko siya. Sinabi ko lahat ng gusto kong sabihin kasi I know na last na 'yon, may galit ako sa kaniya but mas nanaig pa rin yung pag-intindi ko sa reasons niya. Hinayaan ko siyang magpaliwanag, and that's it! Mas lalong nasaktan ang babae sa naging reasons niya, mas lalo ko siyang ayaw i-let go. His reason kung bakit niya ako ghinost kasi na-a-attach na rin daw siya sa'kin, very comfy na rin daw siya, but what really made me feel sad is yung sinabi niya na hindi pa siya ready na pumasok sa isang rs. I was about to reply na willing akong mag wait hanggang sa maging ready na siya kahit super tagal pa, pero hindi ko na tinuloy kasi natatakot ako sa magiging sagot niya. So, kahit na masakit I let him go, siya na unang umalis eh, ayoko man pero wala akong magagawa kasi it's his choice and I think mas better 'yon para sa kaniya. That was our last convo with his last reply na "" I'm sorry:(( "". After that binura niya ulit last convo namin for the 2nd time:((

What advice I need: I want to chat him again kasi I feel like may chance pa, but ayoko at the same time kasi baka ako lang nag-iisip na may second chance pa. I don't know what to do:(



P.S I know his name naman, but not his surname, pero guys nahanap ko account niya sa fb and ig, pero hindi ko na inadd or what. Palagi kong dinadalaw account niya sa facebook and even ig kahit na both naka-locked. Lungkot lang wala akong susi para mabuksan 'yon. Ayoko siyang i-add or follow kasi baka ma-miss ko lang siya sobra, and for his privacy na rin.",1,1731173908.0,adviceph,1,1.0,False
1gnfd7p,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1gnfd7p/dav_spoilers_all_lucanis_romance_feedback/,[Dav spoilers all] Lucanis Romance Feedback Masterpost,"I had the idea to compile a list of the feedback I have and have seen (many recurring times on this sub and other social media) regarding Lucanis‚Äô romance.

First off, the general sentiment is that Lucanis is a great character with lots of potential. At his core I feel like most of us wouldn‚Äôt change anything about his character, but we DO need more content because it feels like we are filling in a lot more blanks than we would have to if we romanced other characters.

Some observations:

* Both the coffee flirt scene and the almost kiss scene as well as the end scene (although not as spicy as the others maybe?) are GREAT.
* But otherwise, flirting is almost not reciprocated at all in Act 1. Why not build a little bit of chemistry before the ‚Äòalmost kiss‚Äô scene by having him at least act a little flustered by Rook‚Äôs flirting? It also wouldn‚Äôt be so bad and could also be explained by his lack of romantic experience‚Ä¶ if he wasn‚Äôt constantly flirting with Neve during Act 1, which is really salt in the wound. Personally, I would prefer if the flirting happened after you locked someone else‚Äôs romance in.

* Why is he locked out of romance when you save Minrathous but Neve isn‚Äôt? Why is he not pissed at Neve for prioritising Minrathous and romances her anyway? What if Rook was a Shadow Dragon? Was she expected to choose him over her hometown? So much of that doesn‚Äôt make any sense, it‚Äôs very frustrating.
* The ‚Äòcommitting‚Äô scene - doesn‚Äôt really feel like committing at all. You mean the barely there flirting and the almost kiss followed by Lucanis remembering your favourite drink and making you dessert means you are now in a committed relationship? Very strange.
* There should be a first kiss somewhere between here or at the end of his mid game personal quests. For instance when he says ‚ÄòI have a better idea how to spend the evening‚Äô at the end of the Ilario questline. Now that Spite is under control, it doesn‚Äôt make sense that there is no kiss when there is for other companions.

Basically, we just want it to be more well rounded and on the same quality level as the other companions, or at least have roughly the same amount of content. For example, more in depth talk about why he was afraid to commit, his true feelings, and more detail into how Spite and how he factors into his relationship.

It would also be amazing if after committing, Lucanis used Antivan terms of endearment during battle barks or when he sees you‚Ä¶ As it stands, after locking in, there‚Äôs barely any acknowledgement that you are in a relationship, and he is the only character who feels like this until the end of the game.¬†

We felt a bit shafted after Lucanis was one of the most marketed companions and we were told romance was at the forefront of this game. Bioware, we are on our knees begging y‚Äôall to update this in a future patch or something‚Ä¶

Please feel free to add your suggestions or feedback in the comments, I will try to edit any missing ones into the post. And share wherever you think will likely reach the devs.",1,1731173851.0,dragonage,3,0.67,False
1gnfcjk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadBedrooms/comments/1gnfcjk/one_of_those_days/,One of those days,"The sadness of it definitely comes in waves. Today is just one of those days where I‚Äôve been thinking about a lot of the past sexual memories my wife (29F) and I (31M) have shared. Woke up so horny from a dream this morning of a sexual memory of my wife and I and it‚Äôs just been getting to me today. 

I miss all the playful sexual things we used to do to each other (ALL THE TIME) and joke and laugh about it. I miss smacking her ass in the kitchen, humping her from behind when she bends over (and vice versa), poking her butthole when she walks up the stairs in front of me. I miss when she used to just grab my dick randomly for a feel, when she used to bite her lip while doing it. She put her hand down my pants and gave me a handjob once while we were walking the dogs at night. I‚Äôll never forget it. Waking up and randomly fucking in the dead of the night or first thing in the morning. I miss undressing each other little by little. I miss tickling her back and legs and feeling how wet she got when she opened them welcoming me to touch. I miss the random nudes she would send me for no reason. I miss when she used to ask me for them cause she was thinking about me. The kinky texts. I have a screenshot of a text she sent me years ago that simply just says ‚Äòwanna have sex tonight?‚Äô followed by a nude and it turns me on so much. I remember one time she got out of the shower, freshly shaved, still wet, and just came up to me and sat on my face. Ugh it was so hot. I can literally still picture it. I LOVE eating her out. She used to give me head while I was playing video games or making dinner or when I walked in the door from work. I miss having spontaneous sex in random places all over the house, on the coffee table, while cooking dinner, in the car fogging up the windows, out in public. We fucked on a beach behind a railroad track on a fallen down tree once and it was amazing cause outdoor sex is one of my kinks. We fucked on her parents kitchen counter once lmao. We went to an art show and got there early and fucked in the car out front of the venue cause she wanted to before we went in. We went for a blunt ride late at night once and she gave me road head cause she couldn‚Äôt wait for me to pull over and bang it out. I miss all that kinky shit we used to do. Nothing is better than some good hot sex with your spouse. I miss how crazy it used to be sometimes. I miss how frequent and natural and easy it was to bond and connect like that. I miss her being the one to initiate a lot of those times too. I miss not needing to masturbate while she is in the house and just not needing to so often. I crave her so badly. She‚Äôs so hot and has a great body and her love is intoxicating. 
 

Sometimes I just really miss how sexual my wife used to be. I felt so wanted and desired by her, like I was the only man on earth. She really is an amazing wife tho don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love her so dearly. Just sometimes I get a little sad thinking about how things used to be sexually between us. Maybe I‚Äôm a bit of a freak but I‚Äôm not a sex addict or anything. I just enjoy sex with my wife. Im a sexual guy. it‚Äôs part of who I am. I know we‚Äôve grown up a bit and things have changed and that‚Äôs okay. I accept that and still give her all my love. She‚Äôs my best friend and I choose her for life for better or worse. If she wanted to be sexual with me like that again I‚Äôd be gladly accepting of it but I don‚Äôt expect it nor do I want her to change anything she doesn‚Äôt want to. Shes making an effort to get herself back to a healthy sexual space again and Im grateful for that. I guess I just miss how SHE really used to want it for herself and how natural it came. It‚Äôs like mourning a loss.

Sorry to be graphic or if this isnt the place for a post like this. I cant talk to my wife about it because I dont want her to feel sad so im posting it here for strangers on the internet lol

1gnfbff,https://www.reddit.com/r/creativewriting/comments/1gnfbff/the_cluttered_truth_feedback_desperately_wanted/,The cluttered truth- feedback desperately wanted,"There is a strange, almost suffocating comfort in the mess. It is the kind that settles in so quietly,
so gradually, that you do not even notice it until it becomes all-encompassing. The clutter is not
just physical, it is an emotional landscape, too. For years, I let it build, unchecked and
unchallenged. I thought the mess was something I could ignore, something that would eventually
fix itself if I could just keep going, keep pretending that everything was fine. But when the mess
inside started to mirror the mess outside, I had no choice but to confront it.
I remember the day it hit me. The house had been growing increasingly chaotic, the papers piling
up, the laundry piling higher, and I could not bring myself to do anything about it. There was
always an excuse. Work was busy. My partner was traveling. The baby needed me. But it was not
just the baby crying anymore, it was the chaos, the disarray in my head and my heart from which
I was running.
The day started like any other. I woke up to the sound of the baby crying, loud and insistent. Her
cries echoed through the apartment, bouncing off the walls as if they knew the mess was there and
wanted to point it out to me. I dragged myself out of bed, numb to the noise, numb to the fact that
I had not had a decent night‚Äôs sleep in months. As I made my way to her crib, stepping over toys,
clothes, and forgotten shoes, I could not help but feel that this was more than just another morning.
The clutter was no longer just annoyance, it was a symbol of everything I was avoiding.
The house was falling apart, and so was I.
The baby kept crying. She did not stop. I picked her up, and her small body curled into mine,
seeking comfort. Her crying, though, felt louder in the silence that followed. My hands trembled
as I tried to rock her to sleep. How could I be a good mother, a good person, when I could not even
keep my house in order?
I had always prided myself on being organized, on keeping things in control. But somewhere along
the way, I had lost myself in the mess. It was not just the baby crying anymore, it was the clutter,
the disorganization, the piles of unopened bills and half-empty cups of coffee scattered around the
apartment. The mess had become a metaphor for my life‚Äîout of control, disjointed, and
overwhelming. I was drowning, and the mess was pulling me under.
I had always been a perfectionist. It was something I had inherited from my mother, who would
wake up early every Saturday to scrub the house from top to bottom, making sure every surface
gleamed with cleanliness. She had taught me that a tidy house reflected a tidy mind. But that was
before life became more complicated. Before the baby. Before the career. Before the world became
a blur of obligations, expectations, and deadlines. I thought that if I could keep things together on
the outside, then everything on the inside would eventually follow. But I was wrong.
The thought echoed in my mind, growing louder as the day went on. It was a nagging voice, like
the baby‚Äôs persistence, demanding attention. I tried to focus, to calm myself, but it felt impossible.
How had I let it get to this point? How had I let everything fall apart without realizing it?
The kitchen was the worst. It used to be a place of warmth, where I would cook meals with love,
invite friends over for dinner, chat while chopping vegetables, and sipping wine. Now it was
cluttered with empty containers, dirty dishes, and receipts from takeout. It was not just physical
mess‚Äîit was emotional mess, too. Every dish that had not been washed, every piece of mail that
had not been opened, every book that had not been read felt like a missed opportunity, a promise
unfulfilled. The kitchen felt foreign to me now, a place I once found joy in that had become an
overwhelming reminder of everything I had neglected.
I walked through the apartment, stepping over books, piles of laundry, forgotten reminders. My
feet moved mechanically, one step after another, but my mind was a whirlwind of thoughts. Was
this really my life? Was this who I had become?
The guilt washed over me like a wave, drowning out the other thoughts. I should have been better.
I should have kept things neat, kept my life in order. Instead, I had allowed everything to become
overwhelming. The laundry sat untouched. The dirty dishes remained, stacked up like my
unspoken feelings. I opened the drawer to toss a stray receipt, and there, buried under the chaos,
was a letter from my mother.
The paper felt strangely heavy in my hand. It was not a new letter. In fact, it was from years ago.
I had never opened it. Why didn‚Äôt I? I do not know. I had been afraid of what I would read. I did
not want to face the feelings that I knew would stir up. I opened it, and the familiar handwriting
brought me back to the past when things were not so complicated, a time when love did not feel
so elusive.
But it was not just the letter that made me pause. It was the weight of the years. The years of
avoidance. The years of pushing people away because I could not deal with the clutter, both
physical and emotional. The years of neglecting the relationships that mattered because I did not
have the energy to fix what was wrong inside me. I could not face the mess, and so I ran from it.
But as I sat there, staring at the letter in my hand, I realized that I was no longer running. The mess
was there, yes. It was overwhelming, it was heavy, but it was also the story of my survival. Every
pile of clothes, every dish, every unopened letter was a testament to how hard I had fought to keep
going, even when it felt like everything was falling apart. The clutter was not just failure, it was
proof that I had lived through it all.
I had let the mess take over because I was scared. I feared what would happen if I faced it. If I
started cleaning, I might have to confront everything I had been avoiding. I might have to confront
the truth about myself, the truth that I was not perfect, that I had made mistakes, that I had neglected
the things that mattered most.
But as I sat in the middle of the mess, the weight of the letter in my hands, I realized that the mess
was not the problem. The problem was that I had been too afraid to look at it, to understand it, to
clean it up. The clutter was not an enemy, it was a part of me, a reflection of everything I had gone
through.
I stood up, suddenly determined. The mess did not define me, but it was part of my story. And if I
was going to move forward, I had to face it, one step at a time. I started with the kitchen, clearing
the counters, putting the dishes in the sink, folding the laundry. It was not much, but it was
something. It was the beginning.
The baby had stopped crying by now. I rocked her gently in my arms, and the soft weight of her
against me brought me back to the present. I did not have all the answers. I did not have everything
figured out. But I knew one thing: I was not going to let the mess control me anymore.
I began to understand that the mess was not just something to be fixed, it was something to be
understood. Every pile of laundry, every piece of paper, every neglected corner of the house was a
piece of my history, my struggle, and my survival. It was not perfect. It was not neat. But it was
mine.
And as I cleared away the clutter, both inside and out, I realized that the mess was not the end of
the journey. It was just the beginning. A beginning not of perfection but of acceptance, of realizing
that I could still move forward despite the chaos. I was no longer defined by the mess. The clutter
was simply the backdrop to a much deeper story. A story of resilience, of learning to accept my
own imperfections, and of finding meaning in the mess.
It was not easy. Some days, the clutter would return. Some days, it would feel like too much again.
But each time it came back, I would remind myself that it was just a part of the process. It was not
a failure, it was a lesson, a reminder of how far I had come.
The mess, in the end, was not the enemy. It was the starting point. It was the place where I learned
to see myself for who I truly was‚Äîflawed, overwhelmed, but still moving forward. The journey
was not about erasing the mess; it was about learning to live with it, to find meaning in it, and to
move through it with grace.
And so, as I looked around my home, no longer overwhelmed by the clutter, I realized that it had
taught me something invaluable: that even in the mess, there is meaning. There is growth. There
is life. And, just maybe, that is enough.",1,1731173714.0,creativewriting,0,1.0,False

Back in the third semester, our groups merged, and this girl joined my class. I found her pretty at first, but I was mostly focused on making friends. This semester, though, I've gotten to know her a bit more, and since a while a started to develop these feelings, and I find myself really drawn to her. We had a language event recently where we each sold items from different cultures (Korean for her, Japanese for us). When I saw her, I felt this genuine urge to tell her she looked beautiful, but the moment didn‚Äôt come up right away. Then, at one point, she came by our stand with a friend, so I made a small gesture, and she responded with a cute smile doing the same.

Later that day, after I got home, she posted a story, so I went ahead and messaged her, telling her genuinely that she looked lovely and that it made me happy to see everyone there. She replied, saying thanks that she though the same and that she also had fun at the event. We chatted a bit about it, and it was nice.

The next day, we had some group conversations, nothing that personal. By the night she posted about feeling sad over something involving a cat, so I sent her a message, encouraging her not to feel guilty about her empathy. She thanked me and admitted she sometimes feels silly for being so emotional.

Honestly, I‚Äôve never felt this way before‚Äîconstantly thinking about her and the possibility of something more. We‚Äôre both in a similar situation, as neither of us has been in a relationship. I‚Äôm thinking of chatting with her casually over this month, and, if all goes well, maybe asking her out for coffee before winter break. Sorry if this sounds naive and loong, but any advice?

Its always just been myself (F20) and my mother (F56) my whole life, you know the regular gist of it - I acted as her best friend and therapist, any feelings she held she took it out on me and came to me for advice if she wasn‚Äôt angry. I was too young to understand but also expected to understand and predict how to help her in any way she needed. Just for the vibe of our relationship her favourite sayings were - we can‚Äôt both be upset at the same time (spoiler it wasn‚Äôt really allowed to be me), I am the adult and your mother you‚Äôre the child, \[to me\] you‚Äôre amazing I‚Äôm glad someone is the adult around here. She was very caring and I love her but money was tough and she didn‚Äôt have a fleshed out support network. We moved around a lot when I was younger (14 times as of current) and I got a job at 13 to help with the finances.

In the last 3 years or so my mother‚Äôs mental health was impacted by something and she took a pretty quick mental decline, because of this I had to take on more than usual i had at 16. I won‚Äôt go into it but it‚Äôs stopped her from being able to work except doesn‚Äôt qualify her for disability until it progresses further (which it has kind of stabilised so we may never reach that point), think the memory loss and delirium associated with earlier dementia - but not that. At 17 we got evicted and we were staying with friends for a bit until I found us a place to rent.

Once I graduated I started university and working 2-3 jobs, after the first year though I was able to drop down to 1 secure job full-time, of course also studying full time it‚Äôs been difficult, I lost my scholarship and dropped classes so it has prolonged my degree. As it stands now, I cover rent and bills as much as I can and just have her transfer me what she has left of her payments at the end of the month. I have forms ready for when I need to act as her power of attorney and I am trying to get her to all her appointments to keep her health on track, I‚Äôm also trying to stay on top of all the household things like cooking for us, cleaning, and appointments for myself/studying and catching up on classes I don‚Äôt attend.

Shout out to my landlord because rent has gone up too high now and we will have to move again now and I‚Äôm really stuck. I know logically I need to stay and help her even if that means moving further away that where we currently live to have upwards of a 1.5hr public transport commute to both work and university, but frankly I just want to be on my own. And I feel guilty and evil for it, but I just want to run. I‚Äôve watched friends and family get into relationships, make plans, go on trips, have the emotional bandwidth for parties and work drama but deep down I just down have the time or energy for any of it, let alone the funds. I do my best to catch up with my friends and go out to eat or whatever I can budget it, before you say do free things - we do - but our city is quiet and at 21 I want to party and see them socially like others my age, the expected coffee and a walk. 

If we split up I can‚Äôt make sure she‚Äôs taking care of her self (which for the most part she‚Äôs okay to but she has episodes of just simply doesn‚Äôt for weeks and spends all her money into the negative), and I don‚Äôt even think I can afford to keep us in separate places even if it puts me closer to work and school. But I feel so stuck and alone and like I can‚Äôt be myself or talk to anyone about it because who would empathise for the girl trying to move away from her concerning mum. But having to act as the adult all the way up until actual adulthood, and then having to become my mums only care system as well as support system has eroded me to a breaking point. I would never say this in my personal life because I am fiercely protective of her because they‚Äôve always thought she wasn‚Äôt the best mother but she‚Äôs vulnerable and always full of love.

I have worked so hard to keep us together since childhood so she wouldn‚Äôt be alone or even feel alone but at this point I am exhausted. I keep wanting my ‚Äòmum‚Äô but every time I seek support it‚Äôs just not there, at least when I was younger I still had some semblance of adult and safety now I just feel lost and scared. I can see myself growing resentful to literally everything and everyone around me and I know it‚Äôs unhealthy but I‚Äôm just so jealous that they get to do things without the constant concern for everything in life.

I know this isn‚Äôt quite a typical parentification experience but it feels like I‚Äôve been locked into what I wanted to be free of for years, for the rest of my life. I feel so guilty for even feeling this way because she loves me so much and I love her, I just feel so disconnected and alone in everything now. Any words of wisdom appreciated but no pressure at all!¬†

Thanks to anyone who took the time to read this shitstorm. I haven‚Äôt spoken about this before and it‚Äôs currently 2am so please forgive me if it‚Äôs a bit dishevelled I‚Äôve been looking at real estate websites.¬†",1,1731173263.0,Parentification,0,1.0,False

# Lore

Following the 2nd Intifada and 2nd Lebanon war, the IDF's armored units were worried that the new and cheap Anti-tank weapons would make the concept of Armored fighting vehicle obsolete, so in collaboration with various Israeli high-tech companies they developed an AI and installed it on a Merkava 4M tank, the now-sentient vehicle immediately began developing ambitions for a ""Tanko-cratic"" empire, and in 2018 the AI-possessed tank was successfully elected as the new Prime minister of Israel thanks to its charisma and the promise of ending the Israeli-Arab conflict for good.

After becoming Prime minister, the sentient Merkava began installing its AI into all tanks that were (and still are) in service. Not too long afterwards the Palestinians rose up again in a 3rd Intifada, the Tank PM's response? quite literally flattening the West bank and Gaza strip in a borderline Genocidal campaign, because the AI used for the tanks was designed to be completely devoid of morals and regard to international law. following this campaign the entire world (even the US) condemned Israel and threatened to intervene. 

But they had to stop speaking up when Pakistan's entire nuclear arsenal was detonated inside their silos after they threatened to nuke Israel if they don't stop. As it turned out, the AI-controlled tank successfully hacked into Pakistan's nuclear warheads and triggered them to blow up, killing untold millions of people and contaminating large portions of the country.

But that didn't deter Jordan, Egypt, Syria, Iraq, Lebanon, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia from declaring war on Israel, which ultimately resulted in them (the Arab countries) getting literally flattened in the same fashion as their Palestinian brethren. While the Syrian and Iraqi portions of Kurdistan rebelled against their long-time oppressors, got independence, and became an Israeli ally.

The remaining gulf states united into a federation after Saudi Arabia's downfall, and to foster good relations with them, Israel has ceded a swath of land to connect the UAE and Qatari portions of the new state.

After Turkey tried to invade the new Kurdish state, the Tankocratic Israeli Empire intervened and invaded Southeastern turkey, successfully reunifying all Kurds (except those in Iran) and directly annexed Hatay (part of Syria until the 30s) from Turkey.

As of today (11/8/2024) there have been multiple assassination attempts on the Tank emperor, all failed due to the sentient vehicle's active protection systems that allowed it to outsmart ATGM. Tensions with Iran are rising rapidly due to Azerbaijan allying with Israel, the local Kurds and Azeris wanting to secede and join their respective nations, and the general animosity between the Israeli and Iranian governments, will a war between the 2 strongest nations in the middle east erupt? or will diplomacy eventually prevail? only time will tell...

Lucanis - drinks coffee so he doesn't fall asleep and get controlled by Spite

Neve - Also drinks coffee (crappier one) so she can stay focused on her cases

Bellara - doesn't sleep because she can't stop thinking about stuff(don't really remember the context, I think something related to troubleshooting the archive) - also mentions having trouble sleeping after she meets her brother

Harding - Doesn't sleep because she now has dreams and it freaks her out

Davrin (also Warden Rook) - Mentions not  sleeping because they hear the Calling

Rook - egg is there when they dream 

Taash -? (probably doesn't sleep to spite their mom idk) 

Emmrich - didn't hear anything related to sleeping, most likely sleeps like a baby with Manfred singing him a lullaby

I like this guy, but it‚Äôs complicated. I‚Äôm not single, but I haven‚Äôt really acted on my feelings towards him other than talking to him. But I believe he may also be in a relationship. I met his girlfriend this past April at a law school event, but haven‚Äôt received an update.

Here are some signs he has liked me throughout 3 years of law school:

- He often made an effort to talk to me, ask how I was doing, etc., but I never reciprocated because I was in a relationship.
- He had a dreamy look in his eyes when he talked to me.
- He asked me for coffee the first time we met, but I never followed up.
- He would constantly gaze at me in the few classes we had together, even turning his head in the opposite direction of the professor. (My friends have also noticed this.)
- The only social media we were connected on was LinkedIn, and over the years, he would wish me happy birthday and acknowledge my accomplishments, like when I published my law review article.

Recently, I finally engaged in more conversation with him on LinkedIn after he wished me a happy birthday in September. He was always nice, and I enjoyed the attention, so I asked to connect on Instagram where I‚Äôm more active. He said he didn‚Äôt have social media but gave me his number. I took my time responding. We usually exchange messages a week later, however, he texted me the same day I gave him my number!

We‚Äôve been texting for about 3 weeks, sharing our upbringings, music, and hobbies. He‚Äôs given me compliments that a typical guy wouldn‚Äôt, like my fashion sense and having great skin. I met him for coffee last week, the first time I had seen him since law school.

The problem is, if he says anything borderline flirty, I avoid flirting back. It‚Äôs been very tame, but recently it went up a notch. We were joking around, and he asked if he was attractive. I admitted he was. Then he sent me a picture of himself, calling it an ‚Äúembarrassing photo.‚Äù I felt like we were going too far, so all I said was his photo wasn‚Äôt embarrassing. I didn‚Äôt give him any compliments or send him any photos of me. He even told me I looked like a ‚Äúgoddamn model‚Äù in my iPhone display picture, but I just brushed it off.

Now, his texting has become less frequent and short, but he claims to be busy and unable to respond. He was stressed this week due to the election and bar results, so he warned me he was going to avoid his phone as he processed everything. I understand, but I can‚Äôt help but wonder if he‚Äôs backing off because he thinks I rejected him. Also, we‚Äôre both a bit older so I don‚Äôt think he wants to waste his time.

I want to be honest and tell him I have a crush on him, but we‚Äôre both single and I‚Äôve been trying to avoid going too far. I prefer to do this in person to convey my sincerity and get his honest reaction.

Question: Should I tell him the truth?

for the record, i am not a big fan of YSL BO. i think there's a time and place for it but it's just a very strong scent (for me) so i can't justify buying a whole bottle when i think it's something i'll seldom wear. YSL BO is also a hit or miss type of perfume with most of my family members finding it too nauseating. on the other hand, i do have a few friends who think it's the perfect club perfume -- time and place talaga. immediately i am punched in the face by YSL BO; it's a beautiful scent and i think that combo of coffee / vanilla is something that other brands can't fully replicate because i also catch a whiff of mint (?) that i haven't been able to get from dupes. still, if i was stuck in EDSA traffic with someone wearing a good amount of YSL BO i would probably start walking to my destination before i got a migraine. 

Midnight Blossom got it about 80% right. i find that the initial spray of Midnight Blossom smells identical to the dry down of YSL, but the dry down of Midnight Blossom smells pretty different. i can't fully describe *how* but it's muskier and slightly masculine compared to YSL. i don't get the coffee/vanilla combo but to be fair, Midnight Blossom never claimed to have coffee notes. YSL is ""brighter"" while Midnight Blossom is cozier. It's a lot more intimate and much more suitable for casual dinners / evenings and doesn't command attention the way Black Opium does.

It lasts long for an EDT, at least 5 hours on my skin and a lot longer on my clothes. my family has the same reaction to it: they hate it and they hate me for always wearing it. in my defense, they'd hate me more if i got YSL. overall, i think it's a pretty good dupe if you want something less in-your-face than the original for a fraction of the price. 

i also tried Zara Gardenia which i found is *a lot* closer to Black Opium but i really love the musk of Midnight Blossom so i'm happy with it. BBW Into the Night is also a decent alternative but it's very sweet (and also does not last at all on my skin.) I still prefer Zara dupes over M&S dupes but i do recommend checking M&S out too. I think Zara tries to fully replicate the originals while M&S adds their own twist to it (*inspired* eme) :)",1,1731172474.0,fragheadph,0,1.0,False

Nick and I had to isolate ourselves. Not only because we had to stay up for 72 hours straight, but because we were scared we might spread what we had to others. Neither of us knew what this SORE thing might do to us, but if 72 hours of being awake was what was necessary to keep us and others from getting sick, we were gonna do it.

Luckily, the weekend was just around the corner. A couple of us had Memorial Day off. Nick managed to get a hold of Reggie, who could cover his shift in return for Nick taking a shift on Independence Day. Fair deal. So with a three-day weekend, we had our work cut out for us.

Caffeine was a given, but Nick also had to get some heavier stuff. The kinda thing that gets your heart racing to levesl it shouldn‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not gonna go into detail, but we needed a serious push to get past those last few hours. Remember; both of us had already been up for a full day when we first got exposed to this thing, so we were looking at almost four whole days, and no preparation.

¬†

We made the best of it. We played games, we ate takeout, we set new records on Nick‚Äôs old Guitar Hero games that he dug out of storage. The plastic guitars were a bit stiff and sun-yellowed, but they worked just fine most of the time. The green button would get a bit stuck though.

We went for walks, we took turns taking cold showers, we had a spontaneous karaoke thing going on in the living room‚Ä¶ anything we could to keep the ball rolling and our eyes open. Sometimes I‚Äôd almost fall asleep standing up. Just leaning against a wall was bad enough. My knees would lock into place, and my body would slump a little. That‚Äôs when Nick would shake me back to life.

I had to get him a couple of times too. He once laid down face first on the couch, and I immediately flipped it over; almost wrecking his coffee table as he came tumbling down. It was stupid, but we had to be stupid to make it through this.

¬†

We‚Äôd been up for over 40 hours, and neither of us were making sense. We were out for a walk, hearing the frogs croak in the distance. The sun had just set, but we could still see the light peeking over the horizon. We tried to keep a good pace, but we could both feel it; we were slowing down. I had to keep us focused on something, so I brought up the first thing that came to mind.

‚ÄúYour wife left you for a Salt Lake City stripper?‚Äù

‚ÄúYup,‚Äù Nick nodded. ‚ÄúHad the biceps and the stomach thing and all of it.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey still together?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat? No,‚Äù he laughed. ‚ÄúThey were never together. But she tried, you know.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following.‚Äù

‚ÄúShe went for the guy. She called me up, said it was over, and went for the guy in this big, romantic hullabaloo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd he blew her off?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe was gay,‚Äù Nick shrugged. ‚ÄúSo it wasn‚Äôt really like that.‚Äù

¬†

Nick looked up, as if counting the stars. He sighed. The bags under his eyes looked darker than usual.

‚ÄúI guess when you‚Äôve seen the greener grass, everything else starts to look gross, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou ain‚Äôt gross, Nick. You‚Äôre just another kind of grass. Sorta‚Ä¶ bluegrass, you know?‚Äù

‚ÄúBluegrass,‚Äù he chuckled. ‚ÄúI like that. Bluegrass kinda guy.‚Äù

¬†

Those last few hours, we ended up watching re-runs if Family Matters and chugging Four Loko. I had the Swedish Fish flavor. Nick knew a guy with boxes of the stuff. It was vile, but we had to get over those last few hours. Nick was pacing back and forth but was tired enough to almost fall over.

‚ÄúDone,‚Äù Nick slurred. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm done. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs two hours.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can do two hours,‚Äù I assured him. ‚ÄúYou can do it.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna go stick my head in the freezer.‚Äù

He did just as he said and stuck his head in the freezer. I was trying to keep up with the Winslows and their goofy adventures, but it was hard to pay attention. I had to fill in the blanks a lot, and it didn‚Äôt make a lot of sense. I barely registered the strange colors on-screen as Steve Urkel.

‚ÄúYou know what we can do?‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúWe can‚Ä¶ we can prep.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe can ‚Ä¶ make it comfortable. I‚Äôm gonna make my bed with all new stuff, you can crash out here. And we get like‚Ä¶ tea. And‚Ä¶ ice water, for when we wake up. And I get, like‚Ä¶ scented candles. And we put on whale song, and-‚Äú

‚ÄúAnd we sleep like goddamn‚Ä¶ royalty,‚Äù I added. ‚ÄúRight?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù he nodded, getting more enthusiastic. ‚ÄúYeah, that!‚Äù

¬†

So we got to work. Nick prepped his bed, and I went to his car to get a couple of extra blankets for the couch. Problem was, those were really soft blankets, and there was something about the back seat of his car that calmed me. Maybe the smell and feel of the synthetic leather. So I crawled in the back seat. There was a cold wind blowing, so I closed the door. And in that silence, I figured‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs one hour? It‚Äôd just be an hour. Would that really be so bad?

And so, I crashed in the back seat of his car.

¬†

I was out for 14 hours. Nick got about 12. I woke up with a massive headache, but the ice water that Nick had prepped helped a little. I‚Äôd made us a couple of sandwiches. I thanked the past-us for thinking ahead, as the two of us prepped for work. By all metrics, we ought to have been fine. 72 hours had passed. Nick drove me to work ‚Äì my car was still back at my place.

The conversation dulled as I chugged a full bottle of ice water, pouring the last few drops on my face. Nick looked like he‚Äôd been trampled by some kind of depressed parade. Even his hair looked tired.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre not doing that again, ‚Äú I said.

‚ÄúNo, we‚Äôre not,‚Äù Nick agreed. ‚ÄúSo we‚Äôre‚Ä¶ we‚Äôre dropping this.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt answer. I had pulled Nick into some bad shit one time too many. And yeah, the ends justify the means. I was looking for this lost girl, and I‚Äôd stumbled upon the very thing that got her lost in the first place. Nick looked over at me and sighed. He took a moment to choose his words.

‚ÄúI get it,‚Äù he finally said. ‚ÄúYou wanted to help. You still do. But let‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs think about it. Let‚Äôs be careful.‚Äù

‚ÄúIf you want me to back off, you gotta promise me something, Nick.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes, then looked at me. I wasn‚Äôt joking, and he could tell. With a sigh, he nodded.

‚ÄúYou gotta promise me that if you pick up any lead, whatsoever, on Adam‚Äôs missing girl ‚Äì you‚Äôre telling me. You can call the shots, but there‚Äôs gotta be shots to call. I‚Äôm not the only one here to serve and protect, right?‚Äù

Nick tasted the words, throwing a glance in the rear-view mirror.

‚ÄúAlright,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúDeal.‚Äù

¬†

It took us a full work week to get back on our feet. My sleep schedule was a joke. One night I‚Äôd be in bed by six, another night I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all. I‚Äôd zone out at work, missing a word every now and then, much like I‚Äôd missed the story beats on Family Matters. I‚Äôd lag behind a bit, trying to piece together the context and make it make sense.

As I slowly got my routine back in order, May rolled into June. We started getting some proper heat. People were talking about a dry season, with no hint of rain for a long time to come. They weren‚Äôt wrong; there wouldn‚Äôt be a drop of water for two and a half weeks.

Midway through June, I was back on patrol duty. Charlie and Reggie were back to covering dispatch. Nick and I were on the same team, courtesy of a thankfully short conversation with sheriff Mason. I got the impression that the DUC were backing off ‚Äì like some kind of situation had sort of resolved itself, seemingly.

¬†

I was on my way home from a particularly rough shift. A couple of tourists had tried to shoplift from the local grocery store. After resisting arrest and racking up two counts of obstruction, they managed to fail themselves all the way into a felony charge. Hysterical people were part of the job, but they were a shitty part of the job. But yeah, Tomskog doesn‚Äôt have a lot of those. It was nice to have something regular to do, for once.

Coming home from that shift, I felt like things were getting back to normal. The first drops of rain spattered against the hood of my car as I pulled into the driveway of my house. The moment I stepped outside, it felt like bliss.

The water was cooling. Reassuring, in a way. Like Mother Earth was whispering to me that things were gonna be okay. I just stopped for a second, put down my groceries, and basked in it. I found myself with my arms outstretched, and my mouth wide open ‚Äì just drinking it all in.

I stood there for 35 minutes.

¬†

I‚Äôm not gonna lie, that was worrisome. Up until that point, I‚Äôd been fine. Could that one hour of SORE linger in your system that long? Could that be what caused it?

I tried to rationalize it, thinking I was overreacting. But in Tomskog, there‚Äôs no such thing as overreacting. If anything, people tended to shove life-threatening bullshit under the rug way too fast; myself included. So just to make sure, I gave Nick a call, explaining what I‚Äôd done.

‚ÄúYeah, that‚Äôs a symptom,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut I think some folks would just sort of stop at that, especially at the ass-end of things.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo it could mean that‚Äôs the last of it?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúLike it‚Äôs out of my system?‚Äù

‚ÄúSure, yeah. It could. It‚Äôs like when you get a bad cold. You get a runny nose, you get a headache, but that‚Äôs just your body fighting it off. This is sort of like that.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what do I do?‚Äù

‚ÄúKeep an eye on it. And if it gets worse, we do something.‚Äù

‚ÄúDo what?‚Äù

Nick was quiet. I looked back at my still-packed groceries, pacing restlessly.

‚ÄúDo what, Nick?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomething. I dunno.‚Äù

¬†

There were a couple of signs that things weren‚Äôt okay, but they were harder to spot than you might imagine. It is only later, when I looked back on this time, that I realized these weren‚Äôt really normal things.

For example, automatic doors stopped working. They‚Äôd close on me seemingly at random, as if they didn‚Äôt register that I was really there. It got annoying after a while, and I even got my foot stuck at one point.

Another thing was the water. No matter how hot I set the water to, it would end up going cold after a couple of seconds. I had to start taking really short showers. I called a plumber on two separate occasions, and both times they assured me that nothing was wrong.

Then there were the birds. There were just a handful of them, but I‚Äôd start to spot these bright red birds circling outside. They‚Äôd flee and scatter at the sight of me, but I‚Äôd never seen them before. They weren‚Äôt native to the area.

In and of themselves, these events would just be weird happenstances, but in the context of being exposed to something I didn‚Äôt understand ‚Äì they had to be connected.

¬†

Then there was that one morning. I got to work, used the bathroom, and as I washed my hands I looked up to see my reflection. As I did, I watched it turn to ash.

The skin looked like it sagged off my face and evaporated into dust, leaving a blackened charcoal-like skull behind. Empty sockets leaving a dead, empty stare. I tried to blink it away, but the image wouldn‚Äôt disappear. I would turn my head, and as I did, the reflection would do the same; until decay caused the skull to detach and roll off the shoulder.

As it did, the light flickered. There was a sound. I expected a thud, but it was something darker, more rumbling. Like a drawn out‚Ä¶

***‚Äò H E L L O ‚Äò***

¬†

I ran out, grabbed Nick by the arm, and got out of the station. I got a lot of weird looks that day, but I‚Äôd started to get a bit of a reputation as a wild card anyway. At least I wasn‚Äôt just a rookie. Nick pulled himself free, looking me up and down. It took him a couple of seconds to soften his expression.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting worse?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúA lot.‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, the only one I can think of that would know something about this is Digman, and that fucker‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt we have guys on surveillance?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe‚Äôs been gone for weeks. Suspected dead.‚Äù

‚ÄúDead?!‚Äù a scoffed. ‚ÄúHow are we not talking about this?!‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not been confirmed or anything,‚Äù Nick shrugged. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no body.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo what the hell do we do then?!‚Äù

Nick paced a little, adjusting his pink sunglasses. Looking back at the station, I could see we had a bit of an audience.

‚ÄúWe could get the DUC,‚Äù I suggested. ‚ÄúThey study this, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôd go away,‚Äù Nick said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúPermanently.‚Äù

¬†

Nick looked around, as if expecting to see an answer in our immediate vicinity. Either that, or he was having trouble keeping eye contact.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Nick said. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs this one thing that‚Äôs sort of a cure-all kinda deal, but it‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs dumb. Real dumb. Like, actual dumb.‚Äù

‚ÄúNick, I gotta‚Ä¶ what are you suggesting?‚Äù

‚ÄúLook, if you can hold on, and I‚Äôm not suggesting anything else, you could, technically-‚Äú

‚ÄúFor fuck‚Äôs sake Nick, spit it out.‚Äù

He rolled his eyes, and he threw out his arms in surrender.

‚ÄúYou could do a Yearwalk. Same thing as Digman. You would have to make it ‚Äòtil New Years, and then a *whole other year*, but I‚Äôve seen it done. It‚Äôs an absolutely insane thing, but it can do anything.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhen you say anything, what *exactly* do you mean?‚Äù

¬†

Nick lowered his glasses and his voice.

‚ÄúIt can literally bring the dead back to life. I‚Äôd bet my life that it could wipe away whatever shit you got in your system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ chopping off your neck ‚Äòcause you got a headache.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm just sayin‚Äô,‚Äù Nick clarified. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs always a backup plan.‚Äù

¬†

Things would escalate from there. The next time it rained, just a couple of days later, I lost one and half hours. I stepped outside and blacked out, waking up with a mouthful of rainwater.

I started having nightmares. I‚Äôd have no idea what about, I‚Äôd just wake up with a cold sweat and a heart pounding panic. I knew it was bad, but I didn‚Äôt know why. Sometimes, there‚Äôd be bruises.

And this one time, I woke up with an awful stomach cramp.¬† I rushed to the bathroom, thinking I had indigestion, when I tripped on the threshold. I landed stomach-first on the bathroom tiles, and there was this fullness in my throat that just spurted out. I coughed up about half a dozen thin white strings.

¬†

It was just the end of them; they were still attached to me. I could feel them moving in my throat. I tried pulling them out, but the cramp sent this shockwave of pain through me; like the strands had roots in my gut. It felt like pulling them out might kill me.

I got up off the floor and grabbed some nail clippers. Taking a single strand, I clipped it off. I got this intense pain in my chest, like my heart didn‚Äôt know what to do. It felt like I‚Äôd been stabbed, or lost a tooth. There was this sharp, cutting pain, curling all the way from my throat down to the base of my spine. I just stood there, having these white strands hanging from the edge of my lips; like I‚Äôd swallowed a cheap wig.

There was only one option. I leaned my head back and slowly, but surely, swallowed. I spent the better part of an hour on that bathroom floor, clutching my stomach. I thought about getting in the shower, but it‚Äôd just be too cold. A single dead strand of white lay in the sink, stinking of chlorine and ammonia. It was so acidic that it discolored the ceramic with a tinge of blue.

¬†

Later that night, I spent time going through Adam‚Äôs notes. The man had been researching SORE for some time, and although his notes made little sense, I figured there might be something in there that I‚Äôd missed.

Flipping page, after page, after page, I lulled myself into this semi-hypnotic state. Hand-written notes took ages to read. The notes were mostly focused on what he thought his daughter Elizabeth had been exposed to, but he was making an attempt to piece together info about the condition itself as well.

And that was the scariest thing; it was never a disease, or an infection. It was a *condition*. Every page all but confirmed that SORE didn‚Äôt destroy or introduce anything to the body. It escalated something we already contained. It meant that whatever effect SORE was triggering had a universal component *already present* in every single human. And, according to Adam‚Äôs notes, a handful of other creatures. Lions, most notably, and certain kinds of fish.

¬†

Falling asleep over the notebooks, I barely even read anymore. I just saw the pages flip. But there was something off. I was holding my head up with my left hand and checking my phone with my right.

So how was I turning the page?

¬†

Something cold retracted down my throat. It felt like swallowing a sort of tasteless, gelatinous yoghurt. Soft, boneless, and chunky.

I fell out of my seat, tapping my body. My chest, my stomach, my head. I was okay. I wasn‚Äôt even nauseous. But my heart was racing like a steam engine, and I could feel a strange weight in the pit of my stomach. Like I was full, but without eating. Something was pressing against my organs; albeit ever so gently.

¬†

I picked up the phone and called Nick. I ran into my bathroom, looking at myself in the mirror. I looked normal. I was okay.

‚Äú‚Ä¶yeah?‚Äù Nick answered.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs worse,‚Äù I huffed. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs so much worse.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can be there in‚Ä¶ fifteen.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you gonna tell me what‚Äôs-‚Äú

¬†

I made this ungodly noise, like I was bracing for a sneeze. But instead of a sneeze, I felt something rooted in my stomach shoot itself out of my throat. A white tentacle-like appendage slapped my phone out of my hands, sending it across the room.

The reflection in the mirror was still standing as I fell to the floor. It was turning to ash, and reaching its hands towards the appendage; almost like a greeting, or an invitation. The two reached towards one another. I grasped the thing coming out of my throat, but it was slippery. It felt like trying to strangle a soap.

I couldn‚Äôt think straight. What was I even fighting? What was happening to me?

¬†

Rushing towards the door, I caught a final glimpse of that reflection. It wasn‚Äôt just a decaying me reaching out; there was something behind it. Something impossibly dark, guiding its arm. Like a tutor teaching a pupil. It reminded me of how my mom had stood behind me at the shooting range when I was a teenager. A memory that, up until that point, had been nothing but positive.

Crashing through the door, I stumbled through the living room, dragging the exposed white appendage behind me like an unfriendly dog on a leash. I tried leaning my head back and swallowing, forcing it back down my throat, but I just ended up gagging on air. It was straining itself, testing the roots in the pit of my stomach. It struggled, knocking over a couple of chairs as it twitched and slithered back and forth on the floor.

I leaned back against the wall, bracing myself to pull. It was gonna hurt like hell, but I had no choice.

Then, I accidentally hit the light switch.

¬†

All of a sudden, it retracted. It rolled back down my throat like a measuring tape, snapping hard enough that it tapped the tip of my noise going down. Kinda like the spaghetti scene in Lady and the Tramp; another memory forever spoiled by that nightmarish thing.

I waited by the door, in the light. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I was getting worse by the day, and there was no doubt in my mind that it was a SORE thing anymore. There‚Äôd been illustrations in Adam‚Äôs notebooks. Descriptions. Hell, I‚Äôd seen the thing burst out of him that night in May; just before Nick and I killed him and set fire to his remains.

I was screwed. There was no other way to say it. Going to the DUC would put everyone under investigation, and I‚Äôd be gone. Staying with Nick could mean infecting others.

¬†

When Nick pulled up, I walked out the door and held up a hand. I had no idea what I was gonna do or say, but I couldn‚Äôt put him in danger again. SORE could spread at minimum contact, and there was no way I could control it. I had no idea if a sneeze or light touch could infect him. I had to keep my distance.

‚ÄúYou okay?‚Äù he asked, stepping out of the car.

‚ÄúYou, uh‚Ä¶ you got anything?‚Äù I asked. ‚ÄúAny solutions?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot yet,‚Äù he admitted. ‚ÄúBut I think our best bet is to go hunting for Digman. They say he‚Äôs gone, but‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs a slippery shit. I don‚Äôt think he could die if he wanted to.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah,‚Äù I nodded. ‚ÄúSounds good.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou, uh‚Ä¶ you don‚Äôt look okay,‚Äù Nick blurted out. ‚ÄúI mean, you got that heroine chic thing going on, but it‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ more heroin than chic.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be good, Nick.‚Äù

¬†

There was something about my tone made him quiet down. We looked at one another in silence, considering the weight of our words.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs real bad, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúUh-huh,‚Äù I nodded.

I looked down. Usually, Nick could fix things. He could help me, or I could help him. But this time, my partner was as helpless as I was.

‚ÄúI think you should go, Nick,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúYou can get sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúFuck that.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm serious, Nick.‚Äù

He looked at me with his arms crossed. I hadn‚Äôt even noticed how he hadn‚Äôt brought his trademark pink sunglasses.

‚ÄúWhat are you gonna do?‚Äù he asked.

‚ÄúI dunno,‚Äù I shrugged. ‚ÄúBut you gotta go. I can‚Äôt‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt control it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you asking or telling me?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm asking.‚Äù

¬†

He bit his lip, putting his hands at his sides. He wanted to say something else, but he couldn‚Äôt. He just gave me this look, like he was asking me to reconsider. I just shook my head at him.

He reluctantly got back in his car. And to his credit, he did as I asked. He left.

I packed some things. Mostly notebooks, some clothes, and cash. I locked the place up, got in my car, and drove. I couldn‚Äôt stick around where I might hurt someone. At the end of the day, it was still about protect and serve.

¬†

I tried not to look in the rear-view mirror, or the side mirrors. It felt like something was off, like they weren‚Äôt really showing me what they should. There was that feeling that a tiny tilt would show me something I didn‚Äôt want to see.

I‚Äôd have to blink away things that weren‚Äôt there. I‚Äôd see shapes lining the side of the road. I‚Äôd feel something in my stomach twist and turn, as if commanded by something to act. I bit down hard, making sure my teeth touched, and put a hand in front of my mouth.

But it didn‚Äôt help for long. Something tickled my nose instead.

¬†

I remember thinking ‚Äòno‚Äô. That‚Äôs all I was thinking. Streetlights were passing me by as I sped up. As I got further out of town, the streetlights made way for worse and worse dirt roads, leading me into spaces the Tomskog folks rarely went. I didn‚Äôt really think about it. If that ‚Äòs what it was gonna be, that‚Äôs what it was gonna be.

I‚Äôd see humanoid shapes on the sides. Darkened, charcoal-like things, like the decay I‚Äôd seen looking back at me in the mirror. I could taste the sourness in my mouth as something struggled to be freed, and I could see things moving in the mirrors at the edge of my peripheral. I was doing something *it* didn‚Äôt want, and it was gonna let me know. It wanted to be around people. It wanted to meet others. Fuck that.

My car shook. Even with a seat belt, I smacked my head against the roof of the car as I hit a rock. I almost lost my steering. I had to pull the hand brake, coming to a full stop.

¬†

As my body shot forward, the car screeched to a halt. The second my body thumped against the seat belt, little white strands shot out of my whole face. A tickle in my eyes and nose. Something between my teeth. Something running out of my ears like a bad ear wax. The strands were almost two feet long now, scattered across the dashboard, moving independently of one another.

Chlorine and ammonia. The smell was overwhelming, and for a moment, I just sat there. I was afraid to move, thinking I was a sudden jerk away from excruciating pain. I slowly pulled my head back and turned the car off. I just sat there with my face feeling like a leaking lemon. Was this the end stage? Was I about to lose my mind, like Adam had?

I looked up to see my reflection in the rear-view mirror. It hurt when I blinked. Little strands of white were moving my eyelashes, forcing me to blink over and over. I was expecting to see some horrific vision, but all I saw was myself.

That was bad enough.

¬†

Looking out into the dark, I could see silhouettes. Things as dark as decay, moving closer. An army, asking me to join. Something horrible, and primal, bringing out the worst in me; making it spill out like an overflowing bowl.

I got out of the car and brought my flashlight. If light messed with these things, I‚Äôd mess with them all the way to my grave. I kept going down the broken dirt road by foot, desperate to get as far away as possible. I saw an old sign saying ‚ÄòSt. Gall‚Äô, but I had no reference to what that might mean. There was no place on the map with that name. Maybe I was just distracted. I think I‚Äôd heard it mentioned a couple of times.

My light would land on things. Things peeking out behind trees. Things moving in the grass. Distant whispers. Interested parties taking note.

¬†

A drop of blood ran from my nose. I was having trouble concentrating. I couldn‚Äôt remember the name of the Winslows anymore. Did I even like Family Matters? Was that even a TV-show?

I fell to my knees. I couldn‚Äôt keep up with thinking and moving at once, so I settled for thinking. I sat there on my knees, confounded and confused. I didn‚Äôt even notice me turning the flashlight off; embracing the dark.

¬†

I remember looking up and seeing something massive coming towards me. It didn‚Äôt make a sound. It was just this presence; hollow and immense. When it finally spoke, it was as if spoken from behind a pane of glass. Resonating, vibrating. Trying to break through.

***‚Äò H E L L O ‚Äò***

I waved back, one finger at a time, like I was drumming on an invisible dashboard.

‚ÄúHello,‚Äù I said.‚Äù How‚Ä¶ how are you?‚Äù

¬†

It reached for me, and the things inside me reached back. Like extending for a handshake. Someone welcoming an old friend. A promise of something horrible to come. I was just the broken shell of a snail, waiting to be replaced. White strands raised themselves out of me. Something large adjusted itself, causing me to almost tip over.

I tried pulling back, but there was no point. Not only was I exhausted, but I didn‚Äôt understand what I was fighting against. But I remember laughing out loud. Because, despite knowing I was about to die, that something would be torn from me, a thought crossed my mind.

Carl. *Carl Winslow* was the dad on Family Matters.

And in that moment, I knew that this thing hadn‚Äôt really won. Not yet. I could still think.

¬†

I gathered whatever thoughts I could muster and directed it into a tiny little movement. I twitched my thumb, and the flashlight came back on. I‚Äôd been holding it on the ground, and it lit up my face like I was a kid telling a scary story.

My face burned as it retreated into me, like a rabbit diving for its burrow. I was left with these chemical streaks across my face, and this awful tickle in my throat. But for a brief moment, there was nothing there. It was just a nice summer night, with frogs croaking in the distance, and the stars as bright as ever.

¬†

‚ÄúMiss, are you harmed?‚Äù

I turned around to see someone coming down the road. A nice-looking woman in a blue kaftan.

She got closer, and I wanted to keep my distance; but I physically couldn‚Äôt. I can‚Äôt imagine what I must‚Äôve looked like. And yet, this woman stopped about six feet away and sat down. She didn‚Äôt seem the least bit bothered.

‚ÄúYou‚Ä¶ you should go,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt get‚Ä¶ get sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúI will not get sick,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúSo that is not going to be a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou could‚Ä¶ get sick,‚Äù I mumbled. ‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ it? I could get‚Ä¶ it could kill.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo no no,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúThat will not be an issue.‚Äù

She got up, scooched closer, and sat across from me. I tried to crawl back, but I couldn‚Äôt get my arms to move. SORE was reaching into my brain. I could feel it. I could hear the roots crackling as they physically wrapped around my brain stem. It wouldn‚Äôt let me control myself again.

¬†

‚ÄúDid you come here to get help?‚Äù she asked.

‚ÄúNo, to‚Ä¶ to‚Ä¶ ¬†away. Don‚Äôt‚Ä¶ sick.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally? Even now, that is what you are thinking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äôt‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt get‚Ä¶‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt finish my sentence. My head hung low, as a weight fell on my neck. She put her hand on my chin and lifted me up to look at her.

¬†

‚ÄúLook, sweetie,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI can not tell a lie. So what I am saying is not just comfort, it is what is going to be, understand‚Äù

I tried to nod at her, but I couldn‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThis thing will not kill you,‚Äù she continued. ‚ÄúIt will not control you. You will not infect anyone. I promise, that is not gonna happen. It can not happen.‚Äù

She wiped a tear from my eye with her thumb. My tear was a light blue.

‚ÄúYou will feel better in the morning,‚Äù she smiled. ‚ÄúHere. And try to remember the nice human lady with the kaftan who helped you, yes?‚Äù

She handed me a handkerchief, gave me a kiss on the cheek, and wandered off down the road. I closed my eyes, listening for her footsteps to disappear.

¬†

I must‚Äôve sat there for hours. All night.

At the crack of dawn, I found myself still sitting in the middle of the road, clutching a handkerchief with a little blue sunflower on it. My legs had long since fallen asleep. I was hungry and tired. Dirty as all hell. I could feel something dried on my face, leaving scabs and flakes to be picked off. I closed my eyes, testing myself to see if I was really okay.

I thought about the show Family Matters again. It was a good measuring tape. Carl Winslow was the dad. Harriette was the mom. Laura and Eddie were the kids. Then, I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh.

‚ÄúUrkel,‚Äù I chuckled. ‚ÄúSteve fucking Urkel.‚Äù

It was all there. All the little bits and bobs from the back of my mind. I was really feeling better, like the lady had said I would.

¬†

I don‚Äôt know how she did it, or why. I could still feel something inside, but I was in control. I could keep it down. I could breathe, and there was no pain. Not even a threat of pain.

‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt kill me,‚Äù I muttered. ‚ÄúIt won‚Äôt infect.‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. I believed her. It felt true. I don‚Äôt know how it could be, but it was. I was certain of it.

¬†

I stumbled my way back to my car, closed the door, and put on my seat belt. There were these splashes of blue across the dashboard from where the white strands had touched. I must‚Äôve been hours, maybe minutes away from falling under the influence of that thing, like Adam. But where he‚Äôd lost his mind, I‚Äôd gotten a strange second wind.

Maybe it was like Nick had said, that it was just the ‚Äòsickness‚Äô taking its course. But I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs it. I think what saved me that night was a chance encounter with a woman from St. Gall.

First thing I did was call him. It just took two signals.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm better,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs gonna be okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou fixed it?‚Äù

‚ÄúKinda.‚Äù

‚ÄúHow?‚Äù

‚ÄúThere was a lady, and‚Ä¶‚Äù

I looked down at the handkerchief with the blue sunflower and laughed a little at myself. It was such a stupid moment, but it was so relieving.

‚Äú‚Ä¶ and Steve Urkel, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you fucking *drunk?*‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure as hell gonna be.‚Äù

¬†

I hung up and watched the Minnesota sun come up over the horizon. I‚Äôd made it through the night. There might be more trouble down the road, but for now, I was okay.

But in that moment, I just had to sit for a while. Strange how I can‚Äôt, to this day, picture what that lady really looked like. I know she was a nice lady with a blue kaftan, but there‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ no detail. There‚Äôs nothing really there. It‚Äôs just the words, and what I remember feeling.

But that don‚Äôt make me any less thankful.",4,1731171732.0,nosleep,1,0.83,False

**Comprehensive Dashboard**

One of the standout features of The Money Wave is its comprehensive dashboard. This dashboard offers a bird‚Äôs-eye view of your financial health. You can easily track your spending, income, and savings, all in one place. For many users, having clear visibility into their finances helps them make informed decisions. Instead of feeling lost in a sea of numbers, you can see where your money is coming from and where it‚Äôs going. This clarity can lead to better budgeting and savings strategies.

**Budgeting Tools**

The platform also offers educational resources to help users understand different investment strategies.

**Automated Savings**

* **Savings Goals:**¬†Users can set specific savings goals, like an emergency fund or a dream vacation. The Money Wave will automatically allocate funds toward these goals.
* **Round-Up Feature:**¬†This feature rounds up your purchases to the nearest dollar and saves the difference. For instance, if you buy a coffee for $3.50, it will set aside $0.50. Over time, these small amounts add up, making saving effortless.

Automated savings features have proven to be a game-changer for users. They allow people to save without even thinking about it. Users often find that these small changes lead to significant savings over time, ultimately allowing them to achieve their financial aims faster.

**Personalized Insights**

The Money Wave analyzes your spending habits and provides personalized insights. By understanding your financial behavior, you gain the ability to make better decisions. For example, if the platform suggests cutting back on dining out to boost your savings, users can adjust accordingly. These tailored recommendations cater to individual needs and preferences, helping you navigate your financial journey more effectively.

**Mobile Accessibility**

In today‚Äôs fast-paced world, mobile accessibility is non-negotiable. The Money Wave offers a seamless mobile experience that allows users to manage their finances on the go. Whether you want to check your balance, update your budget, or transfer money, it‚Äôs all at your fingertips. This convenience ensures you never miss a beat with your finances, whether you‚Äôre at home or out and about.

# Comparing The Money Wave with Other Financial Platforms

When it comes to online financial platforms, one that has garnered attention is The Money Wave. It offers unique features that set it apart in an increasingly crowded market. But how does it fare when compared to other financial platforms? Let‚Äôs dive deeper into the unique offerings of The Money Wave and how it stacks up against its competitors.

First, let's talk about usability. The Money Wave presents a user-friendly interface that is designed to help users navigate smoothly. While many platforms overload users with information, The Money Wave simplifies the experience, making it easier for both beginners and experienced investors. For example, users can easily access their portfolios and financial tools without facing a steep learning curve.

In contrast, several other financial platforms, like Robinhood and E\*TRADE, offer robust tools that can become overwhelming. While they provide advanced trading features and analytics, they may not cater to the layperson as effectively. This can lead to confusion and a frustrating user experience for individuals who are new to investing.

The Money Wave also emphasizes education. Their platform provides a variety of resources that help users understand market trends, investment strategies, and financial literacy. This educational angle is pivotal, especially for those who are just starting their investing journey. Other platforms have similar resources, but they often require extra fees or are buried within complex menus.

Now, let‚Äôs evaluate the fee structures. The Money Wave operates on a low-cost model, which is attractive to cost-conscious investors. Many users appreciate that commissions on trades are minimal, allowing them to retain more of their profits. Other platforms like Webull and TD Ameritrade also pride themselves on no-commission trades. However, they might charge for other services or have higher fees for advanced features, which could squeeze the budget of new investors.

Risk management also differs significantly among financial platforms. The Money Wave promotes various risk assessment tools to help users determine their risk appetite before investing. This proactive approach aids in making informed decisions, thus potentially leading to more favorable investment outcomes. While platforms like Fidelity offer similar tools, they are often technical and might be difficult to understand for the average user.

Another significant aspect to consider is customer support. The Money Wave has built a reputation for responsive customer service. Users can reach out through various channels, including chat, email, and phone support. This accessibility can ease the minds of users who may have urgent queries or concerns while navigating their investments. In comparison, some platforms like Charles Schwab and Ally Invest may have longer wait times or more complicated customer service processes, possibly leading users to feel frustrated when they need help.

Speaking of community, The Money Wave fosters an active community of users. This engagement creates a platform for sharing experiences and tips, which can be invaluable for new investors. Connecting with others who are on a similar financial journey often leads to increased confidence and better decision-making. While other platforms may have forums or social features, they aren't always as integrated or user-friendly as what The Money Wave offers.

Here‚Äôs a quick comparison of features between The Money Wave and some leading platforms:

* **Usability:**¬†Simple and intuitive interface (The Money Wave) vs. Complex layout (E\*TRADE)
* **Education:**¬†Extensive resources and guides (The Money Wave) vs. Limited access unless paid (Robinhood)
* **Fee Structure:**¬†Low-cost models (The Money Wave) vs. Potential additional costs (TD Ameritrade)
* **Risk Management:**¬†User-friendly assessment tools (The Money Wave) vs. Technical tools (Fidelity)
* **Customer Support:**¬†Quick response times (The Money Wave) vs. Longer wait times (Charles Schwab)
* **Community Engagement:**¬†Active user interactions (The Money Wave) vs. Less integrated forums (Ally Invest)

Ultimately, The Money Wave stands out by combining user-friendly features with educational resources, robust customer support, and minimal costs. While platforms like Robinhood and Fidelity provide their own advantages, they may not offer the comprehensive environment that The Money Wave does for all types of investors. It is crucial to evaluate what matters most to you in a financial platform. Whether it‚Äôs ease of use, low fees, or educational support, The Money Wave has positioned itself as a worthy contender in the financial tech landscape.

# Success Stories: Users Who Found Wealth with The Money Wave

Many individuals dream of financial freedom, and some have turned their dreams into reality through ‚ÄúThe Money Wave.‚Äù This program has not only caught the attention of aspiring wealth creators but has also produced tangible success stories from users who have found wealth using it. Let's dive into these inspiring testimonies, showcasing how the program has made a significant difference in the lives of those who took the plunge.

Users of The Money Wave have reported varied experiences that highlight the program's potential to transform financial situations. A common theme among many success stories is the straightforward approach of the platform. It provides users with the knowledge and tools necessary to navigate complex financial waters. The personal anecdotes shared by its users often underline a few consistent aspects:

* **Access to Knowledge:**¬†Many users credit their success to the extensive educational resources offered. The program covers diverse topics, from investing strategies to money management tactics.
* **Community Support:**¬†The collaborative environment encourages users to share insights and experiences, creating a network of support that often leads to accelerated learning.
* **Practical Application:**¬†Users appreciate that the program emphasizes real-world applications, enabling them to put their learning into practice immediately.

Take Jane, for example. A single mother working multiple jobs, Jane felt overwhelmed and unable to save money. After joining The Money Wave, she learned about smart saving techniques that she could easily incorporate into her daily routine. Within a year, Jane not only began saving but also started investing small amounts. Her story is a testament to the power of the right knowledge and its impact on one‚Äôs financial journey.

Similarly, Mark, a recent college graduate, faced crippling student debt. Like many new graduates, he felt lost when it came to budgeting. When he discovered The Money Wave, he took the ‚ÄúDebt Elimination‚Äù course offered by the program. He learned how to tackle debt strategically while still saving for the future. Today's Mark is debt-free and currently building his investment portfolio. His success showcases that with determination and the right guidance, financial hurdles can be overcome.

Not only individual users share their stories; several small businesses have also benefited from The Money Wave. For instance, a local caf√© owner named Sarah utilized the financial planning resources to stabilize her business finances during challenging times. By applying the budgeting and investment strategies from the program, Sarah not only kept her caf√© afloat but also expanded her offerings. Her story illustrates how The Money Wave extends beyond personal finance to positively influence business growth.

Another noteworthy instance is David, who was skeptical at first. He had tried multiple money-making schemes before, but none yielded the results he wanted. However, after giving The Money Wave a shot, he discovered the power of systematic investing. He consistently followed the recommended strategies, and within a few years, he accumulated substantial wealth. David‚Äôs transformation from skepticism to success highlights how crucial it is to stay open-minded and dedicated to learning.

Users often emphasize one vital aspect: the ability to personalize their financial journeys. The Money Wave encourages users to tailor the strategies to fit their unique circumstances. This flexibility allows for a diverse range of success stories. Each user‚Äôs path to wealth may differ, but the foundational knowledge gained from The Money Wave remains a constant.

In addition to user experiences, testimonials and reviews continually highlight the confidence built through education. Users report feeling empowered to make informed financial decisions for themselves and their families. This newfound knowledge is like a lighthouse guiding them through turbulent waters.

The community aspect cannot be overlooked, as many users have formed lasting relationships through the program. They share tips and celebrate each other's victories, fostering a culture of motivation and success. Many users find camaraderie that helps sustain their financial journeys, revealing an emotional investment in their peers‚Äô successes.

The success stories from The Money Wave emphasize a common thread: the program equips users with practical knowledge and strategies that lead to meaningful financial change. From individual transformations to business successes, it proves that wealth creation is possible with determination and the right resources. You too can tap into such stories, and perhaps, your own success may be the next celebrated tale within this thriving community.

New customers will **also receive 5 free ‚Äúbeans‚Äù** (Costa Loyalty scheme) following your first purchase. This is in addition to the 1 point awarded for downloading the app. You collect 1 bean for every purchased drink (2 beans if you bring a reusable cup). Once you have accumulated 10 beans you can claim a free drink.

* **Download the Costa app**. Direct from your App Store or find a link ([here](https://www.costa.co.uk/costa-club#app-promo)).

Pro tip, if it‚Äôs anything like Caff√® Nero then you only get 1 free bean per drinks order maximum (2 if using a reusable cup). So if buying coffee for you and a friend ask to pay in 2 transactions and so scanning your app twice. Thus getting you 2 beans (or 4 if using reusable cups).

I'm 25, and I have an 8-month-old baby girl. A bit of background: I‚Äôm currently a stay-at-home mom because about two years ago I had a 10cm non-cancerous pancreatic tumor removed. When I got pregnant, my husband and I decided I‚Äôd stay home to care for our baby, but now I feel like I‚Äôm at a breaking point and considering leaving him. I don't know what to do anymore.

My husband quit his job about a year ago, and he still hasn‚Äôt found another one. Even when I've paid to get a resume done for him. He does Uber occasionally, but that‚Äôs not enough to cover our bills. The worst part came the day before I gave birth when I found out he hadn‚Äôt paid the mortgage for two months. We own the house with my brother, so now our credit is wrecked. He didn‚Äôt tell anyone because he was scared to, and this seems to be a pattern where he avoids dealing with problems until they‚Äôre impossible to ignore.

I feel like I‚Äôm carrying everything on my shoulders. I wake him up every day ‚Äì it takes an hour to get him out of bed. He doesn‚Äôt help with cooking, cleaning, or even showering unless I explicitly tell him what to do. But he always does what i tell him. He stays up until 2 a.m. playing video games. I love gaming, too, but it‚Äôs too much, and it‚Äôs become an escape for him, I think. 

I was in a car crash before i met him and He had promised that when I got my settlement money (56k), he would get a certificate in IT, and we would pay the bills with that money, and start a career. Instead, he never studied and just played games, and now the money is gone. That money we had known was for my teeth because they are falling part. Pain and falling out from the crash and all the medical stuff I went through. And now I can't do anything to fix them.

Another major issue is his parents took $1,500 from us after I gave them $4,000 to help them out. My mom has been financially supporting us while we live with her, paying for anything we're short on, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like I‚Äôm drowning here. He is a good person at heart, and he loves our daughter, but he is so passive and avoids responsibility at all costs. He‚Äôs never raised his voice or argued with me, and he's always calm. But I can‚Äôt keep asking him to do things, and nothing changes.
He says he hates himself for all the stuff that's happened but he's not changing anything. 

We‚Äôve talked about his depression before, and i try to help with the emotional load while he‚Äôs stuck in a state of inaction. He‚Äôs trying to get into the Air Force and scored well on his test, so I‚Äôm hopeful that might help, but I can‚Äôt keep living like this in the meantime.

Our mornings are basically me waking up with the baby at 7 am, trying to get him out of bed by 9, but he wakes up at 10 then im making him food and coffee, and hoping he helps with her for a bit. Then, he either naps or might go do Uber for a few hours. But it's been like this for months, and I feel so stuck.

He never has any sex drive and honestly after trying and trying to just have some sort of intimate relationship with him I've given up and don't even find him attractive really...

He's so kind. And so soft. And would never abuse me. I grew up with horrible men.

I don‚Äôt want to leave him, but I‚Äôm scared of my future. I can‚Äôt keep living like this, and I don't know if I should keep trying to help him or if it's time to walk away. Anyone been in a similar situation or have any advice on what to do next?",2,1731170147.0,Marriage,2,1.0,False

I am a certified tech wizard and can work as personal tech support, I get paid in companionship. I dont want kids and or drama in general, no anger issues here and am an avid meme and random internet bullshit lover. Music makes my brain tingle in the best ways and no matter how bad of a movie I watch, if its with someone special to me that movie is the best thing ever.

Am artistic as hell, used for brainstorming and showing concepts to cause I apparently give good ideas. I do random projects for friends cause why not so if you want to see an ad for a coffee shop in unreal engine just ask.

I am pretty sure lord of the rings woke up whatever creativity I had in me and I will never forget being that kid in a corner trying to be as quiet as possible while watching the movie.

Playing a game together is always an option, I am good at just about anything I touch and will never be toxic to you. I laugh a lot and will most likely try to make you laugh too and prefer voice calls more than texting. Movies and shows are always an option no matter how weird it is (looking at you ""serbian film"" you bastard).

I probably missed a bunch of things about me but thats the fun part of talking to someone right? :D So come and make one of the best decisions ever.

Just as we need to protect our emails, freelancers must safeguard their digital kingdoms against cyber intruders. Stay vigilant, folks!

Well my psychiatrist just started me on 10 mg Adderall which I've been taking for about 4 days and I have noticed it makes me tired. Lots less energy, and less motivation.

I have noticed the same will happen with caffeine which I've known for years. I expect the first half to 1 cup to make me more tired before the balance turns and I start actually getting any energy back. For the record I often won't drink caffeine for weeks or months and the effects don't seem to change so I don't think it's a dependency issue.

Is there a chance that in the same way a higher dosage would help here? Perhaps the first 10 mg make me more tired and the next 10 would possibly bring me to baseline energy with more focus?

For instance this morning I had huge amounts of energy but I was having trouble getting much done because I kept bouncing between things. After taking my Adderall I'm just dragging, I'm literally about to drink coffee to try and keep going so I don't risk falling asleep as the sun feels so nice lol.

I take care of her for probably an hour before I drop off her check and told her to let me know if she needed anything else kinda thing. I expected she would leave within the next 30 min- hour since she liked to sit. In the meantime, it‚Äôs Friday night and we get slammed.

She‚Äôs like ‚ÄúMore fresh coffee!! And pie!!!‚Äù Like, okay???? Why didn‚Äôt you say you were gonna order more when I dropped off your check???? Why try to get mad at me like I forgot, 2 HOURS later as you see us completely packed???

It‚Äôs a Friday night, we didn‚Äôt have fresh coffee anymore. Had to make her a new pot, get her stupid pie, and she sat for another hour or more??!! Idk I lost track at this point. She comes up to me as she‚Äôs leaving and hands me my $4 tip. She was sitting at one of my tables for about 3/4 of my shift, felt entitled to yell at me while I‚Äôm in the weeds, and then left a $4 tip. Fuck you.

1gndl9d,https://www.reddit.com/r/BrantSteele/comments/1gndl9d/bb_big_brother_world_1_coffee_house/,[BB] Big Brother World 1: Coffee House,"Hello again, everyone!   It's time for our 8th edition of Big Brother World 1!   If you're new here, welcome!   I'm running a large scale project that aims to make many simulations of Big Brother using BrantSteele's Big Brother Basic Template.  This is part of a celebration project that I'm doing to commemorate the 25 year anniversary since the filming of the first ever edition of Big Brother (Netherlands 1, filmed in 1999!).   My goal is to eventually simulate many editions of Big Brother World using every contestant that's ever played the game.    
  
For this first season, I'm taking all 180 contestants that played in the 13 editions of the show that aired from 1999-2000 (combining two years worth due to 1999 only having the inaugural Big Brother Netherlands season and no other editions), and divvying them up into 13 (nearly) evenly divided houses.   Then, I randomize everyone's relationship stats to each other, along with their personality and challenge stats.   Finally, I add some custom events to try and spice things up a bit and run the simulation to see what happens!   After all 13 editions have been run, I'll run a 14th simulation using all the winners in order to crown a Big Brother World champion!

I'm also giving each of our houses a unique color and name in order to differentiate them from each other (and because it's more fun than calling something House #8).  This edition of Big Brother World takes place in the Coffee House!  
  
 

https://preview.redd.it/5ehzed8jvvzd1.jpg?width=497&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=512a3a51d3ab0ba87a3634262b7fda8d762079da

Brown might not be the most exciting color out there, but the houseguests will be grateful for living here!  As you might guess from the title of the house, the Coffee House takes a very strong influence from local coffee shops with its art and furniture, in particular, a modern style.  This means lots of geometric furniture, textured fabrics, light wood tones to go along with cool metal accents (stainless steel as an example).  The main colors throughout the house are brown and cream, with some room even having different wall colors to reflect a few possible tastes in coffee (Black to reflect no cream in coffee, Dark Brown to reflect coffee with light cream, A nice even Brown to reflect moderate cream in coffee preferences, and even very Light Brown to reflect the tastes of those who like a little coffee with their cream!).   No surprise here, but there are sophisticated coffee machines and the houseguests will be blessed with some very high quality coffee during their stay.  If you like a good cup of joe, you'll love it here!

Speaking of staying in the Coffee House, let's go over the contestants that will be competing on this edition of Big Brother World!  If the last edition of the show seemed heavy on contestants that did poorly on their seasons, the Coffee House features quite a more successful feel to it.  I didn't track how many actual winners each of these editions has, but I'd guess the Coffee House has the most real winners in it with 4, so that's cool!  This I believe is also the first house that does NOT feature contestants from all real life editions of the show ran in 1999-2000 (Nobody from Big Brother UK 1 or Grande Fratello 1 this time). Given the draft styled nature as to how I divided the houseguests, some of the editions with fewer houseguests won't have houseguests in each of my Big Brother World editions, which is slightly unfortunate, but perhaps inevitable.  Here's the houseguests!

Bianca, 25, Civil Servant (Big Brother Netherlands 1):  There isn't very much on Bianca, as it turns out.  One of the contestants on the first ever edition of Big Brother, she would stay for a little over a month. However, a bribe twist was introduced that allowed two people to earn money if they quit the game.  Bianca would be one of the two that would take up the offer and so her time in the house would end.

Jona, 20, Unknown (Big Brother Germany 1): Big Brother Wiki says that she was considered a shy natured person that was very sensitive.   Jona would enter the house a couple weeks into the season due to a early quitter.  Being the quiet type, she didn't endear herself to the other houseguests early on and would be immediately nominated for eviction.  Interestingly, she actually would survive her time on the block despite being up against another woman who had been in the game from the start.  That's something of a rarity I'm finding with these early cast members, usually the newbies that get immediately nominated get evicted easily!  While Jona would warm up to the others and never receive a nomination vote again, she wouldn't be long for the game.  After missing her freedom, she would herself quit the game after being in the house for just over a month.  

Vanesa, 19, Baker (Gran Hermano Spain 1): At 19, Vanesa is one of our youngest contestants ever (and definitely is for this edition!).   She was apparently a rather despised houseguest, however.  Big Brother Wiki points to her swearing on the show (I'd assume this was done while the show was live?), which evidently caused some controversy in the country (apparently, swearing is all it takes to be a villain in Spain... at least in the year 2000 anyway).  The houseguests only threw a couple nomination votes her way each week though.  Thanks to Gran Hermano Spain 1's odd trait of always having a ton of people on the block that season (seriously, only once time did that show have fewer than 4 people face the public vote on the block!), Vanesa would survive her first nomination (when somehow, every single one of the 10 houseguests get nominated despite there being a normal nomination process), but would get evicted a little over a month into the show (where once again, all vulnerable houseguests somehow got nominated), with 46.84% of the vote facing a five person block.  She'd apparently start a family with another houseguest and they're possibly still together?  

Harry, 50, Pop Group Drukwerk Singer (Big Brother Netherlands VIP): Not much to say here.  Harry was part of a pop group as a singer.  He's also by far our oldest houseguest in this edition of Big Brother World, being 14 years old than the next oldest contestant (though there is one houseguest that I don't know the age of).  It's just a random simulation, but it'll be fun to still see how Harry holds up against his younger houseguests!

Monique, 32, TV Presenter and Playboy Model (Big Brother Netherlands VIP): Monique's claim to fame being (in part) a Playboy Model could be interesting, in terms of seeing how well she could socialize with her fellow houseguests.  Of course, one could see her hitting it off well with some contestants and perhaps not be well liked at all by others, Monique in a realistic setting could be a polarizing person.   But this is just a simple simulator, so for all I know, she could win this easily (I haven't seen the results yet and won't until I post this!).

Jordan, 26, Exotic Dancer (Big Brother US 1): Jordan would not be long for the game, being just the second person evicted from the show.   They'd have a tough go at it too, getting nominated both rounds of the game and receiving 10 total nomination votes.  The second time around, Jordan would get evicted with 78% of the public vote, the biggest blowout that anyone would receive.   Worse is that, according to Big Brother Wiki, they got evicted on their birthday!  Ouch!  The fan site notes that Jordan did apparently get into something of a love triangle with a guy and a gal during their time in the house, that'd have been fun to watch how awkward it might get.

Daniela, 29, Clerk (Big Brother Switzerland 1): Daniela would face the block a few times during her stay in the Big Brother house, and received at least one vote in all but one round to boot.  However, while her fellow houseguests (one in particular, who nominated her nearly every single week) might not have totally loved her, the audience appears to have.  Daniela would survive each and every visit to the block and in the end, would win the final public vote with 58.44% of the vote between her and the runner up to become the winner of Big Brother Switzerland.

Steven, 25, Financial Advisor (Big Brother Belgium 1): The winner of Big Brother Belgium, Steven was evidently quite the character.  He'd rebel on multiple occasions against Big Brother.  First, he'd refused to nominate anyone in the 3rd round.  After numerous threats where made to him (including the removal of a completely unrelated houseguest!!!), Steven would try to quit (Big Brother, perhaps immediately seeing how popular he probably was, refused to let him before talking to a psychiatrist first) and when that failed, actually make a mad scramble up the roof of the house and stayed for two hours.  After he cooled down and returned, the producers made him ""stand trail"" while the other houseguests chose whether to let him stay or not.  Surprisingly, they let him stay.  Later on, in Week 12, he'd remove some door hinges and throw them over the fence.  This time, Big Brother punished him by making him choose to either immediately leave the house or to run a marathon on a treadmill in less than 8 hours.  He'd do the marathon.  Honestly, I have no idea how true these stories are, (these come from Wikipedia itself), but this goofball had to have made for some great television, which is probably why Big Brother tolerated him at all.   He wasn't too popular with his fellow houseguests, given his remarkable 25 total nomination votes and 6 trips to the eviction block!   In the end, against his fellow two finalists, Steven would be declared the winner of Big Brother Belgium in a very close vote, receiving 41% of the vote (against 38% and 21% that the other two received). 

Ze Maria, 27, Construction Worker (Big Brother Portugal 1): We don't have near the amount of information on Big Brother Portugal as we did with Big Brother Belgium, but it's interesting that Ze Maria would have a similar trajectory to victory as Steven (and Daniela also from Switzerland) did in their seasons.   Ze Maria would receive many nomination votes during his stay in the Big Brother house, with 23 total.  Not surprisingly, with so many nominations, he'd face the public vote several times.  We don't have eviction percentages for this show, so it's impossible to know for sure if he ever came close to being evicted or not, but he would indeed survive all 5 trips to the block.   In the end, in a three person finale, Ze Maria would be declared the winner.  I think this all suggests that he was probably very popular from the very beginning and thus, his safety during all the evictions was probably a certain thing each time.

Riquita, 28, English Teacher (Big Brother Portugal 1):  From winner to first evicted.  Riquita had the misfortunate of being the victim involved in Big Brother Portugal's first twist.   There were no nominations in the first round of the show, instead everyone was automatically nominated and faced the public vote.   Only having 3 days to play the game, Riquita would be the unlucky person voted out of the house in this vote.   What did she do that got her evicted?  I dunno, couldn't find anything.  Perhaps a fresh start could lead to a more promising result this time (or perhaps not).

Daniel, ??, Unknown (Big Brother Sverige 1): There's absolutely no way to know if Daniel could have done well in Big Brother Sverige 1 had he stuck it out.  He could have been a fan favorite and gone far or maybe he'd have been evicted quickly.  What we do know is that Daniel would quit the game after only being in the house for 3 days, I'm guessing that the pressures of being on camera 24/7 must have gotten to him (or maybe it was for another reason, who knows?).   Either way, he gets his 2nd chance here, let's see if he does anything with it (or even if he just quits again, which would be pretty funny admittedly.  Again, haven't seen the results yet, so I don't know what happens with him).

Rex, 36, Teacher (Big Brother Netherlands 2): Alright, looks like we have a new record holder here!   Rex, entering the house a couple weeks into Big Brother Netherlands 2's run, would survive a whooping 2 days in the house!   Until Daniel, whose short stay was due to him quitting quickly and Riquita, who got faced with a house wide public eviction vote early in her game, Rex's demise was due to him entering the house with another lady, the two of them facing a house vote to determine who would get to stay.  Rex would fail to receive even one vote, leading to his eviction.  This time, he'll get more time to work with, so let's see what he does with this chance!

Alida, 23, Law Student (Big Brother Germany 2): Alida is our final winner out of this cast, but did she ever have a much more easy time winning her season!  Apparently, Big Brother Germany 2 had several arguments and misunderstandings (per Wikipedia), but Alida managed to keep herself out of trouble.  Considered a quiet and friendly member of the house, Alida somehow managed to make it through the entirety of the game without ever receiving a single nomination vote!  That's quite incredible, actually!  She'd easily win the final public vote too, getting 73.13% of the vote, her total victory was probably rarely in doubt, if I had to guess.  After her time on the show, she'd stick to television and become a presenter for many years, even cohosting a future season of Big Brother Germany!  

Jorg, 31, Multi-Media Designer (Big Brother Germany 2): Jorg had a decent start to his time on Big Brother, managing to avoid getting any nomination votes for a few weeks.   However, a month into the show, he'd finally receive his first (and last) 4 nomination votes, earning him a trip to the block.  Jorg was up against a newbie (and one other guy), so his survival in theory was probably likely (though you never know, I guess).  He wouldn't face the vote, however, instead walking from the game before the public vote could determine his fate.

That's our cast!  If you'd like to see how this plays out, I have the link before to follow the action!

It had been cranking out coffees for 20 computer scientists every day for about 6 years at that point, and then it lasted us another 5 with regular at-home use for 2 adults.

I was not aware of it until yesterday, but my long-suffering guy has been hating the morning brews I've been making in the meantime with my $25 Mr. Coffee pot from Target. I'm OK with it in the meantime, but he says it tastes like swill and he misses his fancy morning beverages. I certainly agree the Jura coffee was better, but it always tasted a little weak to me. 

I want to get him something even better than the Jura for Christmas, if that's possible. I'd love a Black Friday Deal, but at the end of the day, money is no object. Counter space is limited though. Hook me up with a recommendation.",3,1731168797.0,superautomatic,7,1.0,False
1gndhi7,https://www.reddit.com/r/massachusetts/comments/1gndhi7/now_is_a_great_time_to_fund_worker_ownership/,Now is a great time to fund worker ownership & resident ownership in New England,"The [Cooperative Fund of the Northeast](https://cooperativefund.org/) (previously the Cooperative Fund of New England before they expanded to include New York) is an investment fund that provides low-interest loans to entities like:

\- Democratic worker-owned cooperative businesses

\- Local cooperative markets where consumers can buy a stake in their retail provider

\- Cooperatively owned housing, including resident-owned manufactured housing parks.

If you are at all interested in workers owning their workplaces, or residents owning their homes, investing in the CFNE is a safe and reliable way to contribute. It's not as lucrative as other forms of investment - [1.25% per year for an investment with no minimum time requirement, up to 3.5% per year for a minimum 10-year investment](https://cooperativefund.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/CFNE-2024-2025-Interest-Rate-Sheet.pdf). However, this is because as mentioned the loans they provide are lower-cost than regular bank loans, aimed specifically at institutions that need them the most.

If you've got money sitting in a bank account, put it to work. The more people invest in the CFNE, the more resources they will have to support worker & resident ownership.

Also, while a lot of worker cooperatives are very local, [Equal Exchange](https://shop.equalexchange.coop/) does online delivery of things like tea, coffee, chocolate, dried fruit, and nuts, so support them too if you can.",29,1731168778.0,massachusetts,1,0.84,False

My Instagram feed was starting to feel like a black hole of forgotten memories, so I decided to do something radical: print actual photos. 

This led me to checking out the Kodak Mini 2 Retro photo printer, and here's what happened next.

# First Impressions

It's adorably compact, like if a Pop-Tart decided to become a printer. At first glance, it looks like something Fisher-Price might make if they decided to venture into office supplies (but I mean that in the best possible way!)

The setup process was painless, and I say this as someone who once spent three hours trying to connect to my own WiFi network (only to realize I was trying to hack my neighbor's).

Also, the app downloaded faster than my usual self-doubt, and before I knew it, I was ready to bring my digital disasters into the physical world.

# My Favorite Features

**4PASS technology:**  The 4PASS thing layers colors like a lasagna of printing, which gives you photos that actually look like, well, photos. Each print goes through four passes (yellow, magenta, cyan, and a protective coating), which sounds like a lot of work, but hey, good things come to those who wait... approximately 60 seconds.

**Portable:** I've taken it to family gatherings, friend meetups, and that one awkward dinner party where having an escape activity literally saved my social life. Every time I pull it out, someone inevitably asks, ""Is that a tiny boombox?"" or ""Did you steal that from a dollhouse?"" It's become my party trick, my ice breaker, and my excuse to avoid small talk all rolled into one adorable package.

**Wireless connection:** The Bluetooth connection is more stable than my last relationship. Once paired, it remembers your device like an elephant with a photographic memory (printer puns, anyone?). The range is decent ‚Äì you can be in another room and still print, perfect for those I'm at a party but need a moment alone moments.

**Mobile app:** It's got filters, frames, and editing options that range from ""actually useful"" to ""why would anyone ever need this?"" The interface is intuitive enough that even my tech-adverse mother could use it, which is saying something considering she still double-clicks everything on her smartphone.

**Print quality:** The 2.1 x 3.4-inch photos come out looking like they were professionally done, assuming the professional isn't having an existential crisis. Colors are vibrant, details are sharp, and the protective coating means your fingerprints won't turn every photo into a crime scene.

# Pros

**Photo durability:** These prints are pretty tough. Water-resistant, fingerprint-proof, and supposedly lasting up to 100 years (though I haven't had time to verify this claim personally). I've subjected these prints to various real-world tests ‚Äì they've survived coffee spills, being stuffed in wallet, and even an encounter with my friend's toddler, who seems to have supernatural destruction abilities.

**Size and portability:** It's smaller than my emotional baggage and twice as useful. Perfect for spontaneous printing sessions or impromptu scrapbooking interventions. The compact size means you can carry it anywhere, though be prepared for TSA agents to look at it like it's an alien artifact.

**Print quality:** The color reproduction is surprisingly accurate ‚Äì my food photos actually look appetizing, which is more than I can say for my actual cooking. Skin tones come out natural, which is a miracle considering most printers seem to think humans should be either orange or purple.

**Easy setup:** If you can operate a smartphone and possess basic motor skills, you're overqualified to use this printer. The learning curve is gentler than a bunny slope, and the instruction manual isn't written in that cryptic language that seems to be standard for most tech products.

# Cons

* Battery life is shorter than my attention span (about 20-25 prints per charge)
* The app occasionally has the temperament of a toddler
* Print costs add up faster than my streaming service subscriptions
* Limited to small format prints (though maybe that's good for my wall space management)
* The printer makes a sound like a tiny robot while printing

# Final Thoughts

The KODAK Mini 2 Retro is perfect for anyone who's ever looked at their phone's camera roll and thought, I should print some of these photos one day. It's ideal for scrapbookers, memory keepers, and anyone who wants physical photos without the commitment of a full-size printer.

In real-world use, it's become an unexpected social catalyst. At parties, it transforms from a simple printer into a memory-making machine. There's something magical about being able to capture a moment and immediately share physical copies with friends ‚Äì it's like Instagram, but you can actually hold it, and no one can leave uncomfortable comments.
