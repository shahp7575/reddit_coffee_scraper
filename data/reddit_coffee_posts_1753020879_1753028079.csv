I am a 55-year old, amicably divorced man (with a 28-year old daughter who lives on her own) looking for a long-term partner.  I am bright and well-educated, I'm intellectually curious, and I have a wide variety of interests.  I'm also the type of person who generally becomes interested in the things that my partner is interested in.

I work for myself, exclusively from home, so my schedule is quite flexible, and, while I'm not wealthy, I make a decent living.  The majority of my free time is spent listening to podcasts, exercising, watching sports, watching film/TV, or hiking (day trips -- I am not much of a camper).  I love music and have sung in a large number of choirs/ensembles through the years, but I am not currently signing with any groups.

I am an introvert, but I am very socially able.  People who have just met me are almost always surprised that I describe myself as an introvert, because I am confident and outgoing in social situations.  I call myself an introvert because I prefer to spend time alone or in small groups.  I don't need a fellow introvert as a partner, as long as said partner isn't a social butterfly; I am fine doing social things 2-3 times per week -- I just require time to recharge after a social outing.

I am very progressive, both on social issues and fiscal/governmental issues, and my politics are very important to me.  Having said that, I don't need a partner who is willing to discuss politics with me (though that would be optimal); any potential partner would, however, need to lean pretty strongly to the left or we simply won't see eye-to-eye on most important issues.  I am also an atheist.  I am not anti-religion, but, it's unlikely that I would be compatible with someone who has strong religious beliefs.

I am a VERY open person -- I am happy to discuss anything about my life (current or past), as I have nothing to hide (even though I've made my fair share of mistakes).  I recognize the importance of both open communication and mutual respect.  I have strong opinions and I have no trouble expressing them, but I don't mind if  people disagree with me (unless their position has no basis in fact/reason).  I am a control freak with respect to MYSELF, but I have no interest in controlling others.  I am witty and ""punny"", I have a good sense of humor, and I have no trouble being laughed AT.  I am studious and can be very serious when the situation requires it, but I can also be a complete goofball (and, honestly, I am goofy far more often than I am serious)

Following are some facts/qualities that make me somewhat unusual (other than the length of this post):

I was an elite distance runner in HS and hoped to run for the US Olympic Team (which did not happen); I have never had an alcoholic beverage or tried any recreational drugs (I am fine with having a partner who drinks responsibly, but smoking or recreational drugs are dealbreakers); I am an incredibly picky eater -- I eat like 10 things in a ""rotation"" (so I am the polar opposite of a ""foodie"", and I spend as little time cooking as possible); I have had more surgeries than I have fingers (and I have the usual number of fingers); I have never had a cup of coffee (I don't care for the smell, and taste is 75% to 95% smell); I got perfect scores on the SAT, ACT, GRE, GMAT, and LSAT (but I am not pretentious or condescending on the least); I have had a wide variety of jobs, from bartender to sports writer to actuary to professional poker player; and I am still a very good athlete, especially at racquet sports (so I can probably help you if you aspire to become a competitive pickleball player).

My current reading list is dominated by books about neuroscience, scientific advancements, and chemistry (I am teaching myself the AP Chemistry curriculum in the hope of teaching it before long).  Some of my favorite recent shows are: ""Silo"", ""Severance"", Ted Lasso"", and ""The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel"" (though I am not Jewish).  I like most movie genres, but tend to watch action movies, rom-coms, or comedies these days -- there is so much sad stuff going on in the world that I tend to prefer feel-good movies/TV.  I don't watch any ""reality TV"" (though I did watch a few seasons of ""American Idol"" and like 10 seasons of ""So You Think You Can Dance""), but I'm fine with a potential partner who does -- I don't think that ALL of a pairs' hobbies must be shared.

I am looking for a bright, intellectually curious, mature woman age 35+ who is left-leaning (at a minimum), physically active and would like to find an equal/partner.  I would like to find someone who has opinions of her own to talk about life and share experiences WITH.  I am hoping to connect via chat/message while we make sure there is common ground and the appropriate ""chemistry"", after which we can move on from Reddit.

Finally, here are couple of recent photos of me:

1m4snw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadByDaylightKillers/comments/1m4snw8/giving_my_rework_on_killers_i_like_trapper/,Giving my rework on killers I like: trapper,"Ahhh, trapper. My favorite killer. He was the first one I played back in 2016 when my sister let me play on her PC. And now? He’s a joke. He takes far too long to prepare, everyone can easily outdo him by gen-rushing and quickly disarming his traps, and without his traps, he’s a M1 killer who has no abilities. So let’s try to give my boy a re-work. 

1. (in)finite traps:
Collecting traps is the worst part of playing trapper. You have to walk across the map, plop traps down every few spots, then look for more traps and repeat. It’s horrible. So here are my two ideas on fixing this:
A-give him traps inside of lockers, instead of on the ground. Make it like huntress-where he can spend more time preparing and less time walking around. The trapper bags would be changed to allow him to collect more traps from the lockers; base kit is two, trapper bag is three, and leather bag will allow five. 
B-let him start with all of his traps in the beginning of the match (10-20). The bags would instead change how many traps he starts with by their base numbers-trapper bag would be two extra, and leather bag would be three extra. This would eliminate both of the issues trapper has-being that he has to walk across the map to collect new traps, and being able to quickly set up areas of the map. 

2. Ankle biter:
Now his bear traps in question. The traps are decent, don’t get me wrong-but the issue is when a survivor breaks out of them. Many of his add-ons don’t help him if he bear traps a opponent and they escape-usually they only slow down healing, and only one can knock down the survivor trapped, that being the honing stone. So let’s change them a little, with two separate lanes of change we can choose.
A-lose the speed, but lose the speed:
Simply put, because trapper wouldn’t need to zoom across the map to collect more traps, trade the temporary haste for a temporary hindrance on survivors who escape. You just took a bear trap to the ankle-you won’t be walking or running around as easily. Keep the coffee grounds, but change it so that he gains the 5-7% haste when setting bear traps so that players who may want the haste can still have it. 
B-latch-on:
The bear traps aren’t exactly nailed down-it doesn’t make much sense that survivors can take several hooks being impaled into their torsos and keep running, can have a baby biting into their neck and keep running, but they get stuck in place when a bear trap hits them. So, instead of keeping them in place, bear traps will instead cause several de-buffs to movement. Firstly, the survivor will suffer from massive hindrance-maybe 20-40% max. Secondly, they will be exhausted, and unable to use vault locations. This means that, even though they took a bear trap, they still have some sort of defense, in the form of pallets, also making the trappers perk of destroying pallets quicker much more useful. Those pallets are the only form of defense when they get bear trapped-and every one wasted is much more pressure during chase. Bear traps can then be un-latched from a survivors legs when in safety, creating a loud notification and leaving the trap behind on the ground. Though, the temporary stun from being caught in a bear trap should stay in my opinion. 

3: unpopular opinions:
A-nom nom:
Disarming a bear trap with your bare hands doesn’t sound safe at all-so instead, give the survivors punishment in the form of deep wound when interacting with bear traps. So, instead of punishing them too harshly for undoing bear traps, it’s much more inconvenient. If a survivor already has deep wound and un-does a bear trap, then maybe they’ll be put into the injured state and be inflicted with deep wound. 

Aaaand that’s it! With the ability to collect traps easier, and having some more play to hinder movement when hit by a bear trap, trapper would be much better than the state he’s in today. However, I really think that allowing him to collect bear traps in a different way would shoot him up in power already-all the other changes are only really ideas I had and wanted to share.

I used to swim competitively when I was 13 but then went on a 8 year hiatus.

I'm 21 and on a semester break now and have recently started training hard (6-8 am) for events on a daily basis (Mondays off). This has been causing immense body ache in my traps, triceps, wings and during practice, my core.

Here's the problem - after returning home, I'm fine. Bust as soon as I finish lunch, I feel way too darn sleepy. I sleep till 9 until my mother yells at me and I end up staying awake till 3am.

1m4smeo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4smeo,Fireplace Angle in Living Room / Where to Put My TV?,"Hi! I'm looking to buy a townhouse in a particular development. They all have this living room layout, with the fireplace at this odd angle. I'm wrestling with where to put the ""living space"" with sofa, coffee table, end tables, a couple of armchairs and TV; and where to put my dining room table. I don't have to be limited by where the chandelier is - I can have an electrician move that (I'd replace it anyway). 

I'd love to be able to see the fireplace from the sofa, but can't figure out how to make that work. 

The only layout I can think of is to have the TV against the wall on one side or the other, with seating in front of it so that the sofa is placed vertically kind of in the center of the room and with its back to the dining table. (I hope that makes sense!) I'm not a fan of wall-mounted TVs - I don't want to have to crane my neck to watch TV - but, I also had the perhaps-crazy thought of placing the whole seating arrangement at an angle right in front of the fireplace, and mounting the TV above the fireplace.

I've looked at so many pictures of the living rooms in this development, some of them beautifully staged, and not a one of 'em has a TV in the living room. I truly don't understand why having a TV in a staged room is so taboo! Much to many designers' chagrin, people \*do\* gather round to watch TV in the vast majority of American living rooms, certainly in mine, and so it has to be considered in the layout.

I also hate seeing sofas that are perpendicular to a TV. I don't want to have to sit sideways to watch TV either. 

Having said all that, does anyone have an idea for layout that I haven't thought of? Thanks so much! ",1,1753027514.0,DesignMyRoom,1,1.0,False

I didn’t know who to ask so I decided to come on here. I grew up muslim, but my dad isn’t strict, it’s more culture than religious. Witchcraft is considered forbidden and seen as “dark” or “bad” in both the culture and religion, which makes it extra hard to be open about this. The weird things is, my culture actually has a lot of “witchy” stuff before Islam, like reading coffee cups, old traditions, folk magic and beliefs, but now anything like that is seen as dangerous or bad. I’ve always been drawn to witchcraft. I read tarot cards (I had to convince my dad they were “just for fun”), and my older cousin taught me how to read coffee cups (in secret ofc). I also have crystals, but my dad just thinks they’re for decoration. I’d love to have an alter with herbs and tools, but I feel like that would be crossing the line with him. He’s pretty open minded, I even told him I believe in multiple gods and he was very chill about it. But I think witchcraft would be too much for him, since he’d assume it’s all harmful magic. it’s not that he finds it stupid or dumb, he knows it’s real as he has experienced some stuff, but he doesn’t know there’s good to it if that makes sense. Has anyone else been in a similar situation? How do you practice secretly or explain that witchcraft can be positive and not just “bad magic”?

1m4siji,https://www.reddit.com/r/2000treesfestival/comments/1m4siji/first_time_vip_camping_thoughtsreviewfixes/,First Time VIP Camping - Thoughts/Review/Fixes,"First time doing VIP this year so thought I'd throw down some thoughts as I struggled with finding too much info like this last year, plus it'll be up to date from 2025's festival experiences. Also included some potential fixes they could maybe do (hopefully) without being too ridiculous/entitled :).

Perks overview and thoughts:

\*\*Carparking...\*\*  
I thought placement was fine, it was at the right end of the main carpark at least and the journey to the camping spot was waaaay better than general camping (no horrible hill, one way bridge and lots closer). The main issue I had with this was that because we had to queue down the road to all get into the same carpark entrance, we lost valuable time meaning we missed the first few bands (inc Vower who I really wanted to see). It was the Wednesday so you kind of pay to see those extra bands so don't want to miss any. I could have tried to get there a tiny bit earlier but I thought 12:30 would still be ok and not mega late.

\*\*Wristband pickup...\*\*  
The queue for this on Wednesday was really annoying. It took ages and like the carparking issue, cost time missing bands. In general camping, I never remember really having to queue at all the previous year.

\*\*Showers...\*\*  
Still had to pay, still had to queue. I didn't bother using them in the end as I just didn't want to queue.

Having free showers tokens or something in VIP would be nice but also appreciate its something that needs to be paid for and looked after (maybe half price showers for VIP??) so can't complain too much about the payment side.

\*\*Camping...\*\*   
This wasn't great tbh. The ground was really slope-y and bumpy and the space was quite tight. We maybe got to the field around 1pm-ish on the Wednesday and have to just find gaps rather than really having a very good choice. Tbf, everyone else there was VIP anyway so they just got there earlier. It was a shame cause the general camping field is much much better and there is always plenty of decent places anytime on the Wednesday. 

There was also hardly any toilets or water points in VIP camping. Wasn't a dealbreaker but going to either was a long way. 

Loved how quiet it was, go to the arena for noise but nice and quiet in the camping area which was great.

\*\*Access to arena...\*\*  
This was pretty decent, it was great to be able to get to the coffee van and Neu stage super quick in the mornings for the first band of each day. Ideal also to do quick runs back to the tent in the day and get back to the stages. Can't complain too much with this.

\*\*VIP platform...\*\*  
Didn't use this as it was way too hot. Could be a good way to get some shade near the main stage? Lack of shade generally  near the main stage was a big issue for me as it was so hot and difficult to see a band without getting burnt.

\*\*VIP bar...\*\*  
This was decent, really like the shade it provided so it was nice to pop in. Only thing is that it was very busy a lot of the time so that put us off sometimes (or made it not an option sometimes).

\*\*VIP merch...\*\*  
Also good. Great to have a t-shirt, lanyard and tote. Would be cool to have had the bands on the back of the t-shirt or different colours but can understand that they would want to keep the incentive to also buy the main t-shirt too.



\*\*\*\*IMO making VIP better (easy-ish wins or without it costing the festival too much):\*\*\*\*

\- Entrance time - allow VIP to get in an hour earlier on the Wednesday at least (so 11). This would allow less queueing down the road to the carpark.

\- Carpark - Go back to the alternative entrance, allow/encourage VIP-ers to approach from the other direction to be able to get in quicker.

\- VIP showers - half price VIP, open an hour earlier to ease queues.

\- Wristband pickup - could the merch pickup be done at a different station? Feel like they could do the wristband hand out by moving down the queue too so everyone isn't bottlenecking at that single tent? You could then pickup merch later in the day between bands?

\- Camping - not sure on this other than having a better, flatter field but then I guess you sacrifice distance which is a benefit I wouldn't want to lose. Get there bang on 12 instead of 12:30 I guess. Also add some more toilets and water points.

\- VIP platform - put shade over it so its bearable watching bands in blazing sun or rain!

\- VIP bar - maybe expand the shade bit a little more and have a bit more seating.

\- VIP merch - do the t-shirt in different colours, especially with the heat, a white version would have been awesome. 

Overall, I really enjoyed the festival but imo VIP is only worth it (especially mathematically) if you get it during the 30% off period.

There are spots all over the mirror and that toilet is just as gross as the first one. The toilet seat in the master bathroom has yellowish brown stains on it.

Beyond the obvious 300mg of caffeine, there's sucralose, artificial colors, and something called natural flavors that could be literally anything. I ran it through the Prove It app and there were several ingredients flagged for potential sleep disruption and skin irritation.

I've been trying to cut back but honestly I don't know how to maintain my energy levels without them. The coffee at my weekend job is terrible and doesn't give me the same sustained energy",4,1753027016.0,energydrinks,0,1.0,False

I'm aiming for a 300-500 deficit, alternating 50mins on my stationary bike or 30mins of yoga daily. For the most part I'm eating the same things I usually do just less of it and trying to eat more fruits/vegetables and fibre.

Overall I feel really good so far, the exercise has been great for my mental health and I'm not focused on numbers or measurements, just body changes and gaining strength as time passes. Things I've noticed so far:

\- I'm consciously hungry a LOT more now, lunch used to just be something I did out of habit in the middle of the day but now I'm actually HUNGRY for it

\- My sleep has been better and I'm less bloated but that's probably from drinking a lot more water as well

\- I've learned that I NEED to have a snack in the afternoon or I feel a bit nauseous/dizzy, it was hard at first to give myself permission thanks to old habits but I just have some fruit or a granola bar and I'm fine

\- Weirdly specific but coffee used to make me really nauseous and that just doesn't happen anymore

This is my first time trying to lose weight sustainably with lifestyle changes and I'm really worried about going too far too fast and putting it all back on again or causing myself health issues, is this normal so far and is there anything I should look out for to know if I'm doing too much/not enough?",1,1753027016.0,loseit,4,0.67,False

So I went from a BBQ drum roaster (years ago), to a popcorn popper (topped with a cut soup can), to a chinese roaster (damn 220v!!!), now I have a freshroast sr800. 

Ive done four roasts with the SR800 and it feels like I am driving with gut instinct, but like Rob Gordon says in High Fidelity, ""Sometimes my gut has shit for brains"". 

So while I can find anecdotal accounts and the odd roast profile posted, my question to the roasted crowd is:

**Is there an active, easy, roast profile database that is shared by everyone, that can be easily contributed to and accessed freely?** 

I would love to post profiles I have come up with and would really love to see what profiles work for other people. 

I may only be rocking the sr800 but a simple ""roasted at 415F for X minutes, then lowered temp to 400 for X minutes, waited for first crack then roasted for another X minutes at 390 before cooling beans"", would be awesome. ",2,1753027011.0,roasting,1,1.0,False

1m4s7ut,https://i.redd.it/k4mfnmlvv1ef1.png,The Neighbor's Panties in My Bed? Here's Your Invite to Nightmare,"Chapter 1



Halfway through my shower, the doorbell rang.



I ignored it. It rang again.



I stepped out of the bathroom and opened the door to find a girl standing outside.



""I'm your new neighbor. I left something at your place—mind if I grab it real quick?""



Before I could agree, she rushed straight to my room, pulled out a pair of lace panties from under my fiancé's pillow, and said with a flushed face:



""My water got cut off yesterday, and I was desperate, so I came over to use your shower. Hope you don't mind.""



She left with her underwear, and I slumped back onto my couch in a daze.



After sitting there for what felt like forever, I finally got up—only to feel something weird under the cushions.



I pulled it out and instantly hurled it across the room—it was a goddamn used condom?!



Bile shot up my throat.



I couldn't hold it back anymore. I bolted to the bathroom and threw up until I was seeing stars.



I was so out of it that I didn't even notice when Rhett came home and found me there.



""Wren, babe, what's wrong?""



The concern in his eyes looked genuine enough. He helped me to my feet, his hand steady on my shoulder.



""What happened? Should I take you to the hospital?""



I stared at his face—not a single crack in that perfect mask.



Doubt began creeping into my mind—was I being too paranoid?



A pair of underwear and a used condom didn't necessarily mean anything.



Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.



Maybe I was just being crazy.



My eyes were bloodshot as Rhett helped me onto the couch. I wrapped my hands around the warm water he'd brought me and shook my head.



""I'm fine. Probably just caught a chill last night.""



Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were kids.



I shouldn't be doubting twenty-five years of history between us.



I shouldn't be tearing down the walls of trust we'd built together over some stupid paranoia.



I pulled myself together and gave him a reassuring smile. ""Really, I'm okay. Don't worry about it.""



Our wedding was just around the corner.



Nobody wants their relationship to fall apart right before their big day—including me.



Rhett gently stroked my hair and said, ""Let me make you some vegetable soup.""



I nodded, watching his retreating figure with a warm feeling in my chest.



Right as I was scrolling through TikTok, waiting for the soup, the doorbell rang again.



I stayed put on the couch and heard Rhett call out:



""Wren, can you get that? I'm kinda tied up here.""



I glanced toward the kitchen where he was locked in battle with some hairy crabs.



I laughed and went to open the door, only to find that same neighbor girl standing outside.



She scratched her head sheepishly. ""I didn't cook tonight. Mind if I crash your dinner?""



The apartment across the hall had been empty for two years. Suddenly there's a new neighbor, and I had no clue about it?



What kind of person moves in and immediately shows up asking for free meals?



I was about to tell her no when she looped her arm through mine and held up a cup of bubble tea.



""I brought boba! The more the merrier, right? And don't worry—I'll totally take your trash away when I leave!""



She didn't give me a chance to refuse, practically dragging me back inside.



As the same time, Rhett emerged from the kitchen carrying a bowl of soup, smiling as he asked:



""Who was it?""



When he saw the neighbor girl's face, his expression went stone cold.



She chirped up playfully: ""Hey there, Rhett! I'm here to mooch some food. Your girlfriend invited me—hope that's cool?""



Rhett's gaze shifted to me.



I didn't bother sugarcoating it. ""I never did that.""



I yanked my arm free from the neighbor's grip. Pointing at the bubble tea, I said to Rhett, ""Looks like you've been having a grand time while I was away.""



I'm not the type to suffer in silence.



There's no way Rhett couldn't see this girl had ulterior motives.



Maybe he was waiting for me to give him an out—waiting for me to say, ""Yeah, I totally invited her over for dinner.""



But I didn't want to.



I locked eyes with him, demanding an answer.



Chapter 2



Just like when we were kids and someone tried to come between us, Rhett would always say the same thing:



""In this whole wide world, Wren comes first. Of course I'm choosing Wren.""



I looked at Rhett, then at the neighbor girl, whose eyes were suddenly welling up with tears. She slammed the bubble tea down on the table and snapped:



""I seriously didn't mean anything by it! My power and water got cut off yesterday, so I came over to use your shower. I just wanted to thank you guys today—that's why I brought the boba!""



Her tears started streaming down.



""Do you really have to give me the cold shoulder like this?""



I still didn't respond. I kept my eyes locked on Rhett. He rubbed his temples, then walked over to the table, picked up the bubble tea, and handed it back to her.



""My girlfriend doesn't mess around. Letting you in yesterday was my mistake. You should go.""



The neighbor broke down even harder. ""We didn't do anything! Why is she acting like I'm some homewrecker?""



She made it sound like I was the one in the wrong.



But that condom on my couch, and the red hair I'd found—it was the exact same shade as this neighbor girl's.



I had no idea when Rhett, who usually kept strangers at arm's length, had become so generous that he'd let some random person into our home. Into our bathroom, no less.



A guy and a girl alone together. Who knows what could happen?



The neighbor turned her tear-streaked face toward me.



""I was just trying to be nice! You're the one with a dirty mind, so of course everything looks dirty to you! I just moved in—I don't want drama with my neighbors, but you're being way too much!""



By all logic, Rhett had asked her to leave. If she had any shame, she would've walked out. But she kept standing there, putting on a show. For whose benefit?



I looked at her, completely unmoved by her guilt trip.



""Fine. I'm being too much.""



I threw the door wide open.



""Please leave!""



This time, the neighbor couldn't stick around. She stamped her foot and ran out crying. The apartment fell dead silent. Rhett gave me a look that said he was at his wit's end.



""Wren, don't you think you went too far?""



Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were in diapers. When we were seventeen, Rhett bought up every firework in the entire city just to get me to agree to be his girlfriend, confessing his love under that dazzling display of lights.



""Wren, do you want to date me with marriage and growing old together as our endgame?""



I looked at my boy, trembling as he poured his heart out, and threw myself into his arms with tears in my eyes.



Our relationship had been smooth sailing ever since. Everyone envied me for having such a perfect childhood-friend-turned-fiancé.



And now, here he was, taking some random girl's side against me.



""You know how important reputation is to a girl. What you just said could get her labeled as a homewrecker!""



""Wren,"" Rhett walked past me, deliberately bumping my shoulder hard enough to make me stumble back. ""I was just trying to save your face, but that doesn't mean I think you were right.""



With that, He stormed out, leaving me alone with the lingering smell of soup.



Was I wrong?



Had I messed up?



When I was spiraling into self-doubt, my phone buzzed with a friend request notification.



Chapter 3



My heart skipped a beat as I saw videos from an unknown sender.



In the footage, Rhett was sitting on our couch with the neighbor girl, helping her blow out candles on a cake. His voice was sickeningly sweet:



""Happy Valentine's Day, babe.""



They kissed passionately.



They did the most intimate things imaginable in my apartment.



They were going at it in my bathtub, water sloshing everywhere like my heart was being dragged through broken glass, blood seeping from every wound. I watched the neighbor girl laugh brightly, making cute poses with Rhett for the camera.



""Today's me and Rhett's first Valentine's Day together! We're gonna have so many more!""



She asked him with a giggle: ""Will living next door to you cause problems?""



Rhett's face was flushed with alcohol as he pulled her closer.



""Nah. Wren and I go way back—she'd never suspect a thing. If I'm choosing to be with you, I'll protect you.""



The video cut to the present, showing the girl crying while Rhett held and comforted her: ""Wren's just blunt—she cares too much about me. Don't take it personally!""



""I promise I won't touch Wren anymore!""



""I'll save myself for you.""



The girl sobbed in his arms: ""But she saw right through me! I was just standing there, and she already hated me.""



""I wasn't trying to cause trouble—I just wanted to see you, babe.""



""What did I do wrong to deserve this?""



I watched Rhett's face fill with sympathy as he soothed her: ""Don't worry. I'll spend the next few days with you.""



The video ended abruptly.



A message followed: \[Wren, think your wedding's still happening on schedule?\]



My fingers went numb.



The trembling crawled from my fingertips through my entire body until even my teeth were chattering. The love I'd been so proud of, the man I'd trusted completely, had just delivered the truth in the cruelest possible way.



I forced myself to breathe to stay sane. I saved all the evidence and sent it to my best friend:



\[Rhett and I are done.\]



When I was sixteen, I caught my dad cheating with his secretary. When I confronted him through my tears, asking why he'd do this to us, he just threatened me not to tell my mom. He was so sure Mom would fall apart if she knew the truth.



I didn't believe him. I ran to my mother, crying as I told her about Dad's betrayal.



Later, my mom really did jump from our apartment balcony.



I never had a mother again.



That summer, I lost my mom and my dad. I became an outsider, shuffled between relatives who took me in out of obligation.



Rhett was the one who stayed with me through it all.



Rhett was the one who told me with absolute certainty:



""Wren, even if you lose everything else, you'll always have me.""



Now, Rhett—I don't have you anymore either.



I sat like a zombie in the coffee shop, watching my best friend point at the girl in the video and curse: ""This basic bitch isn't even that pretty! How the hell did she catch Rhett's eye? Remember when the actual school beauty was chasing him, and he wouldn't even look at her twice! How did he turn into this?""



My friend got more worked up as she ranted, finally slamming her hand on the table.



""I'm gonna find that bastard!""



""This is such bullshit!""



""That homewrecker basically moved in next door to mess with you—there's no way we're taking this lying down!""

**This book just delivered the most SHOCKING boss revelation and I'm stressed about the workplace tension 😱🔥**

Y'all, I thought I was getting simple office romance but this book said ""let me give you the most AWKWARD power dynamic ever"" and I am LIVING for this chaos!

**The premise:** Laura accidentally discovers her intimidating CEO boss Bryan Finch moonlighting as a masked stripper at an exclusive club. Now she's caught between keeping his secret and navigating their already tense workplace relationship where he's constantly threatening to fire her. The TENSION! 💀

**Why I'm completely FASCINATED:**

* Laura being the disaster employee who keeps making mistakes - RELATABLE CHAOS
* ""You've seen too much"" - the classic secret discovery trope with SPICE
* 89 chapters with 4.6 rating promising maximum workplace drama
* Bryan's mysterious double life as wealthy CEO AND stripper - WHY THOUGH?
* The power imbalance making everything more complicated
* Her spilling coffee on his desk AGAIN after their club encounter - MURPHY'S LAW

**What's sending me into ANTICIPATION MODE:**

* ""People like you...always clawing for an advantage"" - his classist assumptions
* The threat vs. protection dynamic of their ""deal""
* Her innocent curiosity vs. his dangerous secrets
* ""I'll be watching"" - the promise of intense surveillance
* Bryan's assumption she's trying to blackmail him - TRUST ISSUES
* The physical attraction neither can deny despite the circumstances

**The setup is PERFECTLY COMBUSTIBLE:**

* Struggling employee meets powerful boss with secrets
* Forbidden attraction in inappropriate circumstances
* Class differences creating misunderstandings
* Her financial desperation vs. his wealth and power
* The promise of him having to trust someone eventually
* Workplace enemies-to-lovers with a TWIST

Lilly really said ""let me write the most intense boss-employee secret dynamic"" and I'm HERE for Laura navigating this minefield!

**Rating: 4/5 stars** for addictive tension and unique premise ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Anyone else reading this? I NEED to know why Bryan strips and when their workplace hostility turns into something else. The forbidden romance potential is UNLIMITED! 😤

My building has an elevator and I'm on the 4th floor. I would pay for the help, the gas, any food/coffee along the way. Would prefer we do it in one straight shot. That's what we did before. It was a little rough but a cat nap here and there helped.

I'm a woman who pours her heart into everything, finds joy in laughter. God's grace has carried me through every season, and I'm so grateful for how it's shaped me.

I have long, dark, curly hair that naturally frames my face. And when I smile my two little dimples show slightly and I kind of have fair skin  but during summer it gets a little tan. 

 What truly makes my heart light up:
🏳️Peaceful dawn walks and precious quiet time in God's presence.
📸 The joy of photography, freezing special memories in time.
📚 Immersing myself in a compelling story or learning something new through reading.
🍿🎞️ Discovering new stories on screen during a relaxed movie or series marathon.
🎶 Listening to worship songs (hymns) that uplifts my spirit.
🏖️ Moments by the beach, feeling the sun and the sea breeze.

Faith is my cornerstone. As a committed Christian, I believe a relationship truly thrives when Christ is at its heart.

My ideal partner:
I dream of a man whose first love is God, who leads with quiet strength and humility, and who's committed to building a relationship with Christ at its very core. Open and honest communication is key, as is a gentle and kind heart. I'm excited to find someone who cherishes both joyful moments and spiritual growth, building a friendship brimming with encouragement, profound respect, and shared happiness.

What I bring to a relationship:
You can expect a woman who approaches life with purpose and grace, always striving to honor God in her actions. I offer genuine warmth, a willingness to communicate openly and honestly, and a desire to build a relationship rooted in mutual respect, unwavering support, and shared spiritual growth.

Long Distance: I'm open to seeing where a long-distance connection could lead, but consistency and clear intentions are important to me.

Relocation: Moving? Maybe! My heart (and prayer life) needs to be on board for that kind of adventure. So, if you're thinking of whisking me away, make sure God's on board first. No pressure, just divine intervention!

Age Range: Looking to connect with someone in the 28-35 age bracket. Old enough to be serious about faith, young enough to still enjoy a good meme. 😬😬

If you're someone who's also passionate about your walk with God, desires a relationship rooted in strong Christian principles, and is looking for a partner for life's adventures (big and small!), then let's chat.

Ready to step out in faith and see where God leads. Hopefully, it's somewhere with good coffee and even better company! 🙏💛

My inbox is open, and my faith is strong. Don't hesitate to say hi! God bless! 😊",2,1753026259.0,ChristianDating,1,1.0,False

Simply put: I love coffee, but it was destroying my sleep.

So I figured, okay, that’s what my second app should be. I decided to dive into Core ML and see if I could make a 'smarter' bedtime suggestion that actually acknowledges my coffee habit.

The result is Brew'd Awakening.

It’s a pretty straightforward app, but here’s what I tried to focus on:

• ⁠** A calculator that gets it:** This is the main thing. You tell it when you need to wake up, how much sleep you want, and roughly how much coffee you had. It uses a simple on-device model to give you a more realistic bedtime.
• ⁠** Completely private:** This was super important to me. There are no servers and no data collection. Everything happens on your phone and stays there.
• **The other stuff:** It also has a basic history tracker so you can see your patterns, a page with some sleep tips I found helpful, and light/dark themes. 

I have 20 promo codes for the ad-free version. I’d really appreciate any constructive feedback.

Why is everyone ‘just looking for friends’ here?,"Okay, I need to rant for a second and maybe someone here can help me make sense of this. I'm a guy, mid-20s, living in an Indian metro city, decently okay looking (not a troll), and I've been on dating apps for a while now - Tinder, Bumble, even Hinge once when I was feeling hopeful.

But bro... lately it feels like dating apps have turned into friendship apps. Like, I keep matching with women who are like: *“Hey, I’m just here for friends :)”*  
Cool. Then why are we on a DATING APP? This is literally the last place I want to get friend-zoned.

One woman even told me she sees me as someone she can “talk to about life” after 3 days of chatting. Ma’am, I already have a therapist I can't afford please don't become my second one.

It gets worse. I got catfished once by a woman who had no intention of dating. She was using the apps to make herself feel better about her breakup. She told me this *after* making me pay for filter coffee and listening to her ex drama for 45 minutes.

And then there's the one who actually cheated on me. We met on a dating app, dated for a bit, and then boom ghosted. Found out later she was also “vibing” with some other dude she’d matched with the same week - who was not surprisingly her guy best friend :))))

Anyway, all of this made me so frustrated that I turned it into a stand-up set and that's the only thing that really made me feel better about all this. ",1,1753026225.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

I started my Masonry journey at my current lodge, and have gotten to know the brethren there closely. I’ve also noticed some friction between some if the brothers that doesn’t seem to be healing. The WM often makes remarks that offends others. This friction is ongoing, and if the lodge isn’t united, I don’t see us bringing unity outside of the lodge in the world. While the WM has never said anything negative to me, it still hurts me to see the light wane in my beloved brothers’ eyes. My candidate coach started associating with another nearby lodge and spends more of his time there now, due to this friction.

I love this lodge, but unfortunately I will be moving from California to Florida in about 1 month. Before I leave, I’ll likely pass my FC proficiency and be raised to a MM, and I’ve been thinking of speaking up that night after the ritual when the lodge is open to MM for a meeting (not sure if I said that correctly), and I was wondering if saying the following would be appropriate, as it’s my first time speaking in a meeting.

Essentially, I want to tell the Brethren that no matter how long or how little we’ve been a Mason, how many or how few chairs we’ve had, to be ever in search of the light. I wanted to remind them that change starts from within and then within our Brethren, and only then, in the world. United we stand, divided we don’t stand a chance in hell. To look at the relationship we have with each one of our brothers, and ask ourselves if it’s where we’d like it to be, and that I hope regardless of how strong our relationships may or may not be, i hope the strongest days are ahead of us all. And the beautiful thing is that we don’t have to hope, we can act now and create that. And finally, I will suggest to the WM maybe the lodge can create a system where brothers enter their name into a list, that randomly pairs two brothers once a month to get a lunch or coffee.

That’s more or less the message I want to relay, I still have some weeks to find the right wording, but first I wanted to get some insight if this would be appropriate to bring up at all. Thanks for reading.

I'm a guy, mid-20s, living in an Indian metro city, decently okay looking (not a troll), and I've been on dating apps for a while now - Tinder, Bumble, even Hinge once when I was feeling hopeful.

But bro... lately it feels like dating apps have turned into friendship apps. Like, I keep matching with women who are like: *“Hey, I’m just here for friends :)”*  
Cool. Then why are we on a DATING APP? This is literally the last place I want to get friend-zoned.

One woman even told me she sees me as someone she can “talk to about life” after 3 days of chatting. Ma’am, I already have a therapist I can't afford please don't become my second one.

It gets worse. I got catfished once by a woman who had no intention of dating. She was using the apps to make herself feel better about her breakup. She told me this *after* making me pay for filter coffee and listening to her ex drama for 45 minutes.

And then there's the one who actually cheated on me. We met on a dating app, dated for a bit, and then boom ghosted. Found out later she was also “vibing” with some other dude she’d matched with the same week - who was not surprisingly her guy best friend :))))

Anyway, all of this made me so frustrated that I turned it into a stand-up set. Now, I finally feel like a huge weight has been lifted off my shoulders since I got it off my chest. ",0,1753026026.0,Bumble,1,0.5,False

1m4rycu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1m4rycu/discover_the_paris_hilton_french_press_review/,Discover the Paris Hilton French Press Review Does It Redefine Coffee Style?,"The **Paris Hilton Paris Hilton French Press Coffee Maker** initially grabbed my attention due to its striking aesthetic and its promise of functionality. As someone who appreciates both design and efficiency, I saw this product as an intriguing addition to my kitchen. Over the course of using it, I experimented with its features and performance, aiming to see if the hype held true. Here’s my experience with this unique coffee press:

**Design and Style**  
The first thing anyone notices about this coffee maker is its unapologetically pink and gold design. The glass carafe framed in golden stainless steel with heart accents is beyond chic—it feels like it was made to be the centerpiece of a countertop. Even my friends, who normally don't care about kitchen gadgets, kept commenting on its appearance! Measuring approximately 7x7x8.5 inches, it’s compact enough to fit neatly into any space without dominating your counter. In a sea of generic coffee presses, this one stands out and genuinely feels like a part of my kitchen decor rather than just utilitarian equipment.

**Ease of Use**  
Simple and intuitive, this coffee press is a breeze to operate. Even though I’ve tried several French presses before, this one excels at making the process almost foolproof. With the included heart-shaped measuring scoop, you add ground coffee, pour in hot water, wait four minutes, press gently, and voilà—perfectly brewed coffee in no time. There’s something satisfying about the way the plunger moves smoothly without resistance. The handle stays cool even when the press is full of hot liquid, which makes pouring worry-free.

[Looking for Paris Hilton Paris Hilton deals on Amazon now.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b0b2l1zwjf/)

**Durability and Safety Features**  
One thing I was initially skeptical about was the glass carafe. From previous experience, products with thin glass can feel fragile, but this one uses temperature-safe glass that has held up well so far. I tested it with both boiling water and warm liquids, and the carafe didn’t show any signs of cracking or breakdown. The golden stainless steel frame provides extra support, giving it a solid, secure feel during use. The fine-mesh stainless-steel filter is another highlight, as it effectively keeps coffee grounds out of the final pour. 

**Capacity and Usability**  
This French press can handle up to 34 ounces, equating to roughly 8 cups depending on your serving size. When hosting brunch, the capacity was sufficient for several cups of coffee for everyone at the table. Transforming it into a tea press worked just as well when I made loose-leaf tea for the family; it brewed as evenly and efficiently as it did coffee. Additionally, the non-drip spout is a thoughtful design feature—no messy spills while pouring! 

**Highlights**  
- The stylish pink and gold design adds flair to any kitchen.  
- The cool-touch handle ensures safe pouring, even with hot liquids.  
- A reusable, fine-mesh filter keeps coffee grounds and tea leaves contained.  
- Works perfectly for both coffee and loose-leaf tea brewing.  

**Areas of Improvement**  
Despite all the positives, there are a few limitations. For one, cleaning the mesh filter requires a bit of patience. Although the filter performs well, dislodging tiny particles post-brew can feel slightly tedious. Additionally, while the gold frame is gorgeous, a little extra weight would’ve given it an even sturdier feel. Lastly, if you like your coffee piping hot, you may find that the glass loses heat faster than some insulated alternatives.  

- Cleaning the fine-mesh filter takes extra time.  
- Glass carafe could retain heat longer.  
- The gold frame, while sturdy, feels slightly light.  

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this coffee press to others like the Bodum Chambord or Mueller’s double-insulated French press showcases its strengths and weaknesses. The Chambord is more minimalistic in design but lacks the unique charm and aesthetic of the Paris Hilton press. On the other hand, the double-walled stainless steel Mueller press stands out for keeping coffee hotter for extended periods, but it sacrifices the style factor that Paris Hilton’s product clearly prioritizes. If you're someone who values visual appeal just as much as utility, this coffee maker edges out most competitors in charm and Instagram-worthiness.

**Price Worthiness**  
Given the features and design of this product, it lands solidly in the category of affordable quality. While you can find budget French presses, they often cut corners in design or build quality. The combination of a temperature-safe carafe, cool-touch handle, and reusable filter makes this press solidly worth its price point for what it offers. It would make for an excellent gift or an equally delightful treat for yourself if you enjoy starting the day with brewed perfection that doesn’t compromise style.

I did awful works. Atrocities.  But I thought, if I looked up high enough, to promote myself to positions where people looked unto those things I aspired to be as good, that meant, just by me and what I did, I could *""compensate for the faults and bad aspects of me""* by just sit alone; with myself and ""look unto"" learn something that is good, would compensate for all the rotten things I did.

Then, I found in the Bible in Psalm 14:1-3  this  ""...filthy; done abominable works...""  but I didn't hide behind this when it said  ""there is none that doeth good; no, not one""  - I saw it was me, and my sins I did that condemned.  So, I didn't have to look at what you do or did, it was me and my works that condemned me. That I used the Ten Commandments WRONG.  I just followed what the church told me; and, if I would follow and do them, I'd be good, even if I went up to bat and struck out 593,409,231,864,799 times...I was still trying so I was doing the Ten Commandments.  At least I did one of them, one time right. That means, it compensated for all the ones I BROKE, everytime I broke them.

When God, even from when he spoke them in Exodus 20, spoke them to make ALL ISRAEL, even Moses GUILTY before him.  It worked.  They begged Moses to go on up on the mountain and ask God to stop talking, while Moses' knees quaked.

Where everyone of each came with a DEATH sentence.  So, if you broke one, one time, they are all broken.

NOBODY did the Ten Commandments; they're BROKEN.  Psalm 51:5 says ""Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and *in sin did my mother conceive me*.""  It's God in Jesus Christ DID the Ten Commandments; and, because he DID them, everywhere, where I did not do them, he made himself the compensation for that, because he did them.  Took my sins off me and laid them on Jesus Christ on the cross; crucified. His blood shed. That God looks on this work he did as greater than my sins I did. Greater than the sins of the whole world. Nailed the Ten Commandments to his cross.  Bequeathed his righteousness to me.  I did not regard this work.  I thought I had to do the work.

And I just thought that was ""born"" but nope. That's when mommy and daddy were dating, and couldn't stand it anymore at the drive in movie, and steamed all the windows up, and I was the prodigy of it.  I was conceived in the Ten Commandments BROKE.  And that's how God wants the WHOLE WORLD to see it. Where their jaw just drops open - it makes me GUILTY before God.  I know. I'm GUILTY.

It's in this that I fell on my face.  It's in this that I saw what Jesus said to the Pharisees in Matthew 22:41-46

""*While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say unto him, The son of David.He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying,The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool?If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?And no man was able to answer him a word...""*

That, in Genesis 12:3  ..who is God talking to, Abraham or to this seed of Isaiah 9:6-7..  ""*And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed.""*

*Then, he put him in every family on earth.  Unto me a child is born. Unto me a son is given.  Did the same in your family. Put the same son in yours, and did this in every family on earth..  To be my ""kinsmen's redeemer"" - to redeem me; that is, he would be Isaiah 44:24  what ""redeem"" means  <to compensate for the fault and bad aspects of me> did that for everybody over the whole earth.*

Sowed his seed into the field, and the whole field is the earth.  Isaiah 9:6-7 says

*""For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the Lord of hosts will perform this.""*

*If you bless him, look what God does...man, over coffee, I already fell on my cup. He is who he says he is.*

*People don't know what to do with him; but if God put him in your family... ..he's your relative; kin.  Look who he is. EVERYBODY has a family by this. Not one person can say ""I have no family"" by what God did.*

Alright, here’s the deal.  
If you’re Googling *“proofreading service near me urgent”* — chances are you’ve got a paper, document, or something important that needs to be checked *right now*.

Maybe it’s your final thesis.  
Maybe it’s a job application.  
Maybe you promised your boss it’d be perfect... and well... it isn’t.

I’m not here to judge.  
I’m here to fix it. Fast.

I run a **real human proofreading service** that’s made for people who are out of time, out of patience, and not in the mood for some AI bot or $500/hour editing “agency.”  
None of that fluff.

Here’s how it works:

You email me your file.  
I read it. Line by line.  
I fix the stuff that makes you look sloppy — spelling, grammar, clarity, tone, structure.  
If your writing sounds stiff, I smooth it out.  
If your sentences are a bit of a mess (no shame), I clean them up — without changing your meaning.

You get it back clean, clear, and ready to go.

**Turnaround?**  
I can usually do it in **24 hours or less**.  
Yes, even for big documents. If it's a thesis or dissertation, I’ll move fast without rushing the quality.  
If it's a 3-page email to your CEO? I’ll have it back before your next coffee break.

**And no, you don’t need to live near me.**  
""Proofreading service near me"" just means you want someone who feels local.  
Someone who *gets it* and won’t ghost you or send your doc back full of question marks and automated garbage.

I’m one person. I care about what I send back.  
This isn’t Fiverr. This isn’t Grammarly.  
This is *actual proofreading by someone who knows the difference between there, their, and they’re.*

# Who I help:

* Students on tight deadlines
* Non-native English speakers who want to sound fluent
* Business owners who want to look smart without trying too hard
* Anyone who wants to avoid looking careless

# What I don’t do:

❌ Rewriting your whole paper  
❌ Pretending to be an academic editor  
❌ Charging hidden fees  
❌ Making you wait 3 days for a 2-hour job

**My rate?**  
Simple and fair. Not the cheapest, not the most expensive. But 100% worth it if you want to look sharp.

I have highlighted the easy ones *with stars* and would really appreciate if people could identify these for me. I will add to the list as place names come in, I think I have a couple already but if people wouldn't mind checking that would be fab. Then depending on how bored you are please have a go at the others, I'd love to get as many as we can but appreciate that most people do actually have lives and won't spend ages on this like I will!

I popped in one from my high school days, hoping to recapture some of those 'simpler times' vibes. Anyway, this one song came on—one I hadn't heard in years—and it totally took me back. It smelled like teen spirit, but in the most ordinary way possible. 😊

The weirdest thing happened, tho... As I listened, I realized the lyrics were all about patience—something I kinda struggle with these days. Waiting for things to happen, whether it's career stuff or even small things like waiting for my coffee to brew, drives me up the wall sometimes.

But as the song played, I started to think differently. Like, maybe patience is just about enjoying the moments in between what's happening next. I mean, life is kinda just a series of those 'in-betweens', right? Taking a moment to appreciate that made me feel a bit lighter, idk.

Anywho, just wanted to share. Anyone else ever have a forgotten song smack them in the face with a life lesson?",9,1753025533.0,snapinsight,0,1.0,False

The 2025 Boone County Ham Breakfast and Ham Show began with a traditional ham breakfast served around 8 a.m. on long tables with plenty of coffee and orange juice. Afterward, the auctioning began at a rapid-fire pace.

The top 44 hams from this year’s submissions were auctioned off around 9 a.m. in both the Youth Ham Show Division and the Open Ham Show Division.

This year, the highest bid ham went for $3,000, the seller being 6-year-old Lucas Barnes and his family.

“It means a lot; (I’m) shocked that it went for that much, never expected that,” said Belinda Barnes, Lucas’ mother. “Probably going to put the money in his scholarship fund.”

None of the other hams sold during the auction came close to that mark.

Elaine George, chair of the ham breakfast and auction, said 142 hams in total were submitted this year.

“A lot of fairs have smoked hams, but we do not do smoked hams,” George said. “We do the original sugar-cured ham.”

The ham auction has been a long-standing tradition for the past 80 years.

“We’re trying to keep it going,” George said of the auction. “It’s just kind of (a) dying art of curing ham.”

1m4rlqq,https://www.reddit.com/r/AeroPress/comments/1m4rlqq/pushing_beyond_the_hiss_with_flow_control_cap/,Pushing beyond the hiss with flow control cap,"I understand there is some division regarding whether or not you should push the plunger all the way down after all the liquid has gone out and you're just left with the air bubbles aka the hiss. Official instructions tell you to do it, while some coffee creators tell you not to.

Well, I recently got a flow control cap (the new version, no leaks!) and I realised that the hiss is not so much a hiss but a long, wet fart. Other than the funny sound, this raises a question: is pushing beyond the hiss/fart harmful for the valve in the flow control cap? Should I keep pushing fully as per instructions, or should I stop plunging as soon as I hear sound? I'm afraid prolonged uh farting may create some fatigue on the valve.

This all sounds like a silly post but it's a genuine question.

Also, while I have your attention, I also got a metal filter. My intention is to keep using a paper filter but having the metal filter as an extra barrier since there's a tendency for the paper to cling to the flow control cap and you don't get a fully formed puck at the end. Could this be a problem vis a Vis creating added resistance?",2,1753025043.0,AeroPress,0,1.0,False

I don’t like the small town I live in but I caregive for my parents - one of whom has developed some serious health issues this year- so moving is not an option.  also a social anxiety type introvert so joining a group has its own challenges.  

 last time I felt healthy was 2 years ago- had saved money and went to Europe for 3 months.  hiking and wondering ruins and museums was hard at first but by the end I was in my feet and walking from morning until late at night, actually eating fairly decent and was stronger then I felt in years.  and I lost 50lbs… I was down to 244.  walking all day didn’t wind me like it did at the start, and large hills and towns with uneven steps (109 from where my room was down to the restaurant and water area in one coastal Italian town) didn’t faze me.  the sun and sea water all contributed to where I felt better then I had in years.  but that was not something I can repeat due to $$$, so time to make changes at home.

came home and the day to day routine just gave me zero motivation, depression set it and two years later- while I did go back up to 298lbs, I am now down to 271lbs with diet changes, I need to start doing more.  on top of caregiving I started a stressful toxic job in April and given the insanity of it, the daily pressure on my chest, no at 170/110, and the anxiety, I need to make changes now.  saw a doctor, took some time off, and we discussed a few things- I am eating ok, -we are a cooking family- so vegetables and protein every evening-but need to drop breads and sugar (coffee, soda only time I use), daily exercise and keep a regular sleep schedule.

normally when I have started at the gym (which I am starting tomorrow), I head straight to cardio.  I have asthma but a few preventative shots before I start tend to not make that an issue.  I am also focusing on sleeping, and have started baths and controlled breathing (helped in past for the anxiety).  cannot walk outside as we are covered in forest fire smoke (see asthma), so gym is my option.

i am here as I am trying to find a routine to do.  most times I wander the gym and while the treadmill will assist with getting me to the point where I can hold me own in a gym, I just fumble around the rest, trying to find the right exercises to do.  my focus is back strength - as that is usually what I hurt when I start this routine- legs just need firming up and have an ok idea what to do there.  mostly mimic others for chest and arms.

any place I can find a good beginners workout?  not looking for supplements, and would prefer not to spend money on apps unless I talk to others that use them.  any you tubers for overweight men in 50s trying to slim down. help?

October: 215lbs, started intermittent fasting. Mostly not eating from 3pm to 8am (17h fast). Wasnt eating a lot of junk, but eating whatever I liked. Minimal exercise.

3 months in: 205lbs (10lbs loss), then stagnated until 6m mark

6 months in: 203lbs (2lbs loss): In March, started tracking macros, targetting high proteins (150g), low carbs (200g) and low fat (70g), total 2000 calories. Started exercising more, running 3 times per week, biking once or twice, and averaging 15k steps even on non running days. Went on 3h hike every other weekend. I would target 2000 cal on days where I exercise, and 1400 to 1600 when I didnt. This would create a deficit of 600 to 800 calories per day, sometimes a bit more.

8 months in: 183lbs (20lbs loss, 10lbs per month). On top of fat loss, body started to reshape, muscles slightly toned. Started more intense triathlon training, so would end up with 600 zone minutes per week, can do 20m biking on a given day, with 3m running and .75 mile swimming. 

9 months in (today): 177lbs (6lbs loss). Muscles have started really showing. Still got small love handles but shoulders and midriff look much more athletic.

Other metrics:
- cholesterol went from 275 (pretty high) to 190 (which is acceptable) in last 4 months. Triglycerides from 150 to 75. My doctor was impressed.
- Testosterone was around 190 (acceptable range is 180 to 800), now its 400, which is pretty high for men my age.
- Went from 32% body fat to 24%. Targetting 20%


My takeaways:

- I did other diets in the past, but this one is by far the most rigorous and healthy. I am super mindful of what I eat. I eat a lot of things I really love (smoked salmon, chicken, keto bread, cottage, milky drinks like muscle milk, beans, avocado, fruits), and I am never hungry. I do miss stuff like pancakes, fries or super sweet boba teas, but ill have them maybe once a month, and I dont feel frustrated about it. I eat to feed my body, not to feed my brain, i.e. carbs before exercise, proteins after.
- i thought that dieting would be much harder than in the past. It may have been at the beginning, but now I feel much more in control than I ever felt in previous diets.
- exercise is key. When you exercise, it really pays off to see your body look better, and it incentivizes you to not screw it up by eating garbage. Also, the more you exercise, the more energy you have, and the easier it becomes to exercise. My gf and I now wake up at 7am on weekends to go run for nearly an hour, after which we have a nice breakfast at a coffee place. Great bonding moment.
- the scale doesnt tell the whole picture. My body looks better now than when I was in my twenties, even though I was probably 15lbs lighter. I am now way more muscular and so targetting the weight I had back then may not make much sense.

# Best Earbuds for Small Ear Canals 2025: Top Picks

Finding earbuds that fit comfortably and securely in small ear canals can be a frustrating endeavor. many standard earbuds are simply too large,leading to discomfort,a poor seal,and a tendency to fall out. This article aims to guide you thru the best earbuds designed specifically for smaller ears, ensuring a agreeable, enjoyable listening experience in 2025.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the right earbuds for small ear canals requires careful consideration of several key features.

**Ergonomic Design:**
the shape and contours of the earbud are crucial for a secure and comfortable fit in small ears. Earbuds with a shallower design or those that rely less on wedging into the ear canal often work best. Many manufacturers are now incorporating data from extensive ear shape studies to create more ergonomic designs that accommodate a wider range of ear sizes, including smaller ones. The curvature of the earbud housing plays a significant role in how well it sits in the concha, the outer part of the ear, providing additional support and stability.

**Variety of Ear Tip Sizes:**
The availability of multiple ear tip sizes, especially smaller sizes like extra-small (XS) and small (S), is essential. The ear tips are the direct interface with your ear canal.Having a range of sizes lets you select the one that achieves the most secure and comfortable fit without causing pressure or discomfort. Look for earbuds that come with at least four ear tip sizes. Premium options may even include foam ear tips, which conform to the shape of your ear canal for a more customized fit and better noise isolation.

**lightweight Construction:**
Weight is a critical factor, especially when wearing earbuds for extended periods. Heavier earbuds can exert extra pressure on the ear canal, leading to discomfort. Lighter earbuds tend to stay in place better and cause less fatigue.Materials like lightweight plastics and aluminum alloys are often used to minimize weight without sacrificing durability. The overall design should distribute the weight evenly to prevent any single point from bearing too much pressure.

**Wireless Connectivity and Codecs:**
Most modern earbuds offer Bluetooth connectivity. The Bluetooth version (e.g., Bluetooth 5.3 or later) impacts connection stability, range, and power consumption. Support for advanced audio codecs, such as aptX Adaptive, LDAC, or AAC when using Apple (some proprietary codec), ensures high-quality audio transmission. these codecs optimize the data transfer between the earbuds and your device, reducing latency and preserving audio detail. Make sure the earbuds support the codecs compatible with your smartphone or audio source for the best listening experience.**IP Rating for Water Resistance:**
An IP (Ingress Protection) rating is vital if you plan to use your earbuds for workouts or in environments where they might be exposed to sweat or rain. An IPX4 rating means the earbuds are splash-resistant, while IPX7 or higher indicates they can withstand submersion in water for a short period. This protects the internal components from damage,extending the lifespan of your earbuds.

**Touch Controls and Customization:**
Convenient touch controls allow you to manage music playback, adjust the volume, answer calls, and activate voice assistants with simple gestures.Customizable controls, frequently enough available through a companion app, let you assign specific functions to different gestures, tailoring the user experience to your preferences. This adds convenience and reduces the need to reach for your phone.

## Core Benefits

The right earbuds designed for small ear canals offer several key benefits that substantially enhance the listening experience.

**Enhanced Comfort:** The primary benefit is the improved comfort. Standard earbuds often press uncomfortably against the ear canal or concha, causing pain and discomfort, especially during longer listening sessions. Properly fitting earbuds eliminate this discomfort, allowing you to enjoy music, podcasts, or audiobooks without irritation. This is crucial for daily commutes,workouts,or extended periods of focus.

**Secure Fit and Stability:** Earbuds designed for small ears are less likely to fall out during physical activity. A secure fit ensures that the earbuds stay in place even during vigorous movements, such as running, jumping, or dancing.this reduces distractions and allows you to concentrate on your workout or activity without constantly readjusting your earbuds.A stable fit also contributes to better sound quality by maintaining a consistent distance between the drivers and your eardrums.

**Improved Noise Isolation:** A proper seal between the earbud and your ear canal is essential for effective noise isolation. Well-fitting earbuds passively block out ambient noise, reducing distractions and allowing you to hear your music or audio content more clearly. This is particularly beneficial in noisy environments like public transportation, busy offices, or crowded streets. Some earbuds also feature active noise cancellation (ANC) technology, which further reduces external noise.

**Better Sound Quality:** When earbuds fit properly,they deliver sound more effectively. A secure seal ensures that the full frequency range is transmitted accurately, resulting in richer bass, clearer mids, and crisp highs. This enhances the overall listening experience, allowing you to appreciate the nuances of your favorite music and podcasts. Poorly fitting earbuds often leak sound, resulting in a thin, tinny sound quality.

**Longer Listening Sessions:** Comfort and stability directly contribute to longer, more enjoyable listening sessions. When earbuds are comfortable and secure, you can wear them for hours without experiencing discomfort or fatigue. This is especially significant for travelers, remote workers, and anyone who relies on earbuds for extended periods throughout the day.

## FAQs Section

**How do i know if my Earbuds are the right size?**
You'll know if your earbuds are the right size if they feel comfortable and secure in your ears. They should not cause any pain or pressure, and they should stay in place even when you move your head or engage in light physical activity. You should also experience good sound isolation, meaning that ambient noise is reduced. If the earbuds feel loose, fall out easily, or sound tinny, they are likely too small. If they feel tight, cause pain, or create a suction effect, they are likely too large. experiment with different ear tip sizes to find the best fit. Many manufacturers provide size guides and recommendations.

**Can I use regular-sized earbuds if I have small ear canals?**
While it's possible to use regular-sized earbuds, doing so may result in discomfort, a poor seal, and a tendency for the earbuds to fall out. Regular-sized earbuds are designed for average to larger ear canal sizes, so they may not fit securely or comfortably in smaller ears.This can lead to a less than optimal listening experience and potential ear fatigue. It's generally recommended to choose earbuds specifically designed for smaller ear canals to ensure a comfortable and secure fit.

**Are there any specific materials I should look for in earbuds for sensitive ears?**
Yes, if you have sensitive ears, look for earbuds made from hypoallergenic materials such as silicone or memory foam. These materials are less likely to cause irritation or allergic reactions. Avoid earbuds made from hard plastics or those with nickel-plated components, as these can sometimes trigger sensitivity. Cleaning your earbuds regularly with a mild, non-abrasive cleaner is also essential to prevent the build-up of bacteria and debris, which can contribute to irritation.

**Do I need to spend a lot of money to get good earbuds for small ear canals?**
No, you don't necessarily need to spend a lot of money to get good earbuds for small ear canals. While premium earbuds often offer advanced features and superior sound quality, there are many affordable options available that prioritize comfort and fit.Focus on finding earbuds with a variety of ear tip sizes, a lightweight design, and good reviews from users with small ears.

It leaks out the bottom, even during a cleaning or descaling cycle.  With cleaning/descaling cycles it auto shuts off after 5 seconds because of the leak and it can't keep the water pressure going.

I've taken it apart and found where the leak is coming from but I can't seem to take it apart enough to actually solve the issue.  I'm pretty handy with fixing stuff like this so Id love to fix this and take the unit to work, but I know if I can't fix it I will have to toss it.  With a new Pixie being delivered later next week to keep my caffeine flowing (currently borrowing a neighbor's Vertuo for the week until that arrives haha), it's not life or death to fix it.  But I would really love to given that I've disassembled it this far.

The leak is coming from underneath the metal motor part.  I can watch it overflowing with water and then it trickles down the front side in the little channel that appears to be built specifically for this leak 😬.  When I take the top part off I can slowly pour water into the centrifugal area where the coffee pod is and all the water comes through and out the spout like it should - no leak.  But when it spins or heats up the water it overflows and trickles down and shuts off.

If you have had this issue before I'd love some suggestions on how to fix.  Im not looking for advice on whether or not to toss it - I know leaks on these machines is pretty common.",2,1753024842.0,nespresso,0,1.0,False
1m4ripq,https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaGoPlaces/comments/1m4ripq/how_do_i_get_to_carmel_by_the_sea/,How do I get to Carmel by the Sea?,"Just got back from an incredible day trip to Carmel by the Sea, and I wanted to share my experience since I see this question come up often. After trying different options, I found what I think is the best way to get there, especially if you're starting from San Francisco.

While you can drive yourself, I discovered that taking a guided tour actually saves you both stress and money when you factor in gas, parking fees, and entrance costs. Plus, you get to relax and enjoy the scenery instead of navigating traffic.

I recently took this full-day tour (https://athometouch.com/Monterey) that covers not just Carmel, but also Monterey and the famous 17-Mile Drive. It was honestly the highlight of my California trip.

The journey starts early in San Francisco, but it's worth it. Our first stop was the Pigeon Point Lighthouse - imagine the tallest lighthouse on the West Coast with waves crashing below. Perfect for those morning photos.

The route to Carmel is stunning. We drove along the Pacific Coast Highway, stopping at places I would've missed if driving alone. There's this great coffee spot in Davenport where we took a break - the views there are incredible.

In Monterey, we had two hours to explore Cannery Row. Some people in our group visited the aquarium (bring extra cash if you want to do this), while I checked out the local shops and had some amazing clam chowder.

The 17-Mile Drive was mind-blowing. We saw the famous Lone Cypress, Bird Rock covered in seals, and even stopped at Pebble Beach Golf Links. Our guide shared fascinating stories about the area's history that you won't find in guidebooks.

When we finally reached Carmel, it felt magical. The architecture looks like something from a fairy tale. We had time to explore the town, and I found some unique shops in Carmel Plaza. The beach here is absolutely pristine.

Here's what made this tour worth it:
- No parking hassles (seriously, parking in Carmel can be tough)
- All entrance fees included (17-Mile Drive alone is $11.25 per car)
- Comfortable transportation (air-conditioned coach)
- Expert guide who knew all the hidden spots
- Perfect photo opportunities at all the right places

If you're planning to visit, I'd strongly recommend booking the tour I took (https://athometouch.com/Monterey). It's currently discounted to $129.27 per person, which is actually a great deal considering everything that's included.

Pro tip: Bring layers! The coast can get chilly even on sunny days. Also, pack some snacks and water - you'll want them between stops.

The tour ends back in San Francisco around 6:30 PM, making it a full but incredibly memorable day. It's definitely the most convenient way to experience Carmel by the Sea, especially if you're short on time or don't want to deal with rental cars and navigation.

Let me know if you have any questions about the tour or Carmel in general. I'm happy to share more details about my experience!",1,1753024835.0,WannaGoPlaces,0,1.0,False

I’m 28 and from the UK. Like a lot of us on here, looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



Love storytelling in all its forms, but especially reading. Escaping into another world, yes please. Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you’re feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you’ve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I keep telling myself I’ll get back to my other love, history, but so far it’s mostly the band Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I’m seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it’s in a slightly unconventional way. If you’re into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I’d definitely recommend them.



I’ve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I’m deep in the running cult. I’m not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I’m definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after are all part of the running experience I happily subscribe to.



As a self-confessed member of the totally not running cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. Which one are you part of? 🤣



Now that I’ve rambled like I’m surviving on very little sleep and too much caffeine, (cough cough,) both true, it’s only fair you tell me about yourself. What’s your thing? What’s the hobby or obsession you’d like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between. I’m into tangents, chats that spiral in the best way, and before you know it, we've landed somewhere unexpectedly lovely. Basically, the kind of connection that actually feels like something worth seeing through, and hopefully along the way, sparks fly and find us.



Got a book that’ll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn’t involve buying yet another pair of shoes? I’m listening.



If you made it all the way down here, clearly we both have commitment and stamina. Promising start. ☺️❤️",0,1753024558.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

**Material Durability**

The durability of the materials used is paramount for any outdoor furniture set. High-quality sets often feature weather-resistant materials like aluminum, teak, resin wicker, or powder-coated steel. These materials are designed to withstand exposure to the elements, including sun, rain, and temperature fluctuations. The robustness of the frame and the resilience of the seating surfaces ensure that the set maintains its structural integrity and aesthetic appeal over time. Teak, for example, is naturally resistant to rot and insects, while aluminum offers rustproof properties.

Easy-to-clean surfaces, removable cushion covers, and rustproof hardware contribute to long-term convenience.

## FAQs Section

**What is the best material for a round garden table and chairs set to withstand harsh weather?**
Teak and aluminum are excellent choices for outdoor furniture that needs to withstand harsh weather conditions. Teak is naturally resistant to rot, insects, and moisture, making it ideal for humid climates. Aluminum is lightweight, rustproof, and can withstand extreme temperatures. Both materials require minimal maintenance and can last for many years with proper care.

**How do I determine the right size table for my patio or deck?**
Measure your patio or deck area and consider the amount of space you want to dedicate to the table and chairs. A good rule of thumb is to leave at least three feet of unobstructed space around the table for comfortable movement. If you frequently entertain large groups,opt for a larger table. If you prefer a more intimate setting, a smaller table will suffice.

**Can I leave my round garden table and chairs set outside during the winter?**
While many outdoor furniture sets are designed to withstand moderate weather conditions, it's best to protect them during the winter months.Store the furniture in a shed, garage, or covered area to prevent damage from snow, ice, and extreme cold.

It was from Captain Low that I learned the secret to life. The single most important rule, he’d told me, the rule that had kept his head above water these many years in His Majesty’s service: Be a good marine. 

“It’s the most natural of instincts,” he said. “Because the King created the Royal Marines, and we are the King’s subjects.” He stalked back and forth as he spoke, ducking the crossbeams overhead, then paused and swung his piercing eyes on me. “Why are you a marine, Corporal Gideon?” 

Staring as straight and blankly as I could, willing my eyes to see not just into but through the bulkhead to the expanse of sea beyond it, I considered mentioning the ruthless plantation in Georgia, and my enlistment in British service as a means of freedom from American slavery. I could mention Abigail, and what my master did to her the day before I escaped. 

But with Private Teale – another freed slave diversifying HMS Commerce’s otherwise white complement of marines – at attention beside me, and the cynical black ship’s surgeon within earshot through the wardroom door, Captain Low was in no mood for a lecture on African Diaspora. 

“Because the King made me one, sir.” I spoke strongly enough, but my words lacked conviction, and the captain glared, while the doctor’s facetious cough carried through the door.

“A marine,” said Low, unphased and carrying on with his uniform inspection, the frequent ducking of his lanky frame, while keeping his severe but not unkind expression fixed on me, “always knows what is required by asking himself: What would a good marine do, right now, in this circumstance? In all circumstance?”

Inspecting Private Teale, Low’s own instincts proved themselves with the immediate discovery of missing pipeclay on the back of his crossbelt, and he dismissed Teale without a word. Still addressing me he said, “I understand you began your service with Lord Cochrane’s outfit on Tangier. And that he personally raised you to corporal at the Chesapeake.” 

“Aye, sir.” 

“Thomas Cochrane is a particular friend of mine. He's built a reputation training good fighting marines. Could be he saw something in you…but even decorated war heroes make mistakes.” 

Six bells rang on the quarterdeck. All hands called aft; the bosun’s pipe shrilled out and above our heads came the sound of many running bare feet. But I stayed rooted in place, unable to move while Captain Low held me in an awkward silence, an awkwardness he seemed to enjoy, even encourage with his marginally perplexed eyebrows.

Finally, he said, “What say you move along to your fucking post, Corporal?” 

“Aye, sir,” I said, saluting with relief, slinging my musket and hurtling up the ladder through the hatch and onto the main deck of the Commerce. 

The sunset blazed crimson, the sea turning a curious wine-color in response, and silhouetted on the western swells the reason for our hastily assembled uniform inspection was coming across on a barge from the flag ship, the Achilles: Rear Admiral John Warren. I joined my fellow marines at the rail, Teale among them in a double-clayed crossbelt, fiddling with his gloves. 

When the Admiral came aboard we were in our places, a line of splendid scarlet coats, ramrod straight, and we presented arms with a rhythmic stamp and clash that would have rivaled the much larger contingent of marines aboard the flagship. 

Captain Low’s stoic expression cracked for the briefest of moments; it was clear he found our presentation of drill extremely satisfying, and he knew the flagship’s marine officer heard our thunder even across 500 yards of chopping sea. Colonel Woolcomb would now be extolling his ship’s marines to wipe the Commerce’s eye with their own deafening boot and musket strike upon the Admiral’s return.

But before Low could resume his stoic expression, and before we’d finished inwardly congratulating ourselves, the proud gleam in his eyes took on a smoke- tinged fury. Teale’s massive black thumb was sticking out from a tear in the white glove holding his musket.

With the sun at our backs this egregious breach of centuries-long Naval custom was hardly visible to the quarterdeck, much less so as Captain Chevers and the Navy officers were wholly taken up with ushering the Admiral into the dining cabin for toasted cheese and Madeira, or beefsteak if that didn’t suit, or perhaps his Lordship preferred the lighter dish of pan-buttered anchovies—but a tremble passed through our rank, and nearby seamen in their much looser formations nudged each other and grinned, plainly enjoying our terror. 

For every foremast jack aboard felt the shadow cast by Captain Low’s infinite incredulity; he stared aghast at the thumb as if a torn glove was some new terror the marines had never encountered in their illustrious history. 

I silently willed Teale to keep his gaze like mine, expressionless and farsighted on the line of purple horizon, unthinking and deaf to all but lawful orders, like a good marine. 

At dinner that evening, a splendid dinner in which the leftover anchovies and half-filled Madeira bottles were shared out, the consensus of the lower deck hands was that Private Teale would certainly be court-martialed and executed by the next turn of the glass. 

Ronald West, Carpenters Mate, had it from a midshipman who overheard Captain Low assert that the issue was no longer whether to execute Private Teale, but whether he was to be hung by the bowsprit or the topgallant crosstrees. At the same juncture Barrett Harding, focs’l hand, had it from the gunner that the wardroom was discussing the number of prescribed lashes, not in tens or hundreds but thousands. 

“Never seen a man bear up to a thousand on the grating,” said Harding, with a grave shake of his head. The younger ship’s boys stared in open-mouthed horror at his words. “A hundred, sure. I took 4 dozen on the Tulon blockade and none the worse. But this here flogging tomorrow? His blood will right pour out the scuppers!” 

But the Admiral’s orders left little time for punishment, real or imagined, to take place aboard the Commerce: Captain Chevers was to proceed with his ship, sailors, and marines to Cape Hatteras, making all possible haste to destroy an American shore battery and two gunboats commanding the southern inlet to the sound.  

For five hundred miles we drilled with our small boats, a sweet-sailing cutter and the smaller launch, twenty sailors in the one and twelve marines in the other, rowing round and round the Commerce as she sailed north under a steady topsail breeze. 

“Be a good marine.”

Launch and row. Hook on and raise up. Heave hearty now, look alive! 

Be a good marine. 

Dryfire musket from the topmast 100 times. Captain Low says we lose a yard of accuracy for every degree of northern latitude gained, though the surgeon denies this empirically and is happy to show you the figures. 

Be a good marine. 

Eat and sleep. Ship’s biscuit and salt beef, dried peas and two pints grog. Strike the bell and turn the glass. Pipe-clay and polish, lay out britches and waistcoat in passing rains to wash out salt stains. Black-brush top hat and boots. 

Be a good marine. 

Raise and Lower boats again. This time we pull in the *Commerce’s wake, Captain Low on the taffrail, gold watch in hand while we gasp and strain at our oars. By now both launch and the cutter had their picked crews, and those sailors left to idle on deck during our exercises developed something of a chip on their shoulder, which only nurtured our sense of elitism. It wasn’t long before we began ribbing them with cries of, “See to my oar there, Mate!” and requests to send letters to loved ones in the event of our glorious deaths.  

This disparity ended when a calm sea, the first such calm since our ship parted Admiral Warren’s squadron, allowed the others to work up the sloop’s 14 4-pounder cannons, for it was they who would take on the American gunboats while we stormed the battery. 

At quarters each evening they blazed steadily away, sometimes from both sides of the ship at once, running the light guns in and out on their tackle, firing, sponging and reloading in teams. 

Teale and I often watched from the topmast, some eighty feet above the roaring din on deck. From this rolling vantage the scene was spectacular: the ship hidden by a carpet of smoke flickering with orange stabs of cannon fire, and the plumes of white water in the distance where the round shot struck. 

All hands were therefore in a state of happy exhaustion when, to a brilliant sunrise breaking over flat seas, the Commerce raised the distant fleck of St Augustine on her larboard bow. From here it was only 3-days sail to Cape Hatteras, but our stores were dangerously low, and Captain Chevers was not of mind to take his sloop into battle without we had plenty of fresh water for all hands. 

I was unloading the boats, clearing our stored weapons, stripping the footpads and making space to ferry our new casks aboard, when a breathless midshipman came running down the gangway. “Captain Chevers’ compliments to the Corporal, and would it please you to come to his cabin this very moment?” 

In three minutes’ time I was in my best scarlet coat, tight gators and black neckstock, sidearm and buttons gleaming, at the door of the Captain’s Cabin. His steward appeared to show me inside, grunting approval at the perfect military splendor of my uniform.

“And don’t address the Captain without he speaks to you first,” he said, a fully dispensable statement. 

The door opened, and for a moment I was blinded by the evening glare in the cabin’s magnificent stern windows. 

The captain was in conference with his officers and Captain Low, whose red jacket stood out among the others’ gold-laced blue. There was also a gentleman I didn’t know, a visitor from the town with a prodigious grey beard. Despite his age and missing left eye he was powerfully built and well-dressed, with the queen’s Order of Bath shining on his coat. 

Musing navigational charts, their discussion carried on for some moments while I stood at strict attention, a deaf and mute sentry to whom eavesdropping constituted breach of duty.

It appeared the old gentleman had news of a Dutch privateer, a heavy frigate out of Valparaiso, laden with gold to persuade native Creek warriors to the American side. The gentleman intended to ambush this shipment on its subsequent journey overland, where it would be most vulnerable, and redirect the gold to our Seminole allies. He knew one of our marines had escaped a plantation in Indian country, and he would be most grateful for a scout who knew the territory. 

At the word scout all eyes turned on me, and he said, “Is this your man?” Stepping around the desk he offered me a calloused hand. “Stand easy, Corporal.” 

Major Low offered a quick glance, a permissive tilt of the head none but I could have noticed. 

I saluted and removed my hat, taking the old man’s hand and returning its full pressure, no small feat. 

“Sir Edward Nicolls,” he said. “At your service.” 

I recognized the name at once. Back on Tangier Island, my drill instructors spoke of Major-General Nicolls in reverent tones, that most famous of royal marine officers whose long and bloodied career had been elevated to legend throughout the fleet. 

Even the ship’s surgeon, an outspoken critic of the British military as exploiters of destitute, able-bodied youths fleeing slavery, grudgingly estimated that Sir Nicolls’ political efforts as an abolitionist led to thousands of former slaves being granted asylum on British soil. Protected by the laws of His Majesty, they could no longer be arrested and returned as rightful property.  

Indeed, it was this horrifying possibility that was to blame for my current summons. As a marine I’d been frequently shuffled from one ship’s company to another, or detached with the army for inshore work, but never had I been consulted on the order, much less given the option to refuse. 

“It seems there’s some additional risk,” said Captain Chevers, “Beyond the military risk, that is, for you personally . . . a known fugitive in Georgia. If captured it’s likely you’d not be viewed as a prisoner of war, entitled to certain rights and so forth, but as a freedom-seeker and vagabond. A wanted criminal.”  

“Captain Low here insisted you’d be delighted to volunteer,” said Sir Nicolls with a wry look, “But I must hear it from you.” 

I hadn’t thought of the miserable old plantation for weeks, maybe longer. Being a good marine had taken my full measure of attention. But now in a flash my mind raced back along childhood paths, through tangled processions of forest, plantation, and marsh, seemingly endless until they plunged into the wide Oconee River, and beyond that, the truly wild country. 

Then came the predictable memories of Abigail, the house slave born to the plantation the same year as I, cicadas howling as we explored every creek and game trail, and how later as lovers absconded to many a pre-discovered hideout familiar to us alone. 

It occurred to me they were waiting on my answer. Sir Nicolls had filled the interim of my reverie with remarks that there was no pressing danger of such capture, particularly as he had a regiment of highlanders on station, all right forward hands with a bayonet, and that I stood to receive 25 pounds sterling for services rendered. But soon he could stall no longer.

“Well then, what do you say, Corporal?”

I said: “If you please, sir . . . the corporal would be most grateful.” 

Sir Nicolls beard broke with a broad smile, and even Captain Low’s expression showed something not unlike approval.

“Spoken like a good marine!” Said Sir Nicolls.

“There you have it,” said Chevers. “Mr. Low, please note Corporal Gideon to detach and join the highland company at Spithead. And gentlemen, let us remind ourselves that the Admiral first gets his shore battery and gunboats. Now, where in God’s name is Dangerfield with our coffee?” ",1,1753024483.0,writers,1,1.0,False

This machine caught my eye with its promise of convenience, sleek design, and helpful features like the illuminated reusable filter. For someone who takes their coffee-making process seriously, this coffee maker seemed like a dream on paper, but as always, the devil’s in the details. Let’s dive into the experience of using this coffee maker on a daily basis.

**Design & Build Quality**

Straight out of the box, the modern black and stainless steel design of the Hamilton Beach 14 Cup Coffee Maker is genuinely stunning; it looks like it was made to blend into any kitchen aesthetic. The dimensions make it a compact fit, even on my cluttered countertop, and it uses just the right mix of metal and plastic to give it a durable yet lightweight feel. However, one thing I noticed when I first set it up was that the material of the water reservoir cap seemed a bit flimsy. While it hasn’t caused any issues yet, I can’t help but wonder how it will hold up over time.

**Ease of Use**

Being a non-morning person, I truly appreciated the simple, touch-activated display on this coffee maker. It remains dark until you actually need it, which is oddly satisfying and gives the appliance a futuristic vibe. The illuminated markings on the reusable filter are the hero feature here. Just fill ground coffee directly into the filter to the correct level, and you’re good to go—no measuring spoons required. I tested this feature over multiple mornings, and the accuracy for the coffee-to-water ratio is shockingly reliable. However, the touchscreen can occasionally be unresponsive if your hands are even slightly damp, which turned into an annoying hiccup during rushed mornings.

**Performance & Programmability**

The Hamilton Beach 46220 shines with its versatility. It offers a 24-hour programmable delay brew, allowing me to set it up the night before, so the coffee was hot and ready as I stumbled into the kitchen half-asleep. The Auto Pause & Pour option is another thoughtful addition. Testing this out, I was able to sneak in a cup mid-brew without making a mess—a lifesaver when I was running late. Nevertheless, while the coffee stays hot longer than many other machines, it doesn’t quite retain the piping-hot temperature closer to the brew’s end, especially if the warming plate is set to automatically turn off.

**Merits**

- Sleek, modern design with intuitive touch-activated display.  
- Game-changing reusable filter with clear, illuminated markings eliminates guesswork.  
- Large 70 oz. water reservoir with convenient visibility for refills.  
- Programmable brewing and auto shut-off offer peace of mind.  
- Auto Pause & Pour feature is perfect for the impatient coffee drinker.  

**Areas for Improvement**

- Touchscreen struggles with wet or damp fingers, which can be frustrating during quick use.  
- The water reservoir cap feels a bit too fragile for long-term daily use.  
- The coffee loses its optimal hot temperature if not consumed quickly after brewing.  

**Brew Quality**

Here is where the real test lies—how does the coffee taste? I tried a variety of coffee grounds during my daily trials, and the Hamilton Beach 46220 consistently produced smooth, balanced cups of coffee. The drip brewing process is reliable, and even on days when I threw dark roast into the mix, the machine didn’t over-extract, which is another plus. One disappointment, though, was the absence of advanced temperature controls. While the simplicity works for most, the lack of additional customization could be a dealbreaker for hardcore coffee enthusiasts.

**Competing Options**

In a sea of coffee makers, there are several competitors that vie for attention. For example, the Cuisinart DCC-3200 has a slightly higher-end look and offers similar programmable features. However, it doesn’t come with the illuminating reusable filter, which definitely sets the Hamilton Beach coffee maker apart. The Ninja CE251 is another rival and has a more robust warming function, but it lags behind in ease of cleaning and simplicity of the brewing process. While some alternatives might excel in certain areas, the illuminated filter here really saves time, especially during busy mornings.

**Value Proposition**

Considering the Hamilton Beach 46220’s feature set, it certainly delivers on convenience and visual appeal for its price range. Many coffee makers with similar programmable and reusable filter features easily dip into a higher price bracket. Testing it against more budget-friendly options, I found the ease of use and thoughtful additions like the Auto Pause & Pour really made this machine stand out. For someone looking for an everyday coffee maker that gets the job done without any unnecessary complexities, it's hard to find a better functional compromise.

I'm so grateful to have this space to share :) PLEASE, advices and input of anykind are welcome, I'm feeling a little bit lost and would be helpful

**CONTEXT**  
My husband (M33) and I are childfree and atheists. I have a history of depression, and after a burnout 3 months ago, I quit my office job as a software engineer because I wanted more creative work.

Happily, being a homemaker matches with this like taking care of the house, cooking, cleaning, planning meals, tidying everything...

Modestly, I'm good at everything I focus on and have interest in doing, and since I lived alone for 6 years before marriage, I know the basics of how to take care of a house, so it wasn't scary or anything.

My husband works from home and supported me, and now we live off his salary along with some passive income I have, it's little, but gives me some support too.

**MAIN DIFFERENCES**  
After working in the corporate world for the last 5 years, I reached a place of gray emptiness inside me.

I had to kill feelings and creativity to thrive, because emotions and self-worth get in the way if you want to climb the corporate ladder. (Especially in my male-dominated field, I felt every day like I had to “earn my place” in my team as an engineer, and I was often the only woman.)

I felt like I had to fight for my space, until it all lost meaning, and I decided to focus my energy on something more important: me, my husband, and my two little dogs, my family.

I'm much happier now, mainly because I AM HEALING. Having a burnout is just like the name says, there’s nothing left, apparently a feeling that there's not even the possibility to grow healthy again.

But we can grow, and we can water the plants of our mind and soul, and let them flourish, while finding meaning in a place where you can work with love, passion, and nurture a home. Bringing color, joy and most important purpose to your days, a purpose that does not revolve around PROFIT or making clients happy.

**STRUGGLES**

* I struggle to wake up at what I consider early (my goal and dream is to be up at 8h, but my biological clock insists on 9:30h, since it’s been my work schedule for years). But I always have a better day when I wake up early, even though it costs me a lot.
* I still have the urge to check the news on my phone in the morning. For the last 2 years I’ve quit all social media except Reddit and YouTube, and it’s been the best thing for my life, I was very addicted to them. Still, I’m not completely free. I have this urge to consume information, and sometimes it makes me more anxious and disconnected than I’d like.
* I often feel like “I’m not doing enough” and have a kind of fear about starting new activities that I could get really immersed in, because I feel they’d take more time than I can give. For example, I’m afraid of starting watercolor painting and losing track of time or feeling like I don’t deserve it, that kind of thing. I still haven’t learned how to deal with this guilt of just letting me do some 'leisure' activity at week days.

**ROUTINE**  
I now have more time to do things I consider fulfilling, and I’ve been resetting my “clock,” since I lived for years with a constant sense of urgency and anxiety. Now, little by little, I’m learning to slow down and do things at a different pace. Some things I’ve been doing in the last few weeks and I’m really happy they’re working out:

* I wake up and take my mornings slowly as possible: skin care, meditate, make breakfast and coffee, and eat with my husband. Sometimes I walk the dog with him (he likes doing it before starting work);
* I made a weekly cleaning schedule. It’s not in English because it’s not my main language, but each square is a weekday and I listed at least 3 house chores to do in about 2h. -> For example, on Thursdays I: clean bathroom 1, clean bathroom 2, do bed and bathroom laundry. Also for each day I added a ""monthly task"" that if I'm feeling for it I do it, it works as a reminder of bigger chores like vacuum the sofa or tidy kitchen and cloth closets, etc.

https://preview.redd.it/cswcoocen1ef1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=657bf05d85f1cf932258f4b7435143e07122e5e6

* After I’m done with the chores, it’s usually lunchtime, so I start cooking if it’s not ready already;

* We eat, and after that I rest a little, watching a show or series;
* Then I start something from my “dopamine list” — it’s a list of things I like to do when I have time, and it includes: study Spanish (I live in a foreign country and need to practise it), read a book, study a new recipe on YouTube from a chef I love and organize what I need to buy for recipes, self-massage (also on YouTube, from a licensed therapist with amazing videos), journaling, starting or continuing soap operas I used to watch as a kid, for nostalgia.
* I also have in my goals: improve my driving skills (but I need my husband to help), practice watercolor painting (still just on the list!), and go to the park to read (I’ve only done it once so far but want to do it more often).
* After doing a “dopamine” task, I usually walk the dogs in the nearby park, and by the time I get back, my husband has already finished working. We have tea and something to eat, usually bread or cake if I baked something, and we go on to watch something like reality shows or play video games. And 3 days a week we go together to the gym.

**CONCLUSION**  
So far, this is the routine I'm trying to keep up every week and improve little by little :)  
What are your thoughts? For someone who faced a burnout, I’m feeling proud of myself and my work but at the same time, I do feel guilty sometimes, as if I need a metric to make sure how my “score” is going, even though I know there’s no one counting scores.

I think it’s just a shift in mentality, that old belief that my worth is tied to my work and the quality of it, and it’s still kind of ingrained in me. And now that I have a much more noble and meaningful kind of work, I still need to adapt to the idea that there are no metrics, no numbers - only feelings and well-being guiding the chores and the work. And for me, that is the true meaning of life.

Anyone relate to anything I’m living right now?

**TL;DR:** After a burnout, I quit my job as a software engineer to become a SAHW and focus on my mental health and my family. I'm building a slower, more intentional routine with house chores, self-care, and fulfilling hobbies. I still struggle with some mindset shifts I inherited from the corporate world, even though I no longer want my sense of success to be measured by metrics or profit. But overall I'm very proud of myself in these few past months and I know it's just the beginning :) Thanks for reading, and also feel free to share how you've been feling and how you've been doing!

Boasting universal compatibility and aiming to improve coffee flavor, they seemed like the kind of practical product I’d regularly put through its paces as someone with a daily coffee addiction. Here’s the breakdown based on my experience.

**Universal Compatibility That Truly Works**

As promised, these filters claim to fit all Cuisinart coffee makers, a bold assertion that I was eager to test. At home, I use a slightly older Cuisinart model, and these filters fit seamlessly in its water reservoir. More impressive was the feedback from a friend who tried them on a newer unit, confirming the same snug compatibility. This broad adaptability makes it incredibly convenient, especially when switching between Cuisinart models.  

[Check GoodCups Fridge Containers price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b08wrsh3h4/)  

**Water Quality That Elevates Coffee Flavor**

I have to admit, I didn’t think much about how filter quality could affect my coffee’s taste—until I started using these replacement filters. The difference was immediate; no more weird chlorine aftertaste. The charcoal material worked well to eliminate impurities, including calcium and odors. My roommate, quite the coffee snob, even remarked on how much richer our morning brews now taste. It’s clear these filters are not just functional but genuinely enhance your coffee experience.

**Ease of Use Simplifies Replacement**

Some water filters come with complicated steps for installation, but not these. Following the instructions to soak the filter, rinse it under cold water, and pop it into the machine was straightforward. I replaced my old filter in under five minutes, and it worked perfectly. Even if you’re not particularly handy, that simple process ensures no headaches.

**Eco-Friendly Touch**

Eco-consciousness is a nice bonus. Knowing these filters are made from recyclable materials eased some of my guilt about frequently replacing them. This environmentally friendly aspect adds a layer of sustainability to your morning cup of coffee.

**Strengths**
- Universal fit for all Cuisinart coffee makers.  
- Effective removal of chlorine, calcium, and odors significantly improves coffee flavor.  
- Simple, quick installation process.  
- Made from recyclable and eco-friendly materials.  

**Critiques**

Despite being very impressed, there were minor issues.  
- The package recommends replacing the filters every two months, but for heavy coffee drinkers like me, this could feel slightly too frequent.  
- The replacement filters are slightly smaller than the original ones, which might make some users worry about long-term durability.

**Competing Products: Peers in the Filtration Game**

Comparing these filters to Keurig charcoal water filters, another major player in the coffee game, there were some notable differences. Keurig filters also provide effective purification but lack the environmental aspect that GoodCups offers. On the downside, Keurig filters tend to fit fewer machine models compared to the universal fit of these replacement filters. In terms of improving coffee quality, both options perform similarly, but the GoodCups version offers additional eco benefits along with broader compatibility.

**Value for Money**

When evaluating whether these filters are worth it, I’d say yes, primarily because of their performance, easy usability, and universal compatibility. Higher-quality filtration feels like a luxury upgrade for your coffee maker, but without a luxury price tag. Even if they suggest changing every two months, the pack of 12 offers solid mileage, making it a decent investment for coffee lovers.

We have tea and something to eat, usually bread or cake if I baked something, and we go on to watch something like reality shows or play video games. And 3 days a week we go together to the gym.

**CONCLUSION**  
So far, this is the routine I'm trying to keep up every week and improve little by little :)  
What are your thoughts? For someone who faced a burnout, I’m feeling proud of myself and my work but at the same time, I do feel guilty sometimes, as if I need a metric to make sure how my “score” is going, even though I know there’s no one counting scores.

I think it’s just a shift in mentality, that old belief that my worth is tied to my work and the quality of it, and it’s still kind of ingrained in me. And now that I have a much more noble and meaningful kind of work, I still need to adapt to the idea that there are no metrics, no numbers - only feelings and well-being guiding the chores and the work. And for me, that is the true meaning of life.

Anyone relate to anything I’m living right now?

**TL;DR:** After a burnout, I quit my job as a software engineer to become a SAHW and focus on my mental health and my family. I'm building a slower, more intentional routine with house chores, self-care, and fulfilling hobbies. I still struggle with some mindset shifts I inherited from the corporate world, even though I no longer want my sense of success to be measured by metrics or profit. But overall I'm very proud of myself in these few past months and I know it's just the beginning :) Thanks for reading, and also feel free to share how you've been feling and how you've been doing!

1m4r03z,https://www.reddit.com/r/self/comments/1m4r03z/am_i_abusive_and_controlling/,Am I abusive and controlling?,"My wife has some friends and each of them has a situation. One is divorced (came from abusive husband) and all she does is gossiping about her ex and his family and usually cries, the other one a very open woman whose husband makes comment about hot teenage girls in front of her and she seems to be fine with it, the other one posts her open dressed pictures in her instagram so she can make followers and make money without doing a job, plus two other women in this group. Every now and then one of them kick the husbands out of home and they get together in that home, besides having restaurant and coffee gathering every week or so. 

One time we got together with one of the couples in a restaurant and all the husband was saying all the time was how good he is and how dumb others are and his behaviour with the waitress in the restaurant was very very disrespectful (which is always a red flag for me specially when I have people of colour serving me) and then he started to comments on how hot teenage girls wear dresses and made really creepy gestures. For the rest of them, seems really not much talking about the partners and not any intention about having gatherings with partners. So it is always a girl night thing. 

This is going on for a while and I asked my wife while she is enjoying having them, she can also find some better people who respect others and respect at least their own privacy and don’t gossip. Or at least someone that I also enjoy talking to their husbands when we get together and not a wild person who commented on how hot teenage girls wear cloths while he is in his late 40s. It’s in a way that even my wife is not comfortable to invite their husbands to our home but she says I’ll do it because I want to have friends and have fun. We had other couples out of this group came to our home and I really enjoyed spending time with them but then somehow my wife got disconnected with them. So she always gets back to this group of friends.

I’m a software developer in my mid 30s who is not a bar guy or anything of this kind, I’m social and enjoy talking to people, but right group of people. In my opinion right means someone who respectfully talks (or at least doesn’t gossip or does not talk sexual in front of others) and that’s it! I think there is always a nice topic to talk about with someone and it really doesn’t matter what. I get along with people so easy and I enjoy having good time. I’m like…. you get the tea, I get the cake and let’s talk! 

To me this seems unusual and most of my friends usually have gatherings with their partners and sometimes they have girl nights or boys get to gather for a drink and game. But people usually try to have their partners in their gathering (at least from what I see!). I’m happy that she has good time with these people and she enjoys hanging out with them but as we all know….people around you define you….and the more you spend time with someone, the more you become like them. 

We are in Canada and from what I see people really want and enjoy spending time with their family and children rather than regular girl nights. At least it’s the case in the city that we live. Not sure how usual is it but that aside, generally I want better people in our life specially now that she is pregnant and we are expecting a baby soon.

Am I abusive or controlling to ask her find better people and limit her gatherings with this group of friends?",2,1753023540.0,self,1,1.0,False

I had multiple dreams last night, 

The first dream included my daughter (26), but it was a different time, sometime in the past. She was sitting somewhere in nature with lots of tall trees around her, she was looking around. But there was war happening above her in the air, there was planes and you could hear shooting and the sound of war. 
I tried screaming at her to run away and hide but she just kept looking around. 

Second dream, included me hosting for my friends and I offered them coffee, but as the visit kept going, I never presented the coffee, I served them food, and other drinks but never the coffee. Then when it came time to say goodbye, my friend came up to me and said don’t listen to them, they just like to say things like that. The first person to say good bye was my son (21), who wasn’t present during the rest of the dream, he hugged me and said “bye ma” and his hug felt so real. 
After that I woke up and almost wanted to go run and wake him up and ask why he was saying goodbye. 
All my children are alive, most adults. I’ve been having a lot of dreams lately and would like help interpreting them. ",2,1753023481.0,DreamInterpretation,0,1.0,False

# Chapter 44: Fire in a Glass

It started as a quiet kind of sweetness—their hands still loosely joined, the air between them charged with something too delicate to name.

Kazuya looked at Elsa the way teenagers in 13th grade might look at their crush during a school trip—soft disbelief, a little shy, a lot stunned. He could feel something settling in his chest. A peace that wasn’t numbness. A quiet joy. Something that scared him—but also made him feel alive.

*What is this feeling?* he thought. *Why does she make me feel like I’m not the broken one anymore?*

Then—

""Yo.""

A shadow fell over their table.

A man in tinted sunglasses, a fitted leather jacket, and flashy designer sneakers stood a few feet away. His smile oozed smugness, posture cocked like he’d walked off a music video shoot. His voice projected just enough to draw attention from the nearby tables.

“I saw you earlier,” he said, eyes on Elsa, ignoring Kazuya entirely. “You bought the whole rack for this guy. Thought you were his big sister—until I saw the matching watches.”

*Insult me, but never insult Elsa, you bastard.*

Elsa’s eyes narrowed, expression sharpening into something arctic.

*Again,* she thought, *always someone thinking love has a price tag.*

He took a confident step forward, tossing a glossy business card on the table. “Name’s Ryo. Actor. Model. Influencer. You might’ve seen my face on two skincare billboards down the escalator.”

He grinned wider. “Anyway… I just had to ask. Why him?” He gestured at Kazuya with a shrug that dripped insult. “Not exactly the type I’d expect with someone like you.”

Kazuya said nothing. His expression didn’t change. He merely leaned back and brushed a hand through his hair, calm, collected.

*Here we go again,* he thought. *The part where they remind me I don't deserve to be chosen by someone like her.*

Elsa inhaled to speak—but Kazuya cut in.

“Let me guess,” he said, voice light but laced with steel. “You had a sponsor. Sugar mama, right? And she dropped you the moment she saw someone newer?”

Ryo blinked.

Kazuya didn’t break eye contact. “Yeah. Thought so.”

A nearby waiter froze, eyes flicking between them.

The smile on Ryo’s face died. “You’ve got a smart mouth for someone who clearly lucked into his seat.”

He stepped forward again, a little too close.

Kazuya stood slowly. No flare. No dramatics. Just a solid presence that made Ryo freeze mid-stride.

*The last time I was in a fist fight, Kibe had broken his nose. I wonder if I can break his wrist, then his limbs? That might be fun.*

“I’m not going to fight you,” Kazuya said calmly. “But if you disrespect Elsa again, I will end whatever brand deals you think you still have—one broken wrist at a time.”

Ryo’s cocky veneer cracked. He backed off, scoffing. “Whatever, man. Enjoy your charity date.”

*Back off, loser.*

Kazuya reached across the table and took Elsa’s hand again, this time not loosely, but firmly—like a shield anchoring itself to the person it swore to protect. His grip wasn’t forceful, but certain. Sure. The kind of hold that said: *You’re safe. I’ve got you.*

Elsa’s heart skipped. It wasn’t the hold of a boy too shy to touch. It was the grasp of a man ready to stand.

Then another interruption came—from the left.

A woman in a black cocktail dress, older, elegant, her interest predatory. She approached with a champagne smile.

“If you ever grow tired of toy gifts,” she said to Kazuya, voice like silk, “I know a place where real men are dressed in finer things.”

Elsa's eyes were as cold as ice.

""Hey, hey, hey,"" said the woman, now staring at Elsa. ""What you can buy, I can buy too. But that kind of guy? That is someone I want. That tight hold of your hand? That is something I crave.""

*I want to burn this woman in hell.*

Kazuya turned to her, expression polite but pointed.

“Thank you,” he said smoothly. “But I’m not up for auction.”

He looked to Elsa.

“We should go.”

“Agreed.”

They left Café Belladonna just as murmurs rippled across the tables. Security trailed behind, but no one stopped them. The scene diffused, but not forgotten.

Outside, the late afternoon sun bathed the mall’s glass corridor in amber. They walked in silence, with Kazuya's hand clasping Elsa’s like he never wanted to let go. They exited the mall and walked away from the busy streets.

Elsa didn’t speak.

She didn’t need to.

Inside her chest, something deep and long-hidden trembled.

Her mind flashed:

Thirteen years old. Standing in a hallway. Girls sneering, whispering. Boys saying they liked her but always just watching. Never defending.

You’re too much.  
Too smart.  
Too proud.  
Too pretty.  
Too cold.

*No one ever defended me.*

*Until now.*

Her fingers tightened in his.

“So this is what it feels like,” she thought, swallowing hard. “To be fought for. Not because I’m fragile, not because I needed saving—but because I matter to someone.”

*And he didn’t hesitate. Not for a second. Not even when eyes were on us. Not even when he knew there would be whispers. He didn’t shrink. He stood.*

Kazuya didn’t say a word.

But as they passed a mirrored column, she saw his face in the reflection—jaw set, eyes blazing with the fire of someone who had finally chosen not just to care—but to protect.

And in that second, she smiled.

*Let the world whisper. Let them stare.*

*I’ve already won.*

But just as they reached the park—

""Yo, prick!"" someone called out.

It was Ryo.

""You think you won, huh?""

[🎧 "" Merry Christmas Everybody"" - Slade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aGzGe6lTyZ0)

# Chapter 45: Fire and Bones

Kazuya’s eyes snapped toward the voice. His instincts flared.

He moved without thinking, stepping in front of Elsa, one arm stretched backward to shield her. Her hand met his, and for a moment, she resisted.

""Let it go,"" she whispered. ""If it’s money he wants, I can pay.""

But Kazuya didn’t answer. His eyes were locked on Ryo—now swaggering toward them again.

Ryo smirked. ""You made me look bad back there. Broke my image. Broke my vibe. So now... I break you.""

He raised his voice for the crowd. ""Ladies and gentlemen, look at this! Prince Charming here thinks he can just walk around with someone like her? Cute story. Really. But come on—we all know she deserves better.""

He gestured to Kazuya. ""I will teach him what better looks like. And I’ll make sure to break that pretty face. We don’t need charity cases out here parading like they belong.""

Elsa tugged at Kazuya’s sleeve again. ""Please. This isn’t worth it.""

But he didn’t move.

Kazuya stepped forward slowly.

No fear. No hesitation.

*The old me would've panicked. Said sorry. Laughed it off. But he's gone. That pathetic, spineless version of me died months ago. This... this is the man who fights.*

Ryo’s voice continued behind them, laced with arrogance.

""You know what I hate most about guys like you? You look harmless, like a good boy. You get a taste of attention and suddenly think you're some alpha. You think you can keep a woman like that? Please. You’ll be a footnote by next week.""

Still, Kazuya said nothing. He simply looked at the ground, then at the sky—quiet, calculating. Breathing in. Centering.

Ryo stammered backward, hand fumbling for his phone.

""You want to know what I learned?"" he said, voice calm. Too calm. ""In the streets, there are no rules. Just one. Survive.""

Too late.

Kazuya’s fist collided with his face.

Crunch. Blood. Cracked veneer. A moan of pain.

Gasps echoed from bystanders. A man dropped his coffee. A child cried out.

Elsa, wide-eyed, pulled her phone out, fingers shaking, texting her mother in rapid bursts:

*Ryo Nakamura. Actor. Assault. Park by Rifare. Shut him and his career down. Permanently.*

Her mother called immediately.

Elsa declined. Texted instead:

*Please. Just make sure he never touches us again. I’ll explain everything later.*

The next moment, Ryo managed a swing. Sloppy. Desperate.

Kazuya caught his wrist.

And twisted.

Crack.

A scream.

With his free hand, Kazuya punched Ryo in the gut, dropping him like a sack of flour.

And then, before Elsa could shout again, he stomped on the side of Ryo’s head—with rage and precision, like a predator about to kill his prey.

He was about to go all in. He didn't care about the consequences. This felt like therapy for all the trauma he had buried. He was pouring it all into Ryo.

""That’s enough!"" Elsa cried, grabbing Kazuya’s arm. ""Please.""

He looked down at her.

Her eyes were wide. Teary. Scared—not of him.

Of how far he was willing to go.

And yet, beneath that fear... was awe.

Because she wasn’t used to being defended. Not like this. Not by someone who didn’t need her wealth, or power, or name. Just someone who *chose* to protect her.

Kazuya stared at his hands. Bloodied. Shaking.

Then he looked at Elsa.

*I don’t need to be gentle all the time. I just need to be brave when it counts.*

He held her hands.

They were trembling.

But she didn’t pull away.

*The old Kazuya is dead,* he thought. *This is who I am now. The man who fights when it matters. The man who stands when everyone else runs.* *The man who fights for someone he loves.*

And then...

*Someone he loves.*

The word echoed.

He stared at Elsa.

She wasn’t speaking.

But her eyes answered the word in his heart.

They didn’t run.

They walked away together.

Behind them, Ryo lay on the pavement, groaning, his broken pride louder than the pain.

But no one moved to help him.

They were watching something else.

They were watching *them.*

# Chapter 46: The Quiet Choice

The headlines were everywhere. Social media buzzed like an electric storm:

**""Rising Actor Ryo Nakamura Hospitalized After Alleged Altercation with Student Kazuya Kinoshita.""**

**""From Nobody to Headline: Who Is the Boy who Protected Academic Elsa Bayer?""**

**""Campus Royalty or Public Scandal? Kinoshita and Bayer Spotted in Rifare Okinawa Aftermath.""**

Kazuya didn’t bother scrolling further. He powered off his phone and set it aside.

""Well,"" he muttered, staring out the window of the quiet resting area in Rifare’s rooftop garden, ""there goes my peace.""

But then he turned his gaze to Elsa, seated beside him on a minimalist wooden bench, sunlight playing against her snow-white hair. Her fingers lightly brushed his. Not by accident.

He looked down at their hands. Then laced his fingers with hers.

""It doesn’t matter,"" he said softly. ""I found it in you anyway.""

Elsa’s chest tightened. The words hit harder than he probably realized.

Kazuya then asked her. “You know, something feels not that right, like you are hiding something from me.”

Kazuya glanced the watch, and he was doing the math. It’s impossible to buy that watch and then the whole wardrobe for an academic.

Elsa answered. “I can earn a million yen from one paper, Kazuya. So I just need to write papers and it will print money.”

“That’s it?”

“That’s it.”

“Well then, just make sure you are not a daughter of a drug lord of a cartel at Mexico, or a runaway princess from Europe. Because if you are, tell me now so we can do something about it.”

*Kazuya don’t press further okay. Please.*

After a few more minutes of silence, she glanced at him, and something within her stirred. *Kazuya must not be disturbed anymore,* she thought. *Not by family, not by friends, not by the ghosts of Tokyo.*

But she didn’t want to assume.

So she asked, ""Hypothetically... what if your family, or your old friends, found a way to reach you now? After this?""

Kazuya took a deep breath. ""That’s okay. I think I’ve found... maybe sixty percent of myself now. The rest?"" He turned to her, his eyes warm. ""The Quad’s here. And I have you, right?""

Elsa blushed—rare for her. She wasn’t used to being flustered.

And in that moment, she knew it. *I won. At least for now.*

But Kazuya’s voice grew distant, reflective. ""If I had the choice, I’d write them instead. A letter. Let them know I’m okay, but that I’m not ready to return. Not yet. Not when I’m still rebuilding.""

He stared at the garden’s small koi pond, its surface rippling with the soft breeze.

""I want to stay in Okinawa. Isolated for now. With my new family. With... you.""

He paused.

""I don’t know how to face them. Especially since my family supported Chizuru. They meant well, but I need space. I want to reappear when I’m better. As for my friends, to show them that their faith in me—helping me escape—it wasn’t wasted.""

Elsa listened carefully, memorizing every word like scripture.

She took a quiet breath and offered, ""Then write the letter tomorrow. I’ll have it delivered anonymously through the university’s administrative channel. No sender name. No return address. Just your words.""

Kazuya didn’t question her network. After all she’d shown him—her resources, her reach—he knew better than to doubt her now.

He just nodded.

Then, with a hesitant smile, he asked, ""So... where are we having dinner tonight?"" He gestured vaguely toward the mall below. ""Considering I’ve just become the new face of scandal, going out might cause a scene.""

Elsa blinked. He was... asking? About dinner?

She felt her heart skip.

He was choosing to extend the day. With her.

She considered briefly closing an entire restaurant, but quickly dismissed the idea. *Not yet. He wasn’t ready for that kind of flex.*

""My place,"" she said casually. ""We’ll have Christmas dinner at my apartment.""

He tilted his head. Then, a scowl. ""I thought you lived in the dorms?""

Elsa froze—but only for a fraction of a second.

Then she recovered smoothly. ""The university owns an apartment nearby. It’s for researchers and post-grads. I got assigned one. Quiet. Convenient.""

Kazuya raised an eyebrow but didn’t press further. ""Sounds perfect.""

*Elsa, you better not break my trust. It took me a leap of faith to trust you like what I am doing right now.*

Elsa nodded, trying not to let her nervous energy show.

As he leaned back against the bench, she stood up. ""I’ll be right back. Restroom.""

She walked briskly toward the restroom corridor, and the moment she was alone, pulled out her phone.

**Elsa:** *He’s coming to the villa. Inform everyone it’s university-owned for researchers. Say the others went home for Christmas, so we got it solo. I’ll fill in the rest tomorrow.*

Her mother’s reply came within seconds.

**Mom:** *Are you winning?*

Elsa smirked.

**Elsa:** 🏆(Trophy Emoji)

**Mom:** *Your father will be proud.* 💖(Heart Emoji)

Elsa pocketed the phone.

*Kazuya Kinoshita.*

She had fought tooth and nail to earn this chance—not through manipulation or wealth, but by standing beside him. Steady. Present.

And now, she had one more evening to make it count.

This dinner... would not be about power.

It would be about warmth.

About showing him what home could look like.

With her.

The airport lounge was pristine, wrapped in gold-tinted light as the sun prepared to set over Tokyo. People moved with practiced ease. Rolling suitcases hummed against the polished floor. Announcements echoed softly through the terminals.

Chizuru Mizuhara sat by the glass panels overlooking the runway, a steaming cup of black coffee in her hand, her phone in the other. She just finished talking to the Kinoshitas who wished her luck, but Grandma Nagomi immediately told her to open her socials.

She scrolled.

And there it was.

**""Campus Mayhem or Chivalry Reborn? Kazuya Kinoshita Protects Elsa Bayer in Shocking Confrontation with Ryo Nakamura.""**

Her thumb froze.

Photos.

Elsa. Kazuya. Blood on his sleeves. Her clinging to him, crying. The crowd in shock. Security rushing in.

The blood drained from her face. But she didn’t flinch.

Not until she saw the video.

Kazuya shielding Elsa. His voice cold. Ryo on the ground.

Kazuya walking away, holding Elsa close. A war-torn prince and the woman he chose.

A tear rolled down Chizuru’s cheek before she could stop it.

*She’s moving fast. Too fast. And I... I let time slip.*

She pulled up her Notes app. The screen glowed with organized chaos: filming schedules, agency meetings, award show invites, a two-year roadmap to superstardom.

But none of it made her feel better.

She scrolled down, found the ""non-negotiables"" section.

Deleted three roles.

*I need a year,* she thought, fingers trembling.

She paused. Then scrolled back up and highlighted a stretch of three to four months.

*That’s my window.*

She could come back then. Check on him. Interrupt whatever progress Elsa had made. Plant a reminder. A seed of doubt. Something to slow the storm down.

She closed the app and stared at the boarding gate ahead.

The LED screen flashed: *Flight 271 - Seoul, Boarding Now.*

Chizuru stood, adjusted her coat, and breathed in.

*Move faster, Elsa.*

*Run ahead all you want.*

*Because when I come back...*

*I’ll be prepared.*

*And this time, I won’t hesitate.*

Her heels clicked as she walked toward her gate, each step sharper than the last.

And behind her—in her wake—the fire didn’t fade.

It burned brighter.

My name's Brian from the Netherlands. Currently, I'm working towards a bachelor degree majoring in communication and work a little on the side, but that's stuff that's boring, so enough about that. I like gaming on my Switch, PC and PlayStation and I do a teeny tiny bit of photography and sketching when I get inspired. The sketching I do both on paper with pencils and digitally using a pen display. I usually also watch sci-fi/fantasy series and movies, and on occasion animated shows (like anime or western animation). I'm very introverted and be a bit shy until I get comfortable talking to you.

I'm looking for someone about my age that is also looking for a serious long term relationship. While I have little prior experience with relationships, I do value strong connections and want to build a special and even stronger one. I wouldn't say I have any set preferences in terms of appearances, but I do prefer being around a similar age. While I'm also not against an LDR, I prefer someone who lives nearby (nearby = Netherlands/Belgium/UK/Germany), but it's not an issue if you live farther away. It's not a problem for me if the distance between us is big. Because if the spark is there, then no distance will be too great. Of course, I'm open to just being friends too, but that's if we end up not being compatible as more.

1m4qx6h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4qx6h,"Drama Smackdown: Bad Boys & Reformed Playboys (Same Toxic Energy, Different Tax Bracket)","**Greetings**, sleep-deprived bingers making questionable choices at 3 AM, everyone who's ever said ""he's not that bad"" about a fictional CEO, and those of us whose standards have been permanently destroyed by men in suits learning what emotions are!

 This week on Drama Smackdown, we're diving into the unholy union of Bad Boys and Reformed Playboys, because whether he's a leather-jacket rebel or a three-piece-suit sociopath, we all know the formula: emotionally unavailable man discovers feelings.exe after meeting one (1) woman with self-respect.

 TL;DR: The bad boy/reformed playboy pipeline is real, vertical dramas perfected it, and we're all complicit in making ""I can fix him"" a valid business model. Whether he's brooding on a motorcycle or brooding in a boardroom, the ending is the same: complete personality transplant in under 60 minutes.



 **The Formula: Emotional Manipulation Speedrun Edition**

 Every bad boy/reformed playboy drama is just this recipe with different seasoning:

🔸 Minutes 1-5: Meet our disaster - He's either punching walls (bad boy) or emotionally punching hearts (playboy). Zero emotional regulation, maximum jawline.

🔸 Minutes 6-15: Enter the catalyst - She's ""different."" She doesn't swoon at his wealth/motorcycle/general toxicity. System error. Does not compute.

🔸 Minutes 16-30: The malfunction - Watch a grown man short-circuit because a woman has boundaries. Includes: aggressive wall-pinning, jealous glaring, and declaring ownership of a human being in public.

🔸 Minutes 31-45: The crisis - She might leave! She's in danger! Another man exists within her vicinity! Time for our bad boy to have his first feeling since 2009.

🔸 Minutes 46-55: Magical personality transplant - He's reformed! Now he's just possessive instead of abusive. Growth!



 **Bad Boy vs Playboy: A Taxonomy of Terrible**

 The Street Bad Boy: Leather jacket, motorcycle, tragic backstory probably involving dead parents. Communicates through grunts and jaw clenches. Reforms when she gets hurt because of his ""dangerous lifestyle."" Suddenly discovers he wants to open a flower shop or some shit.

 **The Corporate Bad Boy** (aka Playboy CEO): Armani suits, penthouse, tragic backstory involving emotionally distant parents. Treats women like disposable coffee cups. Reforms when she'd rather work at McDonald's than be his kept woman. Suddenly capable of saying ""I love you"" without having an aneurysm.

 **The Rebel Rich Boy**: Motorcycle AND money. Disappointing his family is a personality trait. Actually just needs a hug but will settle for aggressively pursuing someone who said no. Reformed when she sees through his ""bad boy act"" to his ""soft boy reality."" Want to see this one in action? Falling into His Trap, featured Tuesday.

 Spoiler: He owns exactly TWO long sleeve shirts.

 They're all the same dude in different fonts. The only real difference is whether the red flag comes with a leather jacket or a Rolex.



 **Why Vertical Format Turns Toxic Into Addictive**

 The genius/evil of vertical dramas is how they weaponize our attention spans:

•	**Emotional Whiplash as Entertainment**: 90-second episodes mean you go from ""I hate him"" to ""I would die for him"" faster than you can say ""Stockholm Syndrome""

•	**The Close-Up Conspiracy**: Every frame is basically pressed against his face. You can see his pupils dilate when he realizes he has feelings. It's emotional invasion and we're consensually here for it.

•	**Cliffhanger Crack**: Episodes end mid-sentence, mid-kiss, mid-emotional-breakthrough. Your brain literally cannot process stopping. It's designed for zero self-control.



 **Fixing Him for Sport: A Vertical Drama Tradition**

 Here's what vertical dramas understand that we won't admit: We don't actually want to fix these men. We want them to come pre-fixed with a gift receipt.

 The bad boy/playboy reform isn't about the journey, it's about being so special that someone rewires their entire personality for you. It's the ultimate main character syndrome. 

 You're not just loved, you're TRANSFORMATIVE. 

 You're basically a human therapy session with better outfits.



 **Why We Can't Stop Watching This Beautiful Garbage**

 Real talk? After a day of being perceived as a regular human, sometimes you want to watch a morally questionable hottie realize you're the sun, moon, and stars in 55 minutes flat.

 We know the wall-slam isn't romantic. We know jealousy isn't cute. We know tracking someone's location is a crime, not courtship. 

 But when he stands in the rain holding the teddy bear, she dropped while declaring his undying love to her unconscious form in the hospital...

 Look, we contain multitudes. We can want healthy relationships AND watch terrible men speedrun emotional development. It's called range.



 **Hot Take: Bad Boys and Playboys Are Just Poorly Socialized Golden Retrievers**

 Strip away the trauma, the leather, the corporate power, and what do you have? Men who don't know how to process emotions until a woman teaches them. They're just expensive rescue dogs who need training. And we're out here like ""I can teach him to love!""

 Girl, he's 35. If he hasn't figured out basic empathy by now, you're not a girlfriend, you're unpaid therapy.



 **Final Verdict?**

 The bad boy/reformed playboy vertical drama is emotional junk food and we're all diabetic at this point. It's the same story in different outfits: emotionally constipated man discovers feelings through the power of one woman's patience.

 Will we stop watching? No. Will we keep complaining while hitting ""next episode""? Absolutely. 

 Because somewhere between the problematic dynamics and the perfect jawlines, these 90-minute emotional rollercoasters hit that sweet spot of ""I hate this but also one more episode.""

 So whether your poison is motorcycle bad boys or CEO playboys, just remember: the only thing getting reformed here is our standards. And honestly? For those moments of that man looking at her like she hung the moon... worth it.



💥 This has been another **Drama Smackdown** \- where we dissect our terrible taste in fictional men at terminal velocity.

My recommendation for this topic? **Falling Into His Trap**. Come back Tuesday for a Bite-Sized Brutality take down of this hot show!

One is divorced (came from abusive husband) and all she does is gossiping about her ex and his family and usually cries, the other one a very open woman whose husband makes comment about hot teenage girls in front of her and she seems to be fine with it, the other one posts her open dressed pictures in her instagram so she can make followers and make money without doing a job, plus two other women in this group. Every now and then one of them kick the husbands out of home and they get together in that home, besides having restaurant and coffee gathering every week or so. 

One time we got together with one of the couples in a restaurant and all the husband was saying all the time was how good he is and how dumb others are and his behaviour with the waitress in the restaurant was very very disrespectful (which is always a red flag for me specially when I have people of colour serving me) and then he started to comments on how hot teenage girls wear dresses and made really creepy gestures. For the rest of them, seems really not much talking about the partners and not any intention about having gatherings with partners. So it is always a girl night thing. 

This is going on for a while and I asked my wife while she is enjoying having them, she can also find some better people who respect others and respect at least their own privacy and don’t gossip. Or at least someone that I also enjoy talking to their husbands when we get together and not a wild person who commented on how hot teenage girls wear cloths while he is in his late 40s. It’s in a way that even my wife is not comfortable to invite their husbands to our home but she says I’ll do it because I want to have friends and have fun. We had other couples out of this group came to our home and I really enjoyed spending time with them but then somehow my wife got disconnected with them. So she always gets back to this group of friends.

I’m a software developer in my mid 30s who is not a bar guy or anything of this kind, I’m social and enjoy talking to people, but right group of people. In my opinion right means someone who respectfully talks (or at least doesn’t gossip or does not talk sexual in front of others) and that’s it! I think there is always a nice topic to talk about with someone and it really doesn’t matter what. I get along with people so easy and I enjoy having good time. I’m like…. you get the tea, I get the cake and let’s talk! 

To me this seems unusual and most of my friends usually have gatherings with their partners and sometimes they have girl nights or boys get to gather for a drink and game. But people usually try to have their partners in their gathering (at least from what I see!). I’m happy that she has good time with these people and she enjoys hanging out with them but as we all know….people around you define you….and the more you spend time with someone, the more you become like them. 

We are in Canada and from what I see people really want and enjoy spending time with their family and children rather than regular girl nights. At least it’s the case in the city that we live. Not sure how usual is it but that aside, generally I want better people in our life specially now that she is pregnant and we are expecting a baby soon.

1m4quo5,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1m4quo5,Should I buy these things for better shots? [Budget 250-400$],"So im fairly new to espresso (previously used Nespresso pods) and have bought a de longhi Dedica with a good quality non pressurized bottomless portafilter, the rancillo steam wand mod and a tamper but that's it, so no coffee scale, grinder or other things. I decided to put all the items I see in these puck prep videos in the basket, and would like to know if it will improve my shots.

For right now I don't have a grinder but im using specialty coffee roasted and ground to order but I can tell it's not very fresh so the grinder is probably the best bet here. Is this hand grinder good? Or is it better to invest in an electric one? Im making 2 espressos in the morning and then 2 flat whites/cappucinos later in the day. My shots right now are not very consistent because I have no scale, so I put the coffee ground in my portafilter and using a fork to replicate the WDT tool 😂, tamp and then pull the shot, one time I used my normal 16g dose and got 107g out...

About grinders, is it better to buy the one in the photo or go electric and buy (e.g. eureka mignon specilita, it costs only 290$ new where im from)

I travel a lot for work. Earlier this week, the hotel I was staying in was out of dark roast coffee so I was forced to get a cup of light roast, and I was disappointed. The flavor profile was weak. The body was light. It didn’t give me my needed morning pick me up. Hence was the birth of this CMV. (For the purposes of this discussion, medium roast will not be considered)

Dark roast coffee is superior to light roast for a number of reasons to include (in general):

Fuller body

More robust flavor profile 

Chocolate/smoky/earthy flavor profile > light, fruity flavor profile for an early morning pick me up. 

Less acidity 

Nice , bitter bite that brings the flavor profile together

Less caffeine 

Easier to maintain a consistent flavor profile through the roasting process in the finished product


Granted, there are some outliers. I’ve had some wonderful Nordic light roasts than really captured the essence of a dark roast coffee, but in general, dark roast tends to be superior from a taste and function perspective.

While St. Louis starter Miles Mikolas (4.94 ERA) had a solid last outing, he allowed a staggering 14 runs across his two starts prior to facing the Nationals on July 10th. Having allowed 19 hits over his last 3 games, Arizona’s offense should have no issue getting at least 5 runs past Mikolas. The Diamondbacks have actually bagged at least 5 runs in their last 5 straight games. My money’s on Arizona to cash their Team Total Over with ease this afternoon.

Would really appreciate any feedback from folks who’ve done something similar or know the vending/small biz space.

Here’s what I’m thinking:

* Used machines go for around €800 here (I’ve seen a bunch on OLX).
* I’d place them in places with steady foot traffic — like laundromats, auto shops, or barbershops — after making a deal with the owner: either a fixed rent (\~€50/month) or a cut per drink sold (\~€0.05).
* If I manage to sell \~10 drinks a day (priced between €0.60 and €1.00), the monthly net profit would be somewhere between €100 and €140, after covering rent.

The idea would be to reinvest profits to buy more machines over time — maybe grow to 3 or 4 if it works.

I’ve done some rough math on costs vs price:

|Drink|Cost (€)|Price (€)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Coffee|0.173|0.60|
|Coffee with milk|0.235|0.65|
|Cappuccino|0.298|0.70|
|Hot chocolate|0.481|0.90|

Would love to hear your thoughts:

* Does this seem like something that could actually work?
* Am I missing any major risks or costs?
* Anyone here done vending before or have tips from experience?

1m4qr6c,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1m4qr6c/our_love_story_was_too_perfect/,Our Love Story Was Too Perfect,"Trevor met Elise at a bookstore. She laughed at his joke about self-help books being less help and more self. He asked her to coffee. It felt organic, lucky. For once, something in his life just *worked out.* Within months, they were married.

She was perfect. Attentive, sweet, a little shy, but always present. She remembered the smallest things he mentioned in passing, a scar on his knee from falling off a bike at seven, his love of red licorice, his favorite song from high school. “It’s like we’ve known each other forever”, she said once. He thought it was romantic.

Then things started feeling… off.

He was emptying boxes after the move. He found a hard drive in a box labelled “Elise's Specials”. Curiosity won out. He decided to take a look at the files. Inside: folders. Hundreds of folders labelled by date going back well over a decade. Long before him first meeting Elise. Opening a folder from February 2019 he found photos of himself sleeping. He didn’t remember taking those. Another folder from August of 2021 had photos of him walking his dog. The photographer was clearly at a distance in a tree. It went on and on like that in each folder. Seemingly every moment of his life, secretly catalogued.

That night, he waited until she was asleep and checked her closet. In a shoebox beneath some sweaters, he found a journal.

In looping, obsessive cursive:

“*Trevor wore the blue shirt again. He looks best in that one. He ate pad thai at noon. I left another note in his mailbox. He didn’t see it. :(*”

“*He smiled at the barista. She isn’t even pretty. I wanted to rip her throat out.*”

“*He cried today. On the couch. I wanted to hold him. I almost knocked.*”

Trevor’s hands shook. The entries continued until the week they met at the bookstore. But now he saw it differently, she had orchestrated everything. She planted the books, faked the laugh. *Organic*, he thought, mocking his past self.

He didn’t sleep.

The next day, he pretended to go to work. Instead, he drove two towns over and checked into a motel. Paid in cash. He’d call the police once he figured out what to say. How do you explain you’d married your decades-long stalker who made herself into your dream girl? Elise probably wasn't even her real name.

He stared at the ceiling until his eyes grew heavy.

A knock woke him. The sun had set. 

Three soft taps.

He didn’t move.

Another knock. Then a voice, soft and familiar: “Trevor. I brought your favorite. Red licorice. Let me in.”

His phone buzzed. A text from Elise read: “You didn't tell me you were going on a business trip. >:( Time to come home. Now.”

He froze.

He hadn’t told anyone where he was. He hadn’t even said it out loud.

Outside the door, she whispered, almost lovingly: “You really shouldn’t have left the shoebox open.” 

Then the doorknob turned.

1m4qq77,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmanitaMuscaria/comments/1m4qq77/1_ounce_trip_report_do_not_try_at_home/,1 Ounce Trip Report (DO NOT TRY AT HOME),"Firstly I would highly advise against anyone taking this amount of Amanita Muscaria. I’m not going to go into super specific detail but I made a decarb tea with an ounce of red hats nd put a gray tea bag in it to mask the nasty raw flavor. Boiled nd simmered for 1 nd a half to 2 hours. Strained through coffee filters into a big mug. Let cool and drank it in about 30 minutes (I should have sipped it over the coarse of an hour). I was already on 25mgs of 7oh so I was feeling pretty good and didn’t notice any nausea. I also would highly advise against mixing these substances (we’ll get to that later). Now within those 30 minutes I was already feeling the tipsy drunken effects typically experienced on lower doses. Within not even an hour things were getting pretty wild. I was on the phone with my friend the whole night luckily because the onset was so fast I couldn’t even grasp that I was blasted out of my mind already. I kept forgetting that I was extremely intoxicated nd she had to keep reminding me “You are gone rn” “you are booted” etc etc. I said Im not going into crazy detail because I honestly don’t remember too much of the visuals. From what I remember at this point into the trip we were on FaceTime so I could see her nd for some reason I couldn’t grasp the reality that she yes is on the phone but isn’t actually here with me. Then the visuals were actually so insane I kept bouncing in nd out of reality. The dissociation was so intense I only got out of bed to puke 3 times (rip my steak dinner). Other than that I was bed locked until I finally crashed to sleep in the early am and woke up at 8am this morning like its ah regular day feeling all refreshed. Back to where we were the visuals I experienced took place at her job (a large department store). I unfortunately do not remember much but I do remember there were other people there nd we were all on top of the shelves. What I experienced was super fun yes but also very insane the entire store started shifting nd morphing into itself. It was like the building was an orb of floating 3d geometry. Every part of the store became a translucent unattached part of itself (no I cant explain any better with words). Everything passed through each other and shifted around like as if the store itself was dancing nd we were on the dance floor getting into it frl. I believe the lesson from this experience is that no man can truly own part of the earth as it was created for all of us to experience nd share amongst each other. I think that because there was a point where the store shifted all of the valuable items into where we were nd cut off access to any others who were present during the trip. Yes I was vividly seeing other people with me nd conversing with them. We tried to block it off nd keep it all to ourselves but shortly after the store took it all away nd redistributed equally every material thing to everyone in the store. This is about all I can recall. The lesson I learned from this intense experience is that no matter how much you think you have in this life, God will always show you how little you truly have nd that you ought to be humble nd not greedy. You should value nd cherish the people nd things you have because it could always be taken away. Living even a decent life is a privilege nd should be treated as such with respect. Thanks for reading please do not attempt to recreate if I did not have my friend to keep me grounded I could have gotten seriously hurt, injured, done something bad, ended up in the hospital etc etc. These mushrooms are no joke. I only chose to do this after 2+ years of experience, yet I am still willing to admit it was dangerous nd immature of me to mix substances especially in such high dosages.

1 Corinthians 11:24

* *And gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, “This is my body, which is given for you. Do this in remembrance of me.”*

**Jesus showed His humanness** in His desire to be remembered. It’s a sign of our belief in immortality that we can’t stand the thought of being forgotten.

Jesus wants us to remember Him, not just at the communion table, but all the time. Keeping Him in constant remembrance blesses us in many ways. It changes us to be more like Him—when we think about others often, we start to resemble them. It also helps us avoid sin and wrongdoing.

Even thinking about a good person can make us ashamed to do something they would disapprove of. Remembering Christ keeps our hearts full of love for Him. It reminds us of His love for us and all He has done, compelling us to love Him more.

Remembering Christ brings us joy, because we’ll never forget that He is our Friend and that He is always with us.",1,1753022801.0,TheDailyDose,0,1.0,False

1m4qlfq,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m4qlfq/mshr_when_the_mountains_hungerpart_1/,[MS][HR] When the Mountains Hunger-Part 1,"The snow kept falling, coating the pinnacles and slopes of the Appalachians in a thick, white, powdery coat, from which only the jagged peaks of leafless trees or twisted evergreens protruded like sickly teeth arrayed upon a corpse's decayed, pale jaw.

Burt padded himself down as he exited the building that passed for a police station. The badge was still there, the sharp pin biting at his chest. He remembered times in his life when that badge seemed to weigh so, so heavy, but none as bad as now. He remembered protests, people carrying signs demanding justice over every real or perceived breach of justice or excessive force employed by a police officer, and how common they seemed to get in those later years, how their words at times enflamed both shame and anger in his heart, so that in the early mornings when he would have to crawl out of bed and go to work, he could barely find the motivation to do so. Life seemed terrible then, but he would trade places with his past self in a heartbeat.

Next, his hand fell to the comforting grip of the gun on his hip, a .38 revolver, old school. A Glock had been his constant companion for many years, but obviously it had become very difficult to source parts for it, so that when the slide had cracked one fateful day, he had no choice but to replace it. He was just thankful it happened while on the range and not when he really needed it, although he had never had to fire a gun in the line of duty as a cop before.

He looked back up at the mountains, towering overhead as he made his way with some difficulty through the snow towards his patrol car. The chill wind whistled between the mountains, carrying off whatever tidings it bore southward, down the very mountain ridge which stretched from the Maine Republic to what was once Georgia. Maybe things were going better down there; he doubted it, but he could only hope. 

These same mountains had seen it all. They had seen continents rise out from under the briny deep and seen them crack asunder. They had withstood the millennia-long sieges of glaciers and stood victorious. They still remembered the ancient tales and stories of the Native Americans that had passed from truths exposed by chiefs and shamans to the whispers that dying, decrepit elders took with them into the afterlife, with none around left to pass them on. The mountains had watched the star-spangled banner rise and reign across the continent, and just the same, they had laughed as the eagle, inevitably, lost its wings. He himself was born here, raised here, and would eventually die here. His body and his mind would once more then return to the native rock from which it was hewn and would rejoin the unending, mycelial memory of those snowy, unfeeling peaks.

As he reached the patrol car, something howled in the distance, and the sound was carried, amplified, and echoed by the slopes, almost as if it were a cold, dry laugh. It was time to go to work.

He drove down the winding, yet familiar, serpentine roads, finally reaching his destination: a dilapidated trailer home, nestled amid a grove of dead trees, neighbored by other similar dwellings. 

“This trailer park was once full of people, surviving day by day, working dead-end jobs they hated for meager pay. I wonder how many of them are left…” he grimly thought to himself. “How many of those small little dwellings, with broken blinds, peeling paint and the whole structure slightly tilting to one side were the result of a person still holding on even though the hope for a better life had long since vanished for them, or were the only inhabitants of these trailers the corpses of people who simply never woke one day, or worse, and lacked anyone else in this world to even notice...”

However, the trailer he was here for had already gathered a small crowd of curious onlookers, mainly men, clutching what guns or weapons they had while their wives and children peered at the scene from yellowed and dirty windows.

“Let’s disperse folks, let’s disperse… This is a police matter now. I’ll handle this quicker if you go back to your homes and don’t tamper with any of the evidence,” he loudly proclaimed, trying his best to inspire confidence. “There is nothing to worry about!” he added that last part even though he himself didn’t believe it.

He stepped over a frayed “Welcome” mat badly battered by the elements, and pushed open the squeaky screen door. Even though it was just a screen door, he marvelled at just how well it worked at muffling out the wailing of the mother who had called him, Mrs. Morrison. Through the gossamer veil of dust particles floating in the air, he could see her as a vague shadow curled up in the fetal position on the couch along the wall. To the right of him, he could see another shadow, lying silently and unmovingly on one of the beds in a pool of blood.

“Police, ma’am,” he announced his arrival in a hoarse voice, but she didn’t pay him attention. After all, there was nothing he could do that could ease her pain. Even if he somehow immediately tracked down whoever was responsible, it still wouldn’t bring her girl back.

He walked forward into the bedroom, the floor creaking slightly under every careful step. The teenage girl lay there, partially undressed, the clothes peeled away from her upper body; however, Burt guessed that the crime that had taken place here was certainly not of a sexual nature, at the very least not exclusively. Too much of her was missing.

A faint fresh breeze brushed against his face, upheaving once more the stench of death in the room, which had just begun to settle like mud swirling in a puddle. He turned and noticed that the window in the room had been left open, no, not just open, but broken. The actual glass remained intact, and so did the lock holding the window to the frame, but the entire frame had been partially torn out of the paper-thin wall of the motor home, leaving a slightly jagged edge where the sheet metal simply gave way.

It then hit him all at once, and so much of him wanted to go and join Mrs. Morrison in her inconsolable wailing. What was he doing here? What was the point of all of this? He had seen death before, now especially since the collapse. But nothing could yet compare to this. Here was an innocent child, a little girl torn apart in her own home, not as a means to an end, but as an end in and of itself.

This was entirely a farcical “investigation,” and he would have to fight a continuous uphill battle to lie and convince not only the people around whom he had lived all his life, who depended on him, but also himself that he could find a solution to all this. There was only a handful of other officers among whom he held seniority, even though he was only technically a sergeant. Just one guy with a criminal justice bachelor's and the bare bones training provided by the police academy, whose years of experience consisted entirely of breaking up barfights and handing out speeding tickets, wandering around with a gun and badge. There had been a full department with a chief and a detective once, but that was long gone. There was no more “lab” which he could send evidence to for analysis, no more federal or even state authorities to assist with more investigators, and seemingly unlimited resources. He was almost entirely on his own, at least for right now, facing a crime the likes of which he had never seen in his life, much less career.

He nearly doubled over, but stopped himself at the last minute, bracing his arms on his knees, and everything seemed to swim in front of his eyes, vomit rising in the back of his throat. This was real, this was now, this was happening. Mrs. Morrison kept crying. The snow outside kept falling.

He reached into the pocket of his heavy winter coat, extracting a plastic bag with sterile rubber gloves. This was a job that needed doing. He had no other choice.

He found himself some time later, driving back in his patrol car, the Ford Explorer had seen better days, rattling over every single pothole like the bones of a groaning old man. There was little reason to maintain the roads since the only people who could afford gas were either local authorities or military, and then, there weren’t the resources even if they really wanted to. In the trunk, the body of Elisa Morrison, wrapped in a black plastic body bag, seemed to weigh like a metric ton, although it's doubtful that the rusted suspension actually felt any of that weight. 

He passed through the small town, which was his whole world, or whatever was left of it. It was situated in a valley with a small stream running through the center, and beside it stood a large stone building that in bygone years was once a watermill, dating back to the town’s very inception. All around it clustered a few little shops which formed the heart of Main Street, several of their once intricately illuminated facades either abandoned or partially boarded up. Just beyond them, however, stood the remains of the Industrial Revolution, hulking shells of bright orange brick buildings, making up warehouses, a factory, and even a small rail yard. The accompanying railway rolled into town from the north and passed away once again towards the south, invariably bending towards the horizon like a parallel line to the mountains, the rust turning it an identical shade of orange to the bricks of the rail yard. The rest of the buildings are nearly all little houses, of various years of construction, and in equally various states of disrepair. The only thing unified about them was how they seemed to huddle together, as if they were trying to protect each other from the winter cold.

He made a turn off Main Street and into the parking lot of a squat one-story building with small, bunker-like windows, the police station. One of the other officers, a young, lanky, pale kid by the name of Kody Gutherson, stepped out to meet him and helped carry Elisa Morrison indoors and downstairs into the tiny room that served as the morgue. Previously, before it all went to shit, the only “visitors” were drunk drivers and their victims, and on one rare occasion, one man who was stabbed in a bar fight. Now, however, the corpse of a brutally murdered teenage girl lay there, as if silently blaming Burt for failing to protect her, protect the community, and that this was all his fault.

“Radio over to John that I need his advice. Tell him I need him to be here as fast as he can make it,” he ordered Kody, who nodded and scrambled back upstairs to the radio. Soon enough, within twenty minutes, a loud knock was heard at the front door, and a short, aged man, with thinning gray hair and a pair of round glasses, bundled up in a puffy parka, stepped into the station. This was John, the local pharmacist, the closest person to a doctor in the town.

“What’s the matter, Mr. Harrison? Has there been a death?” John asked, catching his breath. 

“Yes.” Burt hoarsely replied, “I’d like you to take a look at her, see what stands out, but please… Don’t mention it to anyone. It wouldn’t be good for morale if word got out before I have anything to show for it.”

He led John down to the basement, where the pharmacist began to unzip the body bag. Burt couldn’t bear to look, but he still heard John audibly gasp in surprise, revulsion, and fear when the old man must have seen the bloody pulp of Elisa’s upper body. He sat there in the room for some time, staring down at the concrete floor below while John conducted a rough approximation of an autopsy.

“Judging by the rigor mortis, she died last night, maybe sometime around 2 or 3 AM. There are bruises on her arm, so that may likely be signs of a struggle in which she was simply overpowered, but there is no evidence of rape or sexual violence. However, I doubt that the perpetrator was a human, but rather an animal of sorts, as far as I’m able to tell, she was bitten and eaten to death with no other visible injuries that may suggest murder, perhaps a bear?” John delivered his analysis, jotting down all of his observations on a sheet of paper and handing it to Burt. “It would also be in line with… the injuries… that a bear would have gone for the face and neck and bust rather than the limbs.”

“Thanks, John, I really appreciate it,” Burt replied, still looking down at the floor. “I’ll look into that possibility.”  In a very twisted sense of hope, he wished that it was something as simple as a bear attack, and not the alternative. But he had his reasons to doubt that.

“No problem…” The little old man looked just as shaken as Burt. “I’ll have to be heading back now, but let me know if there are any new developments.”

“Will do, sir.” Burt nodded and escorted John back out.

As John left, Burt reached into the bag that he had brought with him and took out the small window screen that had been forcefully pushed in by the killer to allow entrance into the trailer. He had meticulously disassembled it so as not to damage it further. Laying it down on a small table in the corner of the room, he measured it with a tape measure… exactly 16 inches wide. Although he was no expert on bears, it was nearly impossible to conceive of any bear larger than a cub successfully making their way through such an opening and then back out again.

Carefully examining the screen with gloved hands, he reached down to his duty belt and pulled out his flashlight, which had a blacklight function built into it. Turning it on, he swept the beam across the edge of the bent white metal frame. Clear as day, there was a set of fingerprints there; he didn’t even really need the black light other than to bring out the detail in them, as they were outlined in small specks of Elisa’s blood.

This was human. 

He rose up the stairs and stepped outside, taking a momentary breath of fresh air to clear his mind. The snow had ceased falling for now, but the darkness had begun falling to replace it. Evening rolled in fast on these short winter days. The few meager lights of the town lit up one by one in the windows, each one like a tiny lighthouse amid a storm of darkness, whose waves topped with black pines instead of white froth came crashing down over and around them always, tirelessly seeking to snuff out the light. To wash away the last few remaining vestiges of human presence and plunge the world back into the primordial soup of insanity and natural chaos. And yet, the little bulbs, candles, and lamps still fearlessly clung on even as their numbers dwindled, day after day, month after month, and year after year.

It was too late to make any serious headway in the investigation today, but he had made a list for tomorrow to interview several of the people closest to Elisa. Although, of course, there were no jilted lovers, gambling “buddies”, or unhappy creditors in the life of this teenage girl, there may still be some juvenile squabble, bullying, or jealousy that may have motivated a peer into committing such an act. It seemed improbable to Burt, as he could not even begin to imagine a teen doing that to poor Elisa, he still had to try. It was better than nothing. Better than conceive, or rather lend any further credence to the theory that had been naggling at the back of his consciousness immediately after arriving at the scene. No, not here.

By now, another officer, a shorter but certainly solidly built man by the name of Bill, a good friend of many years, had come back dragging with him a handcuffed man whose face and build were obscured by his saggy jeans and bulky hoodie.

“What’s the charge?” Burt asked Bill as he rushed to help him escort the man into the small annex to the police station,  which was the jail.

“Attempted burglary, trespassing,” Bill grunted as they shoved the man into a jail cell and swung the door closed behind him. Here, coldly lit by fluorescent lights, Burt could make out the face of the man much better; it was gaunt and overgrown with a scraggly, bushy beard. His eyes were hollow, and pupils dilated; wherever he was, it was clearly not here, which would largely explain his seeming lack of resistance to both of them dragging him in here. “Caught his ass trying to break into old Mary-Beth’s pantry while she was at today’s service. Took me a while to run him down, and when I eventually did, he was ranting out of his mind about how the demons made him do it. At least he mellowed out now.” Bill finished, catching his breath.

“Fuck…” Burt exclaimed with a sigh. A brief wave of hope crashed over him, maybe this was it, the same methed out creep who also might’ve also killed Elisa? Maybe it was all over before it even began? But he didn’t really dare to hope. “They keep coming hard and fast, huh?”

“It's just how the times are.” Bill shrugged in response.

“I suppose they are,” Burt mumbled. “You got everything ready to book him? I’ll step out and get some sleep, be back in about nine hours. Keep an eye on him and don’t burn this place down in the meantime.” He told Bill, only half jokingly.

“I will.” Bill smiled, still unaware of the exact details of Elisa Morrison’s case.

 Burt stepped on over to the car, turned the key, and rolled off into the night, the yellow headlights sweeping over the snow-covered roads. He parked it in the parking lot of a building that to any stranger’s eye would have presented itself as a gloomy, half-abandoned warehouse, made of a similar set of large bricks, two stories high and complete with small recessed windows. The only thing that set it apart as an apartment building was the shoddy-looking wood, motel-like balcony that extended to the second floor. Rising up the staircase, he fished in his pockets for the keys and, after fumbling for a second, opened the door and found himself home. Maybe “home” was a little too strong a word, but this was relatively safe, simple, comfortable, and above all, warmed his soul just a little bit. The wood-paneled walls, evidently installed in either the 70s or 80s, had soaked up years of cheap cigarette smoke and steam from the Salisbury steaks of TV dinners, mixed it all together with the smell of aging pine and slowly radiating back out a distinct woody yet now familiar smell.

He added to it with tonight’s dinner consisting of two cans, one a cheap local brewed “beer”, the contents and alcohol content of which he wasn’t exactly sure of, but it did its job, and a can of Campbell’s of a suitable vintage for the main course. Afterwards, he grabbed a quick shower, changed into a new set of clothing, popped in a CD, and lay there on the bed listening to the soft sounds of the music. Before his eyes rushed a stream of memories, fears, and insecurities melding in with dreams as his eyelids closed. He opened his eyes to the ringing of his alarm, feeling as though he had just blinked. Time for work again.

He drove over to the high school, a relatively newly-built building, finished right before everything went to shit, complete with the school district’s pride and joy, a football field. All put together, it was a reassuring sight for Burt because deep inside, he wanted to believe that even up until the end, the plan for the future was bright and hopeful, that so many resources could be poured into such a grand investment for future generations. Although, hell, that didn’t matter now, did it? In fact, it made everything even more tragic in retrospect. By now, however, it had been adapted into the elementary, middle, and high school all in one, sort of like the reincarnation of those one-room schoolhouses from the days of the pioneers.

The principal was a woman by the name Elizabeth Polk, on whom the years clearly weighed quite heavily, and yet, despite this, she held herself together marvelously, her greying blonde hair swept back in an impressively tight ponytail. She stood there, in the office, her hands crossed over her chest, her posture so taught it was almost unnatural. Everything in her body visibly tensed as Burt recounted in general details the nature of the investigation thus far. He had guessed she might have heard of it already through the rumors that had undoubtedly spread around, but he wanted to reaffirm that she had all the correct information. Still, she remained stoic throughout it all, even though it affected her greatly, seeming to grow many years older with every word he spoke.

She didn’t seem to have any relevant information on Elisa Morrison. She called in her teacher, Mrs. Brittney Hull, however, and as soon as she walked in, Burt could see that the woman had already heard the news. Her eyes were red and huge, grey, and bags hung beneath them.

“I’m SergeantBurt Harrison, local police. I'm here to ask you a few questions about one of your students, Elisa Morrison. Unfortunately, she was found-” Burt began, but Mrs. Hull abruptly cut him off with a vigorous shaking of her head, letting out a barely audible whimper, making a great effort not to cry. “I’m sorry, ma’am, I’ll try to keep this short,” Burt spoke in acknowledgement. “But I need to know about any relationships or conflicts that Elisa may have had. How many friends did she have? What were her grades like?”

   “She… she was one of my best students…” Mrs. Hull began before having to pause to hold back a sob. “But she didn’t have very many friends, at least as far as I’m aware. She was best friends with another girl, Jill Brady. They were almost inseparable, but now with Elisa gone, Jill hasn’t shown up to school either.”

“So Jill isn’t in school either? When was the last time she was in attendance?” Burt asked, his attention piqued.

“Two days ago, the last day that Elisa was alive. Something seemed off, a disagreement of some sort between them, perhaps, I don’t know.” Mrs. Hull responded, thoughtfully trying to remember.

“But are you aware of any other incidents, maybe she was bullied by other classmates, teased, had rumors spread about her?” Burt asked, digging deeper.

“No, not that I’m aware of. She was always a loner, but she was never really picked on, got along quite well with everyone, but never really made friends with anyone else except Jill.” Mrs. Hull began, pausing and then quickly added on, “Oh, but there was one thing, just last week, there was actually a rumor going about that I happened to overhear, some of the other girls were gossiping that Elisa had a crush on Jill’s boyfriend, Hunter Dugan. Perhaps, that’s what they were arguing about just before…” she trailed off again, trying to contain herself. Burt could see that she blamed herself for not stepping in, for not getting involved, that somehow, something she could have done, if only she knew what, could have saved the girl.

“Thank you, that’s very helpful,” Burt said, nodding, and turned to the principal. “And, I suppose you have the addresses of Jill and Hunter on file, if I may have them?”

“Yes, we do,” she confirmed courtly, turned around, and after rifling through a cumbersome metal filing cabinet, dug out a paper, copied from it two names and addresses on a sticky note, and handed it to Burt. “I’m really sorry, but we only have one copy of the official records. You can always see it if you might need it again.”

“No issue, that’ll be sufficient. Thank you once again for your help, Mrs. Polk and Mrs. Hull. Try to have a nice day,” he said, getting up from the chair, taking the sticky note and giving the two women a small, polite bow, exited.

“Godspeed, sir!” he heard Mrs. Polk call out from behind him.

He drove off, heading over to Jill Brady’s house. He had already been well acquainted with her mother, Mrs. Ada Brady, who had a reputation for both her energy and eccentricity, especially true from the perspective of her neighbors. This conversation certainly wasn’t going to go well.

He drove his car through the snow, passing by several powder-covered street signs before he sighted the right one: Baker Avenue. It was an aged, one-story house backing out to the woods beyond, built in the 1950s, a leftover artifact from the era of universal post-WW2 optimism and prosperity. It had been kept up quite well, all things considered, with white plastic siding which blended in with the snow. Trudging over to the front door, he gave a loud knock against it, announcing himself. “Police!”

Mrs. Brady opened the door in just a minute. She was a small, frenzied-looking little woman, especially now as she was all wrapped up in a blanket over a fuzzy gown, with straight, jet black hair framing the tired, puffy features of her face. She already knew what he was going to ask her.

“You’re here about Elisa Morrison, aren't you?” she asked softly.

‘Yes, ma'am, ' he confirmed.

“Took you long enough. Come in,” she said, ushering him inside. The inside was an eclectic mess of various items, sensations, smells, and sights. She couldn’t quite be called a hoarder, yet it was all too messy. Mismatched rugs lined the scratched-up wood floor and hung from the walls, some with a Turkish or Asian design, the others with a distinctly Native American pattern. Books were lying about, some on shelves, the others stacked up against the corners like some sort of design statement. Among them numbered many different genres and authors, but quite a few of them featured titles on folklore, Wicca, and spiritualism from what he was able to catch at a glance. Scented candles and dirty mason jars filled with half-burned incense sticks stood in the center of a coffee table whose legs had been unmistakably thinned out by the teeth and claws of some of her little furry feline raptors. In a sense, a type of hippie-flavored organized chaos. “Please, have a seat,” she said, pointing at a well-worn couch.

“Thanks,” he nodded solemnly, carefully taking a seat just on the edge. “I’ve heard your daughter was very good friends with Elisa. May I ask how she’s taking the news?”

“Very poorly… As soon as she heard about what happened, she locked herself in her room. She’s barely come out other than to eat, drink, and use the bathroom. In fact, just last night she fell really, really ill, very high fever, nausea, and she’s been in bed ever since, with me taking care of her. “ Mrs. Brady explained, looking down at the floor with a deeply worried expression. “It’s…It’s not even the flu, I don’t think… Just something brought on by a total mental and physical collapse…Oh my poor girl.”

“Would it be possible for me to see her and talk to her?” Burt asked, looking at her with sympathy.

“No, I’m afraid not. She was just throwing up really badly this morning, and I just got her to take some medicine to take the fever down a few degrees, just enough for her to sleep.” Mrs. Brady shook her head. “She needs her rest.”

“I suppose so,” he reluctantly agreed. “But in that case, could you tell me if your daughter spoke to you about anything regarding Elisa before the murder?”

“Are you really implying that my angel had anything to do with it?” she spoke in a hushed tone, and her small frame quickly became full of animated fury. “How dare you! I thought you had come here with a real breakthrough in the case, so I could soothe my child’s broken heart, and instead, you come here and blame her? I knew you pigs were never good for anything!” she spilled her tirade at him, but still quiet enough not to risk waking her daughter.

“Maam, maam, I’m just trying to gather information…” he said as calmly as possible, trying to reassure her. I’m not blaming your daughter, but if perhaps Elisa was killed by a peer over some drama at school, your daughter may be the only person with any real insight into the matter, given how close she was with her.” He watched the anger slowly slip from Mrs. Brady’s face over the course of a tense few moments.

“Hmm, she didn’t speak much of Elisa to me recently,” she finally said, regaining her composure, “But she did go out to a party just the night before…it happened… It was Elisa, my daughter, and her boyfriend, Hunter.”

“And when exactly was this?” Burt asked, writing down the details of the testimony in his notepad.

“This was two days ago, exactly the night of the murder. Hunter came by at around eight, picked up my Jill, and they went to get Elisa as well. Jill came back before eleven, just how I told her to be, and then she was so tired she went straight to bed.” Mrs. Brady recounted, trying to recall all of the details.

“Thank you, then, that would be all,” he said, getting up from the couch.

“And one more thing…” she said, and he could see it in her face that she was conflicted as to whether or not to tell him. “I don’t think you’re going to find the person responsible. I’ve felt a bad presence around our town for the past week, the kind that wasn’t there before. Dark energy. This is not the work of living men but the work of a vengeful, angry spirit, the Wendigo, come to take revenge on our town. It is the fault of white men who brought this evil on us, who stole this land. You won’t find anyone! Only through belief and prayer to the natives to whom this land truly belongs can we be saved,” she ranted to him. In return, he stopped, thinking over her words.

“With all due respect, Mrs., no spirits came to help the natives in their time of need when Old Hickory sent them off, so why would any be here now? The actions of very real bad men are much more real and dangerous than any evil native ghosts. I promise, I’ll do everything in my power to come back here and deliver the news that we’ve caught the bastard responsible as soon as I can. Good day,” he said and walked back out into the snow.

His next step was that Hunter Dugan character. His address brought Burt to an interesting sight. It was a larger, two-story house, considerably newer and much more opulent than many of the others, and yet still somehow worse for wear. A relatively new, large, lifted, and unmistakably broken-down SUV stood parked in the driveway, with a faded “thin blue line” sticker still partly visible on the rear window. He knocked on the door and announced himself, and within a few minutes, a balding middle-aged man with a beard that was short yet patchy opened the door.

“Mr. Dugan, I presume? I’m Sergeant Burt Harrison, local police, and I’d like to ask your son a few questions…” Burt began.

“Oh, what has that…” Mr Dugan caught himself before swearing, “What has he gotten himself into now?”

“It’s about Elisa Morrison, the girl who was found murdered yesterday. Reportedly, your son was one of the last people to see her alive, so I’d like to ask him a few questions.” Burt stated calmly yet confidently, “May I come in?”

“Not without a warrant, you can’t!” Mr. Dugan rejected outright, “Stand here and I’ll bring his sorry ass out here.” And surely, within five minutes, there on the porch stood a tall yet scrawny young man, brown hair swept upwards in a fringe that could double as the brim of a baseball cap. He looked like the type that girls his age would swoon over, complete with a very sharp jawline. However, despite his handsome appearance, there was something about him, perhaps it was just because he got called out into the cold to be interrogated by a police officer, but there was something in his eyes, some hard-to-describe squirrely quality to them.

“Hunter Dugan?” Burt asked, trying to confirm the young man’s identity.

“Yes, sir,” Hunter replied nervously, trying to sound polite.

“When was the last time you saw Elisa Morrison?” Burt asked, carefully studying him.

“Just two days ago, we… I mean, Julia, Elisa, and I were going to a party on 4th Street. Afterwards, we parted ways and Elisa went back home by herself.” Hunter began to recount. In this case, “party” almost certainly meant sitting around somebody’s fire pit smoking or doing some sort of drugs, but now was not the time to press the issue, at least not yet. Still, Burt couldn’t help but think to himself that, of all the things to suffer supply shortages, drugs weren’t one of them.

“Was it your idea to attend the party?” he asked the boy, gauging his reaction.

“I dunno…” Hunter shrugged, “We all thought it be kind of fun, I guess.”

“And Elisa, did she walk back by herself?” he questioned him, “And you didn’t think to be a gentleman and at least walk her back to her home? It's not far from here after all.”

“Well… I also had to take Julia back to her place after all, and that was in the opposite direction…” Hunter stammered, “Well, I just didn’t think of it, I’m sorry.”

“Well, it ain’t me you have to apologize to, I’m afraid,” Burt responded dryly. “And at what time did you get back?”

“About midnight,” he admitted.

“And during the party, did you notice any arguments, disagreements perhaps with Elisa? Was she acting unusually?” Burt asked, although he guessed that someone like Hunter was almost certainly helpless at being able to understand body language or other forms of non-verbal communication unless they were blatantly obvious.

“No, not that I can remember,” the young man said and shook his head, and yet Burt noticed, albeit briefly, Hunter’s eyes darted to the side, avoiding eye contact with him as if he was even just visually trying to dive into the snow and eject himself from this conversation.

“Very well, thank you for your time and cooperation.” Burt nodded and headed off again. He sat in his car for some time, watching as Hunter headed back indoors, and through the windows, he could barely make out the shapes of him and his parents arguing. He compared his notes, Hunter’s testimony to Mrs. Brady’s. Jill had supposedly gotten home at just around eleven, while it took Hunter another hour to make what should have been a ten-minute walk. A suspicion began to brew in his mind, but still, it was yet unfounded. Turning over the ignition, he drove back off to the Morrisons’.

Mrs. Morrison’s home looked just the same as it had when he was there a day ago. A small camping lamp now illuminated the trailer, shedding light on the mess that had been lying around since yesterday. Dirty clothing, blankets, and more heaps of stuff, which Burt couldn’t quite identify, lay thrown about on the floor. Mrs. Morrison had not been able to find the strength in herself to clean up, and he couldn’t blame her. She looked at him from the semi-darkness, eyes wet and red.

“Any news?” she spoke in an almost whisper.

“No, unfortunately, not yet, but I’m putting together a timeline of events,” Burt explained. “Can you remember what time Elisa got back from the party that night?”

“Quarter to midnight or so.” Mrs. Morrison spoke, recalling the time, “I was so mad at her then, but she was so happy, just beaming, oh god, why did I have to be mad at her? Why couldn’t I just have hugged her and told her that I loved her over and over again? I’m so sorry, my baby, I’m so sorry…” she burst into tears once again. Burt sat there, silently. What could he even say? Should he try to reassure her, to tell her that he’s going to catch the person responsible, even if he didn’t even believe that himself? And even if he did, what good would it do to her? Would she even care? Nothing now would bring Elisa back.

“My condolences, once more,” he rasped and then fell silent for some time before speaking again. “We’ll take care of the funeral. Would you like any arrangements done in regard to the church, plot, or date of the burial?” There wasn’t much else he could do with the body. He didn’t have the equipment or expertise to conduct a further, more in-depth autopsy, and the room where her body was kept was cooled but not actually refrigerated, and decay was going to get rid of all of the remaining evidence anyway.

“Tomorrow, at the Lutheran Church on Willow Street. I have a plot there, but I never thought it would be for her…” Tears streamed down her face again. “I want her to be next to her dad.”

She buried her head into his shoulder and cried for a while, until it simply turned into long, deep, sorrowful sobs like a person drowning. And drowning she was, drowning perhaps in despair and hopelessness, drowning because there could be no more surfacing for a breath of fresh air from this. Burt sat there, with an arm around her half-heartedly, staring off into space, watching little bits of dust float by, hearing a fly buzz as it slammed itself head first into one of the windows over and over again, its destination so close yet impossibly far. He smelled the decaying linoleum, the rotting plywood, the rusting sheet metal of the walls. He knew he had to say something, do something, to stop the inevitable, and it tore his heart into shreds knowing that he couldn’t. Elisa would be buried, but this, this corroding bucket would become her mother’s tomb. There was nothing else left for her here.

After Mrs. Morrison had cried herself to sleep on his shoulder, he got up carefully and draped a blanket over her, letting her lie on the couch before getting up and walking out, closing the door behind him. He had Elisa’s body wrapped up and moved over to the church, where they would place her in what casket they could. After that was out of Burt’s control, he concentrated his attention back to the facts of the case. He had investigated what leads he could, and the only thing they’d definitively revealed to him was the inconsistency of the claimed times that each of the teens reportedly had gotten back from the party.

To him, Hunter seemed the most suspicious, but even then, for what? Some disjointed facts and nervous glances? Surely that wasn’t enough to issue a warrant over, and even if he got one, what would he find? A baggie of weed and a bong under his bed, right next to his crusty sock? What was he actually looking for?

1m4ql1a,https://www.reddit.com/r/TestedAtHome/comments/1m4ql1a/what_makes_the_vinci_express_cold_brew_coffee/,What Makes the VINCI Express Cold Brew Coffee Maker So Unique?,"Testing out the Vinci E23010 has been an intriguing experience for someone like me who thrives on caffeine and convenience. As someone perpetually running late in the mornings, this compact cold brew coffee maker felt like a game-changer from the get-go. With promises to create cold brew in mere minutes instead of the traditional 12-24-hour grind, I had high hopes for this device—and I wasn’t entirely disappointed, though it's worth mentioning a few quirks along the way.

**Design and Build Quality**

The sleek, modern look of the Vinci E23010 immediately caught my eye. Its clear glass carafe paired with black accents makes it a visually appealing addition to any kitchen counter. Measuring 7 inches deep, 4 inches wide, and 12 inches tall, it fits snugly in compact spaces without being intrusive. Despite its relatively lightweight build, clocking in at just over 3 pounds, the machine feels sturdy. The 1.1-liter capacity is neither too small nor overly large, hitting a sweet spot for personal or small household use.

Taking the Vinci out of the box felt like unwrapping a gadget that was thoughtfully designed. I appreciated the inclusion of a reusable filter and a cleaning cup, which brought the whole setup closer to idiot-proof. My coworker, who is notably unkind to appliances, even admitted it seemed hard to break unintentionally.

**Ease of Use**

The user interface is straightforward, relying on a combination of dials and buttons that even the sleepiest coffee enthusiast could navigate. Setting the brew strength is as easy as turning the dial to one of the four options: Light (5 minutes), Medium (10 minutes), Bold (15 minutes), or Extra Bold (25 minutes). I tried all four settings over a few days to see if the flavor profiles varied—and lo and behold, they did.

While you’re technically brewing coffee, the whole process feels more like letting a gadget do most of the work. All I had to do was fill the reservoir with water, dump in some ground coffee, and press start. Easy as pie, especially for a Monday morning. The automatic cleaning feature quickly became one of my favorite perks—pressing a button that flushes the residual coffee and rinses everything for you feels incredibly luxurious if you’ve ever had to scrub grounds out of a cold brew pitcher.

**Key Benefits**

- Accelerates cold brew preparation time to minutes instead of hours or days.  
- Four customizable brew strengths provide versatility to suit varying tastes.  
- The integrated self-cleaning feature lowers the hassle of manual maintenance.

**Performance and Taste**

I was skeptical about the claim of ""smooth, clean, and virtually sediment-free"" coffee. Skepticism faded after the first batch. Unlike traditional cold brews that sometimes settle with gritty residue at the bottom, Vinci's Circle Flow brewing technology delivered a surprisingly sediment-free glass each time. The bold and extra-bold options packed a punch without overwhelming the taste buds, offering a richness that even my picky neighbor could appreciate.

The coffee stores well, too. I brewed a batch, sealed it with the storage lid, and kept it in the fridge for six days. The flavor remained fresh, which saved my energy on busy mornings where prepping coffee felt like a Herculean effort. However, for a richer experience, I suggest consuming within the first couple of days.

**Downsides**

- Brew intensity can feel too mild for those who prefer traditional cold brew steeped overnight.  
- Slight learning curve for perfectly tweaking coffee-to-water ratios with certain brands of coffee grounds.  
- Relatively loud operation during brewing may disturb quieter households.  

**Competing Products**

As I tested the Vinci, I couldn’t help but compare it to other cold brew systems. Compared to the Toddy Cold Brew System, Vinci wins on speed but falls short in extraction depth when aiming for a distinctly robust flavor. Manual systems like the Takeya Cold Brew Maker feel more old-school and lack the Vinci’s automatic perks, like the self-cleaning function. Meanwhile, KitchenAid's Cold Brew Coffee Maker offers a sleeker stainless-steel build but comes at a steeper price point.

Where the Vinci truly excels is in its convenience. For cluttered counters and busy schedules, it’s hard to beat the simplicity of an electric cold brew appliance.

**Smart Spending**

Priced competitively against premium cold brew systems, the Vinci offers excellent automation and convenience without logic-defying costs. While it’s not bargain-basement cheap, the features packed into this device justify the slightly higher buy-in compared to simpler, manual systems. If you’re someone who values time over tradition, it’s well worth the investment.

This is more for me than anyone else, a way to process what's been happening, and maybe one day, it can help someone else who finds themselves in a similar situation.

I wish I could say I'm spending every moment dissecting my past with F****, trying to figure out where it all went wrong. I know he might expect me to be heartbroken, destroyed, and consumed by the loss, hoping I'd never find happiness or love again because of his perceived wrongdoings. I know he's not as blind as I've been acting like he is, and frankly, he's far more complicit than he's ever admitted – something I know he's not capable of acknowledging. He always claimed I lacked accountability, but these past months have been a crash course in taking responsibility for what I did, what was perceived, and outright lies. Let me be clear: I am not making excuses for my actions. I am giving the full, necessary context that nobody seems to be considering. This isn't even everything; this is just a fucking SparkNotes of the shit we went through together, that we put each other through.

But I'm not heartbroken in the way he might imagine. And I'm not saying that to be cruel. I had to move through that quickly. I had to grow, to move on fast because of the situation I was in. That doesn't mean I don't still reminisce; I wouldn't be here posting if I didn't. But the truth is, my life has progressed far beyond what F**** knows, even with the ongoing sneakiness from him and his friends.

Honestly, I don't know if F**** will ever be able to hear these truths, but he needs to. He knows them, and if he doesn't, he's ignorant. He was a part of the problem. He was the crux of every issue we had, even very early on. He once said, ""Even when there's proof, I don't believe it."" How was I ever going to compare to that? It started out with me wanting to prove to him that he was worth being loved because he made it seem like he didn't think he was. And it turned into me proving that I loved him, and then that I was worthy of love. Fuck that. He backed the wrong conceptual horse, guys. Life, love, relationships—they're fucked. They're two-sided, just like every one of you, just like me and him. Congrats! I'm not a good guy if that's what you all needed to hear, or we can go home now.

F**** was good at compartmentalizing. Every facet of his life – his friends, his family, his co-workers – they all didn't know shit about each other, more than he wanted them to know. So to them, I'm the bad guy. But I'm pretty sure they're not dumb enough to think that every guy he dates is the problem. Maybe they are.

It doesn't make sense, does it? That even after all the harm and exposure F**** and his friends inflicted, people are still so connected and supportive of me. I know that infuriates them, because it shows there's more to me than they think, that I'm not just an ""asshole."" And for F**** to think that line would ever work on me is truly embarrassing. It means he understood nothing. When I said he treated me like property, that wasn't a reflection on me; I never thought I was property. That was a reflection on his idiotic perspective, and it's exactly why I ended up doing what I did. The fact that he used that to gain leverage over me, and he still thinks it was all me... My mind is all over the place, talking to so many different people in this mess. It's been worse since I lost my health insurance again. This whole situation is just eating me up from the inside, and today, the pain is truly unbearable.

Honestly, I hope they didn't see this as a successful campaign. Don't get me wrong, my life was awful for a time because of the position F**** and I left me in. But I was still finding moments of fun. And honestly, I wasn't living the worst days of my life – those were lived with him, when he was doing things he probably never owned up to.

For F**** and his friends to think they're doing something noble or whatever that was? What was that? I hope I don't die without someone trying to explain what the fuck that was all about. It was so fucking weird. How many people does it take to try and intimidate one person? What was the goal? And how are they so stupid to keep doing it when it's all highly recorded and witnessed? The sheer idiocy of it all is baffling.

F**** probably believes he's the only one left who can't believe and love, who can't trust, who can't find joy in the little things anymore. Yet, I stepped into this with nothing but raw faith and belief that he, that we, could actually have a fairytale ending. I gave him access to everything, everyone, and I didn't look back. I lost family because I openly loved him. He felt like the first man I'd truly known, and in that, every past relationship faded. That loss of connection with my family? It doesn't even matter to me. It wasn't his problem; it was theirs. I didn't give a shit then, and I don't give a shit now, because I chose him. Over and over and over again. I also promised I liked his family, he knew that. Each time he'd get mad at me for things that actually didn't happen, and we'd break up, and I didn't want to jump back into getting involved with his family. I wanted us to focus on each other first. He'd get mad and say I can't be with someone who doesn't want to be around my family. Not understanding that I was literally losing my family, and I didn't want to have to build more with my issues and get attached to his family, just to fear losing them – even though that's exactly what happened and that's exactly what kept happening. I wouldn't go and shake his family and be like, ""He's doing this to us."" I'd let them believe whatever the fuck he told them. And I trusted him each time he spoke, not fully seeing the subtle threads of manipulation weaving through his words.

He even had this belief that every one of my friends just wanted to fuck me, which became another cage. I actually stopped hanging out with my friends because of it. And so, in a misguided attempt to prove my loyalty, I gave him access to everything – my location, my messages, whatever he wanted. I meant it as a way to say, ""Here, you can trust me. Let's do this for a little bit."" But he went psychotic with it. Six months in, and with his own issues making things worse, it became a weapon against me.

Cheating, for me, has always been a devastating earthquake. It absolutely ruined my life, it's the reason my mother, who was dying, gave up. I found myself living with my stepfather and the woman he was cheating on my dying mother with. He cheated on her, and guess who was kicked out? Me. So, yes, cheating has repeatedly scorched my life. And I am not claiming to be a victim, because I could have left. I should have left. I should have fucking left, because he was a piece of shit to me.

But I believed in the better version of him, the man he claimed he was striving to be. He begged me not to leave, crying, pleading with me not to give up, promising he would get it right. Tell me, at what point did he get it right? Was it before or after I had to beg him, countless times, to simply try and get to know me? Was it before or after he managed to taint nearly every visit I made to my family or friends? Every single time.

He accused me of trying to engage with my own cousin because my cousin invited me, him, and his best friend to relax in his jacuzzi. This is the same man who, on a night I confessed suicidal thoughts and begged not to be left alone, told me it wasn't his problem and went to sleep. I was calling and texting him updates all night, trying to stay connected, fighting for my life. Only to find out later he acted like he had no idea where I was, thought I was dead, even played out a missing person scenario with my friend, searching drug places. Instead of doing what I explicitly told him I was going to do – going to Kaiser. Why the fuck would they do that instead of just going to Kaiser? I was sitting in a behavioral health center, dreaming of hugging him one more time, while he was out there, wandering through places I'd never be.

So please tell me, how would you feel, fighting for your very life, for a guy who just rolled over and went to sleep? A guy who wouldn't even answer his phone, who probably blocked me. That's the only reason he might claim he didn't know I was at Kaiser – because those of you who know are going to tell me he knew and willingly didn't tell anyone? That means he was just trying to save face when people called him out and asked, ""Hey, where's K*?""

But please, tell me I'm a fucking asshole because I sought affection elsewhere, or because I started doing drugs again, wanting to scream ""fuck you"" at him for the shit he said. I lost my family from a situation that originated from something he created, and while I was going through the depression of that, he would judge me and get upset and call me lazy when the two kids I spent my life caring for stopped talking to me. It was a profoundly difficult time. He was not a supportive partner.

I was also on the move with my job, making significant progress, which was evident every time I secured gigs for him at the places I was working with. It still makes no sense why he thought I was out fucking people when I was out there doing my job, getting contacts, securing clients, and getting him gigs at the facilities I was working at. But I ended up leaving two jobs because of the pressure he put on me. This wasn't entirely on him, as I had ongoing living situation issues and problems with management, but he was the biggest screaming factor. Every day I'd come home to accusations, even if I didn't pick up the phone when he called me once. That was another thing: if I didn't pick up the phone or call him back within two minutes, he'd think I was cheating on him. It was insane. He could call me whenever, and if I didn't answer, I was cheating on him. I was a fucking prisoner. Being told I was one way until finally I became that one way.

I'm sure he told his friends he ""showed up for me when no one else did"" at a court appointment. When he did show up, it felt like it was only to save face. Did he tell them all the times he didn't show up for me? He claims I put hands on him first? If we're going with that lie, I guess he didn't push me when we were in LA, didn't jump into my car and drive off drunk in San Diego. The situations speak for themselves.

And that incident? That was because he seemingly couldn't fathom my friends knowing we were boyfriends. My community wasn't outwardly ""open,"" but my people love me. For him to think I would go down there and do something like that was a complete betrayal of trust, especially after my friends had done some of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me. They didn't even fucking bat an eye at our relationship. But I guess ""coming out"" is supposed to be a grand spectacle for everybody. When you grow up hearing you'll be beaten up, made fun of, and outcast – their reaction meant everything. But again, instead of trusting me, he let his own demons win.

And the first time I ""put hands on him,"" he had just finished spewing the most fucked up shit to me because I posted a meme about wanting forehead kisses, even as a ""manly man."" He assumed I was asking strangers for kisses instead of talking about him, or just generally. We'd just left his friend's house after a really good night, and he absolutely exploded, saying the most horrific things about me, my family, my life. He threw a bag at me first, and what I did was grab him to try and shake some sense into him, and he pushed me back. That's when that ""physical"" part happened. And I never once, when I got physical with him, wanted to actually hurt him. When he got physical with me, he seemed to try and inflict pain and damage.

I hung myself in that room. I don't know how I'm alive still. I still don't. I still have pain in my neck from it. I'm shaking thinking about it. I really should not be here. Did he even give a shit? I know that's the kind of fucking position he put me in. Framing my pain, my struggle, my loneliness, and my abandonment issues as ""me abusing him,"" when all I wanted was for him to show me he loved me, and he couldn't even do that.

So while I was still sitting there, waiting for him to become the man he begged me to wait for, I wanted some fucking attention, some fucking thing to numb my pain. I guess some part of me wanted a way to get back at the hurt he'd inflicted. That doesn't make any of this okay. This whole situation is fucked up, and we wouldn't be in this situation had he done what I fucking said in the very beginning, when he accused me of cheating on him while he flew out to stay with a friend he had slept with before. But I was ""cheating"" because I trimmed my body hair – trimmed it for fucking summer. And he went to stay with someone he had slept with, and I told him that guy was giving me dirty looks. ""No, he's not,"" he said, even though his own friend called him out for it. But I'm still the fucking asshole. This guy had been fucking around with people the entire fucking time. You fucking know that but I'm the bad guy.

So no, I'm not wasting my time feeling bad for him. It sucks, and I shouldn't have done it, yes. But I can't feel bad for a guy who treated me like that. A guy who sent people after me, knowing I could just destroy him, but also knowing I wouldn't. Because I actually loved the fuck. For some fucking reason, I still hope that guy is in there. Not for me. But for him. Because when he was that guy, he fucking shined. He was worthy of my love. But now he's just the fucking reality check that m echo play the next song y financially and emotionally can't cash.

I'm starting to go out again, which is incredibly difficult for me, and people are so caught up in that relationship. I know I haven't given answers, but for me, I haven't been focused on that. Yes, he's on my mind, and I miss him, but he's not here. He's not fixing anything, because how do you fix that? What is there to fix? I'm broken forever. I'm not fighting the urge to text him. I'm fighting the urge not to be the bad person I want to be every fucking second of the day. I'm fighting the urge for a lot. But we didn't work. I'm moving on because I have no other fucking choice. I know there are going to be some weird fucking people who, for some reason, will continue to be interested. I've chosen to share this for my own peace and clarity, not to provoke or engage in further conflict. My life is about moving forward.

The New York Mets (-130) take on the Cincinnati Reds (+110) in a matchup that’s less ""thrilling"" and more ""let’s see who can blink first."" Here’s the lowdown, served with a side of statistical sarcasm.

**Why the Mets Should Win (Probably):**

* **David Peterson** (Mets’ starter) has a 3.61 ERA this season. That’s not great, but it’s *slightly* better than the Reds’ Andrew Abbott’s 2.23 ERA. Wait, no—Abbott’s the underdog? That’s like asking a snail to race a cheetah.
* The Mets are 14th in scoring (4.4 R/G) but 4th in pitching (3.61 ERA). They’re the baseball version of a team that only wins when the other side’s offense takes a coffee break.
* The Reds are 10th in runs scored (449 total) but 26th in ERA (5.12). They’re like a dessert menu that’s all calories and no flavor.

**Why the Reds Might Shock Us (Probably Not):**

* Abbott, the Reds’ starter, has a 2.23 ERA. That’s impressive… until you realize the Mets’ lineup includes **Pete Alonso** (25 HRs this season) and **Juan Soto** (32 HRs). Abbott’s a brave man. Or a

I've transformed mine into a functional workspace, and I want to share my experience with you.

I used to think I needed a dedicated desk, but my small apartment forced me to get creative. My coffee table has become my go-to spot for both relaxation and work. The key is choosing the right one. I found some great options here: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Here's what I learned about making a coffee table work as a workspace:

Height Matters
Standard coffee tables are usually 16-18 inches high, which can be uncomfortable for long work sessions. I recommend looking for one that's slightly taller (around 20-22 inches) if you plan to work there regularly. Many modern coffee tables come with adjustable heights, which is perfect for this dual purpose.

Storage is Essential
The best coffee tables for workspace conversion have built-in storage. I keep my laptop, chargers, and work supplies in mine, making it easy to switch between work and relaxation mode. Look for tables with drawers or lift-top designs.

Surface Area Considerations
You'll want enough space for your laptop, mouse, and maybe a notebook. I found that rectangular tables around 40 inches long work best. Some tables even have expandable surfaces or nesting designs that provide extra space when needed.

Material Choice
I learned this the hard way - some materials show scratches and wear more than others. Wood veneer and solid wood hold up well, while glass tops show every fingerprint. If you're interested in exploring different materials and styles, check out these options: https://explorehomedeals.com/coffee-tables

Smart Features
Many modern coffee tables come with built-in USB ports and power outlets. This has been a game-changer for me, eliminating the need to run cables across the room.

Ergonomic Tips:
- Use cushions on your couch or chair to adjust your sitting height
- Consider a laptop stand for better screen positioning
- Take regular breaks to stretch
- Keep good posture even when working from a coffee table

The best part about this setup is its versatility. When work's done, just store everything away, and you've got your living room back. It's perfect for small spaces or anyone who wants to maximize their furniture's functionality.

I've found this solution particularly useful during video calls - the living room lighting is usually better than other parts of my home, and the background looks more professional than a bedroom setting.

Remember, while a coffee table can work great as a temporary workspace, it's important to set it up properly to avoid strain or discomfort. The right table makes all the difference.",1,1753022375.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

1m4qivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/askphilosophy/comments/1m4qivj/how_do_determinists_know_that_thoughts_are/,How do determinists know that thoughts are deterministic?,"I agree with determinists for the most part - an object can’t be moved unless something else causes it to move, an event must be caused by a prior event - this is undeniable on a physical level.

But some determinists take that to mean that we definitely have no free will. I’m not saying they’re wrong, but how do they know they’re right? How do we know that the exact nature of our thoughts is determined by a one-to-one, cause and effect type of interaction with physical matter? Did the arrangement of atoms in the universe necessarily imply that I chose coffee instead of tea this morning, and my idea of “will” is just an illusion?

I know this might come across like a god-of-the-gaps argument, but I’m not saying they’re definitely wrong. It just doesn’t really make sense to me and it seems like they’re assuming things they couldn’t possibly know, since we don’t really understand how thoughts and consciousness, or even brains, actually work. “We’ve always observed B to be caused by A, so that must be the case universally” seems like bad philosophy to me.",2,1753022319.0,askphilosophy,3,1.0,False
1m4qi0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/carnivorediet/comments/1m4qi0g/beginner/,Beginner!,"I have a few questions that will be defined at the end. I am on day 5 of carnivore diet! I am still not perfect yet and would love to be more strict. At the moment I still eat Greek yogurt and chex mix. The chex mix was a snack in my house I still had prior to starting and just bought. My main temptation is sugar (pastries, ice cream, cake, sugar coffees, candy, processed snacks.) And I eat a bunch of sugar as a stress response to work, life. The salty food such as crackers have never been an issue for me. This past weekend I was intermittent fasting OMAD Friday and Saturday. Due to this eating the chex mix snack did not pull me out of ketosis. Even while eating nearly 50 grams of carbs. 

My main reason for starting carnivore is to have a better relationship with food and be more in control of my mind and emotions. Losing weight comes after those goals. 

Questions are;
1. Can I continue to eat the chex mix until they are gone. Or should I get rid of them asap. How badly will eating them for a few days ruin the process?
2. WOMEN. I am about to enter luteal phase, as of now I have not craved sugar. But I am worried that it can change if something stressful happens at work during my luteal phase. Should I prepare a carnivore cheesecake in case of temptation arising or should I ride out the storm and try and push through it with no sugar (even alternative).
OR has being on the diet for a few days begin to already help reduce the cravings. What did you experience when you first started? ",0,1753022258.0,carnivorediet,6,0.5,False

1m4qhio,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1m4qhio/when_the_mountains_hungerpart_1/,When the Mountains Hunger-Part 1,"The snow kept falling, coating the pinnacles and slopes of the Appalachians in a thick, white, powdery coat, from which only the jagged peaks of leafless trees or twisted evergreens protruded like sickly teeth arrayed upon a corpse's decayed, pale jaw.

Burt padded himself down as he exited the building that passed for a police station. The badge was still there, the sharp pin biting at his chest. He remembered times in his life when that badge seemed to weigh so, so heavy, but none as bad as now. He remembered protests, people carrying signs demanding justice over every real or perceived breach of justice or excessive force employed by a police officer, and how common they seemed to get in those later years, how their words at times enflamed both shame and anger in his heart, so that in the early mornings when he would have to crawl out of bed and go to work, he could barely find the motivation to do so. Life seemed terrible then, but he would trade places with his past self in a heartbeat.

Next, his hand fell to the comforting grip of the gun on his hip, a .38 revolver, old school. A Glock had been his constant companion for many years, but obviously it had become very difficult to source parts for it, so that when the slide had cracked one fateful day, he had no choice but to replace it. He was just thankful it happened while on the range and not when he really needed it, although he had never had to fire a gun in the line of duty as a cop before.

He looked back up at the mountains, towering overhead as he made his way with some difficulty through the snow towards his patrol car. The chill wind whistled between the mountains, carrying off whatever tidings it bore southward, down the very mountain ridge which stretched from the Maine Republic to what was once Georgia. Maybe things were going better down there; he doubted it, but he could only hope. 

These same mountains had seen it all. They had seen continents rise out from under the briny deep and seen them crack asunder. They had withstood the millennia-long sieges of glaciers and stood victorious. They still remembered the ancient tales and stories of the Native Americans that had passed from truths exposed by chiefs and shamans to the whispers that dying, decrepit elders took with them into the afterlife, with none around left to pass them on. The mountains had watched the star-spangled banner rise and reign across the continent, and just the same, they had laughed as the eagle, inevitably, lost its wings. He himself was born here, raised here, and would eventually die here. His body and his mind would once more then return to the native rock from which it was hewn and would rejoin the unending, mycelial memory of those snowy, unfeeling peaks.

As he reached the patrol car, something howled in the distance, and the sound was carried, amplified, and echoed by the slopes, almost as if it were a cold, dry laugh. It was time to go to work.

He drove down the winding, yet familiar, serpentine roads, finally reaching his destination: a dilapidated trailer home, nestled amid a grove of dead trees, neighbored by other similar dwellings. 

“This trailer park was once full of people, surviving day by day, working dead-end jobs they hated for meager pay. I wonder how many of them are left…” he grimly thought to himself. “How many of those small little dwellings, with broken blinds, peeling paint and the whole structure slightly tilting to one side were the result of a person still holding on even though the hope for a better life had long since vanished for them, or were the only inhabitants of these trailers the corpses of people who simply never woke one day, or worse, and lacked anyone else in this world to even notice...”

However, the trailer he was here for had already gathered a small crowd of curious onlookers, mainly men, clutching what guns or weapons they had while their wives and children peered at the scene from yellowed and dirty windows.

“Let’s disperse folks, let’s disperse… This is a police matter now. I’ll handle this quicker if you go back to your homes and don’t tamper with any of the evidence,” he loudly proclaimed, trying his best to inspire confidence. “There is nothing to worry about!” he added that last part even though he himself didn’t believe it.

He stepped over a frayed “Welcome” mat badly battered by the elements, and pushed open the squeaky screen door. Even though it was just a screen door, he marvelled at just how well it worked at muffling out the wailing of the mother who had called him, Mrs. Morrison. Through the gossamer veil of dust particles floating in the air, he could see her as a vague shadow curled up in the fetal position on the couch along the wall. To the right of him, he could see another shadow, lying silently and unmovingly on one of the beds in a pool of blood.

“Police, ma’am,” he announced his arrival in a hoarse voice, but she didn’t pay him attention. After all, there was nothing he could do that could ease her pain. Even if he somehow immediately tracked down whoever was responsible, it still wouldn’t bring her girl back.

He walked forward into the bedroom, the floor creaking slightly under every careful step. The teenage girl lay there, partially undressed, the clothes peeled away from her upper body; however, Burt guessed that the crime that had taken place here was certainly not of a sexual nature, at the very least not exclusively. Too much of her was missing.

A faint fresh breeze brushed against his face, upheaving once more the stench of death in the room, which had just begun to settle like mud swirling in a puddle. He turned and noticed that the window in the room had been left open, no, not just open, but broken. The actual glass remained intact, and so did the lock holding the window to the frame, but the entire frame had been partially torn out of the paper-thin wall of the motor home, leaving a slightly jagged edge where the sheet metal simply gave way.

It then hit him all at once, and so much of him wanted to go and join Mrs. Morrison in her inconsolable wailing. What was he doing here? What was the point of all of this? He had seen death before, now especially since the collapse. But nothing could yet compare to this. Here was an innocent child, a little girl torn apart in her own home, not as a means to an end, but as an end in and of itself.

This was entirely a farcical “investigation,” and he would have to fight a continuous uphill battle to lie and convince not only the people around whom he had lived all his life, who depended on him, but also himself that he could find a solution to all this. There was only a handful of other officers among whom he held seniority, even though he was only technically a sergeant. Just one guy with a criminal justice bachelor's and the bare bones training provided by the police academy, whose years of experience consisted entirely of breaking up barfights and handing out speeding tickets, wandering around with a gun and badge. There had been a full department with a chief and a detective once, but that was long gone. There was no more “lab” which he could send evidence to for analysis, no more federal or even state authorities to assist with more investigators, and seemingly unlimited resources. He was almost entirely on his own, at least for right now, facing a crime the likes of which he had never seen in his life, much less career.

He nearly doubled over, but stopped himself at the last minute, bracing his arms on his knees, and everything seemed to swim in front of his eyes, vomit rising in the back of his throat. This was real, this was now, this was happening. Mrs. Morrison kept crying. The snow outside kept falling.

He reached into the pocket of his heavy winter coat, extracting a plastic bag with sterile rubber gloves. This was a job that needed doing. He had no other choice.

He found himself some time later, driving back in his patrol car, the Ford Explorer had seen better days, rattling over every single pothole like the bones of a groaning old man. There was little reason to maintain the roads since the only people who could afford gas were either local authorities or military, and then, there weren’t the resources even if they really wanted to. In the trunk, the body of Elisa Morrison, wrapped in a black plastic body bag, seemed to weigh like a metric ton, although it's doubtful that the rusted suspension actually felt any of that weight. 

He passed through the small town, which was his whole world, or whatever was left of it. It was situated in a valley with a small stream running through the center, and beside it stood a large stone building that in bygone years was once a watermill, dating back to the town’s very inception. All around it clustered a few little shops which formed the heart of Main Street, several of their once intricately illuminated facades either abandoned or partially boarded up. Just beyond them, however, stood the remains of the Industrial Revolution, hulking shells of bright orange brick buildings, making up warehouses, a factory, and even a small rail yard. The accompanying railway rolled into town from the north and passed away once again towards the south, invariably bending towards the horizon like a parallel line to the mountains, the rust turning it an identical shade of orange to the bricks of the rail yard. The rest of the buildings are nearly all little houses, of various years of construction, and in equally various states of disrepair. The only thing unified about them was how they seemed to huddle together, as if they were trying to protect each other from the winter cold.

He made a turn off Main Street and into the parking lot of a squat one-story building with small, bunker-like windows, the police station. One of the other officers, a young, lanky, pale kid by the name of Kody Gutherson, stepped out to meet him and helped carry Elisa Morrison indoors and downstairs into the tiny room that served as the morgue. Previously, before it all went to shit, the only “visitors” were drunk drivers and their victims, and on one rare occasion, one man who was stabbed in a bar fight. Now, however, the corpse of a brutally murdered teenage girl lay there, as if silently blaming Burt for failing to protect her, protect the community, and that this was all his fault.

“Radio over to John that I need his advice. Tell him I need him to be here as fast as he can make it,” he ordered Kody, who nodded and scrambled back upstairs to the radio. Soon enough, within twenty minutes, a loud knock was heard at the front door, and a short, aged man, with thinning gray hair and a pair of round glasses, bundled up in a puffy parka, stepped into the station. This was John, the local pharmacist, the closest person to a doctor in the town.

“What’s the matter, Mr. Harrison? Has there been a death?” John asked, catching his breath. 

“Yes.” Burt hoarsely replied, “I’d like you to take a look at her, see what stands out, but please… Don’t mention it to anyone. It wouldn’t be good for morale if word got out before I have anything to show for it.”

He led John down to the basement, where the pharmacist began to unzip the body bag. Burt couldn’t bear to look, but he still heard John audibly gasp in surprise, revulsion, and fear when the old man must have seen the bloody pulp of Elisa’s upper body. He sat there in the room for some time, staring down at the concrete floor below while John conducted a rough approximation of an autopsy.

“Judging by the rigor mortis, she died last night, maybe sometime around 2 or 3 AM. There are bruises on her arm, so that may likely be signs of a struggle in which she was simply overpowered, but there is no evidence of rape or sexual violence. However, I doubt that the perpetrator was a human, but rather an animal of sorts, as far as I’m able to tell, she was bitten and eaten to death with no other visible injuries that may suggest murder, perhaps a bear?” John delivered his analysis, jotting down all of his observations on a sheet of paper and handing it to Burt. “It would also be in line with… the injuries… that a bear would have gone for the face and neck and bust rather than the limbs.”

“Thanks, John, I really appreciate it,” Burt replied, still looking down at the floor. “I’ll look into that possibility.”  In a very twisted sense of hope, he wished that it was something as simple as a bear attack, and not the alternative. But he had his reasons to doubt that.

“No problem…” The little old man looked just as shaken as Burt. “I’ll have to be heading back now, but let me know if there are any new developments.”

“Will do, sir.” Burt nodded and escorted John back out.

As John left, Burt reached into the bag that he had brought with him and took out the small window screen that had been forcefully pushed in by the killer to allow entrance into the trailer. He had meticulously disassembled it so as not to damage it further. Laying it down on a small table in the corner of the room, he measured it with a tape measure… exactly 16 inches wide. Although he was no expert on bears, it was nearly impossible to conceive of any bear larger than a cub successfully making their way through such an opening and then back out again.

Carefully examining the screen with gloved hands, he reached down to his duty belt and pulled out his flashlight, which had a blacklight function built into it. Turning it on, he swept the beam across the edge of the bent white metal frame. Clear as day, there was a set of fingerprints there; he didn’t even really need the black light other than to bring out the detail in them, as they were outlined in small specks of Elisa’s blood.

This was human. 

He rose up the stairs and stepped outside, taking a momentary breath of fresh air to clear his mind. The snow had ceased falling for now, but the darkness had begun falling to replace it. Evening rolled in fast on these short winter days. The few meager lights of the town lit up one by one in the windows, each one like a tiny lighthouse amid a storm of darkness, whose waves topped with black pines instead of white froth came crashing down over and around them always, tirelessly seeking to snuff out the light. To wash away the last few remaining vestiges of human presence and plunge the world back into the primordial soup of insanity and natural chaos. And yet, the little bulbs, candles, and lamps still fearlessly clung on even as their numbers dwindled, day after day, month after month, and year after year.

It was too late to make any serious headway in the investigation today, but he had made a list for tomorrow to interview several of the people closest to Elisa. Although, of course, there were no jilted lovers, gambling “buddies”, or unhappy creditors in the life of this teenage girl, there may still be some juvenile squabble, bullying, or jealousy that may have motivated a peer into committing such an act. It seemed improbable to Burt, as he could not even begin to imagine a teen doing that to poor Elisa, he still had to try. It was better than nothing. Better than conceive, or rather lend any further credence to the theory that had been naggling at the back of his consciousness immediately after arriving at the scene. No, not here.

By now, another officer, a shorter but certainly solidly built man by the name of Bill, a good friend of many years, had come back dragging with him a handcuffed man whose face and build were obscured by his saggy jeans and bulky hoodie.

“What’s the charge?” Burt asked Bill as he rushed to help him escort the man into the small annex to the police station,  which was the jail.

“Attempted burglary, trespassing,” Bill grunted as they shoved the man into a jail cell and swung the door closed behind him. Here, coldly lit by fluorescent lights, Burt could make out the face of the man much better; it was gaunt and overgrown with a scraggly, bushy beard. His eyes were hollow, and pupils dilated; wherever he was, it was clearly not here, which would largely explain his seeming lack of resistance to both of them dragging him in here. “Caught his ass trying to break into old Mary-Beth’s pantry while she was at today’s service. Took me a while to run him down, and when I eventually did, he was ranting out of his mind about how the demons made him do it. At least he mellowed out now.” Bill finished, catching his breath.

“Fuck…” Burt exclaimed with a sigh. A brief wave of hope crashed over him, maybe this was it, the same methed out creep who also might’ve also killed Elisa? Maybe it was all over before it even began? But he didn’t really dare to hope. “They keep coming hard and fast, huh?”

“It's just how the times are.” Bill shrugged in response.

“I suppose they are,” Burt mumbled. “You got everything ready to book him? I’ll step out and get some sleep, be back in about nine hours. Keep an eye on him and don’t burn this place down in the meantime.” He told Bill, only half jokingly.

“I will.” Bill smiled, still unaware of the exact details of Elisa Morrison’s case.

 Burt stepped on over to the car, turned the key, and rolled off into the night, the yellow headlights sweeping over the snow-covered roads. He parked it in the parking lot of a building that to any stranger’s eye would have presented itself as a gloomy, half-abandoned warehouse, made of a similar set of large bricks, two stories high and complete with small recessed windows. The only thing that set it apart as an apartment building was the shoddy-looking wood, motel-like balcony that extended to the second floor. Rising up the staircase, he fished in his pockets for the keys and, after fumbling for a second, opened the door and found himself home. Maybe “home” was a little too strong a word, but this was relatively safe, simple, comfortable, and above all, warmed his soul just a little bit. The wood-paneled walls, evidently installed in either the 70s or 80s, had soaked up years of cheap cigarette smoke and steam from the Salisbury steaks of TV dinners, mixed it all together with the smell of aging pine and slowly radiating back out a distinct woody yet now familiar smell.

He added to it with tonight’s dinner consisting of two cans, one a cheap local brewed “beer”, the contents and alcohol content of which he wasn’t exactly sure of, but it did its job, and a can of Campbell’s of a suitable vintage for the main course. Afterwards, he grabbed a quick shower, changed into a new set of clothing, popped in a CD, and lay there on the bed listening to the soft sounds of the music. Before his eyes rushed a stream of memories, fears, and insecurities melding in with dreams as his eyelids closed. He opened his eyes to the ringing of his alarm, feeling as though he had just blinked. Time for work again.

He drove over to the high school, a relatively newly-built building, finished right before everything went to shit, complete with the school district’s pride and joy, a football field. All put together, it was a reassuring sight for Burt because deep inside, he wanted to believe that even up until the end, the plan for the future was bright and hopeful, that so many resources could be poured into such a grand investment for future generations. Although, hell, that didn’t matter now, did it? In fact, it made everything even more tragic in retrospect. By now, however, it had been adapted into the elementary, middle, and high school all in one, sort of like the reincarnation of those one-room schoolhouses from the days of the pioneers.

The principal was a woman by the name Elizabeth Polk, on whom the years clearly weighed quite heavily, and yet, despite this, she held herself together marvelously, her greying blonde hair swept back in an impressively tight ponytail. She stood there, in the office, her hands crossed over her chest, her posture so taught it was almost unnatural. Everything in her body visibly tensed as Burt recounted in general details the nature of the investigation thus far. He had guessed she might have heard of it already through the rumors that had undoubtedly spread around, but he wanted to reaffirm that she had all the correct information. Still, she remained stoic throughout it all, even though it affected her greatly, seeming to grow many years older with every word he spoke.

She didn’t seem to have any relevant information on Elisa Morrison. She called in her teacher, Mrs. Brittney Hull, however, and as soon as she walked in, Burt could see that the woman had already heard the news. Her eyes were red and huge, grey, and bags hung beneath them.

“I’m SergeantBurt Harrison, local police. I'm here to ask you a few questions about one of your students, Elisa Morrison. Unfortunately, she was found-” Burt began, but Mrs. Hull abruptly cut him off with a vigorous shaking of her head, letting out a barely audible whimper, making a great effort not to cry. “I’m sorry, ma’am, I’ll try to keep this short,” Burt spoke in acknowledgement. “But I need to know about any relationships or conflicts that Elisa may have had. How many friends did she have? What were her grades like?”

   “She… she was one of my best students…” Mrs. Hull began before having to pause to hold back a sob. “But she didn’t have very many friends, at least as far as I’m aware. She was best friends with another girl, Jill Brady. They were almost inseparable, but now with Elisa gone, Jill hasn’t shown up to school either.”

“So Jill isn’t in school either? When was the last time she was in attendance?” Burt asked, his attention piqued.

“Two days ago, the last day that Elisa was alive. Something seemed off, a disagreement of some sort between them, perhaps, I don’t know.” Mrs. Hull responded, thoughtfully trying to remember.

“But are you aware of any other incidents, maybe she was bullied by other classmates, teased, had rumors spread about her?” Burt asked, digging deeper.

“No, not that I’m aware of. She was always a loner, but she was never really picked on, got along quite well with everyone, but never really made friends with anyone else except Jill.” Mrs. Hull began, pausing and then quickly added on, “Oh, but there was one thing, just last week, there was actually a rumor going about that I happened to overhear, some of the other girls were gossiping that Elisa had a crush on Jill’s boyfriend, Hunter Dugan. Perhaps, that’s what they were arguing about just before…” she trailed off again, trying to contain herself. Burt could see that she blamed herself for not stepping in, for not getting involved, that somehow, something she could have done, if only she knew what, could have saved the girl.

“Thank you, that’s very helpful,” Burt said, nodding, and turned to the principal. “And, I suppose you have the addresses of Jill and Hunter on file, if I may have them?”

“Yes, we do,” she confirmed courtly, turned around, and after rifling through a cumbersome metal filing cabinet, dug out a paper, copied from it two names and addresses on a sticky note, and handed it to Burt. “I’m really sorry, but we only have one copy of the official records. You can always see it if you might need it again.”

“No issue, that’ll be sufficient. Thank you once again for your help, Mrs. Polk and Mrs. Hull. Try to have a nice day,” he said, getting up from the chair, taking the sticky note and giving the two women a small, polite bow, exited.

“Godspeed, sir!” he heard Mrs. Polk call out from behind him.

He drove off, heading over to Jill Brady’s house. He had already been well acquainted with her mother, Mrs. Ada Brady, who had a reputation for both her energy and eccentricity, especially true from the perspective of her neighbors. This conversation certainly wasn’t going to go well.

He drove his car through the snow, passing by several powder-covered street signs before he sighted the right one: Baker Avenue. It was an aged, one-story house backing out to the woods beyond, built in the 1950s, a leftover artifact from the era of universal post-WW2 optimism and prosperity. It had been kept up quite well, all things considered, with white plastic siding which blended in with the snow. Trudging over to the front door, he gave a loud knock against it, announcing himself. “Police!”

Mrs. Brady opened the door in just a minute. She was a small, frenzied-looking little woman, especially now as she was all wrapped up in a blanket over a fuzzy gown, with straight, jet black hair framing the tired, puffy features of her face. She already knew what he was going to ask her.

“You’re here about Elisa Morrison, aren't you?” she asked softly.

‘Yes, ma'am, ' he confirmed.

“Took you long enough. Come in,” she said, ushering him inside. The inside was an eclectic mess of various items, sensations, smells, and sights. She couldn’t quite be called a hoarder, yet it was all too messy. Mismatched rugs lined the scratched-up wood floor and hung from the walls, some with a Turkish or Asian design, the others with a distinctly Native American pattern. Books were lying about, some on shelves, the others stacked up against the corners like some sort of design statement. Among them numbered many different genres and authors, but quite a few of them featured titles on folklore, Wicca, and spiritualism from what he was able to catch at a glance. Scented candles and dirty mason jars filled with half-burned incense sticks stood in the center of a coffee table whose legs had been unmistakably thinned out by the teeth and claws of some of her little furry feline raptors. In a sense, a type of hippie-flavored organized chaos. “Please, have a seat,” she said, pointing at a well-worn couch.

“Thanks,” he nodded solemnly, carefully taking a seat just on the edge. “I’ve heard your daughter was very good friends with Elisa. May I ask how she’s taking the news?”

“Very poorly… As soon as she heard about what happened, she locked herself in her room. She’s barely come out other than to eat, drink, and use the bathroom. In fact, just last night she fell really, really ill, very high fever, nausea, and she’s been in bed ever since, with me taking care of her. “ Mrs. Brady explained, looking down at the floor with a deeply worried expression. “It’s…It’s not even the flu, I don’t think… Just something brought on by a total mental and physical collapse…Oh my poor girl.”

“Would it be possible for me to see her and talk to her?” Burt asked, looking at her with sympathy.

“No, I’m afraid not. She was just throwing up really badly this morning, and I just got her to take some medicine to take the fever down a few degrees, just enough for her to sleep.” Mrs. Brady shook her head. “She needs her rest.”

“I suppose so,” he reluctantly agreed. “But in that case, could you tell me if your daughter spoke to you about anything regarding Elisa before the murder?”

“Are you really implying that my angel had anything to do with it?” she spoke in a hushed tone, and her small frame quickly became full of animated fury. “How dare you! I thought you had come here with a real breakthrough in the case, so I could soothe my child’s broken heart, and instead, you come here and blame her? I knew you pigs were never good for anything!” she spilled her tirade at him, but still quiet enough not to risk waking her daughter.

“Maam, maam, I’m just trying to gather information…” he said as calmly as possible, trying to reassure her. I’m not blaming your daughter, but if perhaps Elisa was killed by a peer over some drama at school, your daughter may be the only person with any real insight into the matter, given how close she was with her.” He watched the anger slowly slip from Mrs. Brady’s face over the course of a tense few moments.

“Hmm, she didn’t speak much of Elisa to me recently,” she finally said, regaining her composure, “But she did go out to a party just the night before…it happened… It was Elisa, my daughter, and her boyfriend, Hunter.”

“And when exactly was this?” Burt asked, writing down the details of the testimony in his notepad.

“This was two days ago, exactly the night of the murder. Hunter came by at around eight, picked up my Jill, and they went to get Elisa as well. Jill came back before eleven, just how I told her to be, and then she was so tired she went straight to bed.” Mrs. Brady recounted, trying to recall all of the details.

“Thank you, then, that would be all,” he said, getting up from the couch.

“And one more thing…” she said, and he could see it in her face that she was conflicted as to whether or not to tell him. “I don’t think you’re going to find the person responsible. I’ve felt a bad presence around our town for the past week, the kind that wasn’t there before. Dark energy. This is not the work of living men but the work of a vengeful, angry spirit, the Wendigo, come to take revenge on our town. It is the fault of white men who brought this evil on us, who stole this land. You won’t find anyone! Only through belief and prayer to the natives to whom this land truly belongs can we be saved,” she ranted to him. In return, he stopped, thinking over her words.

“With all due respect, Mrs., no spirits came to help the natives in their time of need when Old Hickory sent them off, so why would any be here now? The actions of very real bad men are much more real and dangerous than any evil native ghosts. I promise, I’ll do everything in my power to come back here and deliver the news that we’ve caught the bastard responsible as soon as I can. Good day,” he said and walked back out into the snow.

His next step was that Hunter Dugan character. His address brought Burt to an interesting sight. It was a larger, two-story house, considerably newer and much more opulent than many of the others, and yet still somehow worse for wear. A relatively new, large, lifted, and unmistakably broken-down SUV stood parked in the driveway, with a faded “thin blue line” sticker still partly visible on the rear window. He knocked on the door and announced himself, and within a few minutes, a balding middle-aged man with a beard that was short yet patchy opened the door.

“Mr. Dugan, I presume? I’m Sergeant Burt Harrison, local police, and I’d like to ask your son a few questions…” Burt began.

“Oh, what has that…” Mr Dugan caught himself before swearing, “What has he gotten himself into now?”

“It’s about Elisa Morrison, the girl who was found murdered yesterday. Reportedly, your son was one of the last people to see her alive, so I’d like to ask him a few questions.” Burt stated calmly yet confidently, “May I come in?”

“Not without a warrant, you can’t!” Mr. Dugan rejected outright, “Stand here and I’ll bring his sorry ass out here.” And surely, within five minutes, there on the porch stood a tall yet scrawny young man, brown hair swept upwards in a fringe that could double as the brim of a baseball cap. He looked like the type that girls his age would swoon over, complete with a very sharp jawline. However, despite his handsome appearance, there was something about him, perhaps it was just because he got called out into the cold to be interrogated by a police officer, but there was something in his eyes, some hard-to-describe squirrely quality to them.

“Hunter Dugan?” Burt asked, trying to confirm the young man’s identity.

“Yes, sir,” Hunter replied nervously, trying to sound polite.

“When was the last time you saw Elisa Morrison?” Burt asked, carefully studying him.

“Just two days ago, we… I mean, Julia, Elisa, and I were going to a party on 4th Street. Afterwards, we parted ways and Elisa went back home by herself.” Hunter began to recount. In this case, “party” almost certainly meant sitting around somebody’s fire pit smoking or doing some sort of drugs, but now was not the time to press the issue, at least not yet. Still, Burt couldn’t help but think to himself that, of all the things to suffer supply shortages, drugs weren’t one of them.

“Was it your idea to attend the party?” he asked the boy, gauging his reaction.

“I dunno…” Hunter shrugged, “We all thought it be kind of fun, I guess.”

“And Elisa, did she walk back by herself?” he questioned him, “And you didn’t think to be a gentleman and at least walk her back to her home? It's not far from here after all.”

“Well… I also had to take Julia back to her place after all, and that was in the opposite direction…” Hunter stammered, “Well, I just didn’t think of it, I’m sorry.”

“Well, it ain’t me you have to apologize to, I’m afraid,” Burt responded dryly. “And at what time did you get back?”

“About midnight,” he admitted.

“And during the party, did you notice any arguments, disagreements perhaps with Elisa? Was she acting unusually?” Burt asked, although he guessed that someone like Hunter was almost certainly helpless at being able to understand body language or other forms of non-verbal communication unless they were blatantly obvious.

“No, not that I can remember,” the young man said and shook his head, and yet Burt noticed, albeit briefly, Hunter’s eyes darted to the side, avoiding eye contact with him as if he was even just visually trying to dive into the snow and eject himself from this conversation.

“Very well, thank you for your time and cooperation.” Burt nodded and headed off again. He sat in his car for some time, watching as Hunter headed back indoors, and through the windows, he could barely make out the shapes of him and his parents arguing. He compared his notes, Hunter’s testimony to Mrs. Brady’s. Jill had supposedly gotten home at just around eleven, while it took Hunter another hour to make what should have been a ten-minute walk. A suspicion began to brew in his mind, but still, it was yet unfounded. Turning over the ignition, he drove back off to the Morrisons’.

Mrs. Morrison’s home looked just the same as it had when he was there a day ago. A small camping lamp now illuminated the trailer, shedding light on the mess that had been lying around since yesterday. Dirty clothing, blankets, and more heaps of stuff, which Burt couldn’t quite identify, lay thrown about on the floor. Mrs. Morrison had not been able to find the strength in herself to clean up, and he couldn’t blame her. She looked at him from the semi-darkness, eyes wet and red.

“Any news?” she spoke in an almost whisper.

“No, unfortunately, not yet, but I’m putting together a timeline of events,” Burt explained. “Can you remember what time Elisa got back from the party that night?”

“Quarter to midnight or so.” Mrs. Morrison spoke, recalling the time, “I was so mad at her then, but she was so happy, just beaming, oh god, why did I have to be mad at her? Why couldn’t I just have hugged her and told her that I loved her over and over again? I’m so sorry, my baby, I’m so sorry…” she burst into tears once again. Burt sat there, silently. What could he even say? Should he try to reassure her, to tell her that he’s going to catch the person responsible, even if he didn’t even believe that himself? And even if he did, what good would it do to her? Would she even care? Nothing now would bring Elisa back.

“My condolences, once more,” he rasped and then fell silent for some time before speaking again. “We’ll take care of the funeral. Would you like any arrangements done in regard to the church, plot, or date of the burial?” There wasn’t much else he could do with the body. He didn’t have the equipment or expertise to conduct a further, more in-depth autopsy, and the room where her body was kept was cooled but not actually refrigerated, and decay was going to get rid of all of the remaining evidence anyway.

“Tomorrow, at the Lutheran Church on Willow Street. I have a plot there, but I never thought it would be for her…” Tears streamed down her face again. “I want her to be next to her dad.”

She buried her head into his shoulder and cried for a while, until it simply turned into long, deep, sorrowful sobs like a person drowning. And drowning she was, drowning perhaps in despair and hopelessness, drowning because there could be no more surfacing for a breath of fresh air from this. Burt sat there, with an arm around her half-heartedly, staring off into space, watching little bits of dust float by, hearing a fly buzz as it slammed itself head first into one of the windows over and over again, its destination so close yet impossibly far. He smelled the decaying linoleum, the rotting plywood, the rusting sheet metal of the walls. He knew he had to say something, do something, to stop the inevitable, and it tore his heart into shreds knowing that he couldn’t. Elisa would be buried, but this, this corroding bucket would become her mother’s tomb. There was nothing else left for her here.

After Mrs. Morrison had cried herself to sleep on his shoulder, he got up carefully and draped a blanket over her, letting her lie on the couch before getting up and walking out, closing the door behind him. He had Elisa’s body wrapped up and moved over to the church, where they would place her in what casket they could. After that was out of Burt’s control, he concentrated his attention back to the facts of the case. He had investigated what leads he could, and the only thing they’d definitively revealed to him was the inconsistency of the claimed times that each of the teens reportedly had gotten back from the party.

To him, Hunter seemed the most suspicious, but even then, for what? Some disjointed facts and nervous glances? Surely that wasn’t enough to issue a warrant over, and even if he got one, what would he find? A baggie of weed and a bong under his bed, right next to his crusty sock?

Burt padded himself down as he exited the building that passed for a police station. The badge was still there, the sharp pin biting at his chest. He remembered times in his life when that badge seemed to weigh so, so heavy, but none as bad as now. He remembered protests, people carrying signs demanding justice over every real or perceived breach of justice or excessive force employed by a police officer, and how common they seemed to get in those later years, how their words at times enflamed both shame and anger in his heart, so that in the early mornings when he would have to crawl out of bed and go to work, he could barely find the motivation to do so. Life seemed terrible then, but he would trade places with his past self in a heartbeat.

Next, his hand fell to the comforting grip of the gun on his hip, a .38 revolver, old school. A Glock had been his constant companion for many years, but obviously it had become very difficult to source parts for it, so that when the slide had cracked one fateful day, he had no choice but to replace it. He was just thankful it happened while on the range and not when he really needed it, although he had never had to fire a gun in the line of duty as a cop before.

He looked back up at the mountains, towering overhead as he made his way with some difficulty through the snow towards his patrol car. The chill wind whistled between the mountains, carrying off whatever tidings it bore southward, down the very mountain ridge which stretched from the Maine Republic to what was once Georgia. Maybe things were going better down there; he doubted it, but he could only hope. 

These same mountains had seen it all. They had seen continents rise out from under the briny deep and seen them crack asunder. They had withstood the millennia-long sieges of glaciers and stood victorious. They still remembered the ancient tales and stories of the Native Americans that had passed from truths exposed by chiefs and shamans to the whispers that dying, decrepit elders took with them into the afterlife, with none around left to pass them on. The mountains had watched the star-spangled banner rise and reign across the continent, and just the same, they had laughed as the eagle, inevitably, lost its wings. He himself was born here, raised here, and would eventually die here. His body and his mind would once more then return to the native rock from which it was hewn and would rejoin the unending, mycelial memory of those snowy, unfeeling peaks.

As he reached the patrol car, something howled in the distance, and the sound was carried, amplified, and echoed by the slopes, almost as if it were a cold, dry laugh. It was time to go to work.

He drove down the winding, yet familiar, serpentine roads, finally reaching his destination: a dilapidated trailer home, nestled amid a grove of dead trees, neighbored by other similar dwellings. 

“This trailer park was once full of people, surviving day by day, working dead-end jobs they hated for meager pay. I wonder how many of them are left…” he grimly thought to himself. “How many of those small little dwellings, with broken blinds, peeling paint and the whole structure slightly tilting to one side were the result of a person still holding on even though the hope for a better life had long since vanished for them, or were the only inhabitants of these trailers the corpses of people who simply never woke one day, or worse, and lacked anyone else in this world to even notice...”

However, the trailer he was here for had already gathered a small crowd of curious onlookers, mainly men, clutching what guns or weapons they had while their wives and children peered at the scene from yellowed and dirty windows.

“Let’s disperse folks, let’s disperse… This is a police matter now. I’ll handle this quicker if you go back to your homes and don’t tamper with any of the evidence,” he loudly proclaimed, trying his best to inspire confidence. “There is nothing to worry about!” he added that last part even though he himself didn’t believe it.

He stepped over a frayed “Welcome” mat badly battered by the elements, and pushed open the squeaky screen door. Even though it was just a screen door, he marvelled at just how well it worked at muffling out the wailing of the mother who had called him, Mrs. Morrison. Through the gossamer veil of dust particles floating in the air, he could see her as a vague shadow curled up in the fetal position on the couch along the wall. To the right of him, he could see another shadow, lying silently and unmovingly on one of the beds in a pool of blood.

“Police, ma’am,” he announced his arrival in a hoarse voice, but she didn’t pay him attention. After all, there was nothing he could do that could ease her pain. Even if he somehow immediately tracked down whoever was responsible, it still wouldn’t bring her girl back.

He walked forward into the bedroom, the floor creaking slightly under every careful step. The teenage girl lay there, partially undressed, the clothes peeled away from her upper body; however, Burt guessed that the crime that had taken place here was certainly not of a sexual nature, at the very least not exclusively. Too much of her was missing.

A faint fresh breeze brushed against his face, upheaving once more the stench of death in the room, which had just begun to settle like mud swirling in a puddle. He turned and noticed that the window in the room had been left open, no, not just open, but broken. The actual glass remained intact, and so did the lock holding the window to the frame, but the entire frame had been partially torn out of the paper-thin wall of the motor home, leaving a slightly jagged edge where the sheet metal simply gave way.

It then hit him all at once, and so much of him wanted to go and join Mrs. Morrison in her inconsolable wailing. What was he doing here? What was the point of all of this? He had seen death before, now especially since the collapse. But nothing could yet compare to this. Here was an innocent child, a little girl torn apart in her own home, not as a means to an end, but as an end in and of itself.

This was entirely a farcical “investigation,” and he would have to fight a continuous uphill battle to lie and convince not only the people around whom he had lived all his life, who depended on him, but also himself that he could find a solution to all this. There was only a handful of other officers among whom he held seniority, even though he was only technically a sergeant. Just one guy with a criminal justice bachelor's and the bare bones training provided by the police academy, whose years of experience consisted entirely of breaking up barfights and handing out speeding tickets, wandering around with a gun and badge. There had been a full department with a chief and a detective once, but that was long gone. There was no more “lab” which he could send evidence to for analysis, no more federal or even state authorities to assist with more investigators, and seemingly unlimited resources. He was almost entirely on his own, at least for right now, facing a crime the likes of which he had never seen in his life, much less career.

He nearly doubled over, but stopped himself at the last minute, bracing his arms on his knees, and everything seemed to swim in front of his eyes, vomit rising in the back of his throat. This was real, this was now, this was happening. Mrs. Morrison kept crying. The snow outside kept falling.

He reached into the pocket of his heavy winter coat, extracting a plastic bag with sterile rubber gloves. This was a job that needed doing. He had no other choice.

He found himself some time later, driving back in his patrol car, the Ford Explorer had seen better days, rattling over every single pothole like the bones of a groaning old man. There was little reason to maintain the roads since the only people who could afford gas were either local authorities or military, and then, there weren’t the resources even if they really wanted to. In the trunk, the body of Elisa Morrison, wrapped in a black plastic body bag, seemed to weigh like a metric ton, although it's doubtful that the rusted suspension actually felt any of that weight. 

He passed through the small town, which was his whole world, or whatever was left of it. It was situated in a valley with a small stream running through the center, and beside it stood a large stone building that in bygone years was once a watermill, dating back to the town’s very inception. All around it clustered a few little shops which formed the heart of Main Street, several of their once intricately illuminated facades either abandoned or partially boarded up. Just beyond them, however, stood the remains of the Industrial Revolution, hulking shells of bright orange brick buildings, making up warehouses, a factory, and even a small rail yard. The accompanying railway rolled into town from the north and passed away once again towards the south, invariably bending towards the horizon like a parallel line to the mountains, the rust turning it an identical shade of orange to the bricks of the rail yard. The rest of the buildings are nearly all little houses, of various years of construction, and in equally various states of disrepair. The only thing unified about them was how they seemed to huddle together, as if they were trying to protect each other from the winter cold.

He made a turn off Main Street and into the parking lot of a squat one-story building with small, bunker-like windows, the police station. One of the other officers, a young, lanky, pale kid by the name of Kody Gutherson, stepped out to meet him and helped carry Elisa Morrison indoors and downstairs into the tiny room that served as the morgue. Previously, before it all went to shit, the only “visitors” were drunk drivers and their victims, and on one rare occasion, one man who was stabbed in a bar fight. Now, however, the corpse of a brutally murdered teenage girl lay there, as if silently blaming Burt for failing to protect her, protect the community, and that this was all his fault.

“Radio over to John that I need his advice. Tell him I need him to be here as fast as he can make it,” he ordered Kody, who nodded and scrambled back upstairs to the radio. Soon enough, within twenty minutes, a loud knock was heard at the front door, and a short, aged man, with thinning gray hair and a pair of round glasses, bundled up in a puffy parka, stepped into the station. This was John, the local pharmacist, the closest person to a doctor in the town.

“What’s the matter, Mr. Harrison? Has there been a death?” John asked, catching his breath. 

“Yes.” Burt hoarsely replied, “I’d like you to take a look at her, see what stands out, but please… Don’t mention it to anyone. It wouldn’t be good for morale if word got out before I have anything to show for it.”

He led John down to the basement, where the pharmacist began to unzip the body bag. Burt couldn’t bear to look, but he still heard John audibly gasp in surprise, revulsion, and fear when the old man must have seen the bloody pulp of Elisa’s upper body. He sat there in the room for some time, staring down at the concrete floor below while John conducted a rough approximation of an autopsy.

“Judging by the rigor mortis, she died last night, maybe sometime around 2 or 3 AM. There are bruises on her arm, so that may likely be signs of a struggle in which she was simply overpowered, but there is no evidence of rape or sexual violence. However, I doubt that the perpetrator was a human, but rather an animal of sorts, as far as I’m able to tell, she was bitten and eaten to death with no other visible injuries that may suggest murder, perhaps a bear?” John delivered his analysis, jotting down all of his observations on a sheet of paper and handing it to Burt. “It would also be in line with… the injuries… that a bear would have gone for the face and neck and bust rather than the limbs.”

“Thanks, John, I really appreciate it,” Burt replied, still looking down at the floor. “I’ll look into that possibility.”  In a very twisted sense of hope, he wished that it was something as simple as a bear attack, and not the alternative. But he had his reasons to doubt that.

“No problem…” The little old man looked just as shaken as Burt. “I’ll have to be heading back now, but let me know if there are any new developments.”

“Will do, sir.” Burt nodded and escorted John back out.

As John left, Burt reached into the bag that he had brought with him and took out the small window screen that had been forcefully pushed in by the killer to allow entrance into the trailer. He had meticulously disassembled it so as not to damage it further. Laying it down on a small table in the corner of the room, he measured it with a tape measure… exactly 16 inches wide. Although he was no expert on bears, it was nearly impossible to conceive of any bear larger than a cub successfully making their way through such an opening and then back out again.

Carefully examining the screen with gloved hands, he reached down to his duty belt and pulled out his flashlight, which had a blacklight function built into it. Turning it on, he swept the beam across the edge of the bent white metal frame. Clear as day, there was a set of fingerprints there; he didn’t even really need the black light other than to bring out the detail in them, as they were outlined in small specks of Elisa’s blood.

This was human. 

He rose up the stairs and stepped outside, taking a momentary breath of fresh air to clear his mind. The snow had ceased falling for now, but the darkness had begun falling to replace it. Evening rolled in fast on these short winter days. The few meager lights of the town lit up one by one in the windows, each one like a tiny lighthouse amid a storm of darkness, whose waves topped with black pines instead of white froth came crashing down over and around them always, tirelessly seeking to snuff out the light. To wash away the last few remaining vestiges of human presence and plunge the world back into the primordial soup of insanity and natural chaos. And yet, the little bulbs, candles, and lamps still fearlessly clung on even as their numbers dwindled, day after day, month after month, and year after year.

It was too late to make any serious headway in the investigation today, but he had made a list for tomorrow to interview several of the people closest to Elisa. Although, of course, there were no jilted lovers, gambling “buddies”, or unhappy creditors in the life of this teenage girl, there may still be some juvenile squabble, bullying, or jealousy that may have motivated a peer into committing such an act. It seemed improbable to Burt, as he could not even begin to imagine a teen doing that to poor Elisa, he still had to try. It was better than nothing. Better than conceive, or rather lend any further credence to the theory that had been naggling at the back of his consciousness immediately after arriving at the scene. No, not here.

By now, another officer, a shorter but certainly solidly built man by the name of Bill, a good friend of many years, had come back dragging with him a handcuffed man whose face and build were obscured by his saggy jeans and bulky hoodie.

“What’s the charge?” Burt asked Bill as he rushed to help him escort the man into the small annex to the police station,  which was the jail.

“Attempted burglary, trespassing,” Bill grunted as they shoved the man into a jail cell and swung the door closed behind him. Here, coldly lit by fluorescent lights, Burt could make out the face of the man much better; it was gaunt and overgrown with a scraggly, bushy beard. His eyes were hollow, and pupils dilated; wherever he was, it was clearly not here, which would largely explain his seeming lack of resistance to both of them dragging him in here. “Caught his ass trying to break into old Mary-Beth’s pantry while she was at today’s service. Took me a while to run him down, and when I eventually did, he was ranting out of his mind about how the demons made him do it. At least he mellowed out now.” Bill finished, catching his breath.

“Fuck…” Burt exclaimed with a sigh. A brief wave of hope crashed over him, maybe this was it, the same methed out creep who also might’ve also killed Elisa? Maybe it was all over before it even began? But he didn’t really dare to hope. “They keep coming hard and fast, huh?”

“It's just how the times are.” Bill shrugged in response.

“I suppose they are,” Burt mumbled. “You got everything ready to book him? I’ll step out and get some sleep, be back in about nine hours. Keep an eye on him and don’t burn this place down in the meantime.” He told Bill, only half jokingly.

“I will.” Bill smiled, still unaware of the exact details of Elisa Morrison’s case.

 Burt stepped on over to the car, turned the key, and rolled off into the night, the yellow headlights sweeping over the snow-covered roads. He parked it in the parking lot of a building that to any stranger’s eye would have presented itself as a gloomy, half-abandoned warehouse, made of a similar set of large bricks, two stories high and complete with small recessed windows. The only thing that set it apart as an apartment building was the shoddy-looking wood, motel-like balcony that extended to the second floor. Rising up the staircase, he fished in his pockets for the keys and, after fumbling for a second, opened the door and found himself home. Maybe “home” was a little too strong a word, but this was relatively safe, simple, comfortable, and above all, warmed his soul just a little bit. The wood-paneled walls, evidently installed in either the 70s or 80s, had soaked up years of cheap cigarette smoke and steam from the Salisbury steaks of TV dinners, mixed it all together with the smell of aging pine and slowly radiating back out a distinct woody yet now familiar smell.

He added to it with tonight’s dinner consisting of two cans, one a cheap local brewed “beer”, the contents and alcohol content of which he wasn’t exactly sure of, but it did its job, and a can of Campbell’s of a suitable vintage for the main course. Afterwards, he grabbed a quick shower, changed into a new set of clothing, popped in a CD, and lay there on the bed listening to the soft sounds of the music. Before his eyes rushed a stream of memories, fears, and insecurities melding in with dreams as his eyelids closed. He opened his eyes to the ringing of his alarm, feeling as though he had just blinked. Time for work again.

He drove over to the high school, a relatively newly-built building, finished right before everything went to shit, complete with the school district’s pride and joy, a football field. All put together, it was a reassuring sight for Burt because deep inside, he wanted to believe that even up until the end, the plan for the future was bright and hopeful, that so many resources could be poured into such a grand investment for future generations. Although, hell, that didn’t matter now, did it? In fact, it made everything even more tragic in retrospect. By now, however, it had been adapted into the elementary, middle, and high school all in one, sort of like the reincarnation of those one-room schoolhouses from the days of the pioneers.

The principal was a woman by the name Elizabeth Polk, on whom the years clearly weighed quite heavily, and yet, despite this, she held herself together marvelously, her greying blonde hair swept back in an impressively tight ponytail. She stood there, in the office, her hands crossed over her chest, her posture so taught it was almost unnatural. Everything in her body visibly tensed as Burt recounted in general details the nature of the investigation thus far. He had guessed she might have heard of it already through the rumors that had undoubtedly spread around, but he wanted to reaffirm that she had all the correct information. Still, she remained stoic throughout it all, even though it affected her greatly, seeming to grow many years older with every word he spoke.

She didn’t seem to have any relevant information on Elisa Morrison. She called in her teacher, Mrs. Brittney Hull, however, and as soon as she walked in, Burt could see that the woman had already heard the news. Her eyes were red and huge, grey, and bags hung beneath them.

“I’m SergeantBurt Harrison, local police. I'm here to ask you a few questions about one of your students, Elisa Morrison. Unfortunately, she was found-” Burt began, but Mrs. Hull abruptly cut him off with a vigorous shaking of her head, letting out a barely audible whimper, making a great effort not to cry. “I’m sorry, ma’am, I’ll try to keep this short,” Burt spoke in acknowledgement. “But I need to know about any relationships or conflicts that Elisa may have had. How many friends did she have? What were her grades like?”

   “She… she was one of my best students…” Mrs. Hull began before having to pause to hold back a sob. “But she didn’t have very many friends, at least as far as I’m aware. She was best friends with another girl, Jill Brady. They were almost inseparable, but now with Elisa gone, Jill hasn’t shown up to school either.”

“So Jill isn’t in school either? When was the last time she was in attendance?” Burt asked, his attention piqued.

“Two days ago, the last day that Elisa was alive. Something seemed off, a disagreement of some sort between them, perhaps, I don’t know.” Mrs. Hull responded, thoughtfully trying to remember.

“But are you aware of any other incidents, maybe she was bullied by other classmates, teased, had rumors spread about her?” Burt asked, digging deeper.

“No, not that I’m aware of. She was always a loner, but she was never really picked on, got along quite well with everyone, but never really made friends with anyone else except Jill.” Mrs. Hull began, pausing and then quickly added on, “Oh, but there was one thing, just last week, there was actually a rumor going about that I happened to overhear, some of the other girls were gossiping that Elisa had a crush on Jill’s boyfriend, Hunter Dugan. Perhaps, that’s what they were arguing about just before…” she trailed off again, trying to contain herself. Burt could see that she blamed herself for not stepping in, for not getting involved, that somehow, something she could have done, if only she knew what, could have saved the girl.

“Thank you, that’s very helpful,” Burt said, nodding, and turned to the principal. “And, I suppose you have the addresses of Jill and Hunter on file, if I may have them?”

“Yes, we do,” she confirmed courtly, turned around, and after rifling through a cumbersome metal filing cabinet, dug out a paper, copied from it two names and addresses on a sticky note, and handed it to Burt. “I’m really sorry, but we only have one copy of the official records. You can always see it if you might need it again.”

“No issue, that’ll be sufficient. Thank you once again for your help, Mrs. Polk and Mrs. Hull. Try to have a nice day,” he said, getting up from the chair, taking the sticky note and giving the two women a small, polite bow, exited.

“Godspeed, sir!” he heard Mrs. Polk call out from behind him.

He drove off, heading over to Jill Brady’s house. He had already been well acquainted with her mother, Mrs. Ada Brady, who had a reputation for both her energy and eccentricity, especially true from the perspective of her neighbors. This conversation certainly wasn’t going to go well.

He drove his car through the snow, passing by several powder-covered street signs before he sighted the right one: Baker Avenue. It was an aged, one-story house backing out to the woods beyond, built in the 1950s, a leftover artifact from the era of universal post-WW2 optimism and prosperity. It had been kept up quite well, all things considered, with white plastic siding which blended in with the snow. Trudging over to the front door, he gave a loud knock against it, announcing himself. “Police!”

Mrs. Brady opened the door in just a minute. She was a small, frenzied-looking little woman, especially now as she was all wrapped up in a blanket over a fuzzy gown, with straight, jet black hair framing the tired, puffy features of her face. She already knew what he was going to ask her.

“You’re here about Elisa Morrison, aren't you?” she asked softly.

‘Yes, ma'am, ' he confirmed.

“Took you long enough. Come in,” she said, ushering him inside. The inside was an eclectic mess of various items, sensations, smells, and sights. She couldn’t quite be called a hoarder, yet it was all too messy. Mismatched rugs lined the scratched-up wood floor and hung from the walls, some with a Turkish or Asian design, the others with a distinctly Native American pattern. Books were lying about, some on shelves, the others stacked up against the corners like some sort of design statement. Among them numbered many different genres and authors, but quite a few of them featured titles on folklore, Wicca, and spiritualism from what he was able to catch at a glance. Scented candles and dirty mason jars filled with half-burned incense sticks stood in the center of a coffee table whose legs had been unmistakably thinned out by the teeth and claws of some of her little furry feline raptors. In a sense, a type of hippie-flavored organized chaos. “Please, have a seat,” she said, pointing at a well-worn couch.

“Thanks,” he nodded solemnly, carefully taking a seat just on the edge. “I’ve heard your daughter was very good friends with Elisa. May I ask how she’s taking the news?”

“Very poorly… As soon as she heard about what happened, she locked herself in her room. She’s barely come out other than to eat, drink, and use the bathroom. In fact, just last night she fell really, really ill, very high fever, nausea, and she’s been in bed ever since, with me taking care of her. “ Mrs. Brady explained, looking down at the floor with a deeply worried expression. “It’s…It’s not even the flu, I don’t think… Just something brought on by a total mental and physical collapse…Oh my poor girl.”

“Would it be possible for me to see her and talk to her?” Burt asked, looking at her with sympathy.

“No, I’m afraid not. She was just throwing up really badly this morning, and I just got her to take some medicine to take the fever down a few degrees, just enough for her to sleep.” Mrs. Brady shook her head. “She needs her rest.”

“I suppose so,” he reluctantly agreed. “But in that case, could you tell me if your daughter spoke to you about anything regarding Elisa before the murder?”

“Are you really implying that my angel had anything to do with it?” she spoke in a hushed tone, and her small frame quickly became full of animated fury. “How dare you! I thought you had come here with a real breakthrough in the case, so I could soothe my child’s broken heart, and instead, you come here and blame her? I knew you pigs were never good for anything!” she spilled her tirade at him, but still quiet enough not to risk waking her daughter.

“Maam, maam, I’m just trying to gather information…” he said as calmly as possible, trying to reassure her. I’m not blaming your daughter, but if perhaps Elisa was killed by a peer over some drama at school, your daughter may be the only person with any real insight into the matter, given how close she was with her.” He watched the anger slowly slip from Mrs. Brady’s face over the course of a tense few moments.

“Hmm, she didn’t speak much of Elisa to me recently,” she finally said, regaining her composure, “But she did go out to a party just the night before…it happened… It was Elisa, my daughter, and her boyfriend, Hunter.”

“And when exactly was this?” Burt asked, writing down the details of the testimony in his notepad.

“This was two days ago, exactly the night of the murder. Hunter came by at around eight, picked up my Jill, and they went to get Elisa as well. Jill came back before eleven, just how I told her to be, and then she was so tired she went straight to bed.” Mrs. Brady recounted, trying to recall all of the details.

“Thank you, then, that would be all,” he said, getting up from the couch.

“And one more thing…” she said, and he could see it in her face that she was conflicted as to whether or not to tell him. “I don’t think you’re going to find the person responsible. I’ve felt a bad presence around our town for the past week, the kind that wasn’t there before. Dark energy. This is not the work of living men but the work of a vengeful, angry spirit, the Wendigo, come to take revenge on our town. It is the fault of white men who brought this evil on us, who stole this land. You won’t find anyone! Only through belief and prayer to the natives to whom this land truly belongs can we be saved,” she ranted to him. In return, he stopped, thinking over her words.

“With all due respect, Mrs., no spirits came to help the natives in their time of need when Old Hickory sent them off, so why would any be here now? The actions of very real bad men are much more real and dangerous than any evil native ghosts. I promise, I’ll do everything in my power to come back here and deliver the news that we’ve caught the bastard responsible as soon as I can. Good day,” he said and walked back out into the snow.

His next step was that Hunter Dugan character. His address brought Burt to an interesting sight. It was a larger, two-story house, considerably newer and much more opulent than many of the others, and yet still somehow worse for wear. A relatively new, large, lifted, and unmistakably broken-down SUV stood parked in the driveway, with a faded “thin blue line” sticker still partly visible on the rear window. He knocked on the door and announced himself, and within a few minutes, a balding middle-aged man with a beard that was short yet patchy opened the door.

“Mr. Dugan, I presume? I’m Sergeant Burt Harrison, local police, and I’d like to ask your son a few questions…” Burt began.

“Oh, what has that…” Mr Dugan caught himself before swearing, “What has he gotten himself into now?”

“It’s about Elisa Morrison, the girl who was found murdered yesterday. Reportedly, your son was one of the last people to see her alive, so I’d like to ask him a few questions.” Burt stated calmly yet confidently, “May I come in?”

“Not without a warrant, you can’t!” Mr. Dugan rejected outright, “Stand here and I’ll bring his sorry ass out here.” And surely, within five minutes, there on the porch stood a tall yet scrawny young man, brown hair swept upwards in a fringe that could double as the brim of a baseball cap. He looked like the type that girls his age would swoon over, complete with a very sharp jawline. However, despite his handsome appearance, there was something about him, perhaps it was just because he got called out into the cold to be interrogated by a police officer, but there was something in his eyes, some hard-to-describe squirrely quality to them.

“Hunter Dugan?” Burt asked, trying to confirm the young man’s identity.

“Yes, sir,” Hunter replied nervously, trying to sound polite.

“When was the last time you saw Elisa Morrison?” Burt asked, carefully studying him.

“Just two days ago, we… I mean, Julia, Elisa, and I were going to a party on 4th Street. Afterwards, we parted ways and Elisa went back home by herself.” Hunter began to recount. In this case, “party” almost certainly meant sitting around somebody’s fire pit smoking or doing some sort of drugs, but now was not the time to press the issue, at least not yet. Still, Burt couldn’t help but think to himself that, of all the things to suffer supply shortages, drugs weren’t one of them.

“Was it your idea to attend the party?” he asked the boy, gauging his reaction.

“I dunno…” Hunter shrugged, “We all thought it be kind of fun, I guess.”

“And Elisa, did she walk back by herself?” he questioned him, “And you didn’t think to be a gentleman and at least walk her back to her home? It's not far from here after all.”

“Well… I also had to take Julia back to her place after all, and that was in the opposite direction…” Hunter stammered, “Well, I just didn’t think of it, I’m sorry.”

“Well, it ain’t me you have to apologize to, I’m afraid,” Burt responded dryly. “And at what time did you get back?”

“About midnight,” he admitted.

“And during the party, did you notice any arguments, disagreements perhaps with Elisa? Was she acting unusually?” Burt asked, although he guessed that someone like Hunter was almost certainly helpless at being able to understand body language or other forms of non-verbal communication unless they were blatantly obvious.

“No, not that I can remember,” the young man said and shook his head, and yet Burt noticed, albeit briefly, Hunter’s eyes darted to the side, avoiding eye contact with him as if he was even just visually trying to dive into the snow and eject himself from this conversation.

“Very well, thank you for your time and cooperation.” Burt nodded and headed off again. He sat in his car for some time, watching as Hunter headed back indoors, and through the windows, he could barely make out the shapes of him and his parents arguing. He compared his notes, Hunter’s testimony to Mrs. Brady’s. Jill had supposedly gotten home at just around eleven, while it took Hunter another hour to make what should have been a ten-minute walk. A suspicion began to brew in his mind, but still, it was yet unfounded. Turning over the ignition, he drove back off to the Morrisons’.

Mrs. Morrison’s home looked just the same as it had when he was there a day ago. A small camping lamp now illuminated the trailer, shedding light on the mess that had been lying around since yesterday. Dirty clothing, blankets, and more heaps of stuff, which Burt couldn’t quite identify, lay thrown about on the floor. Mrs. Morrison had not been able to find the strength in herself to clean up, and he couldn’t blame her. She looked at him from the semi-darkness, eyes wet and red.

“Any news?” she spoke in an almost whisper.

“No, unfortunately, not yet, but I’m putting together a timeline of events,” Burt explained. “Can you remember what time Elisa got back from the party that night?”

“Quarter to midnight or so.” Mrs. Morrison spoke, recalling the time, “I was so mad at her then, but she was so happy, just beaming, oh god, why did I have to be mad at her? Why couldn’t I just have hugged her and told her that I loved her over and over again? I’m so sorry, my baby, I’m so sorry…” she burst into tears once again. Burt sat there, silently. What could he even say? Should he try to reassure her, to tell her that he’s going to catch the person responsible, even if he didn’t even believe that himself? And even if he did, what good would it do to her? Would she even care? Nothing now would bring Elisa back.

“My condolences, once more,” he rasped and then fell silent for some time before speaking again. “We’ll take care of the funeral. Would you like any arrangements done in regard to the church, plot, or date of the burial?” There wasn’t much else he could do with the body. He didn’t have the equipment or expertise to conduct a further, more in-depth autopsy, and the room where her body was kept was cooled but not actually refrigerated, and decay was going to get rid of all of the remaining evidence anyway.

“Tomorrow, at the Lutheran Church on Willow Street. I have a plot there, but I never thought it would be for her…” Tears streamed down her face again. “I want her to be next to her dad.”

She buried her head into his shoulder and cried for a while, until it simply turned into long, deep, sorrowful sobs like a person drowning. And drowning she was, drowning perhaps in despair and hopelessness, drowning because there could be no more surfacing for a breath of fresh air from this. Burt sat there, with an arm around her half-heartedly, staring off into space, watching little bits of dust float by, hearing a fly buzz as it slammed itself head first into one of the windows over and over again, its destination so close yet impossibly far. He smelled the decaying linoleum, the rotting plywood, the rusting sheet metal of the walls. He knew he had to say something, do something, to stop the inevitable, and it tore his heart into shreds knowing that he couldn’t. Elisa would be buried, but this, this corroding bucket would become her mother’s tomb. There was nothing else left for her here.

After Mrs. Morrison had cried herself to sleep on his shoulder, he got up carefully and draped a blanket over her, letting her lie on the couch before getting up and walking out, closing the door behind him. He had Elisa’s body wrapped up and moved over to the church, where they would place her in what casket they could. After that was out of Burt’s control, he concentrated his attention back to the facts of the case. He had investigated what leads he could, and the only thing they’d definitively revealed to him was the inconsistency of the claimed times that each of the teens reportedly had gotten back from the party.

To him, Hunter seemed the most suspicious, but even then, for what? Some disjointed facts and nervous glances? Surely that wasn’t enough to issue a warrant over, and even if he got one, what would he find? A baggie of weed and a bong under his bed, right next to his crusty sock? What was he actually looking for?",0,1753022105.0,creepcast,0,0.5,False

1m4qdtv,https://www.reddit.com/r/LivingEssentials/comments/1m4qdtv/what_is_the_quietest_electric_kettle/,What is the quietest electric kettle?,"As someone who's always on the hunt for the perfect cup of tea, I've gone through my fair share of electric kettles. Recently, I've been focusing on finding the quietest option out there. Let's face it, no one wants to wake up the whole house just to make their morning brew.

After extensive research and testing, I've discovered that the quietest electric kettles tend to have a few things in common. They usually feature a concealed heating element, which reduces noise from boiling water. Many also have a slow-start function that gradually increases the heat, minimizing those initial loud bubbling sounds.

One of the top contenders I've come across is a model with a double-wall design. This not only keeps the water hot for longer but also muffles the sound of boiling. It's a win-win situation - your water stays at the perfect temperature, and you don't have to deal with excessive noise.

Another feature to look out for is automatic shut-off. This isn't just about safety; it also means the kettle won't continue to make noise once the water has reached boiling point. Some advanced models even let you set specific temperatures, which can further reduce noise as the water doesn't always need to reach a full boil.

I've also noticed that the material of the kettle plays a role in noise levels. Glass kettles, while visually appealing, tend to be louder than their stainless steel counterparts. If noise reduction is your primary concern, I'd recommend sticking with metal options.

One unexpected factor in kettle noise is the lid design. A tight-fitting lid can significantly reduce the amount of steam and bubbling sounds that escape. Some of the quietest models I've tested have lids that lock securely in place.

It's worth mentioning that capacity can affect noise levels too. Larger kettles tend to be louder simply because there's more water to heat. If you typically only need a cup or two at a time, opting for a smaller capacity kettle could be a good way to reduce noise.

While researching, I came across a great selection of electric kettles that tick all these boxes. You can check them out here: https://athometouch.com/Electric-Kettle. They've got options for every preference and budget.

Remember, even the quietest kettle will make some noise - it's the nature of boiling water. But with the right features and design, you can significantly reduce the racket and enjoy a more peaceful tea-making experience.

In my experience, the quest for the perfect quiet kettle is well worth it. There's something incredibly satisfying about being able to make a cup of tea or coffee without disturbing anyone else in the house. Plus, it's a small luxury that can make your daily routine just a bit more enjoyable.

So, if you're in the market for a new electric kettle and noise is a concern, keep these factors in mind. Look for concealed heating elements, double-wall designs, automatic shut-off features, and secure lids. With a bit of research, you'll be well on your way to finding the quietest electric kettle for your needs.",1,1753021957.0,LivingEssentials,0,1.0,False
1m4qdjw,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1m4qdjw/th_puppeteer_of_pain_part_1/,[TH] Puppeteer of Pain- Part 1,"Beckett wakes up, her eyes are hazy. She can see a fuzzy glowing orange light in the distance. She feels the floor beneath her - it is cold and hard. The air is filled with a familiar smell. The smell that scares her more than anything in the world. As she comes to, she tries to remember how she got there. Running through all the possibilities in her head. The last thing she remembers is staring into a set of glowing eyes. Her vision clears and that is when she sees it, the fire in the distance. The fear of the situation froze her in her tracks. Paralyzed , Beckett tries everything to get her bearings on the situation. Just then she sees another person in the room with her. Standing up she felt weak, she stumbled over to the other person who was laying on their stomach. She tried yelling and shaking them to wake them up, but her efforts were fruitless. Grabbing their shoulders Beckett flipped them onto their back.  

Staring into the face of the stranger Beckett realizes this is no stranger. It is her daughter.
 
The small town of Springfield, nestled in the heart of Middle America. The quiet streets were lined with old oak trees, their leaves rustling in the breeze. The smell of freshly baked pies wafted from the local bakery, enticing residents to grab a warm treat. Sounds of children playing in the street filled the air. Some would describe Springfield as the perfect postcard town. Each house had a impeccably manicured lawn, nothing seemed out of place. Residents live in harmony and crime is virtually nonexistent. However, beneath the surface, a sinister force lurks.
 
Beckett , a successful event planner lives a comfortable life with her loving family – her husband James, and their two children, Zoe and Jack. She was in her late 30s, average height and a slender build. Her hair was fire red, her face punctuated with freckles across her nose and cheeks. By looking at her she seemed to be a perfectly healthy woman, but the lines in her face made her look 5-10 years older than she was.
 
Beckett grew up in a volatile household with an abusive father and a mother struggling with addiction. She often found herself taking care of her younger sibling, trying to shield them from the chaos. One fateful night, Beckett's father set the house on fire in a drunken rage, and Beckett's younger brother died in the flames. She was unable to save him.
 
These traumatic events left Beckett with survivor's guilt, PTSD, and a deep-seated fear of loss. She worked hard to rebuild her life, eventually finding stability with James and their children.
 
Although, she seems like she has a perfect life now, it is far from it. 
 
Her oldest Zoe, is a problem child. Consistently getting in trouble at school, starting fights with students and staff. Outside of school she commits petty crimes, being arrested a time or two. Things kind of get better at home, she’s always obeying her parents, trying hard to push the ""good girl"" act. Zoe’s “bad girl” persona is her armor. 

She craves attention and connection, especially from her unavailable father and guilt-ridden mother. She feel invisible and acting out is her only way of being seen, even if it is negatively. Zoe is smarter and more emotionally attuned than she lets on, but she distrusts the vulnerability it could bring.
 
Jack on the other hand was a great kid at school. He is in several academic clubs, is the Chairman of the student body council and winning several awards. His problem is his recent drug use. He is trying to shed the ""nerd"" persona and become the popular kid. Deeply insecure and burdened by expectations he wants to be perfect to “make up for” the family’s dysfunction. He secretly fears he’ll never be enough, that his accomplishments are the only reason he’s valued. This is what led to the drug addiction.
 
Lastly we have James, he is a loving enough husband but is not there to support his family. Always at work, working long hours or doing projects around the house in his free time. This made Beckett feel isolated. James is filled with silent guilt, he knows he’s not present, but believes his duty is to work and provide. He finds himself avoiding emotional and physical intimacy because he fears he'll say or do something wrong. He Struggles with the feelings of failure, he knows he’s let Beckett down but doesn’t know how to fix it.
 
These are the things that drove her into another mans arms.
 
 Her world is turned upside down when she meets the charming and handsome, ""Alex."" 
 
Day 1

Beckett was running errands on a sunny Monday morning. The kids were off to school and James as always was at work. She was at the local farmer's market when she bumped into Alex. She was admiring the vibrant flowers, and he accidentally collided with her cart, spilling her produce. Apologetic, he rushed to help her gather the scattered fruits and vegetables. Their hands touched, and a spark of electricity ran through both of them. 
 
Alex stands tall, around 6 foot, with a lean yet athletic build. His dark hair is styled perfectly, framing his chiseled face and bright blue eyes . A strong jawline and subtle stubble add to his charm, while his bright smile can light up a room. He's dressed in dark jeans and a fitted white shirt that accentuates his build. He walks tall with confidence holding his head up and shoulders out.
 
As they wrapped up their shopping trip, their conversation overflowed with the giddy excitement of school kids hiding their secret crushes. With time slipping away, Becket suggested meeting up again in a couple days and they both agreed, already counting down the hours until they could see each other once more.
 
Day 3

Two days later they decided to grab coffee and discovered a shared love for music, hiking, and classic literature. As they sipped their coffee, their conversation flowed effortlessly as if the were old friends or new lovers. They each took a sip and found themselves lost in each other's eyes. The afternoons warmth lingered as they reluctantly stood up to part ways. Alex wrapped his fingers around Beckett's hand, his lips grazing the top in a soft and gentle kiss. As their eyes met, he smiled, his voice low and husky: ""Until next time.""

Beckett returned home with a secretive smile, feeling the euphoria from her date. Her endorphins released, giving her a sense of pure ecstasy – she was on cloud nine. She continued her night as usual, eating dinner and having small talk with her family, cleaning the kitchen, and taking care of the dog. As she started to unwind for the day, a low creaking noise from the old wooden floorboards caught her attention. At first, she thought it was just the house settling, but as the sound persisted and grew louder, the family started to feel uneasy. Doors creaked open on their own, and faint whispers seemed to emanate from the walls. The pipes clanked inside the wall, shaking with an unexplained force. Every door and cabinet would be open when they entered a room.

Day 5

The date began at a quaint Italian restaurant in the city. Beckett arrived first, dressed in a fitted red dress that accentuated her curves, the same one she wore for her engagement party. Alex walked in 10 minutes later, his eyes locking onto hers with a familiar spark. They exchanged a brief, passionate hug before sitting down.

Over a bottle of Merlot, they talked about everything except her spouse. Alex shared stories about his latest photography project, capturing the beauty of abandoned buildings. Beckett spoke about her job, the stress of meeting deadlines, and the creative freedom she craved.

After dinner, they strolled through the nearby park, hand in hand. In the cool evening air the sound of jazz music drifted from a nearby club. They found a secluded spot so not to be bothered and carried on the conversation from earlier.
 
At the same time at home strange accidents start to plague the family. A vase shattered on the floor as Zoe walked by startling her and she let out a scream. James came running, worried that she was hurt and tripped over an invisible obstacle on the stairs causing him to tumble down and sprain his ankle. Jack while in the kitchen had the microwave catch fire while heating up some left overs.The family was on edge trying to make sense of the mishaps.

Day 7

A week after they first met they found themselves wandering around the serene pond, the warm sunlight casting a gentle glow on the surroundings, they decided to capture the moment. They smiled at each other, and with arms wrapped around one another, Alex took a selfie, the picture perfect backdrop adding a touch of magic to the photo. Their stroll around the pond in the local park became a peaceful escape from the world. The sound of birds chirping and leaves rustling in the breeze accompanied their laughter and deep conversations. As they walked, their hands brushed against each other, and eventually, they intertwined their fingers, feeling an undeniable connection. They worked their way to a bench next to the water, Beckett rest her head on his shoulders, a faint smile appeared. Beckett asked Alex to see the picture of their flawless moment together. As she gazed at the photo, a jarring sight caught her off guard - Alex's eyes had transformed into eerie white orbs. Rubbing her eyes in disbelief, she looked again, and relief washed over her as his familiar blue eyes, the ones she had come to love, gazed back.
 
That night Beckett had the most vivid nightmare. Her dream, she swore could have been real. It was like she was there, a member of the crowd, a member of a cult. The room was dark, lit only by candles the smell of sulfur in the air. Strange writings were on the walls and floor, not sure if it was blood or paint. The cult recites a incantation to the deity ""Erebus"". The member chant together-
 
""Per potentiam Orbi Te invocamus Erebum. Da nobis puerum ut iussa tua facias.""

""By the power of the underworld we call upon you Erebus. Give us a child to do your bidding.""
 
Over and over again. Until, in the center of the room a cloud of smoke rises from the floor, masking a human shaped creature, the crowd gathers around. The smoke continues to thicken, without warning two white orbs appear. Beckett jolted up in bed in a cold sweat.

The following morning the strange occurrences continued. Downstairs, the TV flickered to life, displaying a static-filled screen with cryptic messages scrolling by. Beckett's phone buzzed with strange texts, seemingly from unknown numbers. The messages read: ""Erebus stirs"" and ""The child awaits."" Beckett's skin crawled.
 
Panicked, she called Alex to meet with her at the same coffee shop from before.
Alex tried to comfort her, but the images haunt her, making her wonder if her subconscious is trying to tell her something. 
 

Day 9 & 10

As their relationship blossomed, Alex's thoughtful gestures, such as bringing Beckett her favorite flowers and chocolates, showed he was attentive to her interests. His chivalrous acts, like opening doors and covering the bill, made her feel appreciated. With each passing day, their connection grew stronger, and the atmosphere was filled with excitement.

However, the family's situation at home took a concerning turn. The strange occurrences escalated, with Jack sharing with James about seeing shadowy figures out of the corner of his eye and hearing whispers in the walls. As a result, James and the kids became increasingly on edge, while Beckett seemed distant and preoccupied, her behavior changing noticeably.
 
Day 11

After a romantic movie date, Alex invited Beckett to his home, where she was greeted by the aroma of freshly brewed coffee and the soft glow of candles. The evening unfolded with warmth and intimacy, as they sat together on the couch, just inches apart. The tension between them was undeniable, and it seemed only a matter of time before they took the next step.
 
The air was charged with anticipation as Alex and Beckett found themselves alone in the quiet of the night. Their eyes locked, and the tension between them was palpable. They moved closer, their hearts racing in unison.
 
Their first kiss was soft and gentle, a tentative exploration of each other's lips. As they deepened the kiss, their passion grew, and they let go of their inhibitions.
 
The world around them melted away, leaving only the two of them, lost in the moment. Their hands roamed, exploring each other's bodies, and their heavy breathing filled the air.
 
It was a moment of pure ecstasy, a spark that ignited a flame between them. As they pulled away, gasping for air, they knew that their relationship had crossed a threshold, and there was no turning back.
 
Day 12

Beckett woke the next morning, wrapped in his soft silk sheets. She sat up, hair frizzy and make-up smeared. Turning her head she saw Alex laying on his stomach still asleep, she smiled discreetly. Running through her head she tries to remember the last time she felt like this, desired and seen. 
 
It has been years since her and James has had this type of connection. The busy life, children and long hours keep them apart. 
 
Alex stirs bring her attention back to him. She leans over gives him a kiss-
 
""That was amazing but I must get home.""
 
Beckett stands up getting out of bed. Dropping the sheets exposing her bare back, gathers her belongings and heads to the bathroom. She exits, make-up applied, hair styled, clothes fixed just right. It is as if nothing ever happened. She gives Alex one more passionate kiss and heads home.
 
That night her nightmare intensifies. She was back in the dark room, smoke still on the floor. This time it was just her and the creature on the floor. Apprehensively, she approached reaching for it. She touched it, it's skin was cold as if there were no life flowing in its veins, and eerily smooth. The orbs appear again making her jump back. Although it scares her she found herself connected to it. She leans over, wafting the smoke in the air. As the smoke clears she finally sees the creature. Laying on it side, it begins to roll over. When it does it is adorning Alex's face. 

Beckett tossed off the covers, her heart still racing, and got out of bed, trying to shake off the lingering unease. The image of the creature with Alex's face persisted in her mind, leaving her wondering if her subconscious was revealing concerns about their relationship or if the nightmares were just a manifestation of her own fears.

As she headed to the kitchen for a glass of water, she noticed the TV was on, displaying a static-filled screen with the words ""The mask slips"" scrolling by. A shiver ran down her spine as she pondered the meaning behind the message.
 
Day 13

Beckett tried to focus on her daily tasks to shake off the unsettling feeling, but the image of Alex's face on the creature's body lingered in her mind. She couldn't help but notice Alex, searching for any sign that might explain the haunting dream. Was it just her imagination, or was there something more to it? She attempted to push the thoughts aside and focus on the present.

Meanwhile, Jack and Zoe's TV began to malfunction while they were watching a movie, displaying strange messages. Beckett started experiencing eerie visions during the day, similar to her dreams. The visions seemed to blur the lines between reality and illusion.

Jack and Zoe shared similar experiences with Beckett, describing tall, slender shadows on the walls that seemed to follow them. The family was on edge, struggling to find a logical explanation for the strange events. The tension continued to build as they wondered what would happen next.

Day 14

The sunny afternoon found Beckett and Alex lounging in a secluded hot tub at a luxurious resort on the outskirts of town. The water bubbled around them, and sweet aroma of nearby blooming flowers filled the air.

As they sipped champagne, Alex's hands wandered over Beckett's body, his fingers tracing the curves of her shoulders and breasts. Beckett laughed, feeling carefree and alive.

After their relaxing soak, they dressed in comfortable clothes and strolled through the resort's gardens, hand in hand. They sat on a bench overlooking a serene lake, watching as a family of ducks glided across the water.

Alex turned to Beckett, his eyes locked onto hers. ""I love the way you make me feel,"" he said, his voice low and husky. Beckett's heart skipped a beat as she replied, ""I feel the same way about you.""

Beckett and Alex's relationship brought each other comfort, and intimate moments helped ease her tension. However, upon entering her house, the door slammed shut on its own, and the whispers in the walls grew louder. Beckett tried to compose herself as she entered the living room, where she found her family sitting exhausted on the couch. They looked drained, struggling to sleep and feel safe in their own home.

Day 15

After lunch, Beckett and Alex decided to take a nap, but it quickly turned into a sensual massage session. Alex's hands kneaded Beckett's muscles, easing her tension, while Beckett's fingers traced the muscles of Alex's chest.

As the afternoon wore on, they got dressed and went for a romantic walk. The sun cast a glow over the water, and the sound of birds filled the air. They stopped at a picturesque spot, and Alex pulled Beckett close, his lips brushing against her ear.

""You make every day feel like a dream,"" he whispered. Beckett's heart fluttered as she replied, ""You're my reality now.""

Their evening ended with a private dance session in Alex's apartment, the music was seductive. They swayed to the rhythm, their bodies pressed together, lost in the intimacy of the moment.

Her affair was intense and all consuming. Filling a void in Beckett's life that her marriage had left untouched. Beckett and Alex's sexual relationship continued in secret, with stolen moments whenever they could manage them without arousing suspicion.

Day 21

And then, just as suddenly as it started, everything stops. The house went quiet, the devices function normally, and the visions cease. The family breathes a collective sigh of relief, thinking it's finally over.

Day 22

The next morning Beckett woke with the sun shining on her face. The first thought to run through her mind was what her and Alex would do today? Sitting up she realized the bed was empty, James was gone. She went to check on the children and they were missing as well.

The rooms were silent, the furniture is still, and the doors are closed. It's as if they vanished into thin air, leaving behind the slightest indication of their existence and the haunting question: what happened to them?
 
After Beckett's family vanished, she sought out Alex. She was distraught and cried into his chest explaining everything that has happened. Alex squeezed her tight as to comfort her. Suddenly he steps back and revealed himself. 
 
In his true form, Alex's body contorts and twists, defying human anatomy. His skin ripples and flows like a liquid shadow, shifting between dark, muted colors that seem to absorb the light around him. His arms long and skinny, yet strong, ended with hands big enough to palm a person’s head. The fingers long and fragile, tipped with sharp nails.
 
His face, long and featureless, a smooth expanse, punctuated only by two glowing orbs that burn with an otherworldly energy. The orbs seem to bore into your very soul, filling you with a sense of dread and unease.
 
He informs her-
""I am Erebus, the reason all of this has been happening to you. I need the fear, the loss, and the dread, for I feed on the pain of the people I manipulate, growing stronger each time to reincarnate my true self.""

 Indeed, Alex's very existence is a twisted mockery of humanity, meticulously designed to generate and exploit pain and suffering. With this power, Erebus now ensnares Beckett in a series of gruesome and psychologically taxing challenges from which there is no escape. He can manipulate reality at will, ensuring her confinement. Each trial is crafted to test her humanity, her love for her family, and her willingness to make impossible choices.
 
While in his natural state,  Erebus stands tall over Beckett, looming over head. He hunches down eyes starting to glow. Beckett speechless, just stares at his vast expansive face, being drawn into the light of his eyes and blacks out.

Note: Names will be changed but concept will remain the same



Hi Reddit, I'm looking for advice on a situation that's escalated. 

My (Brian) ex boyfriend (Kevin) who i dated for 2 years and we proceeded to have a 2 year long semi romantic and sexual relationship with 2 years after the breakup cheated on his girlfiend (Mylie) the very night he made things official with her by coming home from that date and sex with her and sexxting me. I discover he was in a relationship and after 3 weeks i force him to confess to her and she issues a no contact rule between myself and Kevin and I am blocked on all social media without any emotional closure.

. About five weeks after the affair came to light, a burner Instagram account started viewing my stories very late at night — despite me having no connections it. it was created December 2024 meaning it was created before the incident (cheating occured March 29th, no contact rule implemented April 21st)

The account (username similar to “ylian872”) had a suspicious name structure — “YLI” possibly referencing Mylie and “AN” possibly a fragment of the middle letters of her surname. I message the account after a week of its surveillance asking what it's doing and saying i'm not mad. it responds by changing it's profile picture to a black screen. I get a bit more annoyed and i message the account again accusing it of being Mylie and threatening to tell Kevin. It blocks me and also my undisclosed alt.  which only Kevin knew about because i used it to message kevin after the no contact rule asking for emotional closure, suggesting insider knowledge.

When I confronted  Mylie with my logical deduction and ask for an apology, she acts very bizarrely, she makes her private account public, shows off her holiday stories and then blocks me after i see them. I get more pissed off and i message again saying ""is this your way of telling me you were behind the account"" she responds by saying ""As you said, i'm on holiday. you're the last thing on my mind. leave me in peace"" and blocks me. I get even more uncomfortable after 2 weeks i message my ex and tell him my reasons for suspecting his new gf was behind that account and express my discomfort at her way of treating me. I am left on delivered. I get even more persistent and i am met by being blocked by both regardless of message despite being level headed. I get extremely frustrated and threaten to go to Kevin's house if he doesn't just have a conversation with me over my concerns about being stalked. He issues a vague apology saying ""i'm sorry if she spied on you"" and ""she didn't mean any harm"" and ""she didn't think it was healthy to speak to you"" and then i am sent an extremely long legal document saying i am harassing and threatening and not allowed message him, his gf or speak to any of their friends or family members ever again. I get scared and back away. it's been a month since and now I heard through a friend that Mylie claimed i made everything up and she swallowed her pride and had Kevin apologise to me for the greater good  and to just make the unstable ex go away and that she bets the account never even existed. Her bf also saying he bets the account never even existed. I have screenshots of that account's activity. I didn't make it up.

I’ve documented everything and i messaged two of Kevin's close friends with my evidence against her (as he has no legal right to stop me from speaking to his friends) and I have said I am considering legal action. None of them blocked me or unfollowed me. I also sent a message to Mylie saying I am seriously considering having that account investigated. She didn't respond at all despite hours passing and also hasn't blocked. .

My circumstantial evidence includes: The burner account suspiciously being derived from the middle letters of her first and last name, the timeline of 5 weeks after infidelity fits documented behavioural patterns in women who stay in relationships after affairs, she knew what my instagram handle was (my instagram handle doesn't include my real name), and the account knew that my alt was me despite me only disclosing that to Kevin, the account monitored for a week and responded passive aggressively and blocked when i questioned if it was Mylie, Mylie benefits from silencing me entirely with that overcorrecting legal threat, Mylie did not deny her involvement in the burner and instead made her account public to show off her holidays and then responded hostilely when questioned again, i see no other plausible reason an account could be that invested in a man with about 400 instagram followers who just posts memes on his story and the occasional beer,  coffee, or dog photo, she had access and motive (insecurity after the cheating with an emotionally significant ex), and the changing of the narrative to paint me as delusional and unstable despite privately apologising through her boyfriend seems emotionally manipulative to me. 

**My questions are:**

1. Am I overthinking this, or does my deduction seem sound?
2. Is it reasonable/legal to go to the police over this kind of online behavior and now the behaviour of denying this ever happened?
3. How should I proceed if Mylie continues to ignore me?
4. Has anyone else been in a similar situation involving burner accounts and emotional manipulation?

1m4qa6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/WannaGoPlaces/comments/1m4qa6u/how_to_spend_a_day_in_sacramento/,How to spend a day in Sacramento?,"Just got back from an incredible day trip to Sacramento and I wanted to share my experience since I found some hidden gems that made the trip unforgettable.

Sacramento might not be the first city that comes to mind when planning a California adventure, but trust me - there's something special about our state capital that keeps drawing visitors back.

I started my morning at the historic Old Sacramento Waterfront District. The cobblestone streets and Gold Rush-era buildings transport you back in time. Pro tip: grab breakfast at Steamers - their fresh pastries and coffee are perfect fuel for a day of exploring.

The California State Capitol Museum was next on my list. The architecture is stunning, and the free guided tours offer fascinating insights into California's political history. The surrounding Capitol Park is beautiful too - perfect for photos.

Here's where my day took an unexpected turn - I discovered an amazing whitewater rafting experience just outside the city. After some research, I booked a half-day trip on the South Fork American River through [this link](https://athometouch.com/Sacramento). Best decision ever! The guides were incredibly knowledgeable, the rapids were exciting but not scary, and they even provided lunch with homemade brownies. It's perfect for families or anyone looking to add some adventure to their Sacramento visit.

After rafting, I headed to the Midtown district for dinner. This neighborhood is a food lover's paradise. Try Mulvaney's B&L if you're feeling fancy, or hit up Coconut's Fish Cafe for amazing fish tacos.

For art enthusiasts, the Crocker Art Museum is a must-visit. It's the oldest art museum west of the Mississippi, featuring an impressive collection of California art and European masterpieces.

A few practical tips:
- Parking can be tricky downtown. Use garage parking or consider rideshare
- Summer gets hot, so plan indoor activities during peak afternoon hours
- Most museums are closed on Mondays
- Book activities like rafting in advance, especially during peak season

Sacramento offers this perfect blend of history, outdoor adventure, and urban culture. Whether you're here for a day or a week, you won't run out of things to do.

If you're planning to visit, I highly recommend including that rafting trip in your itinerary. It added such an unexpected thrill to my Sacramento experience. You can check availability and book directly [here](https://athometouch.com/Sacramento).

1m4q8lx,https://www.reddit.com/r/TVFreeHub/comments/1m4q8lx/memecoin_madness_the_wild_world_of_crypto_jokes/,😜 Memecoin Madness: The Wild World of Crypto Jokes Turned Millions! 🚀,"Hey crypto bros and meme lords! Buckle up for a wild ride into the absurdly awesome world of **memecoins**—where internet jokes, cute dogs, and pure chaos can turn pocket change into millions (or a big fat zero 😅). Let’s dive into why these silly tokens are the crypto market’s guilty pleasure and how they keep defying logic in 2025.

# What’s a Memecoin, Anyway?

Memecoins are cryptocurrencies born from internet memes, viral trends, or straight-up trolling. Think **Dogecoin (DOGE)**, the granddaddy of them all, inspired by a Shiba Inu meme in 2013, or **PEPE**, the frog that hopped from Reddit to billion-dollar market caps. They’re not about fancy tech or solving world hunger—just pure, unfiltered *hype* fueled by social media and communities like Reddit and Telegram.

*Fun fact*: Dogecoin started as a joke to mock crypto hype but ended up being backed by Elon Musk himself. One tweet from him, and BOOM—prices moon!

# Why Are Memecoins So Addictive?

* **They’re Cheap AF**: Most memecoins cost less than a coffee. You can buy millions of tokens for a few bucks, dreaming of that 1000x pump.
* **Community Vibes**: Memecoin fans are like a cult (in a good way). From Twitter to Telegram, these communities hype their coins like it’s a 24/7 party. Look at **Bonk (BONK)** on Solana—its community turned it into a top-5 memecoin just by sheer enthusiasm.
* **FOMO is Real**: When you see a coin like **dogwifhat (WIF)** skyrocket 900% in a week because some whale bought in, you *need* to jump on the train. One trader turned $310 into $1.4M with WIF—talk about life-changing!

# Top Memecoin Stars of 2025 🌟

1. **Dogecoin (DOGE)**: The OG memecoin. Still kicking with a $36B market cap, thanks to Elon’s tweets and its use for tipping online. Steady, but don’t expect crazy 100x gains anymore.
2. **PEPE**: The frog that won’t quit. Launched in 2023, it’s now a Reddit darling with a $5.5B market cap. Its secret? Pure meme power and zero shame.
3. **Bonk (BONK)**: Solana’s meme king. With 660,000 holders and a $2.75B market cap, it’s more than a joke—it’s a movement. Plus, low Solana fees make trading it a breeze.
4. **dogwifhat (WIF)**: A Shiba Inu in a hat? Why not! This one hit $4.88 at its peak, and its 47% weekly pumps keep traders buzzing.
5. **AI Rig Complex (ARC)**: A new kid on the block, up 72% in a week. It’s riding the AI hype on Solana, proving memecoins can latch onto trendy themes like AI.

# The Catch: It’s a Rollercoaster 🎢

Memecoins are *wildly volatile*. One day you’re up 600%, the next you’re eating instant noodles. Scams are real too—think **Slerf (SLERF)**, where a dev accidentally burned $10M of funds. Ouch! Always scan downloads with antivirus and avoid sketchy sources. And yeah, one dude got hacked after downloading a dodgy memecoin wallet, so stick to trusted platforms like Binance or Uniswap.

*Pro tip*: Check community vibes on Telegram or Reddit. A strong, active community (like BONK’s) is a good sign. Weak chatter? Probably a rug pull waiting to happen.

# How to Join the Meme Party

1. **Find the Buzz**: Follow Telegram channels like Memcrypted or crypto YouTubers for hot new coins.
2. **Buy Smart**: Use exchanges like Binance or DEXs like Uniswap. Check tokenomics—locked liquidity and transparent teams are a must.
3. **HODL or Trade**: Some hodl for the long game (like DOGE fans), others flip for quick gains. Set a strategy and stick to it!
4. **Stay Safe**: Only invest what you can lose. Memecoins are a gamble, not a retirement plan.

# The Future of Memecoins: More Absurdity?

Despite crashes like Libragate wiping out 60% of memecoin market cap in 2025, these tokens keep coming back like a cat with nine lives. With $47.9B still in the game, names like **Fartcoin** and **Buttcoin** prove the circus isn’t over. AI-themed memecoins like ARC are the new hotness, blending memes with tech trends. Who knows? The next big memecoin might be born in a random Telegram group right now.

Hey, AI fam! 🧠💡

Have you ever had that gut-wrenching thought while scrolling through job postings? You see titles like ""AI Strategy Consultant"" or ""Machine Learning Specialist,"" and you think, *Am I even qualified for this?* It’s a little anxiety-inducing, isn’t it? Well, here’s the reality check: **if you're not constantly learning, you're lagging behind.** But it doesn't have to feel overwhelming! 

Let’s face it: the AI world is buzzing and mutating faster than your last failed sourdough starter. One minute you feel on top of your game, and the next, BAM! New tools, new skills, and everyone around you seems to know more. Ever feel like your money flow from AI projects is about to hit a dry spell? 🤯

Here’s why upskilling is crucial right now:

- **It’s a Skills Arms Race**: Seriously, the tech field is all about who knows the latest and greatest. If you’re not up-to-date, others will be, leaving you scrambling. 
- **The Pay Gap**: Did you know that those who invest in learning AI are often five-figure miles ahead in their earnings? It’s like putting your money where your mouth is!
- **Networking**: The more you learn, the more you can connect and collaborate with like-minded folks. Remember the quote, ""Your network is your net worth""? Spot on!

Here are *three* practical ways to kickstart your upskilling journey:

1. **Online Courses**: Places like Coursera or Udemy have tons of great resources. But if you want something a bit more tailored, check out [Imagine AI’s affiliate program](https://whop.com/imagine-education-ai/?a=liveitupdeals) which could have precisely what you need!
   
2. **Join Communities**: You’re in one right now! Join discussions, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to share your struggles. Seriously, we’re all in this together! 

3. **Real-World Projects**: Apply what you learn to tangible projects. It’s like practice makes perfect, but with added enthusiasm (and maybe some coffee)!

So, what’s the takeaway? **Invest in yourself—make learning a priority now!** Before you know it, you’ll be the go-to AI guru in your circle, and hey, those dollars will start flowing again.

Now, I’m curious—what’s the latest skill you’ve picked up (or want to pick up)? Is there anything specific you’re struggling with on your upskilling journey? Let’s chat about it!",1,1753021493.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False

1m4q0dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AFIB/comments/1m4q0dh/running_with_afib_31m/,Running with AFib - 31M,"I (31M) got sidelined by paroxysmal AFib that started up a few months ago. Since then, I get episodes daily that can last between 5 minutes and 5 hours. While I was waiting on results from a two week holter monitor, I went through some serious panic attacks and lack of sleep. I finally got the results, confirmed the diagnosis, and was referred to an EP.

I used to be an avid runner, at least for the past couple of years. I ran my first marathon in January of this year. Since my AFib started in April, I've run occasionally but I'm down to about once a week now. My cardiologist and EP both said they want me to keep running, but it makes me nervous. I never run during an episode. My fear around running is that I'm putting extra strain on my heart, since it goes through multiple high BPM episodes during the day. Of course sudden cardiac event is on top of mind as well, although my doctors have tried to clear me of that worry. 

They started me on 25mg metroprolol 2x day, but had to discontinue since my resting heartrate was dropping into the low/mid 30s. I also didn't see any relief from the episodes with it, but it did help with the anxiety. Mentally, I'm in a better place now than I was a few weeks ago and have somewhat come to accept the inconvenience of my heart beating like popcorn in a microwave once or twice a day.

My EP wants to do a PFA ablation, likely in October.

Extra things to note:  
\-My doctor believes its likely genetic (my paternal grandma has it) but also may have been triggered by endurance exercise  
\-He also insists that I will not go away on its own, but will likely ease up and intensify in waves  
\-I am otherwise healthy with no underlying issue. Not overweight. NIHSS score is 0. I drink much less than I used to as I get older, down to about one or two drinks per week.  
\-One cup of coffee a day, sometimes two. Never get episodes directly after caffeine.

Anyone out there also struggling with AFib but still running? Has anyone done the ablation and been able to run worry free afterwards? Any light at the end of the tunnel? I want to hear about your experience!",2,1753020984.0,AFIB,4,1.0,False
