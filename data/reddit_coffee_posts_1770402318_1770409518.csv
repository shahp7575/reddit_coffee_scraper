1qxstfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/AMA/comments/1qxstfh/i_am_10_years_sober_today_ama/,I am 10 years sober today. AMA,"2/6/16 I couldn’t keep going the way I was going and decided it was time to make a change.

I had always been a bit of a wild card ever since I was a teenager. I had a good childhood and great parents. I started smoking weed in 7th grade by high school was getting wasted with the boys on the reg definitely more than my peers. By my early 20s it was drinking every night then popping e and doing coke every night too. After some traumatic stuff in my personal life in my mid 20s, instead of dealing with my emotions I hit the gas pedal, and before you knew it I was taking 4-6 mg of xans a day on top of drinking, coke benders and any and every drug I could get my hands on 24/7. Drugs were my life and I was synonymous with drugs. It’s what I did and what people knew me for, that fucked up guy. My real friends were all long gone, now it was just randoms I’d meet out while getting fucked up, like some big addiction echo chamber. It went like this for years until one day in February 2016. I woke up in my driveway in the driver seat of my truck, no idea where I was or how I got there. Last thing I remember I was out for a quick drink the night before. Blackout were happening more frequently and for longer periods of time. Genuine blackout where no matter how hard I tried I couldn’t remember what had happened. I lived with lots of guilt and shame, and was ready for it to be over. I had a plan for how I was going to cash out. For whatever reason that day I felt desperate, I googled for an AA meeting in my area and there was one down the street. I walked over to it sat down drank some shitty coffee and thought, “this is some fuckin bullshit”. An older guy saw me there and bought me a copy of the big book, I walked home and read it under the tree out front of my house. I came back the next day. 

The next few months were hell for me, withdrawals from the benzos genuinely made me want to give up. It was honestly close to two years before that was done. I was fragile and broken, but I was determined. I spent a lot of time alone that first while, then I went off to a remote job far away from everything I knew for years. Eventually I met my wife, we have two beautiful children now and some days I can’t believe this is my life. I can’t say I think I deserved this, but I am grateful every day for them and I shower them with 100% of my time and presence. 

It’s been a weird trip the last 10 years, I don’t really have anyone in my life that wants to hear about this story so if anyone wants to know anything about the journey please free to ask. And anyone out there struggling, just know that it is possible change and that your past does not have to define your future. With gratitude and respect, AMA. ",1,1770409454.0,AMA,0,1.0,False

 It wasn’t a disaster at first. We had good conversations lots of scanned badges even booked follow ups. But when I look back at the week, it’s hard to pinpoint  anything concrete that actually moved.

What messed with me was watching how different people experienced the same event. Some reps looked fried by day two sprinting booth to booth. Others were oddly calm, ducking out for coffees not stressing at all.

I keep wondering if that calm comes from experience or if they just did the work before hopping on the plane. This was my third big show and I still feel like I’m guessing half the time.

Another day, I had a short, normal conversation with one of her friends in the library (just small talk about what we study, work, etc.). During that conversation I mentioned that I wasn’t sure how to ask her out.

Later that evening, instead of asking her directly, I gave that same friend a short note to pass along. The note said I’d like to take her out for coffee and that she could text me if she was interested. I was trying to keep it low-pressure and respectful.

It’s now been 2 days and I haven’t heard anything, so I’m not planning to follow up and I’m prepared to take it as a no. I’m more interested in learning than salvaging anything.

Today I ran into her and her friend at the library. I said “hi guys” and waved in passing, and they both said hi back normally. As we walked past each other, I heard them giggle.

About 2 hours later I run into them again on the same open area and decided to strike up a convo and noticed she started standing behind her friend while I was in the same space and was looking at the floor. I might be overthinking it, but it felt notable.

At the same time, they keep coming to the same areas I’m at, which makes me think they don’t feel uncomfortable around me.",1,1770409232.0,Crushes,1,1.0,False
1qxspvb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxspvb,GS book arrived- some photos,"My GS book was delivered today. I've seen some of the other commentary about how the book is a cash grab, not worth the money, and how it’s almost entirely made up of photographs with little supporting text.  Each to their own, I guess, but it is a gorgeous coffee table book which is exactly what I wanted.

It is beautifully put together and constructed. Presenting the history of GS’s timepieces requires a deep dive in visual presentation and I think this book does that. Yes, it comes with a relatively premium price tag but it’s a conversation piece and will look beautiful wherever it’s placed. The patterned wood exterior sleeve is very very cool and the whole book experience feels very Japanese.

We are a diverse group, which I hope to maintain. We are in our 30s and 40s, and all on the nerdy side. After the low-stakes poker game we usually spend a few hours playing arcade games, foosball, sharing youtube memes, and just goofing around.

I've started hitting the gym 3 weeks ago, and I think I reached the point where I'd like someone to join me as I started to find it a bit boring going alone:(
Well, cuz I'm on a 1-year MSc program, I didn't have the chance to make any friends honestly, especially with my classmates as I have different modules in different programs, which means that I'm seeing new faces for every module. And my late arrival last semester made it even worse!
I loathe this loneliness on campus! If I had to eat alone, hangout alone, attend lectures alone etc.. at least, I wanna make the gym more enjoyable!
Ive tried joining societies, morning coffees, some events etc.. everyone seems to have their own circle and not willing to add new people. Even when I step outside my comfort zone and talk to strangers on campus, the best case scenario is that we'd follow each others on IG and that's it! No overlapping plans etc.
So
Is there anyone interested?
I go to the gym in the sport center in tbh e weekdays, no fixed times honestly it depends on when I wake up, open to reschedule

He paid for his coffee, indicated I would pay for my own food (which had just arrived), and left quickly. I called him out and said he invited me he said “sorry I’m too stressed” payed and left.

We produce very small batches of cold brew (and sometimes hot brew), which we filter and can. We’ve been asked hundreds of times—since there’s no other RTD coffee in our country—if we could sell it outside of our brewery.

I was wondering: could an autoclave do the job of a retort, since it uses pressure and high temperatures? Another idea was to tunnel-pasteurize the cans and then send samples to a lab to check for bacteria, yeast, mold, etc. The idea would be to keep the product strictly refrigerated.

Otherwise, the only real options would be a retort, UHT with aseptic filling, right? Is there even any preservatives that could do the work ?

1qxslsx,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qxslsx/i_broke_no_contact/,I broke no contact,"I (24F) and my partner (24M) broke up a few weeks ago. 

  
Our relationship was perfect when it started- I fully believed he was my soulmate. Everything about him I fell so deeply in love with. He was so kind, sweet, he had the prettiest smile I had ever seen. I loved his laugh, how he'd sing all the songs I LOVED. He'd make me feel like the most special girl in the world.

  
If you had asked a week ago- I'd skip this part and immediately jump into in self guilt. 

  
It started getting rocky when I came back from a vacation; he'd get jealous of me being with friends. He'd accuse me of hooking up with friends, he stopped sending me cute things on instagram and TikTok. I suffer from manageable (at the time, hop back to that) depression and anxiety, and he has BPD. So, there would be times I'd have panic attacks or depressive episodes and be unable to do anything but be sad. He would leave me there, and it really hurt.. He would watch me cry or have full blown panic attacks and give me like a sentence of advice, then leave. This was common for him to just leave. There was one day I woke up to him trying to go through my phone, but the passcode wasn't changed (I was discussing with my sister the day before about potentially leaving him). My phone was locked for an hour due to incorrect password attempts.

  
I was there for him during his episodes. I'd deescalate the situation, hold him while he cried, reassure him. There was never any reassurance on my end, unless it was forced or he seemed annoyed with his response. He also just sort of became distant, not as happy around me. Didn't look at me with love, stopped smiling. It destroyed me. 

The months after May- my friend had passed away, an ex boyfriend had passed away, my veryyyy loved cat passed away, I discovered my friend who disappeared prior had passed away. I've never dealt with grief before- nobody has ever passed away close to me. So all this grief stressed me out to the point I had my first multiple sclerosis attack.

On top of all the deaths, I got diagnosed with MS. I had watched my mom suffer from MS my entire life. It felt like all my dreams got crushed that day in the hospital. I lost my dreams of wanting children, wanting a future, wanting anything out of life but to live in the moment. But all my future plans flew out the window. I became depressed, the kind of depressed you fake a smile every day just so people around you don't hate you.

  
He also lost his job around that time, so I was financially supporting most of our activities. He never tried to get a job after losing his.

  
The first month of being diagnosed, October now, I was fine. The major depression didn't hit. I had music festivals and a bunch of October plans. I dragged my partner along, and when I say he was miserable during all these events- I mean it. 4 days in Vegas, and he was just angry and miserable the whole time. A concert, miserable; any hobby or activity was miserable. I stayed hoping I'd get that wonderful boy back.

  
But I know I wasn't a saint. I'd spent 5/7 of my days depressed, anxious, wanting to die. And the other two days were just numb enough to where I could attempt to be the girl I was before. But even when I tried to be her, he was so miserable and brought down my positive attitude. But there would also be days he'd be that same guy I fell in love with. He'd bring me lunch to work, or a coffee. Now that I'm typing that out- it was few and far between. I never saw a lot of the old him.

I put a lot of my mental health struggles on him. I regret that. December and January I'd say how I didn't want to be here, how I just wanted to die. Threaten? No, but express how my life just doesn't seem livable anymore. I feel guilt for that, but also in January I sucked it up and started seeing a therapist again which made things way more manageable. 

  
Our break up was caused a few weeks ago. We had gone on an okay date that day- but I really missed seeing him happy. I missed affection and intimacy, I missed being treated on dates, and I missed when he planned dates. So I communicated how I wasn't happy, how I missed all those things. And he basically told me he didn't trust me because he got a text on his phone a few weeks prior; it was an unknown number explaining how she wanted to go down on him. He claimed it was me, and also accused me of trying to hack into his twitter; which I didn't even know he had. I got mad, I was fed up at this point. Basically I flipped out on him, which is something I'd never done before. And I regret that. He didn't deserve that. 

  
He broke up with me over text. Saying he wasn't happy, he didn't love himself and goodbye. I didn't argue, I just said ""goodbye"".

  
I've been mourning him- not the one I dated as of recent, I think I fell out of love with him. But I am so deeply in love with the idea of who he was when we met. I loved that man so much. He was the most perfect angel in the world. I wish none of this would have happened. He was the most amazing person. He was amazing to and for me, and I know I'll never find, nor want to find a connection like that again. That guy, the one he was, was my soulmate.

  
Basically, I broke no contact. I emailed him. I apologized for what I did, took accountability. I told him how this relationship looked from my perspective; how he seemed miserable and out of love with me. How it was hard and I can't sleep at night without knowing what I did during the summer to make him fall out of love with me.

  
He sent a really cruel message back. He basically told me he fell out of love with me and started resenting me when I was feeling suicidal. He didn't take accountability for the things he put me through. He placed all the blame on me.. And it hurt. I guess that's what I deserved for breaking contact, but holy shit it hurt to read that. I feel guilt, but also being without him the past two weeks I've had so much motivation. Rereading texts with my sister dating from August about how I wanted to leave, how I didn't know how, how I wish he'd be that beautiful guy again. She asked me in September if I saw myself marrying him, I said ""no but I would marry him if he was the same guy he was the first 6 months of our relationship"". and somehow those texts gave way more closure than anything he texted me.

  
I'm doing better now, and it's been two weeks since we broke up. I've reapplied to school, I am currently planning my European backpacking trip, I developed a steady friend group. I'm moving out of my parents house after my trip in May. I got diagnosed with ADHD, and potentially for either BPD or Bipolar 2. Which, in retrospect I do better on my own and single, so BPD would make sense. I feel better without him, but damn if I'm not mourning that sweet boy I fell in love with the most.

Because it was too expensive then I had to give up thypoo (£1) because we always ran out of milk or bread and I felt so bad because I brought tea bags

I called him selfish saying I've made all these sacrificed and you promised me you cancelled all of these.

Actually only having a single wage is stopping me having to support everyone and he only gets £200 a month we'll mist likely more as he's been lying about £68. The rent and bills the missed tome with my kids because I have to leave an hour earlier and get home later in the evening.

This was a pretty unusual week. Multiple work lunches, multiple late nights at work, and having a guest. I'm a bit in flux with a new job and pay structure. So need to review and get debt payoff planned.

1qxsiwj,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qxsiwj/i_want_to_do_my_boss/,i want to do my boss,"so this is kind of embarrassing but also kind of funny to me.

i've been having all these really intense sexual fantasies about my boss, and the funny part is that he probably thinks i'm just… normal. like cheerful, living my life, doing my job, not thinking about him at all. and honestly he probably doesn't think about me much anymore either. but what he absolutely cannot imagine is how much i've thought about him sexually since then. like, at all. and the fact that he has no idea somehow makes it hotter? which sounds insane but it really does.

anyway. this all started when i went on a work trip with him. before that, i'd only ever seen him on video calls. literally just a face on a screen. very dry, very calm, not flirty at all. kind of boring on paper, honestly.
we ended up staying at the same hotel. just coincidence. and at some point i asked him if he was hungry, and we went out to eat together. it wasn't supposed to be a big thing, but we ended up hanging out for hours. then we went to a cafe too, just sat there and talked. he paid for my coffee without making it weird or anything.

while we were there, i asked him what he was up to later, just casually, and he told me there was a big football game that night. then he started asking if i wanted to come with him. at first it was light, then he asked again, like asking which seats i preferred. i kind of responded by saying i'd prefer sitting next to him so he could explain things to me.
then we went back to the hotel, and later he asked again. i said i'd stay in the hotel because i had stuff to do or whatever. honestly i don't even know why i said no. i think i was overwhelmed. different city, first time traveling alone, a lot going on in my head.

the next day at work, things felt… different. when i called his name to ask for help, he winked at me. like actually winked. then there was this thing at the office where everyone brought desserts, and he asked where mine was. i said i didn't have time to get one, and he was like 'don't worry, i'll get it for you,' with this cheeky smile. i remember pretending i didn't care.

also he's kind of a dry person. like objectively. his jokes are borderline childish. one time i told him his mic sounded like he was calling from a pool and he just goes, completely straight, 'well, it's not summer yet.' normally i would cringe so hard. but with him it was just… cute? like he's just so normal.

there was also this moment during my evaluation where we were sitting next to each other, and i swear i could not stop noticing him physically. like, i remember looking at him and thinking… damn, does he know how nice his ass is? like genuinely. it's kind of big, kind of juicy, in a really good way. and i remember feeling ridiculous for even noticing, but i definitely did.

while he was reviewing me, he was smiling and grinning a lot, and i was just sitting there pretending like i didn't give a fuck. very composed. very professional. meanwhile i was actually loving sitting next to him and feeling his presence like that. i felt good around him. comfortable. a little charged.
and yeah, honestly, i wouldn't mind fucking him.

at some point i think i hurt his ego a bit. i asked someone else for help right in front of him when he was already helping me. he made a snarky comment back, which honestly was fair. after that there was this slight fallout vibe. not dramatic, just colder. then we kind of fixed it by joking again and me telling him about my weekend and stuff.
after the trip everything went back to normal. we don't see each other anymore. just meetings, calls, very professional. normal boss stuff.
but every time i talk to him, i like getting his attention. and from what i can tell, he really likes doing things for a woman. it turns me on a lot. the paying, the showing off, the stepping in.

and the crazy part is that he probably thinks none of this exists. meanwhile i keep thinking about the hotel room, the coffee, the game he asked me to come to, the possibilities of what could've happened if i hadn't said no. and yeah, if he ever gave me a sign now, i'd probably go for it.",0,1770408791.0,confessions,3,0.5,False

1qxsi9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1qxsi9m/odvm_special_event_thy_will_be_done_ch_3/,ODVM Special Event: Thy Will Be Done Ch 3,"Sister Catherine - Centris - Dauntless Sick Bay 

She’s old, and she is dying. She knows it as surely as anyone. It’s unfair, in a sense, that she had come so far only for her body to give out now. For whatever the doctor had called it to catch up to her. 

So many long years of service. Of faith and duty. 

All of it oh so very worthwhile. She had been arrested three times in her work as a Dominican sister. Held at gunpoint by militants at least a dozen times. Had watched countless of her seniors go to the side of Christ, mostly from age and illness, the very wolves that stalked her footsteps even now as she lay in this hospital bed. She had cared for the sick and downtrodden in every clime and place that she could reliably reach on foot. Such is her order's mission. Such is how they best served the Lord in all His guises.

Such was her ministry. Such were her vows. Almost behind her now.

Her mind slips away, darkness claiming her. Be it the sleep of rest or the sleep of the final peace she doesn't know; she knows nothing... and then, just as suddenly as the darkness had come, light returns, and she remembers. 

She remembers when she heard the Call. 

It had been on a trip - one final trip, if she’s honest with herself. To visit beautiful, splendid churches across the world and to tour the Holy Land. They’d started in Northern Europe and made their way south, with the Holy Land being the great shining promise at the end of the route . 

A package tour for aging brothers, sisters and priests. Somewhere between a pilgrimage and a holiday, but a very enjoyable one for all that. 

She had heard the call before, and while she'd been on that trip, she heard the call again. It had started with troubled dreams. Not that her dreams hadn’t been frequently troubled, if she was at all honest. She might have lived in a convent and might have been a sister, but even - *especially* \- as a young woman, she had seen all sorts of horror in her ministry, all sorts of terror, pain and heartbreak. Cloister was no shield if one ventured out from behind the walls to care for Christ's flock, and to leave them to fend for themselves would have been far more horrifying. 

They needed help. Comfort, at least. She could help. So she helped. 

Sometimes, nightmares were the price of that help.  

These dreams, however, had been different from her usual night terrors and garden-variety nightmares. Even before the beacon from the rest of the galaxy had arrived. Even before the Dauntless had departed. She had been sleeping well enough, by her old standards, but her mind had been troubled, the rumblings of great change coming... and in her heart of hearts, she’d known, somehow, that she would have a mission to fulfill, and that she'd know it when the time came. 

In a little village in France, a chance stop for use of the bathroom that had turned into an excuse for coffee and tea in a lovely café as the sun warmed them all, Sister Catherine had gotten the urge to take a walk. She’d walked towards the village church, visible from the café from the moment she’d arrived, more quickly than she'd moved in years, as if she was being pulled by something. The church had been old, beautiful in its way, testimony to centuries long past. 

As she'd walked the old stones, and then behind the altar to admire the delicate stained glass in the windows, she’d found that a stone had come loose, and there had waited for her... the sword. Something had told her it was the Sword of Saint Catherine, perhaps now better known as the sword of Joan of Arc. 

Something? The Holy Spirit, surely.

It was a plain blade with five crosses marked upon it. Worn with use, covered in dust and some light coating of rust that all seemed to fall away as Catherine pulled it from her hiding place with shaking, withered hands. She’d cradled it and crossed herself. 

""The sword of Saint Catherine."" She knew it in her heart. Knew it in her bones. Knew it to the core of her very being. She had not taken a new name on taking Holy Orders. She had been named by her parents for Saint Catherine de Fierbois, patron saint of soldiers, whose church had once held this sword that was destined for the hand of another soldier saint. 

Jeanne d'Arc in her native French, and Joan of Arc in English. The Maid of Orleans. A simple, ordinary peasant girl who had heard the Call, and saved a nation in nomine Dei. Arguably, she’d made a nation, with the great saint helping call forth what would eventually solidify as a French national identity beyond the feuds of squabbling nobles... after she was martyred. 

Catherine had gently touched the blade and found its edge dull... just as it had said in the testimonies and legends of the Saint that had been this blade's last mistress. When a smith had offered to sharpen it, Joan had denied the service, saying that it was not necessary, as she should never kill anybody, and should carry it only as a symbol of authority.

Catherine had set the sword aside and reached into the hidden chamber again, and drawn out a simple leather sheath, worn with age like the sword it had been made for, but still supple; it clearly having been oiled one last time before before it had been left to lay in wait, hidden away from the grasping hands of the English who most assuredly would have wanted the ancient weapon for themselves. 

There, on her knees, she had received her mission. She was to volunteer to go to the stars. She was to take the sword. There amongst the stars, the weapon's destiny would be revealed. 

Her mind flashes past the remembered feeling of her hands shaking as she’d sheathed the blade and lovingly wrapped it in a cloth before slipping it into her luggage. She’d known where she needed to go. Where the sword had to be presented to accomplish her task. To fulfill her faith. 

Luckily for her - or, perhaps, providence had provided - the Vatican was on their itinerary. 

They had balked at first when she had brought the sword and the word to them. Until word reached His Holiness. 

Sister Catherine had not been the only one having interesting dreams of the stars as of late. 

So she had been accepted for one final mission. One final service in her long years of life. 

The challenges had been significant. She’d needed to accomplish certain tasks in so short a time, six months, even as an old woman. Learning Galactic Trade for one, learning to shoot a gun - something she had vaguely remembered lessons from her childhood to fall back on reliably - and learning a variety of emergency systems, galactic customs and history and God only knows what all else! Along with many long hours of theological instruction, prayer, and work with the newly appointed Cardinal and Arch Bishop who would be leading the church outside of Cruel Space. 

His Holiness had likely paid an exorbitant amount of money for the Catholic delegation's one-way trip to the stars, for priests, sisters and brothers - and, of course, some fine young men of the Swiss Guard, God love them. More eager soldiers of Christ could not be asked for, and their enthusiasm had always roused Catherine's spirits. 

The changes that had come with leaving Earth had been... challenging. Some of them, anyway. 

Some had been rather funny, actually. Something to laugh about with the other sisters. She might be relieved of her vow of chastity by papal bull, but she was an old woman, with only enough life and spirit left in her to complete her sacred task. That was something for the younger sisters to fuss over, and fuss they did, to their senior's quiet amusement. 

As they’d prepared, however, as she’d come to understand the true scope of the galaxy, Catherine had become more and more convinced of one fact. That whatever the amount of treasure had been paid out of the papal coffers, it was worth it with a galaxy of uncountable souls to bring the Holy Word to.

It had seemed to her, even then, that others agreed on that point. While other denominations, faiths and indeed even nations were in the middle of schisms, rebellions, and nigh-apocalyptic shake ups - even some talk of war - the Pope had used this opportunity to make peace, establishing tighter ties with the Orthodox church, to heal the schism that had divided the church in times long past. There was still more work to be done than Sister Catherine could begin to process, but scholarship moving towards understanding had seemed to be the rule of the day. The Pope’s domain had been a truly peaceful island of calm and goodwill in an ocean of turmoil. 

To a degree, however, such matters were beyond the men and women selected to carry the cross to the wider galaxy. From her perspective, the great consequence had been that several men of the Orthodox church would be joining them, and the cardinal would be recognized as the patriarch of whatever world he eventually selected for the first church off of Earth. 

Together, they would present a united front to the Galaxy. One, Holy, Catholic, and Apostolic Church. Hallelujah. 

She could see the day they'd gone to set off to the Inevitable as clear as yesterday. A ceremony the likes of which had never been before and likely never would be again had taken place in Saint Peter's Basilica. Each member had been blessed by the Pope and a selection of senior cardinals, and a small delegation of the most senior orthodox patriarchs. All of the patriarchs were there, however. All of them. Not since perhaps the Council of Nicea has Mother Church seen so many passionate shepherds of God’s flock in one place, and Catherine had been forever thankful she'd seen it. 

She can say now, with confidence, that she will still be grateful through the end of her life.

After the ceremony, they'd walked out in procession, escorted by uniformed Swiss Guard, watched over by His Holiness and the Patriarchs of Constantinople and Jerusalem from the Papal balcony. Following after the Cross. Incense thick in the air... to the most people Sister Catherine had ever seen in one place. She’d known in her mind that only three hundred thousand or so could fit into the Piazza San Pietro, but it had felt like millions watching them go... cheering them as if they themselves were going with them to the stars. 

Until, one woman's voice had lifted... and one by one, by hundreds and by thousands, voices had joined that one angelic singer in prayer. Te Deum Laudamus. We Praise You, O God. 

Catherine had wept then. Even as she’d kept walking forward, out of the square and onto the waiting bus. That one beautiful moment had stayed with her ever since, and is with her still. It had kept her strong during the boost to orbit, despite the G forces weighing heavily upon her. It had echoed in the back of her mind as the Inevitable had broken Earth orbit, and she’d bid farewell to her home world for a final time. Even as she’d quietly sung 'On Eagle's Wings' with other English-speaking sisters, she could still hear Te Deum Laudamus. 

The great hymn's echoes had lifted her spirit during the idleness of the trip out of Cruel Space. Luckily, zero g had been surprisingly gentle on her old bones, but the madness of it all, only slightly alleviated by some of the technologies the Dauntless had sent, had been a trial of faith unlike any other in her life. 

Then she’d heard Te Deum Laudamus again when she’d set foot on Centris, set foot on another world for the first time. 

It would not be the last. 

Whether the Church established its offices on Centris or not, and she believed the Cardinal was leaning firmly towards 'not', there’d been paperwork to be done for all of them. Doubtless there is still. With the Undaunted and with the Galactic government. 

Still. Even as their leaders had been busy, both with the council and engaging with identified potential allies among the galactic religions, there’d been plenty of opportunity for her to do her work as well, and bring the Word in a far more personable and individual way. 

On a world like Centris, so alienated from natural life and the natural order of things. Made so cynical by the many thousands of conspiracies around every corner. It had seemed to Catherine that it was a world direly in need of God. In need of faith. In need of the message that life could be so much more. 

Many, of course, had rejected the Word. That was their choice. Some had insulted her and the good people she was working alongside, saying that even if they converted a few thousand souls it wouldn't make a difference. That their efforts were pointless. 

She remembers the shock on the woman's face when she'd told her that everything would be worth it if they converted only one. Because making a difference in the life of one person was enough. 

That particular woman had come back a few times after that, and Catherine had later heard she had requested to be baptized. 

Faith, and the spirit, moves in mysterious ways. 

She remembers the accident. 

The accident!

She lurches slightly as she remembers being hit by an out of control machine and knocked to the sidewalk on her way back to her quarters aboard the Dauntless. She remembered the shock. The pain. So... is she dead, then? Part of her accepts it, though she regrets that she won't be able to help that young woman further along the path. Won't be able to leave Centris with Father Jameson. Won't be able to complete her mission. 

The mission! 

Her eyes open suddenly as a beeping noise plays loudly from some infernal machine strapped to her head; she gingerly removes it as she sits up. 

She'd sat up! 

That’s odd. Normally she feels at least a few aches and pains when she sits up. 

She looks over and finds a mirror and gently touches her face as a nurse, a very non-Human nurse, bustles into her room and begins to check her vitals, waving some doodad or another at her. 

Whatever she’s saying, Catherine can't seem to hear; all her awareness is reduced to what she sees in that mirror as she reaches up and touches her own face. Eyes once dulled by age now clear as crystal, skin wrinkled and weathered by time restored to a perfect rosy-cheeked youth. She’s young again, and beautiful again, in ways she barely recognizes! 

She had read reports, heard rumors, about the strange medicines out here away from ‘Cruel Space’. But never, never had she thought that she would experience their transformative effects.

Her hands reach unconsciously for the sword of St. Catherine, though the holy relic safely had been tucked away in a special vault inside her quarters while she’d tried to learn Axiom techniques to better carry it on her person without carrying the relic publicly.  

It doesn’t matter. She knows it’s safe. She knows now that she walks in a time of miracles, and that she and the sword have great works ahead of them.

She would be able to accomplish her mission. She has another chance. Another life. To fully explore God's wonders in the wider galaxy. 

As the nurse continues to talk, a single tear rolls down Catherine’s face as she finds herself eagerly looking forward to their trip out to the ship her group would be joining, this Crimson Tear. 

It’s the dawn of a new day. 

Gloria in excelsis Deo.

My mom is a severe shopaholic. When my dad was alive, this was manageable but after he passed away 2 years ago, things spiraled out of control - which is why I’ve been taking my mom’s entire pension (and leaving her with only €50/week pocket money for coffee, etc). Before anyone jumps on that: I don’t pocket it. Ipay all of her utilities, rent, phone, internet, and any other bills. I take her grocery shopping twice a week, pay for dinners out, household items, prescriptions, etc. I also cover vacations. Last year alone she went on a cruise with her friends, a spa weekend out of town on her own, and joined me and my son on our Christmas trip. When I actually sat down and did the math, I realized that I spend at minimum 30% more on her than the amount of pension I take from her. I cover the difference out of my pocket. Which I’m fine with as I can afford to top up 30%. 

This arrangement exists because we’ve tried it the other way. In the past, when she insisted on managing her own money, she spent her entire pension ON DAY ONE. Then she couldn’t pay bills, had no money for food, and I had to step in anyway because I obviously can’t leave my mother without light or starving. That always ends with me scrambling to cover everything, which leaves me and my son completely skint - I can cover 30%, but not 130%! 

Keep in mind this arrangement was with her consent as she realized it’s for the best but recently, she’s insisting again that I stop “taking her money.” She’s also complaining to everyone who will listen that I control her finances and treat her like a child. Now basically my entire neighbourhood thinks I’m an abusive AH. 

I’ve tried to compromise. I even offered for her to move in with me so we could save costs, then she could have some more pocket money, She refused, saying whilst she loves my son, she can’t handle him for long periods of time because of his behavior, which she feels is too much for a woman her age. I‘ve also suggested therapy but that’s never going to happen, she is an old school lady from a conservative Central European country and theraphy is unfortunately still not part of the culture here). 

Initially I thought I was 100% right in this situation and didn’t pay much attention to gossip and people who don’t know the full story. Until yesrerday when my uncle (her brother) told me I’m crossing a boundry and I should just “suck it up”, let her have her own money but also cover all of her expenses because “this is what good daughters do” and this is what his kids do too, and he never has to spend any money.

Thank you for taking the time to glance through this post! You're awesome and I hope the rest of your day is just a rad. 

Little about me: I turned 28 last month and have spent the last...oh, year and a half seriously working on myself and my understanding/perspective of the world. I'm a licensed veterinary technician (or nurse if you live overseas) and I'm absolutely in love with my career and ability to help animals. I am going to nursing school currently, but I'm still very torn about that decision as it's pulling me from my passion. 

In my free time, I'm usually found curled up on the couch with my dog and a book. Last year, my public library record says I checked out 576 books. So, I like to read and I read a lot. If it's sunny outside and not -20 or colder, I'm hiking around with my dog or being a menace to local coffee joints, antique stores, and pop up fairs. I LOVE animal behavior and spend a good amount of time with my personal dog training and working on behavior modification. 

Currently, I'm the proud caretaker of 1 doggo, 3 feline furies, and 1 miniature dragon (it's a blue tongue skink. He hates my guts). I also have....like 50+ houseplants?? Taking care of things, watching them grow, change, either by withering or having new growth has always been incredibly soothing to me. I also wrote poetry and *sometimes* perform spoken word poetry even though I have tremendous stage fright. 

I also love cooking. I'm fully emersed in my Korean/Asia cooking era and I've pretty much perfected my ramen noodle/broth recipe. I'm also pretty proud of my Bibimbap and Budae Jjigae (which I can't pronounce and was recently told is also called Army Stew? Either way, it's delicious). I'm a prolific baker and all of my neighbors have gained 10lb since I moved in. I chronically cook wayyyyy too much food and  distribute the leftovers like some sort of stir fry fairy to anyone in my neighborhood who makes eye contact with me. Several people know I meal prep on Sundays and arrive at my house with Tupperware prewashed and ready.

What I'm seeking: I'd love a best friend or at least someone who is interested in talking for longer than a few months. I've found several fantastic people through this subreddit and I've unfortunately lost contact with several of them after losing access to my main social media/texting apps. I'm awake at all hours of the day/night, I love the *fuck* out of getting walls of text messages or even rapid fire spam messages. I'm a HUGE talker/chatter and have sat in coffee shops from open to close just talking with people. Conversation topics are be broad, niche, whatever floats the boat because I'm thrilled to learn something *new* and hear different perspectives. I have a wickedly dark sense of humor (so I'm told), sarcasm is frequently my first and only defense, and I'm prone to hyper focus rants about ridiculous topics (like the theory that the Lost Boys in Peter Pan never age because Peter kills them when they go through puberty. And the pirates? Those are the Lost Boys who escaped and that's why they hate him so much).

If you have any questions or are interested in saying howdy and seeing where it goes, send me message! I'm happy to hear from you and I hope you have a awesome day. ",4,1770408593.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,6,1.0,False

There’s a girl who’s my boyfriend’s friend’s girlfriend. We initially connected because we’re both Hispanic and dating Asian men, so I thought we were becoming friends. Over time, though, I started feeling like she might be a bit cliquey, and I’m not sure if I’m reading too much into it.

When we all went on a trip together, she spent most of her time with her close friend I didn’t expect us to be attached at the hip, but I did feel a little left out at times. I brushed it off, but it still stuck with me.

She was kind enough to talk to me and let me know what’s up with that friend group. 

Another time, at our boyfriends’ friend’s going-away party, we were talking one-on-one and things felt fine. When her friends arrived, I said hello and talked to other people. I noticed they all moved to another area together. I’m pretty sure it social anxiety right? 

Later, I found out that I may have unintentionally offended her during the trip. Apparently, she told my boyfriend’s friend (her boyfriend) that I said something rude like, “Are you really going to finish that?” I completely understand how that sounds out of context.

What I remember is this: the first day, the girls went to a few coffee shops while the guys went to play a sport. At one café, the place was cute but the food wasn’t great. I threw mine away and casually asked if she was going to keep hers. She said yes, and I said something like, “Isn’t it kind of nasty though?” She said she doesn’t like wasting food, and the conversation naturally ended. No argument, no obvious tension at the time.

Now I’m wondering if that comment stuck with her more than I realized, or if she already didn’t vibe with me and that moment just confirmed it for her. I think she’s super nice on her own but I don’t want to force a friendship, but it feels a little uncomfortable since our boyfriends are close friends.

Am I overthinking normal group dynamics, or does this sound like someone who just doesn’t want to be friends? Would you address it directly, keep things polite, or just let it be?",2,1770408502.0,TwoHotTakes,4,1.0,False

1qxsaw2,https://budgetmovingservices.net/moving-blog,The Ultimate Moving Day Checklist: Don’t Leave Without This,"*Moving day is pure chaos, but a little organization goes a long way. Use this checklist to ensure when transitioning and r/RelocatingTo your new home it is as smooth as possible.*

**~~\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_~~**

# 🏠 1. The ""Essentials Box""

# (Keep this in your car, and DO NOT put this in the truck!)

*This is the most important box you’ll pack. It should contain everything you need for the first 24 hours so you aren’t digging through 50 boxes for a toothbrush.*

 \* \[ \] **Toiletries**: Toilet paper (pack 2 rolls!), soap, toothbrushes, and towels.

 \* \[ \] **Bedding**: Sheets and pillows for the first night.

 \* \[ \] **Basic Tools**: A box cutter, screwdriver, and a roll of packing tape.

 \* \[ \] **Chargers**: Phone, laptop, and tablet cords.

 \* \[ \] **Paperwork**: Physical copies of your lease/closing docs and moving company contract.

 \* \[ \] **Medication**: A 3-day supply of any daily meds.

# 🧹 2. The Final Walkthrough

#  (Make sure that nothing accidentally got left behind)

*Before you hand over the keys, do one last sweep.*

 \* \[ \] **Open every drawer and cabinet**: Check the ""hidden"" spots like the dishwasher, microwave, and the top shelf of the closet.

 \* \[ \] **Take ""Condition Photos"":** Photograph every room once empty to prove you left it in good condition (crucial for getting your security deposit back!).

 \* \[ \] **Check the thermostat:** Set it to a ""vacant"" temperature (usually 60°F or 78°F).

 \* \[ \] **Lock up:** Check all windows and back doors.

 \* \[ \] **Trash**: Ensure all garbage is in the bin or taken to the dump.

# 🚛 3. Managing the Movers

 \* \[ \] **Inventory Check**: If using pros, check their inventory list against your boxes.

 \* \[ \] **The ""Fragile"" Talk**: Point out high-value or fragile items specifically.

 \* \[ \] **Water and Snacks**: Keeping your movers hydrated and fed (or at least offering) goes a long way in how they handle your stuff!

 \* \[ \] **Payment/Tip**: Have cash on hand for tips or your card ready for the final balance.

# 🔑 4. Arriving at the New Place

 \* \[ \] **Safety First**: Change the toilet seats (trust us) and consider changing the locks or codes immediately.

 \* \[ \] **Utilities Check**: Make sure the water, lights, and (most importantly) the internet are working.

 \* \[ \] **The ""Dirty"" Clean**: Even if it looks clean, give the inside of kitchen cabinets and the fridge a quick wipe before putting food/dishes away.

 \* \[ \] **Locate the Main Shut-offs**: Know where the water main and the electrical breaker box are before you need them.

# 💡 Pro-Tip:

**The ""Box 1"" Strategy**: Label your boxes by room, but also number them. Box #1 for every room should be the items you need immediately (e.g., Kitchen Box #1 has the coffee maker; Bedroom Box #1 has the pillows).

# 📣 Community Discussion:

For context, I'm a full-time writer who moved here August 6th from Texas for a change of pace. I sold my car, live downtown, and didn't know a single person when I arrived. This sub helped me with with my move, so I thought I'd share an update. Would love to hear from locals and newbies, too; happy to answer any questions - love you all! 

\--

Six months ago, I packed up my life and moved to Buffalo with a mix of intuition, curiosity, and a quiet voice inside me saying, *you need to do this*. I didn’t know exactly what I would find here — only that I needed something different.  
  
And now, half a year in, I can say this: I still love living in Buffalo.  
  
There’s still so much I haven’t seen or experienced yet, and I’m trying to give myself grace about that. I don’t need to do everything all at once. Part of this chapter is letting life unfold slowly — one coffee shop, one snowy walk, one familiar face at a time.  
  
Some things that once felt intimidating now feel completely normal. Taking the bus and train used to require a little extra mental energy — not because it was difficult, but because it was new. Now, I plan my trips without thinking twice. I know my routes. I know my stops. I trust myself to get where I need to go.  
  
But something I didn’t anticipate was how strange it would feel to have so much free time. In Austin, I had a part-time job (in addition to my full-time job) and felt tethered to a schedule. Here, sometimes I wake up and think… I can do *anything* today. And while that freedom is incredible, it can also be disorienting. Learning to live in open space — and not rush to fill it — has been an adjustment in itself.  
  
I won’t pretend it’s all been easy. There was a moment, during one of Buffalo’s many snowfalls, when I questioned everything. The snow was relentless, and for a brief moment, I wondered if I had made a huge mistake.  
  
But that feeling passed quickly. My Reiki healer reminded me that I moved here for a reason — that I followed my intuition, and that intuition hasn’t led me astray. That reminder grounded me in a simple truth: difficult days don’t erase meaningful choices.  
  
And honestly, daily life here feels expansive in a way I didn’t experience before. In Austin, I rarely ventured out — either because of cost or the stress of traffic and parking. Here, I walk or take transit to buy myself a coffee, visit a bookstore, or grab a meal. I do things alone more than ever, and instead of feeling lonely, I often feel capable and curious.  
  
Every day looks different. And I love that.  
  
I haven’t built deep friendships yet, but I’ve met so many kind people. I recognize faces now — bartenders, deli workers, regulars at my weekly spots. There’s something incredibly comforting about walking into a place and hearing someone say hi. I have a regular bar where I go at least once a week, and while I might not be proud of the amount of beer I’ve consumed since moving here, I am proud of the fact that I have somewhere I can show up, let my guard down, and feel a little bit known.  
  
There’s also a deli near me that I visit every week. The food is incredible, and the women behind the counter are genuinely warm. I’ve walked through more than one snowstorm just to get a sandwich from them — which feels like a perfect metaphor for Buffalo life: the weather might be wild, but the rewards are worth it.  
  
Winter, as expected, started to hit differently around January. I think that’s when the novelty wears off for most people. There’s still a lot of winter left, but I’ve learned to focus on the sunny days and make sure I get outside daily. Every day is one step closer to spring — and in the meantime, I’m learning resilience I didn’t know I had.  
  
I’ve also learned something bigger about myself: I’m brave. I can do hard things. Moving didn’t magically solve every problem in my life — but it did change the problems that were rooted in my environment. Being able to leave my apartment, meet people, and experience new things has opened my mind in ways I didn’t expect. I’m starting to imagine possibilities for my future that once felt completely out of reach.  
  
There have been sobering moments, too. One night, I came frighteningly close to being robbed while leaving a bar. I walked away safely, and I’m deeply grateful for that — but it reminded me to stay vigilant even when I generally feel safe. Growth includes learning how to navigate a new city with both openness and awareness.  
  
Creatively, I’ll admit my writing habits have taken a hit. I feel more excited to live life than sit at home writing about it — which is both wonderful and a little ironic. But I trust that my writing rhythm will come back, shaped by all the experiences I’m having now.  
  
Some of my favorite Buffalo moments have come through music. Shortly after my 90-day update, I went to a show at the historic Town Ballroom and absolutely lost my mind over how incredible the venue was. Three months later, I still think about it. More recently, I went to a show at Electric City — another fantastic space — and both are within walking distance from my apartment. That still feels surreal.  
  
So what do I want for the next six months? Fun. Pure fun.  
  
I want to meet people. I want to laugh. I want to keep saying yes to experiences that make me feel alive and connected to this place and to myself.  
  
Six months in, Buffalo doesn’t feel like an experiment anymore. It feels like real life — messy, exciting, challenging, and full of possibility. And for now, that feels exactly right.",31,1770408186.0,Buffalo,22,0.86,False

As we navigate self-improvement and healing, we often hit a phase I call the 'Undefined Void.' This happens when you’ve shed an old identity, left a toxic situation, or just realized that everything you thought was *you* was actually a product of external expectations.

Suddenly, everything is undefined: your boundaries, your goals, your passions, even your basic schedule. This ambiguity feels safe because it means you can't fail, but it's also paralyzing. How do you build a purposeful life when the foundation (you) is still a question mark?

**The Trap of the Grand Definition:** We often wait until we can define our entire purpose ('I will be a globally-conscious entrepreneur who meditates daily!'). But that overwhelming scope keeps us stuck.

**The Power of the Micro-Definition:** Footing is found not in defining the destination, but in defining the very next centimeter of solid ground. This definition doesn't have to be aspirational; it just has to be *clear*.

It could be a micro-boundary: 'I am someone who does not accept calls from X after 7 PM.'

It could be a micro-choice: 'I am someone who chooses silence over background noise in the morning.'

It could be a micro-identity: 'I am someone who makes their own coffee.'

These small stakes in the ground create friction, give you something solid to push off from, and start clarifying the *shape* of the new you.

**My Question for You:** If you've been through that undefined, floating stage, what was the very first, smallest boundary or definition you set for yourself that finally felt like you took your power back?

How can i repeat it?,"Hi so im in the second month of trying to get a damn good shot out of the robot. Countless beans and always ended with thin, bitter kinda meh coffee. I dont have access to fresh beans for now but today i just made a clrazg espresso and just want to figure out how the heck did i do that lol.

Basically what i did is try 20g of beans, used the sprout which i preheated. Made two cups, did not add too much coffee to them. Proabily like 20g each max. I prepped the puck with wdt and a hard press. I initially did a preinfusion for a couple seconds then ramped up and down between 6 and 4 bars. I think the fact i pressed it too hard made it a bit tiring to push further bars. My hands got tired but im not sure if most of it was 4 or 6 bars.

Anyway, the result, an amazing italian style i suppose crema espresso, nice and suroupy, a bit on the sweet side(which i love).

Now i need to figure out how the heck did i managed to do that because it was crazy.

I rarely did 20g in, could that be the reason? Plus the fact that i dis not fully extract the coffee. Or it was becuase i stayed mostly between 4 and 6 bars?

I mot sure, i know its a silly question but dang that espresso was good. Mind you im using 1 year old illy beans.

If the reason for it is the fact that i added 20g, how do i manage to do the same in times when i just need a single shot tho? Most of the times i drink solo and no more than 25g of espresso (coffee, not beans).

The purpose of my last brief lean bulk was to make some gains on Chest and I really feel like it paid off now. Visibly fuller chest. 

I lowered my Incline press weight, and fly weight during the bulk to really lock in on form, also lowered the volume but added intensity and now take a rest day every 4th day instead of the 6 on 1 off I had been doing. Chest exercises are Incline Press, Cable Fly, Crossovers, and weighted Dips.

Cut calories are 2100, my diet is very simple and lacks variety but I absolutely love it and love the easy prep. Each day, spread out over 5 meals, I eat in total 4 servings of 96% lean beef, 3 servings of rolled oats, 2 servings of walnuts, 2 bananas, 1 avacado, 4 servings of broccoli and 2 pints of protein ice cream that contain no sugars, added collagen, and almond milk. 2 black coffees, and 8-12 16oz bottles of water. 

Supplements are creatine 10g Ed, TRT @200mg E7D, multi vitamin, magnesium.

Goal is to push bf% to around 7-8% for a short time to clear out some stubborn fat stores from my lower ass and continue to thin out the abdominal fat stores and see if the loose skin (from being 270lb at one point) will firm up a bit. We'll see.

1qxs32a,https://www.reddit.com/r/sterilization/comments/1qxs32a/one_week_out/,One week out!,"As of today I had my surgery one week ago and I’m feeling great :) I must have read every experience post on here in prep for mine so it’s time for me to pay my dues hahaha

I had a very smooth consultation and scheduling process thanks to my amazing gynecologist (Dr. Alyssa Erb in NYC!) and my surgery was pretty normal as well—nothing different from the other stories that have been told a million times on here so I won’t waste your time, lol. I’m lucky to be the kind of freak who actually feels more relaxed in hospitals and around doctors, so I cruised through my surgery day with no complaints other than how hungry I was.

I have a ton of piercings I had to remove as no metal is allowed in the body, so I just left my healed ones empty and put plastic retainers in the newer ones in my ears and glass in my nipples. I was told either material is fine but some hospitals don’t allow glass, definitely check with your doctor. Btw I was so scared the glass retainers would break in my nipples but it was completely fine, I slept in them and everything lol. Also—a bit silly but I was worried about my permanent retainer on the back of my teeth (metal!) and was assured that it was completely fine, but the anesthesiologist appreciated me letting him know for the intubation process. I spent a small fortune on Invisalign last year so I’m glad they were careful with my teeth!!

My friend came to pick me up and I was actually feeling well enough to take the subway home, and we picked up my oxy prescription and some snacks at cvs before crashing at my apartment for the rest of the day. A lot of people say they had no appetite but personally I was STARVING after my surgery and ate a huge order of penne alla vodka like a wild animal as soon as I got home lol. I felt like my stomach was a bottomless pit for about 3 days after my surgery, I assume because my body needed tons of calories to heal.

Pain was minimal, I had crazy shoulder/collarbone pain from the gas but the walk home from the subway helped, I also took a gas x. I’ve heard that it only helps with gas in the intestines but the shoulder pain went away for good shortly after, idk if that’s placebo but if it works it works lol. I managed with just regular ibuprofen for the first 4 days and then I’ve honestly been good on pain meds! The absolute worst pain I had was from the catheter. My pro tip is to spray water down there while you’re peeing—I had a squeeze bottle the hospital gave me when I’d had a hymenectomy a few years back that I’d held on to just in case, and it was a life saver. I think they’re called irrigation bottles or something, amazon will def have them! But the catheter pain was gone by the middle of the day after my surgery.

My surgery was on a Friday, so I took the weekend off and literally just laid in bed for 72 hours with breaks to get up to use the bathroom or pace around to keep the blood flowing. I made a point every morning to at least walk a block or two to grab coffee, just so I was moving a bit more and getting a little fresh air. To not jostle my incisions I wore a hoodie and put my hands in the pocket and held my stomach to keep it from moving too much, this way your abdomen has support but no one sees you walking around clutching your stomach haha

By Monday I was back at work! This was not a good thing 😬 I’m a solo barista at a busy cafe and I move and twist and bend a lot and by the Monday night shift I was absolutely not ready for it. I felt like I was moving in slow motion and genuinely almost passed out a few times. I know a lot of people talk about being back up on their feet by the next day but I am not that guy, lol. I was at work 2 days after my previously mentioned hymenectomy so I thought I could do it again, but an abdominal surgery like this is a totally different beast. My absolute biggest fumble with the prep for this procedure was not taking more time off, I was so worried about the money lost from missing shifts but ultimately I really needed probably around 5 days post surgery to recover to the point where I wasn’t worthless at work. If you work a physical job please don’t push yourself, you only have one body!! Two days missing off of your paycheck is nothing compared to the medical bills if you develop a hernia because you went back to work too soon.

I would say by the Wednesday after my procedure I felt “normal” again, as in I could walk briskly, gently bend and twist, and stand up and sit down without any pain at all. I also made it through a shift without thinking I was going to die at some point, lol. This was also the day I was finally able to sleep on my side and stomach again!!! The only residual pain is an occasional feeling of tightness or tingling in my belly button, which I assume is from the stitches and all the layers of skin and fat and muscle trying to heal. I’ve been massaging it gently so hopefully any scar tissue loosens up.

Thursday I felt even better, did some household chores and went to work and felt good the entire time. My glue started to peel a bit on this day—I guess I’m one of those people with unsticky skin lol. I’ve been snipping it with nail clippers when too much has lifted off, all of what’s been peeling is around the incisions so luckily they’re still covered.

And now it’s Friday again! I’m pretty amazed that I feel this good literally a week after having my abdomen cut open, but that’s the miracle of modern medicine lol. I would say yesterday was the first day the joy and relief of having the procedure done actually hit, like I woke up and was like holy shit I’ll never get pregnant thank god 😭 shoutout to everyone on this subreddit posting their experiences and tips, y’all are the best. If you’re reading this pre surgery good luck and if you’re post happy healing!!! Love u all be well 🫶🫶🫶",2,1770407809.0,sterilization,1,1.0,False

Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again. In one Age, called the First Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Jura Mountains. The wind was not the beginning. There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time. But it was a beginning.

6:30am 

Dr. Alex Rommell stared at his clock as it blared, hoping the sound of the alarm would distract him from the growing pit in his stomach. Alright, let’s get this over with. Today’s experiment will go exactly as planned. My lab will get the funding it needs to stay open and my name will forever be immortalized with a Nobel prize. He pulled the covers off of himself, the cold air giving him a slight jolt, and got ready. 

The early morning quiet, usually a welcome presence on Alex’s walk to the Large Hadron Collider, seemed to only make his nerves that much louder today. His mind wandered as he ran through his experiment protocol in his head for the umpteenth time. Suddenly, he found himself walking into this computer lab where he was greeted by Michelle, Robert, and Sam, his three research fellows. 

“Good morning, Alex,” they said almost in unison. 

 

“The collider is all set up and ready to go. Your computer is set up for you at your desk. Let me know when you’re ready to start,” said Michelle. “It’s okay to be nervous…I know a lot is riding on today, but your math is sound. We’ll find what we’re looking for today, I feel it.” 

Alex turned to her and mustered up a small smile. “Thank you, Michelle. Do we have a pot of coffee made?”

“Sorry, boss. We ran out over the weekend. I tried to get more but our lab account is overdrawn,” Sam said across the room.

“If Sam stuck to our one-cup rule, we wouldn’t be in this situation,” jested Robert. Sam threw a paper ball at Robert. 

“Alrighty then. We’re running on empty cups and empty banks today,” muttered Alex. “Well, no point in delaying anymore then. When will proton concentration peak today?”

“Proton peak begins in 15 minutes,” answered Robert.

Alex sat down at his computer as Michelle announced the collider was on. As the collider began to run, the computer began plotting the energy level of each proton collision. Alex and his team theorized that while a collision between two protons released measurable energy, a collision between three or more protons at once could release enough energy to be harnessed. The problem was that getting three protons to collide was a near statistically impossibility. His idea generated quite a bit of buzz and funding at the beginning, but the continued failure of his experiment to be able to actually capture such an event landed him in the money-less predicament he now found himself in.

But today was different. The current solar particle event was peaking today and an abnormally high number of protons were raining down on Earth from the Sun. Today was their best chance to collide three or more protons together and change the future of energy. 

“We have entered proton peak. All detectors are on and running as expected,” said Sam.

Alex focused on the plotted points in front of him. He wasn’t sure what he was looking for in the data yet, but he would know when he saw it. Plot point after plot point landed at the level where they always hit. Alex’s eyes stayed focused on the screen, the rest of the world melting away. His breathing settled into even breaths and his mind was emptied except for the points in front of him. His fellow’s voices faded into the background of his mind as he singled in on the computer in front of him. Even his nerves seemed to dull in the throes of his intense focus. 

And then he saw it. 

The energy level of the last collision jumped. And the next one jumped even higher than that. Alex saw a third point plot even higher. In the corner of his mind’s focus, he became aware of the presence of an energy that was not there before. In this intense focus, it almost felt far away but he couldn’t stop himself reaching out for it. Saidin threatened to overwhelm him. He shot up from his chair gasping, life filling him. He wrestled with this energy, trying to keep himself from being swept away in its torrent but unwilling to let go from the sweetness it brought. He looked at Michelle and could see the sweat beading on her forehead. Robert’s typing suddenly seemed so loud. He could smell Sam’s deodorant from across the room. Everything was brighter and crisper.

“Alex, are you okay?” Michelle asked. She hesitantly took a step toward him. 

Alex felt like he was about to burst. This torrent of sweet, sweet life was starting to tetter on pain and it had to go somewhere. He pushed it forward and out of him in his mind. Just out of the corner of his eyes, he saw threads of red, blue, white, yellow, and green come together in front him. What is happening? I…I can’t stop. The threads formed into a complex configuration in front of him. Blinding white light burst from the weaved pattern and then Alex went dark.  

—--

Alex awoke dazed and confused. He was in a hospital bed, the machines around him beeping softly. He pulled himself up on the bed and let out a deep sigh. Lord he was tired. What happened? He looked down at himself but didn’t find any injuries. He didn’t feel any pain at all. Alex thought back to what he remembered last. The collider was on…he was watching his computer. The energy spikes. They had done it! Oh my god. And then what happened after…The explosion! His fellows! Where are they?

As he was about to press the call button, a suited man walked in. He flashed his badge at Alex. FBI. What was he doing in Switzerland? 

“We’re glad to see you’re awake, Doctor. I”ve been waiting for you to wake up for a week,” said the man who identified himself as Eli. 

“A week? What happened? Where are my fellows?” asked Alex. 

“I’m very sorry, but there was an incident. A week ago, an explosion occurred in your lab and destroyed part of the Haldron collider. You were the only survivor in your lab and you were found completely unscathed,” Eli said somberly. 

A lump appeared in Alex’s throat. Breathing became hard and tears came to the surface. “How did this happen? What’s going on?”

“That’s what we’re hoping you could tell us. There’s more. After the explosion, reports appeared all over the world of people suddenly able to do impossible things. The world has shifted, changed, and we think it started with your lab. Tell me what happened.”",1,1770407685.0,WoTFanfiction,0,1.0,False

Today didn’t arrive with fireworks or big announcements. It just… showed up. Quietly. Like it was saying, “I’m not here to impress you. I’m here to be lived.”

The morning light slipped through the window in a way that felt intentional, even though it wasn’t. Coffee tasted slightly better than usual, probably because no one was rushing me to finish it. I realized how rare that is—how often we gulp moments instead of sipping them.

There was a strange comfort in doing ordinary things today. Answering messages. Staring out the window for no reason. Letting a song play till the end instead of skipping halfway. Nothing productive enough to brag about, yet nothing wasted either.

Some days are milestones. Others are placeholders. And then there are days like this—soft, unremarkable, grounding. The kind that quietly hold your life together without demanding credit.

Going to a brunch with 12 people and the host, who knows I’m a coffee geek, asked me if I could solve coffee for the group. I make pour overs exclusively and don’t even have a batch brewer. My wife doesn’t even drink coffee!  

Based on her friends, I think they would appreciate better cups, but would love some thoughts.  I had a 02 Switch which probably has the highest capacity, but still won’t be very fun to make that much coffee for a big group on my own.

All Payroll stuff seems sketchy here at new work,"Recently I joined a new job, this is first time I am working for a small company.

It is a full time salary role.  noticed my first paycheck was so low, so asked supervisor and she mentioned, she requested partial payment for the first week since I was working until 2 PM instead of 4 PM for the training period. she mentioned about checking with HR to figure out if it also was only covering one week payment or full two weeks since our pay period is bi-weekly and she mentioned she told HR to make sure I am on full pay rate starting week 2 because training period was only for one week and never followed up.

(Weird thing about this too is that only she has access to HR payroll - I have to ask her for paystub instead of going online and check myself which is odd cause even at restaurant job, you would be able to log in and check it yourself

so I was wondering if it is legal to pay only for hours of training that I did for the first week when I am on full salary contract and  especially today some of employees under me came to me saying director promised them certain hourly wage - when they asked for paystub, it was below the wage that was promised and told me that director also told them that she is underpaying me too. ( my salary is clearly written on contract - so I am waiting till next paycheck to see and if it is underpaid, trying to see what my options are. 

It just seems all sketchy also after hearing from employee that they have no idea where the tips for coffee kiosk that is part of our opertation goes to-  many of them asked director, and never heard anything about it back. ",3,1770407125.0,jobs,1,1.0,False

Shiva’s grin at Henry’s reaction gave a playful expression to his ashen face as he turned to look back at the view of the asteroid field.  “Captain, please understand that, as I exist within a linear timeframe, I do not do so in the way you do.  I can undertake several different actions at the same time without incurring any ill effects.  You merely perceive them occurring simultaneously from the same core.”
 
Henry shook his head slowly, and brought the mug up to his face, his eyes looking deep into the dark liquid.  The scent of the rich coffee filled his nose  He glanced back to the navigating two-armed God AI with wide eyes, “This is going to be like the cherry, isn’t it?”
 
Shiva continued to grin a bit as he slowly nodded, “Of course.  The beans are from Kodagu, and produce a  rich drink without too much acid.  Please enjoy it.  And fear not, the temperature will be the perfect one for you to drink it.”  His hands swooped slightly, and the rocks in the hemispherical view moved gracefully, and started to thin out.  
 
Henry muttered quietly, “Of course it will be,” then brought the mug to his lips.  As he sipped the coffee, he was hardly surprised to find that it was better than any other cup he had ever had.  Hints of cocoa and spices he couldn’t quite identify made the espresso-strong coffee something to be lingered over and savored.  He couldn’t help but let out a quiet ‘Mmmm’ of appreciation.
 
And, just as Shiva had said, it was a perfect drinking temperature.
 
When he had finished swallowing, Henry shook his head again, “How?  How can you have these flavors so perfectly?”
 
Shiva’s head turned to look at Henry, “Is it not enough that I am a god?  No… I see that it isn’t for you, Captain Miller.”  He chuckled and looked back to the hemisphere before him, continued to guide the antique bomber to the clear space that was becoming more visible.  “Some of the programmers on my project did their homework.  They made a pilgrimage back to Old Earth, and sampled what they could find so that they could bring the sights, sounds, scents, tastes, and feel of my people’s home to me.  This, each team did for their god.”
 
 
Henry raised an eyebrow and shook his head in disbelief, ""But, The Conservancy...""
 
 
""Captain, please understand that the existential dread that… permeated... Terran society at that time was almost tangible.""  As the view in the hemisphere all but cleared of asteroids of any appreciable size, Shiva let his hands drop from their graceful motions, and turned to face Henry, his eyes taking in the astonished look. ""So, yes, The Conservancy bowed to the will of the military for this effort.""
 
 
Realization slowly blossomed on Henry's face, and he nodded slowly.  ""And that's why they set you up as gods?  And why they built the Hutchinson Device, even though it has never been proven to work... They were *that* desperate.""
 
 
Shiva chuckled quietly and extended an arm toward Henry's shoulder, the gentle pressure of his hand guiding the man toward a different corner of the balcony, where, between the buildings, the lazy flow of the river could be seen wending its way through the city.  ""Yes, they were.”  He sighed before continuing, “They were so desperate that they even created *us* to control battlestations, without thinking about the ramifications..."" 
 
 
Shiva's hand dropped from Henry's shoulder, and he leaned his palms on the stone railing, looking off into the hot, hazy air. ""They only thought about their fears, and not about *Veer Rasa*...""  The ashy grey face going gently into a frown as he spoke.
 
 
Henry managed to enjoy another sip of the luxuriant liquid in his mug, but his expression went quizzical at the God AI's term.  ""I... I'm sorry. Veer what?""
 
 
Shiva's frown lessened and a bitter chuckle escaped his lips.  ""Ah, already we encounter a place where concepts don't translate.  Truly an archetypical conversation for humans and gods.""
 
 
Shiva slowly turned from his hazy view of the empty city, the gaze of his three eyes locking on Henry's.  ""The concept is that of 'Veer Rasa' in the ancient tongue, and there is no direct translation into the common tongue you now use.""
 
""You might find the closest description to be a synthesis of valor, heroism, mastery, pride, and steadfastness.  Some have crudely termed it 'strength and guts',"" Shiva shook his head gently and spread his ashen hands as he continued, ""but that simplicity lacks the aspects of altruism and gallantry of the true warrior who willingly enters the battle they know they cannot win in order to save or prepare the way for others that are not prepared or able to defend themselves. And even this brief sentiment cannot fully capture what it means, though it will have to suffice for now.""
 
 
""You see, your leaders of the time feared for their positions, and the perception of human society by the greater galactic populations, than for honor or valor. Hence, you find poor Enola and I, and now you and your crew, on this despicable fool's errand in the continuance of a conflict that erupted from the drive for justice and fairness; some of the best parts of humanity...""
 
 
Henry realized that his jaw had slowly dropped as he had listened to Shiva's words, and quickly shut his mouth and swallowed, stopping his mouth from letting out the defensive words that instinctively sprang to his tongue.  Slowly, his brain came up with something more useful to the current situation, and he simply got out, ""A fool's errand?""

""I am sorry, Being Vicki, I did not comprehend your last statement.""
 
 
Vicki’s holographic form didn’t look away from the holoscreen of the navigation console where her virtual fingers worked in a flurry over the controls.  “ Sorry, Vraks.  I didn’t realize I gave audible output.”
 
 
The AI’s image faltered for a moment, and the quiet beep of the deflector shield absorbing damage emanated from the weapons console. Vicki’s digital voice came from the air near her holographic form, harsh with its curse, “Decoherent seg-faults!  How is it possible that the Enola Gay is avoiding all those asteroids, and we’re still in the thick of it?”
 
 
Vraks’ insectoid head swiveled to look at the AI’s holographic form, “Avoiding?  That spacecraft is so much larger than this… The Sac.  Shouldn’t it be easier for you?”
 
Vicki continued to grumble as she continued to work on the navigator’s console, the brown outlines of asteroids twisting wildly back and forth as she tried to keep the small green representation of the scout ship from colliding with them.  “Yes.  It should.  But even trying to follow the same path, I just can’t keep up with- Frak!”  Another quiet beep and a distant muffled ‘thump’ accompanied the AI’s expletive.  
 
 
The edges of Vrak’s facial plates began to pale, and its upper manipulators circled nervously, “Being Vicki!  You must slow our passage, as you did with our approach to the warship!”  The words came with more clicking of mandibles and buzzing than the Dravitian’s usual speech.
 
 
The AI’s holographically projected limbs continued to work franticly on the console’s controls as her voice filled the air, its projected focal point of the holographic form forgotten for a moment, “I can’t!  We don’t know the range of the neural link the Captain is wearing!  We *have* to stay close to that ship!”
 
 
 
-=-=-=-=-=-

 
 
 
“Yes, Captain Miller, a fool’s errand.”  Shiva quirked a lopsided grin as he gestured with his left arm out over the quiet, empty city that spread in the hazy air surrounding the palace-temple.  “Your peoples have such strengths in their ingenuity and industry when they find a pressing need.  Even in your early times, you found ways to construct marvels that rivaled natural wonders with only the simplest of tools and materials.”  He paused as his eyes scanned the view for a moment.
 
 
“But in your times of stress, that ingenuity and industry can be used in the production of items of terrible capacity, with consequences that cannot be foreseen by mere mortals.”  He gestured casually, and a second hemisphere appeared in the air, just past the railing of the balcony.  On the curved interior, rather than a view of ‘real space’ outside the bomber, there were wireframe images, schematics, and images from the construction process of the bomber itself.  “One like this, for example…”

I can still remember the sick desperation I had to recoup my gambling losses. id make thousands and lose thousands as soon as I got it. sometimes I would win it back and then some. but every single time following a big win, I would lose it right back PLUS some more of my money. 

I was looking at my banking statements the other day.  there were months where I made 12 grand from my job. only to see that my debits were 12500.  or 13000. I had such a beautiful, sturdy cushion to rest on and yet i would blow it. for years and years this happened. 

so how does one cope with this? lots of alcohol. since I quit gambling my alcohol use has come under control. during my gambling addiction, it spiraled out of control.  I dont know how much of my losses were when i was drunk, but id guess half.  alcohol wasn't the cause though. i can still remember all night blackjack sessions sober. drinking coffee to stay awake. 

gambling was the worst thing that ive ever engaged in. worse than almost anything else. gambling also caused me to commit crimes which caused me to go to prison. I just got off of probation last year March..and I havent gambled one time. 

  its only a matter of time before the house wins. its only a matter of time until you start thinking constantly about the gambling. seeing blackjack hands in your mind without even playing.  I lost the value of money. fuck it , if I can win 1000 dollars in less than 30 seconds, it makes traditional work seem like a fools game. these are lies. the casino knows they will get their money back eventually.

I spoke with a blackjack dealer who said that the most she paid out was 50 grand. but the guy lost it all. she laughed and said ""it doesnt count as winning if you give it right back"". thats the issue. that's how they win. they get it back. maybe not right away. maybe you have some discipline to pay off some bills and think ""look..I just made use of the money in a good way.""  but what really happens is that it goes right back to the casino. in some way, shape or form.  

do yourself the best gift you will ever give yourself.  stop the nonsense. value your money. noone truly can afford throwing money down the drain.  give that money to someone who needs it: to you.  if not to you then to a friend or family member.  start building bridges instead of burning them !!",4,1770407007.0,GamblingRecovery,1,1.0,False

So my tags are expired. Registration expired. Out of state plates. I have been a nervous wreck driving, and I feel so much shame and stress.

I got my license sorted out, but the vehicle registration process is weird in this state- its a separate office instead of just one DMV. I couldn't figure out the steps to get my car registered and have been avoiding it and shame spiraling instead. 

But TODAY. I felt the meds start working and I knew that *today was the day* (don't ask me why I'm just along for the ride). I made three different phone calls and asked questions, had to go get my registration from my car in my bathrobe because of course I forgot to get that first, and got the process started. As a little treat, I found... my tags! Turns out they don't expire until this year. I am still driving legally and I didn't lose them. Of course they have been in my stupid glove box this whole time because WHY WOULD I LOOK THERE?

Anyway, I am going to finish my coffee, put some pants on, and then go put my tags on the car before I get pulled over. I just needed to tell someone about my wins today who will get it. I hope you all get some wins today, big or little! ",2,1770406870.0,adhdwomen,1,1.0,False

1qxrlyn,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxrlyn,Rug in which room?,which space is best for this area rug? im working on my guest bedroom but im also tired of the area rug in my living room. it is too bright and too harsh with the light gray couch. i ordered this rug with the idea of putting it in the guest bedroom and then either switching out the curtains or pillows to tie in the color but now im thinking it might be better in the living room. eventually id like to paint the bedroom and the living room but trying to decide those colors has also been tough. id also like a brown round coffee table in the living room. disregard the side table by the records… that is all going to be redone with a larger cabinet/media console. basically….. i just need help with both of these rooms!! thank you!!,1,1770406738.0,DesignMyRoom,3,1.0,False
1qxrllo,https://www.reddit.com/r/LGBTWeddings/comments/1qxrllo/black_tie_meets_slumber_party/,Black tie meets slumber party,"My fiancee (26F) and I (28F) are getting married in a Scottish castle later this year (we are from the US). We’re expecting about 20 guests (mix of older family members and friends). Dress code is black tie, day will start at 1 with the ceremony, then cocktail hour while we take photos, then four course dinner, then tea/coffee, then entertainment until evening buffet at 9pm. Guests will have the option of spending the night before and the night of in the castle. 

SO - we’re not exactly the dance/disco type of people so we were pondering different evening entertainment options we could do. 

Our thoughts are that people (including us) won’t want to be fancy for ten hours, and may benefit from a costume change. We are always saying that every night together as a couple feels like a sleepover SO we want the second half of the day to be a sleepover. We enjoy card and board games and do that as an activity with friends/family when we’re together. What we’re thinking of doing a sleepover/game night type of vibe. (picture The Princess Diaries)

Tentative plans so far:

- buy all our guests matching pajamas  
- party favors will be decks of cards as a souvenir for coming to an abroad wedding
- bring card games with us 
- some sort of treasure hunt/bingo/kahoot esc something to get the guests interacting with each other (I proposed with an elaborate scavenger hunt so that’s A Thing in our story)
- there’s a room with a pool table so that could be of use too 
- our venue offers a hot chocolate bar and we will absolutely be taking advantage of that. 
- we will have access to a projector/screen so maybe put something on there? Maybe a movie?  Planning on having a slideshow running during the meal


I guess what we wanna know is:
1. Is this a fun idea?

1qxrlid,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1qxrlid/and_so_it_ends_with_a_whisper_and_not_a_bang/,And so it ends with a whisper and not a bang.,"I (46F) am 36 days sober. I started with Dry January and after Dry Jan, I was going to enjoy a drink on Feb 1. Then Feb 1 happened and I was thinking, what if I just did Dry Feb too? Now that we are 6 days in to Feb, today I have made the commitment, I will no longer be drinking.

My story isn't dramatic, I do not have any insane drinking horror stories. I have never embarrassed myself while drinking. I have not ever missed work or lost friends over my drinking. I didn't even start drinking until I was 21. 

What did happen was a slow usage that built up over years and came to a head during COVID when I was drinking everyday.  I realized one day I had this little voice in my head that would just softly say ^""hey, ^wouldn't ^it ^be ^nice ^to ^have ^a ^drink?"" At first, in my 20's and 30's that voice only came at times that were drinking appropriate, like weekends and after work, but it started creeping in during the day, right when I woke up, before meetings, during lunch, and at more very inappropriate times to be drinking. It wasn't an aggressive monster screaming at me like when I quit smoking, it was more like an annoying gnat I would have to swat down multiple times during the day to focus on what I needed to do. Post COVID, I work from home and it became easy to succumb to the voice and easy to start with a coffee and Baileys for a morning perk up and easy to end the day with 3 generous pours of gin. By 2021, I went to sleep every night drunk and I woke up every morning, just slightly hungover but ""functional"".

Between 2021 and now I have quit for periods of time. I quit a month here and there and if you read up on my post history you will see I had cancer in 2023, I quit the 4 months I had to do chemo but started up again right after. You think that would have been my wake up call, but like many here have said before I thought I could control it, that I could be a once a week or special occasion drinker. The problem is the more I drink the more often that little voice shows up and the more often it shows up, its becomes louder and and more persistent. I'd come back from my break and try to commit to weekends only, then it would be weekends plus Thursday then maybe Monday too, then eventually I'd be back to drinking every day.

But very time I have stopped, I notice the voice getting further away and quieter, it taps my shoulder less frequently, sometimes going days in between taps and the volume is much lower, much easier to ignore.

So this is it friends, I am done. I don't want to fight that voice anymore. IWNDWYT or tomorrow and hopefully ever again.",59,1770406707.0,stopdrinking,18,0.99,False

1qxrl2k,https://i.redd.it/dndbmq9tfxhg1.jpeg,[SDUT] Padres spring training primer: Relievers - The Padres had assembled arguably baseball's best bullpen BEFORE acquiring Mason Miller.,"# 2025 recap

Baseball ops chief **A.J. Preller** has made a habit of using the trade deadline to bolster postseason bullpens, from **Trevor Rosenthal** in 2020 to **Josh Hader** in 2022 to **Tanner Scott** and **Jason Adam** in 2024.

In 2025, the Padres already had three relievers (Adam, **Robert Suarez**, **Adrián Morejón**) named to the All-Star team when Preller stunned baseball by shipping away top prospect **Leo De Vries** to pry right-hander **Mason Miller** away from the Athletics.

The move cemented the Padres’ pen as the best in the game as no other unit accumulated more WAR, as their relievers’ total (7.6) was nearly a win better than the next team. Padres relievers also led the majors in ERA (3.06), strand rate (77.3%) and opponent average (.206)

Individually, Suarez (2.97 ERA) led the NL with 40 saves, Morejón (2.08 ERA) led all relievers with 13 wins and Adam (1.93 ERA) was tied for second in the majors with 29 holds heading into September. Adding Miller into the mix enabled the Padres to shorten games even more in front of a compromised rotation and he was even better after the trade to San Diego, striking out 45 over 23⅓ innings (0.77 ERA) and throwing an immaculate inning while mostly working as a set-up man ahead of Suarez.

depth to survive the injury as **Jeremiah Estrada** (3.45 ERA) finished tied for fifth with 30 holds and fourth in appearances (70), **David Morgan** (2.66 ERA) impressed in his rookie season and **Wandy Peralta** (3.14 ERA) rebounded in his second season in San Diego.

Come playoff time, the Padres’ bullpen allowed two runs in 13⅔ innings (1.32 ERA), with Miller striking out eight over 2⅔ hitless innings across two games and Morejón throwing 4 ⅓ scoreless innings across three games.

# Current picture

With Suarez leaving as a free agent to work as a set-up man in Atlanta, Miller will slide into the ninth inning. The team has four more years of control of Miller, so a move back to the rotation was considered this offseason before both parties decided to keep their most electric pitching asset pitching in the role that’s allowed him to be healthy and dominant the last two years.

A free agent after the season, Morejón will also remain in the bullpen, where he has found a home after years of shuffling between the majors, the minors and the injured list.

Adam is trending toward a healthy start to spring training, which means the team could open the season with its preferred victory formation — Miller, Adam, Morejón, Estrada, no matter the order — already in place.

Beyond those four, lefties Peralta and **Yuki Matsui** (3.98 ERA) will be asked to get important outs in middle relief, Morgan figures to get a chance to earn more trust and rookie **Bradgley Rodriguez** (1.17 ERA) should get a chance to build on impressive first cup of coffee.

Four relievers — Miller (United States), Peralta (Dominican Republic), **Alek Jacob** (Italy) and **Ron Marinaccio** (Italy) — will miss time in camp for the World Baseball Classic. Their absence could allow the Padres to get a longer look at depth options in camp, from newcomers **Daison Acosta** and **Ty Adcock**, to **Bryan Hoeing** off an injury-marred 2025 to **Kyle Hart** as a starter/long reliever to minor league**r Garrett Hawkins** in his first big-league camp to non-roster invitees like left-handers **Omar Cruz** and **Ryan Och** and right-handers **Manuel Castro**, **Logan Gillaspie** and **Francis Peña**.

# On the farm

Elite relievers often begin their pro careers as starting pitchers (see Miller and Morejón), but the Padres a good track record of bringing along relief prospects.

Morgan made the jump last year and Rodriguez, 22, has been on the fast track since starting 2024 at low Single-A Fort Wayne.

Up next: The 25-year-old Hawkins, who returned from Tommy John surgery to strike out 85 over 60 innings (1.50 ERA) in rising from high Single-A Fort Wayne to Double-A San Antonio and onto the 40-man roster for the first time this fall.

The Padres’ farm system ranks 29th out of 30, according to Baseball America, primarily because all of Preller’s trades have forced a number of short-burst relievers into the organization’s top-30: Rodriguez (9), right-hander **Tucker Musgrove** (12), Hawkins (23) and Peña (27).

Peña took a step back last year at Triple-A El Paso (4.99 ERA), but Musgrove emerged as an intriguing prospect in the Arizona Fall League, where he was touching 99 mph with 6 feet, 9 inches of extension.

I assume that he’s read that yoga classes are a good place to meet women and being newly divorced he still thinks women should be throwing themselves at him.

Met up with a friend for coffee last week.  My friend was running late so a middle aged man decided I would welcome him invading my space and sat down to talk to me.  My friend turned up so we left and went elsewhere.

1qxri95,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortscarystories/comments/1qxri95/the_day_i_forgot_the_color_blue/,The Day I Forgot the Color Blue,"It started last Wednesday when I looked at the sky. You know how it’s just… there? Well, for me, it wasn’t. Or rather, it was, but I suddenly couldn't remember what color it was supposed to be.

My mind knew the word ""blue."" I could say it. I could spell it. But I couldn't conjure the image. It was as if a file in my brain had been corrupted. I looked at the ocean, at my jeans, at a sapphire ring, and felt a hollow, ringing silence in my head. It was like forgetting the face of someone you love while they are standing right in front of you.

The Missing Birds

The next day, the birds vanished. Not that they flew away—I simply realized I had never actually seen one. I could describe them, I knew the word ""wing"" and ""song,"" but my memory held no visual record of them ever existing. Their absence was so absolute that I began to doubt they were ever real to begin with.

My coworkers laughed when I asked, ""What exactly is a bird?"" They thought I was joking. But their laughter sounded like breaking glass, and their faces... their faces began to drift.

Unfixed Features

Now, when I look at people, their faces are no longer stable. My friend John—I can see his nose, but his eyes belong to someone else. His mouth is the mouth of a stranger I saw at the bus stop. His features are constantly migrating, like puzzle pieces that refuse to lock into place. I can talk to ""John,"" but I’m never sure I’m seeing him. I’m only seeing a collage.

Last night, I realized why.

I was sitting on the sofa, looking at my hands. They were mine. I was sure of it. But when I tried to lace my fingers together, they didn't quite line up. They moved a fraction of a second too late, as if they were being operated by a remote signal with high latency.

Then, I looked at my reflection in the window.

The Mosaic

My face wasn't mine. It was assembled. My eyes belonged to a woman I’d seen in a grocery line three years ago. My chin was a replica of a man’s from a photograph. My forehead was a blank space filled with the texture of a concrete wall.

I understood then. I didn't forget the color blue. I didn't forget the birds.

I am the one coming undone. My consciousness is a failing engine, desperately trying to fill its holes with fragments of memories stolen from everyone I’ve ever glanced at. I am ceasing to be a person and becoming a collection of ""parts.""

Right now, I’m sitting in my room, and the edges of reality are blurring. My coffee mug flickers between red and black. I can no longer trust what I see, what I feel, or even who I am.

But the worst part is when I close my eyes. Because that’s when I see them. Formless, dark entities sliding along the periphery of my mind. They don’t have faces yet. They are waiting for me to finish falling apart so they can pick up the pieces.",11,1770406500.0,shortscarystories,0,1.0,False

**Memory Transcript Subject: Novarra, Arxur, Wildlife Management Agent, \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service\]**

**Date \[standardized human time\]: October 9th, 2141**

There was noise outside. Soft. Indistinct.

Scrapes and murmurs filtered through the wall, blurred by sleep. I heard movement without meaning. Shapes without names.

My eyes stayed closed. My body stayed heavy. Warm blankets held me down while my mind drifted in that half-space where the world isn’t real yet.

A powerful *thud* impacted against the wall at my back, sending vibrations through my body.

My eyes opened.

Footsteps in the corridor. The scrape of *claws on metal. The muffled voices of prey—too many, too close—louder than normal.*

*A new shipment? A recent raid? I couldn’t make out words. I didn’t need to. I could smell Venlil.*

*My stomach clenched.*

*Not again.*

*I didn’t want to do it again. I didn’t want to fight. I didn’t want to kill. I didn’t want to eat.*

*My body moved anyway.*

*I was out of the bed before thought caught up to action, claws at the ready, breath tight in my chest. I faced the door. I checked angles. I searched for the point where the first guard would appear.*

*Threat.*

*Lock. Gap. Hinge side. Window. Blind corner. Where my gear wasn’t.*

*Too loud. Too many bodies. I could hear the small ones.*

*I tried to swallow. My throat locked.*

*""Nova?"" Vreska whispered behind me—*

*Who is Nova?*

Outside, the movement shifted—another scrape, a muttered apology, an embarrassed laugh—sounds that didn’t fit the surroundings, the cell—wait...bedroom?

“Nova.”

Jana’s voice cut through the static like a shock of lightning.

Calm. Low.

I didn’t answer. My throat had locked itself shut, and my pulse thundered painfully throughout my body. My attention stayed pinned on the door, body still convinced of the danger on the other side.

The bed rustled behind me. Wool against fabric. A small, quick inhale.

Vel’s scent grew stronger—warm and soft and *his*—and it brought me the rest of the way back.

Jana sat up, slow and deliberate. She didn’t come closer, but gave me space while I remembered how to breathe normally.

“Novarra,” she called out once more, and I collapsed to my knees on the floor.

I blinked, hard, and my eyes stung as if the air had turned sharp. If my stomach hadn't already been empty, I would have vomited.

Jana’s gaze was steady, the deep blue in the dark sclera flashing in the dim light filtering through the curtain. She held one clawed hand out halfway.

“You’re here,” she said. “With me. With Vel.”

He sat beside her, watching me. Not with fear or anxiety, but with concern and affection.

“You're safe."" It was such a simple thing, but his soft voice soothed the last of the trembling nerves inside of me.

No screams.

No crying.

No… wet, sudden silence.

My chest cracked open with a bone-shuddering sob.

They were at my side instantly.

Jana's familiar weight pressed into me. Veltep's warmth and softness draped over my back.

And then my own body betrayed me with a tremor.

It started in my hands. A ripple I couldn’t stop. Adrenaline dumped out of me like water from a cracked canteen.

I swallowed hard, tasted iron, and forced myself to clasp my hands together, gripping tight.

“Sorry,” I managed.

Jana’s mouth twitched. “Don’t,” she said simply.

Vel pressed closer, his warm wool comforting against my scales. We all sat there for a while, letting my pulse stop trying to crawl out of my throat. I wasn't sure how long. A few minutes? An hour? Eventually my body stopped trying to randomly shake itself apart, and Vel noticed.

""Doing any better?"" he asked, his chin resting on my shoulder and his arms wrapped around me from behind.

“Fine,” I said automatically.

I caught Jana's glare from the side, and Vel's ears flicked back in a tiny, exasperated little movement that made me want to laugh and also made my chest hurt.

I exhaled through my nose. “Fine-ish.”

“That’s more honest,” Jana said, her tail giving mine a light swat.

I huffed a sound that might’ve been a laugh.

The hallway outside erupted in another round of excited voices, and this time my body didn’t leap out of itself.

Jana’s hand slid up my arm to my shoulder, careful around the tender spot, and squeezed once.

“You want me to come with you today?” she asked.

It was an honest offer. A silent question. *""Do you want support?""*

I shook my head once. “I'll be alright.”

Jana’s brow ridge lifted a fraction.

“I'll manage,” I corrected. ""It'll do me some good to get used to all the commotion.""

Vel shifted, his paw rubbing down my arm, seeking out my hand. I brought it up for him, and he gripped as much as he could. ""If you feel that's best, but if it gets to be too much again, you can call, and I'll come to you.""

A soft chuff left my throat at that, and I turned my head to nuzzle into his neck, letting myself sink into the wool for a moment as I showed my appreciation for—

I finally noticed the bed. The sheets were a mess, twisted and warm, and... Well, it was very obvious we'd spent most of yesterday tangled up together in there.

My face heated in a way I refused to acknowledge once I realized there was other evidence of our enthusiastic activities.

Jana’s mouth quirked, catching my look like she’d snagged it on a hook.

“We should probably—” I started.

“Yeah,” Jana said, far too smug. “We should start washing up.”

Vel beeped softly with embarrassed amusement, ears flicking back.

The little curl in his tail betrayed the satisfaction he felt at the memory, though.

I wasn't quite ready to stand up yet, so I offered to strip the bed while Jana and Vel took the first shower.

It was a small thing. Practical. Simple. Something I could do with my hands while my brain finished its reset.

Jana didn’t argue. She leaned in, bumped her head gently against mine, and got up. Then, with a grin that fit far too well in the dim lighting, wrapped her hand around Vel's paw. “We'll try not to use all the hot water.”

Vel’s tail swished once in amusement.

“I’ll make sure she behaves,” he reassured me, and then leaned in to give me a lick on the cheek before following her out of the bedroom.

The shower started up behind the bathroom door, a rush of water that turned into muffled voices—Jana’s low rumble, Vel’s softer replies—and for a few minutes, I just let the sounds of the building settle back around me.

—

I turned the water off with my tail, sighing as the steam wafted out from around me when I slipped open the shower door. I toweled off, letting the air clear a bit before beginning to dress for the day, and stepped out to find the apartment smelled like breakfast.

My mouth watered at the rich fragrance of spiced, fatty meat and the heady scent of fluffy eggs. The aromatics of a pot of herbal tea and the sharp sting of brewed coffee intermingled, a bitter but welcome note to the feast.

Vel had claimed the center of the couch, his breakfast on the coffee table before him. A plate of toasted strayu that he had delighted in finding at the store recently, with margarine and some fruit jam, along with a mug of tea cupped between his paws. Jana was on the far side of him from me, pad in her hand, tapping away with that quick efficiency that kept her ahead of the rest of the PR people. Her breakfast sat partially nibbled on the table, and I could see mine waiting for me.

Vel’s ears perked when he saw me, and he lifted his mug slightly like a greeting.

Jana’s eyes flicked up, checked my face, checked my posture, and then she nodded once, satisfied.

“Better?” she asked.

“A lot,” I admitted.

Vel’s tail swished gently. Content.

I took my seat and grabbed my plate.

My tail tucked in behind Vel, resting over top of his, and finding Jana's, all three winding together loosely. We ate, and for a few minutes we were just three bodies sharing a morning like normal people.

Then Jana set her mug down. “I've got some papers to file, and I want to check on a few things in town hall,” she announced.

Vel acknowledged her with a flick of his ears. ""I got a message from Amanda that they wouldn't need me at the station today. I think I'm going to make a few calls and check the shop back home. Then see if I can chat with Lucius too.""

I felt a low rumble in my chest as I watched his ears and tail perk with excitement at the thought of his husband. ""Good. Have you talked at all about him coming here toward the end of the program?""

His tail started to wag, as much as it could while twisted with ours. ""Yeah! That's the part that I'm checking on. I have to make sure we aren't going to get a delivery with the shop closed up or something.""

Jana grinned. ""He's been fun to chat with; I'm excited to actually meet with him.""

Veltep looked like he was going to burst with joy hearing that. I placed my hand on his head, fingers curling in the wool gently as his ears relaxed and a soft purr escaped his chest.

""I've gotta get moving. I don't want to be late for the checkup,"" I mumbled into my mug, finishing the coffee and getting up. Vel gave a playful beep in protest when my hand pulled away. I moved around to the other side, giving a brief touch to Jana's shoulder as I moved to the door.

""Let us know if you need us,"" she called gently, looking up at me with serious eyes.

""I will.""

**Date \[standardized human time\]: October 9th, 2141**

The air was still humid and warm by the time I made it back onto the main street, my pad already flickering with multiple tabs and lists.

I walked with my head up, sunglasses firmly in place against the late afternoon summer sun, and my thumbs moving over the screen as I talked to half the town and the station at the same time.

""Alright, anything else on the checklist?""

**Town Hall: Paperwork.**

Yansa’s ears had flicked in that neat, efficient way she had when she was already thinking three steps ahead of you. She’d taken the envelopes without complaint, double-checked names, and slid my copies back across the counter with a satisfied little tail sway.

**Forms handed off. Confirmations squared away.**

I’d promised her I’d stop making her job harder by showing up with “just one more thing” right before lunch.

I hadn’t promised I’d succeed.

The next note on my screen glowed like it was laughing at me.

**Mayor McAddams: Touched base.**

The mayor had been in one of those moods where his eyes lit up every time he said the words *""community outreach,""* like it was a spell that could fix everything if he believed in it enough. He’d pitched a Q&A again, and I told him we would be delighted to do it.

Just… not soon.

Not while the investigations were only beginning. He'd had some pointed and admittedly intelligent questions about that too. He was decent at the job, and I could see him winning his next election easily if nothing too major fucked things up.

I flicked my claws across the pad and sent a quick note to the internal group chat for the public office, now that I was thinking about it: **Draft some starter questions for Q&A. Need to determine public response to bringing along some 'safe' wildlife too.**

When Mayor McAddams answered with a thumbs-up and a smiley face, I snorted. 

Going back to the checklist, the next item crossed off was one I had been dreading.

**Dooley: Check-in.**

Sheriff James Dooley wasn’t built for a town that could double overnight. None of us were, really, but Dooley wore it on his face. The lines around his mouth had gotten deeper since the transport arrived. He’d still tried to play it off with a grin and that tired, stubborn drawl.

“Appreciate you stoppin’ by, Miss Jana.”

Usually, Dooley took his time. Rather, he did a damned good job of wasting everyone else's. But today we’d gone over the concerns he had immediately and gotten right to business. The borders of town, all of our newcomers, and the ways people could cause trouble by accident as often as with intent.

My biggest concern was that he still didn’t have any deputies, and with our investigation worries, he was going to have less access to Nova, Roger, and Thomas for support. But now he had a growing pool of settlers who knew how to hold a flashlight and follow directions.

""I getcha,"" he promised. He would start vetting volunteers, bring a few extra eyes into the loop, and keep watch on the roads that fed into Blue Hope, along with doing his best to watch the edges of town while they continued to expand.

All in all, it had been a productive day.

People moved past me in little clusters—parents shepherding kids to and from the park. A pair of venlil, their ears constantly flickering, navigated the main street with its array of new shop signs. A Gojid hauled a crate into the doors of some new venture.

Heads turned when I passed.

Some faces lit with recognition. Some eyes widened and then snapped away. A surprising amount didn't react at all.

The apartment building came into view when I turned onto the main street, and soon after I caught sight of the community board near the entrance. It was a riot of color and letters in a multitude of languages. What used to be an empty corkboard behind glass, which barely had more than three pieces of paper tacked to it, was now literally bursting at the edges with flyers, corners of paper sticking out of the case's frame.

Handwritten notes. Printed posters. Sketches. Photos taped crooked. The “Need help” tabs dangled like little teeth. A child’s drawing of the apartment building with a carpet of different people around the bottom.

I stopped short as I was passing by it and laughed. My eyes caught the words printed on the newest addition slapped right in the middle.

**MOVIE NIGHT TONIGHT!**

Someone had added little stars around the title and a note at the bottom in bright marker: *Bring blankets. Bring snacks. Bring your neighbors.*

My mood lifted so fast I thought I was floating for a second. It didn't say what the movie was going to be, but that wouldn't matter. What should we bring for snacks? Maybe we can hit up the grocery store? Oh! if I can find out who's organizing, I can see about connecting them with Rosie and—

A small, bright mass of fluff rounded the corner too fast and collided into me.

*Okay, why do the herbivores keep doing that?*

They didn't run into me hard enough to fall on their butt, but I did hear a soft little bleat and felt a hard snout push into my belly. Ears pinned back against their head, they hopped back, their entire body going rigid with embarrassment.

“Whoa,” I said, light and easy. “Careful, you almost bounced off me.”

I recognized him now that his face wasn't shoved into my stomach.

*Pretty sure he's that girl's father, the one that climbed Nova.*

His eyes were wide, and he forced a shaky breath.

“I—I’m so sorry!” he stammered, words tumbling. “I didn’t see—I didn’t—”

“It’s fine,” I cut in, still smiling. “You okay?”

He blinked. “I’m—yes. Yes. I’m okay.” His tail twitched in tight little circles, betraying him. “I just… didn’t expect anyone would be—”

“Around the corner?” I offered, tail swaying slightly as I brought a hand up to tilt my glasses up, smirking down at him.

“Standing in front of the board,"" he admitted, ears drooping.

I let out a chortle, and a second later, a taller venlil with pure black wool came around the corner right after him. Her gaze snapped to her partner—then to me—then back again. I didn't get a chance to judge what she was thinking, as a tiny black-and-white blur barreled out from behind her, clinging to her mother's tail.

“Miss Jana!”

Falka was hopping excitedly, tail whipping so hard it looked like she might take flight.

Her dad’s ears flicked in sharp, parental alarm.

“Falka—!”

I laughed, because I couldn’t help it, and crouched down so I wasn’t towering over her.

“Hey, sweetie,” I greeted, keeping my voice warm and casual. “You’re gonna knock your poor dad over one of these days.”

Falka let out a bleating giggle, the sound melting my heart.

Her mother let out an exasperated sigh at her daughter's antics.

“Jana,” she greeted cautiously, voice low. “Sorry—she’s… very excited.”

“It’s fine,” I said again, and meant it. “I’m glad you’re settling in...”

Her partner cleared his throat, still mortified. “I’m Falek, a-and this is Vika.”

“Nice to meet you both properly,” I said, and kept a hand hovering near as Falka scampered up to sit on my knee. She looked up at me with an unexpected intensity, ears and tail erratically signing for attention.

“What's up, sweetie?” I asked.

She leaned in, all warm wool and wiggles as her little paws pressed on my shoulders, and she immediately tucked her snout close like she was about to tell me state secrets.

Her whisper tickled the scales at my neck.

“Drej—” she started, then corrected herself with a proud little huff. “Miss Jana. Um. We keep getting the itchy prickers in our fur.”

I blinked once.

“What?” I asked quietly, matching her volume just out of sheer confusion.

“The burrs!” she hissed, like the word itself was offensive. “Me and Pel and the other kids. And Mama too. We can’t find the plant. We look and look and it’s not there!” Her ears drooped dramatically. “They’re itchy.”

Behind her, Vika’s ears angled forward, listening along with Falek. A look of shared understanding passed between them.

""So that's why she kept asking to go see the Rangers."" Vika chuckled.

""I'm still a bit lost,"" I prompted.

Falka bobbed his tail. ""Since it's going to take time for that playground to be finished, the kids spend most of their paws playing in the park. Almost all of them, Falka certainly included, get these little burrs caught in their fur and wool just about every day. It's not a big problem, but it can be very irritating to comb out.""

I kept my face open and friendly, even as my mind filed the information into a neat little drawer.

None of the plants in the park should have any burrs, and they sure as hell didn’t walk into town on their own.

But obviously, they did hitch rides.

Usually on wildlife.

Sometimes on kids.

And sometimes on someone coming in from the deeper forest.

Out loud, I chuckled, playing off the thoughts running through my head.

“Alright,” I told Falka. “Next time you find one, bring it to one of us. Or take a picture on your pad if you can't get to me or Nova.”

Her eyes widened. ""You can find it?”

“I can at least figure out what it is from the databases,” I said. “And if I don’t know, I know exactly which old human in town will.”

“Dr. Flinntock?” Vika guessed instantly.

I laughed again. “Yeah. He’s been talking to a bunch of you about making a garden?” I guessed.

Falka looked very pleased at the idea. ""As a matter of fact, he has. I think it would be lovely, especially if we can find space for a community vegetable garden.” She added, ""Of course, it will be contained,"" as I opened my muzzle.

I snorted softly, my tail thumping lightly on the sidewalk as I gently took hold of Falka, wrapping my arms around her middle and setting her down on her feet. Her tail wagged as she hurried back over to grasp her mother's tail once again.

“You three going to the movie later?"" I asked, curious.

Vika’s gaze flicked to the board, then back. “Pretty sure the whole building is going to try.”

Falka’s ears shot up again. “We’re going! Mama said we can bring cookies!”

Falek made a noise that was half sigh, half surrender. ""The pups are going to get all hopped up on sugar."" His tail wagged as he said it, though.

“Alright,” I said, cheerful. “I’ve gotta check with the guys, but I’m sure we’ll be there too.”

**Memory Transcript Subject: Veltep, Venlil, Volunteer For Wildlife Management, \[Colony/Vishnu Ranger Service\]**  
**Date \[standardized human time\]:** **October 9th, 2141**

The common room had been completely transformed.

Blankets covered every surface from one end to the other. Extra chairs had been dragged in from apartments. Kids claimed the carpet in a loose, wriggling pile, tails and feet sticking out at impossible angles, while parents hovered with the same wary vigilance they always had.

Someone adjusted the projector for the third time.

“Too high,” a human voice said.

“It’s *fine*,” a venlil replied, though their ears were pinned in a way that said it was not fine at all.

I sank into the corner of the sofa I’d claimed early and let the noise settle over me.

I watched the room the way I’d gotten used to watching everything since arriving on Vishnu. An observer of a strange new way of life. I had expected to only be concerned with strange new animals, interesting plant life, and figuring out how an almost perfectly untouched ecosystem really worked.

Sure, aliens living in a community were fairly common everywhere, but they were usually a minority, a rare sight within another species' homeworld or colony. I don't think I'd ever seen such a diverse mix of people as this before in my life.

Nova and Drej were still standing near the entrance, talking with a small knot of neighbors. Drej’s posture was easy as always, shoulders relaxed, tail loosely swaying behind her. She exuded this positive energy while she spoke; warm, practiced, and confident.

Nova… looked different.

Not physically, exactly. He was still *Nova.* Still built like a threat, whether he meant to be or not. But his stance wasn’t rigid tonight. His shoulders weren’t up around his ears. He was listening more than scanning, letting the conversation tug him along instead of bracing against it.

He even made a small, dry comment that earned a snorting laugh from a human.

My tail swayed against the sofa cushion before I realized I was doing it. The sight reminded me of that first day in town, when he'd finally relaxed. He wasn't expecting anyone to panic at the sight of him now.

I lifted my paw and flicked an ear, catching their attention instantly. I patted the sofa beside me.

*>Saved you a seat.<*

Drej’s grin flashed, and she excused herself with a little wave. Nova followed, offering a brief nod to the neighbors. They crossed the room and slid in on either side of me, the three of us fitting together like we’d been doing it for years.

Nova’s hand brushed the top of my head as he settled. Showing affection as well as anchoring himself. Drej’s arm draped across the back of the sofa behind me, her soft body pressing into my side. I leaned into them both with a soft trill of delight, letting my head rest on Drej's chest, while my tail twined around Nova's arm.

Havren spotted us as soon as we’d gathered and carefully made his way through the crowd. The gojid dad held up a bag in one claw, the plastic crinkling. “Hey,” he said, voice pitched carefully, like he didn’t want to startle the whole room. “I, uh… I meant to give you this earlier. For the other day.”

Jerky! I looked up at the stunned look on the twins' faces and stifled the laugh that tried to come out.

“Oh!” Nova said, blinking a few times before reaching out for the bag. “Thank you.”

Havren huffed a small laugh, spines shifting. “Figured you’d appreciate it more than I would. I like it well enough, but it's still a little strange to me. My kids keep getting into the stash, though, and I know too much of this is bad for both of them.” He laughed a little louder at that, his tail bruhing the carpet lightly.

Drej’s tail thumped once behind me in amusement.

Havren’s spines settled into a more relaxed angle, and he glanced back over his shoulder. “Looks like I'm being called.”

I leaned a little to look and noticed Marevi tucked into one corner of a plush, single-seat chair, her ears tinged a soft purple as she waved for Havren to join her.

I gave the gojid a knowing smirk, ears wiggling. His ears quickly turned blue before he coughed, waving a paw and mumbling for us to enjoy the movie before hurrying off.

Nova had set the bag in my lap, and both of them were plucking little bits of their gift out and nibbling gently. I glanced up at the screen where the projector was still trying to find a flat, bright image.

“So,” I said, tilting my ears toward the excited chatter around us. “What did they pick?”

Drej’s expression lit up like she'd been waiting for me to ask.

“The Princess Bride,” she announced, with the exact same reverence some people reserved for scripture.

Nova made a sound in the back of his throat. “Of course it is.”

Drej leaned over my head, grin sharp. “Don’t ‘of course’ me. It’s all-ages. It’s funny. It has sword fights. It has drama. It has romance *and* revenge. It’s perfect.”

“It’s your favorite,” Nova said, voice dry.

Drej’s tail flicked. “It’s a *classic.*”

“It’s a classic that you personally walked over there and campaigned for,” Nova continued, tilting his head toward the projector setup.

“I simply suggested that—”

“You didn’t ‘suggest,’ you-”

“I *charmed* them,” Drej corrected, offended on principle. “I negotiated. I provided compelling arguments.”

Nova’s eyes narrowed in mock suspicion. “Did you quote it at them?”

Drej’s smile widened.

Nova sighed like he’d been personally wronged by her joy. “She quoted it at them,” he told me.

“I did not—”

Nova cut in immediately, too smooth. “*Inconceivable.*”

I let out a startled beep-laugh at the silly voice he managed.

Drej gasped, all theater. “Oh, don’t you start. You don’t even use that word right.”

Nova’s mouth twitched. “I’m using it *exactly* right.”

“You’re teasing,” Drej accused, but her tone was warm.

“I’m teasing,” Nova admitted.

Of course I’d seen it before. This movie has survived literal centuries as a subculture phenomenon. Lucius had presented the film to me like a cultural treasure and replayed it like comfort food. And he’d made sure I knew exactly why this one mattered to him.

Still… seeing it again with *them*—with Drej practically vibrating with delight and Nova pretending he wasn’t—felt like a different kind of treat.

Then Nova added with the faintest softening, “It’s actually a good pick. The kids won’t get bored, and the adults won’t feel like they’re trapped in a children’s lesson.”

Drej snuggled in even closer, voice dropping into conspiratorial delight. “Vel, it’s one of those movies where everyone has a line they love. You’re going to hear everyone quoting it at each other for the next week; it's impossible for anyone to resist.”

My ears perked, and I couldn’t hold back. “Nonsense,” I trilled softly. “You only say that because no one ever has.”

Her eyes slowly widened, and I thought for a moment that she might actually burst from excitement.

Nova’s hand returned to my head, fingers combing lightly through my wool as he spoke, casual and steady. “Careful there, *Westley*,” he murmured, eyes on Drej. “If you keep that up, she's gonna make you miss half the movie.” His voice rumbled gently into my ear, the implication and the sound sending a shiver through my wool.

Drej made a pleased little sound and bumped her shoulder into him affectionately. ""I dunno, I'm pretty sure I'd at least wait until the credits.""

She tucked her muzzle down to my other ear. ""See? He pretends to hate it, but he's worried about missing any of it.”

Nova’s tail tip flicked. “I never said I hate it.”

“You just act like you’re suffering,” Drej said.

“It’s called *maintaining dignity*,” Nova replied.

Over my head, they kept it up. A playful, familiar bickering that felt right.

It was ridiculous.

It was perfect.

And then my pad buzzed.

The vibration startled against my thigh, sharp through the layers of blanket. I froze for a fraction of a second before my paw found it, curious who it could be from. I'd just spent nearly a claw chatting with Lucius already.

My stomach dropped before I even read the name.

*Mom.*

My ears went hot.

I clicked the message open.

**We saw the news about that program you're in on Vishnu.**

**Are you safe? Call us when you can. We want to hear your voice.**

My vision narrowed around the screen.

The room kept chattering. Pups giggled. Someone argued about volume again. The projector finally threw a bright rectangle onto the wall.

None of it felt real for a moment.

Because suddenly I could see my parents’ living room back on Skalga. My mother pacing. My father sitting too stiff, trying to pretend he wasn’t worried. The little photo frames on the shelf. The feeling of home.

*What do I even say?*

Not just *I’m safe.*

How did I explain Nova? Drej? The fact that I’d chosen them, chosen *this?*

My paw tightened around the pad.

Nova’s hand stilled on my head. Drej noticed the change immediately. She leaned back just enough to look down at my face.

“Vel?” she asked, voice gentle.

I swallowed. My throat felt too small.

“My parents,” I said.

They shared a glance. Drej’s eyes softened in a way that still surprised me. “What’d they say?”

I turned the pad so they could see. My ears were still burning.

Nova read it, then exhaled slowly through his nose. Drej’s expression didn’t change at all. “Okay,” she said, like we were discussing the weather. “We can do that. When you’re ready.”

Nova nodded once. “No rush.”

My tail curled tighter around his arm. “I don’t…” I started, then stopped. I didn’t want to admit it out loud, but the truth sat like a stone in my chest.

I didn’t fear my parents.

I feared disappointing them.

I feared hearing the worry in their voices and knowing it would be my fault.

Drej’s paw found my shoulder, fingers warm through my fur. “We’ll handle it when you’re ready,” she said again, confident in the way she always was. “And we can be there with you if you want. If you think it'd help at all. You don’t have to do it alone.”

Nova’s voice came quieter, careful in a way that made my chest ache. “Whatever you want to say. Whenever you want to say it. We follow your lead.”

He hesitated, just a flicker, then added honestly, “They’re your parents. And it’s your life when you go back home.”

That last part made my eyes sting.

Because it was true.

This wasn’t just a phone call.

It was the bridge between who I’d been and who I was becoming.

I looked at the message again.

The room cheered softly as the projector finally caught the opening screen.

Drej and Nova were still arguing under their breath about whether the film “started too slow,” but now it was gentle, a habit more than a fight.

I breathed in.

Out.

“I'll call them in the morning,” I decided, voice small but steady. “Just to let them know I’m okay. I'll tell them I have something to talk to them about, and we can figure it out after.”

Drej’s smile turned warm. “Good choice.”

Nova’s hand resumed its slow, grounding pet over my head. “We’ll be here.”

I tucked the pad face-down between the cushions so I wouldn’t keep staring at it.

The movie began.

**""This is my favorite book in all the world, though I have never read it.""**

1qxrg50,https://www.reddit.com/r/Strongerman/comments/1qxrg50/the_neuroscience_of_resetting_your_motivation/,The Neuroscience of Resetting Your Motivation System What Actually Works,"okay so i've been deep diving into this for months now because i was basically a zombie. like scrolling for hours, starting projects and abandoning them day 3, that kind of thing. turns out our brains are literally getting hijacked by dopamine manipulation and most of us have zero idea it's happening.

this isn't some ""just try harder"" BS. i've been reading research, listening to neuroscientists, watching lectures from stanford professors. and honestly? the problem isn't that we're lazy or broken. our motivation circuits are just completely fried from modern life. social media, junk food, porn, endless notifications. they're all exploiting the same neural pathways that evolved to keep us alive. but here's the thing, once you understand how it works, you can actually fix it.

# 1. understand what's actually broken

your brain has this thing called the dopamine reward system. it's supposed to motivate you toward meaningful goals. survival stuff. but now it's getting bombarded with supernormal stimuli that didn't exist 50 years ago. dr andrew huberman talks about this constantly on his podcast. every time you get a like, eat something hyperpalatable, or watch something designed to grip your attention, you're getting dopamine hits that are WAY higher than anything natural.

the issue? your brain adapts. it raises the baseline. suddenly normal stuff like reading a book or having a conversation feels boring as hell because the dopamine release is too subtle. you're not broken, you're just overstimulated.

""Dopamine Nation"" by dr anna lembke (stanford psychiatrist, literally wrote THE book on addiction medicine) breaks this down perfectly. she won the california book award and this thing is insanely good. the core idea is that we're all living in an age of dopamine overload and our brains are desperately trying to maintain balance by becoming less sensitive. this book will make you question everything you think you know about pleasure and pain. best neuroscience book i've read in years. she explains how the pleasure-pain balance works and why we're all basically chasing diminishing returns.

# 2. do a proper dopamine detox (not the cringe version)

real dopamine detox isn't sitting in a dark room for 24 hours. it's about removing the highest dopamine activities for a set period so your baseline can reset. [dr lembke](https://www.annalembke.com) recommends 30 days for serious addictions, but even 7 to 14 days makes a difference for general motivation issues.

cut out or massively reduce: social media, video games, junk food, porn, mindless youtube/netflix binges, online shopping. basically anything that gives you pleasure without effort.

i know that sounds extreme but stick with me. the first few days SUCK. you'll be bored, irritable, restless. that's withdrawal. your brain is recalibrating. by week 2, normal activities start feeling rewarding again. reading becomes interesting. conversations become engaging. work becomes less painful.

insight timer is clutch for this phase. it's a meditation app but way less corporate than calm. has thousands of free guided meditations specifically for managing cravings and restlessness. the withdrawal phase is where most people fail, and having guided support helps massively.

# 3. rebuild motivation with friction and effort

here's the counterintuitive part. once you've reset, you want to reintroduce dopamine through EARNED rewards, not passive consumption. your brain needs to relearn that effort precedes pleasure.

dr huberman has this whole protocol about leveraging effort as the reward itself. basically, you train yourself to get dopamine from the struggle, not just the outcome. sounds weird but it works.

start with small challenges that require genuine effort. cold showers (classic but effective), workouts, learning something difficult, creating instead of consuming. the key is that it has to feel slightly uncomfortable. that's the signal to your brain that something meaningful is happening.

if you want to go deeper on the neuroscience but don't have energy for dense textbooks, there's this app called [BeFreed ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/learn-anything-befreed/id6739747450)that pulls from behavioral psychology research, neuroscience books, and expert talks to create personalized audio learning plans. you tell it something like ""i'm stuck in a dopamine cycle and want to rebuild my motivation system"" and it generates a structured plan with episodes ranging from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples and context. the content comes from vetted sources like the books mentioned here plus research papers and expert interviews, all fact-checked. you can customize the voice too, i use the deeper one during workouts. it's been useful for connecting the dots between all this neuroscience stuff without having to hunt down every source manually.

""Atomic Habits"" by james clear (sold over 15 million copies, this dude knows behavior change) has the best framework for this. won awards left and right. this is the best habit building book i've ever read, hands down. he breaks down exactly how to design your environment and systems to make effortful behaviors automatic. the 2 minute rule alone changed how i approach everything. instead of ""i need to work out for an hour"" it's ""i need to put on gym clothes"" and the rest follows naturally.

# 4. fix your dopamine baseline with boring fundamentals

i hate that this matters but it does. sleep, exercise, sunlight, real food. they're not optional if you want your motivation system working properly.

sleep first. dr matthew walker (berkeley neuroscience professor) has shown that even one night of bad sleep tanks dopamine receptor sensitivity by like 20%. get 7-8 hours, same time every night. ""Why We Sleep"" is essential reading here but honestly his podcast appearances sum it up well.

morning sunlight. [huberman ](https://www.hubermanlab.com)is obsessed with this. 10-15 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking sets your circadian rhythm and optimizes dopamine production throughout the day. no sunglasses. just go outside with your coffee.

exercise but make it strategic. resistance training is better for dopamine than cardio. something about progressive overload and achieving small wins. doesn't need to be complicated. stronglifts 5x5 or any basic program works.

real food. processed stuff spikes dopamine artificially then crashes it. whole foods provide steady neurotransmitter precursors. l-tyrosine from protein converts to dopamine. you don't need to be neurotic about it, just eat mostly real stuff.

# 5. use strategic dopamine spikes

once your system is reset, you can reintroduce high dopamine activities strategically as rewards AFTER effort. but you have to be intentional about it.

finish a hard work session, THEN scroll for 15 minutes. complete a workout, THEN play video games for an hour. the sequence matters. your brain learns to associate the effort with the upcoming reward and starts releasing dopamine during the work itself.

""The Molecule of More"" by daniel lieberman and michael long explains this brilliantly. lieberman is a professor of psychiatry and clinical neuroscience at george washington university. the book explores how dopamine controls not just pleasure but anticipation and desire. this book is a total mind bender about how dopamine is actually a future-oriented molecule, not a pleasure chemical. completely changed how i think about motivation. around 300 pages but reads super fast.

they talk about how dopamine is released MORE during the pursuit than the achievement, which explains why we lose interest once we get what we want. understanding this lets you design better reward systems.

# 6. manage your dopamine triggers ruthlessly

your environment is constantly cuing dopaminergic responses. phone notifications, food in your pantry, netflix autoplay, youtube recommendations. every cue triggers a craving cycle.

remove the cues. delete apps or use app blockers during work hours. one sec is a good app for this, adds friction before opening social media. don't keep junk food visible. turn off all non essential notifications.

replace environmental cues with better ones. leave a book where you usually scroll. put gym clothes next to your bed. make the good behaviors obvious and the bad ones invisible.

# 7. embrace strategic boredom

this is probably the most important thing nobody talks about. boredom is ESSENTIAL for motivation. when you're bored, your brain starts seeking meaningful stimulation. but we never let ourselves be bored anymore.

every moment of potential boredom gets filled. waiting in line? phone. commercials? phone. between tasks? phone. your brain never gets the chance to generate internal motivation.

try this: when you feel bored, just sit with it for 5 minutes before reaching for stimulation. no phone, no music, nothing. let your mind wander. you'll notice it naturally starts planning, problem solving, getting curious about things. that's your organic motivation system coming back online.

neuroscientist dr sandi mann has done fascinating research on this. boredom triggers creativity and goal directed behavior, but only if you don't immediately escape it.

the whole system takes probably 30-60 days to fully reset depending on how fried you were starting out. but you'll notice changes within the first week or two. things that felt impossible suddenly feel doable. not because you're more disciplined but because your brain is finally responding normally to natural rewards again.

nobody talks about this but our entire generation is basically operating with compromised motivation systems and wondering why willpower doesn't work. it's not a you problem. it's a dopamine problem. fix the biology and the behavior follows naturally.",1,1770406362.0,Strongerman,0,1.0,False
1qxrezv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mildlynomil/comments/1qxrezv/give_it_to_me_straight_am_i_being_too_sensitive/,Give it to me straight - am I being too sensitive?,"I’ve had a rough go with my MIL since the moment I became pregnant. Bombarding me while pregnant, sharing our news before we got the chance too, kissing the baby and when asked not too, constantly asking to babysit from newborn to now (9 months), and making comments about being disappointed she’s not the number 1 women in my husband life now.  

Things have improved somewhat as our baby has gotten older and mobile. So I suggested to my husband and in-laws we go on a little trip - this is something we’ve done twice with my family now, and since we don’t allow them to babysit (yes bc they over step, but primarily due to them being older and have a tough time mobility wise) I thought this would be a nice way to lean in and build some memories. 

The trip was three nights, and two full days. And now I can’t even stomach the thought of being in the same room as them, here’s why - 

\- I would speak, and literally they would not respond to me (MIL, FIL, BIL). Example: I put baby down for bed, I came out to the common room and saw they waited to start dinner for me (very nice!), so I said “oh wow, you didn’t have to wait for me. Thank you so much.” Crickets; no response just sat on their phones and did not acknowledge me. A couple minutes later MIL said, I’m hungry can we eat now? 

Or another time, we woke up and I walked out into the common room with baby in my arms. MIL was there doing dishes, so I said “good morning!” Literally no response. Instead she walked over to me and looked at baby and said “how’s my baby, good morning my baby.” When husband came out, it was all “oooo good morning honey, do you want coffee? How did you sleep?” 

\- MIL would constantly redirect baby away from me. If I came into the room or if we were all sitting playing with baby together, baby would get excited and crawl over to me. MIL would grab baby and pull her back to her, or starting making loud noises with toys to try and get baby’s attention back. 

\- if I picked baby up or husband handed me baby, MIL would rush over and say “I’ll take baby, she needs grandma time.” If bay was being held by husband it was “look at baby and daddy, so perfect together” 

\- we left baby with MIL and FIL alone with baby for 5 minutes while we packed up the car. When we came back MIL said to me “I’m a qualified babysitter now, so you can start letting me babysit now” 

\- If MIL was holding baby and baby started to fuss, she would walk straight past me and try to give baby to FIL. I would have to go in and grab baby back. 

\- MIL made a whole fuss over not understanding why baby’s eyes were not brown (like husband) and that she didn’t understand where the blue eyes came from. I have blue eyes. 

\- On the second morning, FIL was making constant comments about how baby needed grandma time. As if MIL complained to FIL about not having enough time with baby. For example, FIL came and grabbed baby out of my arms and said baby needs to sit with grandma for grandmother time. Or I was feeding baby breakfast, and FIL said grandma get in there and feed your grandbaby breakfast. 

\- At dinner baby was fussing so husband (who was holding baby) says “baby wants mom”, well MIL springs up from her chair across the table and begins walking over to take baby. Husband passes baby to me (I am siting right next to husband and baby) and he says “no baby wants her mom”. MIL goes and sits back down. 

Husband says things in the moment like, baby wants mom or baby loves mom. But this seems to only make things worse - MIL will say “how could I forget, I know she loves mom” 

Sorry this is so long. But there are all things passive events that in isolation don’t seem like the worst, but all together just builds such an unwelcome environment. 

Anyway, I don’t know if I can stomach them. I’ve never been in a situation where someone seems to be upset over my existence. It’s extremely uncomfortable and not an environment I want my child seeing as they grow up.

1qxrd0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/ZZZ_Romance/comments/1qxrd0g/closeness_without_demands_yanagi_and_harumasas/,Closeness Without Demands: Yanagi and Harumasa’s Dynamic,"This is an exploration of why their bond is more complex than mere collegiality — and why, in this case, romance is not a gift of fate but a potentially dangerous risk.

In this essay, I would like to once again examine the relationship between Yanagi and Harumasa. I have already done so before, focusing on two similar scenes in which both of them broke established protocol and addressed each other by their given names. A link to this article can be found in the comments.. At the time, my analysis remained deliberately incomplete and was constrained by the chosen format. Now, I want to look at their relationship as a whole and reflect on how it might develop.

My goal here is not to prove anything to the reader, but to understand. For that reason, I want to be clear: my personal sympathy for a romantic interpretation of Yanagi and Harumasa’s relationship does not compromise the quality of this analysis. If anything, it may enrich it.

I hope you enjoy the reading.

# Their Fears as Mirrors of One Another

Harumasa lives with constant knowledge: his body is unreliable, his resources are finite, and his “later” is uncertain. This is not a depressive mindset — it is a fact of his life. From this fact grows a very specific fear: the closer I allow myself to be, the more it will hurt them when I am gone.

Harumasa does not plan for the future — not so much because he cannot, but because he does not allow himself to.

At the same time, Harumasa is afraid of becoming a burden. He feels compelled to constantly justify the resources others spend on him — treatment, accommodations, attention. He gives everything he has: risking himself on missions, carrying the emotional atmosphere of the office. Measuring his worth through usefulness, Harumasa believes he must “leave” before he becomes indebted to those he loves.

He lives with an internal countdown and the fear of becoming a source of pain once his resources run out. His question is simple and devastating:

“If I stay, will it only hurt them more?”

Yanagi’s sense of self has fused with her function. She does not merely perform the role of systems analyst and deputy commander — she is that role. Her “I” is built on competence, reliability, and problem-solving. From this emerge two fears and one central contradiction.

The fear of losing her function.

“If I stop being useful, who am I then? Do I have the right to simply exist without producing?” Without her function, her identity collapses; she feels like an empty space.

The fear of being reduced to her function.

“If I am valued only for my usefulness, then I am not seen as a whole person. They don’t see Yanagi — they see the brain of Section 6.” Her humanity is denied: her fatigue, her vulnerability, her right to weakness.

The contradiction.

She wants to be valued including her function, but not reduced to it. She wants to be needed for who she is, yet fears that without what she does, her “who” will not be enough.

Yanagi holds herself together through will and duty. She fears becoming unnecessary if she stops controlling and carrying responsibility. Her question mirrors his:

“If I step back — if I stop controlling — will it be easier for them?”

# A Language of Distance: Distance as a Form of Intimacy

Addressing each other by surname is their conscious language — a ritual that creates a safe professional distance. It is a shield that allows them to remain close without acknowledging an attachment that frightens them with its intensity and responsibility.

The spontaneous slips into first names — Yanagi’s in panic, Harumasa’s in farewell — are brief flashes of truth. They expose the depth of feeling and are immediately masked again, because the truth is too dangerous. These moments show that, internally, they have long since crossed into personal address.

# A Form of Care: Space, Not Pressure

Harumasa is the only one who does not use Yanagi’s intellect as a tool. Miyabi relies on her as a deputy commander; to Sokaku, she is a capable older sister. Both do this sincerely and without ill intent, yet precisely because of that, their support is dangerous for Yanagi — it reinforces her old role of being needed through function.

Harumasa is different. He does not seek her solutions when he can make decisions himself. He does not make her responsible for his condition. He uses the results of her work, not her. With Harumasa, Yanagi does not have to be the smartest person in the room in order to deserve being there.

He is also the one capable of answering her central question. He does not console her or offer advice. He states a fact, returning her right to be human:

“If you stop controlling things, it will be harder for us. But if you continue, it will hurt you.”

He acknowledges the value of her sacrifice while denying its necessity in that moment — giving her permission to stop. Only someone who has lived with the knowledge that their time is limited can offer such support. Harumasa helps Yanagi because he understands the cost of choices made for others.

Yanagi, in turn, does not pity Harumasa or lower her expectations.

She gives him space to be competent. She assigns him tasks according to his abilities, not his health. In doing so, she says:

“I see your skills, not your illness. I speak to your professionalism, not your diagnosis. You are an agent to me, not a patient.”

This restores his agency — the sense that he governs his life through action rather than passively enduring it. Her silent trust is not merely the absence of control; it is the creation of a platform on which he can prove his worth to himself. She does not praise him excessively, which would be patronizing. She simply assigns tasks — and accepts the result.

Trust is given in advance. And that is the strongest signal that he is already a constant in her equation.

Yanagi also includes Harumasa in plans for the future — “next time” — thereby silently rejecting his belief that he is temporary. She behaves as though his “later” is an objective reality, not a subjective anxiety. She does not ask whether there will be a “later.” She assumes there will be.

This is a soft but undeniable demand: to exist in the future she envisions. To be included in a plan is to be invited to share responsibility for that future. “We’ll do this” implies that he will be there to do it.

# The Essence of Their Bond: To See Without Demanding

Mutual recognition of vulnerability.

They see each other without illusion. Harumasa sees not Yanagi’s strength, but the mechanism behind it — effort, choice, function. Yanagi sees not laziness or trickery in Harumasa, but the careful rationing of a finite resource and the fear of being unnecessary.

Harumasa thinks:

“If her strength is only will, not an infinite resource, and my presence becomes the weight that breaks her… then am I not obliged to leave before I become the source of her pain?”

Her potential collapse because of him is the embodiment of his existential nightmare: being a toxic asset. That is why he is so desperate to self-eliminate — offering her strength, but without him.

Yanagi thinks:

“If he believes his value depends on usefulness, and that he must leave once he ceases to be useful… shouldn’t I think the same of myself?”

His possible departure embodies her own inner nightmare. That is why she resists his logic so fiercely, insisting that he is needed simply because he exists.

The refusal to use one another.

This is the central point. Both are accustomed to being instruments for others — Harumasa because of his illness, Yanagi because of her intellect and reliability. In their bond, this stops. They use the results of each other’s work, but they do not exploit one another’s personalities to solve emotional problems.

# What Their Bond Gives Each of Them

For Yanagi, it is the ability to breathe. With Harumasa, she does not have to be the smartest, most reliable, or most correct person to have value. He sees her as a person, not a function.

For Harumasa, it is the ability to allow himself to stay. Yanagi’s honest acceptance and her inclusion of him in the future grant him the moral right to stop seeing himself as temporary and to become part of something larger.

This is a bond between two people who have recognized each other’s existential value and therefore consciously renounced the right to interfere, demand, or rescue. It is an attachment that accepts a possible ending while valuing the present.

Their story is not about unspoken confessions, but about what they consciously choose not to say — because in their world, words carry too much weight and could destroy the fragile balance they have built.

It is precisely this awareness, this vision, and this refusal to exploit what they see that makes their bond unique and tragically powerful.

# Possible Development

Yanagi and Harumasa share respect for boundaries, a lack of desire to “fix” one another, similar attitudes toward duty, and a habit of caring without imposing. They know how to be close without pressure, silent without distance, supportive without saviorhood. I see this as an ideal foundation for mature relationships — yet there is a caveat.

Their current form is protective and compromise-based. It is comfortable because it does not require plans, a future, or decisions. If they were to become “ordinary,” Yanagi would have to allow herself to want something for herself, and Harumasa would have to accept that he has the right to be someone’s present, not just someone’s temporary presence. For both of them, that is more frightening than silence.

Yes, their bond could grow into genuine friendship or love. But precisely because this is possible, they refrain. Not due to a lack of feeling, but because of an awareness of consequences. Their current form is a compromise between closeness and safety—a way to matter to each other without destroying themselves.

Are they capable of confession?

Yes — but only if the pain of maintaining the status quo outweighs the fear of dismantling it. They already have moments of near-confession: the slips into first names, Harumasa’s farewell. These are pressure points. A full confession would require a crisis that renders their perfectly calibrated distance unbearable — perhaps if one of them stands at the edge, physically or emotionally, and silence becomes a direct threat rather than a protection.

A confession would not be a magical solution. It would not be an ending, but the beginning of a more difficult game.

For Harumasa, responsibility for another’s happiness could become unbearable. His fear — “when I’m gone, it will hurt her” — would turn from abstraction into concrete horror. He might withdraw even more aggressively, trying to close off a relationship he now deems too dangerous.

For Yanagi, the fear of being unnecessary would be replaced by the fear of emotional dependence. Love—especially for someone with an uncertain future—is maximal vulnerability and loss of control. She might attempt to overcompensate, managing both his health and their relationship, suffocating them both.

Their safe space would be destroyed. Labels like “couple” create expectations — time, reciprocity, plans. These are precisely what they both avoid. Their unique agreement to “see without demanding” would risk collapse under the weight of conventional expectations.

Their confession would resemble capitulation to truth rather than romantic climax. Painful, destabilizing, terrifying. Their brilliance lies in having built an ideal system for two traumatized people. Love, in its conventional sense, would require dismantling that system and building a new one on its ruins — not through self-sacrifice, but through mutual trust in fragility.

Romance, if possible at all, would not be flowers or grand declarations. It would be a continuation of their current path: a quiet, daily decision to see the other fully and not turn away — despite fear, despite the knowledge that even holding a hand might feel dangerous.

# A Brighter Scenario

There is, however, a lighter possibility — not a “happy ending,” but something slower and quietly unfolding. Confession could become the next step in their existing practice of respecting autonomy. Not a passionate declaration, but an honest admission:

*“You are more to me than a colleague. That scares me, and I don’t know what to do with it. But I don’t want to hide it, because lying to you would also be a form of using you.”*

*“I understand. I’m scared too. We don’t have to change anything. Just to know.”*

In this case, their bond would deepen into a conscious choice rather than a forced one. Harumasa would gain the right to accept care as a gift, not a debt. Yanagi would learn to accept vulnerability not as weakness, but as trust.

They would not become “ordinary.” They could create a third form, unique to them — where:

* Love is synonymous with “I see you and I do not demand.”
* The future is not a plan, but the phrase “I’ve left space for you, if you want it.”
* Commitment is not “I will always be with you,” but “while I am here, I am fully with you—and when I leave, I will do so without placing guilt upon you.”

The paradox is that precisely because they have all the components for profound intimacy, they stop one step short. This is not a lack of feeling, but an excess of responsibility toward feeling.

Their current bond is not “less than love,” but a brilliantly constructed shelter. They have taken the best of intimacy — understanding, acceptance, support—and cut away the worst of conventional relationships: ownership, demands, dependency, the burden of the future. It is not a foundation for a house, but a perfectly balanced bridge over an abyss.

They have consciously chosen a relationship in the conditional mood: if circumstances were different. But they are not. Their courage lies not in fighting circumstances, but in building within them a fragile, resilient form of mutual salvation.

This is not less than love. In their world, it may be more.

# Possible Healing

We could end here — but I care too much about them to do so. Under what conditions could romantic closeness become less painful and less dangerous? This is a question of healing points — factors that might reduce risk and allow a healthier form of intimacy.

Healing Scenarios for Harumasa: When the Future Stops Being a Betrayal

A shift in health — not necessarily a cure, but a stable, manageable chronic condition. When tomorrow stops being a lottery and becomes a difficult but predictable reality, he can plan not as a healthy person, but as someone who knows the rules of his game. Then “later” ceases to be a lie.

Acceptance through action. He has already begun this by remaining in Section 6. The next step is recognizing that his presence is already part of others’ futures. If Yanagi, Miyabi, and Sokaku demonstrate—through actions, trust, and long-term inclusion — that they count on him not despite his reality but with it integrated, his sense of being temporary may erode.

A reevaluation of his impact. If he realizes that the pain his departure would cause stems not from others’ weakness but from the strength of their bond, his fear of being a burden may transform. This is a difficult, adult acceptance: that causing pain by leaving is not selfishness, but evidence that you have become irreplaceable.

Healing Scenarios for Yanagi: When Closeness Stops Threatening the System

A crisis of control that does not lead to collapse. If the system continues to function without her hypercontrol — and even shows care for her — her belief that “everything will fall apart without me” may crack. This grants her the right to delegate not only tasks, but emotional responsibility.

Receiving care that does not require her function. If others begin to support her not as deputy commander, but as a tired Yanagi — asking “What do you want?” instead of “What needs to be done?” — she can begin practicing desire without guilt.

Legitimizing simplicity. Her love of bad comedies and quiet pleasures is key. If her “imperfect” self receives external validation — if Harumasa says, “I like your terrible sense of humor; it’s real” — then imperfection becomes part of her wholeness, not a shameful secret.

When Does Romance Stop Being a Self-Destructive Risk?

When both processes converge.

Harumasa believes a little more in tomorrow and stops seeing himself as a delayed explosion in someone else’s heart.

Yanagi grows a little tired of perfection and discovers the world does not collapse — people only come closer.

Then confession becomes not a grenade in a shelter, but a quiet decision to add another room — for the parts of themselves they once hid.

Their romance would still not be “ordinary.” It would remain an extension of their existing agreement:

* Closeness as the expanded right to see one another — and to be seen as weak.
* The future as intention, not a ten-year plan: “I will try to be here, and you may ask me to stay.”
* Love as not a demand, but the highest form of their pact: “I recognize your absolute value and voluntarily choose to share my limited resources — time, strength, attention — because you are the reason those resources gain meaning.”

The least risky path is not sudden passion, but slow mutual rehabilitation. He learns to be present by watching her value his present. She learns to want by watching him respect her wants. Their old system is not destroyed, but expanded—an upper floor built not for survival, but for life.

# Conclusions and Author’s Reflections

Other scenarios are, of course, possible. But I believe that development through quiet rehabilitation rather than catastrophic suffering is the highest form of respect for characters who have already endured pain and built complex adaptive mechanisms. Breaking them through tragedy to force realization would be violence against their essence.

Healing through confirmation rather than destruction preserves the beauty and uniqueness of their bond. Throughout this analysis, I sought to uphold several principles:

* Not to invalidate their fears. Not “stop being afraid,” but “I see your fear; it has the right to exist—can we build something alongside it?”
* Not to destroy their compromises. They do not betray their shelter; they slowly make it more livable, letting in a little sunlight without tearing down the walls.
* To express their love through patience rather than confession. Through the willingness to wait while the other heals—and to remain nearby when that step is taken. This is the rarest form of care, one they already practice intuitively.

My ideal ending for them is not marriage or a declaration. It is a moment years later, when they realize they have long been living in that special form of relationship. When a tired Yanagi can say, “Harumasa, today’s meeting drained me,” and it is not a catastrophe. When Harumasa can say, “Yanagi, next month let’s go hang out in Lumina Square,” and it is neither a lie nor a burden.

It is a quiet victory—not over circumstances, but over the inner demons those circumstances created. A victory achieved not in battle, but through the daily courage to trust another person with a fragment of vulnerability—and to find it held with care.

I love these two, and I love their dynamic. And yet there is sadness in how their trauma makes them fear connection and weakness. Their strength lies precisely in that vulnerability. Their relationship is valuable not despite their trauma, but because of how they live with it. Simple romantic tropes would not suit them, because their story is about something deeper.

Even within their current dynamic, there is room for small, quiet moments of closeness that fit who they are. They do not change the essence of their bond, but they offer warmth to those who may need it after reading this analysis:

Late at night, after a long workday, Yanagi and Harumasa ride the subway, sharing music through a single pair of headphones connected to his cassette player. She rests her head on his shoulder; he leans lightly against her. The cassette was recorded by Harumasa specifically for the two of them.

On weekends, renting a tape, Yanagi and Harumasa sit under a blanket, sipping hot tea, watching ""Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No!"". Harumasa laughs loudly; Yanagi keeps smiling, snorting softly at the most ridiculous moments.

Yanagi has been working without a break for two hours. Harumasa, without interrupting or telling her to rest, quietly takes the cold coffee and replaces it with a fresh, hot, sweet one—just how she likes it. Ten minutes later, their eyes meet, and Yanagi mouths, “Thank you.”

On that note, I will end this analysis. I hope it was interesting to read and that I managed to offer something of value. Thank you for your attention

I took the loss hard though I had anticipatory grief her last month. We knew the end was coming. She told me the morning of and it was like it was in English. I picked her urn up and put it in my bag like it was my favorite coffee. Almost no tears. I went home and picked up some food.

  
The bouts of sobbing have come and go like heartburn but it was getting easier. I got photos of her and have an album coming in Monday to put them in. I collected her favorite toys and put them with a felted ball of her fur. 

I was doing better until I took her urn out of the bag it was in. It was like someone turned on a faucet. Seeing her name on the box is like I lost her all over again. I had 4 days to mourn her after she passed and have 3 now with a doctor note.

I’m not a religious person but feel like she helped me last night somehow. I fell off a ladder and landed on my feet. It bruised my heels but I had enough time to weigh my options while going down.

Thankfully, it has not progressed enough to need surgery. She's been in really bad pain and frequently falling when jumping and needing a lot of back-end support to get comfortable in my lap. (However, it hasn't *deterred* her from continuing to try jumping on everything despite falling and making it worse.) I am in regular contact with her vet, and she is now on pain meds to get things under control and will be on anti-inflammatory meds for maintenance. She is and has always been a healthy weight; she's not very food-motivated, so getting overweight isn't a concern at all.

**My question is how to now make any changes to my home to prevent her knees from getting really irritated and painful again.** I have her isolated in the bedroom while we get her feeling better (as she can only jump on the bed and nothing else in there), but that's not feasible long-term. Nothing will deter her from jumping onto the couch, the back of the armchair, the coffee table, or my desk. All of these she has recently fallen from, but getting four sets of pet stairs for the living room plus two more for each side of the bed feels excessive and like it would make things difficult for me to get around.

Has anyone dealt with their cat having trouble jumping, but insisting on trying anyway? How can I help make my home safer for her? Should I really just get six sets of stairs for her to get up on everything?

1qxrbb7,https://www.reddit.com/r/widowers/comments/1qxrbb7/dating_too_soon/,Dating too soon,"I realize I’m a total idiot. I lost my partner of 21 years in October, and ended up on a dating app a mere 10 days later. I set my settings to be looking for friend connections as I just really wanted to chat with people as a (dumb) distraction. My partner was male so I focused more on chatting with women (who I pretty much failed to connect with! I was never great with the ladies back in the day either).

My best (but somewhat toxic) friend thinks I’m an idiot and probably many other things she hasn’t expressed.  My next best (wholesome) friend has said I should do whatever I feel like doing. 

Well. I met two guys I clicked with on a friendship level. I realized the first guy started love bombing me so I backed away.

The second guy has been lovely. We had some coffees and there was significant chemistry. We had some dates and I ultimately slept with him more than a few times over the month of January. 

I hadn’t had sex in ten years due to my partner’s declining health. He used to tell me I should find a boy or girlfriend while he was still alive, which I of course refused to accept (wth!). I think he felt guilty for my lack of sex from 31 to 41 which is why he kept offering to “open” the relationship.

I guess the problem is that I like this guy, like, a lot. He likes me. We agreed we wouldn’t be seeing anyone else, but I’m definitely not ready to be called someone’s “girlfriend”. I was someone’s girlfriend, and that was my partner.

I’m curious if anyone else has been as dumb as I have and dated so soon after their partner passed? I definitely was pre grieving for years but I can’t imagine outside observers would be okay with my speed.",5,1770406061.0,widowers,4,1.0,False

1qxr7pg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxr7pg,Trip report - 1 month in Georgia and I LOVED it,"Currently on a gap year so I went in Georgia and stayed for 1 month, I really loved the country and will return for sure. I'm also doing this post to motivate more people to visit this lovely part of the world

Even with all that time I couldn't visit everything but here is my itinerary

\-- ITINERARY --

Arrived from Bulgaria by boat (3 days travel) -> Batumi -> Kutaissi -> Gori (+Uplistsikhe) -> Tbilissi (+Ananuri + Davit Gareja) -> Kazbegi (or Stephantsminda) -> Telavi -> Sighnaghi -> Akhaltsikhe (+Vardzia) -> Turkey through Kars

\-Batumi: very modern and resort city, 2nd biggest in the country  
\-Kutaissi: 3rd biggest city, very nice cathedral and nearby nature has some nice spots to visit  
\-Gori: Stalin's native city, the only place where communism symbols are allowed. You can visit the Stalin Museum and troglodyte city of Uplistsikhe  
\-Tbilissi: Big capital city, everything is here, so many things to do and visit nearby  
\-Kazbegi: Montain region near Russia, magical place, also the most visited.  
\-Telavi: city in the wine region, I really liked it even if there's not tons of things to visit, near the   
lovely village of Sighnaghi  
\-Akhaltsikhe: city in the south, near Turkey. Huge castle to visit as well as the wonderfull troglodyte city of Vardzia.

Not visited but worth a look too -> Svaneti region, Samegrelo park, Tusheti region, Mtirala park

\-- GOING AROUND --  
  
Everything is doable without a rented car  
Main transportation is by marshrutkas (minibuses), not the top comfort but very affordable and used by the locals. Barely no information on internet so better check at the bus station. Back in the time they tend to leave only when they are full, but nowadays they more and more stick to the planning. If you don't know which minibus to take, ask pretty much anyone at the station they will help you.  
Also pay directly the driver, he will either take the money and tell you who to pay the ticket to, so you will avoid the very rare scams  
Trains are only between main cities but are comfortable and affordable - book couple days in advance!

\-- LANGUAGE --

Georgian is the main language, russian is widely used, english is very rare for any 30+ local outside of tbilissi.  
Google trad will do the job but I had a lot of fun learning georgian alphabet and sentences, you can give a try and they will be super happy to hear some words from you, I even got some chacha (local strong alcohol) offered in restaurants because I was able to order in georgian :)

To learn georgian I ran into a youtube channel ""Ryan nakao"" it was very helpful if you are willing to learn the basics and pronunciation, you can train with locals too they love to teach georgian

\-- OTHER SMALL TIPS & EXPERIENCES --

\-Georgians are among the most welcoming people, I would recommend guesthouses and hostels over regular hotel or airbnb. Even if the host isn't fluent in english, you will get coffee offered, a friendly chat, and the host never talk about paying the room (doesn't mean it's free, but you have to bring the topic), you really feel like a guest as long as you show respect to both the host and the house. I even got invited to eat diner with the hosting family sometimes.

\- Stray dogs: there is a lot of them. But most are adorable. They will have a little plastic thing on the ear saying they are vaccinated. Green and yellow mean they are pretty calm, red means they can be aggressive sometimes. But never ran into a dangerous dog. Moreover I believe this color panel is only used in Tbilissi as other cities just put whatever color they find when vaccinating. However I wouldn't recommend to pet the dogs, even if they are friendly, because they might have tick or flea

\-You can easily hitchhike, sometimes I got picked up without even asking in some rural places. And they always declined when I tried to give a bit of money after the ride  
  
\-There are some taxi drivers near Stalin Museum in Gori grabbing tourists for uplistsikhe, avoid them as they are very expensive, the marshrutka for Uplistsikhe is less than 1€ (it was 2GEL) and not even 10min of walk from the museum  
  
\-If you go to Kazbegi from Tbilissi, the marshrutka station isn't the first one you'll see by leaving the metro station, walk a bit further and ask locals

\-Pictures in religious places are frowned upon, do it when the place it is empty and NEVER during the mass. Also Orthodox churches = women have to cover their hairs, but usually they give a cloth at the entrance if you don't have one

\-- TOP VS BOT MOMENT --

TOP -> Georgian people and food must be highlited, very welcoming and helpful if you need it, and the food is delicious, I still eat it when I find a georgian restaurant in my city.  
I really liked Kutaissi and Telavi which seemed pretty underated and very authentic cities from my POV.

BOT -> Batumi, I disliked the city as I felt like it was a caucasian Las Vegas full of rich russian tourists coming for casinos. Hopefully I will return and change my mind about batumi!

\-- SAFETY --

As a man, I felt super safe at every moment. Sometimes the marshrutka or hitchhike drivers might drive a bit wild.  
I met women solo travelling and from their pov it seemed pretty safe too  
There might be some aggresive dogs in rural areas, I only heard some of them in Kazbegi, but it was indicated on google maps that some aggresive dogs where here, otherwise never had a single issue with dogs  
Politics wise, 2 regions are independantists and are supported by russian armies on site. The situation is pretty stable but better to check before going how the situation is evolving. Also there were several demonstrations in Tbilissi against the governement accused of being pro-russian, obviously as a tourist you should stay away from demonstrations  
But overall the country is super safe and welcoming  


That's it for the overall feedback, you should definitly give a try to Georgia before it becomes to crowded with tourists. Show interest in their history and language and you will feel like a guest here",405,1770405843.0,travel,36,0.99,False

But it's so frustrating how much I have to hand-hold! 

They'll be put on reception to see what sort of clients we get using our service, and to understand how we process clients who come to us for help. I'm meant to look after them and I admit I'm not the best person for them to be placed with, not least of all as I work the busiest shift so can't always be the nice friendly trainer they might want me to be, but they just don't engage with anyone. 

You'd think someone who's almost an adult would at least know how to make a cup of coffee, but even that seems too much for half of them. Today a volunteer asked me where the coffee was: huge tub of coffee right in front of them as part of the coffee making setup.l, could not have been any easier to spot. They later said the kettle was empty...didn't occur to them to maybe go fill it with water again. Same volunteer also didn't know how to turn on a PC. 

They are also often so unwilling to talk to clients, they'll come work the reception with me but can't even find their voice to talk to a client - if I'm not at the desk at the time we end up with confused clients, they don't understand why the receptionist isn't even acknowledging them. I understand anxiety or social struggles but why go work in a public facing job if you A. can't talk to the public, and B. are unwilling to try. 

I've a volunteer who works with me on Saturdays, has done for months now. My coworkers have to come cover my breaks because she can't even be trusted to watch a quiet reception for half an hour - all she needs to do is ask clients to fill in a simple form, that's it, and it's not even a busy shift so chances are she'd not get a client walk through the door in that time. I'm still confused as to why she keeps coming back. 

'm not the only one with this problem either, several coworkers have had the same experience with these young volunteers needing constant hand-holding to do even the simplest of tasks. 

Folk cannot keep blaming covid lockdowns either. I went through covid too, on top of being unemployed for years and as someone who was severely Autistic - I've never understood this as an excuse, yes covid had an impact but it didn't stop kids using their brains.

I've used the same hardware since I was a 15 year old. Now I'm 21, coming up on 22 and I think it's finally time to get \*some\* new parts, like a CPU to keep up with the times until I can afford to buy a bigger, and better computer that can handle what I do.

While I am a Computer Science major, I'm not very knowledgeable as I should be on some things like bottlenecking. With that, and the age I built (and upgraded) this computer at, it has a horrible CPU bottleneck that I would like to rectify.

The current CPU that I have is a 9600KF Coffee Lake, i5 9th Generation on the 1151 LGA socket. I've seen posts on other forums and Reddit saying that it's not worth to buy the I9 of this generation, and I'm not sure if to listen to that advice, (since almost 7 years later, it's still $200\~ give or take) or go with something a little less powerful as to not choke my 2060.

I'll give my specs below to give an idea of what I'm running, and I would really appreciate any help that you guys could give.

Me: mid 30s, girlfriend. Have spent last 4 years traveling the world chasing surf on my time off. Would a life filled with nature, surfing, and intellectual stimulation/pursuits. Would like a child here soon-ish. I like quaint coffee shops and good food but am not a snob. Heavily scientifically minded. Big nature guy. Not so into big cities. Have well-paying job offers in both locations. 

San Diego: 
pros: warm water + weather. Ample surf. Near places of intellectual stimulation (UCSD grand rounds, public science talks, etc), lots of food and coffee. Channel Islands access with a short drive (know people with boat and plenty of free time). Decent amount of mountain biking and places with different flora/fauna diversity. Small friend scene there already. BAJA proximity—fckin love that place. 
Cons: congested (comparatively); have never lived in a city so a little worried about being packed in. Surf lineups packed. Less *immediate* access to nature—would require a drive. Houses on top of each other and suburbia is less appealing although arguably better for raising a kid (better schools, too)

 Santa Cruz: 
pros: Really good surf, lush forests with relatively immediate access to nature. Food/coffee scene is enough. Great mountain biking and flora/fauna diversity. Big Sur is an easy day trip. Easier access to mountains. Houses can be found *in* or surrounded by nature, which is amazing.
Cons: colder (water + air). Thicker wetsuits are not a deal breaker but just a lil bummer. Water viz/diving not as consistently great. No channel island or Baja access. Smallish town, kind of concerned I won’t be able to find an intellectually stimulating social scene but SJ and SF aren’t too far for the occasional outing. Probably not as great of schools for kids.

I realize they are very different but they both seem really great with relatively small drawbacks. I’m fortunate in that I don’t think either will be a wrong decision, but help me decide one!

1qxqyd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1qxqyd7/i_39m_recently_married_my_former_student_19tf/,I (39M) recently married my former student (19TF),"This account is going to be logged out from and ignored immediately after posting.

I was a high school english teacher in suburban Illinois for 14 years. Especially in my earlier years, I experienced a handful of female (and, in one case, male) students that have been very forward in their attraction to me. As I got older, I received less and less of this attention. I was perfectly fine with that, seeing as I had never once felt any reciprocal affection for a student. I was happily married to an incredible woman and I lived in a sizable townhouse, so why would I want anything else? 

And then I met Caroline (*pseudonym*). She was a great student that I had in my Advanced Creative Writing class. She was the one I’d seat next to slackers and the cut-ups to keep them on the right track. Within the first few weeks of class, she showed what a beautiful writer she was. She wrote about her own struggles, her joys, her fears, and her very impressive philosophies. Through her writing, I learned that she was transgender, having started her transition as a pre-teen. As a teacher, I would go around and either pretend to be invested in what they were writing about, or, in speaking to Caroline, ask genuine questions. She opened up and we had a very special conversation. I learned a lot about her, from her development of her physical appearance and style to her resilience through years of dysphoria and harassment. 

She started coming to my classroom during lunch, having eaten alone for a majority of her high school career. Spending more time together lead us to have even more of those deep conversations and they eventually got more real. Before I had the presence of mind to stop myself, I would be telling her about my childhood abuse and my marital problems. She would listen with the wisdom of a psychology professor, and provide verbal comfort that I didn’t get from anyone else.

She took my class again the following semester, and then she was a student tutor in my classroom during the entirety of her senior year. I didn’t feel any romantic attraction to her, but our relationship was definitely not appropriate. We were good friends, which shouldn’t be the case for a relationship between a student and a teacher. We’re encouraged to keep those cordial at most, for good reason. I want it to be clear that I took my job very seriously and never once behaved illegally or inappropriately while at my workplace. 

When Caroline was nearing graduation, she asked me to meet her for coffee at a local cafe a few towns over. To be completely honest, I had a gut feeling what the outcome of this meeting was going to be. And my fault lies in the fact that I went. There, she confessed her feelings for me. Her hands were shaking and she had tears in her eyes as she spoke. She had every right to be nervous, seeing as my career was on the line. I told her that I had an answer for her that I couldn’t give at the moment, and she understood what I meant. I wanted her to know that the feelings were mutual before I told her that we wouldn’t be speaking until after commencement. She went back to her usual lunch spot and tutored for a different class. To say that I missed her would be an understatement.

Three months later, last May, she graduated with honors and distinction. I attended the ceremony as I’d done each year prior, and was devastated to see that her family did not attend. I spoke to her after the ceremony and she told me that her mother had dropped her off, leaving her without a ride home. I offered to stop for dinner and drop her off back at home. I admit, the dinner was definitely a “date”, candles lit and all. It was a good time. We talked about her future over decently priced Italian food for a few hours. She offered to pay her half of the bill, but I insisted that it was my treat.

The car ride home was mostly quiet. She seemed contemplative and, again, very nervous. She kissed me goodbye and left me her phone number before exiting the car, which was a big step for her to make.

I didn’t call her until my divorce was finalized. I chose to separate from my then-wife because I felt like I was being unfair to both her and myself by being undeniably in love with Caroline.

Caroline and I moved out of state together shortly after, and got married this past September. I can say that, beyond a shadow of doubt, I have never been happier. She’s changed my life in ways that I didn’t know possible and I love her more than anything.

I guess I felt the need to confess to this because it *is* frowned upon, to say the least. When people find out about our relationship, they are immediately off-put or even angry, without hearing me out on the subject. I think telling a bunch of online strangers the whole story anonymously is a step towards guiltless living.

Gerald drives the 5:47am bus that I take to work every morning. He’s probably in his late 50s, always wearing the same baseball cap, always has jazz playing quietly in the background.

For two years, our interaction was the same. I’d get on, tap my card, he’d say “morning,” I’d nod, I’d sit down. That’s it.

Then three months ago, my mom died unexpectedly. I took two weeks off work. When I got back on that bus, I was a mess. Still in shock, barely sleeping, just going through the motions.

I tapped my card and Gerald said “morning” like always. I barely managed a nod.

The next day, same thing. But on the third day, as I was walking past him, he quietly said, “Glad you’re back. We missed you.”

Such a small thing. But I had to fight back tears the whole ride.

A week later, I got on the bus and there was a coffee cup in the little holder near the driver’s seat with my name on it. Gerald saw my confusion and said, “You look like you could use it. Black, right? I see you with the coffee shop cup most mornings.”

He’d remembered how I take my coffee. This man who drives hundreds of people and I’m just another passenger.

It became our thing. Every morning, there’d be a coffee waiting. We started chatting a bit. Never about anything heavy. Weather. Sports. His grandson’s little league games. Normal stuff.

Last week, I got a new job with better hours. My last day taking that early bus was Friday.

When I got on, there was the usual coffee, but also a paper bag. Inside was a pack of really nice coffee beans and a note: “For your new adventure. You’re gonna do great. Stay strong. - Gerald”

I tried to pay him for all the coffee, for the beans, for everything. He refused. Said, “Sometimes we all need someone to see us. I’m just glad I could be that person for a bit.”

I’m sitting at my new job right now, drinking coffee I made from those beans Gerald gave me.

I don’t know if he’ll ever understand what those small acts of kindness meant during the worst period of my life. How having one person acknowledge my existence every morning gave me a reason to keep showing up.

Gerald, if somehow you see this: You didn’t just drive a bus. You drove me through the darkest tunnel I’ve ever been in. Thank you for seeing me.

To everyone else: Be a Gerald. You never know when a small gesture might be the thing that keeps someone going.",1,1770405059.0,feelgoodstories2025,0,1.0,False

Context: Hunter Pace (the lovely fella pictured above) is a duelist my S/I admired when she lived in the Satellite slums and whom she dreamt of meeting some day; something Kalin was aware of and teased her about when they were teens. Nowadays, she participates in Tag Duels with said idol - now her best friend -, and decides to properly introduce him and her companion to each other. Hope you enjoy 🖤

___

Kalin, usually stoic and composed, shifted nervously beside Lola while she put the finishing touches on her assortment of crostini and rosemary focaccia. He knew about Hunter Pace, of course. Who didn't? The legendary *Phantom of Fire*, the *Mad Biker*, the former Turbo Duel world champion... and Lola's hero back when they were teens. And now, years later, he was about to meet the man who had become his lover's Tag Turbo Duel partner and close friend.

""Relax, love,"" Lola said, sensing his nervousness. ""He's just Hunter. A chill, Texan, card-slinging goofball.""

As if on cue, her apartment's doorbell rang and she opened the door to reveal a figure clad in leather. Hunter grinned, a flash of sharpened white teeth against tanned skin. ""Lola-belle! How's my favourite Turbo Duel partner?"" He swept her into a bear hug before picking up the six-pack of premium craft beer at his feet. ""Brought the good stuff,"" he told her before his eyes landed of her boyfriend.

""And you must be the infamous Kalin! I've heard so much about you. Pleased to meet ya, partner."" He offered a calloused hand that swallowed Kalin's in its' grip.

""Pleasure's all mine,"" Kalin managed, a flicker of… something passing across his face. Was that jealousy? Lola mentally face-palmed.

""Figured we could crack a few open and get to know each other,"" Hunter announced before turning to his friend, brandishing a beer.

Lola waved a hand dismissively as she headed to the counter. ""I'm good, thanks. No alcohol for me. I'll just fix myself a mocktail.""

Hunter's eyebrows shot up as he turned to Kalin with a sly smile. ""Y'all been busy? Why ain't she drinkin'? You knock her up, son?""

Kalin nearly spat out the beer he'd just started drinking, his face turning a shade of red that clashed spectacularly with his fair skin. ""Angel? Are you...?"" He looked at her, wide-eyed.

Lola groaned, burying her face in her hands. ""Oh, for the love of Ra. It's just that alcohol and my meds don't exactly mix, so... Piña colada virgin for me. And Hunter, *please* behave and use a filter once in a while."" She turned around and burst out laughing at Kalin's bewildered look, a far cry from his usual composure. ""You two are killing me.""

While Lola prepared fruit skewers for her drink, Hunter launched into a story about their first Tag Duel together, then went on about advice he'd given her regarding her feelings for Kalin, who was growing redder with each word.

""Y'know, before you two lovebirds got together, Lola-belle used to come to me for advice on what kinda flowers a gloomy fella like you would appreciate. 'Hunter, he's so brooding and mysterious and we haven't spoken in ages, how do I even talk to him?',"" Hunter mimicked Lola's voice, exaggerating her usual monotone voice. ""She was so smitten, boy!""

""Hey! You promised this would stay between us!"" She tossed a stray fruit skewer at him, which he caught with surprising agility, and sighed. ""Drink your beer and stop embarrassing me.""

Kalin, finally relaxing, chuckled. ""So, you went to the *Mad Biker* for advice about me? That's… unexpected."" The earlier tension had dissipated, replaced by amusement and a newfound appreciation for the quirky bond between the two Turbo duelists. It was clear that Hunter's laid-back charm was infectious, and more importantly, that his affection for Lola was purely platonic.

As he got up to help her bring the antipasti to the coffee table, Kalin leaned over and whispered in Lola's ear, ""He's actually pretty cool, you know.""

Lola gave him a quick kiss on the cheek and smiled, relieved. ""Told you so.""",7,1770404961.0,FictoHideout,1,1.0,False

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you.

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.

I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness. We got back together

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.

I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

I dont know what happened, it was all good. He even said even though he had longest relationship of 8 months with his ex. With me he had the smoothest non toxic relationship (5 months).

I am so confused and he seems so fine and moved on. He seem to be happy unbothered.

1qxqr96,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/fsn3.71374,Causal Effect of Dietary Patterns on Cerebral Small Vessel Disease: A Mendelian Randomization Study,"# ABSTRACT

While emerging observational evidence suggests associations between dietary factors and cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD), the causal nature of these relationships remains unestablished. This study employed a two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) framework to investigate genetically predicted causal effects of dietary patterns on neuroimaging markers of CSVD. We utilized Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS) summary statistics from European-ancestry cohorts for 32 dietary exposures and four CSVD phenotypes: white matter hyperintensities (WMH), lacunar strokes (LS), enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS), and brain microbleeds (BMB). Specifically, WMH volume, fractional anisotropy (FA), and mean diffusivity (MD) are indicators related to WMH. Genetic instruments (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) were rigorously selected using genome-wide significance thresholds (p < 5 × 10−8/p < 5 × 10−6), linkage disequilibrium clumping (r < 0.001), and pleiotropy exclusion criteria. The primary analysis employed inverse-variance weighted (IVW) MR, with validation through four complementary methods: weighted median, MR-Egger regression, weighted mode, and simple mode. Significant associations (p < 0.05) underwent false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Robustness was further assessed through heterogeneity testing (Cochran's Q), horizontal pleiotropy evaluation (MR-Egger intercept), and leave-one-out analysis. Simultaneously perform reverse MR analysis to eliminate reverse causal relationships. Our MR analysis revealed several genetically predicted causal associations between dietary factors and CSVD neuroimaging markers. Higher polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) levels demonstrated a protective effect against WMH volume (β = −0.070, 95% CI: −0.126 to −0.015; se = 0.028; p = 0.013, FDR-adjusted p = 0.033). Similarly, our analysis revealed a protective causal association between monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) intake and the risk of lobar BMB (β = −0.298, se = 0.115, 95% CI: −0.523 to −0.073; p = 0.009, FDR-adjusted p = 0.035). Conversely, increased iron intake exhibited detrimental effects on both any BMB (β = 0.247, se = 0.094, 95% CI: 0.064 to 0.430; p = 0.008, FDR-adjusted p = 0.041) and strictly deep BMB (β = 0.414, se = 0.153, 95% CI: 0.116 to 0.713; p = 0.007, FDR-adjusted p = 0.033). Notably, suggestive protective associations of coffee consumption (β = −0.088, se = 0.044, 95% CI: −0.173 to −0.002; p = 0.045, FDR-adjusted p = 0.225) and non-oily fish intake (β = −0.193, se = 0.098, 95% CI: −0.386 to −0.001; p = 0.049, FDR-adjusted p = 0.248) with basal ganglia PVS were observed; however, these associations did not survive multiple testing correction (FDR-adjusted p > 0.05). All significant findings showed no evidence of heterogeneity (PS\_heterogeneity > 0.05) or horizontal pleiotropy (PS\_pleiotropy > 0.05). Reverse MR analyses revealed no causal effects of CSVD features on dietary exposures (PS > 0.05). This study provides novel genetic evidence supporting heterogeneous causal effects of dietary patterns on distinct CSVD phenotypes. The protective effect of PUFA against white matter injury, together with the beneficial role of MUFA in brain microbleeds, contrasted with iron's detrimental impact on brain microbleeds, underscoring the pathophysiological complexity of diet-CSVD interactions. While nominally significant associations between coffee/fish intake and PVS require further validation, our findings emphasize the potential of targeted nutritional interventions in CSVD prevention. Future prospective studies with standardized dietary assessments and longitudinal neuroimaging are warranted to translate these genetic insights into clinical practice.

He thought he could hire 2 slaves in Mumbai also as buffer and get by - as of a month ago, my ex boss and his crony were both laud off from my ex company in a massive shakeup, and I messaged him on linkedin asking if he needs my help with a wink emoji. Another peer of mine who was also laid off with me by the same idiot was not so kind, he really sent him a taunting message on LinkedIn and showed me a screenshot which I enjoyed so much that I wanted to beat my meat to it. Some men are really talented at sending tirades without F words and still make it so powerful.

I spent 3 months in the doghouse and thanks to  Jesus Christ and my “novena to St. Jude for desperate situations” - on the 28th day of the novena, I got my offer. If you’re Catholic or Christian, pay attention. You need a little supernatural air cover also.

I want to help others adopt the tricks I used instead of jacking up your anxiety and talking to resume writers who in my NOT humble opinion are:

A. IDIOTS

B. Impostors (never held an office job, writing your word doc is their job)

C. Using the same trick I am going to give you but charge you 500 bucks or more

D. Beware of this business model - white woman runs the engagement (she is cute, blonde, nice but she is the front) - she is the honeypot - the outfit is run by the usual suspects (offshore English speaking Indians or Pakistanis) and they use their AI to write your resume. They even use API to autobot your resume and throw it at every posting.

Steps:

One. Get a prescription for office 365 with AI copilot

Two. Open MS word

Three. Lets say you are marketing manager for a an alcoholic beverages firm

Four. Give your prom

1. pt to copilot exactly

as follows: “Write an ATS friendly resume for a marketing manager in the alcoholic beverages industry with 10+ years of experience”

Five. Take the output and this is your ATS friendly style

Six. Bring your original resume that you wrote yourself.

Seven. Go to a coffee shop, get strong coffee, sit by a window and enjoy the scene and merge your words into the main resume in step 5. Remember this is the ATS friendly format.

You may be 100 years old with 70 years of experience, but remember that age bias is very very very real. So only write the resume for the past 10 to 15 years.

The moment you let them know your first job was when JFK died, you’re fucked.

Depending on the experience needed for the job posting, change the title to “professional with 10+ years of experience” or just “over 15 years”. You can say it verbally in the interview that you are as old as a vampire.

Eight. Dedicate yourself to the merging. It’s like writing a love letter to yourself. Do not let the copilot bullets stand as is - tweak each section to put your own words in between the sentences. Some bullets you can use from copilot as is. This means you can speak to it.

Nine. Put the degree at the end. Don’t hide the graduation year coz that makes people look for the year. If there is a number there the eye ignores it. But get the resume lengthy enough that they don’t go to the degree section.

Ten. Keep it under 4 pages. Three pages is ideal. Mine was two and a half long and my job is a management professional one step below the CFO - that is my boss reports to the CFO. This is my soft spot. I like staying close to the action so I can also be an independent consultant and stay close to my skill set.

Save 500 or 1000s of dollars. This will get you an interview and then it’s on you and your snake oil salesman capability.

1qxqq0t,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxqq0t,Made a simple 5-prompt evening reflection in cozy pixel art to help wind down the day. Anyone else struggle with consistency?,"I've always wanted to journal more consistently, but most days my brain is too fried for long entries, or it feels like a chore. Lately I've been experimenting with super short, no-pressure reflections just to close the day gently.

I turned it into this little pixel-art ""MindQuest"" flow (Stardew vibes because cozy games help me relax 😅). It's literally 5 steps, 2-5 minutes max:

1. How do I feel right now? → Just notice, no judging.
2. What went well today? → Even the smallest thing counts (coffee tasted good, didn't snap at anyone, etc.).
3. What drained my energy? → Awareness first, no fixing needed.
4. What am I grateful for? → One thing is plenty.
5. One word for today... and done.

I made these screens to make it feel comforting instead of clinical — like flipping through a little in-game journal.

It's been helping me actually do reflection daily without burnout, and the pixel aesthetic tricks my brain into enjoying it.

Sharing the images here — feel free to screenshot/save/print/use as a spread/prompt card/whatever works for you.

Does anyone else have a quick routine like this that keeps journaling sustainable? Or what makes it hard for you to stick with it? Would love to hear your go-tos or tweaks that make reflection easier ♡

If discretion is the concern, wouldn't a physician or even online delivery be a way better method than going through a shady contact like epstein who apparently writes down all his crimes?

The other thing people focus on is a doctor not willing to prescribe something to ""dose another person"". Like, can't he just say it's for himself and slip it in her coffee or drink? What could Jeffrey Epstein possibly have access to that a doctor wouldn't for ""secret dosing"" of STD medications? 

It all sounds so unbelievable. Gates was a known philanderer and his wife and him had an open relationship in the past. It makes no sense to secretly dose his wife with an ""anti biotic"" from Epstein rather than just tell her the truth. ",0,1770404610.0,TrueUnpopularOpinion,5,0.4,False

I'm planning to get a coffee machine for my wife, who loves coffee. And I don't drink coffee at all, so, I'm a little clueless as to what features matter most. Hoping to get some advice from this group on what coffee machines to get.  

**Details:**

Location: US

Preferred Drink Types: Latte (She Likes Caramel Macchiato from Starbucks), doesn't drink black coffee

Space: Small. We have a small kitchen, with not a lot of empty space, so cannot fit something too big

Drink Frequency: \~4-5 times a week (Although I've been pushing her to drink less because of her iron deficiency)

Ease of use: Convenience is preferred (i.e not a lot of manual work)

Existing Tools: We have the small coffee frother wand at home

1qxqah7,https://www.reddit.com/r/SolidMen/comments/1qxqah7/how_to_study_effectively_10_sciencebased_tips/,How to Study Effectively: 10 Science-Based Tips That Actually Work,"

Okay so I've been deep diving into study methods for like 6 months now. podcasts, research papers, books from actual cognitive scientists, not just random youtube study influencers. And honestly? Most of what we were taught about studying is complete bullshit.

I used to pull all-nighters, reread my notes 50 times, highlight everything in neon colors. Felt productive as hell. My grades? Painfully average. Turns out our brains don't work the way we think they do. The techniques that FEEL like studying often do jack shit for actual learning.

Here's what actually works according to science, not just some productivity guru's opinion:

Stop rereading your notes like a broken record

Rereading feels comfortable. It's why we do it. But neuroscientist Dr. Henry Roediger (the guy who literally studies memory for a living) proved it's one of the least effective methods. Your brain recognizes the words and tricks you into thinking you know the material. You don't.

Instead, close the book and try to recall everything you just learned. Sounds harder? That's the point. This is called ""retrieval practice"" and it's insanely powerful. Every time you force your brain to pull information from memory, you strengthen those neural pathways. It's like doing reps at the gym but for your brain.

The book ""[Make It Stick](https://amzn.in/d/06VhMHo7): The Science of Successful Learning"" by cognitive scientists Peter Brown, Henry Roediger, and Mark McDaniel completely changed how I approach learning. These guys spent decades researching how memory actually works. The book destroys every comfortable study myth you've been clinging to. Honestly one of those reads where you're like ""why the fuck did nobody teach me this in school?"" 

Embrace the struggle, your brain grows when it hurts

If studying feels easy, you're probably not learning much. Dr. Robert Bjork's concept of ""desirable difficulties"" shows that when your brain has to work harder to retrieve information, it creates stronger memories. 

Mix up your subjects in one session instead of blocking them. Study math, then history, then biology. Feels chaotic and uncomfortable. That's exactly why it works, your brain has to keep switching gears and actually process what makes each subject different.

Ash app is genuinely helpful for this if you're dealing with study anxiety or perfectionism that makes you avoid the hard stuff. It's like having a pocket therapist who calls out your avoidance patterns. Not sponsored, just actually useful for rewiring how you approach challenges.

Space that shit out, cramming is for people who hate themselves

The forgetting curve is real. Hermann Ebbinghaus proved this like 140 years ago and we're still ignoring it. You forget about 50% of new information within an hour, 70% within 24 hours if you don't review it.

Solution? Spaced repetition. Review material right before you're about to forget it. Day 1, day 3, day 7, day 21. Sounds annoying but it's literally how your brain is wired to remember long-term. 

Anki is the gold standard app for this. It's ugly as hell and has a learning curve but it uses algorithms based on actual memory research. Medical students swear by it. Or try Remnote if you want something prettier that combines note-taking with spaced repetition.

Test yourself constantly, even when you're not ready

Pre-testing (quizzing yourself BEFORE you've fully learned something) seems backwards but it primes your brain to notice and retain the right information when you actually study it. Dr. Kornell's research at UCLA showed this improves retention significantly.

Make practice tests your best friend. Don't wait until you ""feel ready."" That feeling is a lie your brain tells you. The Feynman technique works great here too, try explaining the concept to a 5 year old (or your dog, no judgment). If you can't, you don't actually understand it yet.

If you want to go deeper on learning science but don't have the energy to read through dense research papers or multiple books, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) might be worth checking out. It's an AI learning app built by Columbia grads that turns books like ""Make It Stick,"" neuroscience research, and expert insights into personalized audio podcasts. 

You can type in something specific like ""I'm a visual learner struggling with abstract concepts in physics"" and it'll build an adaptive learning plan with episodes customized to your depth preference, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are actually addictive, there's this smoky, sarcastic style that makes even dry material entertaining during commutes or gym sessions. Plus you can pause mid-episode to ask questions to the AI coach and get instant answers. Makes the science behind effective studying way more accessible and actually enjoyable.

Your study environment matters more than you think

Context-dependent memory is wild. Your brain associates information with WHERE you learned it. Study in the same spot every time? Your memory becomes dependent on those environmental cues.

Switch it up. Library today, coffee shop tomorrow, park the next day. Makes your memory more flexible and accessible regardless of where you need to recall it (like in an exam room that looks nothing like your bedroom).

Also, Cal Newport's ""Deep Work"" is essential reading here. He's a computer science professor who writes about focus and productivity without the toxic hustle culture BS. The book breaks down how to create environments and habits for intense concentration. Best book I've read on actually getting shit done.

Ditch the highlighter, it's a security blanket

Highlighting feels productive. It's colorful. It's satisfying. It does almost nothing for your learning. You're just moving your hand, not engaging your brain.

Instead, write questions in the margins. Summarize paragraphs in your own words. Create connections to stuff you already know. This is called ""elaborative interrogation"" and it forces active processing instead of passive recognition.

Sleep is non-negotiable, your brain literally needs it to learn

Dr. Matthew Walker (neuroscientist at UC Berkeley) has spent his career studying sleep and memory. His research shows that sleep is when your brain consolidates memories, moving them from short-term to long-term storage.

Study before bed, your brain processes that information during sleep. All-nighters? You're basically guaranteeing you'll forget most of what you crammed. Your hippocampus (memory center) gets zero chance to do its job.

Walker's book ""[Why We Sleep](https://amzn.in/d/011E7IQO)"" is genuinely terrifying in the best way. He explains exactly what sleep deprivation does to your brain, memory, health, everything. After reading it I stopped wearing sleep deprivation as some weird badge of honor. 

Interleave your practice problems

Don't do 20 algebra problems in a row, then 20 geometry problems. Mix them up. This is called interleaving and research by Doug Rohrer shows it dramatically improves your ability to identify WHICH technique to use for WHICH problem.

In real life (and exams), nobody tells you ""here are 10 quadratic equations."" You need to figure out what type of problem you're facing first. Interleaving trains that discrimination skill.

Teaching others is the ultimate learning hack

The protégé effect is legit. When you prepare to teach material to someone else, your brain organizes information differently. You identify gaps in your own understanding. You create clearer mental models.

Start a study group where everyone takes turns teaching concepts. Or post explanations on reddit, forums, wherever. You'll learn more from teaching one concept than reviewing it 10 times.

Stop multitasking, your brain physically cannot do it

Neuroscience is clear on this. You're not multitasking, you're task-switching. Every switch costs cognitive energy and time. Research shows it can take 23 minutes to fully refocus after a distraction.

Phone on airplane mode. Browser tabs closed. One task at a time. Use the Pomodoro method if you need structure, 25 minutes of pure focus, then a break. The app Forest gamifies this pretty well, you grow virtual trees when you don't touch your phone.

Look, studying effectively isn't about grinding harder. It's about working with how your brain actually functions instead of against it. Most of these techniques feel counterintuitive or uncomfortable at first because they require actual cognitive effort. That discomfort is the entire point.

Your brain is insanely capable of learning and retaining information when you give it what it needs. Not more time, better methods.",1,1770403834.0,SolidMen,0,1.0,False
1qxqa5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/work/comments/1qxqa5e/need_advice_on_staying_calm_when_i_must_work/,"Need advice on staying calm when I must work closely with incompetent, condescending, bossy coworker","This is going to be a little bit of a rant so I can feel better. The tldr is that I struggle to stay nonreactive when my coworker is condescending, constantly late to meetings, cannot use our software, and my manager is doing nothing. I've watched hours of YouTube videos on trying to stay nonreactive, but this is so crazy-making that I'm hoping someone can give me some direct and useful advice. TIA. 



I work in an office with a small team, and a relatively shy, introverted, and conflict averse supervisor. 

A couple of years ago, my office hired someone who had previously been a supervisor in our type of work. This new coworker has struggled with basic technology (our project tracking software, our databases, Excel, managing the windows on their desktop, etc.), but always blames the tech that we all use daily without issue. They ask me for help, or ask dumb questions of me, or just straight up tell me something is not functional or they weren't told or trained on something. They never admit fault. 

They run to get a coffee before some of our meetings, missing the first 5 to 10 minutes and then asks a bunch of questions to get caught up. Which wastes everyone's time. 

They talk down to me slowly in a condescending tone. They actually do this to a lot of our coworkers, but I have to work closely with them.

  
There is more, but it's less relevant. It's been absolutely crazy-making working with them on a daily basis. Other coworkers, my supervisor, and my supervisor's supervisor know they are like this and have experienced this on some level. But it feels like no one is doing anything about it. I'm so stressed and frustrated about having to work with this person. 

  
Do you have any advice to stay nonreactive or how to approach the situation? Nothing has felt ""big enough"" to take to HR based on our employee handbook. I have spoken to my manager about the situation in a few occasions but nothing has come from it. 

Thanks for your time.

Over two-dollar coffee, don't bother with 'sorry' 

Or tell me we had a good run

Don't offer a smoke for the road

Cause I won't want to stop at one

I will not kiss you goodbye

Even though God knows I want to

Cause addiction is fed, by each cigarette

A last kiss will not help me quit you

With nicotine patches, distractions and mantras

I'll hope willpower grows

Hope that tomorrow brings peace in the sorrow

And tells me what older me knows

That adrenaline rush, my face starts to flush, 

When I stare at the name on my phone

Don't surrender. Don't text her. 

Let memories fade in the smoke...

Chorus

1qxq6ep,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1qxq6ep/avoidant_fa/,Avoidant - FA,"I met a guy on app. For hookups. From the beginning, there was strong mutual attraction and sex was great. and later he asked me after 2 weeks if I would be open for something serious and I said yes.

we agreed we were both looking for something serious and monogamous. He asked me if i would be open to meet his parents someday. I told him, I am not out to my family and few straight friends, but I do have gay friends where I am fully out and would love him to be part of it. He said, he doesnt want to be part of my straight life but its ok with me to have two lives as long as i respect him. He was heading to.m back home in a month after we met, and he told me “i hope I dont loose you in the process of moving my place and going back home and i hope you will be patient  with me” I told him, I will wait for you as long as you give me a reason to wait for you, i dont want you to come back and say oh I dont feel the same anymore” then I dont want to waste my time. He said no, I am very much interested in you.

The first couple of months were intense but positive: frequent dates, weekly routine for 5 months amazing sexual chemistry, emotional openness, future-oriented conversations, and consistent effort from both sides. He often said things like we have so much “potential,” that I was “perfect for him, not just sexually bit our values matches, and that he wanted a long-term relationship. His parents marriage was a goal for him.

I asked him about his past relationships the first time he asked me out and From what he shared, his past relationships followed a similar pattern. He has dated people he felt strong attraction toward, but those relationships ended once deeper issues surfaced. In one case, he said he “fell out of love” after several months. In another, he ended things because he felt hidden or not fully chosen by his partner. He described having met “good guys” before but still feeling unsure.

Early on, we also had a very open conversation about expectations, communication, and past relationship insecurities. He said he appreciated the clarity and that it made him feel safe. Which he it took 6-7 months to get to this conversation in his past relationship.

Around month 3–4, things started to change. As the relationship became more emotionally real, he began expressing confusion about his feelings and whether he felt enough “spark” or attraction, even though his behavior (seeing each other regularly, initiating plans, sex, affection) largely stayed the same. He oscillated between wanting to keep trying and feeling overwhelmed.

I had to go back home as my mom was in hospital and this time, I asked him to be patient with me and he cried while I was leaving and he said yes I will wait.

When I came back after a week. He questioned the concern of me being closeted and He said he doesnt feel spark and butterflies. He broke up with me

I agreed to coming out to my parents in near future and assured him that I will not leave his side and I am serious about him. I even took a small step coming out to my roommate who is my very good friend to show my seriousness. We got back together

During this period, I became more anxious because of the inconsistency, while still trying to give space and be patient. He acknowledged he was confused, said something might be “wrong with him,” and that he wanted the relationship to work but didn’t know if he could give what I needed.

We broke up once, reconciled briefly, and then broke up again after about 5 months. During the final breakup, he said that although I was an “8/10” and a great partner, he felt life was too short not to look for a “10/10,” and that he wasn’t sure the attraction was enough long-term. He emphasized that I did nothing wrong.

After the breakup, he appeared calm and emotionally detached, returned to dating apps quickly, and blocked me there. When we met once for coffee. he was friendly and relaxed but firm that he didn’t want to continue. I, on the other hand, am struggling with a lot of grief, confusion, and hurt, especially around how someone could feel so certain after months of closeness.

There are much more details in this but this is the shortest I could write and try to fit major information. He was crying during these hard conversations and was seen overwhelmed and confused.

I tried my best to have soft and open communication and tried to show him we can work through and we can take things slow or the way he wants but he has to communicate rather end it.

I’m trying to understand whether this was mainly about attraction, emotional readiness, attachment differences, or something else — and how to make sense of the mismatch between how close the relationship felt and how decisively it ended.

I dont know what happened, it was all good. He even said even though he had longest relationship of 8 months with his ex. With me he had the smoothest non toxic relationship (5 months).

I am so confused and he seems so fine and moved on. He seem to be happy unbothered.

I went in expecting a generic 90s ""dad comedy,"" but what I got was an absolute mood. Forget the standard classics; if you want the actual blueprint for a chaotic, campy existence, this is it. It’s not just a movie—it’s an entire vibe that belongs in the ""Gay Interest"" section of every streaming service.


The ""Island Sleaze"" Aesthetic

Kurt Russell is doing the absolute most. He spends the entire film in dangerously short-shorts, unbuttoned linen shirts, and that single eye patch. He’s essentially one iced coffee away from being a Bushwick influencer. It’s ""Island Sleaze"" personified, and honestly? It’s a masterclass in accessorizing.

The ""Odd Couple"" thing

You’ve got Martin Short playing this high-strung, repressed suburban dad who is clearly one Mai Tai away from a total identity crisis. Then you have Ron—a man who lives on a boat and has zero concept of personal space—basically ""awakening"" him. If you told me this was based on a ""slow-burn fanfic"", I would believe you in a heartbeat.

The Boat as a Life Metaphor

The ""Wanderer"" (the name though 🤣) is a dilapidated, messy vessel that barely stays afloat despite the constant chaos. If that isn't a direct allegory for ""navigating your 20s"" while trying to be ""the fun friend,"" I don't know what is. We are all just leaky boats held together by vibes and prayer.

I'm thinking of doing a golf meetup tomorrow \[Saturday\], so l've preponed the plan since many people mentioned that weekdays are busy and requested a weekend meetup. The Tuesday plan remains intact-this is just an additional weekend get-together based on requests.

The plan stays the same: we'll first meet for snacks and chai at Irani Cafe, Koregaon Park, and then head to the club for golf. The meetup will be relaxed, scheduled in the afternoon.

There will be a small golf session with my coach, who will guide beginners through the basics, so even if you're new to golf, you'll get a fair idea of how the game is played. All golf-related charges will be borne by me. If you're an experienced golfer, we can spend time on the short game or at the driving range.

Please note that a proper golf dress code is mandatory, so do check online beforehand to see if you're comfortable with it.

Girls are most welcome to join us for both Irani cafe and golf; it's intended to be a friendly, safe, and chill meetup.

If you're interested, please DM me and preferred timing. If you're more comfortable with Tuesday instead, feel free to mention that as well-based on majority availability, plans can always be adjusted.",3,1770403404.0,punemeetup,2,1.0,False

A few days ago there was a thread asking **which keyboard people are using on the LG Wing**.  
I commented there that I was working on an addon for my own keyboard.

Later I noticed (kind of by coincidence) that the post got **more than 1500 views**, so I figured there’s clearly still interest in keeping this device alive.

Now it’s done.

I just launched **DJS Key: PC & Addon Keyboard**, an Android keyboard with a **premium addon called “Wing”**, made specifically for the LG Wing.

What makes it special (and why it exists):  
👉 It brings back **the same dual-screen typing functionality that the native LG Wing keyboard had** — something no other third-party keyboard was offering.

# How it works

With the *Wing addon* you can:

* Type on one screen while the keyboard appears **full-screen on the other**
* Use it from **either the main display or the small one**
* Avoid gaps, resizing issues, or accidental dismiss
* Enable / disable it **with a single tap** from the addons bar

In practice, it behaves like the native LG keyboard —  
but works reliably and doesn’t feel abandoned.

# About the addon

* One-time purchase
* Around **€1.5** (coffee price)
* No ads, no subscriptions

If you still use your LG Wing and don’t want to give up its best feature, this was built for you.

👉 Google Play:  
[https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.djs.keyboard](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.djs.keyboard)

I’ll gladly answer any questions here.

anyways what are your guy's thoughts on the recent julie x lana lore for valentine's day? i personally think it's a bit odd since julie was a nurse at the hospital lana was at and is in some kind of position of power over lana especially with how much trauma lana had experienced and is still experiencing, patient doctor relationships are relatively frowned upon.

these are two things from the wiki that particularly stood out to me. ""was a former interning nurse and worker at the ""Home of the Doves: Medical Center"". She had a very deep relationship with Lana,"" ""A new patient named Lana was admitted into the medical center on December 13th, 2012 (based on Lana's first journal entry) and she quickly got attached to her, becoming Lana's light in a dark time in her life""  which i find fairly weird and fairly inappropriate given that julie was a working nurse/intern and lana was a patient there. the wording of ""a deep relationship"" and ""quickly got attached"" personally seems odd when talking about a nurse and their patient. while lana was in the hospital julie would sneak thing to lana like sweets and flowers and given lana's poor mental health would probably make her more attached to julie

is this relationship meant to be toxic or like nonconformity ? lana couldn't have met someone at a coffee shop or have some kind of met cute thing to give her a break from all the lore dumping and everything

It disturbed me to the core and I asked him if he's still friends with that person. He said he's not. I'm not sure if he still is but my recent interaction with him left me contemplating the friendship on the whole. 

I met him on Wednesday and he showed me all the photos he took of a guy who frequents the cafe. I told him how messed up it is to actually do that. I called him out on his behaviour and also told him that its not okay for him to click photos of random guys and people on his phone without their consent.

Power Plant Coffee

7990 California 1

Moss Landing, CA

Tickets: NotLoudConcerts.com

On Feb. 13, at 7:00, the folks from Not Loud Concerts are presenting a concert for everyone who is a bit sick of Valentine’s Day at Power Plant Coffee in Moss Landing.

The concert will feature no romantic songs, no happy endings and nothing sappy. Instead, the show will be all about songs that take an unvarnished look at love. There will be blues songs where no one escapes unscathed, rock songs that don’t end with a kiss and even a bluegrass murder ballad or two. 

At the show the world travelling band Dirty Cello will rock their way through a one hour program with their signature high energy and irreverent style. With powerful singing and lightning fast instrumentals, the program will even include their relationship song, “I May Not Be Perfect, But I’m Pretty Damn Good.”

Not Loud Concerts focus on creating an experience that is casual and fun for both the musicians and the audience. The concerts are never too long, never too expensive and of course never too loud. Seating is limited so grab tickets early.

The concert starts at 7 pm and ends at 8 pm.

Doors open at 6:30 pm to grab some coffee.

But anyone who’s worked on real AI-based hardware knows how fragile these systems are.
A big reason is impedance mismatch.
We still build robots in silos:
one system to perceive
one system to reason
one controller to act
That separation kills physical intuition. A robot might run a massive model in the cloud, yet fail at something as simple as picking up a slightly tilted mug.
Vision-Language-Action (VLA) architectures try to close this gap by training perception, reasoning, and action together, instead of stitching them at runtime.
Curious how others here see VLA fitting into real-world robotics beyond demos and lab setups.

Every item that has a base model and several colour variants should be available as soon as you are given the option in Scrooges menu.

Basically any item you would find in the 'other' menus, except for miscellaneous items that are put there even though they fit a franchise (looking at you AGRABAH Palace Bench and Palace Pouf 👀). It doesn't take away any playability or any need for progression, but it gives beginners more options and opens more slots for the hundreds of other Disney related items that valley players wait forever for.

  
The same goes for clothes. Recoloured dresses, jeans, shirts/t-shirts, trainers, socks (why don't we get the ankle socks straight away like we do the thigh high and crew?), glasses, headwear, jackets, gloves, again any item that is not related to Disney or is found under 'other', let us use them at the start. Give valley players more options and customization, rather then limiting them to 2+ versions of the same basic item, just to have to buy a different colour, of the SAME thing, from the store and waisting clothing slots.

  
The store in Scrooges menu is already lacking, especially clothes, at the start. Give us the option to access them from the beginning, and save the slots in the actual store for the Disney items valley players actually want to buy",13,1770403099.0,DreamlightValley,14,0.84,False

also, my whole life i’ve had like textbook adhd in females. i started experiencing limerence in 6th grade and experienced that like 4 more times. i have had the most intense hyper-fixations on music artists or albums or sometimes a whole genre of music. i was good in school but couldn’t get myself to read at home or study. i just can’t believe this was missed. i’m trying not to feel like “i wish i got help sooner” bc at least i got help now and didn’t waste another 5 years hating myself.

Celine Hoodie
White hoodie hits that perfect balance. The drape is natural, no stiff retail feeling. Spilled coffee right after putting it on and wiped it clean. Zero stress.

Stone Island Zip-Up
Pink color is bolder than expected but works. Fabric feels technical but breathable. Water rolled right off during a light drizzle. Badge catches the light just right.

AJ4 Black Cat (KX/KZ)
Shoes were scuffed in the box but the build is solid. Leather has a nice depth to the black color. Laces are thick and durable. Perfect for night walks.

FOG Essentials Hoodie
Heavy fabric but broken in from day one. Fit sits right on the hips. Didn't ride up at all during the day. Hood stays in place.

Nike Ankle Socks
Quality is just okay—functional but unremarkable. Cushioning present, yet feels slightly cheap. Serves for gym runs.

G-Shock GA-110
Classic white G-Shock. Keeps time with a minor drift after a week—nothing major, but worth noting. Still tough as nails.

EA7 Tracksuit
Gold logo adds a nice touch without being flashy. Fabric feels premium and drapes well. Buttons line up perfectly. Great for travel.

AF1 Black (AF Batch)
Stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Classic AF1 sole cushioning. Toe box gives room but keeps shape. No creasing after full day wear.

Ensure the local dishes are included and group with activities and attractions, shops, etc. in those locations so the couple is not constantly ubering. This trip takes place over the weekend of the 4th of July*

This is what it spit back:

###AI Answer###

###MY view###

I am glad the person asked, because some of this is good and some of it is pure garbage. As a local, I can tweak the prompt and better train the LLM, but that is not my job.

If you are a foodie, here are my notes:

**Day 1**: 12South and WeHo can work, but let's adjust a bit. 

*Breakfast*: Proper Bagle could work, but foodies in Nashville would like recommend Buttermilk Ranch as the first option. Reprompting, I could not get it in until I prompted ""Foodies usually recommend Buttermilk Ranch"" with the normal ChatGTP smart ass ""I knew that and here is why""

The shopping portion is okay, but I would include Planet Cowboy for sure. If you like craft beer, you should also throw in Filling Station, as they have one of the best curated lists in Nashville. 

*Lunch*: Edley's? Okay, if you want a BBQ place on your list, it can work. And it does reduce Ubers. But a foodie would more likely push for reservations at Locust, as it is the hot ticket. And Trevor and crew do not disappoint. 

As for moving to WeHo, the galleries are nota  bad idea, but Nashville Craft Distillery died some time back, so not sure how you will get that tour in.. 

*Dinner*: As for the restaurant recommendations, Bastion works, but I might hit Aba or Pastis, as they are the new kids on the block. For a bit more reasonable and a great sunset, Mercado by Butchertown. Teh Sicilian Butcher is also new and hot, but a chain. I would much rather do Iggy's for Italian, with its rotating menu, but there is another Italian fusion restaurant on a later day, so let's wait for that.

*Nightcap*: Never Never is cool for a more local's experience, but GoodTimes is also a nice spot. 


**Day 2**: Germantown and fireworks >> Move to East Nashville and then downtown

My mind is screaming NOOOOOOOOOOOO! like Luke when he found out Darth Vader was his father, so I am going to move some things here.

*Breakfast*: Butcher & Bee is a small chain by Brian Weaver, but the whippped feta is fabulous so nice callout AI guy. Although I would switch this one up as the Brie French Toast at Sky Blue is chef's kiss. So, this is a toss up.

From here, I would walk down to Fatherland Market, possibly taking a quick looksee into the Russell Hotel (old church), so AI on point here. And, better Saturday than Sunday, as more things will be closed. 

*Lunch*: It's the freaking fourth of July guys, so there is only ONE answer for East Nashville this day. Drum roll please. That Nashville Hot Chicken Festival. Yes, I know this is not upscale foodie stuff, but what foodie goes to another city and does not try their native dishes. 

As for the rest, many of the recommendations are too far away from each other. I love Vinyl Tap, and it is a good option if you want something different - vinyl shop that has a well-curated and extensive tap list. 

*Dinner*: As for the recommendations, Lyra would bring in some International, as would Pelican and Pig. Bad Idea for Lao fusion would also be interesting. I would love to say Margot, but she will be out of business by the 4th of July. You could conceivably get a cocktail at Attaboy before heading down for the fireworks (leave some walking time as the rideshare will drop you off at Music City Center, per regulations that day). But hitting Lower Broad after the fireworks will give you that part of Nashville.

**Day 3**: I switch this over the Germantown

*Breakfast*: If you are in a diner mood, then Big Al's Deli. Small party? Sit at the counter, if you can. Otherwise, switch breakfast to Monells. 

I agree witht he victorian homes, Bicentennial Park, and the Farmer's Market. Unfortunately, the TN State Museum is shuttered on the Lord's Day. 

*Lunch*: This could be Monells if you already hit Big Al's, but there are some nice ethnic spots in the Farmer's Market, like Jamaicaway. But ...

I might get the trolley and visit Marathon Village (shopping, distillery tours, car museum (free)) and Centennial Park (the Parthenon) and maybe even Belmont Mansion for some history (The GIG is also here) before swinging back for dinner. 

*Dinner*: I finall agree 100 with the Rolf & Daughters recommendation. This is, by far, one of my faves and a Modern Italian fusion kind of spot. If it is cool enough outside (unlikely on July 4th), I would also sit on the porch. Another great option is Tailor, which is Indian Fusion. If you want to mix in some seafood, then Henrietta Reds or the Optimist. 

NOTE: Southern Grist is NOT in Germantown. Bearded Iris (Wiseacre) and Monday Night are, with Tailgate Germantown actually in North Capital by the baseball stadium.

*Nightcap*: As the fireworks are downtown, you are not likely to be here for a nightcap, but if you return Mother's Ruin for the happening bar and Frankie J for a more low key time with some Germantown locals (LGBTIA+ friendly, but a nice vibe for anyone)",0,1770402958.0,VisitingNashville,6,0.2,False

1qxpv77,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1qxpv77,"The Haul: Celine, DT, SI & The Rest","Got everything in and broke it all in over the weekend. Quick thoughts on each piece.

Celine Hoodie
White hoodie hits that perfect balance. The drape is natural, no stiff retail feeling. Spilled coffee right after putting it on and wiped it clean. Zero stress.

Denim Tears Pants
That ape head print has a subtle texture you need to see IRL. Wore them out and got the nod from someone who spotted the brand. Perfect fit, no loose threads.

Stone Island Zip-Up
Pink color is bolder than expected but works. Fabric feels technical but breathable. Water rolled right off during a light drizzle. Badge catches the light just right.

AJ4 Black Cat (KX/KZ)
Shoes were scuffed in the box but the build is solid. Leather has a nice depth to the black color. Laces are thick and durable. Perfect for night walks.

FOG Essentials Hoodie
Heavy fabric but broken in from day one. Fit sits right on the hips. Didn't ride up at all during the day. Hood stays in place.

Nike Ankle Socks
Quality is just okay—functional but unremarkable. Cushioning present, yet feels slightly cheap. Serves for gym runs.

G-Shock GA-110
Classic white G-Shock. Keeps time with a minor drift after a week—nothing major, but worth noting. Still tough as nails.

EA7 Tracksuit
Gold logo adds a nice touch without being flashy. Fabric feels premium and drapes well. Buttons line up perfectly. Great for travel.

AF1 Black (AF Batch)
Stiff at first but breaks in nicely. Classic AF1 sole cushioning. Toe box gives room but keeps shape. No creasing after full day wear.

Been noticing how often friends, coworkers, even students label themselves lazy when they’re actually burned out, indecisive, overwhelmed, or wired wrong by social media. It’s frustrating how much viral advice on TikTok and IG oversimplifies the problem, like “just grind harder” or “you don’t want it bad enough.” That’s not only false, it’s harmful.

This post is built from actual research, books, and expert-backed podcasts (not hustle bros yelling into ring lights). If motivation has felt like a mystery lately, read this. You're not broken. You're likely misinformed.

Here are 8 science-backed reasons you're unmotivated that have nothing to do with being lazy:

• **Your dopamine is hijacked**  
Most people are drowning in instant gratification loops. Doomscrolling, binge-watching, frequent notifications kill your reward system’s ability to build long-term drive. Dr. Andrew Huberman explains in his podcast that regular dopamine peaks from short-term pleasure (like IG or gaming for hours) reduce your baseline motivation. You stop feeling excited about effort-based rewards like studying, working out, or creating. Fix: reduce passive dopamine hits and make rewards follow effort.

• **You never learned how to break goals into actions**  
James Clear in *Atomic Habits* points out motivation dies when goals are vague. ""Get fit"" or ""be successful"" mean nothing to your brain. But “10 push-ups after my coffee” recruits behavior. You need systems, not intentions. Translate goals into specific, low-resistance actions.

• **You're not sleeping right**  
Lack of sleep kills motivation before the day starts. Even one night of poor sleep can reduce dopamine receptor sensitivity, making you feel sluggish and unfocused (source: *Journal of Neuroscience*, 2016). Most people think they're fine on 5–6 hours, but chronic sleep debt grows quietly.

• **You're stuck in perfectionism**  
Perfectionism isn’t high standards. It’s fear of starting. Dr. Brené Brown’s research shows many people avoid beginning tasks if they fear they won’t do them perfectly. So you procrastinate, feel guilty, and the cycle continues. True productivity isn’t flawless. It’s consistent.

• **You’re not around motivating people**  
Behavior is social. Peer environment shifts your baseline. A study from *Harvard Business School* (2015) showed that even being in proximity to high performers increases motivation. If no one around you values progress, it’s hard to sustain your own.

• **You feel overwhelmed, not unmotivated**  
Sometimes the brain shuts down when a task feels too big. Dr. Barbara Oakley’s learning research calls this mental “diffusion mode”—you need rest or to mentally shelve tasks before focus returns. Start tiny. Clean your desk before writing a paper. Walk 5 minutes before a run.

• **Your self-talk is toxic**  
Telling yourself you’re lazy becomes a self-fulfilling loop. *Stanford psychologist Carol Dweck* found that students who internalize failure as identity (“I’m lazy”) give up faster than those who see failure as situational (“I didn’t sleep well”). What you say to yourself matters. Detach identity from performance.

• **You’re not experiencing progress**  
Progress releases dopamine. But if you’re constantly shifting focus or never tracking your wins, your brain never feels the payoff. Cal Newport explains in *Deep Work* that people need to see tangible signs of work to feel motivated. Try daily tracking. Checklists. Journal entries. Anything that shows forward movement.

You’re not lazy. You’re human. And the modern world is designed to steal your drive. But the good news is, most of this is fixable. Step one: recognize the real reasons. Then adjust—gently, consistently.",1,1770402792.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False

1qxppok,https://www.reddit.com/r/EcommerceWebsite/comments/1qxppok/spent_9_months_launching_saturated_products/,spent 9 months launching saturated products finally learned how to catch them before everyone else does,"Honestly the last nine months have been kind of a blur. Got totally absorbed in dropshipping. Scrolling through product channels before my coffee, checking what was trending during every break, going to bed thinking about why everything I tested already seemed picked over. Basically consumed everything.

Why stay so committed? I was dead certain that finding products early was the only real edge. Catch something before the flood and you're actually positioned to win. Real profit margins, consistent volume, building something that doesn't immediately race to the bottom. The entire business model lives or dies on whether you spot opportunities before they're obvious to everyone.

Here's what almost destroyed my motivation: I kept launching products nonstop, using every research method I could find, getting almost zero traction. I'd invest in what looked promising and move like 8-10 units before hitting a wall. Everyone said I needed to pick better. But literally every pick already had active sellers everywhere. Nothing felt undiscovered. Everything seemed already claimed.

I genuinely thought you needed premium research subscriptions or some network I didn't have access to for catching products at the right timing.

Then something clicked for me. The real problem wasn't that opportunities don't exist. I couldn't distinguish between what was building momentum versus what already peaked. Just selecting based on what looked good or copying what I saw working for others - which by nature meant arriving late.

So I ditched the random selection and started studying what actually happens before products explode. Went through 50 products that blew up, traced their trajectory back to the beginning, same exact patterns kept appearing 2-3 weeks before mainstream attention hit:

**Video performance indicators surface before product-level data shows anything meaningful.** I was watching sales volume and trending rankings on marketplaces, but all that lags significantly. By the time those signals look good, you've already missed the window. The actual early warning is when videos about a product start showing unusual traction while the product itself stays relatively unknown. That span between video momentum and mass awareness is where real opportunity exists - usually 2-3 weeks before everyone notices.

**Specific retention and engagement patterns predict which trends actually convert to sales.** Viral views don't automatically translate to revenue. Products that sustained growth long-term had videos showing particular engagement signatures - rewatch rates consistently over 25%, viewers staying engaged past 11 seconds, smooth retention without major drop points. Products with big viral spikes but poor retention characteristics? They'd pop briefly then disappear. The engagement data essentially forecasted which trends carried actual buying intent versus just passive viewing.

**The gap between early detection and complete market saturation is shockingly narrow.** From when those initial video signals start appearing to when the market floods with sellers is roughly 3 weeks, occasionally 4. I was finding products around week 2.5 when the first wave already established positioning. Identifying them during week 1, ahead of that initial wave, fundamentally transforms your competitive position and profit opportunity.

**Mainstream product recommendation sources essentially distribute opportunities that already matured.** Those aggregated lists, research platforms, community channels - they're compiling what recently succeeded. By the time something gets featured, you're entering alongside hundreds of others who saw identical recommendations. The edge is in accessing the underlying data before these sources identify the pattern and publish it.

**Approaches that work for early entrants usually stop working when the crowd replicates them.** I'd see a product crushing it with a particular positioning angle, copy that angle pretty closely, and get nothing. The early people found something specific that resonated. By the time I reproduced it, the market was saturated with that exact messaging. Being early means having room to experiment with different approaches while there's still space to differentiate.

The real shift wasn't doing more research or testing more products. It was building the ability to spot momentum before it became consensus knowledge. Found [this app](https://taap.it/pMTI4vm) which analyzes video engagement patterns to identify products in early growth stages - well before they surface in standard product research channels. It highlights products where engagement metrics are climbing and viewer behavior looks strong, but widespread awareness hasn't materialized yet. Conventional research shows you what's currently hot, this catches them weeks earlier while the window's still open. Changed my entire trajectory. Went from 5-6 weekly sales on crowded products to consistent 43-48 daily orders on items I caught in their early curve.

If every product you test feels like the market's already established by launch time, your discovery mechanism is probably the constraint. You're systematically finding things after their prime entry window closed.

Sharing this because I burned nine months consistently launching into competitive markets before understanding the timing component. Would've saved a ton of frustration if someone had shown me how to identify growth-phase products instead of already-established ones.

1qxpo74,https://www.reddit.com/r/Entrepreneurs/comments/1qxpo74/unpopular_opinion_i_charge_5_for_my_code_instead/,Unpopular Opinion: I charge $5 for my code instead of Open Sourcing it.,"I created a production-ready RAG starter kit (Next.js + Puppeteer + Pinecone). Advice from the usual suspects is: ""open source it to get stars, and then sell a hosted version.""

I did the opposite, kept the repo private, and I charge \~$5 for access. Why?

* Filter: Those who pay $5 are serious builders. Those who star a GitHub repo rarely deploy it.
* Support: Because they've paid - even the price of a coffee - I feel duty-bound actually to support them by email when they encounter a bug.
* Sustainability: That small stream of revenue made me want to keep updating it-just added multi-user namespaces.

Result? 10+ sales over the last several weeks and much more quality feedback than my free open source work.

*Has anyone else done the ""Paid Source-Available"" model for boilerplates? Or am I capping my growth by not giving it away free?*",1,1770402504.0,Entrepreneurs,2,0.67,False
