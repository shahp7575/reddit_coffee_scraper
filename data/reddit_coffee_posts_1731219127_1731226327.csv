1gnvx6l,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gnvx6l/best_friends_thc_cart_addiction_has_been_driving/,Best friend’s THC cart addiction has been driving me insane,"my best friend 18F and me 18F have been friends for about five years now. we're in our sixth form <early college program is the best way i could describe it for anyone outside of the UK> and she is actually driving me insane. she has very bad anxiety and became addicted to using the carts to cope, however, she is still living with her parents who found her items and grounded her for months. her parents blamed me ‹unfounded>, and it got to a point where i nearly wasn't allowed to see her anymore. i begged her to quit smoking even though i still do because my friend does not have control over her emotions and is generally severely addicted, not to mention the impacts on our friendship due to her parents' perception of me and me as an individual as I don't exactly have the greatest home life and it caused them to view me in a different light which sort of took that escape away from me. she can't function without those 
pens. whenever they get taken away from her she cries for DAYS and tells everybody she's suicidal, despite being noticeably healthier the day prior. the second she gets a new one she goes back to being fine. it's gotten so bad to the point her mom has considered sending her to a rehab facility. my concern is, i feel shes being manipulative. she does have mental health issues but they present MUCH lighter when she has her THC carts and the second she doesn't have them she tells everybody she's suicidal, specifically me, to get me to buy them for her despite me begging her to quit because of the situation with her parents and the fact i want her to actually manage her mental health. she sees a psychiatrist, takes medication, and goes to therapy: but she tells me none of those things matter and refuses to even do basic self care routines, eat better, or develop hobbies because none of it will matter to her if she doesnt have her THC carts. she got caught with the last one she had on my birthday and I haven't bought her any carts, so shes been deprived of them for a couple months. she has become completely unrecognizable. she used to be the happiest, most upbeat person i know. but lately she has been so nasty and mean spirited, being EXTREMELY negative even in situations that dont involve her, inviting me over to her house and then being silent the entire time and glaring at me every time i try to say something. i tried to talk to her about how it was making me feel and saw her in the school bathrooms a few moments later and she texted me saying ""i went into the bathroom to cry but it's okay
'... like what? she repeatedly texts me about how she wants to unalive herself over small inconveniences and it upsets me because her parents have done everything in their power to get her
help, i have major depression as well as a few other mental disorders so i understand what it is like to manage and i consistently give her advice. and she just refuses to take any of it because she thinks nothing will be as good as the weed. its particularly upsetting to me because my last best friend did actually commit in 2022 and she knows about that and how sensitive of a topic it is for me, but i feel she tells me these things without wanting to hear me out and honestly i feel like its just her trying to get everyone to cave and for me to buy her stuff because i have a job and she doesn't. i'm so tired of it. she's started judging me based on whose parents have the most money, doing things like comparing the prices of our coffee makers, calling my neighborhood 'ghetto', etc. im so tired of it and im actually ready to end our friendship over it. she wants to go to uni in america and her parents are offering to pay the entire thing but she's irritated with them because her parents want to visit regularly and if they go into her dorm and smell drugs they've told her they won't pay for it. which i honestly think is understandable, shes told me repeatedly that she wants to ignore her grades in college and ""drink and smoke until she fucking dies."" im so frustrated with her. ive done
everything to try and help her but she won't listen to me and its heartbreaking watching her go through this but I'm just so, so tired of it. it's taking the biggest toll on me mentally. ive had multiple conversations with her where she's told me she knows she's being selfish but she just doesn't care. i'm generally ready to just end our friendship, but it would be so awful for me because i love her so much and i just want to see her get better. but it doesn't look like that's going to be happening, so I don't know what to do. its especially annoying because she's specifically addicted to the cartridges which have been shown to have a much more negative impact on health rather than just smoking flower, and she goes through a 2g (equivalent to a 2000 mg edible) cart in about a week. shes noticeably less.. bright as well, subjects that used to be so easy for her have become hard. i dont know whether to distance myself from her or what",1,1731226268.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1gnvv6s,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1gnvv6s/does_my_boss_have_crush_on_me/,Does my boss have crush on me? ,"I have just stared my dream job in amazing team. My boss made good impression on me since the job interview, because besides being a good looking person he has a very nice, and charming personality. With time we found out that we have the same interests, reading the same books, magazines and even listing the same podcasts. Automatically, it leads to many conversations as we are both quite clever. I do really enjoy working with him, and he too, as he told me that one day. 

However, some attitudes of him started to concern me. First and foremost, after few months of working I have already received pretty heavy tasks, which requiring a lot of responsibilities. Moreover, my boss is happy with whatever I am doing, and compliment me one on one or in front of the team that sometimes I am feeling a little bit ashamed/uncomfortable. Of course, he is married! 

Very often, when we talk about work-related issues, he ends by asking about our common interests - whether I've already received a subscription to our favourite magazine in the post, or whether I've already started watching the games of our favourite team. In the past, when he came to work with the dog, he invited me several times to his room (when he was alone) to come and play with the dog or to get a coffee if I wanted to. These kinds of suggestions are not made in front of other members of the team. Recently, when we were on our way back together and with another colleague from a business trip, for example, he asked me what system I had for marking quotes in a book. 

I like this type of relationship, but I'm afraid people might start gossiping. I'm good at what I do and I'm glad I've been given more assignments in a short space of time, but I'm afraid that as a young woman I might be wrongly labelled later.  ",1,1731226018.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Swansea Christmas Parade + Waterfront Winterland Opens! 🎄🎡  
Plus 37 Things to Do: Wine Tasting, Planetarium, Dad's Army, Live Comedy, Murder Mystery  
  
  
Good morning, Swansea! This is the Swansea Scoop. The local newsletter that’s like getting a wave from Santa on his float!  
  
Christmas officially kicks off in Swansea this week, with the annual parade through the city centre. New for this year will be a sleigh carved entirely from ice!  
  
In this week’s Swansea Scoop:  
  
Winter Wine Tasting! 🍷  
Solve Along Murder She Wrote! 🕵️‍♀️  
Inflatable Planetarium! 🔭  
Waterfront Winterland! 🎡  
… and more!  
  
Let’s get to it.  
  
— Andrew  
  
P.S. We passed 3,000 subscribers this week! A big hello if this is your first edition of the Swansea Scoop, and thanks for joining us!  
  
  
IN PARTNERSHIP WITH HITS RADIO SOUTH WALES  
  
Help South Wales Families in Need This Christmas  
Last week, I was lucky enough to be invited to the offices of Hits Radio South Wales, along with several other Swansea businesses.  
  
I met Breakfast Show hosts Leigh and Claire and snagged a souvenir selfie in the studio (while resisting the temptation to press any buttons!), but the main reason I was there was to learn about Mission Christmas, an annual campaign run by Bauer Media’s Cash for Kids charity.  
  
Many families in South Wales live in poverty. They can’t afford to put food on the table or heat their homes, let alone think about buying Christmas presents for their children.  
  
The aim of Mission Christmas is simple: to ensure that every child (from age 0-18 years old) in South Wales wakes up to presents on Christmas Day.  
  
In 2023, it worked with schools, social services, children’s charities and community groups in the region to deliver gifts from Santa to 1,865 children.  
  
Mission Christmas launches on Monday, November 18th🎄  
  
How You Can Help  
If you are able to support Mission Christmas, here are a few ways you can help:  
  
Buy a gift and drop it off at any B&M store in South Wales.  
  
Choose a gift from Mission Christmas’ hand-picked Amazon Wishlist.  
Donate a cash amount online.  
Apply for a fundraising pack for your workplace, school, or nursery.  
Cash for Kids guarantees that a minimum of 80p in every pound donated goes towards helping those in need.  
  
Being involved with Mission Christmas reminds my wife and me how fortunate we are to afford gifts for our children at Christmas, and to see the joy it brings - something we may take for granted, but know is out of reach for many.  
  
Andrew.

✝️ Remembrance Sunday: There are many events to remember and honour all who defend our freedom next Sunday, including a service at the Cenotaph at 10.30 AM for 11 AM, followed by a Remembrance Parade on Oxford Street at 2 PM for 3 PM.  
  
☕ Da Coffi Opens: The refurbished Palace Theatre opened its doors this week. There’s co-working spaces upstairs, but on the ground floor you’ll find Da Coffi - open to the public. It’s a large, airy coffee shop decorated with paintings of scenes from Swansea’s history. We chatted with the owner, Nd, who’s only been in Swansea for a short while, so get down and support him if you can. It’s a welcome new spot to relax before catching a train or to sit and catch up on some work. Open Mon-Fri, 8 AM - 4 PM.  
  
🚚 Bin Collection Changes: Swansea Council has announced that starting December 2nd, black bags will be collected on ""green"" weeks and garden waste on ""pink"" weeks. There will be no garden waste collection from December 2 to February 28.  
  
🍺 City Centre Pub Sale: Morgans Hotel Group has acquired Swansea's historic Queens Hotel. Its new owners promise to preserve the pub’s unique charm and longstanding team.

WHAT’S ON

🎅 Swansea Christmas Parade  
It’s that special time of year again. The night when grown-ups huddle behind hoards of excited children gazing in wonder at the sight of a light-up Minecraft sword or brightly flashing princess wand - both costing a week’s wages and broken by the time you get home.  
  
Better still, spin them around to watch the kind of spectacular Christmas parade that Swansea has become known for - featuring singers, dancers, bands, choirs, floats, superheroes, local community groups, and more - plus, of course, the Big Man himself, who will stop to turn on the Christmas tree lights at Castle Gardens and on the Kingsway.  
  
The parade starts on Sunday November 17th at 5 PM at the bottom of Princess Way, before heading up to Castle Gardens, along High Street, down Orchard Street, and all the way to the end of The Kingsway, with an anticipated finish time of 6.30 PM.  
  
You’ll need to get to town early to secure a curbside spot almost anywhere along the route (although it’s normally a bit quieter towards the end of The Kingsway).

🎡 Waterfront Winterland Opens

The Giant Wheel at Mumbles Pier has been dismantled and reassembled outside the National Waterfront Museum, which can only mean one thing - Swansea Waterfront Winterland is back for 2024!  
  
As well as the wheel, there’s the return of the undercover ice rink (booking required, prices vary depending on date and time), Alpine Bar, and a whole host of funfair rides.  
  
The Waterfront Wonderland opens on Friday November 15th and will be open until January 4th, 2025.  
  
BOOK AHEAD: BREAKFAST WITH SANTA  


Not content with millions of mince pies, cookies, and glasses of sherry on Christmas Eve, Santa wants in on your breakfast, too. I’ve compiled all the places he’ll be popping up around Swansea to say hello and offer an early gift for the kids while you all tuck into a full English.

1gnvq25,https://www.reddit.com/r/ATEEZ/comments/1gnvq25/ateez_x_honkai_star_rail/,Ateez x Honkai Star Rail,"I am a massive nerd as well as a massive Atiny and I have speculated about which video game characters or which anime characters each of the boys can be. I’ve been playing a lot of Honkai Star Rail recently and for those who don’t know, Honkai Star Rail(HSR for short) is a turn based gatcha game made by the same company who made Genshin Impact. You take on the role of the Trailblazer who joins a group of travelers called the Nameless who travel on a space train called the Astral Express to help the many worlds in the universe. So far, the game has three worlds: Jarilo VI, The Xianzhou Alliance, and Penacony, the most recent world. Penacony is a planet where travelers go to enter a dream world and experience wonders and guess what the name the main area is called?

Golden Hour.

So with that tiny connection, I started to brainstorm which characters the Ateez boys could be and these are the results. 

Hongjoong: Jing Yuan

Jing Yuan is the general of the main ship we visit on the Xianzhou Alliance, the Xianzhou Luofu. He is extremely powerful, capable of commanding a lighting spirit to do damage in combat. In the story, he is clever and cocky, but he can back up his talk. The fandom has called him King Yuan because of his actions in the main story. He is a capable leader, just like our Captain, and he commands the Luofu with strategy and pride.

Seonghwa: Himeko

Himeko is the navigator of the Astral Express and a close ally of the protagonist. She is a motherly figure who takes care of the crew and loves them dearly, but she can also eradicate people with an orbital strike while sipping on her coffee(yes she does this in game). Himeko fits Seonghwa’s kind and protective persona well. Plus, they’re both really pretty.


Yunho: Luka

Luka is a boxer from a part of Jarilo VI called the Underground, a steampunk slum area beneath the vibrant city of Belobog. He has a mechanical arm and an indomitable fighting spirit. A recent event had Luka travel to the Luofu to participate in a fighting tournament to represent Jarilo VI and his perseverance and kindness helped him win. Luka fits with Yunho well because of his desire to help others and his kind heart.

Yeosang: Dr.Ratio(yes people have memed this name)

Dr. Veritas Ratio is a genius from the Intelligencia Guild, a group of people who desire to discover and share knowledge with the universe. He wears a statue mask sometimes during class and has a bit of a sassy personality combined with a caring heart. His attack in the game is literally him yeeting chalk at the enemy while saying that they failed. Yeosang has been called a statue because of his beauty and his brand of sassy humor has made me laugh on multiple occasions, so Dr.Ratio fits him well.


San: Argenti

Argenti is a Knight of Beauty, followers of the god of beauty who fight to defend beauty across the cosmos.He is gentleman to the core and all of his interactions with the protagonist are really sweet and really funny. San is a walking green forest and someone who has earned the title of gentleman, so this knight of beauty suits him well. 


Mingi: Boothill

Boothill is a cowboy cyborg who is a member of the Galaxy Rangers, hunters that travel the cosmos defending justice and pursuing their own personal prey. He is goofy as hell who casually eats bullets, but he’s also one of the best damage dealers in the game. A funny piece of lore, every character in the game has a universal translator with them, but someone messed with Boothill’s translator so his swear words are censored. That’s how we get such gems such as muddlefudger, holy forkeroni, and shirtballs coming from a space cowboy. Boothill’s duality is the main reason why I assigned him to Mingi because Mingi is goofy and quiet off stage but  when it’s time to perform, he’s an absolute badass, just like Boothill.

Wooyoung: Aventurine

Aventurine is a higher up at the Interastral Peace Corporation, who strives to achieve peace and stability across the galaxy through various reasons. He was born with supernatural luck, thus he is a daring gambler with incredible confidence and the ability to shield his entire team. That confidence is why I picked this character for Wooyoung because he oozes confidence whenever he performs. Behind that confidence is a bit of a moral heart, but I don’t want to spoil his backstory because it’s peak.


Jongho: Robin

Robin is an intergalactic popstar from Penacony whose music can heal and bring people together, so this was the obvious choice for Jongho. Her singing buffs the team and helps the Nameless through their journey in Penacony. She even goes as far as to travel to distant and dangerous planets to help those in need, even getting shot during one such conflict. Still, Robin never wavers in her singing and desire to bring others together, just as Jongho never stops striving to get better.

I (24F) have been in Chicago for a little over a year now and the dating scene honestly sucks unless you’re down to be in a polycule. I am bisexual and monogamous. I did find someone I was deeply attracted to earlier this year but they called things off due to personal trauma they hadn’t dealt with yet. Honestly a very calm split.

I have this neighbor that moved in on the first floor of my building sometime while I was on vacay in August. I used to be the only one on the first floor so now I have someone close by. The rest of my neighbors who live in the floors above are very introverted and I have only held longer convos with 2 of them. I would like to change that honestly to build a stronger sense of community.

I’ve seen this neighbor only 2-3 times in person but we have recently been texting quite a bit. And it’s not just for quick things to help each other out. But more getting to know you texts. He is out of town currently hence the mobile communication, or else we would have probably sat and spoke on our shared patio. I am not fully sure if I am getting a flirty vibe from him because things like that usually escape me via text but he definitely is holding the convo and seems to really want to get to know me. So much so he asked me out to grab coffee sometime. I didn’t want to read into that because people say that all the time, but never follow up. A day or so after that he asked to call me and we had a deeper convo about something we were texting about and he sent me the finer details of the coffee hang (date?) 

Now, as mentioned earlier I am not sure if I want to date this man. I just need someone to keep the bed warm this winter and I would be very transparent about that. But if things took off I would be open to exploring a potential relationship. Is it worth it to keep engaging and throw that vibe out? The vibe being that I would like to see him in that way. Because honestly I don’t want to be reading things wrong but rather reciprocate what I think he is putting down. I do think he is attractive. His personality is alluring so far. Is this a smart idea or too soon to tell? Or should neighbors just be off bounds in general and should I realize that I don’t live in a fairytale😅?

It’s almost like I want to be her backup because to me she’s an amazing girl.

A part of me doesn’t feel good about her not putting in effort for me, but I overlook it because our in person chemistry and interactions are so good.

[First post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/81w3vx/just_a_rant_to_people_who_will_finally_understand/): **Oct 3 2018**

So, firstly, I live in the south. We're pretty overrun here with Younique, doTERRA, LulaRoe, LipSense and Rodan & Fields. I have fourteen friends/family members who sell Younique. FOURTEEN, you guys. Facebook was hell until I turned off notifications for certain people in my FB feed. I was so happy to find this sub because SO MANY of my friends are falling prey to these stupid pyramid schemes.

All of that aside, I've had some infuriating experiences. My father-in-law has cancer. An aggressive cancer that was caught fairly late. His daughter sells doTERRA, and would probably transform into essential oils herself, if she could. Anyway, a couple of months after the diagnosis she convinced him to stop taking his medications and convinced him to *only* use doTERRA products.

I. Was. Livid.

He is genuinely one of the kindest people I know and he was guilted into stopping his *life saving medication*. He lets her live in his home, with her husband and kids, rent free. Her husband went to the hospital and had an emergency appendectomy and she actually posted on FB, ""we don't have any insurance but I'm not worried! Dad will pay for the bulk of the bills and doTERRA will cover the rest. I'm so, so blessed and you could be, too!"" Again... *I. Was. Livid.* (He paid almost $2800 to cover those bills for them.)

We *did* manage to get him to stop the stupid oils and go back on his meds (which SIL was very unhappy about and told him that if he died, it would be because he didn't extend his life with doTERRA products). Yeah. Again, I was furious that she'd be so manipulative.

A few years ago, that same SIL approached me about trying doTERRA for some medical issues. I'd had two miscarriages pretty close together and my second loss had only been 3-4 weeks behind me when she called me. She told me that if I'd try doTERRA, I'd never have another miscarriage again. I was honestly devastated that she could be so flippant about it and horrified that she genuinely believed what she was saying to me. I told her no, I wouldn't do that and that I was going to go ahead and proceed with my (very knowledgeable and kind) obgyn. She wasn't happy with that and didn't talk to me for at least 3 years.

My other issue is that some very smart friends are getting sucked into pyramid schemes almost left and right. The worst part is that they always call me and they're *so* happy. They're beyond thrilled that they've chosen to ""take the leap!"" of selling LipSense/Younique/Rodan. Then they usually launch into how the person who recruited them just threw an online party and they made several hundred dollars with another couple of hundred dollars of product and *how amazing is that*?!

I've gotten THREE phone calls between Friday and Saturday from three separate women who are all starting their journey into debt and idiotness.

To be fair, I've only had 4-5 people try to recruit me into selling. And one friend does phenomenally well with Younique. She got in very, very early here and now has several hundred girls selling underneath her. (I'm not kidding in the slightest.) She was able to quit her job as a dental hygienist (which she absolutely adored but she loves being her own #bossbabe even more, I guess) and she's earned a couple of trips. But the girls underneath her barely do well at all. Several of our mutual friends that she talked into it (it wasn't that hard after she showed everyone her checks and pictures of these amazing trips and then, 2 years later, her new home) have had to stop selling and just have a crap-ton of crappy products sitting around because they couldn't sell to anyone. Some are foolish enough to jump into a different pyramid scheme right away.

UGH.

I know this was so stupidly long and I'm sorry for that. It's just reeeeally nice to find a group of people who actually understand. I'm telling you, it's completely out of control where I live. I haven't been able to go one week, in several months, without someone trying to shove (horrible quality) products at me that I hate.

Thank you for reading my ridiculously long rant!

[Second post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/83sh0g/so_this_just_happened_to_me/)**: March 11 2018**

Several days ago I posted about how I'd just found this sub and was so happy that I found people who *get it*. I also talked about how I'm in the south and we're just absolutely overrun with people selling ""The Fab Five"" (Younique, LulaRoe, Rodan + Fields, LipSense and doTerra). 

Anyway, many of my friends sell 2 (and sometimes more) different MLM products. That's where my story really begins today.

I got a message from a good friend who lives about an hour away. She comes through town on business several times a year and we always get lunch or dinner and spend a couple of hours catching up. This has happened consistently for almost 3 years now. So, when she messaged me on Friday and told me she wanted to grab dinner on Sunday, I thought nothing of it. That's totally normal for us and I was excited and happy to see her.

We meet at the restaurant at the specified time and she immediately launches into how she's found this *incredible* business opportunity and, guess what, she took a leap, quit her job and took it!

I stare at her for a second with a sinking feeling in my stomach. Before I can even open my mouth she says, ""It's Younique! I joined Younique! Can you believe it?! I'm the happiest I've ever been and now I'm my own boss!""

I just want to stop here for a second and point out that she made over 70k a year working for an oil and gas company. Very comfy for a single woman here in the south. She had excellent benefits with paid vacation and frequent travel and, before this, she'd absolutely loved it.

Anyway, she launched into a spiel about how much Younique helps women and empowers them and how the owners are just so inspiring. She went on and on about how every purchase supports a wonderful charity and we've been such great friends for so long, how could I *not* join her team?!

Again I stared at her, just blinking as she finally stopped talking. I explained that I was glad she was happy but that I wasn't interested.

You guys...

She didn't even blink. She smoothly said, ""I thought you might say that and that's why I think doTerra is right up your alley!"" And she shoved a pile of papers in my face about doTerra.

She switched, just like that. She sells both. She joined both LAST WEEK. She almost put oil in her drink, but stopped when the waiter came by and just seemed to forget about it. I definitely wasn't going to remind her.

I tried to tell her that they were both terrible ideas and explained how they were pyramid schemes and you know what she said? ""Well, normally I'd trust you, but my girls got my back on this. I just wish you did, too. I'm really heartbroken that you're not loving me and supportive of my amazing ventures into being my own boss!"". I tried to tell her that me telling her those things was exactly because I love and care about her and her future but she wasn't having it.

We went our separate ways with her calling out, ""if you change your mind, babes, you know where I am! Would love to have you on my team because we're winners!"". (She has never, ever called me ""babes"" before.)

My jaw dropped. I was just so shocked by the whole thing.

So, there's my story. Why are so many people in the south drawn into these? It's like a freaking plague! AAARRGHHH.

[Third Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8427se/update_on_my_friend_who_met_me_for_dinner_and/): **March 13 2018**

So... Just thought I'd let you guys know the next phase. She is *furious* with me. I texted our mutual friends and told them that if they heard from her, it was probably going to be about Younique/doTerra.

Only one friend humored her and bought about $200 worth of products from her. She considered joining her Younique team, but decided not to when several of us reached out to her and explained what was happening. This girl is very sweet and very naive and genuinely had no clue. She was surprised to hear the list of things to avoid as we named off companies and she goes, ""...I have most of those in my house. I just thought they were all bad products. Every time I have a complain or want a refund, they tell me it's my problem and that I wasn't using it right."" And, bless her soul, she believed them. She said she's almost joined several ""teams"" in different companies and the only reason she didn't is because her current job is too demanding.

Whew.

But anyway, my friend who's selling Y/DT is madder than a wet hen! She left me a scathing voicemail, which I didn't even fully listen to because it was so mean.

Here's the thing, we've always been pretty good friends. Not super close, we don't text or call or even fb very often, but we're close enough to enjoy spending time together when she came through town for work.

Her older sister sells Younique. Her older sister who has always treated her like she just kind of doesn't exist, isn't really important, etc. (it was always very sad to see). She has always wanted to be close to her big sister and absolutely idolizes her, so I think that's where a lot of this is stemming from. And wouldn't you know it? Her sister told my friend to ""cut all the losers loose"" because we're going to be jealous of her success because ""everyone in the south knows that Younique is *the* best company to be a part of!"".

Just thought I'd give an update for those who wanted it!

Thanks for being here, guys. I hate seeing these ruin people's lives. It's getting awful here in the south, specifically the good ol' Bible belt. Many of my friends are in debt, denial or in strained relationships because of money issues. It makes me very, very sad to see. And almost none of them will listen to those of us who genuinely care about their well-being and their futures.

[Fourth Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/85en7k/update_on_my_friend_who_left_her_70k_job_for/): **March 18 2018**

My friend is still in this area. Since I keep saying ""friend"" from here on out, I'll call her ""Leontina"". We'll call her sister ""Ramune"".

Leontina lives (normally) a few hours away from me. She used to live much closer, but her job moved her several hours away. She has 2 cats and a frog. (This is relevant, promise.) Her older sister, Ramune, lives very close to me. About a 25 minute drive in a small outer suburb from where I am. Leontina has been staying with Ramune since she got here a week ago. (Yes. You read that right. This whole entire stupid saga started only ONE WEEK AGO.) So, she's been here peddling YN and DT for a week, under her sister's guidance, while her WHOLE LIFE is back, in another state, several hours away. That may not seem super relevant, but it rubs me the wrong way even more knowing that strangers are taking care of her pets. (Her neighbor at her apartment complex who she doesn't really know very well, apparently.)

I decided to try one more time and talk to Leontina. Once I learned she was still here from a mutual friend, that just made this plan much more appealing. I felt like video chatting or texting/calling just wasn't going to cut it.

So... I reached out to Leontina and told her I wanted to sit down and talk. She immediately agreed. She told me she didn't like how we left things and she'd like to get together. Okay, so far, so good. Then... She texted me and said she wanted to bring Ramune. Immediately I felt off about that. I told her that I preferred it just be her and I. I mean, I don't really even know Ramune. Never liked her much, to be honest. She was always pretty awful to Leontina and was very rude to a lot of people when we were in high school. She was a year ahead of us and I was glad when she graduated as it eased some of the stress off of Leontina, who was always trying to get Ramune's attention and approval. (Very, very sad.) Long story short, Leontina refused to come without Ramune. 

I met them at a small coffee shop because I was not about to have them both at my house at the same time.  Anyway, the moment they came in, Ramune just started berating me. How dare I hurt her sister like this? How dare I try to stop her from living her dreams? A supportive friend would NEVER behave like that! Maybe Leontina wouldn't be ""wildly successful"" right off the bat, but I could at least support her while she's trying to take control of her future! What do I even know about business? I just have an Etsy store full of useless, unattractive items that no one buys unless they're desperate. How dare I try to intervene in Leontina's life?

I just stared, openmouthed at this entire thing. Luckily, there weren't many people in the cafe but the ones who were there looked vaguely concerned. Ramune wasn't being very loud. She was more speaking rapidly at a low volume. And she was FURIOUS. Absolutely livid at me. The weird amount of anger in her eyes was totally baffling. I'm still trying to figure it out.

So, when she finally stopped to freaking breathe... I told her that I had no intention of stopping Leontina from living her dreams. Leontina is a big girl who can make her own decisions and I care about her and what happens to her. Unlike Ramune, who never gave a single crap until Leontina started selling Younique. 

OOOOH. Wrong thing to say to her. She immediately grabbed Leontina's hand and left. No retort. No reply. Just an angry, disgusted look and then they left. The entire time Leontina just stood there looking smug. Not kidding at all. She looked totally smug that her sister was saying all of this to me.

So... that's where we are with things. Her sister is a controlling jerk, just like she always was in high school. Except now, she's doing it to her sister instead of her friends.

I left feeling a little shell-shocked as that wasn't what I expected. I don't know what I expected, but it wasn't that.

[Fifth Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/867dny/update_on_my_friend_who_left_her_job_for_younique/): **March 21 2018**

Guess who got a knock on their door today? Me.  Guess who was on the other side of that door? Ramune. I was expecting a yarn delivery as my last USPS update had said it was ""out for delivery"". They usually just knock and leave the package on the front porch, so, I was verrrry caught off guard when I saw who it was. I didn't even really know what to say. I stammered around like a moron and said, ""uh, why are you existing... on my porch?"". It made no sense and I felt like an idiot. Ramune rolled her eyes, sighed (dramatically) and said, ""Leontina wanted me to apologize to you, in person, for the other day."" 

Again, I just stared at her like a moron. She said Leontina was in the car waiting so I finally gathered myself enough to say, ""does... she want to come in? Do you guys want to come in...?"" But I was very hesitant. Ramune said that Leontina was going to stay in the car but that she wanted to talk to me herself. Again, those alarm bells went off. She had a weird look in her eyes. So I told her that I'd rather her not come in after our last interaction and that I was grateful she came by to apologize but that I had other things to do. She stared at me for a few seconds, not saying anything at all. I was fixing to say ""okay, well... Bye, then"" or something, but before I could say anything she goes, ""I did my part now text Leontina and tell her you're sorry, too, and that we're fine. She doesn't have many friends now and you need to support her more.""

Again... I stared at her like an idiot. I almost started laughing. Because who acts like that?

Then she said, ""happy people sell products and recruit more people on their teams. I can't have a sad, negative person bringing the vibe of my team down. I need my sister happy and ready to sell."". Then she put on her sunglasses and walked back to her car.

And that was it. She didn't wait for my reply, she didn't listen to anything else, she just walked away.

Also, just by the way, I didn't see anyone else in the car. From how our house is sitting, you can't see the driveway from the front door so I couldn't even look until she backed out into the street, but you guys, I didn't see anyone in that car. Maybe she was just bending down in the seat to get something off of the floor of the car? That makes logical sense. But I didn't see her. Which is just weird. The entire thing is weird.

[Sixth Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/86v6c7/update_on_my_friend_who_left_her_job_for_younique/): **Mar 21 2018**

Yesterday morning I got a call from one of Leontina and my mutual friends. She called me on her way to work and she was freaking out.  She was running a little behind, so, at the time she was only able to give me a little bit of info. She told me that three of our mutual friends have now joined Leontina's Younique team. I literally had no words. What's weirder is that my friend on the phone had just had lunch 2 days before this with one of the girls and they had talked briefly about how they were concerned about the Leontina situation and how we were all just going to step back from it and let it be. (Because Leontina and Ramune had both verbally attacked all of us and some of us more than others, so, the end decision was, ""They're both adults and can do what they want; At least we've tried to reach out several times."") She told me she was shocked by this and that none of them would reply past what one of the girls had said to her in the initial text (which she couldn't tell me at that time due to the time constraints but would fill me in on later).

The three girls we'll call Kate, Paige and Stephanie. Paige lives a few hours away but Kate and Stephanie are both in this area. Not directly, but close enough to be a 45-1 hr drive away. I live in a decent sized city and live about an hour away from another large-ish city, both cities are where most of us ended up after college. I know that Ramune approached Kate a few days ago, the same day that she'd just shown up at my house. She did the same thing to Kate, more or less. Kate quickly filled all of us in on the group chat and I said that Ramune had just been to my place, too. So, everyone was on alert.

And then here we are, a few days later, and THREE of them have joined Leontina's Younique team. You guys, it's like they're just... gone. They left the group chat and none of them would reply to my texts, either.

All this being said, I feel like I need to point out that they're all adults and can do what they want with their lives. However, it doesn't sit well with me, or the friend that called me, and we're totally shocked. Especially that Stephanie joined. Because, wow. She was probably the most angry about how Ramune was taking advantage of Leontina. But... she was also Leontina's best friend and has been her best friend for years, so I can see how she might get sucked in to the situation, simply because she misses her friend. I get that. It's still surprising.

So, later last night, my friend called me back. She told me that the initial text she got was from Kate who said, basically, ""Hey, this is probably going to make you guys upset, but Paige, Steph and I are joining Leontina's Younique team. We've given it a lot of thought and we want to support her however we can. It's not okay to not speak to people just because they're operating a business and we'd never thought of it that way. Maybe we don't love the products but we are all excellent salespeople and can sell the hell out of this makeup and we'll all make a little extra money. We hope you'll support all of us through this journey!"" And that was it. My friend replied, initially, with ""lol, that's hilarious"" because she genuinely thought Kate was joking.

Nope. And she never got another reply. She didn't answer her phone calls, either. My friend started getting concerned and also tried to reach Paige and Steph and couldn't. That's why she was running late to work because she was trying to figure all of this out and it was truly baffling to her.

As of right now, Paige, Kate and Steph are all awol. No replies to us. I stalked Ramune's FB page and saw that she was ""thrilled"" that her team had grown more and she was treating the newest members to a spa day. That spa day is happening right now.

We, my friend that called me and I, have been cut off. Which, honestly, we're okay with. There's some weiiiiiiiiird crap going on here. I'm telling you, these girls NEVER would have joined this. Paige actually went on and on about how manipulative R is and how she never liked her and how she hates how she sucks so many women into MLMs. (R's YN team is far larger than I initially thought.)

So... there's the next part of this whole thing. At least I'm not involved in this part, which gives me a sense of relief. Because ain't nobody got time for that. I mean, indirectly, it does. And I'm now worried for four friends instead of one. The whole thing is unsettling. Now I think maybe Ramune, if I had let her in, would have tried to talk me into joining her team. I don't know.

Let's leave planet earth. I no longer want to live here.

[Seventh Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/87v5yg/update_on_my_friend_who_quit_her_job_to_sell/): **Mar 28 2018**

Yesterday, I got an email. This isn't it in the entirety, but it's most of it:

>Sojadedblond, I'm emailing you from an account I created just to send you this. I'm pretty sure you'll know who this is, but I'm asking you to not tell anyone. Delete this, don't confront anyone and just act like you're not aware of what's happening. Please. I'm trying to leave someone's Younique team and can't have more drama in my life, so please don't give my name out. I'm pretty worried about how things are going and you've always been a loyal friend so you need to know what someone is planning to do. Someone feels like you hurt her business by telling people they should be careful before they just join her Younique team. She feels like you robbed her of about 10-20 team members and she's really pissed about it. This someone added about 30 girls to a group chat not too long ago and tried to get us to support her sister who is one of the newer members in her team. You warned people against it saying that most people don't make money and that they should be careful. Obviously, you know this, but this is why this person has been so specifically mad about these things. She's been planning on getting a friend of hers, someone on her team, to do this. Many have said they'd love to do it because they pretty much worship the ground she walks on. It's bad. I didn't understand it was like this. They all want to make as much money as she does from this. Guess what? They won't. I won't. I'm only a few days in and I know we won't. I've lost $480 that I won't get back. She constantly tells us to buy more and more product to sell. If we don't, she puts us on blast in front of the group. If we do, she's suddenly our best friend. She's having someone on her team place a large order in your store and then they're going to leave you a 1-star review. ""you hurt our business, we can do the same"" is where she's coming from. I just wanted to give you a heads up because if you get a large order, just don't accept it, I guess? I'm sorry this happened. I don't understand how she's like this. You guys were right. I'm a little nervous about what she'll do when I leave. It shouldn't matter, right? She's got so many other girls working with her. Wish me luck.

And that was it. I know, in the grand scheme of things, this isn't a huge deal. However, my business is a small one. I just started it about 4 months ago and honestly, reviews on Etsy can make or break you. These are handmade items that other people can't touch or wear in person, until they buy them, so they have to go off of the words of others who have bought before them. Usually I let stuff like this roll off of my back because it's petty and childish behavior and I can just go on with my life. But, I've worked very hard to make the items I have. They take a lot of time and effort and having someone purposely try to sabotage that, even just a little bit, hurts. Also, I would hate for these items that I've so carefully made, just go to someone who won't even wear/use them. They'll, what? Throw them away? Burn them? Who spends money on things like this just to behave this way? I would never do this to Ramune, even though I despise her behavior and the way she hurts and manipulates others.

Ramune has a lot of people on her Younique team. It's much larger than I initially thought. And I know they're not all here in this area. So do I just not accept any large order for a few months? Do I accept them and hope for the best? I'm not sure what to do here.

[Eighth Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/89s9a2/update_on_my_friend_who_left_her_job_for_younique/): **Apr 4 2018**

THERE IS NO UPDATE.

All has been quiet since my last update and.. I AM LOVING IT.

However...  I did snoop through Ramune's and Leontina's FB page a bit. Leontina has alienated EVERYONE. She has made several posts complaining about how people who love and support you will always support your business and buy from you, how ""real friends"" are the ones who join your team. She even made a post saying that she'd pitch in $50 for someone to buy a Younique starter kit if they'd join her team. And on all the posts it's only other presenters who are encouraging this and cheering her on. Ramune's FB is a whooooole other story. Everyone adores her there. It's honestly like some sort of hellhole MLM mean girls echo chamber. She made one post about how she's so #blessed to be surrounded by so many strong women who look up to her and that she's like a proud mama bird showing all these baby birds how to fly and be responsible business owners. Gross. She did make a mildly threatening remark to someone who questioned some of the Younique products, I think the mascara, but that was the extent of the drama. ""No negativity is allowed on her page; Only empowering, uplifting things!"" Again: Gross.

[Ninth Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8catjo/update_on_the_l_r_situation/): **Apr 14 2018**

So... There's not much to tell but L texted me very late last night / early this morning. (Around 2:45 AM, to be exact. I was still up because I had a root canal Friday and it's the worst. Highly don't recommend.) Anyway, this is what happened:

L: You may have been right. I've been up stressing over my finances. My $12k savings are gone. All in barely over a month. I think you were right. I'm having more wine and going to bed.

Me: Oh, L. I'm so sorry to hear that. That's incredibly discouraging, I know. Is there anything I can do to help?

No reply yet. Maybe I should have waited until I got a reply before updating you guys, but it was so completely out of nowhere and I figure that if she was going to reply, she would have by now. Or maybe it was the wine talking. She's still at her sister's house (R) so I'm sure R talked her right back into things this morning.

Ugh.

I'm hoping she's coming out of the MLM stupor!

[Final Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/antiMLM/comments/8rw7rd/update_on_my_friend_who_left_her_job_for_younique/): **Jun 17 2018**

As of about a week and a half ago, I got an update from a mutual friend about Leontina. While it wasn't the worst thing I've heard about a friend in an MLM, it wasn't great... but not unexpected, either. And then it got weirder.

So, a mutual friend told me that Leontina recently borrowed a significant amount of money from Ramune and from their parents. When I say significant amount, I mean *significant*, you guys. Apparently, she blew a large portion of her savings on a trip to Cancun (I think that's where they went) very early on as Ramune had told her that it's a way to show your haters that you're doing just fine and hey, Leontina was going to make it all back with Younique really quickly anyway! (Spoiler alert: She did not. Hence the borrowed money.)

There next update I got was that Leontina and Ramune had a huge fight about Leontina wanting to quit doTerra. Here's where it just gets weird: Ramune doesn't sell doTerra. I'm not even sure she uses it. If she does, she's not one of those people who preaches about on social media. Which would seem odd because she talks about every other MLM product that she buys, uses and ""supports other women with"". So, her fighting Leontina to keep doTerra just strikes me as extremely off. She doesn't sell it or use it - why make her sister (who has sold almost *zero* inventory) keep selling it? It would give Leontina more time to focus on selling Younique.

So, Leontina has moved in with a guy she met less than a month ago and refuses to talk to any of us now. When a mutual friend saw her downtown, Leontina was wearing things she'd never worn before and seemed drunk at 2 PM. Or at least ""tipsy"", our friend said. Our friend was worried and tried to talk to her but Leontina acted like she didn't know her. 

Here's where it gets even weirder... The guy Leontina's living with used to work with another mutual friend's fiance. And now? That guy is in Primerica. So.... That's what's happening.

For those of you who wanted an update, here you go! If any of you have advice or ideas on how else to reach out and help, please let me know. I love hearing from you guys and you always have great advice and support. If I could hug all of you, I would!

After my visit to Mirror Pool, sleep is no longer the escape it once was. Nights are fractured into a string of feverish dreams, each one pulling me back to that lake. I wake up in the dark, feeling like something cold and wet is clutching my wrist. I tell myself it’s just leftover adrenaline, but I can’t shake the feeling that my reflection—or whatever I saw in the water—followed me home.

 

I try to keep it to myself, but when I start seeing her in every reflective surface, I lose it. I find myself avoiding mirrors, covering anything that might show my reflection. Yet, every glimpse, every accidental glance, shows her lingering, waiting. And each time, that twisted, unsettling smile is there, barely concealed. The worst part is that I’m beginning to feel it pulling at me. It’s like every sight of her in glass or water leaves a trace, a calling that digs deeper and deeper.

 

Today, though, I decide to confide in Eli. Eli’s my best friend, and he knew Evelyn almost as well as I did. He’s got this logical, level-headed way of looking at things—exactly what I need right now. We meet at Laketon’s only diner, a place where the lights are bright, and there’s no chance of finding my reflection in a window or a pool of water on the floor.

 

""So, how’ve you been holding up?” he asks, sipping his coffee. His expression is careful, but I can see he’s worried.

 

“I went to Mirror Pool,” I say, and his face darkens. He knew this would happen eventually.

 

“Why would you go back there?” he asks, looking around as if someone might overhear us talking about that place.

 

I tell him about the anniversary, about the things I saw, the voice that called to me from the water, and the reflection I keep seeing in mirrors. As I speak, he listens without interrupting, but I can see the doubt creeping into his eyes.

 

“You’re saying your reflection is… haunted?” He’s trying to keep his tone neutral, but I can feel the skepticism. I can’t blame him. It sounds insane.

 

“I know how it sounds, Eli,” I snap, but my voice wavers. “But Evelyn wrote about it in her journal. She saw it, too. There’s something wrong with that place.”

 

He pauses, his coffee cup halfway to his lips. “Look, I believe you, okay? You’re not… making this up. But are you sure it’s not just… I don’t know, your mind trying to fill in the gaps? You’ve been through a lot, and grief does weird things to people.”

 

“Maybe it is grief,” I say quietly, glancing out the window. “But if you’d seen what I saw… you’d understand why I can’t just ignore it.”

 

He sighs, setting his coffee cup down. “Fine. Let’s go back, then. Together. Just to prove to you there’s nothing there.” He says it like he’s trying to convince both of us.

That night, we set out. The forest is darker than I remembered, the trees looming taller, as if they’ve grown in the time since I last came here. The air feels thick, almost suffocating, and I can’t shake the sensation of being watched. The crunch of leaves and twigs underfoot is the only sound, and it feels obscenely loud in the stillness.

 

Eli’s flashlight sweeps across the path as we make our way closer to Mirror Pool. When we finally reach the clearing, the lake looks even more unnatural under the thin moonlight. The water is too still, reflecting the sky in a way that’s too perfect, like it’s waiting for us to step closer.

 

“You see?” I whisper, nodding toward the lake. “There’s something off. It’s like it’s not… real.”

 

Eli frowns, scanning the lake’s surface. “It’s just water, man.”

 

But I can see him tense as we approach the edge, his steps slowing as if he’s feeling the same unease. I take a deep breath and kneel, peering down at the water.

 

At first, it’s just us—our faces reflected in the glassy surface. But as I stare, my reflection begins to change. Her smile starts to creep onto her face again, lips curling upward into that same eerie, knowing grin. She tilts her head, as if she’s inviting me to come closer.

 

And then… her hand moves. It presses against the water’s surface from underneath, fingers curling upward as if she’s about to pull herself out. Her eyes are locked onto mine, filled with something dark, something hungry.

 

Eli’s face pales. “What… what is that?” he whispers, stumbling back. I can tell he sees it too.

 

Before I can respond, her hand breaks the surface, dripping with dark, murky water as it reaches toward us. She’s climbing out, her eyes fixed on me with that same smile, that same twisted expression of glee.

 

Eli and I stumble back, nearly falling as she reaches for us. My heart is pounding so hard I can barely hear anything else. I try to drag Eli back with me, but he’s frozen, his gaze locked on her as if he’s trapped.

 

“Eli!” I shout, and that seems to snap him out of it. We run, tearing through the woods, our footsteps echoing through the trees. I can feel her watching us, sense her lurking just behind, her voice a faint whisper that’s growing louder, repeating over and over.

 

“Come back… stay with me.”

 

I barely remember getting home. I stumble through the door, slamming it shut behind me, heart racing as I lean against it, trying to catch my breath. Eli follows a moment later, wide-eyed and silent.

 

“You saw it too, didn’t you?” I ask, my voice barely above a whisper.

 

Eli nods, his face pale. “It… it looked like you, but it wasn’t. That smile… God, that smile. What the hell is going on?”

 

I don’t have an answer. All I know is that she—whatever she is—wants something from me. And now that I’ve gone to the lake, now that I’ve seen her, she’s not going to stop.

That night, sleep is impossible. I hear her voice in every shadow, every creak of the floorboards, every whisper of wind outside my window. I cover every mirror, every reflective surface I can find, but it doesn’t matter. She’s there, lurking in the edges of my vision, her smile growing wider each time I look away.

In my dreams, she’s waiting by the lake, her hand outstretched, beckoning me forward. Her mouth moves, but her words are a distorted version of my own voice.

*“Come back… come home.”*

I wake up in a cold sweat, my heart hammering, and glance at the covered mirror by my bed. For a moment, I swear I see her silhouette in the darkness, her hand reaching toward me.

We live a rather comfortable life and don’t really need for much. We are also old school traditional in the sense he works, I take care of the home. It works really well for us, don’t have to pay for daycare, etc. However, it’s been brought up on more than one occasion that there are still situations in which I could use his help in regards to the “home duties” and that I feel he can be selfish because it doesn’t even register to him to help after being asked. Things like watching the kids so I can shower more than once a week, if there’s something specific he needs cleaned to wear to work he has to tell me, groceries he might need for his breakfast ((mind you it took me a few years to get him to make his own breakfast as he gets up relatively earlier than I need to for the kids and that’s not to mention I still get up with him to make the coffee because he doesn’t know how 😒)), help take care of the dogs seeing as he had one of them before he even had me…but I digress.
However this last time it got brought up it turned into a bigger deal than normal due to me being incredibly upset before the conversation. But here’s why…We’ve had the stomach flu going around the house for the last week, only hitting the kids. Well lucky me as soon as they all were done, it came after me. ((More context, when the husband gets sick he is literally waited on hand and foot, not bothered by the kids, and gets to sleep all day if needed.)) So normally when I get sick I’ll just keep working through it. But we had a lot going on through Oct, I had just spent the last week up all night with sick kids, we have three, and for some reason it just hit hard this time and I was out for the count. Husband didn’t know until morning as it hit me in the middle of the night. He told me to go lay down if I needed and he would take care of the kids that morning. I ended up getting up to get the youngest breakfast because she woke up while he was playing his video game and he needed to finish his round, he did however take care of it when the next woke up. After that I went to lay back down again which shortly after I’m joined by our four yr old and than our 7 yr old. Which again, I would’ve liked to sleep, but they were just laying with me playing their games so not that bad. My husband then joins us in the bedroom to ask if he should still go help his parents tow their car. A previous plan he did have but one his parents also told us didn’t need to be done for 6 months, so no rush. I told him he could make that choice. To which he decides to go, but not to worry because he’d be super fast and be back to help with kids errands and such that also had been planned. His parents live a minimum of 90 min away…not including the time he needed to go swap out the car for the tow truck. So needless to say, he doesn’t come home till dinner. I never got to stay in bed, almost had a poop accident while out running errands because apparently the 4 yr old was still sick also, had some psycho in a big truck try to run us off the road because the 10 cars in front of me on the one lane road we were on weren’t going faster…and just a whole day of this while still running a fever and throwing up myself.
When he gets home, he decides to tell me about his lovely day. Where he got to take his dog in the truck on the super fast trip to his parents to tow the car….yeah no apparently was a doggy play date where they all decided to go out and get lunch together afterwards. 
((More context, his parents also knew I was at home sick and that he was supposed to be back help and he was texting me during this time telling me how sorry he was the whole process was taking so long.)) 
But then went on about how annoying it was that his little brother took ages to get ready and so on. And well my response was to attempt to tell him how inconsiderate I thought his actions today had been, he yelled at me and left the room. Which turned into a night of me not talking to him because I was going to scream if I tried. Finally before bed as I am laying all the kids down he asks me to join him so he can say goodnight to me before he goes to bed himself. He asked me “are you okay?” And I told him no. And that I thought it was a joke he was even asking after how the day went. I lost it and went off about how selfish the family has been with always expecting me to be there to wait on them but when I genuinely need help none of them are there for me. And that he sets a prime example for that when he behaves the same way. I told him that when I try to talk to him about these things he does what he had done earlier and gets mad and jumps to an extreme. To which he then took it to an extreme and basically was trying to make it sound like I was calling him a bad dad. So I just left the conversation and went back to laying the kids to bed. Everyone’s asleep now except me because I can’t stop thinking maybe I’m being selfish here. But idk 🤷🏻‍♀️ 
So I’m just wondering, AITA for telling my husband he’s selfish?

I didnt want to make too long a post but its going to be cause of my recent medical situation. About 4 years ago alot started happening to me and alot of ailments I have cant really be explained by docs, although some were. 4 years ago my dermatologists told me I have mild HS, a skin related auto immune disease that pretty much has ruined my life. Even though its ""mild"" form, without getting into it, it stops me from doing so much including being able to exercise like a normal person and hinders alot of day to day activity. After a failed treatment from that, I noticed a lump on my neck. It was an enlarged lymph node. Going from doctor to doctor, it was traced to my thyroid where, after a biopsy, I tested positive for thyroid cancer. Total thyroidectomy, radioactive treatment, finding the right balance of thyroid meds, blah blah, now im cancer free and my meds are the right dosage. tsh, thyoglobulin, free t3 all that stuff looks good on work ups. Ive suffered bad headaches my whole life as well and i also have a really badly hearniated disc (t6-t7) in my back that shoots down my left arm. Ok thats my history for the big stuff.

So around the time post surgery, i started getting these weeks where my chest would be tingly especially laying down and I just didnt feel like myself for the entire duration of the episode. Then a few epsidoes later I began getting a sinking feelings in my chest. It would have a slight buildup and then the drop. Feeling my radial pulse when it happened, i would feel a longer pause on a beat then a supercharged beat that would feel a bit heavier. Talking to both my primary and cardiologist, they didnt really seem to concerned. I did a halter monitor for a month, which showed a fair amount of PAC's but nothing concerning (to them) and 1 strip where they saw a supposed minor blockage (1 sample in a whole month). Again nothing concerning to professionals. I did an MRI with contrast. No cholesterol buildup or plaque and only thing remarkable was a PFO from birth. Also from about 3 years ago when i was trying a treatment for the HS, i started getting pain in my lower legs. This pain also spikes when im having one of these chest episodes. My cardiologist says my pulse in my legs feels fine. Ive also had a few sonograms of my legs and there was no restricted bloodflow. For some reason I also have hairloss on the outside of my legs when these episodes occur. Afterwards it starts to grow back, untill the next episode. My cardiologist said he couldnt explain it. :(

My primary put me on Cymbaltta (Duloxetine) bc she thought the palpatations were stemming from anxiety. They have not helped with these episodes. (Although I am in a better mood overall for someone who has all this stuff). First few weeks were a misery but Ive gotten used to the drug and now its ok, and im gonna continue taking it.

So currently I am in an episode. I cant 100% ID what sets them off but I have noticed maybe the days prior to them I arent eating the best foods especially in the sense of sugar. My A1C and bloodwork is always fine for diabetic related markers but this can be the only thing i see as a potential trigger. I dont drink coffee. I do drink diet soda and sometimes tea, but alot less caffeine then most. These are the rest of my symptoms right now and most are present when im having one of these episodes: (btw these last for a week- 2 weeks every month or 2 months)

\-Chest feels light, not painful, just slightly tingly

\- Eye sight is slighty blurry, like it takes an extra half second to focus on something after changing my view.

\- I feel a little dizzy when i walk around, like a minor vertigo like feeling. Very sluggish and lightheaded. Dont feel like im here. Dont feel normal at all.

\- I can have little breakouts of sweating even if its cool. Somewhat shorter of breath sometimes.

\- Pulse is more frequently on the tachy side, sometimes in the high 90s resting and sometimes its pronounced enough to where i can feel it.

\- I get a strange sensation on the front side of my left shoulder. Cant really describe it. Sometimes feels like its pulsating or tingling or tiny little bugs when i lay down.

\-Very Very Tired during these episodes. I can sleep 10 hours, wake up and need to go back to sleep a few hours later. Just cant stay up to save my life. I felt this way when i was off my thyroid meds during the months before the radioiodine. Same type of feeling.

\- Cold Extremities.

So yeah. Also after a shower the chest drop/ skipped beat thing is more frequent. But I havnt had an answer from any doctors. Tons of test and questions and I come to accept so many things that I have wrong but like this one is really getting to me and not a single answer. If anyone can maybe put it together I would appreciate it so much. To me it sounds heart related like a-fib or something but everything has checked out test wise. I dont mind sharing any tests if anyone wanted to look at something but I would love any sort of insight if anything sounds familiar.

Current Medications: Levothroxine, Duloxotene, Oxycodone & Lyrica (for Back only recently started), Omeprazole, Famotidine.

1gnveek,https://www.reddit.com/r/letters/comments/1gnveek/you_outta_know/,You outta know. ,"You’re acting strange now, and I understand. You’re letting me stay here alone, which you already know kills me because I’m lonely and avoidant. I’m trying to get better, but I miss everyone, but I’m too scared to go out and talk to people. I’m doing my best, but now you just want to abandon me again.

I come over almost every other day to have a cigarette with you, bring you coffee, or even bring us something for lunch on our 20-minute trek to the coffee shop at night. I miss these days. The way things are going right now is killing me slowly. I feel more pain in my body than anything else.

One day, everyone will wake up and realize I’m gone for good. I might consider going for a consultation for physician-assisted suicide (PAS). As lonely as I am and the mistakes I’ve made, the damage of this broken heart may be the answer to all my problems. I don’t want to feel the pain of not having any support.

I suppose even my ex created a lot of the problems I’m facing, like love, friendship, and entertainment. I don’t even have a sex life anymore. He’s probably laughing his spoiled ass off, yelling, “KARMA IS A BITCH!”

But whatever if I go through with this, there’s no undoing it. Once it’s done, it’s done. I’m sorry, but I think this is game over for me. My social media is finally gone, so no one can grieve over my stuff when I’m gone. You’ve done more damage than anyone else can do. I hope karma bites back at you. Because if not, I’ll haunt you when I’m a ghost! Peace the fuck out.

Credits to [CoffeeTraveler](https://www.twitch.tv/coffeetraveler), ArosRising, [Imoartel](https://www.twitch.tv/maxxarp), [gerGGar](https://www.youtube.com/@gerggar5177) (the previous world record holder), and the Brotato community for previous Max Bait challenges.

Please refer to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/brotato/comments/1abm7p5/new_max_bait_challenge_world_record_327_baits/) for explanations and execution breakdown for the Max Bait challenge.

Brotato's new DLC, Abyssal Terrors, introduces both the Curse mechanic as well as the Abyss, which has its own bestiary. The reroll reduction and various patches further increased the ceiling and consistency of what's possible.

Cursed and buffed Lampreys are particularly problematic,; the sheer damage meant I was forced into a Shield start. Furthermore, enemies in The Abyss are more deadly compared to Crash Zone. The strategies remain more or less the same, though the gameplan has changed towards building for both damage and survival via Armor. Goblet stabilized my run, and by Wave 17, things truly got ridiculous.

Apologies for losing Wave 14 shop footage. I was streaming and had lost connection partway.

Further improvements to the run include the following:

1. Starting with Sticks instead of Shields
2. Finding Cursed Spyglasses
3. Finding earlier, Cursed economy items (Bag, Crown, Black Flag, Starfish, Hunting Trophies)

It's definitely possible to push past 600 Baits with an extreme highroll.

As a side note, if I were to submit feedback to Blobfish, the Anglerfish are incredibly annoying in Pacifist runs and having individual Cursed Baits needs to be condensed.

1gnv4nf,https://www.reddit.com/r/askmanagers/comments/1gnv4nf/in_appropriate_or_friendly_manager/,In appropriate or friendly manager ,"Hi,

So I (20F) work at a restaurant and recently have been receiving some odd text messages from my manager (53M) who is married with kids. 

For some context, the reason this manager has my phone number is because we were planning a night out with staff and we were trying to figure out who was coming. I seen no issue in him asking for my number as we were planning this out.

A few days before the staff event he asked me to go for coffee which I agreed too. I thought it was a little weird that he offered to pick me up stating it would be a bit more “elegant” opening the door for me and the place he choose for coffee was a bit more upscale than Starbucks or Tim Hortons. But I brushed it off thinking I was being paranoid.

Coffee went well and he texted me after saying he enjoyed it and “I could stare at those eyes forever.” Again a little weird but I said I had a good time. Nothing felt weird at coffee other than him trying to share a brownie with me. I respectfully declined saying I wasn’t hungry. 

Time for the staff event came around and he was texting me saying he couldn’t get the staff together but was wondering if I still wanted to go out. I made up an excuse about why I couldn’t go. 

Till this day months later, he is still asking me to go out for another coffee with him. I’ve made up excuse after excuse to not go as I’m getting uncomfortable. I have a sibling who works with me and if I’m ever sick or something happens he always texts me. After every shift we have together he texts me. He doesn’t have a car and asks different staff members to drive him home and when I do he always texts me afterwards. I don’t respond for days on end and only do a day before we work together as I don’t want it to be weird at work. He is a manager but not the general manager. 

This is the latest text he sent to me. My other manager was complimenting him on this relationship with his wife and I was standing next to her rolling cutlery. 

“Hello you, I wanted to say earlier on and not sure if you heard it but you were right there  and “other manager” was praising how good my relationship with my wife is ,which it is but I felt a bit embarrassed and a little guilty cause of how I am with my feelings towards you. I told my wife about you  what little there is and it's from my side as I have no idea how you feel and you owe nothing to me it's all on me . My wife and I have a pretty good relationship and quite different from the normal I guess but it works good. I can't explain it here maybe one day if you are interested of course I could tell  you. Anyhow like I said before I have a lot of respect for you and if it's awkward I will always honor your feelings on this matter I hope it doesn't stop us having another coffee date in the not too distant future. Anyhow I hope you got to have supper in the end.”

How do I end this without making it awkward. Do I tell the GM or try to sort it out with him first?

I recently got a Hario Gooseneck for my adventure down the pour over coffee rabbit hole, and a V60 with a thermometer is coming soon. My current problem is the grinder.

So my dad currently has espressos every day (black in the morning, latte in the afternoon), and we have a Breville Smart Grinder Pro right now. We don't have the space or money to get a single-shot grinder specifically for pour-overs, but I do want to get a Fellow Ode 2 (thank god for the frequent sightings of the Ode in this sub, gives me a lot of reassurance that it's what I will enjoy based on everyone else's trust in it) if and when I do end up moving out of my parents' place. Thus I have several questions about this grinder - 

Firstly, I do know that the grinder is capable of pour overs. However I'm wondering if constantly dialling the grind size between the espresso area (super fine, all the way on the right is where my dad has it) and the pour over area of the grind scale is going to be bad? Either for the machine by constantly switching or for the both of us by leaving unwanted chunks whenever we switch the sizes (since we'll be making coffee at pretty much the same time every morning, i.e. me leaving larger, coarser chunks in his serve of portafilter or him leaving massive amounts of fines in my own nel drip). 

Secondly, even if the above proves not to be a problem, how would one go about grinding for pour overs using the Breville Grinder - as it is not a single shot machine? As far as I can tell we'll have to memorise or write down the exact grind times the machine tells us - e.g. 18sec or so for my dad's espresso and however long it'll take the machine to give me 15g for my serve. 

Lastly (?), any recommendations on dosing cups that sit nicely inside the breville machine? And on a slight tangent do you guys have any recommendations on a nice travel tumbler for use on the car? I'd prefer a screw-on lid that flips - not the rubber gaskets with flimsy sliding ones, and black is also preferable.

I am fortunate tho in that I live and work just outside of the downtown metro area, which is the most blue area in my state. It's not uncommon to see pride flags in neighborhoods downtown, and we have a cultural neighborhood, part of which is known for belonging to the gays. So the vast majority of our customers aren't bothered by pride pins, bc most of them are commuters from downtown.

I work as a barista at a high volume coffee shop and the owners are totally ok with me wearing tons of pride pins on my apron. I've worn them for a year now, no issues.

But this month now we're getting customers every now and then who are emboldened to wear their MAGA hats. The hate is out loud and proud now. I've also noticed a sad number of Trump signs in yards in my neighborhood.

I'm struggling between taking off my work pins and the pride pins on my backpacks for personal safety reasons...or leaving them on as my own personal protest. I don't wear the trans pride flag specifically bc that one in particular would trigger someone to go nuts, that I'm sure of. I just wear rainbow pins and an MLM flag pin.

The only time I masc up and avoid wearing a lot of pins now is on dates with my partner, bc they are extremely visibly queer (facial hair, dresses, makeup, etc). And people have proven to be less inclined to say anything when I look like their standard hot topic merch boyfriend instead of a fem guy.

I have noticed more dirty looks from customers this week...but have also gotten more compliments about my pins than usual.

I think I am ultimately going to leave them on. I do pass as a cis male most of the time at this point, and I'm not a small-framed person. So I'm banking on that offering protection for me to keep wearing them without someone threatening me. I don't want to let the hateful people feel powerful, and I want them to know that they can't keep us invisible.

But most of all, I want every other queer person who sees my pins to feel supported.

It's still just shit that the threat is becoming so much more serious, whatever I eventually decide to do.",6,1731222183.0,FTMfemininity,0,0.88,False

Today she stopped replying back for some hours while we were setting up the details of the date, and an hour ago she asked if we can meet up at a restaurant instead, because ""it's closer to her home"" and she has other plans an hour and a half after we meet up.

That restaurant ain't cheap, it would be our first date and we would be with each other for about an hour, of which we would spent a good amount of it eating.

I got the feeling she basically told me ""feed me and then go away"". Even the worst and shortest date i've had lasted 2.5 hours, i already called off the date.

Help me dial in - Kitchenaid setup bought from UK to India

Hello guys,

I have a [kitchenaid grinder](https://www.kitchenaid.co.uk/coffee-machines/859711600730/coffee-grinder-artisan-5kcg8433-almond-cream?_gl=1*vjcis1*_up*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQiArby5BhCDARIsAIJvjISyGzUtIvOyWpXJ5F8tWJveTI2JLejAqh1ZNBgbkCWytrjg31nbWjgaAh_OEALw_wcB) and [espresso machine](https://www.kitchenaid.co.uk/coffee-machines/859711600690/espresso-machine-artisan-5kes6503-almond-cream?_gl=1*17yfar3*_up*MQ..&gclid=Cj0KCQiArby5BhCDARIsAIJvjISyGzUtIvOyWpXJ5F8tWJveTI2JLejAqh1ZNBgbkCWytrjg31nbWjgaAh_OEALw_wcB), bought from the UK
This is a decent machine. Comes with a nice tamper. One thing I liked about the Kitchenaid is the industry standard 58mm grouphead. I believe any accessory that can fit the Calphalon or GE machines will fit this as well. The major drawback of this machine is the lack of a 3-way solenoid valve. The residual pressure after shutting off the pump is quite excessive. I’ve measured the residual to be up to 10g. So let’s say you had a dose of 16g. Shutting the pump off at 32g and waiting for the coffee to stop dripping will result in 42g yield.

I prefer Iced lattes (whole milk, 2 shots)
No matter what I do, either it tastes muddy or bitter aftertaste- wasted tonnes of coffee beans (blue tokai india).

Can someone please help me dial in?
Do I need to buy anything additional as pre-requisite?

Many lifestyle changes, just need some positivity! Thanks!!","Hi update from a few weeks ago. Saw fertility specialist today with my fiancé. I am 35 had been a chronic marijuana user off and mostly on for years. Vaping usually. Healthy overall, gym five days a week play hockey, walk and hike. Try to eat reasonably healthy as well. Healthy weight.

Have been trying with fiancé for most of this year to get pregnant with no luck so far.

Had a sperm analysis take home kit from Walmart in June. Only measured numbers which was in ""normal range"" which I believe was above 15 million per ml.

Recently did a second more detailed analysis from a lab through her family doctor as I do not have one. Doctor called a few weeks back and didn't get into specifics but said low ish count, slow motility and some abnormal morphology. Advised us to fertility specialist. We had appt with her today.

She said my sperm was 10 million which is low but not super low as she measured 20 million typically, said my motility was 10 percent when normal is 50 and some abnormal sperm but didn't have a percentage.

I told her we had only abstained for 12 hours unfortunately as we were intimate the night before my SA (dumb I know). She said it could have effected the results for sure.

My partner and I have been having sex a tonnn over the last year. Usually daily sometimes twice a day on high days for her and might take 1-2 off days a week. She said every second day is better as it gives me time to recoup.

Since my not great SA 2.5 weeks ago I have been researching nonstop. My changes are as follows: I completely went cold Turkey on marijuana and have had none and will continue this. Limiting all alcohol even though I'm not a big drinker. Started taking coq10, vitamins e and c, b6 and b12, zinc, selenium, a daily multi, fish oil, and today I just bought some ashwaganda. Also limiting caffeine but not fully cutting it out as I am a shift worker and it's difficult for me. Trying to drink more green tea than just coffee.

The fertility specialist basically said we have some investigating to do but didn't sound too pessimistic. She recommended a procedure involving dye for my partner to check her tubes or flush them I think in the next couple months. And more blood work for us both. But basically recommended me take another SA soon after abstaining for 3 days and not 12 hours.

I am just looking for advice. Now that I have more information on my numbers, I am a bit worried about my motility. Hopefully my lifestyle changes and a longer abstinence period can help.

It was difficult for me to go weed free as it's helped my anxiety for years but it's a very small price to pay if it can help my numbers, especially motility. My parents are both in their 70s and I really want them to be able to see their grandkids.

We’ve been together for almost three years now and have been through a lot. Earlier in the relationship I cheated, but we have been working through it and for the most part are making progress. I am committed to him and I love him. I’m not sure if that bit of information will affect how you respond to my post.

A few months ago my partner met a woman out in a public establishment. I don’t remember how they ended up talking (I think she was at the next table over) but they share a unique background and they exchanged numbers. A month or so later, she was in the area and she called him to get coffee. Since that point they have met again for coffee and she has invited him to lunch (he didn’t go). She’s not always in his area but she has seen him or has tried to see him in some way at least 5 times since the first met. They text at least a few days a week (I think more often) about politics and also about the personal. They talk on the phone  and have met up to swap a certain kind of belonging. She offered to bring him food when his power went out. 

This is really bothering me. I don’t know how much they actually talk, how much they really get along, and what her feelings are. I do trust him but I feel like this crosses a boundary - it might be different if she were an old friend. And something that really bothers me is that he won’t tell me her last name.

What are your thoughts on this? Am I overreacting to feel super preoccupied and concerned about their blossoming friendship? I wish he would stop this contact but I don’t want to be controlling.",2,1731220598.0,AskWomenOver30,0,0.67,False

Hey, fellow wanderers! It's Derek here, aka u/solopassions, and I'm about to spill the tea on why solo travel is not just a trip but a transformative journey of a lifetime. 🌍✨

Picture this: me, setting foot in the cozy charm of White Fences Inn in Southampton, NY, with no one but my trusty carry-on and an insatiable curiosity for adventure. What followed was a string of epiphanies, unexpected encounters, and a few hilarious missteps that would make anyone consider packing their bags and heading for the unknown! 

**Unique Experiences? Oh, Let Me Tell You...**

As a solo traveler, I faced challenges that doubled as life lessons. There was the time I forgot to account for the Hamptons' tide charts and almost turned my beach day into an impromptu swimming lesson. 🌊 But hey, who knew? Not all heroes wear capes; some wear soaked clothes and a sheepish grin. 

Each mishap taught me to embrace spontaneity and resourcefulness—skills that turned solo travels into epic tales to share with you all.

**How Solo Travel Flipped My Perspective!**

Solo travel opened doors to self-discovery that I never knew existed. As I wandered through the historic charm of Southampton's streets, I learned the beauty of my own company and the power of navigating the world by just following my instincts. My solo adventures have redefined what independence means to me, making every step feel like I'm striding into a more self-assured version of myself.

**Tips for Aspiring Solo Adventurers:**

1. **Listen to Your Gut**: When you're alone, your instincts become your best travel companion. Trust that inner voice, whether it's leading you to a hidden local gem or steering you away from a sketchy alley.

2. **Stay Open and Flexible**: The beauty of solo travel is that you're on no one's schedule but your own. Let unexpected detours spark your itinerary—they often make the best stories!

3. **Find Comfort in Discomfort**: It's okay to feel out of place sometimes. It's those moments when you learn the most and grow out of your comfort zone.

4. **Document Your Journey**: Whether it's writing postcards to yourself (a personal favorite) or snapping candid shots, capture your solo adventures. You'll love revisiting those memories.

Remember, fellow travelers, you're never truly alone. The world is filled with stories ready to intertwine with yours if you just take that first step. So, who’s ready to embrace the solo traveler in them and discover a whole new world? Let's chat in the comments! What's your next solo escapade? 🌟
