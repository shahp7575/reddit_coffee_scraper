Recently however, she has been speaking about herself in a way that really does just frustrate me and I don't know how to approach it anymore. It mainly started at the beginning of the year when she said that she is going to get skinny as a new years resolution. I think she is a perfectly fine weight and I also didn't think she'd really commit to it because that is what everyone says at the beginning of the new year. Things only really began to bother me when she started making comments about my appearance as well. While I do weigh a notable amount less than her, my appearance is still a large insecurity of mine. She started making random comments about my nose size, and generally just about the way my features sit on my face. She also started becoming obsessed with ""mewing"". I initially thought all of this was some light teasing and her making a funny face every now and then it very quickly became very hurtful. We would be out getting coffee together and she would take a picture of us to put on her Instagram story. But then I would look at it later and see the caption says ""mogged"" and it'd just put a really bad taste in my mouth. It's getting more and more personal every day and the level of self obsession is getting to me. I understand this likely comes from a place of insecurity for her but she won't relent. I've tried bringing attention to it but it is always played off as me being sensitive or it just gets ignored. 

I really enjoy my time spent with her but when everything becomes hierarchical It makes me feel self conscious. I don't know how to approach this situation anymore and I just need advice on what is gonna make this stop. ",1,1746511892.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

## What is Nivexis Core GPT?

**Nivexis Core GPT** is an AI-powered trading platform that uses machine learning algorithms to analyze financial markets in real time and help users make smarter trades. Think of it like having a supercomputer that never sleeps, monitoring the markets 24/7, looking for profitable opportunities.

It reminds me a lot of platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**, which also use AI to automate parts of the trading process. While anonymity might raise eyebrows, the performance and transparency of the platform itself tend to matter more in the end.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Nivexis Core GPT Today](https://is.gd/Q2HZ9B)
## How Does Nivexis Core GPT Work?

At its core, Nivexis Core GPT uses **natural language processing (NLP)** and **machine learning** to scan massive amounts of market data. It tracks patterns, reads news, and interprets sentiment to forecast potential market movements. It’s like having a Wall Street analyst in your pocket—without the six-figure salary.

Users can choose between **manual trading** (where you make the final call) or **automated trading**, where the platform executes trades on your behalf based on pre-set strategies. This makes it flexible enough for both hands-on traders and those who prefer a more passive approach.

**Cons:**

The **minimum deposit** to start trading is **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category. The funds are used to activate your account and allow the AI to start making trades on your behalf.

I'm a long-term Vitality healthcare insurance holder and while it's expensive, I have previously recommended it.

Over the past month however they have made some bizarre alterations to their Rewards app - a way to reward policy holders based on their exercise.

We used to get 5 cinema tickets every month, a coffee every week and a couple of other perks. Not anymore, apparently...

Instead of this feedback rewards system they now basically give you a weird dog scratch card game every week. If you don't then jump through various new rules and timeframe restrictions you don't get the reward anyway.

Basically, it's now a game of luck that nobody cares about and I cannot believe how badly thought out it is.

## What is Fondmatex App?

Fondmatex App is an **automated trading platform** designed to help both beginners and experienced traders manage and execute trades. It uses a combination of **AI-driven algorithms** and real-time market data to make decisions on your behalf — kind of like a smart assistant that never sleeps.

What makes Fondmatex stand out is its **multi-asset support**. It’s not just for crypto nerds or Forex junkies. You can trade **cryptocurrencies, stocks, forex, and commodities** all in one place. That flexibility is a big win if you’re trying to diversify without juggling a bunch of different apps.

There’s also a **demo mode**, which I found super helpful when testing the waters before risking any real money. Not all platforms offer this, which is a shame because it’s such a simple but powerful tool for learning.

## Who Created Fondmatex App?

Information about the exact founders of Fondmatex is pretty limited — which, to be honest, is not uncommon in this space. Platforms like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge** are similar in that they operate more as tech-backed services than personality-driven startups.

What we do know is that Fondmatex was developed by a team with experience in **financial tech and AI-driven analytics**. The app itself feels like a product built by people who understand both the markets and the tech behind them — it’s clean, responsive, and doesn’t crash (unlike some of the buggy platforms I’ve tried).

While a little transparency would be nice, the platform’s performance and customer support do offer some reassurance in terms of legitimacy.

## How Does Fondmatex App Work?

At its core, Fondmatex uses **automated trading algorithms** that scan the market in real-time. It looks for profitable trade opportunities based on historical data, technical indicators, and market trends. You set your preferences (like risk level, trading limits, and assets you want to trade), and the system takes it from there.

Here’s the cool part: Fondmatex doesn’t just throw trades around like darts at a board. It uses **machine learning** to refine its strategies over time. So the more you use it, the more tailored your trading becomes.

You can also switch to **manual mode** if you want to take control. The app gives you the tools and data — so whether you’re a hands-off investor or a daily trader, it adapts to your style.

## Fondmatex App Pros and Cons

Let’s be real — no app is perfect. But here’s how Fondmatex stacks up:

### ✅ Pros

- **Automated trading with AI** – Saves time and reduces emotional decisions.
- **Supports multiple asset classes** – Trade crypto, stocks, forex, and commodities in one place.
- **Demo account available** – Practice before you commit any cash.
- **Mobile and desktop access** – Trade from anywhere.
- **Beginner-friendly** – Clean UI and easy onboarding.

### ❌ Cons

- **Limited transparency on founders** – Would be nice to know the team behind it.
- **Minimum deposit of $250** – Not unusual, but still a barrier for some.
- **Not available in the U.S. and Canada** – Regulatory stuff, unfortunately.

Fondmatex is accessible on pretty much any modern device. I tested it on:

You don’t need to download anything if you don’t want to. The **web-based interface** is responsive and works just as well as the mobile app — which is great if you prefer to trade from your laptop.

## Fondmatex App – Supported Countries

Fondmatex supports users from **most countries**, with a few exceptions due to regulatory restrictions. Here's a general breakdown:

### ✅ Supported Regions

- UK
- Australia
- South Africa
- Most of Europe
- Asia-Pacific

As always, check your local laws before signing up — you don’t want to get locked out mid-trade.

## Fondmatex App – Top Features

### Real-Time Market Analysis

One of the app’s strongest features is its **real-time market scanning**. It monitors charts, trends, and news 24/7 to find the best entry and exit points. This helps remove guesswork, especially if you’re not glued to the screen all day.

### User-Friendly Interface

The UI is clean and intuitive. Whether you're new to trading or a seasoned pro, you'll appreciate how everything is logically laid out. No clutter, no hidden settings — just straightforward design that works.

### Mobile Accessibility

Fondmatex’s mobile app is a standout. It’s fast, doesn’t crash, and gives you full access to trading tools. I’ve made trades while in line at the grocery store — it’s that efficient.

### Customizable Alerts

Set up **price alerts, volume spikes, or technical pattern triggers**. You can fine-tune these notifications so you only get pinged when it matters. No more meaningless alerts at 3am.

### Multiple Asset Trading

Having crypto, forex, stocks, and commodities all in one app is a *huge* win. It’s perfect for those of us who don’t want to juggle five apps just to check our portfolios.

## Is Fondmatex App a Scam?

Based on my testing and research — **no, it’s not a scam**. The platform functions as promised, withdrawals are processed within 48 hours, and customer support actually responds (which is more than I can say for some platforms).

That said, always be cautious when trading. No automated system is perfect, and losses are still possible. Start small, use the demo account, and never invest more than you’re willing to lose.

## What is the Minimum Deposit Required on Fondmatex App?

The minimum deposit is **$250**. This is pretty standard for platforms in this category (Bitcoin Era and Immediate Edge also use the same amount).

You can fund your account using:

- Credit/Debit cards
- Bank transfer
- E-wallets (varies by region)

Once you deposit, you can start trading with real funds or continue practicing with the demo.

### Fondmatex App Customer Support

Customer support is available **24/7** via:

- **Live Chat** – Fast responses, usually under 5 minutes
- **Email** – Great for complex issues
- **Phone (in select countries)** – Helpful if you need a human voice

The agents were knowledgeable and didn’t just copy/paste canned responses. Always a good sign.

## How do you start trading on Fondmatex App?

### Step 1: Sign Up for a Free Account

Go to the Fondmatex website and fill out the registration form. Just your name, email, and phone number. No crazy paperwork.

### Step 2: Verify and Fund Your Account

You’ll need to verify your identity (standard KYC stuff). Once that’s done, make your first deposit of $250 to unlock live trading.

### Step 3: Start Trading

You can either let the AI handle everything or switch to manual mode. I recommend trying the **demo account first** to test different strategies before risking real funds.

## How to Delete a Fondmatex App Account?

If you ever want to peace out, deleting your account is easy:

- Go to **Account Settings**
- Click on **Delete Account**
- Confirm via email verification

You can also contact support to assist with deletion if needed.

## The Verdict

Fondmatex App is a **solid trading platform** that balances automation and customization pretty well. It’s beginner-friendly but still offers enough tools for more advanced traders. The multi-asset support and smart AI tools are the real game-changers here.

It’s not perfect — I’d love more transparency about the team behind it, and the $250 deposit might scare off some folks. But overall, if you’re looking for a reliable, easy-to-use platform that doesn’t feel like a scammy cash grab, **Fondmatex is worth checking out**.

I (32 FTM) am 5dpo from a laproscopic robotic assisted hysterectomy that took out everything but my ovaries and I'm surprised by how easy this recovery has been. I was having weekly cramping and abnormal bleeding that birth control and testosterone didn't fix. After being told my options were an IUD that may or may not work or surgery I said let's just go for surgery because I don't want to keep dealing with it anymore. I told my surgeon when she called to check in on day 1 that I had had worse periods than this and the weekly cramping was far worse than the cramps I was feeling. After 3dpo I stopped bleeding completely. Today I even went out for coffee and lunch. Albeit I still spend most of my time laying down because I feel drained but I did just have surgery after all. 

Anyways on to my question. I feel a weird pressure? right at my pelvis. It seems to ease when I pee, pass gas, or have a bowel movement but then builds again. It's exactly where my uterus used to sit. Pain meds take the pain of the pressure away but it still fills like there's something there. Does that feeling settle? Is it just my organs slowly finding their new home? Just gas pains? It's not exactly painful it's just weird and I feel a bit silly that I can't tell if I need to pee, pass gas, poop, or take pain meds.

Also I'm having weird face flushing. I kept both of my ovaries and I'm on testosterone so in theory it shouldn't be hormonal but I'm not sure if hormones fluctuate any while things settle. I've also read maybe anesthesia can cause hot flashes or body temperature regulation issues? Not sure if that's actually founded or not though.",1,1746510899.0,hysterectomy,0,1.0,False

The place I order from, Sweet Fern, I highly HIGHLY recommend if you're in Australia and looking for niche/indie brands - the owner is so lovely and communicative, and shipping is incredibly fast, I think I ordered yesterday and it arrived today!! Both times I've ordered a 6-sample set, they've sent me a whole second set of free samples.

I've just gone through a blotter test of all my new samples. I've found Pineward pretty consistent between skin and paper, but I'll do a more thorough review later on once I've tried them all on skin - I'm just too excited to not share at this stage! Pineward can do no wrong in my eyes, but this was a *particularly* successful haul, I must say.

**INSTANT LOVES**

**Akero**

This was one of the freebies, and I would never have picked it out myself because I didn't think I would like an apple fragrance (or fruity fragrances in general...but as I'm beginning to discover, I'm wrong about that). Because I don't really eat apples, my initial thought when I smelled the greenness in this was ""kiwi fruit?!"" because I eat those far more often. But when I checked the notes and saw green apple I immediately recognised what I was smelling. This is the most perfect, the most *divine*, euphorically beautiful photorealistic green apple I have ever smelled. And I say this as someone who finds apples kind of boring. Words really don't do it justice.

**Gingermoss**

I looove this scent profile. There's a strong white floral aspect from orange blossom and woodiness as well. Complex, fresh, bright, floral/herbal-soapy. It smells healing, a bit medicinal, reminds me of health food stores and garden centers equally. 

**Noki**

This was an immediate blast of sugar, which is normally a red flag for me as a sweet-fragrance disliker, but THIS is like the best sugar I've ever smelled. It's lychee with Pineward complexity and woodiness and none of the sharpness or acidity lychee can have.

**Hayloft**

Similar to my beloved Pastoral, but with an added wheat/grain note that makes this so cosy and comforting. (Makes me think Pineward could do a really good bread fragrance)

**Clemenpine**

So complex and not what I was expecting at all from the name! I don't feel a strong citrus aspect, it's too well blended to pick anything out but my first thought was ""this smells like a Serge Lutens!"" and then I thought it might Chergui specifically I'm reminded of, even though the scent profile is quite different (much lighter and fresher, less sweet, more woody). There is for sure tobacco and suede.

**EVERYTHING ELSE, in no particular order**

**Treacle**

Dense, sticky, kinda boozy resin that reminds me of sniffing pure vanilla essence initially. Becomes slightly smoky from lapsang souchong. Similar to Velvetine, but without the animalic aspect. Very cosy! Log cabin sitting by the fire vibes.

**Caravansary**

Very strong, dark, fruity pine with a sharp green aspect - extremely Christmassy, and reminds me of a more refined, less sweet version of Damask Haus' Goblin Market.

**Bucolic**

Starts out a little hay-like, quite fresh and almost a little fruity (I was reminded of Pastoral), develops a more animalic quality as it dries down (similar to the animalic note in Velvetine) but it's very light and inoffensive. Not a scary animalic at all.

**Subalpine**

VERY woody and VERY bitter-green. A classic Pineward forest scent, on the fresher and lighter side, elevated by bergamot.

**Katabatic**

Very complex and hard to describe! Started off very woody, a little boozy, and a little spicy. There's amaretto in the notes and I did start to smell almonds. It's become quite fresh in the drydown - I'm getting a lot of mint, with a backdrop of woody spices that remind me of a classic masculine aftershave. I love the way Pineward blends mint.

**Coffee Tabac**

Resinous, quite sweet, and similar to Mint Cocoa with its woodiness. Coffee isn't super dominant, though it comes out more in the drydown. I was hoping for more coffee in this but it's still really good.

**Gelatto**

This is the only one I'm not sure I like. It's mostly keffir lime, with a white floral background, very clean fresh and summery (doesn't feel gourmand to me), but there's something else that smells like paper and gives me a weird dusty feeling in the back of my throat when I smell it, which is putting me off. Might be the massoia bark? (I don't know what that smells like) If it wasn't for that note, I would still really like this.

Our wedding is a month away and I’m in a bit of a dilemma. Earlier in our planning, we booked a coffee cart + grazing wall package worth Php22,500 from a local supplier. We already paid 50% dp (Php11,250), but we don’t have a signed contract — just receipts and messages.

Recently, my favorite local café reached out and asked if we had chosen a coffee cart supplier. We didn’t commit to them before, but the truth is… I really want them now 🥲 I’ve always loved their coffee and I think it would feel extra special to have them at the wedding.

So now I’m thinking of cancelling just the coffee cart from our original supplier and retaining only the grazing wall, which is Php10k based on their rates (plus Php2.5k transpo). I’m planning to message them and offer to settle the remaining Php1,250 to complete the Php12,500 instead of the full Php22,500.

We still want to support their business — I just don’t want to lose the chance to work with the café I really love. But I feel guilty about the short notice and I’m scared they’ll get mad or not agree to the arrangement.

Anyone else experienced something similar? Is it reasonable to do this a month before the wedding? Would love advice on how to handle it kindly but assertively.

It’s my 40th birthday coming up, I also love coffee, and as such was looking at treating myself to some Hasami pieces. I love their minimalist aesthetic and their highly functional and textured nature. 

Having done a ton of research, I’ve landed on picking up 2 mugs + the triangle tray + milk pitcher, however, I’m unsure whether to go for small mug or medium mug. Whilst various websites say the small mug’s ‘actual drinking capacity’ is 8oz (~225ml) and medium is 12oz (~350ml), is anyone able to enlighten me as to whether it holds that amount of liquid comfortably (i.e. helpful) or if that is full to the brim (i.e. unhelpful)?

I often drink pourover coffee using a recipe that uses 250g of water, so keen for any mug to allow me to sip a full cup in enjoyment without needing to refill half way through.

This is a long one so I've had to split it into multiple posts. TL;DR at the end. This was requested a few months back- thanks u/Jorgenstern8 and u/Fi72 for the request/info to locate this. I've attempted to contact OP since then but no response and I can't see any account activity for a year so I'm plowing ahead...

Note: I've taken out some unrelated info and repetitive TL;DRs in order to streamline this post- everything else is OP's own.

# [Original post (3 Oct 2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/55q65a/mil_in_the_wild_youre_such_a_bad_little_girl_see/)

So this happened earlier today over  the course of about 3-4mins, some relevant background; I broke my ankle  and a few toes (on opposite feet) weeks ago, my cast was removed 3 weeks  ago so I’m mobile and now down to using  one crutch, mostly for  balance.

This has meant that my  brother has been chauffeuring me around everywhere, including to and  from work. He was running late today so I wobbled my way down to a  supermarket to grab milk etc and told him to pick me up outside the  store at the little pick up/drop off point by the entrance.

So  I was sitting on the bench outside the store when a wild MIL appeared,  with her DIL and grandkid. I’m not sure how old the kid was, I’m no good  at judging kids ages, but based on her stream of babbling, I don’t  think she could speak just yet. She was sitting in the little chair  thing in the trolley and seemed to be quite happy. MIL was an older  woman who was walking slowly but seemed to be fine.

DIL  parked the trolley and kid beside me and told MIL to wait here; she’ll  go get the car so MIL didn’t have to walk across the car park. From what  I got from the conversation; MIL had been moaning about her feet and  wanted to sit down. DIL was trying to get her to sit on the bench and  MIL was martyring herself. I promptly put a stop to all of that by  offering the MIL my dry part of the bench and moving further away to  lean against the wall. MIL didn’t even look at me before sitting down  like she’d just been crowned.

DIL  kissed the kid, told her “mummy will be back in a moment, you be good  for Granny and then we’ll go for a fun ride in the car”. Kid’s happy and  excited for car ride, mum disappears.

As  soon as DIL was out of earshot the MIL tuned to the kid and said  “You’re such a bad little girl. See, mummy’s leaving you here. She’s  gone without you. No car for you”. Cue kid bursting into tears and *screaming*  for her mum. I’m not sure how much the kid understood of what the MIL  had said, it may have been all or she could have just understood the “no  car” part, either way it was a shitty thing to say to your grandchild  (or any child tbh).

I looked right  at her and gave her the raised eyebrow look and some serious glaring,  which probably gave away the fact that I’d heard her. She completely  changed her tune, loudly telling the kid that she was “only joking” and  “mummy will be right back” etc.

This  didn’t really have much effect on the kid and she was working herself  into a right state, so the MIL decided to take her out of the trolley  seat.

She plonked the screaming kid on her feet then *turned back to sit on the bench*.  Guys, this kid could have given Usain Bolt a run for his money. The  moment she had her (not particularly stable) balance she made a run for  it screaming for her mummy.

Straight towards the road.

There  was about 15ft between the road and me (still leaning against the wall)  and about half that between the kid and the road. In the time it took  for me to realise the kid was heading for the road and that MIL hadn’t  seen a thing, the kid had made it pass the bollard (there are bollards  outside shops in the UK, I’m not sure why but I have theories).

I have *never*  moved so fast in my life, I managed to grab the kid and make it back to  the pavement before my ankle realised that a full sprint this soon was *soo*  not a good idea. Neither of my legs were interested in supporting me  after that so I just sort of crumpled into a heap on the pavement with  this kid.

The next thing I know the DIL is there taking the kid from me, it was her car that she’d run in front of.

DIL was crying, the kid was crying, I was crying (it fucking hurt) and MIL was *still* sitting on the bench.

Anyway, I blame it on the adrenaline/pain because normally I wouldn’t get involved but I told the DIL *exactly* what had happened, all of it, even what MIL had said to the kid. When I left DIL was still screaming at her MIL.

Firstly, the ankle, it’s sore,  swollen and bruised but thankfully NOT re-broken. Dr says it’s badly  sprained and will set my recovery back, but I don’t need to go back in  the cast (yay!!).

So, because I  had an appointment with my physio this morning I decided wait for that  instead of heading to A&E last night. Long story short, my physio  was convinced my ankle had re-broken and sent me up to x-ray (physio  department is in the hospital). A nurse/porter (I’m not sure what she  was) stuck me in a wheelchair to take me and we got chatting:

>Nurse: So how did you manage to hurt yourself this time around?  
>  
>Me: Oh, I chased after a kid that ran into traffic.  
>  
>Nurse: My god, how did that happen? When was this?  
>  
>Me: Yesterday, \[gets ready to tell the story\]  
>  
>Nurse: Wait...was this at \[supermarket at address\]?  
>  
>Me: Yeeeeaaahhhh???  
>  
>Nurse: OH MY GOD, THAT WAS MY NEICE!!!

The MIL is her MOTHER!!!

Apparently  her SIL (so the DIL from yesterday) took off and left her MIL (the  nurses Mother) at the store yesterday. She’s pretty sure her brother and  her SIL are now NC as her SIL has been pushing for NC but her brother  (DILs husband) is a “mummysboy” and had been reluctant.

She’s already NC with her mother after she caught her intentionally PINCHING HER NEWBORN.

She also told me that her niece is fine, but her SIL got a big fright.

So  there you go, it’s a damn small world. I had a hundred questions for  her but thought that might be a bit rude. I’m not sure if I’ll run into  her again, it wasn’t really clear where in the hospital she worked or  what she actually does but you never know.

# [Update 2 (11 Oct 2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/56z0bq/mil_in_the_wild_youre_sure_a_bad_little_girl/)

I really didn’t expect to have an update for this again, I was pretty sure it was all over.

I was wrong.

I  had another physio appointment today and ran into the kid’s aunt again,  it turns out she’s training to be a physio so I’ll probably see her a  lot. After my appointment she asked if she could talk to me, so we had a  sit down and a chat.

Turns out Insane Granny has gone *completely* bananas.

She’s  apparently got enough sense about her to realise that the kid’s Mum now  has a damn good reason to go NC along with the kid and could now  probably convince her husband (kid’s Dad) to go NC too. So, knowing she  is probably about to be cut off, she made a pre-emptive strike against  the kid’s Mum and Dad.

She called the Police and told them about the incident in my original post, except she completely changed the story.

According  to her, the kid’s Mum was being mean and neglectful to the kid and  Insane Granny called her out on it, which evolved into an argument.  While they were arguing the kid ran off into the road, Insane Granny  noticed and ran after her. The kid’s Mum then snatched the kid from  Granny and left Granny at the store. No mention of me.

Based  on how quickly things have moved, they think that Insane Granny told  the police this story on the day of the incident, if not the day after.  I’m not sure what the rules are around the world but here, in Scotland,  the police have to investigate and they also have to inform Social  Services, who then have to do an initial assessment (talking to the  kid’s school, Dr, etc). Basically there are a few compulsory boxes to be  ticket before deciding whether or not to carry out a more in-depth  investigation and there isn’t much you can do to stop it.

So  the police dropped into visit the kid’s Mum and Dad last Thursday. The  kid’s Mum told her version of events but couldn’t really give much  specifics as she wasn’t really there (she only really knew what I’d told  her). So the Police (and presumably Social Services) now have two  conflicting reports, one of which claims the involvement of a third  party, me. The next day they received notice that Social Services would  be in touch.

This has all lit a fire under the kid’s Dad’s ass and he confronted Insane Granny, the highlights (told to me at least) include:

* Her end game is to get custody of the kid
* She hopes the kid’s Mum will be jailed
* She  admitted to lying to the Police but is confident the kid’s Mum can’t  prove what actually happened because there’s no way she’d be able to  find me to corroborate.

The  kid’s aunt was told all this over the weekend and while everyone seems  to be sure that both the Police and Social Services won’t find any  problems, they’re understandably nervous. The aunt didn’t tell the kid’s  Mum and Dad that she’d met me in the hospital for two reasons; she  didn’t actually have my permission to do so and definitely didn’t have  my permission to give out my contact details.

Basically  the aunt asked if I’d be willing to give my side of the story to the  Police and Social Services and could the kid’s parents contact me. I’ve  agreed and the aunt is going to pass everything on to the kid’s parents.  Chances are they won’t need me to do anything but you never know. I  also pointed out that the security cameras for the store would’ve caught  everything and that will probably be the Police’s first stop.

Sooooo the drama continues.

# [Update 3 (16 Oct 2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/57rsa5/mil_in_the_wild_youre_sure_a_bad_little_girl/)

So things have gotten...interesting.

The  kid’s Mum contacted me and we met up for coffee yesterday. She’s a  really nice lady who is under a lot of stress. I told her about [r/JUSTNOMIL](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/) and she *said*  she’d have a browse, though I have no idea if she was just being polite  or not. She ended up a bit of a ranting mess but I don’t blame her to  be honest. She did clear up a few things though; the big one being that  the Insane Granny didn’t call the Police, she called a friend of hers  who works in the Social Services.

Insane  Granny gave this Social Services Friend her version of events and the  friend officially reported the kid’s Mum. That’s how the Police became  involved; Social Services contacted them as they (most likely  spearheaded by the Social Services Friend, though this is speculation on  the kid’s parent’s part) believed the kid to be in immediate danger.  The Police have found that the kid is in no immediate danger but they’re  still investigating what happened at the store. I’m going to give them  my statement at some point next week and that should hopefully be the  end of it.

Social Service on the  other hand is a totally different can of worms. Regardless of how they  got involved they still have to do an initial assessment and will also  be investigating the incident at the store. From what the kid’s Mum told  me Insane Granny’s Social Service friend is either pushing everything  or is actually in charge of the investigation.

So  far the Social Service Friend has mostly being doing her job (though  rather invasively) she’s allowed to speak to all of the kid’s parent’s  neighbours, co-workers, the kid’s school and the kid’s doctor. What she  isn’t allowed to do is show up at the kid’s parents house *with Insane Granny* to try to force a reconciliation.

Apparently Insane Granny *really*  went for it with the manipulation and gaslighting in front of the  Social Services Friend, she seems to be trying to make the kids Mum look  like the insane one, between bouts of fake crying she;

* Acted  concerned about the kid’s Mum’s mental state saying she must be  hallucinating because she is remembering the incident ‘wrong’.
* Said that the kid should be placed in her (Insane Granny’s) care until ‘all this nonsense’ is sorted.
* Asked  her son (the kid’s Dad) how the divorce proceedings are going (they are  not divorcing she was trying to make it look like they are to her  friend).
* Told  the kid’s Mum that she was glad she was feeling well enough to clean  the house and asked her if she’d managed to feed the kid today.

When  the parents pulled out their trump card, the fact that Aunt is (and now  they’re) in contact with me, she started fake crying and asking why  Aunt and kid’s Mum are lying to everyone. That the kid’s Mum had dragged  Aunt into her delusion and that she (the kid’s Mum) needs help. Then  she turned to the Social Services Friend and told her that Aunt and  kid’s Mum must be “paying some poor homeless girl or student to lie for  her” (I totally called that btw, I *knew* she was going to accuse me of lying or something similar).

At this point the kid’s Mum admits she lost it at Insane Granny and was screaming at her to leave.

This  was convincing enough for the Social Service Friend (and apparently the  kid’s Dad) to suggest to the kid’s Dad that he might want to have the  kid’s Mum sectioned (committed to a psychiatric facility).

Once  the Social Service Friend and Insane Granny left, the kid’s parents  argued. The gist of it being that the kid’s Dad was sort of taken in by  his mother’s (Insane Granny’s) claims. She didn’t tell me much about  that just that he’s sleeping in the guest room now. I offered to speak  to him but she (rightly I suppose) thinks he should trust her without  outside input.

I’ve advised her to  contact Social Services herself and give them my contact information so  there is an official paper trail and Insane Granny’s Social Worker  Friend can’t claim she didn’t know anything about me. I’ve also told her  to make a complaint about Social Service’s Friend but she’s nervous  that doing so right now would make things worse.

So  that’s where we are right now. I doubt they’ll be much to update about  once I speak to Social Services and the Police but the kid’s parents are  going to keep me in the loop so if there is anymore drama (please don’t  let there be more drama) I’ll update again.

Edit: I just want to clear up something that I realise I didn't make particularly clear in this post. The kid's Mum *will definitely be reporting the Social Services Friend*.  We know what she is doing is illegal, she's just nervous that reporting  right now will make things worse. I know it won't, YOU know it won't  and she *does* know that it won't  but so far EVERYONE has turned against her so I don't blame her for  feeling this way. I will however talk to her again about reporting her  now.

I also missed out from this  post the fact that I mentioned to her about getting a Solicitor. She  never really gave me a straight answer regarding that issue but she's at  least aware she should get legal help.

# [Update 4 (17 Oct 2016)](https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/57zpvi/mil_in_the_wild_youre_sure_a_bad_little_girl/)

I’d asked the kid’s mum if she wanted  me to go and make a statement to the Police or just wait until Social  Services contact me. She wanted me to go to the Police as she’s trying  to get an Interdict Order (essentially a Restraining Order) against  Insane Granny.

So I went to give  my statement to the Police and oh boy has Insane Granny done a number on  them. After the kid’s parents told her that they were in contact with  me she *went to the Police* and  told them that I might come in claiming to have been involved in the  original store incident. She’s managed to weave some intricate lie  essentially trying to discredit me before I gave evidence. This worked,  to a certain extent.

The Officer  in charge of the case made it very clear he thought I was lying and had  been paid off (he asked me a few times how much I was making doing this  and told me I could be arrested for wasting Police time and perjury) he  was immediately dismissive of me and condescending. Which, I’m ashamed  to say, I don’t respond very well to. I mentioned in a comment on one of  my previous posts that I work in Forensics and I’ve been an expert  witness (both educational and reporting). Implying that I could be  accepting bribes or am lying could potentially kill my career. No way am  I endangering my career because some manipulative old lady has an  Officer wrapped around her gnarly old witch finger.

Unfortunately  I have worked with more than my fair share of people who take one look  at me and think I’m some sort of inexperienced, daft bimbo. I usually  try to assert myself and if that doesn’t work, let them embarrass  themselves, it happens eventually.

In  this case it happened at the end of the interview when he asked me for  my employment details. My official job title sounds way more important  than it is (it has the words ‘Lead’, ‘Investigator’, ‘Forensic’ and a  few other ones in there that make me sound impressive). This definitely  made him sit up and listen.

I’m  not gonna lie I kinda chewed him out a bit (though he mostly realised  himself that he’d fucked up) he’d allowed himself to be completely  manipulated by Insane Granny and I pointed out that it’s pure luck that  what I do for a living comes with a lot of credibility. What would have  happened if I *had* been some poor student or someone uncomfortable in this type of situation or heck, anyone else.

So  I set the record straight about Insane Granny, well, what I know to be  fact. I also filled him in off the record about what Aunt and the kid’s  Mum told me (which I obviously can’t prove). So we had a chat and I got a  few things straightened out. One of which was that Insane Granny *did*  in fact contact the Police after the incident at the store. I was  originally told that she contacted the Police who contacted Social  Services, *then* I was told that  this wasn’t true, instead Insane Granny had contacted her Social  Services Friend who reported the incident and somehow got the Police  involved (it was unclear how).

So  we think (complete speculation on my and the Police’s part here by the  way) that once Insane Granny made her report to the Police and they said  that they’d be contacting Social Services, Insane Granny took it upon  herself to contact her Social Services Friend. So we definitely know  that Social Services Friend is *not* officially involved (a few of you who work in Social Services pretty much said the same thing).

Insane Granny and Social Services Friend are basically a rogue duo going around town trying to get dirt on the kid’s Mum.

I’ve  reported her (I’ve told the kid’s Mum this too) and the Police are now  aware of her, though whether they just let Social Services deal with her  or get themselves involved I don’t know yet.

The  Officer also told me some of the things Insane Granny has claimed about  me. Now before anyone loses their shit about him breaking  confidentiality, etc, he never actually gave me her side of the story or  told me what she said in her statement (I got that from the kid’s  Aunt). All he told me was what she said when she came into ‘warn’ him  I’d be making a ‘fake’ Police report.

So she’s claimed *to the Police,* that I, someone she knows absolutely nothing about and met for less than 5mins am:

* A poor student desperate for money
* I have a history of lying to the Police; she knows this because apparently I’m friends with the kid’s Mums drug addict cousin
* I might be a drug addict she doesn’t know
* I once tried to seduce her son, the kid’s Dad (which is impressive as I’ve never met the guy before)

Unfortunately I gave him all my whats so I don’t have any to spare for you.

I  also asked about the security cameras outside the store, they didn’t  manage to get anything from them as they’re aimed at the door not the  pick-up area (I did have a look on the way in and thought it might be a  long shot).

So what’s still to happen?

* The kids parents will have an official Social Services visit sometime soon
* Social Services will most like want to talk to me
* The Police will be going after Insane Granny for wasting Police time/filing a false Police report.
* There will hopefully be a follow up to my complaint about Social Service Friend

I  don’t think you’ll need your drama  llamas for this update, more likely  you’ll need  you’re....perplexed....alpacas(?). Anyway it’s more weird  than dramatic.

As  some of you  know, because of the state of my ankle, I’ve been staying  with my  parents and younger brother for the last few months. Well on  Monday, my  Mum had the day off and was puttering around the house. My  parents  place is in a very rural area of Scotland; our closest neighbour  is 6  miles away and our house is at the end of what is essentially a  mile  long dirt/tractor track. It’s hard to find and the only strangers  we  get out here are either forestry people who missed the forest access   road or one or two brave (or quite possibly lost) Jehovah Witnesses.   Google Maps and SatNavs can’t find it and no one delivers out here   except the Royal Mail.

At around   noon a car pulled up, however no one got out. This isn’t too unusual, as   I said, it’s usually someone lost. So she hung around at the front of   the house in case they came over to ask directions; instead after a few   minutes, the car left. About an hour later; same car pulls up and the   same thing happens again.

Another   hour goes by and they’re back again, only this time two women exited  the  car. They didn’t go to the door; instead they decided to have a  little  snoop around. One tried to go around the back of the house which  is  currently fenced off as our back garden is being used as a paddock  for a  pregnant mare and her foal. The other started trying to look in  the  windows, so my Mum goes out and asks if she could help them. They  very  quickly say no, they were just looking before booking it back to  their  car and speeding off.

Naturally,   my Mum was confused enough to tell and my Dad, brother and I what   happened pretty much as soon as we got home. I’ve definitely been   working in Forensics too long as my immediate reaction was that they   were casing the place.

Now, we   have security cameras. They’re not for the house or security; they were   originally set-up around our back garden so we could watch for when the   mare went into labour. They were never removed because the foal turned   out to be the reincarnation of Houdini and then we had the mare  covered  again.

One of the cameras  is aimed  at the gate that one of the women tried to open to get into  the back  garden. So we had a little look at the footage;

Can you guess who was trying to open that gate?

Yep, Insane Granny was at my parents place.

I   have no idea who her friend was; what they wanted or why they didn’t   talk to my Mum and I can only assume she got this address from the kids   parents (my money is on the Dad). My Mum had today off work as well but   she said no one turned up. However, I have a day off tomorrow and  apart  from my brother being about in the morning, I’ll be home alone.

I   know many of you will suggest calling the police for either harassment   or trespassing (or both) but in Scotland, trespassing is a civil  matter  not a criminal one so they can’t get involved. There are laws  regarding  trespassing but they’re mostly to do with squatting and  Scotland has a  lot of Public Access Laws which essentially let people  go where ever  they want in regards to the rural areas.

The   stalking and harassment Laws require two related incidents and must   pass the “reasonable person” test (if the average person on the street   was subject to this behaviour would they feel   threaten/alarmed/distressed, if not then there was no offense). The   offender must also be aware that what they are doing is causing   alarm/distress. For example; if your MIL wants access to your kids and   keeps coming around to your house to complain every night for a   fortnight. You become fed up and begin to feel distressed about your   MIL’s constant visits. Your MIL is aware that her behaviour will cause   you distress and is hoping to wear you down into letting her see your   kids.

I’m not particularly   worried; even with my leg I’m pretty sure I could take her and my   brother has graciously let me borrow ‘Bernard’ his old Shinty stick with   a kitchen knife duct taped to it (when I first broke my ankle I also   gave myself a head injury, my brother and I spent that night and the   next day binge watching The Walking Dead and I think he freaked himself   out as 2 days later ‘Bernard’ appeared).

It’s too close to Halloween for this shit.

Edit:  Ok, the general view is that I should contact the Police about  this.  I'm planning to call both Social Services and the Police tomorrow,  I  doubt the Police will do anything but as everyone has pointed out, at   the very least it'll be documented. I've also texted the kid's Mum but i   haven't heard back yet

**Once again, I am not OP.**

**Midpoint TL;DR-** **OP saves a child from running into traffic after being bullied and released by Granny. Granny gives false police report to get custody of said child. OP has chance encounter with child's aunt and offers to be a witness. Granny goes to police station first and lies about OP. Luckily resolved due to OP's profession- forensics, alongside the police. Granny then turns up at OP's home.**

I did not expect much difference other than no dripping in an upright brew. But it was incredible:  

1.  Easier to press, which was a surprise. I expected it would be harder. 
2.  No leaking into the cup
3.  It “growled” through the entire press, but that helped me hear what was going on since I don’t have a clear press and it’s hard to see through it. 
4.  The texture was different. The brew seemed to have more “body” and lots of “psuedo crema”—1/2 an inch!  The psuedo crema didn’t melt away, either. 
5.  Great flavor!

I used my usual medium fine espresso grind (I buy pre-ground because I don’t have a grinder available) and my usual espresso-like recipe (18 g coffee, 60 g boiling water, stir for 30 seconds, press) for a latte. 

One con:  the puck didn’t stay together. Some stuck to the plunger. 

Another surprise: it is ever so slightly more narrow than the original filter cup. Less than 2 mm more narrow in diameter at the cup’s edge—slightly more than 1 mm. It’s just enough to fit the top of my favorite cup without rocking like the original filter cap does.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Building your forever home is an exciting journey, and single story barndominium floor plans can be your perfect path to achieving that dream. These distinctive homes blend rustic charm with modern features, offering various benefits for homeowners. Below, we explore how these floor plans can transform your living experience.

One of the standout features of single story barndominiums is their spaciousness. Unlike traditional homes, these floor plans boast open-concept designs that emphasize airflow and light. High ceilings and large windows create a sense of freedom and space, making every square foot feel welcoming. This design allows for flexibility in your living area, enabling you to arrange furniture and create spaces that suit your lifestyle.

Another significant advantage is accessibility. With everything nestled on one level, single story barndominiums eliminate the barriers of stairs.

Easy navigation throughout the house adds convenience, making everyday tasks simpler and safer for everyone.

When you envision your forever home, energy efficiency is likely at the forefront of your mind. Single story barndominiums typically use fewer materials than multi-story options, which can lead to lower construction and utility costs. The open floor plans tend to have better airflow, potentially reducing heating and cooling expenses. Choosing sustainable materials can also enhance energy efficiency and contribute to your green living goals.

The versatility of single story barndominium floor plans cannot be overstated. They can be customized to suit any lifestyle, whether you need a spacious kitchen for entertaining, a home office, or even a hobby room. You can mix function and style with the flexibility to expand or modify spaces as your needs change over time. Here are a few versatile layout ideas:

- **Split Layouts:** Separate living and sleeping areas provide privacy for family members or guests.
- **Open Kitchen and Living Spaces:** Combining rooms encourages entertaining and family gatherings.
- **Multi-Purpose Rooms:** Craft a space that can be utilized for work, leisure, or additional sleeping accommodations.

Additionally, single story barndominiums often feature durable materials that stand up to wear and tear. Steel frames and metal roofs, common in barndominium designs, ensure longevity and low maintenance. The exterior can be personalized with a range of finishes, from wood to metal, and style preferences, meeting your vision while providing protection against the elements.

Designing your forever home should reflect your unique style, and single story barndominiums do just that. They provide a blank canvas where you can implement your creative ideas, whether you prefer a modern, rustic vibe or a warm country feel. From chic lighting to custom cabinetry, your choices will enhance your aesthetics while ensuring functionality.

Outdoor spaces is another benefit of single story barndominium floor plans. Many designs feature large porches or patios that blend the indoors with the outdoors, allowing you to savor nature right outside your door. Imagine hosting summer barbecues on your spacious patio or sipping morning coffee under the shade of a covered porch—these moments are possible with a well-planned barndominium.

It's essential to consider the community aspect. Barndominiums often sit on larger plots of land, providing ample space for gardens, recreational areas, or even additional structures. This openness not only fosters a sense of privacy but also enhances neighborly interactions, allowing you to create a close-knit community feel.

Choosing a single story barndominium floor plan can be more than just about selecting a house—it’s about crafting a lifestyle.

1kfx365,https://www.reddit.com/r/horror/comments/1kfx365/watched_the_coffee_table/,Watched “the coffee table”,"I thought it was a neat little film. It’s definitely a black comedy, but the subject matter is so intense that I think it’s probably going to overshadow the comedic elements for a lot of people. 

What I really like about it is that it feels extremely realistic. Instead of adding absurd moments to a tragic situation it finds ways to be comedic in ways that feel plausible with what’s happening. 

The only big critique I have is the ending. It doesn’t give enough to provide an impactful resolution, and it isn’t abrupt enough to be jarring. It really does feel like someone said: “okay, we’ve got 10 minutes, let’s wrap this up” 

The movie triumphs in its simplicity, you really think something totally out of left field is going to happen, but any of that would alleviate the pressure the movie creates with its initial problem. 

I recommend it! ",22,1746509971.0,horror,16,1.0,False
1kfx1xb,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1kfx1xb/red_flags/,Red flags,"So this happened almost 12 years ago. But some things are too ridiculous. And I have used this relationship as a way to help others to see the red flags. 
And many trigger warnings. I tried to stay away from details as much as possible. 

So at the time I was 24. I was a very wild 20 something. I was child free. Had an amazing paying job. I had no rent no bills except for my phone bill and a very social butterfly. I would also Jump from quick relationship to quick relationship. I never had anything long term. My longest was six months… but it was an on and off again. I had just officially ended it with him and had been in a relationship with my then boyfriend Troy (22). This does come back into play.

At my job, my coworker had a son (33) Da (DumbA because that is what the people in my life call him.), that came around nearly daily. He was a flirt. He hit on all the woman there. I'd shoot him down at his every attempt. Which made him try harder. Oh did I mention he was married? And had one kid and a pregnant wife. Red flag number one. 

One day Troy and I were having a fight over the phone while I was on break. Da and his mother (Karen) were there listening. I end up telling Troy I deserved better than being a second choice of a 45 year old woman…. Yes Troy's ex was 45. And I could and did deserve better. Oh and a few more digs because I was a mouthy B. And broke up with Troy then and there and blocked his number. 

Well, this seemed to be the green light for Da. He took this as his chance to try and slide his slimmy self in. He walked me to my car after work. I told him I could walk my self. The next day my car wouldn't start. So he came to pick me up and drove me to work. I accepted cause I'd be darned if I'd be late. I thanked him. He didn't have The car that night but walked me home. It was cold. He gave me his jacket. He looked and fixed my car for free. He'd bring me my favorite coffee. He'd buy me lunch. 

At this time he and his wife… who wasn't his wife. They never married officially, split. I liked his ex. Had a bit of a crush on her. I'm pan. So I actually asked a mutual friend if she could possibly be Bi. Well Da found out and soon he told me she was actually homophobic. Talked mad bs about me behind my back. And many many more excuses. Which i found odd since she knew i liked girls then. This woman let me feel baby move all the time. Every time i saw her she would grab my hand and place it on her belly saying baby calmed at my touch. So hearing this from Da, i actually felt pretty hurt. Not only that but soon she started being shady with me. Later it came out that she was Bi. She was interested in me and Da made her think i was getting close to baby to become mom to his kids. I mean i was… sorta… but not the way he was making it sound. I was into her not him. Red flag 2. 

For two whole weeks this man was chasing me and he made it very obvious. And I shot him down every time. Then one day we were talking movies. My  kryptonite. He asked me over for a movie night… at his mother's. Stupid me was like heck yeah. I love Karen. Low and behold. I get there… Karen was not. I didn't want to bee too rude so I agreed to one move and maybe a few drinks. I don't even remember half of the first movie… and im no lightweight. Big ol flapping red flag number three. 
I woke up on the couch with Da next to me both nakie from the waist down. Honestly I puked. Still not sure if it was from being hungover or waking next to him. Da help my hair rubbed my back. Apologized over and over again. Cried. (Insert forehead smack here at my stupidity for not seeing the manipulation.) And then asked if we could be official because he just had this unforgettable connection to me. Love at first sight. I made his knees weak. I was the most beautiful woman he'd ever seen. Blah blah (gag) 

Stupid me. Fell right into his grubby little claws and said yes. 

Two days later at work… Karen told me to run. Forget her son. I was better than him. Get out while I could. could red flag 4 be any more glaringly obvious. 

Three days later I invited Da back to my place. We ran into my dad the next morning. I to this day have no clue what Da had said to my dad… but this man looked me in my eyes. A man I haven't spoken too in months. And told me not to go with Da. That if I left. Not to come back. And I ignored that glaring red flag number 5 and moved in with Da. 

Everything seemed amazing in our relationship. Our spicy sleep life sucked… but that was my preference not his. And it was daily. Multiple times. He sure was happy about it… Can we say red flag 6? 

We never fought, he love bombed the heck out of me and I fell farther and farther down that damn rabbit hole. For six months things were great… and then we had our first fight. And why is that you Ask…. Well remember Troy? Da asked me questions from time to time. Innocent questions. Not even really asking about Troy. Things like. What bars had I been to last. What restaurant had I ate at last. And so on. This was his way of grabbing information from me. And one day he asked me to take him to the bar I had last been in. So I took him. And low and behold. There was Troy with his friends. And the more drinks Da got in his system… it wasn't pretty. Things were said. A fight broke out. And a pool stick was broken on the back of Da's head. Oh don't worry. He was fine. Barely registered. You'd think he just got swatted by a bee. I got Da home and that is when he blew up on me. 

I took him there knowing Troy would be there. Accusations of cheating. I made Troy hit him. The accusations went on all night. And with each one he broke me down to a shell of a person. Big ol red flag 7.

And after he knew he had his claws officially sunk in… I met his other kids. All five I didn't know about. Making the number of kids at the time 7.  Huge huge huge flag 8

He started to use my debit card with out my knowledge. Then yelled at me when we had no money for bills… what bills. We lived in a house owned by his boss. Rent came out of his check. We had no internet. No car no phone. No utilities. Red flag 9. 

I got sick and called into work. It was bad sick. He refused to take me to the hospital. And he refused to call work for me because I couldn't. I ended up getting fired. And the. He took me to the hospital. I still have no idea what I had. I was in and out of consciousness for a few days. He talked to the doctors. I never did. Red flag nine.

He decided we needed to move. So we used my last paycheck to get a bigger place for us and the kids. All the bills were in my name. Which I didn't know. he tried to convince me to be a stay at home mother. I refused. Loved our kids. But they weren't ours full time. Red flag 10.

I got another high paying job. But had many call ins or late clock ins due to Da having the car. He had no license by the way. I was lucky that my coworkers were angels. They could see what Da was doing. They covered shifts, I got a raise soon after starting. They slowly got me to see how toxic the relationship was. And then… the one thing I was told could never happened.. happened… I got pregnant. I found out at work. A coworker had me take a test since I was showing symptoms. I broke down in a panic attack When I saw that positive. I always wanted kids. But gave up on ever having any. And here I was pregnant by a man I couldn't actually stand. And I pretended I didn't know. And took another test with Da. He was over the moon. And then said he had been trying to get me pregnant so I'd never leave him… huge gigantic Red flag 11. We had only been together 13 months. And stupid me had stayed… because he had seven kids and he used them. Knowing how bad I had wanted to be a mother. Red flag 12. 

When I was 4 months pregnant, I honesty didn't look it. Baby hid well. We took our kids to the beach along with Da's friend Kyle. As I sat In the shade with his older kids, he used his younger kids to grab the attention of a very hot woman. And I mean smoking hot. He ended up asking her to join us at our area. And I introduced myself… as Da's girlfriend. Babe was shocked. He never mentioned having a girlfriend. She started to apologize. I said she could have him. I'd even keep his kids. Sadly she wouldn't take the bait. And he got mad at me for scaring off Babe his new friend. Red flag well who's counting at this point. There are a lot. His kids had told me that day that I needed to leave. That I'd always be their other mom. I deserved better. And stupid me stayed.

The next month Da started to be very controlling over OUR SHARED PHONE! yes i said that right. The phone we both used and I paid for. Well one day he came home at 4 am and passed out. Our phone dinged at 6am. So I checked it. And low and behold. The DA was cheating. And this is what a saw.

New girl: hey, baby. I had such a great time. are you going to stop by for that quicky before work today? 

Me: sadly he will be busy. Packing his shit 

NG: um sorry who is this?

Me: oh his 5 month pregnant girlfriend to his 8th baby.

NG: oh my god I am so sorry. He never told me he was in a relationship. 

NG: wait! He has 8 kids!!!!

Me: well he's single now. You want him. I can have him on your doorstep in a few hours. 

NG: hell no! I just met him last week when he came to visit my dad. 

Me: Wait… how old are you? 

NG: 21.

Me: girl this man is 35 years old.

NG: he said he was 26!

Me: no honey I'm 26. Well damn. I won't drop him off on you then. Have a good life hun word of advice. He's not worth anything he says he is. I'd block this number. 

NG: thanks. What's your name?

Me: (insert name)

NG: He told me you were his sister!!!


Low and behold. His mother wouldn't take him either. And I got stuck with this man for another month when our electricity got cut off. Our landlord kicked us out and we became homeless… and I was in the middle of getting full custody of one of his kids. Found out he wasn't paying any bills. That were all in my name. And Kyle moved us in with him. And Kyle was a saint. He'd keep Da out of the house. He gave me access to a computer. And even gave me a phone. So as Da was at work. I reached out to friends he had cut from my life… and I sucked it up and called my parents. They had me moved out and placed in a safe place within a week. 

I got to make it to my best friends wedding. I crashed since I wasn't officially invited. But he came a running when he saw me with the guest and cried for a good five minutes. And before I went home asked him to be godfather. He cried again. And I was finally home. 

Da ended up back with his hot Bi ex. As he had also been looking up with her on his visits to see their kids. She didn't even know we were still together after my baby Was born. But they got married for real. It only lasted 2 years.

Da broke into my house at 3 am to see our son when he was 3 months old. And that was the last time I had seen him. Luckily I was awake. But because of jurisdiction issues it's hard to get police out in my area so I just ran to my neighbors. 


He still calls or messages me. Every 6 months or so. I do not reply to anything Because. “How are you babe.” “I miss our family.” “Come back to me.” is pathetic to send for 11 years of being apart. And have nothing to do with our son. 

He did ask once how our son was doing. And I told him. Sent him photos updated him on his life. Da swore he wanted to be in sons life. I simply replied… I'm not allowing that till you can prove you can be a dad…. Ghosted… for another six months and it was back to. “Babe i love you so much. I want our family back.” Gag. 

And before you ask. We did not go to court for custody. He does not pay child support. And for 11 years he stays away. I keep all evidence of contact or lack there off in case court is ever brought up and have a lawyer ready and waiting for the moment. And He is not on the birth certificate. The only thing my son has of Da is his mouth. 

My parents and I have also decided to not speak ill of Da. So my son has the choice of asking questions When he is ready. But we also decided not to lie either. He has only asked a few questions. And has met all but 2 of his siblings. And they don't hold back. But as of now. He has no interest in meeting Da.

I bought an Baratza Encore ESP and a Sage (Breville) Bambino Plus. I have good quality beans from a local roastery, and use the single wall basket for 18g of coffee. I have two main problems: if I grind at setting 20, which is the coarsest of the espresso settings, the shot will poor through the filter in less than 10 seconds. If I go just 2 clicks finer, no liquid comes through at all, the machine chokes. I am wondering how I am supposed to get 25-30 seconds of extraction, when the machine does not seem to build pressure that long. Secondly, I feel like the grinder coffee has massive chunks, which are even with a WDT Tool hard to break.

I didn't know this at first because I never knew that she knew him. Bea told me that they dated for about 6 months. That's not super long but enough to form a pretty good relationship. I asked her why they broke up and she told me that by the end they both just weren't feeling the spark and decided to end things on good terms and decided to stay friends.

Ashlyn  
  
I woke up feeling disappointed as I looked at the empty space on my bed. I was hoping Ian, my boyfriend of the last two years and the future alpha of our pack, would have snuck into my room last night.  
  
Today is my eighteenth birthday. The first official day I can sniff out my mate. I was hoping Ian would have been here when I woke up since he decided to go out with his friends last night. I didn’t say anything when plans of us hanging out changed, but I should have. I wanted to, but I didn’t want to put on a show in front of his friends when they barged into the pack house yesterday. I just let him go, hoping he would choose me.  
  
“So, what do you think?” I asked my wolf, Tundra, as I stepped into the shower.  
  
“I don’t know what to think, Ash. I know he cares about us, but is that really enough,” she sighed.  
  
My blissful birthday bumble had been popped as I got ready to head to the pack house to find him. I wanted him to be my fated mate. I love him. Before his mother died, I spent so much time with her, even before Ian and I got together.  
  
I came here to live with my mother’s sister after both my parents died. She was newly mated and not ready to handle a soon-to-be nine-year-old who just lost everything. Don’t get me wrong, Aunt Grace and her mate, Brad, are wonderful, and I owe them both so much.  
  
After I was ready, I looked at myself in the mirror one more time before heading downstairs. Aunt Grace was sitting at the table, looking down at her phone as she sipped a mug full of coffee.  
  
“Good morning,” I came up behind her and gave her a hug.  
  
“Happy Birthday, sweetie,” she squealed, and I giggled. “You must be so excited for today. I half expected Alpha Ian to be walking in behind you.”  
  
“Yeah, me too,” I mumbled, letting her go.  
  
“Is everything okay?” She asked me, the excitement of the day now lost.  
  
“Yeah, of course, I’m going to go find Ian,” I smiled before walking out of the kitchen to the front door.  
  
“Good luck,” she called out as I closed the door behind me.  
  
The cold fall air nipped my hot skin as I walked down the path to the sidewalk. The pack house was a ten-minute walk from my house. There was a new dusting of snow, and the early morning sun was still rising over the tree line. It would have been a beautiful morning if my stomach wasn’t twisted into knots. And the closer I walked to the park house, the tighter those knots became.  
  
“I’m glad I didn’t eat this morning,” I mumbled to Tundra.  
  
“Everything is going to work out, Ash, don’t worry so much.”  
  
I stopped at the end of the driveway and took a deep breath before walking up to the oak front doors. As soon as I stepped inside, the most delicious scent hit me. Musk, cedar, and vanilla.  
  
“Mate,” Tundra purred, and I smiled. My mate is here.  
  
I followed the scent up to the alpha floor, and that's when I knew it was Ian. Other members lived in the pack house, but this floor only had Ian and his father, Alpha Jason.  
  
The scent was stronger as I stood in front of his bedroom door. I closed my eyes and took a deep breath. This was the moment I had been waiting for—for two years.  
  
Grunts and groans caused me to open my eyes and look at the door in front of me.  
  
“Yes, Ian. Yes, right there,” a woman cried out. Before I knew what I was doing, I threw open the door. What I saw is something I could never unsee.  
  
Ian was standing at the end of his bed, naked. Sweat glistened his skin as he thrust his hips. I couldn’t say a word as I watched him with legs wrapped around his waist. Those weren’t my legs.  
  
Tundra let out a murderous growl, and the room stopped.  
  
Ian turned to face the door, his steel-blue eyes meeting my green ones.  
  
“Ashlyn,” he stammered. With his body turned, I was able to see the woman lying naked on his bed with my mate and boyfriend inside of her. Nicole.  
  
“This isn’t what it looks like,” he stepped away from her, and Nicole fumbled to get underneath the blanket.  
  
My eyes filled with tears as I wondered what I did to deserve this. Ian was my best friend. We have been together for almost two years. The entire pack knew we were together. I felt like a f\*\*\*\*\*g joke.  
  
“It looks like my boyfriend and best friend are naked together. Am I missing something?” I crossed my arms over my chest. Ian stuttered, unable to get the words out as he stood in front of me naked, his d\*\*k covered in another woman. “I’m sorry, my mate and best friend are f\*\*\*\*\*g,” I yelled. This was all too much for me to handle right now. Their betrayal ripped at my soul.  
  
I watched as Ian sniffed the air with his wolf, Jax, coming forward.  
  
“Mate,” he exhaled.  
  
“Ex-mate, Ian. I, Ashlyn Knight, future alpha of the Emerald Lake pack, reject you, Ian Walker, future alpha of the Blue Moon pack.” I didn’t wait for him to answer as I stepped out of his room, slamming the door behind me. My heart twisted painfully, and my legs wobbled as I grabbed the railing.  
  
I needed to get out of here. I couldn’t stay here with this constant reminder of their betrayal.  
  
Relief hit me when I made it down the last step and was so close to the front door. I was stopped when strong arms wrapped around me. Ian’s father squeezed me close. He was the father I needed after my own passed.  
  
“Happy Birthday, sweetheart.” He let me go and stepped back. Looking up at him, I felt like I was going to break. I had so much here, but I couldn’t stay.  
  
“I need to leave,” I choked, and his face fell.  
  
“What’s wrong? Where’s Ian?” He asked, gripping my shoulders.  
  
“The pack. I need to leave the pack.” I stammered as I tried to hold down the need to cry.  
  
“Ashlyn,” he pulled me against his chest again, and I was so close to breaking down. I was going to miss Alpha Jason. He had taught me so much about being an alpha and made this place feel like home.  
  
“Do you want to tell me what happened?” He mumbled softly as he held me. I shook my head. The moment that happened was raw in my mind, and I wanted to run away.  
  
I held onto him when a commotion came from the floors above.  
  
“Go, sweetheart. Be safe.” He kissed the top of my head. I looked up at him, and he nodded. With that, I rushed out the front door and ran off in the direction of home.  
  
I need to get out of here.  
  
I stormed into the house and marched up the stairs to my room. I could hear my aunt calling to me, but I couldn’t stop. The pain in my chest was eating away at my soul, and it burned.  
  
“I’m so sorry, Tundra,” I cried, crumbling to my knees beside my bed. She didn’t say anything, only whimpered at the loss of her mate.  
  
“Ashlyn, what the hell is going on?” Aunt Grace pushed open my door before she gasped. “Sweetie, what’s wrong?” She rushed to kneel beside me.  
  
“He cheated. He was my mate, and he cheated,” I cried as she wrapped me in her arms.  
  
“Oh, my sweet, Ashlyn,” she exhaled as I cried on her shoulder.  
  
I lost track of how long I sat on the floor in her arms and cried. Why would he do this to me? The burning question swirled in my mind as my aunt held me.  
  
“Hey, let's head into the city for a few days. We can go shopping and stay at one of those crazy expensive hotels. There will be a spa where we can get pampered. It will be good for you.” I looked up at her, and she smiled, but her eyes were sad. I nodded, and she pulled me close again.  
  
“Pack a bag, and we will leave soon. I need to call Brad,” she pulled away, kissing my forehead before looking at me again. “Everything is going to be okay.” She stood up and left me still sitting on the floor. I took a big breath before wiping away the tears on my cheeks.  
  
Pack a bag; that’s something I could do right now.  
  
I stood up and went into my closet to pull some clothes together. I couldn’t shake what I saw. Ian was my best friend. We were so good together until his mother passed away. That’s when he started to pull away. He spent more time with his friends, drinking. I just never thought he would step out. I was giving him space to grieve in his own way. But I could never forgive that, no matter how much I loved him.  
  
“Ready?” Aunt Grace asked from the open door. I was stuffing some clothes into a backpack. I nodded, zipping up the bag. I grabbed my phone charger off the bedside table and stuffed it in my purse before following my aunt out of my room.  
  
I needed to get out of here. I don’t have much money, but I will figure it out when I get there. I had to. I couldn’t stay here.  
  
My aunt took my bag, and with my purse in hand, I climbed into the passenger seat of her SUV. My mind buzzed with mind links, and my phone buzzed in my pocket, but I ignored it. I didn’t need to open them to know it was Ian and Nicole. But what could they possibly say about their actions? She was my friend, and he was my boyfriend.  
  


# Messed Up

Future Alpha Ian  
  
I howled in pain as I gripped my chest and fell to my knees. She rejected me. I pushed Nicole away when she tried to touch me. She has done enough. I stumbled to grab my clothes as the pain subsided in my chest. My wolf, Jax, was whimpering in pain at his mate's rejection.  
  
I f\*\*\*\*d up. I’m such a f\*\*\*\*\*g f\*\*k up, and I screamed in my head as I ripped the sweatpants up my legs and rushed from my room.  
  
I needed to get to her, to explain, to say something. But what the hell do I say? I never wanted someone as perfect as Ashlyn to see how f\*\*\*\*d up I was.  
  
I raced down the stairs, hearing Nicole yelling behind me, but I didn’t stop. I ran until my father’s glare met me at the bottom. I stopped with Nicole running into my back.  
  
“Ian, what the hell?” She gasped, wrapping her arms around my bare waist. I quickly moved her arms as my father watched.  
  
“Both of you to my office now,” he ordered.  
  
“Dad, I need.”  
  
“Now,” he commented.  
  
I turned around to head up to my father’s office. I snapped Nicole’s wrists before she ran her hands down my bare chest.  
  
“Enough,” I growled, moving around her. I stomped up the stairs to his office. I tried to link her, but she wouldn’t open the link. I reached into my pockets, but my phone was still in my pocket. f\*\*k.  
  
“Both of you sit,” my father demanded as he and his beta, Nicole’s father, walked in behind us.  
  
“Dad, I don’t have time for this. I need to go after Ashlyn. Have you seen her?” I rushed out, not taking a seat. My body was trembling with the need to run out of her and track her down. I needed to explain. To come up with something she could forgive to get another chance.  
  
“I don’t think she wants to see you, son. I don’t know what happened, but I have an idea. What the hell were you thinking?” He shook his head, and shame filled me, twisting my stomach.  
  
“Alpha Jason, Daddy, Ian, and I are in love,” Nicole announced.  
  
“No, we are not,” I corrected as I paced the room. “This isn't love, Nicole, this is sex.” Her father growled, but I didn’t care. It was the truth.  
  
“So, when did you and Ashlyn break up? Today is her eighteenth birthday. Was she not your mate?” my father asked, and I pinched the bridge of my nose.  
  
“Not anymore,” Nicole exclaimed. My attention snapped to my father’s Beta’s daughter, and Jax let out a growl.  
  
“She rejected you,” my father exhaled.  
  
“Dad, I can fix this. This isn’t a done deal,” I assured him.  
  
“Nicole, why would you do something like this? You knew they were together?” Her father questioned.  
  
“I’m the beta’s daughter. I should be Luna, not some unranked b\*\*\*h,” she scoffed as she crossed her arms over her chest.  
  
“You fucken cunt,” I screamed. I lunged, but my father held me back. I was ready to murder her. I shouldn’t have done it, but her reasons infuriated me.  
  
“Leave,” my father ordered as he held me back. I watched his beta grab his daughter and force her from the office.  
  
“Now, what the hell were you thinking?” He scolded, pushing me back up against the wall.  
  
“I wasn’t, okay. I f\*\*\*\*d up. I f\*\*\*\*d everything up, but if I could just speak to her, I can fix this,” I plead. He barked a laugh, and I clenched my fists. How was any of this funny?  
  
“Ashlyn is never going to forgive you. You f\*\*\*\*d up, and now you are going to have to live with it,” he shook his head before taking a seat behind his desk.  
  
“I’m going to try,” I told him.  
  
“She has already left the territory, son. She asked to leave, and I permitted it. If she wants to talk to you, she will have to answer your calls,” he shrugged.  
  
“Why the f\*\*k would you allow that? She rejected me, and you just let her leave?” I screamed.  
  
“Son, I know this last year has been hard, but you need to grow up if you want to be the alpha I expect. Men don’t cheat on their women. Men protect what is theirs. Maybe next time you will get it right.” I was raging inside at my father’s words. I did this. I hurt her, and she left.  
  
I left his office without another word. There was nothing I could say to justify what I had done. Instead, I raced up to my room to grab my phone and a shirt before marching out the front door of the pack house. I know he said she had left, but I’m praying she hasn’t left her house yet. I was going to beg and plead on my knees for her forgiveness.  
  
I’ll do anything to get her back.  
  
I ran. I ran as fast as I could until I stood in front of her door, taking harsh breaths.   
  
“Ashlyn,” I called as I banged on the door. “Please open the door?”  
  
I tried to open a link, but she didn’t answer, so I pulled out my phone and dialled her number. My heart twisted tighter as it rang until I heard her voice saying to leave a message.  
  
“Please, Ashlyn, please, just talk to me. I know I can make this right. I love you.” I ended the call.  
  
“I told you, Ian. I told you not to f\*\*k this up, but you didn’t listen.” Jax growled.  
  
“I know, okay. I know I f\*\*\*\*d this up. I’m a complete asshat.” I exhaled as I leaned against the door. “I’m sorry.”  
  
I opened a link with someone who could tell me where she was going. I needed to go after her.  
  
“Alpha Ian, what can I do for you?” Brad, Ashlyn’s uncle, grumbled when he opened the link. I ignored his tone, knowing Grace had probably told him what had happened.  
  
“Where’s Ashlyn?”   
  
“I don’t want to get in the middle of this. You hurt her, and I’m pissed. How the hell could you have done that?” He demanded.  
  
“I need to speak with her, Brad. Now, tell me where she went. I can’t fix this if I can’t speak to her.” I argued. If he wasn’t a part of the pack, I knew he would tell me to go f\*\*k myself. Brad has always been protective of his niece.  
  
“She went into the city with Grace. They are staying for a few days to go shopping and relax. She will call you when she is ready to speak to you,” he snapped before ending the link.  
  
I stepped off the porch and walked back home. She had just gone into the city to cool off but would be back—she had to come back.  
  
I walked into the pack house and headed up to my room. My best friend and future beta was waiting outside my room.  
  
“What the hell happened to you? You look like shit.”  
  
“Thanks, I grumbled as I opened the door and stepped inside. He followed and took a seat in one of the leather chairs while I flopped down on the couch. I leaned my head back and closed my eyes as I replayed the morning.  
  
“It’s been a crazy morning,” he chuckled. “I came back from training to find my father screaming at Nicole. I didn’t think he had it in him.” I sighed in response. “But what the hell happened to you? It was Ashlyn’s birthday today. Wasn’t it? Why are you not with her?” He questioned. I opened my eyes and turned my attention to my beta.  
  
I couldn’t say it. Everyone who knew her loved her. She is fun and easy-going. She was larger than life, and she chose me. She could have picked anyone, but she picked me, and I hurt her. I cheated, and it wasn’t just with Nicole. I would drink until I couldn’t remember, chasing away the demons that haunted me. But I just created more, and now, I’ve lost her.  
  
“Ian,” Alex pressed when I didn’t answer.  
  
“She caught me with Nicole,” I breathed out. My heart clenched with the admission.  
  
“Caught you and Nicole doing what?” He questioned before I watched his eyes go wide, and he growled.  
  
“What the hell is wrong with you? She’s my damn sister,” he exclaimed. Standing from his seat, he paced the room.  
  
“I know,” I mumbled.  
  
“How did this happen, Ian? I thought you were with Ashlyn,” he exhaled. He stopped and looked at me.  
  
“It started about a year ago. I was drunk at a party, Ashlyn wasn’t there, and Nicole threw herself at me. I should have said no, but I didn’t. She was in my room after training this morning. I shouldn’t have done what I did. Ashlyn walked in and claimed me as her mate.”  
  
“Ashlyn is your mate,” he murmured.  
  
“She rejected me and left.”  
  
“f\*\*k, man.” He took a seat again, resting his elbows on his knees. “I should punch you for f\*\*\*\*\*g my sister and for hurting Ashlyn. Such a stupid f\*\*k,” he grumbled that last part.  
  
“Have you spoken to her?” He asked.  
  
“She hasn’t answered my links or calls.” I sighed, feeling defeated.  
  
“I don’t blame her. I would be ripping my eyeballs out if I had seen that,” he exclaimed.  
  
“I already feel bad enough,” I snapped.  
  
“Ian, I don’t know what you want from me. I’m not going to sugarcoat things for you. This is f\*\*\*\*d up. Ashlyn is your mate. Your girlfriend. And as your best friend, I didn’t see this coming. I know you haven’t been yourself since your mother’s death, but to hurt Ashlyn, I don’t understand, man,” he said. I leaned forward and rested my head in my hands.  
  
“I know, Alex. I didn’t want anyone to see how messed up I was. I hurt the best thing in my life. Someone who the Moon Goddess blessed me with, and she’s gone. She went to the city, and I don’t know when she will be coming back.” I choked.  
  
“She’ll be back, man. I know she loves you. She cares, maybe too much, in this case.” He clasped my shoulder.  
  
“There’s something else,” I sighed, looking at him.  
  
“Go on, I don’t think it can get much worse.”  
  
“In her rejection, she mentioned being the future alpha of the Emerald Lake pack. Have you heard of it?” I asked.  
  
“I don’t think so. Are you sure that’s what she said?”  
  
“Maybe,” I shrugged.  
  
“I’ll look into it while you think of a way to win her back. It’s not going to be easy.”  
  
“I’ll do anything,” I assured him.  
  
“I know you will,” he patted my back. I'll let you know when I find anything.” I nodded before he left me in my empty bedroom.  
  
I hated myself. I hurt the one person who genuinely cared about me. She didn’t care about being Luna. She didn’t care about money or brand names. She did the things she did because that's who she was. She cared. And like everything else in my life, I f\*\*\*\*d it up.  
  
How was I ever going to gain back her trust?  
  


# Leaving it all Behind

Ashlyn  
  
I leaned my head against the vehicle window as my aunt sped down the highway toward the city. I was finally far enough away that the buzzing from the mind links stopped.   
  
My tears had dried up, and now I was thinking about what I would do with my life. I was born to run a pack, but with my father gone and no more alpha mate, I would have to find something else.  
  
I realized I had never thought of what to do if this all fell apart. I had more faith in Ian than I should have had. I wanted us to happen so badly that I lost myself.  
  
“Sweetie, how are you feeling?” Aunt Grace asked, and I turned to look at her.  
  
“I don’t know,” I shrugged.  
  
“I know this is hard, and you are hurt, but I don’t want you to worry about anything. Just think of where you want to go.”  
  
“I only have so much money, so I can only run so far,” I sighed.  
  
“There’s a box on the backseat. Can you reach it?” I looked behind me and saw a shoebox behind Aunt Grace's seat. I quickly unbuckled and reached into the back. After I retrieved it, I placed it on my lap before buckling my seatbelt again.  
  
“Open it,” she encouraged.  
  
I opened the box to find the documents. Looking through the papers, I saw a picture of my parents and me. I gasped, and tears filled my eyes as I looked at our smiling faces. My heart ached for them.  
  
“I took that picture before you visited me and Brad.”  
  
I looked deeper and found a picture of me with a boy. I didn’t recognize him, but I smiled at his smiling face. He was older than me, and I wondered how I knew him then.  
  
“There are bank statements from your parent’s accounts in there.” I put the picture back and took out a few of the papers. Looking over a statement, I saw more zeros than I’d ever seen before.  
  
“I don’t understand, what is this?” I held up the paper and looked at my aunt.  
  
“Your parents didn’t leave you with nothing, Ashlyn. There is more than enough money to do whatever you want. There are businesses and investments. They have a financial adviser we will see when we arrive in the city. He will be able to explain everything. Now that you are eighteen, you can legally inherit everything.”  
  
My head was spinning as I leaned it back against the seat. What the hell was happening? I don’t remember my parents having this kind of money. Can investments grow that much in ten years?  
  
After everything that had happened that day, I closed my eyes, needing a moment of silence.  
  
When I opened my eyes, we were already driving into the city.   
  
“There’s the bank,” my aunt pointed out before parking her SUV. It was more like a glass skyscraper in the heart of the city.  
  
“There are things I need to tell you before we head inside,” she said, shutting off the engine and turning to me.  
  
“Okay,” I dragged out, turning to face her.  
  
“Your mother and I weren’t blood. I was adopted by your grandparents after my parent’s deaths. They were my family, but I was never blood.”  
  
“I don’t understand,” I stammered.  
  
“Your mother inherited the pack from your grandparents with her alpha mate, your father. They were both good with investments, and everything was left to you when they passed.” She smiled.  
  
“And you?”  
  
“Your grandparents left me money in their will after their untimely death when you were six years old. They were killed in a car accident.”  
  
“What about my father’s parents?” I questioned.  
  
“I never met them, sweetie. I don’t know anything about his side.”  
  
“Okay,” I whispered. I hoped to find a piece of my parents that I had missed.  
  
“Okay, let’s get in there and see Mr. Fisher.”  
  
After visiting the financial adviser/banker, I was all set to start my new life, whatever that might be. However, I still didn’t know what I wanted to do. How on earth could any of this be happening?  
  
“Let’s go get a room, and then we can head for dinner. What do you want to do first? Shopping?” Aunt Grace exclaimed as she walked beside me.  
  
“I don’t think I’m returning to the pack,” I blurted. She gripped my arm and pulled me off to one side of the sidewalk. The afternoon foot traffic was filling up the busy streets.  
  
“I’m not going to force you to go back there. You can stay in the city or go wherever your little heart desires. But you will need some things if you stay here,” I nodded. “Let’s get you a vehicle, then we can return to the hotel for dinner. Tomorrow, we can go shopping for anything you might need.”  
  
“Thank you,” I told her.  
  
“You don’t need to thank me, sweet girl; whatever you decide to do or go, I will always support you,” she said, giving me a side hug, which I returned. Not everyone in my life was a disappointment. Now, let’s get out of this cold wind and find you something cool to drive.” I chuckled as we began walking towards her parked SUV.  
  
Pulling up in front of the dealership, I knew I would buy the vehicle. Buying something impractical for the winters here may have been ridiculous, but it was beautiful.   
  
“Good afternoon, ladies. How may I help you?” A young salesman approached us as we entered the showroom.  
  
“My niece here,” she grabbed my hand and pulled me towards her before I could wander. She was looking for a vehicle.”  
  
“Do you have a vehicle in mind, miss,” he shamelessly checked me out.  
  
“Miss Knight,” I smiled. “And I would like that one,” I said, pointing to the deep teal sports car.  
  
“You have good taste, but you must speak with the finance department before we can allow you to test drive the car.”  
  
“Oh, that’s not a problem. I’m planning on paying cash,” I dug through my purse for my wallet before pulling out my new shiny black card. His eyes went wide, and Grace chuckled.  
  
“It’s also going to need a set of winter tires,” she told him.  
  
“Yes, of course. Can you give me a minute,” he stammered before leaving us.  
  
“That was fun,” Aunt Grace giggled.  
  
“It was,” I agreed.  
  
We walked to the clean, sleek car, and I ran my fingertips over the hood.  
  
“Are you sure about this one?” She questioned.

Hi all,
I finally decided that I had enough of nesspresso and want to upgrade to the good stuff,
Began by looking at a more simple machine +grinder (thermoblock) like braville barista express or delonghi la specialista,
Then started to go down the rabbit hole of boilers and better grinder etc, and looking at gaggia classic pro or lalit pl41lem,
And now I’m completely confused not to even start talking about grinders lol,
I’m lookin to do more lattes but will do some espresso,
To be honest I came back after a long trip in nz and drank a lot of specialty coffee and I just can’t go back to the regular coffee, I want to get as close as possible to that.
Soo what do you think? Any recommendations?

1kfww10,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_No-Carry9000/comments/1kfww10/nurses_week_2025_honoring_the_heart_and_soul_of/,Nurses Week 2025: Honoring the Heart and Soul of Healthcare,"Every year from **May 6 through May 12**, America comes together to celebrate **National Nurses Week**—seven days dedicated to recognizing and appreciating the nearly **5 million nurses** across the country who show up, suit up, and care deeply for the well-being of others.

But let’s be honest: one week isn’t nearly enough time to thank nurses for what they do every single day.

# More Than a Profession: It’s a Calling

Nursing is not just a job. It’s not even just a career. For many, it’s a calling. Whether it's staying late to comfort a scared patient, working weekends and holidays without complaint, or offering calm in the middle of a medical storm, nurses bring a level of dedication that’s hard to put into words.

Nurses are healers, teachers, listeners, and advocates. They are the ones who check in when no one else does. The ones who remember your name, your fears, your allergies, and how you like your coffee—if you're lucky enough to be up for coffee.

# Why Nurses Week Matters

Nurses Week isn’t just symbolic—it’s historical. It starts on **May 6**, recognized as **National Nurses Day**, and concludes on **May 12**, which marks the birth anniversary of[ **Florence Nightingale**](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Florence-Nightingale), the pioneer of modern nursing. Florence Nightingale revolutionized patient care in the 19th century, and her legacy lives on in the hearts of nurses today.

This week gives us all a chance to pause and say something that doesn’t get said often enough: **thank you.**

# What Nurses Really Do (Spoiler Alert: It’s A Lot)

Some people assume that nurses simply carry out doctors' instructions, but that view greatly undervalues their true role. Nurses are often the first to notice when something’s wrong, the ones keeping everything on track, and the ones catching the smallest detail that could make the biggest difference.

Here are just a few roles nurses take on:

* **Registered Nurses (RNs)** coordinate care, monitor patient health, and serve as the frontline responders in hospitals, clinics, and community settings.
* **Nurse Practitioners (NPs**) often act as primary care providers, with the authority to diagnose conditions, provide treatment, and prescribe medications.
* **Critical Care Nurses** manage life-or-death situations in ICUs and emergency departments.
* **Home Health Nurses** bring professional care to patients’ front doors, providing comfort in familiar settings.
* Through education and groundbreaking research, **Nurse Educators and Researchers** play a vital role in advancing the future of healthcare.

Whether they’re in scrubs at the bedside, conducting research, managing teams, or training the next generation, nurses are everywhere—and we depend on them more than we realize

# The Impact of Nurses in Our Lives

You may not remember the name of the surgeon who performed your operation, but you probably remember the nurse who held your hand before it started. You might forget the test results, but you’ll never forget the nurse who explained them to you with patience and clarity.

For families, nurses are often the first to offer hope—and the last to say goodbye. That kind of emotional labor is invisible, but it's profoundly real.

# How to Celebrate Nurses Week (And Beyond)

Celebrating Nurses Week isn’t just about decorations and donuts in the breakroom—though those are always appreciated. It’s about respect, recognition, and support.

Here are some thoughtful, meaningful ways to honor nurses this week:

# 1. Say It Out Loud

Even a small ""thank you"" can have a greater impact than you realize.. Take a few minutes to write a card, send an email, or give a nurse a shout-out on social media.

# 2. Listen to Their Stories

Everyone loves a good hero story—and nurses have plenty of them. Ask about their experiences. Share their voices. Let the world hear what they’ve seen and how they've helped.

# 3. Support Their Growth

Offer opportunities for professional development—whether it's training, certification courses, or mentorship programs. Invest in their future like they invest in yours.

# 4. Give Thoughtful Gifts

It doesn’t have to be expensive. Gift cards, handwritten notes, self-care baskets, or even just a hot coffee during a long shift can brighten a nurse’s day.

# 5. Advocate for Change

Support policies that ensure safe staffing ratios, mental health support, and fair wages for nurses. Appreciation is great—but advocacy is powerful.

# A Final Word: From the Heart

If you’re a nurse reading this: **Thank you.** Thank you for choosing this path. Thank you for being there, even when it's not easy to do so.Thank you for being the calm in the chaos, the strength in someone’s weakest moment, and the light in some of life’s darkest times.

To everyone else: Let this week be a reminder to cherish and support the nurses in our lives—not just now, but all year long.

Because behind every healed patient, every comforted family, and every medical miracle, there’s a nurse.

*Here’s to the nurses—this week, and every week. You are the driving force, and compassion is at the core of healthcare.*",1,1746509168.0,u_No-Carry9000,0,1.0,False

But here is the thing…I don’t feel excited or happy about it. I tried thinking of ways our marriage got better in the last year but I can only think of many ways it got worse…not better. The only ‘better’ part is related to in-laws. Last years anniversary my husband was travelling back home. Once he got home he was tired and didn’t want to do anything. I tried to be understanding (although a bit upset he chose to travel on our anniversary) and asked to make it up at a later time. That time never came. We never celebrated it. And within this year since last I trekked to find something worth celebrating but I can’t think of anything. We had many fights, he seems like he hates me most of the time, has called me names like ‘parasite’ and once told me “I wish you would just die already.” There is no love, no affection, no positive attention…and we had intimacy a whopping 2 times this year (that number only goes lower every year). Our marriage seems like nothing more than a repeat of he tells me what to do and then I do it. Repeated the next day. He use to say he doesn’t show me love or tension or affection bcs I didn’t listen to him, but reality is even if I do he shows nothing. 
All I can thing about lately is what happens when the kids are grown and leave. I will be stuck alone with my husband…married but yet incredibly lonely. I can’t share my feelings with him usually and he never tells me anything. If he does, it is the very bare minimum, but even then leaves out important details sometimes then claims he told me. His sister is his best friend. He talks with her all the time and tells her everything…such privileges I as a wife never get. 
I just don’t understand what there is left to celebrate, besides our kids. Right now he is sleeping in bed with me, with his back facing me. That is usually how it is. No cuddling or any such things. In the morning I will wake up and get the kids ready for school then make coffee for my husband. Perform ‘wifely’ duties of cleaning and cooking…then repeat the next day.

I have gone a tad desperate with the coffee prises. Saw a package in Lidl for 2.50 shine in Lidl. Time stopped for a second and I heard angels singing (or maybe it was someone's phone ringing). 

Too good to taste good, I figure, but can I justify not trying it for that price? 

No.

The first cup did impress me. But keep in mind that my expectations were touching the floor. 

I am drinking my second cup this morning and I am undecided if I like it or not. It's better than gas station coffee, for sure. I personally like it better than Juhla Mokka. It doesn't have an appealing coffee smell though.

Well, maybe I will grow to like it. Or hate it. It's hard to say.

The coffee was called Emilia. 

I bought some other cheap packages while at it. My favourite coffee costs 10 € at the moment, so I need a new favourite.

1kfwuel,https://www.reddit.com/r/okstorytime/comments/1kfwuel/my_cousin_is_being_shady/,My cousin is being shady,"So I'll start this off my saying one of my best friends is my cousin female 25 .  I female 27 moved back to my home town after spending several years traveling. We have always had a graat relationship talked on the phone for several hours a week sometimes per day. I've even flown home for a weekend.  I also flew her out around my birthday for 2 weeks. We play games together and have many hobbies we do together; like writing, watching the same shows, and reading the same books. We typically call just to talk and do house chores together. Well, I decided it was time to come home. I called her up and told her id be arriving in two or so months after I settle some things and that id be driving 2000 miles and shed see me soon. She told me not to come home in a manner that made me feel like she didnt want me to be there. She followed up by saying its because ive been so successful since I left our home state. I wasn't going to pause my plans of moving because I have other family id like to see. After arriving, it wasn't so awkward... as I thought it would be since she clearly didnt want me there. Well a month or so latter, I moved on to a childhood property of mine which features several  rentals. Her and her husband were having difficulties with they're living situation and we ended up agreeing to let them rent a house on the property. All seems to be going well at this point. I get a job working for the same company she is working for, except I was in a different location. All has gone well so far north weird comments. Then her work bff got fired and a position opened up. A position closer to home. I took the position because she said she was going to quit... and shes renting from my family and I felt like I had to take the job so she wouldnt quit. She decided working with me was awesome, it truly was. Everything was going smoothly for a while. And then my husband got a job working at the same place with her husband. They are also best friends. Which worked well. Because we all worked the same shifts. I drove her and I to work while her husband and mine drove to work. It was affordable for everyone. Well. Then the turn happened. Her husband was bad mouthing my husband to the bosses. And the bosses told my husband about it. And their relationship got toxic. He was nice out side of work; we planned things like lake days, camping trips, dinners. Me and my husband couldn't understand why he all of a sudden started a smear campaign at their job. Then my husband git a raise and a better position. We realized that maybe her husband wanted to be the star if the show. We shrugged it off, things seemed to calm down a bit. And things started seeming normal. Until her husband started getting mad at my husband for getting more hours and making friends with people at work. The work friends do not like her husband. They have all said that hes lazy and flirts with customers, and has gone above the managers and talked with the owners about getting a raise. My cousin says that her husband tells her how well he does at work and that hes going to be manager soon. Which turned out to be lies... he then started getting distant. And not wanting to enjoy everyones hobbies like before. Then came the day where my birthday came around. My birthday is the last birthday of the year in the friend group. And after making her husband a homemade dinner and got him a few gifts. And then when her birthday came around I spoiled the crap out of her with a homemade dinner of her choice and a bunch of small meaningful gifts. Then it was my birthday. We had all scheduled the day off and planned for a fun day. I wanted to go swimming and have a thrift shop day and to end it with a BBQ (which i paid for completely) and a bonfire. The day came and the pools were closed. That was fine. I sat at home with my cup of coffee waiting for everyone to show up. So we can start the day. My other bestie showed up who ive know my whole life who's also besties with my cousin. She was ready to rock n roll. We waiting two hours and heard nothing the day was coming close to an end and i really wanted to get to a couple places before they closed so we headed into town. We  shopped at multiple thrift stores. Found some real awesome deals. We still hadn't heard from my cousin. So we went home and headed up to the main house on the property where my birthday was going to be. My dad was grilling all the ribs I bought. My other family members had built a fire for me. About an hour goes by and its dark out its 9pm and my cousin finally shows up drunk with another friend of hers who ive never met. She said happy birthday . I asked her what happened earlier with going shopping and she said she made plans with her friend. I was so hurt. She never texted me. Didn't go out with me. Didn't have morning coffee with me. Waited till the last few hours of my birthday to show her self. Didn't get me anything. Showed up drunk with her friend who was plastered . I decided to make the best out of it and continue with my small party. She was present at my part for about an hour until she copped an attitude with another family member and left. For a whole month prior to my birthday we had planed a simple day. That started with coffee at my place then we'd go swimming and lay in a hot tub for a few,  then find something cool at a thrift shop and then head over to the main house for food and drinks. She helped plan every detail and barely showed up. I cried to my husband because I don't understand way she ignored me on my birthday... then about a month later she lashed out on me at work which has never happened up until then and we worked together for about a months at this point. And then a month latter it was my husband's birthday. No one said anything to him. I cooked and planned to have 30 or so people at our house for a BBQ bonfire. Not a single person showed up. I made 100 homemade cupcakes. And got him gifts and cleaned the house and got a fire built and his mother was the only person who said happy birthday to him besides me... the day after his birthday at 2 am her husband and her came over and said happy birthday to him ate a cupcake and left. They were a day late and showed up for 20 minutes. 

My cousin and I regardless of what beef our husbands have been having have scheduled weekly dates. Watch movies, do face masks, dye hair, drink. And these things have slowed down to barely anything. We planned things multiple times for her to make planes with someoneelse instead and ignore me on the day of said plans. Well I recently found out that shes been talking to my bestie about random things and saying things behind my back including her not wanting me at her wedding and how shes just going to go to the court house and get married and have her other bestie (the one she keeps ditching me for) be a witness. While also being two faced and talking to me about these things saying how grwtavits going to be. Meanwhile shes talking to my bestie about how pisses id be if I wake up one day and shes already married and I wasn't important enough to be there. Also shes been commenting on my weight gain because of a medical issue I've been experiencing while also trying to work with it. And disguising as a back handed compliment she also does this to my husband..  She no longer has date nights with me or our other bestie. She no longer plays games with my bestie and I. She just shows up drunk at 2 am and love bombs me while I know shes talking about me behind my back. I don't know what to say to her or what to do... I love her but this all feels like a stab in the heart and she treats me differently that the way she used to when we just talked on the phone ",1,1746508990.0,okstorytime,1,1.0,False

Gather around all for a story of a puzzling situation I was in tonight.

SO this round and red faced couple waddle in for their reservation. 

I greet them, I verify, and I begin the check-in.

The wife suddenly asks, ""oh by the way, we need a veterans discount.""

They booked through a third party. Yeah, not possable. 

I politely let the couple know that since they booked trough the TPI I cannot change the reservation and the price is locked in.

I was expecting either some sort of attitude, or in rare cases, a simple ""okay never mind.""

I didn't get any of these. In fact, I got nothing. No words. No sound. Just blank and vapid staring. 

I wasn't sure if this was a good sign or a bad one. So I just finished the check-in. The silence continued. It wasn't uncomfortable. More awkward then anything.

So I finish up. I give them the customer service smile. I go over where things are, again. Only because they didn't bother to turn their heads around to see me pointing to where the coffee machine and elevator etc were. They kept giving me blank looks.

I give them their key cards. They look inside the booklet.

The wife looks back up and, speaks. ""We needed a first floor room."" This wasn't framed as a question or, well, anything really. Just a monotone statement. 

Sooo, I explain we were just about full, and the only kind of room that they booked was not on the first floor.

The guests booked today. All the other rooms were booked much earlier. 

I said we didn't have any more rooms available on the first floor. I apologized as I didn't see any notes or requests in the reservation.

Again, there was silence, and staring. Lots of staring.

The husband kind of cleared his thoat. The wife was motionless.

I didn't say anything else while they stood there. NOW it was uncomfortable, because they weren't moving. They were just standing there at the front desk with the blank looks, again.

I finally broke the silence, ""is there anything else I can do for you?"" Again, I was really trying to be as warm amd polite as possible. 

Nothing. Just nothing.

God this felt like it went on forever, BUT THEN they just walked off. No words. No looks. Just silence.

I can usually get some sort of reading from guests, but not here.

I guess this wasn't a bad interaction, maybe they were angry. Maybe they weren't.

# Training

Last fall I finally broke through the sub-3 barrier in my fourth marathon and clocked a 2:54:59. As those who have accomplished this, it's the ultimate reward after grinding and coming close but not quite there (my previous three marathons were 3:07, 3:03 and 3:05). After recovering from a fall marathon, I entered a 12 week half block where I peaked my mileage around 100km and I ran my first sub-80min half (1:19:46) at the end of January. This gave me an excellent 14 week lead into BMO and a good gauge on my fitness.

The goal of the block BMO block was to increase my peak mileage from 115km in the fall to 120km and follow Jack Daniel's 2Q program. A modest increase, but something that I felt was manageable as I was still running everything as singles. I would also continue my two strength sessions per week. That included one home strength session where I followed Ben is Running's 30min core routine (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RN7-oOTIEw&pp=0gcJCdgAo7VqN5tD), and the other one is in the gym where I did ""heavy"" low rep deadlifts, Bulgarian split squats, Copenhagen bridges, hanging bent leg raises and heavy calf work.

The first five weeks of the training block went well and I was able to get through the first meso cycle. Foolishly, in the second week of the block I started to notice some pinching in my left arch on runs, but thought nothing of it. I traditionally take Monday off as Sunday is the traditional long run, the discomfort would usually completely dissipate on my day off and I'd hit the reset button so to speak. I thought it was just one of those niggles you deal with in training until it wasn't and after an innocuous 14km easy run, my foot completely blew up and I was hobbling around the house. Shit. I was injured.

The next few days I has a pitty party and did absolutely no exercise but ice and stretch my foot. Physio confirmed it was plantar fasciitis and that the timeline for a complete recovery was 8-12 weeks, but some people could take up to 12 months.

After seven days completely off running, I slowly began to reintroduce running and the next four weeks after the injury had mileage that looked like 30km/56km/90km respectively. All those miles were easy runs and I tried to maintain fitness on the elliptical by doing 75min sessions with 5x4min VO2 Max intervals twice a week. After the first four week post injury, I started to reincorporate some running intensity and while the platar fasciitis was still present, it was manageable as I diligently continued my nightly 20-25min rehab routine.

Four weeks out I tried my first long run workout with was to be 30km with 4x5km at marathon pace. The goal was to run the reps at 4:13km to see how the body felt. The first two reps were hard, and then the unimaginable happened as I tried to take a flight of stairs two-by-two and my foot slipped off the step and I went over on my ankle. Shit. I aborted the run and was in a state of disbelief. Just as I felt like I was getting back to a rhythm in training another injury hits. Luckily, the roll wasn't as bad as originally intended and I was only out for a couple of days, but it meant that I wasn't doing any sort of running intensity for yet another week as the ankle felt like it couldn't handle any sort of load like that.

By the time the taper came, I felt super discouraged. The last six weeks had been a perpetual state of recovering from injury, or being injured. Based on my original 14 week plan, I had missed out on about 240km worth of running specific training to deal with the injuries and let me body recover. To help calm my woes, I decided to indulge in some retail therapy. The past two years I had been using the Saucony Endorphin Pro 2s that I found on an Amazon reseller for $140 as my race shoes. They were awesome, but were being transitioned to a trainer so I decided to get the Adios Pro 4s. What. A. Shoe. Whatever happened in the race, at least I would have something on my foot that looked fast, regardless of how fast I was going.

# Pre-race and Nutritional Lead Up

Last fall was the first time I was really methodical about carbo loading and used a 3-day stepped approach of 500/600/700gr of carbs 3/2/1 days out from race day. For reference I am 6'0"" and 165lbs so these carb amounts were right in the range of expected carb ingestion based on body weight and the latest literature.

From racing of over half a decade now, I've also dialed in my pre-race routine and it doesn't waver too much for half or full marathon racing. The fueling that really works for me is as follows and based on the 8:30am start time for BMO:

Breakfast

1. **5:30am**

\- 3/4 cups dry (cooked) (456kcal)

\- 1 cup orange juice (120kcal)

\- 1 Tbsp honey (60kcal)

\- 900ml water with LMNT pack

2. **7:15am**

\- 1 large coffee

3. **7:45am**

\- 1 banana (100kcal)

4. **8:15am**

\- Xact bar (100kcal)

\- couple more swigs of water

The total before race start was 209 grams of carbs or 860kcal.

Luckily, the start line was only 2km from my house so I had my wife drive me within 500m about 30min before race start. I know, I'm lazy. Trying to conserve every last step. After walking to the pee troughs and letting out the last bit of expendable weight, I did a quick 5min jog with a couple of strides. I could feel the tightness in my left arch from the plantar fasciitis and just hoped that my body would hold out until the finish line.

# Race

As I lined up on the start line, I remembered that three years ago I stood in the exact same spot as I started my very first marathon. How much have I improved over the past three years as a runner? In 2022, I finished in 3:07 and learned so many important lessons on my maiden marathon that I would be applying on this race day.

To section the race into more manageable bite-sized pieces, I've found lapping every 5km and keeping the lap details on my watch face to be very beneficial mentally as the cumulative time is too daunting. If you have a bad split, that's ok, you forget about it as your watch only focuses on the current 5km split.

There were two benchmarks I had set for myself pre-race. Since the first bit of the course was downhill, I wanted to bank some time and go through 5km in 20:00. If all went to plan the next benchmark was going through half in 1:28:00. As I pressed lap on my watch for the first time, I went through 5km in 19:48; a tad fast but within range. I took my first of five gels, and the first of two caffeine gels.

Vancouver is such an undulating course, it's not until kilometer 11 where the course has it's first stretch of true flat ground and that's where I could gauge what felt comfortable for pacing. My goal of 2:57 meant flats were to be run at 4:12min/km (6:45min/mile) pace. When I looked down at my watch to see what pace I was settling into, the pace was 4:04min/km (6:32min/mile). I tried to not get too excited and told myself that I'm probably in store for a positive split today and that there was still about 70% of the race left. I took another gel.

After going through the UBC campus, I started to collect people as we descended down to Jericho beach. We came up to the half way point timing mat; 1:24:59. What. How am I three minutes ahead of planned pacing? At that point I thought I'm either in for an unreal day, or an incredible blow up in about 10km. I take my second caffeine gel.

At 28km, the first twinges of muscle failure start and my hamstring starts to feel tight right under the right butt cheek. Despite this, it's a confidence boost as the last marathon I ran those muscle twinges started about 10km earlier. I take my fourth gel.

At 32km, the course goes onto the Seawall and begins the death march around Stanley Park. With 10km left I tell myself just over 40min left of racing. I get a boost from all the people I am catching as people start hitting the wall (as a side note, I went through half in 129th place based on the results and ultimately passed 34 people in the second half of the race).

At 35km, I take my last planned gel and tell myself only 28 minutes left of racing. I'm thoroughly in the pain cave and start to do some rudimentary mental math in an attempt to see what my estimate finish time is. I realize I have an outside chance of breaking 2:50. Holy shit. Time to put my head down and embrace the pain.

The last 2.2km of the race were agony. I had worked out that to have a chance at sub-2:50 I needed to go through 40km in 2:40:30 to give me 9:30 for the last 2.2km in case I really went off the rails. The course turned south and was met with a head wind, which in reality was a light breeze, but at the time felt like gale force winds preventing me from moving forward. 

I finally turned the final corner and saw the finish banner 600m ahead. With 150m left I was able to see the clock for the first time and it said 2:49:30. I emptied the tank to get to the finish in the next 30 seconds. I crossed the line at 2:49:52. Chip time: 2:49:49 and 10 second negative split. 95th out of 6883.

# Post-race

The body is mangled, but it was totally worth it. The plantar fasciitis was held at bay thankfully. I'm still at a loss for how I managed to pull that off. Absolutely nothing in my training said I was remotely in that shape. I lost 30% of the prescribed long runs and workouts to injury over the past 14 weeks. My physio did mention that sometimes those who get injured mid-block perform quite well because it's like they have two tapers. I was a little skeptical when he mentioned that at the time, but I'm putting a little more weight into it now.

Looking back at my first marathon on the exact same course in 2022, I've gone from a 3:07 to 2:50 in 36 months. A 17min improvement is something I'm very proud of and a testament to the saying ""consistency is king"".

With Chicago now five months away it's time to recover, hop into a mini 10km 8-week block to practice turning over the legs a bit before another summer of high mileage.",9,1746508582.0,AdvancedRunning,2,1.0,False

Privately, I have a few select friends and a loving family. I am happy with my life in general. 


I am however occasionally reminded at work that I am a social outsider. When I come to the office I am trying to put on a mask but that requires lots of energy and I can’t really maintain it; I see others being naturally social, there is a strong group community in my team, but I cannot keep up with it. I try, but I overthink and overreact to any and all sign of being ignored or excluded, real or imagined. A typical example could be that I notice people leave for a coffee break, chatting and laughing, but they perhaps didn’t ask me to join. Then I feel very excluded and cannot make myself go and sit down with them. 


Im writing this partly out of frustration with an ongoing HR workshop that forces me to expose my social awkwardness again. *HR is weaponised extroversion* 😝

The sort that really makes you think - is this process and all this pain worth it?

Long story short, I spoke to a guy over the weekend. It was an hour long call and things seemed very decent, he seemed to be an outspoken but earnest person. 

Yesterday, in the morning he texted me out of the blue saying he wanted to meet. I'm a person who likes to plan her day a bit, so this was out of the unknown for me, but I decided to go ahead with it because he was from another city and had come to mine for some work, it's not everyday that this happens. I was initially going to work from home but the area he was going to be in was close to my office, so I decided to go to work first and meet him directly afterwards. We decided on a time and place for coffee. 

Fast forward to an hour before the meeting, I texted to confirm the plan. He said ""Wait in office, will ping you after my meeting.""

So I waited, until my office got practically empty and it felt weird to remain alone. After an hour, I called him, to check if he was getting late, we'd have to postpone as I couldn't wait in office any longer. He answered the call and casually said ""Yes my plans have changed, let's meet at another place (opposite end of the city). You pick a cafe and let me know."" This new location was extremely far from my office and close to my home. I was a bit irritated because had I known, I would have worked from home itself instead of waiting endlessly in a deserted office building!
Suddenly I was left scrambling - this was quite a drastic change. I left work, simultaneously picked a decent cafe and texted him the address. By then, the peak hour rush had started in the trains and I somehow managed to get into one. Since I travelled by local train, he told me to meet me at the station itself. 

When I reached the station, I called him. He said - reaching in 10 minutes. 

I ended up waiting for 35 minutes for him on the platform, hot and bothered and tired, with office bags, being stared at by random strangers. 
He came along, swinging his arms as if nothing had happened. We took a cab to the restaurant and then the nitpicking started. 

""I expected you to pick a better cafe, why this one?""
""You Mumbaikars don't have an enthusiasm for new places!""
""Why are you so tired to walk, you guys walk a lot."" (He conveniently didn't see I had one laptop bag with a ton of things while he had just a wallet).
""Mumbai sucks, the humidity is terrible. I hate the heat, such a miserable and dirty city, look at mine, the crowd is so much better!""
""You're a food blogger? How many followers do you have? Only 600? You don't even have enough engagement, that's not blogging then. You're not a blogger in the true sense!""
""Do you eat this slowly?""
""Only child? Ah, you must be pampered.""
""How many boys are you talking to right now? You girls have it so easy, being a guy is so tough!""
""The water in Mumbai tastes so bad!""
""How slow is the service here? Will they get our food tomorrow?"" - then made a few more rude comments to the waiters. 

Here was an individual, who absolutely refused to apologise for being late, refused to see that I had complied with his entire day's schedule, waited for two hours to meet him including being all hot and tired on the railway platform for 40 minutes, forget saying sorry, he did not even acknowledge his mistake. His only job was to nitpick, nitpick, nitpick. Also, every city has its own problems but if you're visiting someone's hometown to meet them, is it really to know them as a person or simply to bash their place of birth and complain about every single thing in that city? Every sentence started with a complaint or a sense of superiority complex. I kept my dignity and left as fast as I could - and never contacted him after that. 

And after that I really took a pledge and promised myself - I will remain single but never end up with an individual like this person.

I'm 39 F. Ex 41 M. 

I have an apartment in a house that is split up into 3 units. I have a small yard that I share with the neighbors on our left side, also a house that is split up into units. Altogether, there are roughly 11 apartments that share this yard. 

I've been dating my ex for roughly 9 months. He doesn't live with me, but has practically 'moved in'. All his stuff is here etc. 

Today was one of the first days we've had some decent weather. I live up north and spring has finally decided to creep in. I decided to make the most of it. Slapped on some sunscreen and decided to lie in the yard. I have a lawn lounger that I pulled out of storage. I made myself a nice iced coffee and a snack plate of cheese and crackers. I had my earbuds in and was really getting into my favorite podcast. I dozed off. 

The next thing I know my BF is screaming like a maniac. I was just coming out of a nice warm doze and I wasn't sure what was happening at first. My boyfriend is screaming at 3 kids. (ages 5-11) My neighbor is a divorced Dad and shares custody with his EX. I don't know why he had them on a Monday, but that wasn't the point. My ex was yelling at these kids bc they were in 'his yard staring at his girlfriend'. 

I get up and tell him to knock it off.  They were the neighbor kids and had every right to be using the yard. He goes off on me... Yells at me for wearing nothing. 

Now what I was wearing was my swimsuit. Shorts that are a little higher than mid-thigh and a sweetheart haltertop. I have worn similar things to summer church outings. My boobs, butt, and entire middrift was covered. I'm nearing 40, and I'm not dumb enough to be out there flaunting my cellulite.  Even if I was in something scandalous, I've never dressed to the dictates of anyone.  I told him so. He exploded. 

He said that those MFing kids were staring and I needed to go inside. I said they were staring bc he was acting like a complete idiot. The youngest child was in tears, chimed up and said they weren't staring, they just wanted to know if they could have some of my snacks. Fair enough. I told my BF he needed to leave and that I'd text later. 

This wasn't good enough for my BF. He stormed over to his truck. I thought he was getting ready to leave. Fine, I didn't know where this unexpected anger came from and I was not willing to continue the fight. I turned to give the kids my cheese and crackers and gathered up my tablet, earbuds, and coffee. I went inside, dropped those on the counter and went back out to put away the lounger. 

This is where things went from a 7 to an Oh Hell No. The kids were screaming. I turn the corner and find my boyfriend chasing one of the kids around the yard. The oldest kid had run inside to get their dad, and the youngest was nowhere to be seen. Crackers and cheese were scattered across the yard and my boyfriend was chasing this kid with shit in his hand.  

My Boyfriend had lost his damned mind. Gone to his truck. Took a shit in his hand and decided the best thing to do was confront these kids with shit while I was inside. I couldn't believe what was going on just in the minute I'd left. I picked up the plate that had the cheese on it and hurled it like a boomerang at his head. (it missed) I was screaming to get the F out, he was crazy, we were done. I was calling the police. I went feral. I picked up the lounger and while it was too heavy to actually throw I made a good attempt. 

This is when neighbor dad comes out and he's like WTF? He was completely confused at what was happening and I don't blame him. From his perspective his neighbor was fighting with her BF and his kids just needed to get inside. He did not see the shit. 

I think bc Dad neighbor came outside my ex realized he was outnumbered? Not sure what was going on in his mind. He thows his shit log at kid (misses) and then runs for his truck. 

I was in shock, I think. I had no clue where this sort of psycho behavior came from. I'm crying, thinking the first thing I needed to do was clean up the mess. While I'm having my meltdown kid is telling his dad what had happened. I tell him to go ahead and call the police, if he didn't do it I would. 

I go inside and get my phone. I also grab bags to clean up the mess. I'm sobbing, instead of calling the police, I call my sister and I just flip out. This conversation took about 10 mins. I calmed down enough to go outside and clean up. 

Dad neighbor meets me outside. He said he got the kids calmed down and he asks me what happened. I told him. He agrees to call the police as this sort of thing should be reported. He wasn't certain about the legalities of what had just happened since no actual physical contact was made with the kids. Was it assault? Was it not? Neither of us knew. I assured my neighbor I was 100% on board with getting the police involved as I was no longer going to be seeing my now Ex. 

I cleaned the crackers and cheese out of the yard and debated with the neighbor about whether I should leave the dook where it was for evidence. While I was standing there debating the log in the yard my phone goes off. I think it is my sister and I check it. It was not. 

My Ex's mother had messaged me. This is the exchange. 

EXM-What is going on EX just showed up and said you broke up. 

Me- He came to my place and we think he assaulted 3 kids. Waiting on cops. 

I waited a bit for a reply but the cops pulled in just at that moment. 

Me- cops are here. 

And that was the end of the exchange with my exs mother and during the police reports and everything, I sort of forgot about it. Ex will probably be booked into the jail for a day, then released until he goes to court. What he did is considered assault on a minor even if he didn't actually make any physical contact. So there's that. He'll likely have to pay fines or something. 

Here's where I might have been the Asshole. I never followed up with his mother. I told her her son had assaulted 3 kids and just left it. I wasn't trying to be malicious. I took a gummie to calm down after everything with the police and took a bath. My sister came over and together we began packing all the stuff he'd been keeping at my house. I wasn't looking at my phone and in my defence, it didn't ring. (All the communications were via text until his sister called.) 

I got a phone call from my Ex's sister. She asked what had happened and I told her. She yelled at me for not checking my messages. Her mother had had a heart attack and they were in the ER. Their mom believed that my ex had sexually assaulted the kids. She had jumped to her own conclusion on that, but when I didn't text back after she messaged she thought I was confirming it. She got into a fight with her son and he took off. She felt chest pain and called an ambulance and now mom is being worked on and sister got super pissy with me. I said I'm sorry shes in the ER but she should be blaming her brother for attacking kids with shit. I then hung up on her. 

Now looking at my texts I feel bad. I can see the escalation of the panicked texts his mom was sending me. She really believed her son had sexually assaulted 3 kids and was frantically trying to get me to answer her. Why didn't she just call? I don't know. 

I talked to my sister and she thinks I was in the wrong after looking at my response to his mom. She says she can see how my response could be taken far worse than it was. I don't think I'm wrong perse, because she's the one who jumped to the worst conclusion. We both agree that the majority of the blame falls on my EX, but that I may have had a minor part to play in his mother having a heart attack. I do feel bad about that, but I keep coming back to why didn't she just call?

I'll keep it short and sweet. This happened during COVID lockdown, so I was 29 at the time (zero experience).

I was still working during lockdown as I do deliveries. This girl I deliver to, who I'd never spoken to prior, leaves her number on her door for me.

Instant panic but I push through. She keeps inviting me over to hers and we're sat there on her bed watching films and smoking. This goes on for about four months. Her sat there waiting for me to make a move and me sat there like a lemon thinking about how awkward it'd be if I try anything.

Eventually she got bored and moved away. Not before I'd bought her a coffee machine for her birthday, told her I was a virgin then topped it off by asking her via text ""Do you think women would find it unattractive if someone my age hadn't been kissed yet?"".

Needless to say, I'm still a virgin at the age of 34. I don't think anyone would suspect this is the case as I don't think I'm a bad looking dude and I used to be a bodybuilder. I've had women ask me out in the past but I always managed to fuck it up.

I think it actually took more effort to fuck that up than it would have done to actually try.

Moral of the story is, if a girl gives you her number and keeps inviting you over, she probably doesn't just want to watch television. I probably wouldn't disclose the fact I'm a virgin in future. Really is just too weird at this age.

Really fucked up any remaining confidence I had at that age so I've not tried since. Been five years.

I was quite ill growing up so missed a year of high school, never comfortable socialising. Used to vomit from anxiety so couldn't go on dates etc.",1,1746506573.0,virgin,2,0.67,False

**About me:**

* I am 26
* 5'11"" and 220 lbs (average-fit build)
* Grey-Blue eyes with shorter dark blond hair
* Have a degree in Physics with all kinds of awards relating to that
* Always have worked full time even during college
* Not rich as I make $35k/year, but I fully paid off my own home and buy cheap used cars
* My favorite things to do are astronomy and long motorcycle trips

**My dating dilemma:**

I have used maybe about a dozen different apps off/on since 2019. Currently on Tinder, Facebook Dating, Bumble, Boo, and Hinge. Even pay subscriptions for all of them except Facebook Dating and Hinge. These days I get 1-3 matches a day with about 1 in 10 responding back to me. Very few I had the opportunity to text for couple of weeks.

Once in awhile I will meet some woman in real life I really like and find a way to get their socials/number in not some creepy way. Some of those I can get some long term text conversations but whenever it comes about just meeting up for coffee or something, there's always something saying they can't. Eventually I just let those go as they made it clear they are not interested in a date.

I met someone on Bumble where we were texting for 3 weeks straight. Just overall seemed wonderful. She was a RN at a local hospital and doing a masters degree, but in the first week she managed to ask ME to meet for coffee. She said had a day off in 2 weeks to meet at this coffee place at 11am on Monday (4/21). She even said she could meet sooner but ""I deserve more than 30 minutes to meet"". Everything seemed to going great up to 4/19 where I get her last text of ""It was a hella night at work. Better get to bed goodnight"". Figured she was busy but still sent her a text on 4/20 asking if she still planning on meeting. I show up on 4/21 and waited for 2 hours. Nothing at all. Asked if she was okay by text and by Bumble message. Still nothing now.

That last one really made me sad thinking I finally had a chance. Even seemed went out of her way to fit me into her busy schedule. I wish I could get some honest answers/advice on what I can do differently.

**What I have done so far:**

I use the same 6 pictures of me for everything. Carefully picking ones that show me with my interests and achievements.

* One picture of me presenting at a astrophysics conference
* Two pictures of me with my motorcycle at different landmarks in the background
* One picture me at an old observatory
* One bathroom mirror selfie
* And one of me on my roof doing roofing

When I get a match, I'm 90% of the time start asking something about their interests or something I can pick up from their pictures. Just trying to start some kind of conversation with something I put 2 minutes into thinking about. Normally it is no response or single response back.

I have figured out long ago that if you asked for a hookup, that's a immediate unmatched. So I think most likely they are reading messages?

If I send the first message asking to meet somewhere for coffee, I think I get better chances of a response. Thought it almost always is no, can't, idk, etc.

I have a lot of bad stories involving other people and dating that I could go on about. I just want ONE date and I am realizing that I spent years doing so. Maybe I can get a new idea here.",1,1746506385.0,Advice,3,0.99,False

 in the microwave’s mouth

            like ritual reheated

 for the fourth, fifth time

 something small to spin.

 around

 and around

 some days i think God talks to me,

 some days i think i am God,

 most days,

 i think i am tired

            by the same endless spiral.

# GENERAL AGENDA:

1. Meet at cafe at x time. I'm the host shmoji. I will be sitting at a table with my laptop out, but feel free to sit anywhere. Feel free to comment here if cant find us.
2. Get coffee or buy something from the shop for gifting us with the space.
3. For 2 hours, just do whatever you want. Art, study, chat, scroll social media, etc. That's about it. Do what feels alive for you.

If you want to focus, be explicit with people that you dont want them to chat you up. And just be respectful of others.

I wanted to see who might be around for breeding, or just a fun night(s) together. Irl or online ;) bonus if you're in Boston or San Diego.

A little about me, white, bwc, and a nice dad bod. I love a good cocktail, and I want to make sure you're always put first.

Id love to get you dinner, or coffee, and then we can spend every night or lunch enjoying the process. I prefer younger than me.",2,1746505481.0,YoungerGirl4OlderMen,0,1.0,False
1kfvwi0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kfvwi0,Small Living Space Layout – Is There a Better Option?,"Hey all,
I’m working with a pretty tight space and trying to make the most of it. I’ve sketched out a layout that includes a dining table, couch, coffee table, and TV stand—but I’m wondering if there’s a smarter or more efficient way to arrange it.

It feels like this might be the only setup that works, but open to any ideas or tweaks I might’ve missed. Appreciate any feedback!",4,1746505410.0,malelivingspace,1,0.84,False

Wondering if anyone has any ideas on which (pike place, cap hill, fremont etc) area is best for a walkable coffee crawl and if you have any recs on your fav coffee shops? 

  
Or any ideas on a scavenger hunt in Seattle is on my list as well. 

  
Thank you :)",2,1746505252.0,Seattle,11,0.67,False
1kfvui5,https://www.reddit.com/r/harvestmoon/comments/1kfvui5/question_about_hm_ds_when_does_the_coffee_table/,Question about HM DS when does the coffee table show up?,I recently started playing this game again and I was wondering if there’s any way to make the coffee table show up so I can upgrade my house. I even bought the tool box and the clock on TV shopping because I thought surely then it would show up but still nothing:‘) only this translator thing shows up. I also tried to reload my save file but no coffee table… is it glitch ? Or I am just doing something wrong?,1,1746505207.0,harvestmoon,1,1.0,False
