1lib36w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lib36w,Weekend wandering trip to Paris!,"We booked a room at the Secret De Paris hotel in Montmartre and had booked a show at the Moulin Rouge on the Saturday night, other than that we had no real plan (or idea) what we‚Äôd do!

We arrived at CDG at 5PM, pre booked a taxi through the rush hour traffic, arrived at 7ish where we dumped the bags and headed out for a walk to the river. Food was in abundance, as was the sunshine!!! Amazing how many of the sights you see just from walking about with no direction or clue where you‚Äôre going!!

Saturday decided to stroll around Montmartre. Croissants and coffee at a little jazz cafe, stroll around the cemetery and then followed the crowds to the Sacre Coeur for one of the best views of a city we‚Äôve ever experienced, a picture wouldn‚Äôt do it justice! Queues to go inside weren‚Äôt too bad but it was early.

Decided to venture up to the Saint Ouen flea market, antiques are our sort of thing and I feel like one most days. What an interesting place!! It‚Äôs surrounded by people selling fake AirPods, iPads and other ‚Äústuff‚Äù but nobody was pushy and had a laugh with a few of the sellers. The markets a bit further in were great, so many interesting finds and excellent food spots - found a great veggie burger joint for the wife üëç

It was now baking hot so opted for the Metro back. Now my French isn‚Äôt brilliant but whilst we were queuing for a ticket a gentlemen did try to help get tickets on my phone, didn‚Äôt work but in broken dialects we had a good laugh! No problem though, day passes sorted and we went back to Montmartre for refreshments in a bar. Picked up some baguettes, cheese, ham and a bottle of wine from a supermarket for tea! 

Moulin Rouge was amazing. Tourist trap? Absolutely but we had a great evening and as we‚Äôve planned to go for years it was a big tick in the box. Now though, the star of the show‚Ä¶

Unbeknown to us until someone mentioned it on a previous post, it was the Fete De La Musique which meant there were several DJ‚Äôs setup around our hotel where we danced away until the early hours. Such a good vibe, equally such a shame to read the reports yesterday but at the same time we‚Äôre planning to be back for it at some point

Took the airport bus back from Op√©ra yesterday, a lot easier and meant we could take in some extra sights beforehand on the walk down.

Overall, just amazing! People were super helpful and friendly wherever we went, great food pretty much everywhere you go and just loved every single minute. It was nice not having a schedule and just wandering about, seeing what you bump into and taking it all in. 

We did learn a few things along the way, definitely be back in the near future!!

1lib1vp,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1lib1vp/discipline_and_indiscipline/,Discipline and indiscipline.,"Just few days back for straight 3 days, I was working on myself, getting up at 5:30, drinking water, working out for an hour, meditation, shower, breakfast with first coffee, study by 8:30-9:00 till 11:30, take a quick nap of 30 mins and drink second coffee and next I know I was studying till lunch at 12:30 and after an hour break, I would get back to my studying without feeling sleepy or lazy and after few breaks and a good dinner. I would be on bed by 10:30 pm.

And now, due to some personal reasons, I ended up sleeping late, waking up late, missing out on everything above and after lunch, I feel so sleepy.
My cortisol feels messed up.

1lib1pg,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1lib1pg/help_needed_for_beginner_2000/,Help needed for beginner [<2000‚Ç¨],"Hello fellow coffee lovers :)

Im fedup with boring capsule coffee and want to dive in to the fancy world of espresso, latte art and getting angry about a lack of pressure, acidy coffe (just kidding. I want to buy an espresso machine).

I'm located in Southern Germany.

My requirements are that the machine is not super huge, that is not super expensive and if it is rather quick to heat up and does not consume too much energy that would be a nice addon. I will mainly consume 1 or 2 espressi in the morning and one cappucino for my wife and another 1 or 2 for lunch. After that the machine will stay off, unless we have guests which is roughly every weekend, but normally not more than 4 guests. So I will not need a  machine that is capable of producing 200 shots an hour :)

I already had a look at the Quickmill Luna and had a chat with a local coffee shop. They told me that they have a lot of issues with damaged thermoblocks and that they dont live very long

The next option I liked is the Rocket Appartamento but here the long heat up time and the (seemingly) neceersay tinkering to get good pressure and temperature keeps me kind of away from it.

Currently my favorite is the the Lelit Mara X V2, since it heats up rather quick, has good reviews, PID and is compact.

  
For the grinder my preference would be the Eureka MIGNON SPECIALITA. Any feedback on that or is there a better grinder for the money?

Thank you for any input, looking forward to a good discusison!",1,1750666440.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

My ""recipe"" for this is 18g coffee to 300g just boiled water, 60g bloom for 30s with a slight swirl then one slow pour for the rest in concentric circles until 300g.

I recently purchased an SS 155 so I can make smaller portions and I've done a lot of experimenting but can't seem to get the same results as the 185 with the same beans. I've kept to the same ratio but tried changing a lot of other variables. I initially used the same grind size but the result was extremely weak with little flavour. I've tried a few finer grind settings which helped a bit to get some more acidity out but also came with more bitterness. I tried reducing the water temp to around 90-91¬∞C but that didn't seem to help. The result is always muddy and lacking in clarity and acidity. Can anyone offer some advice to help diagnose/fix the issue?

I'm not as bent out of shape about small things (someone at work doesn't invite me to have a coffee and I crash out). 

The only battle I have left is sharing with other people. I'm currently lodging with a longtime friend. Last year I was sharing with someone that was very passive aggressive (would sulk a lot) and would only notice my mess and not their own. Now I'm trying not to fall into old patterns because my friend is doing me a favour but maaaaaan does noone recognise that they are just as messy as other people. 

Neither of us are that messy but it's the little things. They will leave plates out after dinner and instead of mentioning something I'll just put it in the dishwasher (another example is that they shed a lot of hair and I'll just sweep and put it in the bin) but if the shoe was on the other foot and I had left a couple of personal items downstairs then it gets collected up in a small pile despite the fact that they have left a lot of their things out.

My friend will also make small comments rather than addressing a problem straight on and sometimes it's about stuff that isn't really their business. For example, oh you own a lot of jackets. Like why is that your business? I don't leave them downstairs. 

At the end of the day these are very small problems and I'm doing a lot better about letting the small things go. It's just my friend is starting to remind me of my toxic ex flatmate.

 I think what I've realised is I am a lot more forgiving about things I find annoying in other people/flatmates but then get upset that they don't have the same courtesy and feel the need to bring up the small things.

1liaxb2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1liaxb2/th_grandmas_confessions/,[TH] Grandmas Confessions,"My first COMPLETE short story, nothing at all special, more so interested in how you feel about the story than the writing, I know that has a lot of improvement to be made, anyways it‚Äôs real short 1.3k thriller/confessional ~

‚ÄúI have a confession to make before I go‚Äù, she whispered. The granddaughter began to make an objection to this notion, but was quieted with stern eyes she rarely received from her grandmother. An always transparent and positive ambassador for life. She had a successful career, managing bands and singers. ‚ÄúYou remember, my first artist‚Äú she asked and of course she did.

  Her first client was her most famous, and how she broke into the industry. She told her that story before. About how she was waiting tables and waiting for this guy she‚Äôd been seeing to finally propose, so she could get pregnant and stop working. What was proposed instead, from a stranger no less, turned out to be far more lucrative. 

  A skinny man, always in the same black denim jacket, sometimes different pants, was dining regularly at the restaurant she worked at. Always alone, always at the bar, and only ever for a cup of coffee. He carried a guitar case with him. Mary wondered if the case even contained any instrument at all. She thought more likely he is living out of that case of clothes, and God knows what else. Until one night, she was on her way out to her car and that same man sat on the curb, guitar case cracked and empty. He was strumming on the old beat up thing well enough, but that wasn‚Äôt what stopped her. She wanted to ignore him on first instinct, but before she could make it to her car, he began to sing. 

  She was captivated by his voice. They stayed in that parking lot until the sun rose. Him telling her his dreams, to be a star, and his plan to make it happen. She was captivated, apparently she had always harboured similar dreams, figured everyone did. This was the first person she met doing anything about it. She wanted in.

  They spent the next week researching venues and bars looking for performers. She got him a job washing dishes, and every night after work they discussed their plans. She would manage the shows, the dates, the details, he would keep honing his craft, writing songs and developing his voice. The two grew close through this. Although Grandma always denied having slept with this artist, she talked now of how close the two had become at their start.

  It took about five years from the time they hit the road together, to the time they were listening to him on the radio. Today Jamison is recognized as one of the most influential artists of his generation. A fresh take on pop, darker and more exhilarating, while maintaining the fun, addictive quality that makes pop music pop. If you ever paid enough attention to the lyrics, you'd be surprised to find you were singing about death and domination, but you wouldn‚Äôt stop.

   Mary and Jamison spent every day of those pre-fame years on the road together. With, for a time, one addition. 

  He found them at the end of their first tour. Mary saw him in the crowd at the beginning of the night and paused at the resemblance, but the bar was dark enough, she didn‚Äôt think much about it. After the show on their way out to the car, he approached. In the floodlight she watched Jamison approach Jamison ‚Äúyou‚Äôre my fucking twin,‚Äù he said like he could hardly believe it. But the proof was right there, they were identical down to the gait. The reunion was awkward at first. Mary wondered if she should give him privacy, but it quickly became exciting to watch. Daniel was the twins name. They had it all in common. 

  Daniel had grown up here in Wyoming. He was a mechanic by trade, but more passionately; a singer. Daniel seemed fascinated with Jamison. Most of all with his pursuit of fame. Maybe Jamison was feeling guilty at his success, or just wanted to share it with his doppelganger, ‚Äúcome with me‚Äù he offered him. 
‚ÄúLike traveling twins?‚Äù Daniel laughed at the idea adding, ‚ÄúDuos don‚Äôt get famous, we‚Äôd need a united front.‚Äù 

This sparked an idea in Jamison, ‚ÄúOh it‚Äôs perfect! We‚Äôll split shows and stage time, we‚Äôll pull a fast one on the whole damn scene.‚Äù Jamison seemed ignited by the absurdity of this ‚Äòcon‚Äô.

  The plan struck stange to Mary, but obliged no less. And so that‚Äôs what they did. They finished their tour together ‚Äì performing each at their own shows, sometimes taking turns on the stage at the same one, after a quick change in the back. Mary would help undress and redress the other as fast she could, sometimes forgetting who she was undressing and who she was redressing. They did two more tours like this, each in a better venue with more turnout than the one before. They were high on this prank, it was harmless and exhilarating.

  By this time, Mary had given up her plan of being a stay at home wife. Now she shared her dream with the twins ‚Äì she just wanted them to get bigger and bigger. She wanted the world to hear their voice, to see in one what she was lucky enough to see in two. 

  It was at the end of the third tour that an agent approached Mary. An agent from a prestigious label Mary recognized, the one Jamison is still with today.. This could be it, she thought. He‚Äôs done it. After the excitement of that epiphany wanned, she realized the predicament she was in. The agent offerent one contract, after all, no one knew about Daniel, they had kept that behind the scenes, and quite well until this point. She knew there was no conning the Academy Awards, the Grammy, the Arenas, the Live shows he would go on to perform. 

  She waited until she had Jamison alone, and told him what had been offered, and the concerns she had. Jamison understood the fear, and together he decided to let Daniel down easy at the end of the tour, tell him the jig is up, and he‚Äôd have to go find his own way. The fact of the matter was that Jamison and Mary were the reason Daniel got to do any tours at all, and for that, he should be grateful. Mary agreed, and was relieved Jim felt comfortable handling the situation on his own. She imagined what she would feel if this life she came to live was taken from her so suddenly. It sank her stomach, she couldn't handle the idea. Daniel was an easy-going guy for the most part, but this would be hard for anyone to accept.

  The night after the last show, they were staying in a motel. They drank a couple cases of beer and smoked a pack of cigarettes collectively. When Daniel turned into his room first, Jamison told Mary to head to bed, he‚Äôd go break the news. But her room was right next to Davids, and she stayed up with her ear against the wall. 

  She heard the mumblings rise to shouts, making out only fragments  ‚Äúyou couldn‚Äôt have‚Äù ‚Äúwithout me‚Äú ‚Äúmechanic‚Äù ‚Äúonly here‚Äù ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going back‚Äù ‚Äúnot touring as me anymore‚Äù and then the shouting returned to muffled noises, and then it was quiet again. 

  The next morning, nervous to face Daniel, Mary waited in the van. Hoping Jamison would join first and be able to give Mary a quick rundown of Daniel's reception and what mood to expect of him. And while the body that appeared in front of Mary was dressed in Jamison‚Äòs clothes, smelled of his cologne, and walked with his gait, a chill ran through her body. 

‚ÄúDaniel?‚Äù she asked. 
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know who you‚Äôre talking about‚Äù, he said and heaved a suitcase bursting at the seams into the back seats. Sliding the door closed and climbing into the front seat beside her.
‚ÄúNow, tell me about this agent.‚Äù

On the day I was supposed to get my marriage license, I found myself at city hall bright and early, waiting from 8 AM until it closed.

Just as I was walking out, feeling the curious stares from the crowd, I got a message from Austin Herrera, saying something had come up at work, and we'd need to reschedule. ac

When I got back to our empty house, I opened my phone and saw an Instagram post from Austin's childhood sweetheart: \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\]

The photo showed a beautiful scene on an island, and in the corner, I could still see a guy with a well-defined physique.

Scrolling through the comments, it was all compliments and a bit of playful envy about having such a great friend.

After giving the post a like, I decided to reach out to my friend. \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

I'd been in love with Austin for six years, and during that time, I'd transformed from a young girl into a woman nearly thirty.

My family had been all about the wedding talk, and I kept bringing up marriage with Austin, but he always seemed to put it off.

Just when I thought I might be done waiting, he surprised me by proposing in public not too long ago.

Today was supposed to be the big day for us to get our license.

Two days ago, my mom called out of the blue, saying, ""Sweetie, I consulted someone, and they say the day after tomorrow is a perfect day for you to get your license.""

I couldn't help but laugh, and of course, Austin heard me. He pulled me into a warm embrace and assured me he was all in for anything I needed.

But then, right before our license appointment yesterday, he suddenly started packing his bags for a business trip. Before he left, he gently ruffled my hair and said, ""Don't worry, it's just for a day. I'll definitely be back in time.""

Looking into his calm eyes, I held back the words I wanted to say. I just smiled as I dropped him off at the airport, feeling happy. Even last night when we talked, he swore he was already at the airport.

Today, I woke up early, put on some light makeup, and headed to the city hall with my driver's license in hand. I couldn't help but daydream about the amazing life we'd have together.

As time ticked by, the fresh rose in my hand slowly wilted. I called Austin multiple times, but none of my calls went through, and I couldn't shake the worry that something might have happened to him.

I even reached out to a coworker who was supposed to be traveling with him, trying to get some intel. Turns out, they hadn't been on any trip at all.

""Ms. Parks, I heard Mr. Herrera took a week off just to get ready for the wedding. I'd be thrilled to attend your wedding,"" the guy said.

""I'll see you then,"" I replied, chuckling weakly before hanging up.

I still found myself wondering if this whole thing was some sort of surprise that Austin was planning for me.

When I finally got home, the place was empty, and as I flipped the lights on, I realized there wasn't going to be any surprise waiting for me after all.

Feeling a bit let down, I collapsed on the couch and tried to clear my mind about what Austin was actually up to.

Just then, I got a message from Austin: \[The company had a temporary issue. We'd have to get the license some other time.\]

I replied with a simple \[Sure.\]

Then, out of curiosity, I opened Instagram and found a post from Austin's childhood sweetheart. \[Thanks for the birthday gift, Austin.\] It was accompanied by a photo of an island.

There was a girl in a cute swimsuit lounging under a coconut tree, donning a wide sun hat and carrying a limited edition bag. And in the reflections of her sunglasses was a solidly-built guy snapping a pic of her.

Yeah, that was definitely Austin off on a supposedly ""temporary"" commitment.

Scrolling through the comments, I saw others lamenting how they wished they had a brother like him.

I couldn't help but chuckle. Honestly, I felt pretty foolish. Just earlier, I was all worried about him, and now here I was, making excuses for his obvious lies.

I was so hopelessly dumb.

A dull ache settled in my chest. I'd been in love with Austin for six long years, and those sweet moments we shared were often tainted by things that didn't really belong to us.

There was his childhood sweetheart, Rosemary Read. Her parents had passed away when she was young, and she ended up being raised in Austin's home, which made them incredibly close, almost like siblings.

On my birthday, I'd find myself blowing out candles alone while he'd get wrapped up in some excuse related to Rosemary. He'd even bring her along on our dates, saying he couldn't leave her alone at home.

And when he finally proposed, he bought her a dress from the same collection he picked for me because, apparently, she liked it too.

All those memories flooded back, and every argument we had over Rosemary ended with that same phrase from him. ""She's just my little sister.""

My heart sank a little deeper, especially knowing he was off vacationing on some island with Rosemary while I sat at home waiting for him.

Six years. How many more of these could I take? Growing up without a father, I always wanted a complete family, dreaming that my future kids would have a happy home.

I smiled bitterly, wiping away the tears that had slipped out.

I even liked this post, hoping he'd take a hint. Then, I turned around and casually messaged a friend: \[Hey, can you set up that blind date you mentioned last time?\]

\*\*\*\*\*

Austin returned home three days later. He walked in with an icy chill hanging around him and stood in the foyer, waiting for me to come help with the bags.

I stayed put on the couch, not giving him a glance.

When I didn't move, he finally spoke up, ""Laurel, I'm home."" I just hummed and kept my eyes glued to the TV.

Noticing something was off, he hung his snow-drenched jacket by the door and made his way over to me. He wrapped me in his arms and softly asked if I was upset.

""Laurel, I'm sorry. That project was a bit tricky,"" he said.

I tuned into his steady heartbeat, which didn't skip a beat even when he lied.

""I saw Rosemary's Instagram,"" I shot back, locking my gaze on him to see how he'd react.

When I dropped Rosemary's name, I could see his face tighten with annoyance, and I could hear it in his voice. ""Rosemary just happened to be there, and I swung by for her birthday. How many times do I have to tell you I think of her like a little sister?""

Just like I thought, he was sticking to the same old script. ""Oh, so you had time for her birthday but no time to give me a call?"" I asked.

During the time I couldn't reach him, my mind raced, wondering if he was safe. I felt a lump in my throat as I fought to hold back tears in front of him.

Austin pressed his lips together and stubbornly added, ""What difference does it make? We still couldn't get a license anyway.""

I looked at him, the guy I'd spent six years with, and felt a wave of disappointment wash over me. For a moment, I didn't even want to argue.

Just then, the doorbell rang. I got up to answer it, and it was Rosemary. She had a big bag in her hand and smiled warmly at me. ""Laurel, you're here. I brought Austin's stuff he left at my place.""

She handed me the bag, revealing a bracelet around her wrist.

My heart dropped when I saw it, and I froze as I took the bag in my hands. That bracelet was special. Austin had traveled to several cities to get it for me.

When he gave it to me, he said, ""I hope this brings you luck.""

Turns out, what I thought was something unique between us, he had given to Rosemary too.

""Sorry, Laurel,"" Rosemary said, her hands together and her head tilted, her eyes wide with innocence.

# Chapter 2 Break Up

""You're not upset that Austin took me on vacation for my birthday, are you?"" Rosemary asked.

I looked at her, not saying a word, and quietly closed the door behind me.

\*\*\*\*\*

I went cold turkey with Austin. Every time we fought about Rosemary, it would spark a silent war. Austin had gotten used to this pattern, knowing that after three days, I'd be back in front of him, ready to make up.

I hadn't even drifted off to sleep when there was a loud knock at my door.

""Laurel!"" Austin shouted, his voice filled with frustration.

I opened the door, and he shoved his phone at me. ""How many times do I have to say it? Rosemary is just my sister! Why do you take it so personally?""

I was clueless. ""What did I do to her?""

""And you have the nerve to ask! Did you say something to her when she came over? Mom said she's been off since she got back, and now she's in the hospital because of her depression!""

I glanced at Austin's phone, the screen showing a picture of Rosemary lying weakly in a hospital bed, her wrist wrapped in thick gauze.

""I didn't say anything to her,"" I said. I was being honest.

Austin said to me sharply with one hand around my neck, ""If anything goes wrong with Rosemary, you can forget about marrying me.""

I wanted to call him a psycho, but I couldn't get half a sound out of my throat, and I frantically scratched at Austin's hand, desperate for him to let me go.

Just when I felt like I might pass out, he threw me to the ground and looked down at me, condescendingly saying, ""After everything we've been through, if you don't go after Rosemary again, I might actually think about marrying you.""

With that, he turned and stormed downstairs, snatching the keys from the table before slamming the door behind him.

I was left sitting on the floor, struggling to catch my breath. It felt like my heart was completely shattered. He made these wild accusations without a shred of proof, and it was like he was losing it over it all.

I wobbled a bit as I pushed myself up, steadying myself against the wall, and grabbed the phone that had been ringing off the hook on the nightstand.

""Laurel, it's been ages! Want to grab a drink?"" It was Erin George, my high school classmate, someone I hadn't seen in years.

She had just landed in Newton City and was only around for a day before she headed back.

Taking a deep breath to steady my nerves, I agreed to meet her.

\*\*\*\*\*

Erin had reserved a fancy dining room and invited a few of our close friends from the area. The vibe was chill as we all caught up, sharing stories from our lives while reminiscing about the good old times.

""So, Laurel, how are things with you and Austin? Still not married?"" Erin shot me a teasing look.

Back in the day, everyone figured Austin and I would end up together since we were high school sweethearts who went to the same college.

I tugged at the collar of my turtleneck sweater, avoiding eye contact as I swirled the wine in my glass before downing it. ""Nope. Guess it just wasn't meant to be.""

Polly Maxwell frowned, leaning in. ""Is it you or him who doesn't want it anymore?""

""It's him,"" I replied, feeling the weight of those words.

Suddenly, Polly slammed her hand on the table hard enough to send her fork clattering to the ground. ""Is it because of Rosemary? I warned you ages ago that she'd always be in the way between you two, but you wouldn't listen!""

I couldn't help but let out a bitter laugh and shake my head. I always thought Austin just liked pampering his ""sister.""

""Rosemary?"" Laura Watson chimed in, pulling out her phone to show us something.

She played a video that caught everyone's attention: there was Rosemary, wildly banging on a middle-aged guy with her heel. The man held her wrists firmly and was telling bystanders, ""My wife is just having a tantrum, so don't mind her.""

With tears in her eyes, Rosemary was begging, ""No, please help me!""

The video ended with a tall guy standing up to confront the burly man, announcing that the police were on their way. Just before he left, the burly guy leaned in to whisper something threatening to Rosemary.

""It went viral in my neighborhood‚Äîeveryone was saying the guy was a psychopath and warned to be careful when going out."" Laura looked at me, her eyes filled with pity. ""It looked like Rosemary.""

""It's her,"" I said calmly, unable to shake the unsettling feeling.

The woman in the video looked just like Rosemary, from her hair to the outfit she wore.

Austin had vaguely mentioned that Rosemary had been molested as a child, leaving her with deep psychological scars. I couldn't help but think the psycho had something to do with her suicide.

""Quit bringing her up. I told you Austin's no good for you. When the hell are you finally gonna dump him?"" Polly, a bit tipsy, shot me a disapproving look, like she was ready to jump on me if I said I still had feelings for Austin.

Outside, the rain drizzled against the window, and I noticed a dull ache from the bruise on my neck.

I stared at the raindrops sliding down the glass, feeling a bit lost. ""Just a couple more days.""

\*\*\*\*\*

A week later, Austin got in touch again. The whole Rosemary situation had somehow made the news, and I followed it reluctantly.

The report said the man was in a psychiatric hospital, and the girl who was involved was under close protection by her family.

I knew Austin was aware of the truth. When he called, instead of apologizing, he casually informed me he'd be home for dinner tonight. I shrugged it off, ""Anything else?""

The agent waited patiently for me to sign the contract, and I double-checked everything before putting my name down. Austin was quiet for a while, then finally said, ""Laurel, about the other day, I...""

I kept silent, waiting for him to continue. In the end, I didn't get the apology I expected. Instead, he blurted out, ""Let's get married, Laurel. I'll meet you at the city hall tomorrow.""

I couldn't help but smile ironically, feeling an unusual heaviness in my heart.

Had I been so indulgent with him over the years that I'd given him the impression this was how to make it up to me? Did he really think I was that easy to brush aside?

""No, thanks,"" I replied.

His displeasure was clear. ""What do you mean, no?""

I strolled over to the window to take in the view of Newton City, a place I'd been stuck in for what felt like ages. I moved here for Austin since his whole family was based in this city.

I saved up every penny to buy this house, hoping that one day, if I got married, my mom would come to live here with me. It'd make it easier to care for her.

But honestly, I couldn't shake the feeling that I was being pretty selfish, making her move to a strange city just for me. Right now, though, I'd never felt more sober.

""I mean, we're done,"" I said.

Austin was about to say more when I heard Rosemary's voice blaring on the other end. ""Austin, where are you?""

He left me a quick, irritated ""Cut it out"" and hung up.

The agent beside me pretended not to notice the commotion and flashed a smile, saying, ""Ms. Parks, the funds will arrive within 24 hours.""

I nodded and handed him the key. ""Thanks. Here you go.""

# Chapter 3 Choices

After selling the house, I drove back to the place I shared with Austin and opened the door to an eerie stillness.

It seemed Austin hadn't been around for a while‚Äîhe'd been busy taking care of Rosemary at the hospital.

I couldn't help but smirk a little. Honestly, that was fine by me. I'd rather not run into him.

Most of my stuff was in the second bedroom, and over the years, I'd had my fair share of arguments with Austin about Rosemary.

I had spent my time in that room during the rough patches and felt like I was constantly keeping my head down.

A bitter smile crept across my face as I packed up my things, remembering how submissive I used to be.

I didn't bother keeping anything that reminded me of Austin. Two hours later, I wiped the beads of sweat off my forehead with a tissue, feeling a mix of exhaustion and relief.

Then, my phone rang. I glanced at the caller ID and saw it was my mom. I hesitated for a second before answering. ""Hey, Mom.""

Her voice was filled with that familiar mix of excitement and nostalgia. ""Laurel, how's it going? Have you gotten the license yet? Have you and Austin talked about the wedding plans?""

I felt something tighten in my throat as I opened my mouth, but nothing came out.

There was a long, awkward silence, and when my mom began to press me, I took a deep breath, fighting back tears. ""Mom, I'm not getting married.""

""What do you mean, Laurel? What's going on?"" Her tone turned anxious.

I tried to explain, ""I just don't think Austin and I are right for each other.""

Her voice rose slightly. ""But Laurel, you've been together forever! Why say this now, right before the wedding? Come on, you're 27, not a kid anymore.""

It struck me that without even asking what I was feeling, she just urged me to get married.

Tears filled my eyes, and I had to cover my mouth to keep from breaking down. After what felt like forever, I found my voice, ""Mom, I really just don't want to marry him.""

My mom didn't hold back her frustration. ""So what do you want, then? Just give up on all these years?""

When she heard my firm answer, her tone shifted. ""Laurel, how can you just say you don't want this after all this time?""

""Well, I just said it,"" I shot back, feeling overwhelmed.

My mom's voice suddenly went all high-pitched, probably still trying to convince me, and before she could make a sound, I heard a dull thud from the other end of the line.

""Mom?"" I called out but got no response.

A wave of panic hit me like a freight train. ""Mom! What's wrong? Please answer me!""

All I could make out was a faint moan of pain coming from her. My heart clenched tight, and I hung up in a hurry, flipping on the home security feed.

In my panic, my phone slipped from my shaking hands, sliding under the couch like it was covered in grease.

I dropped to my knees, desperately reaching for my phone. The security footage showed my mom, clearly in distress, clutching her chest and reaching for her medicine on the table.

All I wanted to do was dive through the screen and hand her the pills she needed.

I had only one thought racing through my mind: save my mom. I quickly opened my contacts and dialed my aunt, Bonnie Porter, who lived in the same building with my mom.

""Come on, pick up!"" I pleaded, praying she'd answer fast.

The ten seconds felt like an eternity, but finally, Bonnie picked up. I burst into tears, sounding like a total mess as I exclaimed, ""Aunt Bonnie, my mom is having an attack! You need to hurry!""

Bonnie sounded surprised but jumped into action, heading over to my mom's place while trying to calm me down.

I hung up and immediately called for an ambulance, anxiously switching back to the feed, just hoping someone would get to my mom in time.

At that moment, I regretted everything about moving to Newton City alone and leaving my mom all by herself. Watching her suffer through a screen felt like a nightmare.

I couldn't help but blame myself for being so hasty in talking to her and pushing her buttons.

The self-loathing and regret were overwhelming. I shouldn't have done that. I was so wrong. I promised myself, never again.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity of two minutes, I heard the doorbell chime, signaling that Bonnie had entered the house.

She rushed in, looking almost like an angel descending from above, and quickly administered the medicine from the table to my mom.

Through the monitor, I watched as my mom's pale expression started to ease up while my phone slipped weakly to the floor.

Bonnie called me to let me know that my mom was out of danger, and I insisted she take her to the hospital for a follow-up.

It wasn't until I hung up that I felt like I'd regained my sanity, and my heart, which was racing like crazy, finally calmed down.

Taking a deep breath, I picked up the pace with my packing. The thought of leaving Newton City was getting harder to shake off.

The moving guys were still on their way, so I was waiting and checking in with Bonnie about my mom's condition when, out of nowhere, Austin appeared right in front of me.

The sound of the bouquet hitting the floor snapped me out of my phone trance, and I was taken aback by his sudden presence.

He was all dressed up in a sharp suit and tie, with his hair styled just right, showing off a smooth forehead that gave him a touch of mature charm. A bunch of delicate roses lay discarded at his feet.

His eyes looked stormy, filled with suppressed anger as he gritted out, ""Laurel, what do you mean by that?""

""Didn't I tell you? I want to break up. Do you not get it?"" My emotions were all over the place, and I was starting to lose my patience, saying whatever popped into my head.

He kicked the coffee table in frustration, sending glass flying, and pointed at the photo I had tossed in the trash, shouting angrily, ""I'm going to get a marriage license with you today. What do you mean?""

So that was why he dressed up‚Äîhe thought we were heading to get a license. I assumed he dressed to the nine to pick up Rosemary from the hospital.

""I don't need that‚Äî"" I tried to shoot back.

Before I could finish, he cut me off, ""Didn't I promise to marry you? What do you want? Are you done with your little tantrum? If you don't marry me, what are you going to say to your mom?""

Looking at his smug face, I couldn't help but think he knew how much my mom had been looking forward to my wedding for ages.

So he knew all the time. He kept me waiting for three long years before finally agreeing to marry me, fully aware of my mom's situation.

It was just heartbreaking. What was I even doing falling for him?

I found myself staring at Austin in silence, my eyes reflecting a deep emptiness.

His anger started to fade as he seemed to regain some composure, and he began to softly coax me, ""I was wrong to stand you up, Laurel. Can we move past this?""

My resolve started to waver, but not because of him‚Äîit was all about my mom. I really worried that she would get so upset over everything that it would send her into another health scare.

She'd been adamant about me starting a family, and she'd definitely prefer Austin, the guy I've been in love with for years, over some blind date she barely knew.

That bruise on my neck was a constant reminder that I shouldn't just give in. But my mom was still stuck in that hospital bed, and it stopped me cold.

Just as I was about to crack, something unexpected happened that helped me decide what to do.

# Chapter 4 Just A Bad Dream

At that moment, a figure suddenly appeared, and I was taken aback to see Rosemary standing right in front of me.

She looked drained and pale, wearing a white dress that did nothing to hide her distress.

""Laurel, are you mad at Austin?"" Rosemary's eyes were glossy with unshed tears, and there was a mix of fear and helplessness in her expression.

She continued, her voice cracking, ""It's all my fault. I didn't clarify things with Austin, and that's what led to the misunderstanding between you two.""

I remained silent, my gaze fixed on Rosemary.

""Please, don't be angry with him. I'm truly sorry,"" she pleaded, clearly overwhelmed. ""Austin has been planning for ages to get a marriage license with you."" She bit her lip, looking extremely weak.

I was about to reply when Austin, whose face was dark with frustration, said, ""Laurel, enough already. Rosemary came here to apologize‚Äîwhat more do you want from her?""

I noticed the bruise on her wrist, wrapped in cloth, and shifted my attention to Austin, ""Austin, how about you make a choice? You can either have me or Rosemary.""

""That's enough, Laurel!"" he snapped, glaring at me as though he could burn a hole right through me.

The answer had been clear for a while, but here I was, still holding on. Not for him, but for myself. Six years. How did I lose myself in all this and end up loving a guy like him? I had no idea.

I looked at Austin, trying to keep my cool, and gave a faint smile. ""So, if I go celebrate another guy's birthday, hang around when he's sick, and baby him every now and then, does that make me just some shameless woman in your eyes?""

""Laurel, Austin and I are not what you think,"" Rosemary mumbled, her surprise evident.

""Come on, Rosemary. You know Austin and I are getting married, so why do you keep showing up looking all innocent? You're playing the role of the 'good girl' pretty well,"" I shot back.

With those words, Rosemary froze, disbelief written all over her face, and then she burst into tears.

Pop! Austin's brow furrowed in anger as he stared at me, who had been slapped to the ground by him.

""Laurel,"" Rosemary's reaction was immediate as she rushed to help me.

But I caught a glimpse of a smirk creeping onto her lips just before she lowered her gaze. It was quick but telling.

""Fuck off!"" The words flew out before I could stop myself, and Rosemary stumbled back a couple of steps.

""Laurel,"" Austin said, his eyes heavy with disappointment. ""You've turned into a green-eyed monster. Rosemary was just trying to help you, and you went and pushed her away?""

Rosemary started tugging on his arm, stammering, ""Austin, I'm fine. It's my fault. I made Laurel mad.""

I finally managed to stand and let out a soft laugh. ""What a twist! Did I even touch you, Rosemary? No matter what happens, suddenly it's my fault? Am I like some kind of biochemical weapon just for you?""

Rosemary looked stunned, lost for words, but then tears started streaming down her face as if they were on a mission.

""Laurel, I want you to apologize to Rosemary! Or else I'm not getting married,"" Austin demanded, furrowing his brow. He seemed totally unfazed by the breakup talk.

Sure, I usually brought up breakups during our fights, but in the end, all it took was a little coaxing from him, and I'd be back on his side, pretending nothing had ever gone wrong.

I didn't want to dwell on these arguments to protect our feelings.

But suddenly it hit me: what Austin and I had was just me fooling myself, constantly backing down and giving in.

""Austin, we're done. I'm the one who called it off. You both handle it from here,"" I said, wanting nothing more than to walk away from the mess and that scum for good.

With that, I grabbed my suitcase and headed for the door, not looking back. Rosemary was still trying to reason with Austin. ""Austin, you should go after Laurel. This is all my fault,"" she pleaded.

""Relax, she's just having a little meltdown. She won't really break up with me,"" Austin assured her.

Once I settled into the cab, I noticed the two of them on the security camera, wrapped up in each other's arms, and I couldn't help but smirk a little. They claimed there was nothing between them, but deep down, I knew the truth.

I raised a hand to my cheek, still tender from Austin's earlier blow, and it felt like a knife twisted in my heart. The ache spread through my body, a reminder of the six years I'd wasted.

I wasn't crying, but my heart felt so heavy it was hard to breathe.

After a moment of reflection, I pulled up the video I had just recorded and posted it on my Instagram.

Since I decided to cut ties with Austin, I figured it was only fitting to finish what they started. I wasn't going to take this slap for nothing.

I crafted my last message: \[A shoutout to those who'd supported me over the past six years. I am officially breaking up with Austin.\]

With a final click, I powered off my phone. Clutching an ice pack over my throbbing head, I glanced at the city disappearing beneath me.

There was a mix of humiliation and anger in my heart, but seeing the bright blue sky somehow lightened the burden a bit.

Before I knew it, I drifted off to sleep, only to wake up with tears streaming down my face. Just then, a long, elegant hand offered me a gray handkerchief.

""Here,"" the owner of the pretty hand said, his voice smooth and calming.

""Thanks,"" I mumbled, taking it awkwardly.

""Are you alright?"" he asked, a note of concern in his tone.

I nodded, forcing a bittersweet smile. ""I'm fine, just a bad dream.""

I dreamt back to the first time I laid eyes on Austin, my heart racing‚Äîit was definitely one of those love-at-first-sight moments.

Later on, I even went so far as to lower my standards just to get into the same school as him. I thought it would lead to a better life, but honestly, I was just squandering my best years.

It was interesting how sometimes the wrong person could feel scarier than facing a real demon.

I let out a deep sigh and turned to glance at the guy sitting next to me. Just one look, and my whole body froze.

My heart raced as I managed to stammer, ""Un-uncle Alex, what are you doing here?""

Alex Herrera raised an eyebrow, sizing me up before casually saying, ""Didn't you break up with Austin? Why do you still call me uncle?""

# Chapter 5 An Awkward Encounter

I took a deep breath when I unexpectedly ran into Alex on the plane. How did I end up meeting him here? He was Austin's uncle and Raphael Herrera's youngest son.

In the Herrera family, he was the one everyone feared‚Äîespecially Austin.

Growing up, Alex was molded to be someone else entirely. When I first heard his name, I pictured a woman, but instead, I found this incredibly handsome guy‚Äîmore stunning than most women I know.

Not only did he have looks, but he had also got this air of sophistication about him. At a young age, he was already seated as the president of Herrera Group.

Though he was only six years older than Austin, Austin had to call him uncle, and I was dating Austin, so I'd been doing the same.

But now that Austin and I were officially done, it felt silly to still call him that.

""Did you and Austin have a fallout?"" Alex asked, his voice lowered as he crossed his legs, a knowing smile on his face.

""No, it's a breakup,"" I said, trying to sound confident.

""A breakup?"" He looked surprised, still smiling, but I could tell he didn't buy it.

I mean, who could blame him? Being married to Austin, a rich young man from the Herrera family, seemed like a dream for most women.

Besides, after six years together, how could I possibly just walk away from that? Back then, I was all-in on Austin.

Everyone thought I was just lucky to be with him, and honestly, if he'd revealed his true identity back in school, I might not have been his pick in the first place.

Now, I was nearing thirty with nothing to show for it‚Äîwho was I to break up with him? Even Austin assumed I was head over heels for him and that suggesting a breakup was just me throwing a fit.

""Yeah,"" I said, taking a deep breath to steady myself, trying my best to keep it cool.

""I saw your Instagram."" Alex looked up slowly, his voice still calm and soft.

It felt like the way an elder talked to a younger person, but the light in his eyes‚Äîslightly reminiscent of Austin's‚Äîhit me with a mix of panic and awe.

I honestly hadn't expected Alex to keep tabs on my Instagram, and I'd even forgotten he had an account. He rarely said much online, just a few holiday photos now and then. I seriously wondered if he even used it himself.

""As long as you've thought it through,"" he added.

I was taken aback for a second, waiting for Alex to drop some words of shame or caution about being impulsive. Instead, he surprised me with his response.

The tension in my chest vanished instantly as I managed a shy smile and nodded silently.

I didn't breathe a sigh of relief until the plane touched down and I watched Alex stand up and grab his luggage.

Although he wasn't as intimidating as I had imagined, he still had this unshakeable aura that felt heavy.

As I stepped out of the airport, a black Alphard suddenly pulled up right in front of me.

Before I could process it, the driver came over and said, ""Ms. Parks, Mr. Herrera asked me to give you a ride.""

I opened my mouth to decline, but when the window rolled down and I saw that gorgeous face, words just vanished.

At that moment, it hit me‚ÄîAustin's fear of Alex was totally justified. The guy had such a strong presence that I felt too timid to say no.

""Get in the car. It's going to rain soon,"" Alex said, glancing at me with that cool gaze.

I found myself sliding into the car without a second thought. Sitting beside him, I quickly masked my emotions. My face was calm, but inside, I felt this strange unease.

After all, I had just broken up with Austin. Why would Alex bother giving me a ride? Was it just because of the rain? Or maybe he felt sorry for me?

Trying to figure it out was a lost cause, especially since Alex and I had only crossed paths a few times.

It was not like a guy like him would focus on someone like me. Maybe it was just pity, some kindness for someone who had just got out of a serious relationship. Honestly, I decided not to overthink it.

""Where to?"" Alex's calm voice pulled me out of my thoughts.

""The hospital,"" I replied almost automatically, without thinking twice.

Honestly, I felt a bit awkward saying that, but I was already thankful that I kept my home address under wraps.

All of a sudden, it started pouring rain. It didn't even register with me that it was actually raining.

Half an hour later, we pulled up outside the hospital. The driver got out, grabbed my luggage from the trunk, and strolled over with an umbrella in hand.

As I stepped out, I glanced back at Alex, who was sitting in the car with his eyes half-closed. I swallowed my thanks and left.

Taking my suitcase and turning my back to the sleek black car, I finally let out a long sigh of relief.

In my mind, I couldn't shake the image of Alex's striking profile. He was clearly in his early thirties but carried an air of maturity that made him seem older.

It was a shame, too, because, with a face like that, Alex would probably attract a lot of young admirers.

As I walked into the hospital and fished out my phone, a call came in from an unknown number. After a brief moment of hesitation, I hit the answer button.

""Laurel, what the heck is wrong with you? Do you even realize that Rosemary is sick because of you?"" It was Amanda Herrera, Austin's mother, and her angry voice echoed through the line.

I stood there for a second, stunned, gripping my suitcase tightly.

""Laurel, you need to come back right now and apologize to Rosemary. Clear things up online and say you posted that video by accident. We'll let this slide!"" Amanda demanded.

I instinctively ran my fingers over my throat, which still felt a bit sore.

I was relieved that I hadn't gone through with getting a license with Austin.

Honestly, I was grateful for the last three years of not marrying him. It took me a while to truly see how ridiculous I was being.

Looking back on the past six years, it felt like I'd thrown a piece of my heart to the wolves.

I looked at her and said, ""Mrs. Herrera, Austin and I are through. So, do me a favor and don't bother me again.""

""Laurel, enough already! You're really crossing the line here. My mom called you‚Äîso what the hell do you want from me?"" Austin's voice came through, sharp and frustrated.",1,1750665933.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1liatlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/HPfanfiction/comments/1liatlx/promo_dinner_with_the_dursley/,[Promo] Dinner with the Dursley,"A different take on Aunt Marge and Harry's interaction

Harry Potter did his best to remain out of sight while the Dursleys were finishing their dinner. He quietly went over his studies as his relatives continued to feast and drink merrily. While there was great animosity between them and Harry, the truth was they were suspicious of him and his new abilities. Uncle Vernon's sister, Aunt Marge, had come to stay for a week as she resided in a large house in the country side. A wealthy women, she spend most of her working life breeding pedigree bulldogs and taking vacations to exotic countries in the far east. 

""Usually it's just a fry-up for me what with twelve dogs to look after,"" Aunt Marge continued, pouring herself another brandy. ""It's certainly been stressful these last few weeks, we're currently at the peak of the Estrus period and the mess is extraordinary. But I think Dr. Harvey-Grigg's latest book aptly summarizes the relationship between the homozygous expression of deleterious recessive mutations and the increase in the inbreeding coefficient."" The others all nodded in agreement. ""I certainly hope that later on when the dogs are going through diestrus that none of them will show signs of pseudopregnancy though. But that won't be a problem for Ripper here now will it?"" Aunt Marge laughed, Uncle Vernon chortled as he too took a sip of brandy. Even Petunia couldn't hide a faint smile. ""Anyway,"" Marge continued, ""Harry Potter's father was a drunk and unemployed wastrel,"" she took another sip of her brandy and wiped her mustache, turning over to Vernon she said ""and his mother was a bitch."" The others all nodded in agreement. 

""And she got herself killed in a drunk driving accident"". Aunt Marge added, the others began to giggle. 

""And she stank!"" The room erupted with laughter. ""because she pooed her pants heaps!"" The others howled and roared with laughter, drowning out the sounds of the TV Dudley was watching.

Harry Potter, having overheard the conversation, became enraged. He burst into the dining room with his wand, pointing it at Aunt Marge. ""*No one* talks about my parents that way"". Aunt Marge's glass shattered in her hand to reveal the end of her finger having swollen to the size of salami. ""My father was not a drunk and unemployed wastrel. Your assertions regarding my parents are, if you will pardon my bluntness, utterly preposterous. In fact, my father was a great and powerful wizard named 'James Potter'. My mother, Lily Evans, was also a powerful witch. I take great pride in my parents and am dismayed, nay, *pertubed* to hear you disrespect them as such. Why, I would have you as blow for that, yea. So,"" announced Harry, drawing himself up to his full height, ""as punishment: using the power of my magic wand, I hereby declare for you to be blow.""

Aunt Marge started blowing as the rest of her fingers blowed. Dudley, who had earlier sneaked off to the living room to watch TV, was eating chips on the couch oblivious to all this. One of Aunt Marge's buttons popped off her tweed jacket, flew into the next room and hit Dudley right in the head, causing him to fall off the couch. Both Vernon and Petunia were paralysed with surprise at what was happening to Aunt Marge, and Harry Potter just continued to look on with satisfaction. Aunt Marge kept on blowing and another button pinged off, hitting Dudley again for a second time.

Before long, Aunt Marge was completely blow and had lifted up from the table.

*BOING* AH! *BOING* AH! *BOING* AH!

Aunt Marge was bouncing on the ceiling, slowly making her way to the door. ""AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!"" She flew outside. Vernon ran after her and grabbed her foot, but he was lifted off the ground as well. ""Don't you dare let go!!!!!"" Yelled Aunt Marge, but Vernon had already dropped to the ground. ""NOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!""

Harry Potter calmly packed his suitcase and left the house with Vernon still yelling and Petunia still waving to Aunt Marge in the backyard. As Harry Potter walked along Privet Drive, a little black dot could be seen floating around in the sky...

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Later on, Harry Potter meets up with Ron and Hermione to discuss magic*
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

""And then I blowed her fat with a spell,"" said Harry.

""Wow, that's really cool!"" Laughed Ron. ""What happened next?""

""She flew away.""

""Serves her right. I hope she died,"" grumbled Hermione as she took a sip of her goblin coffee. ""I can't imagine how awful that must have been for you Harry, having to listen to somebody say such horrible things about your parents. I too feel heartbroken.""

""That's quite alright, Hermione. I'm getting better. I won't deny that I'm still really bothered by what I overheard, but it's nothing time can't heal,"" said Harry.

""Oh Harry Potter, you really are the best wizard ever!"" Ron praised. 

""I know,"" said Harry modestly. 

Something caught the corner of Hermione's eye as she peered over to a table at the other side of the room. ""Is that Dudley?""

""Yes it is,"" said Harry. ""Let's go be mean to him."" 

Ron and Hermione grinned in unison. ""Yeah!""

The trio got up, walked across the room and sat on either side of Dudley. ""Hi *Dudders*,"" mocked Harry. ""How's your head?""

""Still bruised a bit,"" replied Dudley.

""We saw your grandma pop,"" announced Ron.

Dudley looked up. ""Oh, ok.""

If you're planning a trip to Argentina, bring cash, preferably USD or euros. The situation there right now with the ATMs is awful, they'll only let you pull out small amounts at a time and they'll charge something like $10-15 USD for a transaction.  It's probably possible to get a better conversion with cash but even the guys offering to exchange on the street pretty much stick to the market rate, which seems to have been artificially set. It's wildly expensive there right now, (coffee, fruit, general stuff at the supermarkets, meals in restaurants) I wish I had visited during the days when it was cheaper but it seems those times are gone. Red wine still seems to have low prices however as it's in abundance there. 

I left Buenos Aires with their pesos and the rate offered for exchange in Uruguay was terrible everywhere, they simply don't want to hold it. So you don't want to leave Argentina holding their money. 

In Uruguay there's no economic issues there, it's always expensive. So everything besides accommodation just costs a lot. Pretty much the same as the USA or even Europe for food. There's some nice places along the coast to check out there however, I would certainly like to go back. This time of year is low season so the hostels/air bnbs are pretty cheap. If you pay for everything there on card it's better, as once the transaction is done with a foreign card some of the tax is removed and it automatically knocks the original price down on purchases.

I honestly don't know how people living in these countries get by though, so far as I can tell the average person is on around 1000 USD a month. Having said that I only saw a few homeless people in both countries. ",2,1750665170.0,solotravel,8,1.0,False

# Chapter 1 My Wife Has Violent Tendencies

As the heavy door of Ashwood Mental Hospital creaked open, a pale, slender woman stepped out. She was Audrey Patel. She covered her aching stomach and dragged her feet to walk, while the murmurs behind her followed like shadows.

Someone whispered, ""Mr. Patel's such a saint. He still sticks with her after she went nuts and hurt others with a knife.""

Another person said bitterly, ""If my wife pulled a stunt like that, I'd kick her out the same day. She's a total disgrace to Mr. Patel.""

Someone else chimed in, ""If Ms. Patterson's father hadn't passed away, and she hadn't moved in with her uncle, she would've married Mr. Patel ages ago. Audrey would never have had the chance.""

Audrey squinted against the harsh light and gave a bitter little smile.

Everyone knew the story. She was an orphan girl from some no-name town who somehow married Clayton Patel, a big-shot lawyer with a spotless image. People all said she won the lottery.

But now, with a reputation for being violent and unstable, fired from her job and fresh out of a mental hospital, she looked even more out of place next to Clayton.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'They all think I don't deserve him. Funny thing is, the one who stuck me in that hellhole and slapped that label on me was my perfect husband himself.'

It was July. The sun blazed down, but Audrey felt chilly all over, especially her heart.

Ashwood had a glossy cover story‚Äîsomething about correcting troubled youth and improving their mental state. But what went on inside was a nightmare.

Audrey, a 23-year-old grown woman, had been locked in there for a month because her husband claimed she was a danger and needed to have her mind straightened out.

During the past month, she was punished, starved, locked in pitch-black isolation‚Äîuntil she cracked, until she agreed she was wrong and promised to change.

Now, standing outside, breathing free air again, she watched Clayton hang up a call. His handsome face twisted with irritation.

""Zoe's ran a bath for you. Let's go home and wash off the bad luck,"" Clayton said to Audrey.

Audrey dodged the hand he reached toward her shoulder.

Clayton was always well-groomed with tailored suits and expensive cologne. But today, he didn't smell like his usual scent. Instead, he reeked of something sickly sweet, like overripe fruit. That scent made Audrey sick.

Ignoring Clayton's grim face, Audrey pulled open the passenger-side door and got in.

The driver, who'd already opened the back door, glanced at Clayton in confusion.

Clayton watched her, his lips pressed tight. He thought she was clearly still sulking after a month of confinement. He figured she wasn't used to that kind of strict environment, so she threw a tantrum.

Though he had his reasons, he still went too far to send her in against her will. So, for now, he didn't blame her for her little temper.

He sat in the back seat. The driver closed the door and started the car.

Audrey turned to the window and closed her eyes. The whole thing a month ago appeared in her mind.

It was her birthday that day. Clayton brought home a special guest‚Äîhis childhood friend, Valerie Patterson, and her three-year-old daughter, Luna Patterson.

While Clayton went to get the cake, Valerie grabbed a fruit knife and pressed it to her wrist, threatening to hurt herself if Audrey didn't give Clayton back to her.

Tears streamed down Valerie's face as she said she and Clayton were meant to be, that she came back to fix what they once lost.

Audrey lunged to stop Valerie and tried to snatch the knife just as Clayton walked in.

Valerie stumbled into Clayton's arms, sobbing like she'd just survived a war. ""Audrey, please don't hurt Luna. Clayton and I haven't done anything. You're getting it all wrong.""

Audrey stood frozen with the knife still in hand, her mind blanking out.

Valerie, still clinging to Clayton, glanced up at Audrey with a smug glint in her eyes. ""Clayton only let us move into your house 'cause we had nowhere else to go.

""I swear I'll pay back every penny he lent to us. Just don't scare my baby, okay? She's got autism.""

Clayton wrapped his arms around Valerie and Luna and shot a cold stare at Audrey. ""Valerie's hands are for painting. How could you hurt her?""

Little Luna, who watched the whole thing, just curled up tighter in Clayton's arms, shaking like a leaf.

Audrey let out a dry laugh, more from rage than amusement.

She thought to herself, 'So that's her game. She used my birthday party to air out her affair with Clayton. Either I suck it up and pretend my husband's got no side piece, or I pack my bags and quit the game.'

Audrey turned to Clayton, her voice firm. ""Believe it or not, she cut herself.""

""No way,"" Clayton shot back without missing a beat.

He was convinced no one knew Valerie's talent with a paintbrush better than he did. She would rather die than damage her hands. No chance she'd hurt herself just to frame Audrey.

Audrey scoffed and pointed straight at Valerie. ""Then tell me, why did you let them live in the house I bought and even gave them money? You're keeping her and her kid on the side, and I'm supposed to just be cool with it?""

Clayton's colleagues and a couple of his friends were right behind him. Being embarrassed like that in front of everyone clearly rattled him.

""My hand... Clayton, it hurts,"" Valerie whimpered, holding out her bleeding wrist, swaying like she was about to faint.

Guilt flashed across Clayton's face, but it was gone in a blink, replaced by anger. He barked at his assistant, ""My wife has violent tendencies. Send her to Ashwood Mental Hospital.""

Thinking back on it, Audrey put on a cold smile, sneering, 'To protect that woman's reputation, my husband threw me into that filthy place.'

Clayton must've caught that mocking look on her face, because for once, he tried to explain himself, ""I sent you to Ashwood to keep things from getting worse. You scared Luna.

""She had a fever for days. They've had a hard time. You shouldn't trash Valerie like that.""

Audrey opened her eyes, her gaze turning icy. ""I picked the house. I pay the mortgage. They're living in it and spending money from MY husband. Yeah, clearly I screwed up. I should've been more generous, huh?""

Clayton took a deep breath and said, ""Vally doesn't blame you. She's already dropped the charges. It won't affect you.""

Audrey sneered, thinking, 'Won't affect me? Due to my so-called violent tendencies you pinned on me, I lost my job three days after staying at Ashwood.'

Clayton and Valerie went way back. Years ago, both Valerie and Clayton's fathers got sick. Valerie's father gave up his shot at treatment and donated his kidney to save Clayton's father.

After that, Valerie and her mother moved out of town to live with her uncle. The night she turned up again, she was on the run. She was beaten by her husband, so she took her daughter to leave.

Clayton just happened to be on a business trip in that exact city. He swooped in like a hero, took on Valerie's divorce case, and brought her and her daughter back to Ironhaven.

\*\*\*\*\*

The car slowly rolled into Hightower Homes. Audrey didn't wait for it to stop but opened the door, got out, and headed straight for the elevator without a glance back.

She took a long shower and changed into clean clothes.

When she came out, Zoe was carrying dishes from the kitchen. She said with a smile, ""Dinner's almost ready, ma'am. Mr. Patel picked all your favorites.""

Clayton was on the couch going through some documents. He looked up over the rim of his gold-rimmed glasses and said, ""Dry your hair first. I'll wait to eat with you.""

Anyone walking in might've thought he was the picture of a devoted husband, setting aside legal briefs to dine with his wife.

But Audrey knew this was just his usual trick: slap you across the face and then hand you a candy.

Clayton took off his glasses and walked to the dining table. Pulling out a chair, he said, ""It's a bit late today. I'll have Zoe buy your favorite fish tomorrow.""

Audrey sat down without a word and picked up her fork.

Clayton was good at keeping his emotions locked up and hardly ever spoke more than necessary. Most of the time when they were together, Audrey always babbled him with some online gossip just to fill the silence.

Each time, Audrey would laugh out loud, yet Clayton was just calm and would sometimes give her a look to remind her of being composed.

Now, Audrey didn't even look at him. Worse, when he tried to serve her some food, she just picked it up and tossed it back onto the plate.

# Chapter 2 Don't Keep Pushing

Clayton tried to serve her more food, but Audrey stood up, dumped her utensils in the sink, and walked straight to the bedroom.

They had a nanny at home, but Audrey liked doing things herself. She used to cook Clayton's favorite meals and laid out his suits for the day. Zoe came in for an hour daily just to tidy up.

She used to think it was a sweet little routine between them, yet now, recalling what happened, Audrey felt like she was out of her mind in the past.

Clayton's mother, Lillian Patel, always thought Audrey was after Clayton's money. She made Clayton hand over half his paycheck every month for her to keep and said she'd return it when she was sure Audrey wasn't a gold digger.

Their finances had basically been split fifty-fifty since the wedding. And outsiders still loved gossiping about how Audrey married up, about her being some clingy, fame-hungry wannabe.

Audrey put up with all of it because she loved Clayton. But now? Now she couldn't believe how blind she used to be.

The husband she always felt proud of, the man who once stood for justice, fighting tooth and nail for unpaid factory workers, now threw his own wife under the bus to protect another woman's reputation.

Clayton's hand froze in the air, and he clearly felt the weight of her cold shoulder. He wiped his mouth with a napkin and knocked gently on the bedroom door. ""Audrey, I can explain that thing.""

From inside, Audrey let out a bitter laugh and thought, 'If you had anything to say, why didn't you say it a month ago in front of your coworkers, your friends, and in front of her? What's the act for now?'

She remembered that look in his eyes that night was nothing but irritation, and he said to her, ""You can leave Ashwood once you calm down.""

He even said, ""Vally and Luna have had it rough. If you're gonna make things worse for them, then maybe it's time you felt what being truly alone is like.""

He knew she was an orphan, and he always knew he was her only lifeline. But instead of standing by her, he sided with Valerie and crushed what little hope she had left.

When Valerie watched Audrey being dragged into Ashwood, she didn't even try to hide the satisfaction in her eyes. She smiled, as if saying, 'Say what you want, Clayton won't believe you. The more you fight it, the crazier you'll look.'

Audrey tried to break free from the nurses and scrambled back toward the hallway. With just one door between them, she heard Valerie sweet-talking Clayton, ""Clay, the doctor just said I can't draw anymore, but I can still have other jobs. Audrey only hurt me 'cause she loves you too much.""

Audrey didn't hear what Clayton replied because she was already forced into a room with bars on the windows.

She'd clenched her teeth and thought, 'If Clayton wants to play savior, he better chain himself to her for life. Just don't drag decent people down with them. I'm not interested in his lame excuse.'

Clearly thrown by Audrey's sudden silence, Clayton loosened his tie, feeling irritated without knowing why. He raised his voice to say, ""Why do you hate Vally so much? She's just a friend.""

Audrey didn't buy that for a second. She couldn't believe he still pretended not to know how Valerie felt for him.

After all, Valerie was jobless, divorced, and took her three-year-old daughter with autism back to Ironhaven and stepped into their life.

Audrey sneered inwardly, 'What kind of friend pushes others to divorce? What kind of friend throws herself into the arms of another woman's husband?'

If things kept going like this, Audrey knew she'd finally go crazy one day.

She suddenly flung the bedroom door open and sneered, ""Your family owes Valerie. That's your business, not mine. You want me to take care of your parents, but now I'm supposed to repay your debt too?""

She thought bitterly, 'Just because I married a superior and famous lawyer, I should play the good wife role? I didn't get any benefit from this marriage but got hurt mentally and physically.'

She looked him straight in the eye and said firmly, ""You were scared people would talk trash about her, so you told them I was violent and unstable. Her father saved your father, so you wanna sacrifice my reputation to protect her name?""

Her voice shook with rage. ""What right does she have to live in the house I bought and spend the money my husband gives her? What right do you have to send me to that darned mental hospital?""

Audrey had been holding her rage all in for too long, and now the dam burst. She let all her rage and her heartbreak out.

She hated Valerie for twisting the truth, but even more than that, she hated the man who once promised her a warm and safe home. She took a shaky breath, wiped her face, and realized her cheeks were wet with tears.

Clayton's expression turned more serious. He hadn't expected her to be this furious. Lowering his voice, he said, ""I know you lost your job, but I'll support you. Once Vally and Luna settle down, I'll hand over the rest of my paycheck to you.""

Audrey let out a long breath, feeling tired. She thought to herself, 'If I fall for his crap again, I'm the dumbest woman ever. You betrayed me once, and what makes you think I'll believe your promise again?'

She'd seen through him completely. Clayton's heart had already gone rotten. He'd always side with Valerie. This time, she was sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital. But she didn't know if she had a fight with Valerie again, what her heartless husband would do to her.

After all, she had no family. Clayton, as her legal guardian, had the power to do whatever he wanted.

Audrey looked at Clayton. Her eyes contained no more softness, no love, just a sheet of coldness.

She said, ""Don't bother dangling carrots in front of me. I got fired due to Valerie. You're gonna pay me 150,000 dollars. Then we get a divorce. You can play house with whoever you want after that.""

""I'm not divorcing you,"" Clayton shot back without hesitation.

Yanking off his tie, he flung it onto the couch. His chest felt tight, like he couldn't breathe. He thought, 'She wants a divorce over something so small? What the hell is wrong with her?'

The tie hit a decorative piece on the coffee table, knocking it to the floor. It shattered with a sharp crash, broken into pieces.

For once, the always-composed lawyer Clayton raised his voice. ""You lost your job, and I'll make it right. But divorce? Out of the question.""

He thought he'd already lowered himself enough. He was Clayton‚Äîthe admired, respected, and untouchable top-tier lawyer. Now that he was trying to meet her halfway, Audrey should've known when to quit.

But Audrey's eyes were colder than ever. There was even disgust in them.

Clayton suddenly felt something slipping out of his grasp. He couldn't name it, but the feeling irritated him more than he cared to admit.

He muttered, ""It's all in the past. Can't we let it go?""

""Clay? Is Audrey back?"" Valerie's voice rang out as she walked in, decked out in a Chanel dress, a Coach bag on her arm, and a pair of shining high heels.

Valerie was five years older than Audrey, but she dressed younger and more fashionably. Audrey had always been practical‚Äîsaving every cent to pay off the mortgage early, never splurging on luxury brands.

However, Valerie, a jobless single mother with a sick toddler, strolled in head-to-toe brands. It didn't take a genius to figure out who was footing the bill.

She stopped at the entryway, pretending to be shocked at the pieces on the floor. ""Audrey, if you've got a problem, take it out on me. My hand's ruined already. Go ahead and slash me again if it makes you feel better.

""That piece is a foreign art exhibit, you know? Clayton really likes it. It cost a few grand.""

Audrey let out a laugh that was anything but amused. ""Valerie, with that kind of imagination, you seriously missed your calling. You should be stalking celebs for gossip sites. I bought that piece, okay? How this involves you?""

Before Valerie could get a word in, Audrey turned to Clayton. ""You heard her, right? That thing's a foreign exhibit, cost 6,000 dollars. You broke it. You gotta pay.""

Valerie's eyes filled with tears instantly. She turned those helpless, wounded eyes toward Clayton. ""Clay, I thought you guys were arguing about me, so I‚Äî""

Clayton clenched his fists, feeling fed up. ""Vally's already forgiven you for what you did to her. You don't need to keep pushing.""

# Chapter 3 Clear The Mess

Valerie gently touched Clayton's arm and said, ""Clay, it's fine. I know Audrey hates me. I'll just leave now.""

But she didn't move a muscle. Instead, she looked up at Clayton with wide eyes, full of dependence and reluctance.

Clayton picked up the broken pieces and placed them on the coffee table. He was afraid Audrey might lose it again and end up hurting Valerie.

Clayton and Audrey got married just after they met each other. Back then, he was pissed at his family and randomly asked Audrey, who'd just dropped off a file at his law firm, if she'd marry him.

Audrey's reaction was unforgettable. She was first shocked, then pure joy. She told him she was an orphan, just landed a job at a foreign company, and didn't have much to offer compared to him. She promised she'd work hard, catch up to him, and be worthy.

Clayton made sure to sign a prenup, and the two of them got their marriage license without much fuss.

In the year since, Audrey worked her ass off at the office and at home. She arranged everything well, made his favorite meals, and never once complained.

Clayton could see how much she loved him in her eyes. He enjoyed being the center of her world. He believed she'd never actually leave him, and everything she said was just because she was angry.

Clayton said to Valerie, ""Vally, can you go back for now?""

""Huh?"" Valerie looked like she'd just been slapped.

Her eyes went wide in disbelief, and she thought, 'Is Clayton seriously kicking me out for Audrey?'

""I need to talk to Audrey. I'll come see you later,"" he added, looking at her with a gentler gaze, like trying to soothe a sulking child.

""Alright, I'll wait for you,"" Valerie said, but her heels didn't budge.

She turned to Audrey with a smile that barely masked her bitterness. ""Audrey, Clayton and I have known each other since we were kids. If anything were going to happen between us, it would've happened a long time ago. Don't you think?""

Just then, Zoe burst through the door, breathless. ""Ms. Patterson, come here, Luna collapsed. Her face is blue. I didn't dare move her.""

Valerie let out a sharp gasp and spun toward Clayton. ""What should I do? She had an episode yesterday too. Clayton, I'm scared.""

Clayton didn't hesitate. He turned around and went toward the living room. ""Calm down. Let's take her to the hospital right away.""

""Thank goodness you're here,"" Valerie said, sticking close to him. ""Feel my hands. I'm freezing.""

As Clayton grabbed his car keys, he suddenly thought of Audrey. His hand paused mid-air.

He turned back and looked at her, saying. ""Vally is still new to Ironhaven. She doesn't know the hospitals here. I'll take Luna to see the doctor first. Can we talk later?""

Audrey stared back at him, her face blank. She didn't give him any response.

Clayton frowned, and Valerie instantly took his arm and said, ""What if something happens to Luna? If she dies, I won't want to live.""

Without another word, Clayton grabbed the keys and rushed out the door.

Valerie followed right behind him, but before stepping outside, she turned around and shot Audrey a smug little look‚Äîone that screamed, 'See? You lost again, Audrey. I'm the one Clayton cares about above all.'

Audrey stood by the window and watched as Clayton carried Luna to the car, and Valerie slipped into the passenger seat. To any outsider, they'd look like a perfect family.

Audrey thought bitterly, 'How ridiculous. Her own kid passed out. Instead of checking on her, that woman ran straight to Clayton.

'What if he weren't here? Would she watch her daughter die? Either Clayton's too blind to see through this pathetic act or he enjoys playing her hero.'

Zoe then left too, and the house finally went quiet. Audrey went back to the bedroom and started packing her things. She wasn't going to keep tolerating this broken marriage‚Äînot for another day.

Clayton was a lawyer. If he refused to divorce, she'd have to sue him, and she knew she'd be at a disadvantage. But she wasn't scared. It was hard, but it didn't mean it was impossible.

Back when they got married on impulse, Clayton suggested they take a year to get to know each other before becoming a ""real"" couple. Audrey agreed, but on one condition‚Äîshe'd buy her own house with her own money.

Now, she felt relieved that she made that decision. At least she still left herself a way out.

Audrey took out her suitcase and started packing her clothes and documents. Then, she opened her jewelry box on the vanity. Inside was the diamond necklace Clayton bought her. The diamond wasn't huge, but it cost over ten grand.

She'd barely worn it, afraid it looked too flashy. Now, all she could think was how stupid she'd been.

She never asked Clayton to stop giving money to his parents. During holidays, she always paid out of her own pocket to buy his parents some gifts to avoid conflict.

She didn't spend a dime of Clayton's money, yet Valerie and her kid were living off Clayton just fine.

Audrey took a deep breath, opened a drawer, and grabbed the incident report and withdrawal form from Ashwood Mental Hospital, along with the clean bill of health the doctor gave her when she was discharged.

Then she hailed a cab and went straight to the apartment she bought herself‚Äîonly to find the lock code had been changed.

Furious, she called the police. The police showed up with the building's property manager in tow.

The manager looked nervous as hell and explained, ""Mrs. Patel, Mr. Patel told us that woman and her daughter would move in.""

Audrey held up her property deed and declared, ""I'm the legal owner here. No one can move in without my permission. That's trespassing. Officer, I want the door opened under your supervision. If they damaged my place, I'm holding them and this property company accountable.""

The manager wiped the sweat from his forehead and called in a locksmith. When the door swung open, even the police and the manager looked stunned.

The house was originally done in minimalist style‚Äîwhite walls, light tiles, nothing fancy. Audrey didn't have enough budget to renovate it, but it was clean and livable.

Audrey once ordered all the furniture online. Clayton told her the dimensions were wrong and the stuff had to be returned. Thus, they didn't move in yet.

But now, they really couldn't move in.

The floor was covered with takeout boxes, trash bags, soggy delivery containers, and so on. The once-pristine walls were scribbled with markers in every color. There were dark stains everywhere‚Äîgod knows what caused them.

In the bedroom, bras and stockings were tossed all over the place. The air reeked of some cheap fruity perfume.

The plants Audrey had bought to clear out the formaldehyde were crammed onto the balcony, dried up like museum specimens.

With the police and building manager present, Audrey snapped photos of everything for evidence. Then she called a moving company. In front of everyone, she packed up all the junk, sealed it in boxes, and had it shipped off to Clayton's place in Hightower Homes.

When that was done, she asked the police for a formal incident report, changed the lock, and headed to her office to deal with her resignation procedure.

\*\*\*\*\*

At Ironhaven Medical Center, Clayton's good friend Carson Wilson pulled some strings to get Luna checked out fast.

After the exam, the doctor said, ""She had an allergic reaction that led to temporary airway obstruction. You'll need to figure out what triggered it. She got here in time, so she's currently fine. Still, don't take it lightly.""

""Thank you, doctor."" Valerie's eyes were full of tears. She clung to Clayton and said, ""Clay, I don't know what I would've done without you.""

But she noticed Clayton seemed distracted. Normally, the moment Valerie started crying, Clayton would be right there comforting her. Yet just now, when she tried to lean on him, he actually dodged a bit.

Valerie's heart dropped, and she thought, 'No. I can't let him slip away. Clayton is mine. I have to keep him mine.'

Through tears, she said, ""This is all my fault. I shouldn't have left Luna outside like that. But you know what Audrey did last time.

""Luna already has autism, and she's still scared from that scene. I didn't have a choice but to leave her in the living room.""

# Chapter 4 Audrey's Fight Back

""You know Luna is my whole world,"" Valerie sobbed, covering her face with both hands. ""Back then, I took beatings just to protect her. If anything happens to her now because of my carelessness, I won't forgive myself.""

Hearing her cry, Clayton felt a sudden wave of irritation rising in his chest.

He said, ""The doctor said she's fine. Don't beat yourself up. Honestly, getting her out of that mess is already brave. I've got stuff to deal with. You stay here and look after Luna, okay?""

A bad feeling crept up Valerie's spine. She asked cautiously, ""Are you worried Audrey will be mad? I can take Luna and leave. I swear we won't cause you any trouble.""

""You don't have to leave,"" Clayton replied, rubbing his temples. ""It's something at the firm.""

The real reason Clayton had Audrey sent to Ashwood Mental Hospital on her birthday was because she cut Valerie's hand. Valerie's reputation was just a minor cause.

He thought getting Audrey out of the picture would calm Valerie down, and then maybe she'd agree to drop the charges. If Audrey ended up with a record, she'd be blacklisted from half the job market.

Clayton had connections at Ashwood‚Äîhis law firm handled some of their legal affairs. He personally asked the manager to put Audrey in a quiet, nicer section of the hospital and told him she just needed time to cool off.

""Audrey is not the kind to hold grudges,"" Clayton added absentmindedly.

Valerie almost lost control of her expression. She opened her mouth to say more, but Clayton had already turned around and left the ward.

Carson, waiting outside the ward, walked down the stairs with Clayton. Carson said, ""Look, man, don't take this the wrong way, but Valerie's got a strange look in her eyes when she sees you.""

Clayton shot Carson a look that could freeze hell. He warned, ""Say that again, and you're not my friend anymore.""

""Alright, alright."" Carson raised his hands in surrender. ""I'm done. Just keep your eyes open. Audrey's not your match, but she's been really good to you.""

Clayton's eyes flickered, then he turned around and left the hospital. Carson stood there watching him leave and shaking his head.

None of the guys in their circles planned to get married, and they definitely hadn't supported Clayton's impulsive marriage just to spite his family for arranging an alliance for him.

But Audrey's devotion after they got married made a few of them reconsider the whole bachelor lifestyle.

When Clayton brought Valerie back into the picture and started putting her first in everything, Carson warned him not to keep Audrey in the dark.

On Audrey's birthday, Clayton had planned to finally come clean. But they were a bit late, and the accident happened.

Once Valerie was sure the two men had left, the soft worry and guilt drained from her face in an instant. Her whole expression turned cold as she looked at Luna lying on the bed.

She muttered, ""Useless. Couldn't you have eaten a few more chestnuts? You are in no danger. Clay didn't even care to stay.""

Luna's small frame shrank into itself. Her head was too big for her frail body. She stared at her mother, her eyes wide with fear and confusion.

Just minutes after Clayton walked out, Audrey stepped into the hospital.

Carson spotted Audrey and assumed she was there to give Valerie a hard time. He was about to call Clayton when he overheard two nurses whispering nearby.

The first nurse said, ""Oh my, no one can stop them? Beating people is illegal.""

Another nurse replied, ""A 10-year-old or so boy died there last year. His folks spent six months in court. In the end, they called it an accident and got a little compensation.""

Carson walked over and said behind them, ""You two work here or just gossip for a living?""

The nurses giggled upon seeing Carson. He was kind of a big deal around here, returning from abroad with a flashy resume.

The first nurse explained, ""We were talking about Ashwood Mental Hospital, Dr. Wilson. That place is hell. I don't get why some parents send their kids there just to get them beat up.""

The other nurse added, ""The owners have people backing them. If someone gets hurt or even dies, they just throw money at it. That woman had bruises all over. Hope she gets some justice.""

Carson's brows furrowed upon hearing that. He knew Clayton had sent Audrey to Ashwood.

Lots of kids had behavioral issues, tech addictions, and attitude problems. It was said Ashwood could straighten them out.

Carson didn't think giving troubled teens a little tough love was a big deal. As far as he was concerned, a place like Ashwood Mental Hospital had its uses. Plus, Clayton knew the manager there, and Audrey was an adult, so surely they'd treat her differently.

""You can't write off a whole institution just because of a few bad stories. If it exists, there's a reason,"" Carson said before heading back to his office.

That conversation made him forget all about calling Clayton.

Meanwhile, Audrey sat in a park, holding her injury report. The staff at Ashwood didn't dare beat her outright, but they played all kinds of mental games and messed with her food.

When she caught wind of her release, she used a bathroom break to rough herself up a bit. The bruises looked terrifying but weren't actually deep.

She waited until nearly 4 p.m. before spotting a familiar figure rushing by. Audrey stood up and called out, ""Mr. Sanchez.""

Leo Sanchez, Ashwood's manager, was in his forties with a beer belly. He strode like he had something urgent to do. He glanced at Audrey and instantly looked annoyed.

""Audrey? What do you want?"" he snapped, not even bothering to call her ""Mrs. Patel"".

Audrey crooked her finger at him, signaling for him to sit on the bench.

Leo's face turned grim. He snapped, ""If you've got something to say, spit it out. I'm busy.""

""Are you rushing to Little Dreamers Preschool to pick up your lovechild?"" Audrey raised her voice.

Leo's face turned an ugly shade of red. His eyes were filled with panic and fury.

No one was supposed to know about the kid he had with his mistress, but he didn't know how Audrey found out.

The park was full of parents with their kids. If anyone heard that, word would spread fast, and he couldn't risk that kind of heat falling on his son.

Grinding his teeth, Leo walked over and sat stiffly on the bench. ""Now, talk.""

Audrey waved the medical report and tossed it onto his lap. ""While I was locked up at Ashwood, I was abused‚Äîphysically and emotionally‚Äîby your staff. I want compensation for medical bills, nutrition recovery, and psychological damage.""

Leo's eyes nearly popped out at the number‚Äî150,000 dollars. He growled, ""This is extortion.""

Audrey let out a cold chuckle. ""Call it what you want. If you think I'm bluffing, I'll go straight to the cops or the press. You pick.""

A smirk flickered in Leo's eyes. He knew Clayton's law firm represented Ashwood. Clayton had personally called to make sure Audrey ""learned her lesson"". He was sure that Clayton would help her with the lawsuit.

""Does Mr. Patel know what you're up to?"" Leo asked.

Audrey thought, 'Trying to use Clayton against me? I used to care about his feelings, but now, I'd skin him alive if I could.'

She folded her arms with a sneer. ""Did Clayton also tell you I've got violent tendencies? Kinda like being legally insane."" Her voice dropped lower. ""So tell me, what would happen if I lost my mind and stabbed your son? Who would the law blame then?""

Leo's face drained of color. Audrey's file did say she had a history of extreme behavior. His staff also reported she was stubborn as hell. When they locked her in solitary, she still refused to admit anything.

Leo thought bitterly, 'This woman is really insane. Ashwood only exists because my father-in-law pulled strings. If they find out I've got a mistress and a secret kid, I'm toast.

'Valerie's about to become Mrs. Patel, anyway. Once the divorce goes through and Audrey's out of the picture, I'll stash my kid somewhere and deal with her then.'

# Chapter 5 I'm Her Family

""Fine. I'll pay your medical bills."" Leo said through clenched teeth.

Audrey tossed a pen onto his lap and said, ""Sign it. Can't have you crying later that I blackmailed you.""

Leo hunched over the paper, his expression murderous. But when he looked up again, his face had smoothed out. He then transferred the 150,000 dollars to her account without a word.

The second Leo stepped out of the park, Audrey sent a message to Leo's wife.

She sneered to herself, 'Think you'll come back for revenge? Keep dreaming. That money wasn't hush money. It was compensation. What Ashwood does behind closed doors will all be shown to the public.'

\*\*\*\*\*

On his way home, Clayton stopped to grab a coffee. Audrey used to say that coffee store had the best flavor and the price.

Just thinking about how happy Audrey would be with the coffee made him smile. But the smile froze the moment he stepped off the elevator.

The hallway outside his apartment was jammed with cardboard boxes, stacked so high that they nearly blocked the door.

One of them had soaked through at the bottom and was leaking something that smelled awful.

Clayton called the manager and then learned that Audrey had moved all of Valerie's stuff out of the new house and dumped it here.

Clayton's face went cold as ice. He wondered, 'She just stayed at Ashwood for a month. I made sure she was taken care of. She didn't even go through the actual rehab program like others.

'I just said she's not the kind to hold grudges, and she did this.'

Clayton immediately called his assistant, Carter Kemp, and ordered him to find a place for Valerie fast. He didn't want her and Luna out on the street tonight.

Carter found a spot in the complex next door and brought a couple of coworkers over to help move the boxes.

Jade from the firm showed up to lend a hand too. She asked, ""Mr. Patel, I heard Luna was hospitalized. Is she okay? What a poor kid. Seeing her mom get beat up like that, no wonder she got autism.""

She peeked into the apartment, didn't see Audrey, and lowered her voice. ""Isn't Audrey going too far? Kicking Vally and her daughter out like that is heartless.""

Clayton instinctively replied, ""That apartment belongs to Audrey.""

Jade scoffed, ""So that gives her the right to bully others?"" She bent down to lift a box, not noticing the dark look on Clayton's face.

She added, ""She has no family and no background. If you hadn't taken pity on her, she would've stayed stuck at the bottom forever.""

Lawyers had this special kind of social image, just like doctors or cops. They brought hope when people hit rock bottom. And Clayton, with his high-profile wins for the underdog, was seen as almost heroic.

Lawyers could reach both the working class and the elite. The job itself was a ladder. Jade thought without Valerie stepping away, Audrey would've never gotten a chance to marry a man like Clayton.

""Jade."" Clayton's tone went ice-cold, his eyes sharp. ""Audrey is my wife. I'm her family.""

Hearing that, Jade turned pale, and she muttered inwardly, 'I thought Mr. Patel was into Valerie. Didn't think he'd actually defend Audrey.'

""Jade, come on, I've already made two trips,"" Carter cut in, trying to shift the tension. ""If we drag this out any longer, Luna's gonna be out of the hospital before we're done.""

Jade carried a box into the elevator, still fuming. She sneered in her mind, 'Audrey just got out of Ashwood and already thinks she can throw Vally's stuff out? She really thinks she can throw a tantrum at Mr. Patel?

'Once he dumps her, she'll beg for scraps. For women like her, marrying a guy like Mr. Patel is like winning the lottery. And instead of holding onto that ticket, she's just out here lighting it on fire.'

""Ugh, what the hell is in this box?"" As soon as the elevator doors opened, Jade dropped the box. Takeout containers rolled out across the floor. She complained, ""Did she seriously pack trash into these boxes? What is wrong with her?""

She glanced over her shoulder, worried Clayton might've followed. When she didn't see him, she kicked the box hard and said, ""Carter, I got my clothes tainted. I'm going home to change.""

Once everything was done, Clayton sat alone in his car, exhaustion dragging down his face.

That case he'd been working on recently had been a mess, so he left Audrey in Ashwood a few extra days just to deal with it. The second he had a breather, he brought her home and even asked Zoe to cook her favorite dishes.

He honestly didn't get it. He had promised that once Valerie and Luna settled down, he'd hand over the rest of his salary to Audrey. He couldn't understand why Audrey still threw a tantrum like this.

Frustration flared in his chest, and he thought, 'Just because I took Luna to the hospital, she dumped all of Vally's stuff here? Valerie's been through enough already. Luna's got serious autism for God's sake. That woman is unreasonable.'

He glanced at the cup of coffee in the passenger seat‚Äîthe one he bought for Audrey. His jaw clenched. Without a second thought, he grabbed it and chucked it out of the window into a trash can.",1,1750665064.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

# Chapter One

Blair was so grateful to be home. She just didn‚Äôt understand the demon that had possessed her boss during their recent business trip. He had driven everyone hard. They arrived home one day earlier than planned, but she was glad to be away from him.

She had expected to return to the office with him. To her surprise, he gave her the rest of the afternoon off. Maybe he‚Äôd decided they both needed a break. That was fine by her.

Lately, he‚Äôd been a real shithead. Short-tempered and demanding. When he dropped her off at her front door, she almost flipped him the bird. She paused, unsure whether he‚Äôd catch the gesture in the rear-view mirror.

Roman had this uncanny ability to sense everything. It was almost like he had eyes in the back of his head. You‚Äôd think being gorgeous would make him a bit easier to work with. But no. If anything, it made him more of an ass. He was hot, and he knew it. Most everyone always fell at his feet trying to please the man.

She didn‚Äôt know what was going on. Roman had seemed more irritable in the past few months. He‚Äôd been rubbing her the wrong way. Of the two years she‚Äôd worked for him, these last two months had been the worst. If he didn‚Äôt pay her so well, or if she didn‚Äôt need the job so badly, maybe she would tell him where to go.

Blair shook her head. That wasn‚Äôt true. Despite his sometimes shitty attitude, Roman did look after his staff. The benefits at Kingston‚Äôs were great. People put up with more for the right perks.

The office offered excellent medical and dental coverage. There was always childcare within the building, and the company was cutting back on maternity leave. It was a win-win for Kingston.

Blair picked up her case and headed for the front door of the townhouse she shared with her cousin Laura and her fianc√© Dan.

She checked her watch as she reached the front door. Dan wouldn‚Äôt be home for a few hours. She planned to surprise him with a romantic dinner.

Laura was rarely home at night, always out partying. Her cousin was a model-not a supermodel, but still gorgeous. She knew how to make the most of it. Blair, on the other hand, wasn‚Äôt interested in clothes or makeup. She was more into books.

They had both moved to the city for different reasons. Laura to follow her modeling career and for Blair, it had been a chance to work for a great company like Kingston Industries. Under normally the great man himself Roman Kingston. The company had their fingers in so many pies, Blair was never bored. Even when Roman was being his most demanding. She loved her job.

Fishing for her keys. She juggled her briefcase, handbag, and suitcase. Once the key was in the lock, it turned easily. Blair pushed the door open. Stepping inside, she put her handbag and suitcase down at the bottom of the stairs. Before heading into the lounge room where she kept a desk. Sitting her briefcase on top.

Blair turned to make her way to the kitchen, pondering what to prepare for dinner. As she walked past the foot of the stairs, a sudden noise from upstairs caused her to halt in her tracks. Was there someone else in the house? Had she returned home to an intruder? Filled with panic, Blair took a step towards the front door, ready to flee.

However, at that moment, she realized something. Laura. Unlike Blair and Dan, Laura didn‚Äôt adhere to their typical working hours. She often slept late and stayed out until the early hours of the morning. It wasn‚Äôt the first time Blair had found her slumped on the front steps as she was leaving for work in the morning. Blair wasn‚Äôt sure if she should call out now. What if it wasn‚Äôt her cousin?

Her eyes scanned the room for something to defend herself with‚Ä¶ just in case. Her gaze landed on her late father‚Äôs baseball bat, which she always kept near the front door when she was home alone at night. It made her feel safer.

She grabbed the bat, weighting it in her hand for a moment. Before she set foot on the stairs, she paused, wondering if any of them creaked. She couldn‚Äôt remember. Taking a deep breath to steady her racing heart, Blair ascended the stairs slowly, step by step.

When she reached the landing, she stopped, straining to listen.

‚ÄúPlease be Laura. Please be Laura, and not some masked man waiting to jump out at me,‚Äù she muttered under her breath.

The hallway stretched ahead, with four doors. Three led to the bedrooms, and one opened to the shared bathroom. The only door ajar was the one to her and Dan‚Äôs bedroom. The others were shut. But to get to her bedroom, she‚Äôd have to pass the other doors.

That‚Äôs when she heard it, the unmistakable sound of a giggle from Laura, followed by a low, male groan. Relief flooded her chest. It wasn‚Äôt a burglar. Laura had brought someone home.

Just as Blair was about to turn away and leave, she heard the voice of the man Laura was with.

‚ÄúGod, yes,‚Äù the voice groaned.

Blair froze, her heart pounding. No. It couldn‚Äôt be.

‚ÄúLaura, you‚Äôre so fucking hot,‚Äù Dan‚Äôs voice came from their bedroom.

Her eyes widened. Dan. In their bed. With Laura. Blair‚Äôs stomach lurched.

This couldn‚Äôt be happening. She moved quietly down the hall until she stood outside her bedroom door, praying this was all some kind of terrible misunderstanding.

With a trembling hand, she pushed the door open.

The sight that greeted her was like a punch to the gut. She staggered backward, her mind unable to process what she was seeing.

There, in the middle of the bed, was Dan, flat on his back, with Laura straddling him, completely naked. She was moving up and down on him, her hands gripping his chest hair. From this angle, Blair could see Dan‚Äôs cock thrusting in and out of Laura. It felt like she was watching a scene from a porn film.

Dan‚Äôs hands gripped Laura‚Äôs waist and ass, guiding her movements.

‚ÄúErr, yes, fuck me harder,‚Äù Laura moaned.

Blair lifted a hand to her mouth to stop herself from crying out. No, no, no, no.

Dan‚Äôs grip tightened on Laura‚Äôs ass, spreading her cheeks wider.

Blair had never seen Laura naked before, not that it mattered when she was currently riding Blair‚Äôs fianc√©.

How could she do this? They had both watched Laura‚Äôs father, Peter, cheat repeatedly on Laura‚Äôs mother, creating a toxic home life. Blair had lived with them after losing her parents in a plane crash ten years ago. She had thought if anyone would understand the devastation of betrayal, it would be Laura.

This had to be a nightmare. Blair pinched herself, hard, as the sting registered immediately. Not a nightmare.

Dan had always hated Laura. He‚Äôd called her a slut. Mocked her outfits. Said she was shallow, incapable of real conversation.

Was it all a lie? Had he been jealous of the men in her life? Was that why?

One thing was certain, Dan‚Äôs mother, Paula, would never accept Laura as a suitable wife for her son.

But none of that mattered now. What was she supposed to do? How did someone handle this? It was like a scene from a B-grade movie.

She couldn‚Äôt pretend she hadn‚Äôt seen it. She didn‚Äôt want Dan anymore‚Ä¶ not now, not after this. Taking him back would be disgusting.

How long had this been going on?

They had been living together for five months. Dan had moved in with her and Laura to save money before the wedding. Had he been fucking Laura the whole time?

‚ÄúLaura, you are so goddamn tight,‚Äù Dan groaned, arching his back.

‚ÄúIs my pussy better than Blair‚Äôs?‚Äù Laura asked, riding him harder.

Blair‚Äôs heart stopped. Did she know Blair was standing here? Had she asked that on purpose?

Blair bit into her hand to keep from making a sound. She had given Dan her virginity. He had known what that meant to her. Knowing that he had done this.

She hadn‚Äôt even planned to be home today. She had wanted to surprise him.

The surprise had been on her.

She felt sick. A cold sweat broke over her skin.

Her other hand came up, gripping the doorframe for balance. Something solid pressed against her palm. The bat.

For a fleeting second, she thought about using it. Smashing the bed, the nightstand, the both of them. But she wasn‚Äôt that person. She rested the bat against the doorframe just in case she changed her mind and used it on them.

So instead, she straightened her spine. Let the rage steel her so when she finally spoke, her voice was calm. Icy, emotionless.

‚ÄúWhile you two finish up, should I cook dinner?‚Äù

# Chapter Two

‚ÄúFuck me.‚Äù Dan's head came up off the bed as he pushed Laura off his body. Blair could see the horror on his face when he saw her standing at the door. He‚Äôd been caught with his pants down, or off, as it was in this case. Laura scrambled across the bed, pulling a blanket over her naked body. Her face was filled with shock, showing her cousin hadn‚Äôt known of Blair‚Äôs presence. The expression she wore was incredibly real and impossible to fake.

‚ÄúNo thanks. Looks like Laura has taken care of that for you.‚Äù Blair was surprised how calm she sounded. When all she truly wanted to do was scream and shout and throw things. What would it accomplish? She would still have a broken relationship.

‚ÄúBlair! What are you doing home today?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs cock was wet and laying limp against his leg. Having his fiance walk in on him mustn‚Äôt be a turn on, it would seem.

Blair lifted an eyebrow at him. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what you are worried about? Might be an idea to cover up.‚Äù

Blair was watching Dan with narrowed eyes. She had loved him, but the person she saw now was ugly to her. It didn‚Äôt matter anymore that he was very attractive. To her, he was ugly. No one should cheat on someone they claimed to love. Even if someone had held a gun to her head, she would have refused. It was a shame Dan hadn‚Äôt felt the same. As far as she could see, Laura hadn‚Äôt needed to force him. Hearing them talk during the act had told her that.

Blair put the bat down, resting it against the wall near the door. Just in case. She told herself that she wouldn‚Äôt use it, but who knew? Crimes of passion that had to have come from somewhere. Normal everyday people committing a crime in the heat of the moment. So it was safer if she put it down. Blair then crossed her arms across her chest. Looking back to see Dan had gotten off the bed and was pulling on his work pants.

She flicked her eyes to Laura. The bitch now had a smug look on her face. It had replaced the look of shock. Why?

Blood was roaring in her ears as she came to terms with the total destruction of her personal life. She never wanted to see him again, but she and Dan both worked for Kingston. She had applied first. Dan hadn‚Äôt joined the company until a year later.

Blair decided then and there she would not be leaving her job. It was her only concrete thing she could hang onto, then she was keeping it. It wasn‚Äôt like they work directly together.

Dan took a step towards her, reaching out his hand. ‚ÄúBaby..‚Äù

Blair took a step back. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you dare touch me?‚Äù Not only could she not stomach it, but who knows where that hand had been?

The venom in Blair's voice brought him up short. He turned to look at Laura before returning his eyes to her face. Blair knew she was pale. Who wouldn‚Äôt be?

‚ÄúYou have to believe me. This was a one time thing. It will never happen again. It meant nothing.‚Äù Dan pleaded with her.

Blair could see the look on Laura's face. Even before seeing it, she knew he was lying. Dan had a tell. When he lied, his right eyebrow would go up. Before today, the lies had never been a big deal, just little things. Had she noticed it when he had talked about Laura in the past? Blair wasn‚Äôt sure. Because sometimes the sub-conscious mind could even fool ourselves.

‚ÄúDo you know Dan? It doesn‚Äôt matter.‚Äù Blair angled her chin up as her nails dug into her palm. ‚ÄúThis one time was all it took.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat.. No, Blair baby please, I love you.‚Äù Dan tried to take her in his arms.

Blair moved quickly, picked up the bat, and swung it so the end pressed up against his chest, pushing him back and holding him at bay. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt even think about it.‚Äù

Dan looked down at the bat, raising his hands back at his shoulder level. ‚ÄúPlease, she seduced me. You know what a slut she is. I was missing you.‚Äù

They both heard the gasp from the bed. Before Laura responded. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lying Blair. This has been going on for months. Soon after, he moved in.‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, you dumb bitch.‚Äù Dan turned to yell at her. Before saying to Blair. ‚ÄúShe is lying.‚Äù

Blair shrugged. ‚ÄúDoesn‚Äôt matter. It only took the one time Dan.‚Äù She nudged him with the baseball bat. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt call Laura a dumb bitch. I may never forgive her for this, but you were the one in a relationship, Dan, not her.‚Äù Blair could see Laura sliding out of the bed, scrambling around for her clothing, still holding the sheet to her breasts. ‚ÄúIf you think she is a slut, what the fuck does that make you?‚Äù Blair knew she would not feel clean even if she had ten showers. This was going to take time.

Blair knew she couldn‚Äôt deal with anymore right now. She needed to leave before they were both dressed. She needed to think, to process. Turning on her heel, she ran down the stairs. Quickly grabbing the suitcase, handbag. Blair only just remembered the briefcase as she was about to leave through the front door.

‚ÄúYou stupid slut, why did you have to say anything?‚Äù Dan‚Äôs angry voice came from upstairs

Blair rushed to her desk, picked up the briefcase and stood at the front door, ready to leave. Knowing once she walked through it, she wasn‚Äôt coming back. She had no idea where she was going, but anywhere was better than here.

Following Dan‚Äôs insult came Laura's high-pitched squeal. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not a slut Dan.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou and your big mouth. You wanted this to happen, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù Dan accused.

Blair could hear the tears in Laura's voice. ‚ÄúYou didn‚Äôt mind my mouth when it was sucking your cock.‚Äù

‚ÄúShh.‚Äù Dan was worried she was hearing their argument. ‚ÄúYou set me up, didn‚Äôt you? You knew she was coming home.‚Äù

‚ÄúDan I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù Laura cried.

If she stayed any longer, both of them would have gotten dressed and then they would come down here, and she didn‚Äôt want another confrontation.

Taking a deep breath, Blair stepped through the front door, not looking back even as she heard Dan calling her name from inside the house.

# Chapter Three

Blair waved down a taxi. She shoved open the taxi door and climbed into the backseat as quickly as she could, intent on getting out of here as fast as possible. She felt like getting drunk. But if she went to a bar alone during the day, that would be inviting trouble. She could feel the tears as they slid unchecked down her face. She had held herself together while she had confronted Dan and Laura.

‚ÄúWhere to?‚Äù the driver asked, his voice cutting through the fog in her brain.

Where to? Good question.

Home wasn‚Äôt an option. Sutton and Keira were at work, and she didn‚Äôt want to sit in their empty apartment, replaying the image of Dan tangled in her cousin‚Äôs sheets. She needed a drink. But sitting alone in a bar in the middle of the afternoon? That felt like waving a white flag.

She hesitated, then rattled off the address of her office. At least there, she could pretend to be productive. Maybe even figure out what the hell to do next.

The taxi pulled away from the kerb and she exhaled, trying to steady herself.

The driver looked at her in the rearview mirror. ‚ÄúThere are tissues in the center compartment if you need them, hon.‚Äù

The driver‚Äôs voice was gentle, like he‚Äôd seen enough women cry in his backseat to know when to speak and when to keep quiet.

Blair grabbed a handful. ‚ÄúThanks.‚Äù She said before cleaning her face as best she could. It wasn‚Äôt like she wore a lot of makeup. So she might as well clean her face.

Her phone began to ring. Dan.

She still pulled it out of her to check. Her stomach clenched as she stared at the screen, his name glowing in bright white letters.

She could just imagine the first words he would say.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not what it looks like, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can explain.‚Äù

‚ÄúPlease, just let me talk to you.‚Äù

Lies. Excuses. The same bullshit men always spewed when they got caught.

She set the phone to silent and shoved it back into her bag.

By the time the taxi pulled up in front of the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries, her makeup was beyond saving. She reached into her purse, dug out a crumpled twenty, and handed it to the driver.

‚ÄúBe honest,‚Äù she said, forcing a smile. ‚ÄúDo I look like a woman who just found out her fianc√© is screwing her cousin?‚Äù

The driver hesitated, giving her a careful once-over. ‚ÄúYour eyes are a little red, honey, but it‚Äôs hardly noticeable.‚Äù He paused. ‚ÄúAre you going to be okay?‚Äù

The unexpected kindness nearly undid her.

She swallowed the lump in her throat and nodded. ‚ÄúYeah. Better to find out now, right? Just a little dump on the road of life.‚Äù She wasn‚Äôt sure who she was trying to convince the taxi driver or herself.

After paying the driver in cash, she climbed out of the taxi, hoisted her suitcase onto the curb and took a deep breath. Blair checked her phone screen to see Dan had called her six times and left six messages on her voicemail. Uninterested in what he had to say for himself, she slid the phone away in her handbag.

Blair turned toward the towering glass and steel structure of Kingston Industries. Roman had bought the building five years ago. The top eight floors belonged to Kingston, the lower three rented out to smaller businesses. With the way the company was expanding, she wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they took over the whole thing eventually.

She walked inside, adjusting her bag on her shoulder.

‚ÄúMiss Warner, Can I help you?‚Äù Blair blinked. Maggie, one of the receptionists, had stepped out from behind the lobby front desk, her gaze flicking over Blair.

Maggie stepped forward, taking the suitcase from her. In the same hand, she was still holding the bat. Blair had completely forgotten that she was even holding it in her hand.

Blair had walked into the office looking like she was about to commit a felony. She was relieved, though. It was something she wouldn‚Äôt need to retrieve later.

Blair exhaled, relieved. ‚ÄúThanks, Maggie. Can I leave everything here while I freshen up?‚Äù She was surprised her voice sounded so... normal.

‚ÄúOf course, Miss Warner.‚Äù Maggie‚Äôs eyes darted to the bat again.

‚ÄúBlair, please. How many times do I have to tell you?‚Äù Roman preferred first names, but some staff-especially the newer ones-struggled with that.

More with Roman than with her.

Maggie smiled, taking the suitcase, briefcase, and bat.

Blair headed across the foyer to the restroom.

Inside, she went straight to the mirrors. The cab driver hadn‚Äôt just been kind. She really didn‚Äôt look that bad. She pulled a makeup wipe from her bag and cleaned off the last remnants of mascara. A quick dusting of powder, some lip gloss, a little eyeliner.

She pinched her cheeks. People always said that added color, but she didn‚Äôt see a difference.

Her blue eyes were still a little red, but there wasn‚Äôt much she could do about that. She pulled out a brush, freed her long, wavy blonde hair from its bun, and redid it neatly. Good enough.

She left the restroom, retrieved her belongings from Maggie, and headed to the elevators. As she waited, she tried to recall Roman‚Äôs schedule. Did he have any meetings this afternoon?

Then it hit her. He shouldn‚Äôt have been home today. So no meetings were scheduled in his calendar.

She sighed. Her brain was fried. But walking in on your fianc√© shagging your cousin would do that to anyone.

The thought made her frown.

How often had they been doing this? Dan had been at home during a workday. She traveled occasionally for work, but not that often. If their affair had been going on for months, they had to have been meeting up on company time.

The elevator arrived. A woman she didn‚Äôt recognize stepped in with her.

Blair offered a polite, strained smile. When the woman got off at the second floor, Blair leaned back against the wall, staring at nothing.

Should she tell Roman about Dan? It would feel like sour grapes-tattling just because he cheated. But he was also ripping off the company. No way could he get home, have sex with Laura, and get back to the office during a lunch break.

The elevator dinged open. Blair inhaled deeply before stepping onto the executive floor.

Kara, the receptionist on the executive floor, looked up. ‚ÄúHey, Blair. I didn‚Äôt think you‚Äôd be in today.‚Äù

Blair smiled. ‚ÄúWasn‚Äôt planning to be, but I figured I‚Äôd get a jump on the meeting notes for Roman. Is he in?‚Äù

Kara shook her head. ‚ÄúNo, he left a little while ago. Called to have his calls held.‚Äù

Blair almost sagged in relief. She wouldn‚Äôt have to face him just yet.

‚ÄúThanks, Kara.‚Äù

She went to her office, shut the door, and sank into her chair.

Blair rested her head on the desk. Shit. She felt like a wrecking ball had just split her world in two.

How could he? But even worse than that, how could Laura?

The childish problems they had all had as kids, Blair had thought, they had grown out of that. Laura had always been a spoiled brat. Taking what wasn‚Äôt hers.

The problem was her parents, Blair‚Äôs aunt and uncle, doted on her and gave her everything she wanted. But when they had moved to the city two years ago, Laura hadn‚Äôt been that bad or by now Blair would have moved in with her sisters. She hadn‚Äôt when Sutton had come back from Europe because her sister Keira had just finished university. Keira had moved in with Sutton. She would have felt guilty leaving Laura on her own to move in with her sisters. What was the point, anyway? She and Dan had planned on getting a place of their own once they were married.

Lifting her head, Blair looked down at the ring on her finger. The engagement ring Dan had given her.

It wasn‚Äôt big. She hadn‚Äôt wanted big. She would make sure he got it back. He could sell it. Because she was sure Laura would want a big flashy ring. She had made fun of Blair‚Äôs ring.

Taking it off, Blair was about to throw it across the room. No, just in case it went missing. Opening the top drawer of her desk, Blair dropped it in, slamming it shut. She needed a drink. Standing, Blair went into Roman‚Äôs office, where she knew he kept a bottle of scotch. She wasn‚Äôt much of a spirit drinker, but anything would do.

Roman office was a statement of the man himself. Everything was big, strong, and masculine. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt forget intimidating.‚Äù Blair said to the empty room.

Going to his desk, she opened the bottom drawer and pulled out the bottle of scotch that Roman kept there. Taking it, she sat down on his Chestfield lounge near the window. She opened the bottle and took a drink. Almost coughing it back up. ‚ÄúHoly shit, this shit burns.‚Äù Blair knew it was an expensive bottle Roman only liked the best.

The problem was, it was straight. Why did he like this shit straight? This time, when she put the bottle to her mouth, Blair made sure to sip it this time. Nope, that didn‚Äôt help. But it wasn‚Äôt as bad as the first drink. So she had another. Laying her head back against the lounge. She had come here to think. What was her next move?

Lifting her hand so she could see the dial on her watch, Blair saw it was 3:15pm. She couldn‚Äôt call Sutton or Keira. Not yet. Let them get home from work. Blair planned to ask Sutton and Keira to assist her in organizing getting her stuff from the apartment. Although she didn‚Äôt want to put too much pressure on her older sister, Sutton. She was six months pregnant, and it hadn‚Äôt been an easy pregnancy.

Men. Why were they assholes? First, her boss for being so arrogant and intimidating and sometimes rude. Then Dan, who had been cheating on her with her cousin Laura for months. How low was that? Then there was Luca, the father of Sutton‚Äôs baby. Who had left her high and dry and pregnant?

Then she would see about crashing at their place until she could find somewhere. Their place wasn‚Äôt big enough for three adults and a baby. When it arrived. But it would be great to spend some time with her sisters. Eat ice cream and talk shit about men.

Although Sutton didn‚Äôt even talk about the man that had gotten her pregnant. It was a topic she refused to discuss. Even when their aunt Viv and uncle Peter had demanded answers. Blair lifted the bottle again to her mouth. Only she and Keira knew his first name.

The phone started ringing on Roman‚Äôs desk. Blair tried to ignore it, but as soon as it stop ringing it started again. Blair shifted to the edge of the lounge, rising to her feet. The room seemed to tilt ever so slightly, prompting a quick ‚ÄúOops.‚Äù to escape her lips.

After regaining her balance, she made her way over to the phone and lifted the receiver.

‚ÄúHello?‚Äù she greeted into the handset. Not very professional, she thought.

‚ÄúRoman please.‚Äù Blair knew the voice. It was Claire Robertson. Roman‚Äôs little piece of fluff. It was the best way to describe Claire. She had this stupid girly voice that set Blair‚Äôs teeth on edge.

‚ÄúRoman isn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Blair put a hand on Roman‚Äôs desk to help stop the swaying of the room.

‚ÄúWhere is he?‚Äù Claire asked.

‚ÄúHow the hell should I know?‚Äù Blaire was surprised by her answer. Shit, where had that come from?

‚ÄúYou are his secretary.‚Äù Blair could hear the anger in the other woman‚Äôs voice.

‚ÄúYes, but I‚Äôm not his keeper and I sure as hell don‚Äôt own a crystal ball. Call or message his mobile.‚Äù Blair was over this conversation.

‚ÄúHe isn‚Äôt answering his mobile hasn‚Äôt for days.‚Äù Claire whined.

Blair‚Äôs lips parted slightly. Oh.

That was Roman‚Äôs move. He didn‚Äôt argue, didn‚Äôt make dramatic exits. He just started to avoid before making a clean break. If Claire hadn‚Äôt heard from him in days, it was over. She just didn‚Äôt know it yet.

The little devil on her shoulder made her do it. But Blair couldn‚Äôt help the next words. ‚ÄúWell, one of two things has happened. Either you‚Äôre about to get dumped, or he‚Äôs dead. Either way, flowers will be involved.‚Äù

Blair sighed when she heard the shocked gasp from the other end of the phone, the scotch warming her veins, and loosening her tongue. ‚ÄúLook, Claire, let‚Äôs be honest. He‚Äôs not marriage material. Find someone new.‚Äù She didn‚Äôt wait for a reply, just hung up and dropped the receiver back into place.

She collapsed back onto the Chesterfield, lifting the bottle to her lips again.

Her own problems resurfaced to haunt her. How was she so blind? How did she not pick up on the signs? She wasn‚Äôt an idiot. Dan was a salesman. He had sold her the dream of happily ever after. She had just been blind to the cracks in their relationship.

Not only that, it looked like she had been missing something in her sex life. If what she had witnessed between Dan and Laura was any indication of how the act should be. She enjoyed it well enough, but it wasn‚Äôt something that made her cry out like Laura had been doing. Was that to stroke his ego? Should she have been doing that? The thing was, she didn‚Äôt know.

Dan had been her only lover. It had been his job to teach her.

Blair sighed, lifting the bottle again-only to pause when she noticed two tall, blurry figures standing in front of her.

Wait. No. Not two. Just one.

Blair squinted. ‚ÄúHi.‚Äù

She tried to sit up, bringing the bottle to her mouth, but before she could take another sip, it was plucked from her hand.

‚ÄúHey,‚Äù she protested. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs mine. If you want one, go find your own.‚Äù

She blinked, trying to focus.

The man standing in front of her-the one holding the bottle-came into view.

‚ÄúRoman?‚Äù

‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he said, his voice unreadable. ‚ÄúWhat have you done to yourself?‚Äù

‚ÄúWell,‚Äù she said, slurring slightly, ‚ÄúI think that‚Äôs... pretty obvious. As you can see, I‚Äôm getting shit-faced.‚Äù She reached for the bottle. ‚ÄúNow give it back so I can finish the job.‚Äù

Roman stepped away, placing the bottle on his desk. ‚ÄúI think you‚Äôve had enough.‚Äù

Blair frowned. ‚ÄúYou know... sometimes you can be an asshole. No-most of the time.‚Äù

‚ÄúI do believe you‚Äôre going to regret this tomorrow.‚Äù

Then, to her surprise, he sat down beside her.

# Chapter Four

‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not just an asshole, but a shithead too... always thought so,‚Äù Blair slurred, her tongue feeling too heavy in her mouth. She knew she shouldn‚Äôt be saying this, but she couldn‚Äôt stop herself.

Roman chuckled, leaning back. ‚ÄúI think I should get you some coffee.‚Äù

‚ÄúDon‚Äô want it.‚Äù Blair waved a hand dismissively, nearly hitting herself in the face. ‚ÄúI want... a man that ain‚Äôt a cheatin‚Äô rat.‚Äù Her eyes drifted over him, and despite her best efforts, she noticed-really noticed-how attractive he was. ‚ÄúDid you... did you ever cheat on your ex-wife?‚Äù

She‚Äôd met Jessica once. It hadn‚Äôt been a pleasant experience.

Roman‚Äôs expression didn‚Äôt change, but his voice softened. ‚ÄúNot all men cheat, Blair.‚Äù

‚ÄúW-why‚Äôd she leave you then?‚Äù Her head tilted as if she were trying to piece together a puzzle.

‚ÄúThere are a lot of reasons marriages fall apart,‚Äù Roman said, dragging a hand down his face. ‚ÄúNot all of them have to do with cheating on the man‚Äôs part.‚Äù

It took Blair a moment to process that. Then her eyes widened. ‚ÄúShe cheated on you?‚Äù she whispered, as if it were some great secret. ‚ÄúWas she an idiot?‚Äù

Her boss was gorgeous-thick dark hair, intense gray eyes, chiseled cheekbones. And his body... well, from what she could see, it was fine. Not that she‚Äôd ever been interested before. She‚Äôd always been with Dan. Had been with Dan.

Roman reached over, gently lifting her chin with two fingers when her mouth fell open. ‚ÄúI worked a lot. Some would say I drove her to it.‚Äù

Blair blinked at him, then shook her head, making herself dizzy. ‚ÄúThass not an excuse... nope... no, no, no.‚Äù She dropped her head back onto the couch, exhaling loudly. ‚ÄúShould get a divorce before that... cheaters... all of ‚Äòem...‚Äù

Roman studied her with an amused expression. ‚ÄúYou know, this is the most I‚Äôve ever seen you relax around me.‚Äù

Blair lifted a hand lazily. ‚ÄúThass ‚Äòcause you‚Äôre... you‚Äôre normally soooo difficult to deal wit‚Äô‚Äù she muttered, barely able to get the words out.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt apologize for that.‚Äù His lips twitched. ‚ÄúI expect the best. That‚Äôs why this company is where it is today.‚Äù

Blair made a sound that was half a grunt, half a laugh. ‚ÄúSuppose so...‚Äù Her head felt heavy, her thoughts sluggish.

Roman let her sit in silence for a moment before asking, ‚ÄúWhat happened, Blair?‚Äù

She turned her head to look at him, her vision slightly unfocused. ‚ÄúI was an idiot.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy? Because you trusted the wrong person?‚Äù

Blair let out a shaky breath. ‚ÄúDan an‚Äô I grew up together, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, I didn‚Äôt.‚Äù

She nodded. ‚ÄúI... I was always going home... back home, all the time, when I moved to th‚Äô city for this job. He... he got a job at Kingston‚Äôs, and I was happy ‚Äòbout it. Now I wish he wasn‚Äôt here.‚Äù Her voice wobbled, but she refused to cry. Not again. Not for Dan.

‚ÄúSo, the wedding‚Äôs off?‚Äù Roman gestured to her bare finger.

Blair lifted her hand, staring at it for a second before letting it flop back onto her lap. ‚ÄúYep. We didn‚Äôt even have a date set.‚Äù

‚ÄúWho was holding it up?‚Äù

She blinked at him. Why was he askin‚Äô so many questions? Why was he bein‚Äô so... nice? ‚ÄúMe. He wanted to get married last year. I wasn‚Äôt ready.‚Äù

Roman‚Äôs eyes narrowed slightly. ‚ÄúWhy? If you loved him, why did you want to wait?‚Äù

Blair shrugged, though it was a little sloppy. ‚ÄúIf what I saw t‚Äôday was anythin‚Äô to go by...‚Äù She trailed off, frowning. Maybe... maybe she‚Äôd always known somethin‚Äô was off. There was no passion. No fire. She‚Äôd loved Dan, but maybe not the way she was supposed to love the man she was gonna marry.

Right now, she wasn‚Äôt even sad. Just... angry.

‚ÄúWhat happened?‚Äù Roman pressed, his voice gentler now.

Blair‚Äôs face scrunched up as she remembered. ‚ÄúSaw him,‚Äù she slurred. ‚ÄúH-havin‚Äô sex with... ugh.‚Äù She waved a hand, unable to finish the sentence.

Roman‚Äôs jaw tensed. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù

Blair stared at him for a long moment, her head swimming with thoughts she couldn‚Äôt quite hold on to. Then, suddenly, she reached out, grabbing his tie between her fingers.

Roman froze.

Blair stared at the fabric, tracing the pattern with unfocused eyes. She didn‚Äôt know why she did it. Maybe ‚Äòcause she needed to know. Needed to feel something different.

Without another thought, she pulled at the tie, closing the space between them, and pressed her lips to his.

For a moment, he didn‚Äôt move. But then‚Ä¶ Heat. Raw, consuming heat.

Blair gasped into his mouth, the shock of it searing through her. Her hands flew to his shoulders, gripping the fabric of his shirt, desperate to hold on to something solid.

This was different. So different.

Roman pulled back, breathing hard, his gray eyes dark with something unreadable. ‚ÄúBlair,‚Äù he murmured, voice rough. ‚ÄúWe shouldn‚Äôt-‚Äú

She cut him off with another kiss, moving closer, pressing against him.

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù she whispered, her voice trembling.

She needed to forget.

And she wanted‚Ä¶ to feel.",1,1750664677.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Maybe it was a listicle that read like an instruction manual, or a product review with zero personality.

Odds are, you were reading AI-generated content that forgot the most important ingredient: **a human touch**.

**Why should you care?**

Simple, readers can spot ‚Äúrobot writing‚Äù a mile away. If your copy feels sterile, people bounce. If they bounce, Google notices. If Google notices‚Ä¶well, you‚Äôre not climbing any rankings.

But here‚Äôs the thing: AI writing isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, it‚Äôs getting better by the minute. The real question isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúShould I use AI to write content?‚Äù It‚Äôs ‚ÄúHow do I make sure my AI content still *connects*?‚Äù

If your content sounds like everyone else‚Äôs, you blend in. Humanizing your AI copy helps you stand out, keep readers scrolling, and earn Google‚Äôs trust. That‚Äôs not just good writing, it‚Äôs smart SEO.

# Common Pitfalls of AI-Generated Writing

Let‚Äôs be honest, AI is a beast at cranking out words. But is it always good at *choosing* the right words?

***Not so much.***

*Ever read a paragraph like this?*

*‚ÄúThe benefits of AI content creation include numerous benefits that¬†companies in a plethora of ways.‚Äù*

Yikes. (If you‚Äôve seen this, you‚Äôre not alone. AI loves repeating itself when left unchecked.)

**Here‚Äôs what usually goes wrong:**

* **Repetition Overload:** The same phrase shows up. Again. And again.
* **Stiff Structure:** Sentences sound like they were built from a template, not a conversation.
* **Zero Personality:** No jokes, no stories, no ‚ÄúHey, I get you!‚Äù moments.
* **Jargon Overload:** Words like ‚Äúutilize‚Äù instead of ‚Äúuse,‚Äù or ‚Äúimplement‚Äù instead of ‚Äútry.‚Äù

**So how do you fix it?**

Start by editing like a real human. Break up repetitive patterns, add contractions and direct address (‚Äúyou,‚Äù ‚Äúwe‚Äù), and don‚Äôt be afraid to toss in a quick story or parenthetical (‚Äú(Seriously, I‚Äôve seen AIs recommend ‚Äòenhanced enhancements‚Äô).‚Äù)

**Bottom line:**

AI is a great tool, but it needs your style. Treat every draft as a starting point, and make sure the final version sounds like you, not a bot.

https://preview.redd.it/56guhcaerm8f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe4fb42fb2ae2721adc6e72afe7b849a0ad481bd

# Techniques to Humanize Your AI Content

So, you‚Äôve got a draft straight from your favorite AI. Not bad‚Ä¶but still not you. Here‚Äôs how to inject personality, flow, and genuine connection, without breaking a sweat.

**Start with a Conversation, Not a Monologue**

Picture yourself chatting with your reader over coffee. Use phrases you‚Äôd say out loud, ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the deal,‚Äù ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs break it down,‚Äù or ‚ÄúEver noticed‚Ä¶?‚Äù

(Hint: If you can‚Äôt imagine saying it, don‚Äôt write it.)

**Contractions Are Your Best Friend**

AI loves formal language. Real people? Not so much.

Say ‚Äúyou‚Äôre‚Äù instead of ‚Äúyou are.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs‚Äù instead of ‚Äúit is.‚Äù

Small tweak, huge difference.

https://preview.redd.it/ivgqnljwrm8f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=99cf8722b564a1d7dd1e415b0799b6fdb0448d58

**Drop in Questions - And Answer Them**

Why? Because questions pull readers in.

*‚ÄúCan AI content really sound human?‚Äù*

Absolutely, if you know what to tweak.

**Sprinkle in Mini Stories and Real Examples**

Nothing makes a post feel more human than a quick anecdote or real-world tip.

*‚ÄúI once ran the same intro through two AIs. One sounded like an instruction manual, the other like a text from a friend. Guess which one I published?‚Äù*

**Break the Wall with Asides**

Don‚Äôt be afraid to ‚Äúwhisper‚Äù to your reader.(Seriously, try adding a parenthetical once per section. It‚Äôs like an inside joke.)

**Use Lists for Flow, and Skimming**

* Start sentences with verbs (‚ÄúUse,‚Äù ‚ÄúTry,‚Äù ‚ÄúAvoid‚Äù)
* Mix in bold for punch
* Keep it breezy

**So what?**

If your AI draft reads like a brochure, don‚Äôt panic. These quick tweaks will have it sounding more like you, and a lot less like a bot, in no time.

# Optimizing for SEO - Without Sounding Like a Robot

Let‚Äôs be honest: nothing kills a great post faster than stuffing it with awkward keywords. But you still want to rank, right? Here‚Äôs how to get the best of both worlds, *natural voice* and *SEO wins*.

**Lead with Real Questions, Not Robot Phrases**

Don‚Äôt write, ‚ÄúAI human content SEO best practices.‚Äù

Instead, ask: *‚ÄúCan I really get AI content to rank if it sounds like a real person wrote it?‚Äù*

Answer it right away, Google (and readers) love clarity.

**Use Keywords Like You‚Äôd Use Salt**

Sprinkle, don‚Äôt dump.

Mix in natural variations (‚Äúhuman tone,‚Äù ‚Äúauthentic voice,‚Äù ‚Äúreadable copy‚Äù) where they actually fit.

Bold the big ones, *once* per section, max.

https://preview.redd.it/zn0bwi90sm8f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=108efb00b14de8fcf9445b7e442ed0e0ed2095c4

**Schema Markup: Your SEO Wingman**

Want Google to ‚Äúget‚Äù your FAQs, steps, or tool lists? Add schema.

Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôs not as technical as it sounds. Tools like Rank Math make it a breeze.

**Lists and Snippets: Speak Google‚Äôs Language**

* Use numbered steps for ‚Äúhow-tos.‚Äù
* Pop FAQs in their own section.
* Keep answer blocks short, snappy, and direct.

**Jargon? Only if You Explain It**

If you have to drop a phrase like ‚Äúlatent semantic indexing,‚Äù define it in plain English, ‚Äú(It‚Äôs just a fancy way of saying Google understands meaning, not just keywords.)‚Äù

**So what?**

The best SEO happens when your writing helps people first, and search engines second. If your content ‚Äúreads‚Äù well out loud, you‚Äôre doing it right.

https://preview.redd.it/kd8u9y4lrm8f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=a99a84475488eb8a6430b5b08986eec53f5181aa

# Measuring Success & Iterating

Congrats! You‚Äôve humanized your AI content and tuned it for SEO. But how do you know it‚Äôs working? Simple: measure, tweak, repeat.

**Watch the Numbers, But Trust Your Gut, Too**

Track your bounce rate, dwell time, and search rankings with Google Analytics or Search Console.

If readers are sticking around and you‚Äôre climbing in search, you‚Äôre on the right track.

**Ask for Real Feedback**

Send your draft to a colleague or friend. Ask, ‚ÄúDoes this sound like me?‚Äù(If they pause and say, ‚ÄúUmm‚Ä¶kinda,‚Äù you‚Äôve got work to do.)

**Check With AI Detectors, But Don‚Äôt Obsess**

Tools like GPTZero can flag ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù text. But remember: These tools can throw a lot of false positives, and passing the human eye test is what really counts.

https://preview.redd.it/cok2m785sm8f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=8fb1671b4ff5d1641343c39b3ab24658e048dbc8

**Iterate Like a Pro**

Spot a section that feels flat? Rewrite it.

Find a new tool? Try it on your next draft.

Did Google just update? Reread your top posts and update as needed.

**Celebrate Wins, Learn From Misses**

If a post finally nabs a featured snippet, study what worked.If one tanks, dig in, what can you do better?

**Bottom line:**

Great content is never ‚Äúdone.‚Äù The secret isn‚Äôt writing perfectly the first time, it‚Äôs *constantly* sounding more like you and less like everyone else.

https://preview.redd.it/nxiqhwkprm8f1.png?width=1536&format=png&auto=webp&s=ba23ef19c5552ae539651ab6c10d739852537dd9

# Human at Heart, Ranked at the Top

Let‚Äôs land this plane.

You started with a draft that sounded like a robot on autopilot. But now?

You know how to give your words a pulse. You know the tricks, and the tweaks that make AI content sound like it came from your desk, not some anonymous server in the cloud.

**And here‚Äôs the kicker: Google notices, too.**

When your writing reads like a real conversation, people linger.

When people linger, rankings rise.

It‚Äôs not magic.

I‚Äôm 28 and from the UK. Like many of us on here, I'm looking to find a connection that flows. Something you actually look forward to. Rare, but not impossible.



I‚Äôm a massive fiction nerd. After work, all I want is to disappear into another world with a good book. I keep telling myself I‚Äôll get back into reading history, but so far it‚Äôs mostly just Sabaton keeping the dream alive. I‚Äôm seeing them live later this year, which is proof I still love history, even if it‚Äôs in a slightly unconventional way. Definitely better than abandoning it altogether, even if uni tried its best to crush my soul with an enormous reading list I never followed. This is me, master of excuses and self-justifications. üòÄ If you‚Äôre into bands with historical flair or just like great live music, I‚Äôd definitely recommend them.



Currently reading a bit of a guilty pleasure genre. Still fun though. You can ask what it is if you‚Äôre feeling brave. Or guess. Bonus points if you‚Äôve got your own guilty pleasure read, or watch, or playlist to swap.



I‚Äôve also caught the running bug. Help! Got into it on a whim, became even more obsessed after my first race, and now I‚Äôm deep in the running cult. I‚Äôm not above posting my Strava stats on Insta, but I‚Äôm definitely not cool enough for the curated fitness reel life. The meditative state during a good run, the post-race high, and a good coffee or pint after, all part of the running cult I happily subscribe to.

As a self-confessed member of said cult, I feel like you should reciprocate the baring of my soul. What cult are you part of? ü§£



Now that I‚Äôve rambled like I‚Äôm overly caffeinated, (cough cough,) I am, it‚Äôs only fair you tell me about yourself. What‚Äôs your thing? What‚Äôs the hobby or obsession you‚Äôd like me to get into?



Honestly, I just enjoy getting to know people. The deep stuff, the dumb stuff, all the in-between.



Got a book that‚Äôll hit me in the best way? A running tip that doesn‚Äôt involve buying yet another pair of shoes? Hit me up.",1,1750664663.0,discordfriends,0,1.0,False

They‚Äôre All Things I Haven‚Äôt Lost Yet.,"Quick note: This is my first creepypasta story ever. I've always been interested in storytelling through artworks, horror and creepypasta's, but I thought id try and write a story. 

It started small. A mug. Navy blue, chipped at the handle.

Not from any dramatic drop, just years of knocking against the same sink lip. I‚Äôd had it since college. It used to have a logo for some startup I never worked for, rubbed off now into a vague, ghostly stain. It was the kind of mug you don‚Äôt even think about until it‚Äôs gone.

After the breakup, I didn‚Äôt take much with me. Just the basics: a few boxes, some clothes, whatever I could fit in the backseat without making a second trip. The mug came with me. Not out of sentimentality, I didn‚Äôt feel sentimental. Just habit. You keep what works.

The house was the cheapest rental I could find within an hour of my job. Small, a little too far out into the woods for my taste, but it had a porch and no neighbours in sight. After everything with Claire, that part appealed to me. Silence was easier than explaining anything.

The morning I found the mug on the porch, I figured I must‚Äôve left it there the night before. It had been one of those nights. The kind where sleep never quite sticks, and you sit outside wrapped in a hoodie, watching the dark for no reason. I couldn‚Äôt remember taking it out there, but that didn‚Äôt mean anything. Lately, a lot of things slipped my mind.

What gave me pause was walking into the kitchen afterward and seeing it... my mug. still sitting on the counter. Cold coffee inside. Same chip on the handle. Same fading ghost of a logo.

I walked back to the porch, picked up the other one. It was still warm. Like it had just been poured.

For a long minute I just stood there, one mug in each hand, trying to feel some kind of explanation take shape. They were identical. Not similar. Identical. Same scratches on the base. Same spot where the glaze had bubbled slightly near the lip.

How could this be the exact same mug? I felt confused.

Like a detail in the background of my life had quietly rearranged itself.

I set them both on the counter, I tried to make up some sort of reasoning in my mind but¬† I couldn‚Äôt think of anything. I guess I have a second mug now.

The next morning, my hoodie was folded neatly on the porch railing.

And I hadn‚Äôt taken it off.



I stood there in the doorway, barefoot, blinking into the morning haze. The chill bit through the sleeves. Same dark grey fabric, frayed cuffs, the little tear under the left arm where the seam had split months ago.

The one on the railing was identical. Folded with care, like someone had taken the time to line the edges just right. Not tossed. Not forgotten. Placed.

I ran my hand over the fabric of the one I had on and then picked up the other one. Same faded tag. Same loose thread at the hem. The tear was there too, in the exact same spot.

It was like someone had made a perfect copy of what I was already wearing.

And left it for me to find.

Two of them. Just like the mug.

Something settled in my chest. Not fear. Just a hard awareness.

I brought the porch hoodie in and laid it next to the first one. I didn‚Äôt know what else to do with it. I stared at them both for a long time, then went and looked at the mug again, still sitting on the kitchen counter next to its twin. Four items. Two duplicates. No explanation.

I tried to come up with a reason. Something logical. A prank, maybe. A break-in I somehow slept through. But who would go to the trouble of copying a mug or folding a hoodie with that kind of care?

And how would they get everything exactly right?

Maybe I was losing it. Stress, isolation, it does things to people. I hadn‚Äôt talked to anyone in days. Maybe my mind was filling the silence with noise.

But this wasn‚Äôt noise. These were objects. Physical. Solid. And too perfect to ignore.

That evening, I took a small spiral notebook out of my jacket. The one I‚Äôd been using for grocery lists and random reminders, and started writing everything down. The mug. The hoodie. Date. Time. Where I found them. Where the originals were when I checked.

Nothing fancy. Just facts.

I didn‚Äôt want to believe something strange was happening.

But I also didn‚Äôt want to forget the order of things just in case there was a pattern.

¬†

By the third morning, I wasn‚Äôt surprised to see something waiting for me.

It was my paperback copy of The King in Yellow, slightly water-warped from a spill a few years back. I‚Äôd been rereading it before bed. The real one was still on my nightstand, with a folded receipt marking page 132.

The copy on the porch was opened to the same page, the receipt in the same place. Same fold. It shouldn‚Äôt have been familiar, but it was.

I took it inside and laid it next to the original. The pages were a little stiffer, maybe newer. But everything else, even the cracked spine, was identical.

That made three duplicates in three days.

By now, I‚Äôd stopped pretending it wasn‚Äôt weird. Still, I didn‚Äôt tell anyone. I didn‚Äôt have anyone to tell, and even if I had, what was I supposed to say? Hey, something‚Äôs leaving copies of my stuff on the porch, and they‚Äôre exactly right, but also somehow... not?

I started checking the porch compulsively every morning. Sometimes twice. There was never anything at night. Or if there was, I never caught it. I even stayed up once, watching from the couch, facing the front door like a hunter. Nothing happened. I fell asleep around 4 a.m.

That morning: my wristwatch. The old one with the cracked face I always meant to replace. Still ticking. Still on my dresser, too. Now I had two of them, both set to the same time, down to the second.

That‚Äôs when I grabbed a fresh page in my notebook, like it mattered. And I started scribbling down everything I owned. Every single thing I could remember. Mugs. Books. Clothes. Electronics. Kitchen junk. The cheap corkscrew. The old backpack. Even that stupid dented flashlight buried in the junk drawer.

I didn‚Äôt even know what I was looking for. Maybe I would find somekind of pattern. But writing it all down made me feel like I had a grip on it, or at least like I was doing something. And when something shows up on the porch, I would go straight back to the list and slashed a red line through it. Noted. Accounted for. Under control.

So far, four items. Mug. Hoodie. Book. Watch.

The notebook was already half-filled by the end of the day.

I didn‚Äôt want to admit how much it comforted me. the list.

¬†

Around the fifth day, I started reaching for explanations.

Claire crossed my mind.

It didn‚Äôt make much sense. She didn‚Äôt have a key, had never been to this house, and I never told her where I was going. But maybe she figured it out. I‚Äôd posted some things after the breakup. Nothing specific, but enough to trace if you really wanted to.

It didn‚Äôt feel like her. We hadn‚Äôt ended badly, just quietly. But maybe she needed something unresolved.



That morning, the porch gift was my lighter. Same scratch by the thumbwheel, same half-worn label.

I checked my coat. Mine was still there, warm from the sun.

I stared at the new one for a while. Then I messaged her: Hey. If this is you, I need you to stop. It‚Äôs messing with my head.

She replied about an hour later: ‚ÄúWhat? I‚Äôm in the Netherlands. Visiting my parents. I haven‚Äôt been in the country since last week. Are you okay?‚Äù

STUPID, I knew this, she planned this trip long before we even split up.

I didn‚Äôt answer.

I just locked my phone, set it face down, and stared at the lighter.

I sat there for a while, holding both lighters in my hands, flipping the wheels just enough to spark without igniting.

Then I broke it. Smashed it into the counter until the plastic split. It didn‚Äôt help. But it felt like pushing back.

The next morning, my kitchen towel was folded on the porch step.

The original was still hanging from the oven handle.

I burnt down the copy.



It built up slowly.

At first, the duplicates were strange, but manageable. One a day, always familiar, always intact. Mugs. Books. Socks. Pens. Everything I used, everything I touched, eventually showed up on the porch. One by one. No fanfare. No tracks. Just‚Ä¶ there.

So I started breaking them.

Just the porch copies. I told myself it was harmless. They weren‚Äôt mine, not really. Just extras. Hollow things. And I still had the originals. It started with smashing items against the concrete. Tearing the sleeves off shirts. I kept a small hammer near the door after a while. Morning ritual.

Smash. Sweep. Forget.

Then the originals started vanishing.

I didn‚Äôt notice at first. It was subtle. A book missing from the nightstand. A pair of socks I swore were in the laundry, gone without a trace. A kitchen knife I used the night before, nowhere in the drawer.

And each time, the next porch item was... off.

Not in a big way. Just enough to notice.

A mug was a little taller. The spine of a book was stiffer. A shirt was the right colour, but the fabric felt wrong. Too smooth, too new. The handwriting on a sticky note wasn‚Äôt quite mine.

It wasn‚Äôt replacing the broken copies with more copies.

It was replacing my things. Taking the originals.

And now the new ones, the ones it left behind, were getting worse at pretending.

¬†

There had to be someone.

That was the only explanation that made any kind of sense. Not ghosts. Not some supernatural bullshit. A person. Someone with too much time, too much access, and a reason to screw with me.

A stalker.

I hated the word. Not because it was over the top, but because it landed too close to something real. Like saying it out loud might give it shape, make it stick. It sounded like something you‚Äôd hear whispered in the middle of a story that never ends well. But what else could it be?

Someone was watching me. Tracking what I owned, what I used, what I touched. They were sneaking in, making perfect copies, then, somehow, replacing the originals. And now they were slipping. Getting sloppy. Making small mistakes. A tag sewn wrong. A different brand of pen ink. A hoodie that made of a different fabric.

I started going over possibilities. A neighbour? Unlikely. ¬†there weren‚Äôt any within walking distance. A former coworker? A stranger I‚Äôd pissed off somehow?

I couldn‚Äôt think of anyone who‚Äôd hate me enough to pull this off. But then again, maybe it wasn‚Äôt about hate. Maybe it was obsession.

That thought chilled me more than I expected.

Because if it was a stalker, then that meant someone had been in my house. More than once. Dozens of times, probably. Moving quietly. Watching me sleep. Learning my habits. Slipping in and out without ever making a sound. And leaving me these‚Ä¶ gifts.

Not notes. Not warnings. Just things I already owned, placed gently on the porch, as if I‚Äôd forget they hadn‚Äôt always been there.



I wanted to catch them.

Not confront them. I‚Äôm not an idiot. Just see them. Confirm they existed. That it wasn‚Äôt all in my head. That someone, somewhere, was walking up to my porch in the dead of night with a duplicate mug or sock or hoodie like it was a delivery route.

So I stayed up.

Just me, a hoodie, a thermos of bitter coffee, and a folding chair angled toward the steps. Porch light off. Eyes open.

The air was still and damp. Crickets, mostly. Every now and then a breeze would drag itself through the trees, but otherwise it was quiet in that deep, hollow way that only happens out here. The kind of quiet that makes your own heartbeat feel too loud.

I sat there for hours.

The night stretched on, and my thoughts slowed the way they always do when it‚Äôs late and your body wants to sleep but your mind refuses to quit. I started thinking about the list in my jacket. the items I hadn‚Äôt crossed off yet. My boots. My keys. The picture of me and my brother from that one summer road trip. No matter how hard I thought about it I could not figure out a pattern, or who this stalker could be.

A little after three, I heard it.

Knocking.

Not from the porch.

From inside the house.

Three slow, deliberate knocks. Not on the front door, but somewhere deeper. Not loud, but clear. Like someone wanted me to hear, but not react too fast.

I stood up. The porch boards creaked under my weight. I turned toward the front door, then glanced over my shoulder. Nothing behind me, no shadows moving in the yard.

The knocking came again. This time from the kitchen.

I stepped inside.

Nothing. Everything still. No windows open, no breeze, no sign of forced entry. I walked into the kitchen, barefoot on cold tile. That eerie half-light before dawn was just beginning to creep into the corners of the room.

And there, sitting neatly on the kitchen counter, was the notebook.

The one I kept in my jacket.

Open to a new page.

A page I hadn‚Äôt written yet.

Tomorrow‚Äôs date was at the top. Under it: one line.

Item: House key.



I left that morning.

Didn‚Äôt pack much. just some clothes, my wallet, the notebook, my keys. I threw it all into my backpack and drove. I did not want to look around the house. I did not feel safe. I had no plan, no direction at first, just distance. I couldn‚Äôt stay in that house another night. Not after the knocking. Not after seeing my own handwriting predicting what hadn‚Äôt happened yet.

It didn‚Äôt feel like a place I lived in anymore.

It felt like a place something else had been living through me.

I found a cheap motel two towns over. a squat, roadside place with the kind of parking lot lit by buzzing floodlights and half-dead bugs in every overhead fixture. I paid for three nights in cash and gave a fake name, even though I knew how pointless that was.

Room 12. Ground floor. Small bathroom, two lamps that didn‚Äôt match, and a TV bolted to the dresser. The bedspread had a cigarette burn shaped like a question mark.

It was exactly what I needed.

For a few hours, I felt safe. Not good, just unobserved. I kept the curtains closed. Left the lights on. Tried not to check the duplicate list, but I did anyway.

Nothing new had been crossed off.

When I finally started to relax, I ordered takeout, took a long shower, and tried to fall asleep with the TV playing some muted wildlife documentary. It didn‚Äôt have Netflix.

It was just after seven. I left the room to grab a coffee from the lobby, barely awake.

I opened the door and stopped.

There it was, right in front of me on the carpet.

My house key.

Not just similar. Mine. Same worn-down grooves. Same frayed leather keychain with the little brass coin I‚Äôd glued on years ago from that trip I barely remembered.

I stood there for a second, like maybe I‚Äôd dropped it and forgotten. But that didn‚Äôt make sense.

I went back inside, opened my backpack.

The key was still in the front pocket. Exactly where it was supposed to be.

Now there were two.

¬†

I gave up on running.

The motel hadn‚Äôt helped. If anything, it had made things worse. made It clearer that this wasn‚Äôt about the house. Or the town. Or the distance I tried to put between myself and whatever this was.

It followed.

Toothbrush. Socks. Wallet. Even my notebook, though I never remembered taking it out of my coat. Everything kept showing up, carefully arranged around the motel room. Delivered. Presented.

I hadn‚Äôt lost any of them, not yet. That was the rule. They only arrived before they disappeared.

By the fifth morning, I checked out and drove home.

I didn‚Äôt unpack. Didn‚Äôt eat. I walked through each room like a tenant moving back into someone else‚Äôs life. Things felt the same, but wrong in the way shadows feel wrong when they fall in the wrong direction.

I didn‚Äôt go to bed. Instead, I lay down on the couch and pulled the old throw blanket over me. Not because I was tired. I wasn‚Äôt. but because I couldn‚Äôt imagine another night pretending to sleep in that room with the closet door that always seemed half-open.

The living room window looked out toward the side of the house. Just trees and darkness beyond. I left the blinds cracked, the room dim. Some part of me still thought I‚Äôd hear footsteps again. Maybe the knocking. Maybe worse.

I must‚Äôve drifted off, because I woke up to a feeling. not a sound. A pressure in the air. Like the house was holding its breath.

I turned toward the window.

There was a face staring in.

Close. Inches from the glass.

It was mine.

Not a trick of light. Not a reflection. My face, outside in the dark, watching me. Same jawline. Same tired eyes. Same scar above the left brow, a bike accident when I was nine.

It didn‚Äôt blink. I did. And it didn‚Äôt.

For one suspended moment, we locked eyes.

Then it moved. Quick and quiet, sliding out of view to the left. Toward the front porch.

I scrambled to my feet, heart punching the inside of my chest. I didn‚Äôt even grab anything. I just went to the front door and yanked it open.

The porch was empty.

Except for one thing.

Wrapped in coarse fabric. Laid down carefully, like a final gift.

¬†

I didn‚Äôt touch it right away.

It was wrapped in coarse grey fabric, folded precisely, resting at the center of the porch like it had been waiting for me. Laying there like it had always belonged there.

I knelt and peeled the fabric back.

A plaque. Stone, or something close. Dark, pitted, cold to the touch. Too heavy to lift easily. I had to brace my legs, adjust my grip. The air felt thinner while I held it.

My name was carved into the surface.

Jacob Davidson.

Below that: two dates.

The first was my birthday.

The second was next weeks date. The 21st of October.

I set it down carefully.

Didn‚Äôt bring it inside.

I just stood there for a long time, watching the light shift across the surface of the stone.

Since then, nothing else has shown up. No more mugs, no more clothes, no more pieces of me.

That was the last item I ever received.

Hey everyone,
I've been reading tarot for over 10 years now, and it's truly been a profound journey. Beyond just readings, I also practice protection magic, focusing on healing and safeguarding people from harm. It's a deep passion, and I pour my heart and soul into every interaction.

Lately, I've been thinking about creating video tarot readings where I not only show the cards dealt, but also explain the vibes and intuitions I get from them in a really personal, conversational way. It's important to me that these aren't just quick interpretations; I want to offer genuine connection and insight, leveraging all my years of experience.

I've been thinking about charging a very small fee for these video readings ‚Äì something like the cost of a coffee or a bus ticket, just enough to acknowledge the time and energy I'm putting into them, and maybe help me keep this little passion project going. I'm not looking to get rich, just to make it sustainable.

But here's where I'm hoping to get some wisdom from you all: is it fair to charge such a small amount for this type of offering? And where could I start making this, which platform is the best to do so?

On one hand, I feel like the value of a heartfelt, personalized video reading, backed by years of practice and my work with protection magic, goes beyond a few dollars. On the other, I want to be accessible to everyone and don't want to price anyone out. I also wonder if charging too little undervalues the art of tarot itself.

What are your thoughts on this? For those of you who offer readings, how do you approach pricing, especially for video content? Any advice or personal experiences would be so incredibly helpful. I'm really keen to hear different perspectives!

Thanks so much in advance for your insights and support. Sending good vibes to all! ‚ú®

1liagqy,https://www.reddit.com/r/HowToLoseWeightFST/comments/1liagqy/why_i_tried_yet_another_detox_tea/,Why I tried yet another detox tea,"Quarantine left me with a nightly routine of Netflix plus snacks, and my gut paid the price. Constant puffiness, sluggish mornings, and cravings that never quit. I wasn‚Äôt chasing a miracle cleanse, just a gentler stomach and maybe a bit of renewed energy. After sifting through threads, the most balanced feedback I found was on **Lulutox detox tea**. Most reviewers said it helped with bloating and focus without forcing dramatic bathroom runs, so I took the plunge.

**Ingredient reality check**

The first thing I did was read every label I could find. **Lulutox tea ingredients** list 13 recognizable plants:

* Matcha, oolong, and sencha green tea for antioxidants
* Yerba mate and guarana for light caffeine
* Dandelion leaf and milk thistle for liver and digestion support
* Nettle leaf, lemongrass, ginseng, and goji berries for inflammation and immune balance
* Stevia leaf for a touch of sweetness

Everything is vegan, gluten-free, and soy-free, with about 18 mg of caffeine per cup, softer than coffee but enough to wake me up.

**The first two weeks**

Cup one tasted earthy with a hint of peach. No bitterness, no sugar cravings afterward. By day four the tight evening bloat eased up. I could sit through work calls without discreetly unbuttoning my jeans. Sleep also felt deeper, which I didn‚Äôt expect from swapping a snack for tea.

**Week three to five: subtle but steady changes**

* **Flatter stomach,** my waistline looked smoother in workout leggings.
* **Steady energy,** less reliance on afternoon espresso, and brain fog lifted.
* Reduced nibbling after dinner; the tea seemed to blunt late-night cravings. On the scale I was down 3.2 lbs, but the bigger win was feeling lighter, not just lighter *weight-wise*.

**Will you live in the bathroom?**

Fair question. I read plenty of horror stories about detox blends that double as laxatives. This one was nothing like that. Digestion became more regular, but I never felt cramps or urgency. Hydration matters, though if you don‚Äôt chase herbal tea with water, expect mild dryness.

For anyone tallying **Lulutox tea side effects**, mine were zero. If you have underlying conditions, ask your doctor. From my experience, the blend is as gentle as advertised.

**Where to buy without getting scammed**

Fake versions are creeping onto third-party marketplaces. I ordered from the [**official Lulutox page**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) during a 70 percent promo and got my shipment in five days. If that site ever glitches, this [**alternate link**](https://www.fasttrack36.com/MM8QQX91/2JD9JH6F/?uid=34821&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/HowToLoseWeightFST) points to the same deal and ingredient list.

**Bottom line**

Does **Lulutox detox tea work**? For dramatic, overnight fat loss, no. For realistic goals like easing bloat, smoothing digestion, and giving a mild energy lift, yes, absolutely. The key was consistency: one cup nightly, no skipped days. Six weeks later I‚Äôm keeping the ritual because it‚Äôs easy, tasty, and my gut feels ‚Äúquiet‚Äù for the first time in months.

If you‚Äôre hunting for a balanced **Lulutox detox tea review** with minimal marketing fluff, that‚Äôs mine. Results were small but meaningful, side effects nonexistent, and the ingredient lineup passes my personal quality check.

1liaf0w,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1liaf0w/portalfilter_jumps_out_delonghi_dedica_885_varia/,Portalfilter jumps Out [DeLonghi Dedica 885 & Varia VS3],"I have owned a DeLonghi Dedica EC885 for about 1 year and 6 months and use it in combination with a Varia VS3 Gen1 grinder (grind mostly between 2.5 and 4.5) and common puck-prep tools (Normcore Spring Tamper, WDT, Leveler). 
My goal is to extract an espresso with a brew ratio of 1:2 in about 30 seconds.

Recently, however, the following problem has arisen: as soon as I set the grind so fine that I could achieve this ratio in the desired time, the portafilter slips and jumps out of the brew group during extraction. With a coarser grind, the coffee runs through without any problems, but too quickly.

I have carefully cleaned the brew group several times and also replaced the seal a few weeks ago. I also descaled the machine. This didn't really improve the problem. Even with a slightly faster brew, the portafilter slips easily in the holder (but doesnt jump Out). 

I use 16g portafilters (not the ones supplied by DeLonghi). However, I only use 14g because of an additional puck screen. 


My question: Could this be a problem/defect with the pump? 
I have already seen videos with the portafilter I bought where 1:2 was possible in 30 seconds with the dedica without any problems. 
The Problem didnt occur at the beginning but my extractions where Always a little too fast. 

Thank you :)

Six years of loving Julian, and in three days, I‚Äôd finally be Mrs. Grayson. I traced my fingers over the intricate lace design I‚Äôd spent months perfecting‚Äîmy masterpiece as both a bride and a designer. My phone shattered the peaceful moment, vibrating violently against the nightstand. Cherry, my assistant at Ashworth Bespoke, rarely called this early. ‚ÄúHazel, I‚Äôm so sorry to disturb you,‚Äù she said, her voice tight with tension. ‚ÄúJulian just came by the studio and took the wedding dress.‚Äù I sat up straight, confusion clouding my mind. ‚ÄúWhat? Why would he do that?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. He just said it was urgent and that you knew about it.‚Äù Cherry‚Äôs voice quivered. ‚ÄúI tried calling you first, but he insisted it was fine.‚Äù A cold sensation crept up my spine. Julian knew the tradition‚Äîthe groom shouldn‚Äôt see the dress before the wedding. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs okay, Cherry. I‚Äôll handle it.‚Äù I immediately dialed Julian‚Äôs number, my heart pounding against my ribs. ‚ÄúJulian, where are you? Cherry said you took my wedding dress.‚Äù The silence on the other end stretched painfully before he finally spoke. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm at Memorial Hospital.‚Äù ‚ÄúHospital? Are you okay?‚Äù Panic surged through me. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, but‚Ä¶ Hazel, we need to talk.‚Äù Something in his voice made my stomach twist. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs going on?‚Äù ‚ÄúThe wedding‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs canceled.‚Äù The words hit me like a physical blow. I gripped the edge of my bed, suddenly dizzy. ‚ÄúWhat are you talking about?‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Ivy. She‚Äôs been diagnosed with terminal cancer. Stage four. The doctors say she has three months at most.‚Äù Ivy. My half-sister. The daughter of the woman who had destroyed my mother‚Äôs life. ‚ÄúWhat does that have to do with our wedding?‚Äù I whispered, already dreading the answer. ‚ÄúHer dying wish‚Ä¶ she wants to marry me, Hazel.‚Äù His voice cracked. ‚ÄúHow can I deny a dying woman her last wish?‚Äù The room seemed to spin around me. Six years together, countless blood donations to help Julian with his rare blood disease, and he was throwing it all away for Ivy? ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre canceling our wedding to marry my stepsister?‚Äù I could barely force the words out. ‚ÄúHalf-sister,‚Äù he corrected gently. ‚ÄúAnd yes. I‚Äôm sorry, Hazel. I never meant to hurt you.‚Äù Memories flooded back‚ÄîIvy‚Äôs mother, Eleanor, seducing my father while my mother was pregnant with me. My father abandoning us, my mother spiraling into depression until she took her own life. Ivy and Eleanor moving into our family home while I was relegated to the servants‚Äô quarters. My father using my mother‚Äôs family business as a dowry to win Eleanor‚Äôs hand. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt just about a wedding, Julian. You know what she and her mother did to my family.‚Äù ‚ÄúPeople change, Hazel. She‚Äôs dying.‚Äù His voice hardened. ‚ÄúLook, I know this is difficult. I‚Äôm prepared to compensate you‚Äîfifty percent of Grayson Enterprises.‚Äù ‚ÄúCompensate me?‚Äù I choked out. ‚ÄúLike I‚Äôm a business transaction?‚Äù ‚ÄúBe reasonable. Think about what that stake could do for your fashion line.‚Äù Something snapped inside me. The tears that had been threatening to fall dried up, replaced by a cold, clear fury. ‚ÄúWhere is my wedding dress now?‚Äù I asked, my voice surprisingly steady. ‚ÄúAt Ivy‚Äôs. She‚Äôs having it altered.‚Äù Of course she was. Ivy had spent our entire childhood taking everything that was mine‚Äîmy father‚Äôs love, my inheritance, my home. Now she was taking my fianc√© and wearing my handcrafted wedding dress while doing it. ‚ÄúI see.‚Äù I hung up without another word. I sat motionless, staring at the wall. The dress I‚Äôd poured my heart into, the wedding I‚Äôd dreamed of since I was a little girl, the man I thought loved me‚Äîall snatched away in an instant. My phone buzzed again. My best friend Victoria. ‚ÄúHave you heard?‚Äù she demanded without preamble. ‚ÄúJust now.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat absolute piece of garbage! And Ivy‚Äîusing cancer as an excuse to steal your man? Classic her.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe offered me half his company as compensation,‚Äù I said numbly. ‚ÄúHalf? That cheap bastard should give you the whole damn thing! After all you‚Äôve done for him?‚Äù Victoria‚Äôs outrage ignited something in me. She was right. For six years, I‚Äôd been Julian‚Äôs blood donor, literally keeping him alive with my rare Rh-negative blood type‚Äî‚Äùpanda blood,‚Äù as the doctors called it. I‚Äôd nursed him through his illness, built my career around our future together, and this was how he repaid me? I thought of my mother, how she‚Äôd withered away after my father‚Äôs betrayal. How Eleanor had paraded around in my mother‚Äôs jewelry, slept in my mother‚Äôs bed, while my mother faded into a shell of herself. I would not become my mother. ‚ÄúHazel? Are you still there?‚Äù Victoria‚Äôs concerned voice pulled me back. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm calling him back,‚Äù I said decisively. ‚ÄúGood! Tell him exactly where he can shove his fifty percent!‚Äù After hanging up, I dialed Julian‚Äôs number again. He answered on the first ring. ‚ÄúHazel, I‚Äôm glad you called. I know this is a lot to process‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúJulian,‚Äù I cut him off, my voice cool and steady. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve considered your offer.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou have?‚Äù Hope tinged his voice. He‚Äôd expected me to fall apart, to beg and plead. ‚ÄúYes. It‚Äôs unacceptable.‚Äù ‚ÄúHazel, please be reasonable‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúGive me the entire company, and I‚Äôll give up the position of bride.‚Äù The words flowed with surprising ease. ‚ÄúIf you agree, come back tonight, and we‚Äôll sign the agreement.‚Äù Silence stretched between us. I could almost see his shocked expression. ‚ÄúThe‚Ä¶ entire company? Hazel, that‚Äôs my family legacy.‚Äù ‚ÄúAnd marrying me was supposed to be your future. You‚Äôve made your choice. Now I‚Äôm making mine.‚Äù I paused. ‚ÄúTonight, Julian. Either come with ownership papers, or don‚Äôt come at all.‚Äù I ended the call before he could respond, surprising myself with my newfound steel. The devastated bride was gone. In her place stood a woman who refused to be discarded without extracting a proper price. The ball was in his court now. 2- The Fianc√©‚Äôs Final Insult I spent the day in a haze of anger, meticulously packing Julian‚Äôs things into boxes. Six years of shared life reduced to cardboard containers lined up by the door. His favorite coffee mug. Those hideous plaid pajamas I‚Äôd always threatened to burn. The silver cufflinks I‚Äôd given him for our first anniversary. With each item, I unearthed memories I was determined to bury. My hands worked mechanically while my mind kept replaying Julian‚Äôs betrayal over and over. ‚ÄúYour wedding dress looks better on Ivy anyway,‚Äù I muttered sarcastically, tossing his prized golf trophy into a box with less care than it deserved. The satisfying crack it made as it hit his college diploma frame brought me a fleeting moment of joy. Just before seven, the doorbell rang. I smoothed down my black dress‚Äîdeliberately chosen to look like I was attending a funeral‚Äîand opened the door. Julian stood there looking haggard, but it was the woman behind him who caught my attention. Mrs. Landon, Julian‚Äôs mother, her lips pursed in disapproval as she surveyed me. ‚ÄúHazel,‚Äù Julian said, his expression a practiced mix of guilt and resolve. ‚ÄúYou remember my mother.‚Äù ‚ÄúMrs. Landon,‚Äù I nodded coolly, stepping aside to let them in. ‚ÄúI thought we‚Äôd moved past the formality, dear,‚Äù she said with a thin smile. ‚ÄúYou used to call me Mom.‚Äù ‚ÄúThat was before your son decided to marry my sister instead of me,‚Äù I replied sweetly. ‚ÄúPlease, come in. The boxes by the door are Julian‚Äôs things.‚Äù Julian winced. ‚ÄúHazel, I know this is difficult‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúIs that the agreement?‚Äù I cut him off, pointing to the folder in his hand. He nodded, following me to the dining table. His mother trailed behind, her heels clicking disapprovingly on my hardwood floors. ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre doing this, Hazel,‚Äù Mrs. Landon said as we sat down. ‚ÄúAfter everything our family has done for you. Julian gave you your start in fashion, introduced you to all the right people‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúMother, please,‚Äù Julian interrupted, but I was already leaning forward. ‚ÄúWhat your family did for me?‚Äù I asked, my voice dangerously soft. ‚ÄúYou mean besides Julian using my rare blood type to keep himself alive for the past six years? Or perhaps you‚Äôre referring to how he‚Äôs currently wearing the wedding tux I designed while planning to marry my sister?‚Äù Mrs. Landon‚Äôs face flushed. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre being unreasonable. Ivy is dying‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúSo you keep telling me.‚Äù I turned to Julian. ‚ÄúThe agreement?‚Äù Julian slid the folder across the table. I opened it, scanning the documents that transferred ownership of A&G Bespoke entirely to me. Our jointly founded fashion company would now be mine alone. It felt hollow‚Äîa business victory that couldn‚Äôt patch the hole in my heart. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs all there,‚Äù Julian said. ‚ÄúAs you demanded.‚Äù ‚ÄúNot quite everything,‚Äù I said, placing the documents down. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs the matter of my wedding dress.‚Äù Julian blinked. ‚ÄúWhat about it?‚Äù ‚ÄúI want one million for it.‚Äù Mrs. Landon gasped. ‚ÄúOne million dollars? For a dress? Have you lost your mind?‚Äù I kept my eyes fixed on Julian. ‚ÄúThat dress took me six months to design and create. Italian silk, French lace, hand-sewn crystals. It‚Äôs an Ashworth original worth every penny.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is extortion,‚Äù Mrs. Landon hissed. Julian held up his hand to silence his mother. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine. I‚Äôll transfer the money.‚Äù ‚ÄúJulian!‚Äù his mother protested. ‚ÄúNo, Mother. She‚Äôs right.‚Äù He pulled out his phone, making the transfer with a few taps. My phone dinged with the notification, and I checked it before continuing. ‚ÄúNow,‚Äù I said, leaning back in my chair, ‚ÄúI believe we‚Äôre done here.‚Äù Julian shifted uncomfortably. ‚ÄúActually, there‚Äôs one more thing.‚Äù Of course there was. I raised an eyebrow, waiting. ‚ÄúIvy‚Ä¶ she was hoping you might let her have the wedding jewelry set as well. The one you had custom-made to match the dress.‚Äù I stared at him in disbelief. The jewelry set‚Äîa diamond and sapphire necklace, earrings, and bracelet I‚Äôd designed myself. The sapphires matched my eyes exactly. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs dying, Hazel,‚Äù Julian added quietly. ‚ÄúIt would mean the world to her.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat exactly does she want my jewelry for when she‚Äôs going to be dead in three months?‚Äù I asked coldly. Mrs. Landon gasped again. ‚ÄúHow dare you speak about your sister that way!‚Äù ‚ÄúHalf-sister,‚Äù I corrected, just as Julian had done to me on the phone. ‚ÄúAnd she‚Äôs made my life hell since we were children.‚Äù Julian leaned forward, his eyes pleading. ‚ÄúHazel, I know things haven‚Äôt been easy between you two, but people can change. Ivy has changed. The illness has made her reflect on her life.‚Äù I almost laughed at his naivety. ‚ÄúHas it? Or is she just continuing her lifelong hobby of taking what‚Äôs mine?‚Äù ‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù Julian whispered. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll make it up to you. After‚Ä¶ after Ivy passes, we could still have our future together. An even grander wedding, I promise.‚Äù The silence that followed was deafening. I stared at him, unable to process what I‚Äôd just heard. ‚ÄúYou think,‚Äù I finally said, each word sharp as glass, ‚Äúthat after you marry my sister in my wedding dress, I‚Äôll just wait patiently for her to die so we can pick up where we left off?‚Äù Julian had the decency to look ashamed, but he pressed on. ‚ÄúI still love you, Hazel. This doesn‚Äôt change that. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs the right thing to do for someone who‚Äôs suffering.‚Äù I felt something break inside me‚Äîthe last thread of affection I‚Äôd been clinging to. This wasn‚Äôt just betrayal; it was delusion of the highest order. ‚ÄúJulian,‚Äù I said, my voice surprisingly steady, ‚Äúyou are truly the most pathetic man I‚Äôve ever known.‚Äù ‚ÄúNow see here‚Äî‚Äù Mrs. Landon began, but I silenced her with a look. ‚ÄúFine,‚Äù I said, turning back to Julian. ‚ÄúAnother million for the jewelry set.‚Äù ‚ÄúTwo million dollars for jewelry and a dress?‚Äù Mrs. Landon sputtered. ‚ÄúTwo million dollars is a small price to pay for stealing someone‚Äôs fianc√© and wedding,‚Äù I countered. Julian nodded, making the second transfer without argument. My phone pinged again. I signed the company transfer agreement, pushing it back across the table. ‚ÄúYou pay me the money, and tomorrow, I will personally deliver the full set of jewelry to the hospital, and visit my good sister while I‚Äôm at it.‚Äù A flash of uncertainty crossed Julian‚Äôs face. He knew my relationship with Ivy well enough to be concerned about what such a visit might entail. ‚ÄúHazel, maybe I should‚Äî‚Äù ‚ÄúNo,‚Äù I cut him off firmly. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve made your choice, Julian. Now live with it.‚Äù I stood up, signaling the end of our meeting. ‚ÄúTake your boxes on the way out. I won‚Äôt be home tomorrow to let the movers in.‚Äù Mrs. Landon looked like she wanted to say more, but Julian took her arm, guiding her toward the door. ‚ÄúThank you, Hazel,‚Äù he said quietly. ‚ÄúI know this isn‚Äôt easy.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt respond, just watched as he awkwardly gathered the first load of boxes. At the door, he paused, looking back at me with those eyes I once thought were sincere. ‚ÄúI really do love you,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI always will.‚Äù I met his gaze steadily. ‚ÄúGoodbye, Julian.‚Äù After the door closed behind them, I sank onto the couch, staring at my phone. Two million dollars. A small fortune that did nothing to fill the void his betrayal had left. Tomorrow, I would see Ivy. My half-sister who had spent her life trying to take everything from me. Who was now supposedly dying, yet still found the energy to steal my wedding, my fianc√©, and now my jewelry. I picked up the small velvet box containing the sapphire set, opening it to see the stones gleaming in the lamplight. They were exquisite‚Äîand perfect for what I had planned. I smiled for the first time that day. If Ivy wanted my jewelry so badly, I would be delighted to give it to her personally. And unlike Julian‚Äôs ridiculous fantasy, I had no intention of waiting around for her to die before reclaiming my life. Tomorrow, the real reckoning would begin. 3- A Wedding Stolen, A Fury Unleashed The satisfying slam of the door behind Julian and his mother wasn‚Äôt nearly enough. The moment they stepped outside, I sank to the floor, my body trembling with rage. Six years. Six years I had given Julian Grayson, and this was how he repaid me. My dog, Bentley, a gentle golden retriever who usually avoided conflict, sensed my distress and padded over. His warm body pressed against mine, offering silent comfort. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre the only male I can trust,‚Äù I whispered, burying my face in his soft fur.¬†",1,1750663772.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,1,1.0,False

Here's what I learned when I stopped reading and started doing:

* Names are literally magic words. Started using people's names way more than felt natural. ""Thanks for the coffee, Sarah"" instead of just ""thanks."" ""Good point, Mike"" instead of ""good point."" Felt weird at first but people light up when they hear their own name. Their whole face changes.
* Became genuinely curious about random stuff. Instead of pretending to care about someone's weekend hiking trip, I'd ask follow-up questions until I found something actually interesting. ""What's the hardest part about the trail?"" ""Do you see wildlife?"" ""How do you know which gear to bring?"" Turns out most topics are fascinating if you dig past surface level.
* Stopped trying to be the smartest person in the room. Used to jump in with corrections or try to one-up people's stories. Started asking ""How did you figure that out?"" or ""What made you think of that approach?"" instead. People love explaining their thought process and you actually learn stuff.
* Let people save face when they mess up. Coworker made a mistake in a meeting? Instead of pointing it out, I'd say ""Maybe we should double-check the numbers"" or ""I might be missing something here."" They fix the error without looking stupid. They remember who had their back.
* Actually listened instead of waiting for my turn to talk. Stopped preparing my response while someone else was speaking. Started paying attention to what they were actually saying. Asked questions about their answers. Conversations became way less exhausting because I wasn't constantly having to think what to say next.
* Found common ground with literally everyone. Started looking for shared experiences instead of differences. Turns out the a coworker and I both hate morning meetings. The quiet intern and I both love obscure podcasts. The annoying coworker and I both struggle with work-life balance. Connection beats competition every time.
* Became a hype man for other people's wins. When someone accomplished something, I'd make sure other people knew about it. ""Did you hear Sarah closed that big deal?"" ""Mike's presentation was incredible, did you see it?"" Takes zero effort but people remember who celebrates their success.
* Stopped arguing about stupid stuff. Used to debate everything like my life depended on being right. Now when someone says something I disagree with, I either let it go or say ""I never thought about it that way"" and actually consider their perspective. Relationships improved overnight.
* Started admitting when I was wrong. ""You're right, I messed that up"" became my new superpower. People expect defensiveness, so honesty catches them off guard. They usually respond with understanding instead of judgment.
* Asked for advice instead of giving it. Instead of telling people what they should do, I started asking ""What do you think would work best?"" or ""What's your gut telling you?"" People already know their answers most of the time, they just want someone to listen.
* Made people feel important. Started noticing specific things people did well. ""I really liked how you handled that difficult client"" or ""Your way of explaining complex stuff makes so much sense."" Genuine appreciation, not generic compliments.

People actually seek out my opinion now. Invitations to social stuff increased by like 300%. Family gatherings stopped feeling like interrogations. Also time with friends have been the best.

Being genuinely interested in others is way less work than trying to be interesting yourself. When you focus on making other people feel good, they associate those positive feelings with you.

Most social skills advice tells you to ""just be yourself."" But if ""yourself"" is socially awkward, that's terrible advice. Carnegie's book taught me that social skills are learnable skills, not personality traits you're born with.

Took me 5 years to figure out that people don't care how smart or funny or interesting you are. They care about how you make them feel. Once I started focusing on that, everything else fell into place.

1lia3g5,https://i.redd.it/okm4bh7lmm8f1.jpeg,Gng.. did I mess up with my question here?,"Ok so a bit of context..

Me and this gurl are classmates. And after university, the whole class had gone to a coffee shop (named Double shot) where we all just hung out and played games.
One of those games was truth and dare, and basically what happened was that this gurl asked me the following dare;

""Who are u attracted to in our friend group?""
And I obviously got a bit awkward at first, but then answered this one girl's name. But then the other classmates started telling me that;

""That gurl (whose name I said) is not playing this game, so answer the name of a person who is""

So then I thought about it and just said this gurl's name (The one who asked me the question and the one who this post about)
Now I don't really want to pursue this gurl, she's good and all but she does have a few things that I see as turn offs, but the reason I said her name was because I think she is probably the only one who's attractive to me in our friend group (other than the girl whose name I said previously)

So then fast forward to tonight and me and her were just chatting on Insta, and I just wanted to ask her if my answer made her uncomfortable or not at the cafe

(Because at the caf√© we all just laughed it off and she didn't really say anything about it)
But then she answered with this response...
And I feel.. confused.

Like I was expecting her to go;
""Nah it's all ok""

And I could understand if she maybe thinks I am making things awkward for no reason, but if that was the case, then she could've just said that in a less attacking way?
Like.. clearly from my question you can understand that my intention was to just ask if she was comfortable with what happened or not.. I wasn't trying to flirt with her or to see if she was actually interested..
So I wanna know what is going on with her response like this?

1lia1zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoolNewGadgets/comments/1lia1zg/why_i_stopped_using_my_phone_hotspot_and_tried_a/,Why I stopped using my Phone hotspot and tried a Portable WiFi device instead,"I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be the kind of person who needed a portable mobile WiFi device. My phone plan includes tethering, and I‚Äôve been using my phone hotspot for years when I travel or work from coffee shops. But after a few frustrating moments -from dropped video calls to dead batteries I finally gave in and tested out a dedicated device. That‚Äôs how I ended up using the **MUAMA Ryoko WiFi**.

It‚Äôs marketed as a compact 4G LTE router that works in over 130 countries. It‚Äôs not locked to one provider and is designed to connect multiple devices to secure mobile data, even when your phone signal is weak or unreliable.

Let me walk you through what worked, what didn‚Äôt, and why I think these types of portable routers still matter in 2025.

# The everyday problems that made me rethink my setup

1. **Phone battery drain**: Using my phone as a hotspot drained my battery at lightning speed, especially when I was trying to run Zoom meetings or download big files on my laptop.
2. **Unreliable signal sharing**: In some areas, my phone would show one or two bars, but it couldn‚Äôt share that signal well enough to power a second device reliably.
3. **Public WiFi risks**: I travel a lot, and hotel or airport WiFi is rarely fast, and sometimes not secure. Connecting sensitive work accounts on public networks didn‚Äôt feel great.

That‚Äôs when I decided to try out a portable mobile router for two weeks.

# My experience using MUAMA Ryoko WiFi

The Ryoko device showed up with a pre-installed SIM card and a free trial of 500MB. Setup was super simple, just turn it on, connect to the WiFi name on the screen, and you‚Äôre online.

It worked in my apartment, on a weekend trip outside the city, and even in a few spots where my phone barely had a signal. It definitely felt more stable than my phone hotspot. It handled video streaming and conference calls without hiccups. I even ran a VPN through it and got decent speeds.

I tested it with both its built-in data plan and my own SIM card from a local provider. That‚Äôs one big plus: you‚Äôre not locked into any contract. You can top up their plan or use your own data provider‚Äôs SIM, which makes it way more flexible.

üîó Want to see how the device works? Here‚Äôs a detailed look:  
[**MUAMA Ryoko portable WiFi**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

# Pros that stood out

* **Battery lasts all day**: I got around 8 hours of use per charge.
* **Connect multiple devices**: My laptop, phone, and Kindle were all online at once.
* **Secure connection**: Great for remote work, banking, or any sensitive info.
* **Portable**: Fits in your pocket and works in most countries without needing to switch SIMs.

I also liked having a **backup internet option** when my home WiFi glitched out for half a day. It kept me connected when I needed to finish work.

Travel a lot or work on the go? This might help:  
[**Learn more about Ryoko WiFi here**](https://www.fasttrack01.com/MM8QQX91/WC9TFJH/?uid=4362&source_id=Rddt&sub1=r/CoolNewGadgets)

# Things to know before you buy

* **It‚Äôs not ‚Äúfree internet‚Äù**: You‚Äôll need to pay for data, whether through Ryoko‚Äôs partner plan or a separate SIM card. That said, it can still be cheaper than roaming charges or some airport WiFi.
* **Not made for heavy gaming or streaming 4K**: It‚Äôs fast enough for work, YouTube, Netflix on medium settings, but not ideal for anything super bandwidth-heavy.
* **Some users have complained about unclear pricing**, especially with the ""unlimited"" data options. So read the fine print before signing up \[[1](https://www.reddit.com/r/Internet/comments/1eirz8k/has_anyone_tried_this_ryoko_internet_service/)\].

# Final thoughts

Using a dedicated portable WiFi device like MUAMA Ryoko WiFi has changed how I approach internet access. It‚Äôs not about replacing my home network or mobile plan, it‚Äôs about **having a stable, private, and flexible option** wherever I go. Whether you're a remote worker, frequent traveler, or someone who just wants a backup for emergencies, this little device fills that gap.

Is it for everyone? Maybe not. But for me, it‚Äôs solved some very specific problems that I used to just deal with. And now I wonder why I didn‚Äôt try it sooner.",1,1750662388.0,CoolNewGadgets,0,1.0,False

We‚Äôve been living together since 2022. However every now and then I feel the need to have conversations with 2-3 friends she doesn‚Äôt know. These are just regular conversations, nothing flirty or sexual, and sometimes I‚Äôll meet up with them for a walk or a coffee. It only happens 1‚Äì2 times a year.

The thing is I don‚Äôt tell her about it and she doesn‚Äôt know these friends. It‚Äôs not because I‚Äôm trying to hide anything or cheat. It‚Äôs just that I don‚Äôt want to make a big deal out of a simple conversation or an afternoon walk.

Part of the reason is that when I was younger as a kid and a teenager I didn‚Äôt have friends outside of school. Even then I never met up with classmates after classes. All I focused on was getting a good education. Now as an adult I feel like I want to make up for those lost years and learn how to openly talk with people and build connections I didn‚Äôt have before.

I met these friends before I started dating my girlfriend, but she doesn‚Äôt know them because she came into my life later. Another reason I only talk with them on my own is that my girlfriend is much more communicative and confident than I am. I have a feeling that if she met these friends she would dominate the conversations and connections, and I wouldn‚Äôt have the space to just be myself.

Now I‚Äôm starting to wonder if this is okay. Will she feel hurt or betrayed if she finds out? Should I tell her about these friends and meetings? What would you do in this situation?",3,1750662299.0,AITAH,7,1.0,False

Mondays... We've All Been There! üò¥  
Ah, Monday. That familiar feeling of the weekend slipping away and the weight of the week looming. We get it! It's okay to feel a little draggy after a good weekend.  
But here's the thing: you've got this! üí™ You just spent a couple of days doing things you love, recharging your batteries, and filling your cup. Tap into that positive energy!  
Think of it like this: the weekend was like a supercharged battery pack for your soul. Now, let's use that power to tackle the week! üöÄ  
Here are a few tips to get you started:  
\* Start small: Don't try to conquer the whole week at once. Break down your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.  
\* Reward yourself: Plan a small reward for getting through the day. It could be anything from a cup of coffee to a few minutes of meditation.  
\* Remember your weekend wins: Take a moment to reflect on the positive experiences you had over the weekend. Let those good vibes fuel your Monday.

The post was a woman who was self-diagnosed with hypo and was sharing tips on how she fixed it.

She wrote: ""People are walking around getting diagnosed, or self-diagnosing hypothyroidism / Hashimotos and are believing that it is a lifelong condition

‚Ä¢ have a magnesium supplementation regimen
‚Ä¢ eat the same sized meals at the same time daily
‚Ä¢ meditate and have disciplined spiritual practice
‚Ä¢ utilize wild yam supplements to stimulate progesterone production
‚Ä¢ increase my raw fiber intake to detox estrogen
‚Ä¢ drink enough water (2-4liters per day)
‚Ä¢ cut down on dairy exponentially or completely
‚Ä¢ increase potassium intake
‚Ä¢ get a shower filter to bathe in healthier water
‚Ä¢ fix my relationship with money (huge for minimizing excess stress)
‚Ä¢ eat more fish and less red meat
‚Ä¢ utilize rhodiola rosea to keep cortisol levels at bay

About 120 bodies slowly filled the conference hall for orientation. 

The A/C was high. 

The vibe was low. 

The coffee was non-existent. 

I did not want to be there. 

But after breaking my previous contract due to violence in the area, this was the nearest facility my recruiter could place me at the time.

As we all sat there listening to people drone on and on and on about rules and regs THEY don‚Äôt even follow‚Ä¶

The compliance officer stepped on stage to deliver her spiel. 

The only thing that kept me going was the fact that she was the last presenter before lunch. So I perked up a bit and feigned‚Ä¶ Life. As much as I could. 

After telling us about dos, don‚Äôts, hotlines, conflicts of interests, etc‚Ä¶

She decided to close with a personal tale. 

She talked about how she had a friend once. 

A nurse friend. 

One that she knew for years and could just pop up at her house unannounced whenever she felt like it. 

One particular day, on one of her unannounced pop ups, she noticed her nurse friend had a small hill of patient labels on her desk. 

When she asked her about them, the friend apparently said they were labels she ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù accumulated over time as it was common practice to place labels on your scrubs for various reasons and just as common to forget they were there by the time you left work. 

The compliance officer reminded her friend that she worked in compliance, the importance of HIPAA laws, urged her to properly dispose of the labels, and change her evil ways. 

She said her friend agreed to dispose of the labels and never bring home any PHI ever again. 

I thought this was the end of the story. 

Until the compliance officer went on to say that as soon as she got to work the next day, she called the compliance officer at her friend‚Äôs facility, reported her friend, sent them photo evidence, all which ultimately ended with the friend losing her job. 

Suddenly, everyone in the conference hall was awake, and in shock. 

The compliance officer was very clear that she was proud about what she did, and that she would do it again.

Now he's the reason I believe in second chances.,"So after my last story about accidentally confessing to the wrong person (hi again, Dan üíö), I realized this wasn't my *only* plot-twist moment. This one‚Äôs from the same chaotic chapter of my life 7 years ago.

Back then, I was a mess. Fresh off the heartbreak with Sam (the best friend I *never* ended up confessing to), confused about love, and commuting 90 minutes each day for uni. One particularly rough day ‚Äî puffy eyes, no makeup, headphones in but no music playing I sat on my usual train, completely zoned out.

And then *he* sat across from me.

Let‚Äôs call him ‚ÄúTrain Guy.‚Äù Clean-cut, holding a novel I‚Äôd just finished the week before, and with the kind of calm presence that makes you *feel* seen. I didn‚Äôt notice him until I accidentally made eye contact mid-yawn. He smiled. I smiled back, awkwardly.

He said, ‚ÄúThat book wrecked me for a week.‚Äù

I replied, ‚ÄúStill recovering.‚Äù

That sparked a 40-minute conversation about books, heartbreak, Taylor Swift (yes, he‚Äôs a fan), and the weird comfort of commuting among strangers.

The next day‚Ä¶ he was on the same train. Same seat. Same smile.

This kept happening. We never exchanged names, never asked for each other‚Äôs numbers just shared that little slice of the world every weekday morning, chatting like old friends who existed *only* in that window of time.

Until one day, he didn‚Äôt show up.

Then a week passed. Two. I figured it was just another beautiful, fleeting thing like a good dream you forget halfway through breakfast.

But fast forward four years I walk into a bookstore (with Dan, no less), and there he is. *Train Guy*. Behind the counter. Still reading. Still smiling.

He looked at me and said, ‚ÄúYou finished that book yet?‚Äù

We laughed like no time had passed.

We didn‚Äôt fall in love. We didn‚Äôt exchange numbers even then. But we *do* exchange book recs on Instagram now. And once a year, we go for coffee and talk about life like we‚Äôre still on that train.

Sometimes, connections don‚Äôt need a label. Sometimes, people just arrive to remind you the world is still soft in places.

**TL;DR**: Met a stranger on a train 7 years ago during one of the hardest times in my life. He helped remind me strangers can still be kind. We‚Äôre still in touch no love story, just a rare one.",4,1750661599.0,stories,2,1.0,False

I've been dealing with chronic stress for a few weeks, and now my under-eye area is twitching randomly. It started with my left eye, but now it's happening with the right one too, sometimes both at once. It's making me look like I'm on the verge of a meltdown, which is getting pretty embarrassing. 

  
I usually mix up my supplements, but right now I'm keeping it simple: a magnesium mix, a mild B-vitamin blend, 1500mg of ginger root, collagen, glycine, and a bit of extra protein on top of my meals. I also take iodine and selenium a few times a week. 

  
I thought the magnesium would sort out the twitching, but no luck so far. Even with a decent 7-8 hours of sleep, the twitching's still going strong after a couple of weeks. 

  
Could it be the coffee? I have two big cups of black coffee a day, which seems pretty normal, so I don't think that's the issue. 

  
I haven't listed exact amounts‚ÄîI just measure in teaspoons and tablespoons, except for the ginger root, which is in pill form. I've got some D-vitamin lying around, but I didn't notice any benefits from it. I eat a lot of bananas, so I'm skipping the C-vitamin for now. 

  
Edit: I've noticed taurine helps with caffeine jitters, but it stopped working after a while. So if anyone suggests taurine, I‚Äôm not sure it's still effective for me. 

  
Edit 2: Forgot to mention I take creatine occasionally. I used to be more consistent, but it gives me this annoying ""face-bloat"" that goes away after a few days of not taking it (I use creatine monohydrate). I usually take about a teaspoon when I do. ",1,1750660959.0,MindFocusFans,0,1.0,False

In all the years Autumn Gray had been married to Damien Caldwell, divorce had never crossed her mind.

And that was because she loved Damien to the moon and back. She loved him so much that she would even die for him.

But now, his first love was back.

‚Ä¶

At the time, Autumn was in the hospital.

The doctor flatly said, ""Ms. Gray, the miscarriage caused lasting damage. Your chances of getting pregnant again in the future are very low. Please be mentally prepared.""

Autumn's mind went blank.

She had been trying to conceive for three grueling years and only got pregnant two months ago.

That afternoon, a car came swerving out of nowhere, causing her to stumble and fall.

The doctor frowned at her. ""Ms. Gray?""

""...Oh, I understand. Thank you, doctor.""

Not one to show weakness in front of others, Autumn blinked away her tears before forcing herself to stand up and leave.

The nurses behind her could be heard gossiping, ""How come her husband didn't show up for something this serious?""

""Don't get me started. She was sobbing so hard after the dilation and curettage surgery while begging her husband on the phone to come to the hospital, but he never came.""

""Geez, he's not even trying to hide how much he doesn't care! Why would anyone still not get a divorce at this point?""

Autumn was now too far to hear the rest of it.

As a matter of fact, Damien hadn't just refused to come. On the phone, he even said, ""So what if the baby's gone? Why would you cry about it? I'm busy. Don't bother me again!""

After that, Autumn called him several more times, and of course, he didn't answer any of her calls.

This cold act of his had been consistent for the past three years.

In all honesty, she had already gotten used to it.

This started three years ago. Autumn had saved Hank Caldwell's life by chance.

Hank, Damien's grandfather, took a liking to her and arranged their marriage. If he hadn't done so, she'd never have had the chance to become Mrs. Caldwell with her social standing.

As such, Damien had been unwilling to marry her from the start.

The only reason she kept trying to reach him that day was that she had hoped that he might at least care for the sake of their unborn child.

But it was now clear that she shouldn't have hoped for anything.

Pulling herself together, Autumn stepped outside to call for a cab home. Just as she pulled out her phone, a new message popped up.

It was from Damien's close friend, Barry Walters. He had sent her a video.

The video showed a massive bouquet of roses. There were at least 999 individual roses, so many that they barely fit in the frame.

The camera then panned to the left, revealing Damien. Beside him stood a woman, Emilia Mason.

Autumn's pupils shrank abruptly, her fists clenching.

Someone in the video shouted in a teasing voice, ""Emilia, after Damien found out you'd be back today, he planned this whole party to welcome you! He really went all out!""

""Aren't you going to give him a hug? You should hurry up and thank him!""

""Forget the hug‚Äîjust go straight for a kiss! It's not like you guys haven't kissed before! I still haven't deleted that three-minute-long passionate kiss video!""

Emilia shook her head. ""That's not really appropriate now‚Ä¶""

She hadn't even finished speaking when Damien pulled her into a gentle embrace. ""Welcome back, Emilia.""

His tone and gesture were so gentle and so natural.

The crowd began squealing in delight. ""See? Damien doesn't mind at all!""

""You guys should kiss!""

At that point, the video abruptly ended because the message had been recalled.

""Sorry, I sent it by mistake.""

The video had been recalled almost instantly. Barry must have thought she hadn't seen it, so there wasn't any further explanation.

Autumn stared at the chat window for a long time, her lips slowly curling into a smirk as she stared.

So, this was the important thing Damien mentioned‚Ä¶

For three whole years, she'd tried to win him over, but Damien never loved her back. What she got instead was watching him reunite with the woman he'd always loved.

She realized then that Damien was even less likely to care about her now.

It was time to wake up from her selfish dream.

Once Autumn got back home, she began packing her things.

Over the years of staying there, she had bought very few things because of her minimalist lifestyle and work. Aside from essentials like clothes and documents, there was nothing else she needed to take.

A single 26-inch suitcase was enough to fit everything, and she was done packing in less than 30 minutes.

Then she waited for Damien to come home.

It wasn't until 2:00 am that the front door finally opened.

As Damien walked past the living room, he locked eyes with Autumn.

Damien wasn't surprised to see her there.

Autumn would always wait up for him just like this whenever he had business dinners and social events.

""You just had surgery. Aren't you going to rest?"" Damien asked indifferently, his tone devoid of concern.

""I was waiting for you.""

From the moment he walked in, Autumn had been staring at his lips.

The corners of his perfectly shaped lips were rather chapped.

On his white shirt collar were faint traces of lipstick. Even his neck had some.

So, he did kiss her‚Äîmaybe even did more than that.

Autumn felt her heart ache.

In their three years of marriage, Damien had only touched her a handful of times. And that only happened whenever he was pressured by his elders to have children.

He never initiated a kiss and would always just jump straight into it. There was never any care or tenderness.

It was torture for Autumn every single time, and when she wanted a hug afterward, he would turn away and head straight to the bathroom.

All she ever got was the cold back of his retreating figure.

Damien spotted the suitcase by her side. Understanding what might have happened, he asked, ""You saw Barry's video?""

""Yeah, I did."" Now that he was close, Autumn could smell the alcohol on him‚Äîand the nauseating scent of perfume.

""Let's get a divor‚Äî""

Before she could finish, Damien cut in casually, ""Since you already know, let's get divorced. You knew what you were getting into from the start. If Emilia hadn't gone abroad, I'd never have married you.""

At this point, there was nothing for Autumn to disagree with. ""Alright.""

""It's pretty late now. Get some rest for today, and you can move out tomorrow‚Äî""

""No need. I've already signed the divorce papers."" Autumn pointed to the coffee table.

Damien had handed her those divorce papers on their wedding night. It wasn't until today that Autumn had finally signed them.

Damien was caught off guard this time.

He knitted his brows, trying to gauge if she was serious.

""I knew you'd be drinking, so I made some soup to help with your hangover. It's in the kitchen,"" Autumn added after a pause.

She made it out of habit. In order to win his heart before this, she had handled every little thing for him.

It hadn't been easy going from someone who could barely cook to a master chef.

Every meal she made for Damien, from grocery shopping to serving, took her hours.

Her fingers bore countless scars from cuts and burns.

Nonetheless, Damien was forever picky. No matter how good the food was, he never said it was, even when his face clearly showed he was enjoying it.

Damien was well aware that a single compliment from him would make her happy for days, yet he simply didn't want her to have that satisfaction.

""I'm going to go now."" They were husband and wife for three years, and now that it was time to part ways, she had nothing left to say to him anymore.

Damien frowned. ""Stay for tonight.""

""No, thanks."" With her suitcase in tow, Autumn turned and walked out the door.

Damien's face darkened‚Äîhe didn't like it when she wouldn't do as told.

The front door closed.

Right then, Barry called. ""Damien, are you home yet? Did you ask Autumn if she saw the video? Sorry about that. I really didn't mean to do it. But even if she did see it, it should be fine, right? You two fight all the time anyway‚Äî""

Damien cut him off, stating, ""She's divorcing me.""

""What? Divorce?"" Barry was stunned, unable to believe his ears. ""Over that video? No way. That's just not possible. If she is really divorcing you, I'll eat my hat!""

""I'm the one who suggested it,"" Damien informed.

Barry went silent for a while.

Damien's request for a divorce had always been pointless. After all, Autumn was known to be clingy and was impossible to get rid of.

""Didn't you ask for a divorce less than a month ago? This topic comes back every month like clockwork.""

Barry then teased, ""Last time I bet she'd come back in half a day‚Äîand I was right. I'm going to bet that she'd be back in one day. If I win again, you owe me another meal!""

Damien glanced at the tightly closed door. He then heard a car engine rumble outside.

Autumn seemed pretty determined that day.

Nevertheless, Damien's sharp eyes showed no concern. ""It won't take that long. She'll be back by morning.""

Chapter 2

Whenever Damien brought up divorce, Autumn would usually leave for a while before coming back without a fuss and trying to please him in whatever way she could.

There had never been an exception in the past.

Of course, this time would be no different.

For her to leave that determinedly that day was probably because she had just lost the baby.

As for the child‚Ä¶

A look of disgust crossed Damien's gaze. Autumn didn't deserve to bear his child. The pregnancy had been purely an accident.

Now that the child was gone, it was for the best.

‚Ä¶

Her compensation from the divorce was five million dollars.

The bank card and the divorce papers had always been placed together.

If Autumn had signed the papers three years ago, she could have had it all without needing to sacrifice anything.

In the three years she'd spent chasing a fantasy, she had not only wasted her time, her energy, and her feelings, but she had also impaired her fertility.

Whatever.

Dwelling on regrets was pointless and would only make her feel hopeless. Life was about moving forward.

Besides, it was better to have money than not at all.

With the bank card in hand, Autumn called for a taxi in the middle of the night, which took her straight to the entrance of Flery Residences.

This was an upscale luxury development where the price started at 30 thousand dollars per square foot.

Each condominium was generously sized, with just two units occupying each floor.

And one was under Autumn's name.

The property used to belong to her uncle, Darius Green. Ever since what happened to Virginia Green, Autumn's mother, he had settled abroad and left the condominium to her.

Autumn had thought she would never need it, but plans never keep up with changes.

Now that she was divorced, having a place to go was pretty nice.

Autumn dragged her suitcase inside Penthouse No. 1, which was located in Building 7.

She had scheduled a cleaning earlier that afternoon. The place was spotless at a single glance, but the nearly 300-square-foot condominium felt empty.

If it had been before, Autumn would have found living alone in such a large space too cold and lonely.

However, after enduring three years of Damien's cold indifference, she feared nothing now, and she even felt a sense of peace she'd never known.

Feeling both relaxed and completely exhausted, Autumn quickly washed up and fell asleep.

At 6:00 am, a familiar alarm woke her up.

The alarm label read, ""Time to make breakfast for my husband.""

Autumn was instantly wide awake.

Damien usually ate breakfast at 8:00 am, but since he was picky and would not eat anything simple, making breakfast would always take her one or two hours to prepare.

Even if he got home late from drinking the night before, Autumn would stay up to care for him, sleep around two or three, and still get up early the next morning.

Sometimes, even after all that effort, Damien wouldn't eat, so the lavish breakfast would just go straight to the trash.

But now, she didn't have to get up early anymore, and she no longer had to worry about her efforts being wasted.

Autumn deleted the alarm, put on her eye mask, and went back to sleep.

Though she believed she'd have a hard time falling back asleep, she succumbed to slumber almost instantly.

‚Ä¶

At 8:00 am, Damien opened his eyes with a pounding headache.

He always got headaches after drinking if he didn't take anything to help with hangovers.

Damien had been too tired last night to drink Autumn's soup, so now he was in agony.

On the nightstand, there was a steaming glass of water.

An unperturbed smirk appeared on his face.

Even though she'd left so decisively, she still came back in the end.

Drinking the warm water helped ease his headache. Then he sent a message to Barry. ""I won the bet.""

Barry was speechless but impressed. ""Can't Autumn stand her ground just once? She spoils you more and more each time!""

Then he began to whine. ""Losing sucks! Damn, the more I think about it, the angrier I get! Damien, hurry up and introduce me to a woman who loves me to death, please! I want to have a taste of what it's like!""

Damien smiled a little. ""Stop acting up.""

Then he tossed the phone aside and got up to shower.

He made his way downstairs, but unlike usual, the busy figure he was used to seeing was nowhere in sight.

""Where is she?"" he said coldly.

Rosetta Braun, his housekeeper who would occasionally cook for him, came out of the kitchen with breakfast. ""Mr. Caldwell, you're up. Breakfast is ready.""

Damien frowned at her. ""It's you?""

""Yeah?""

""Were you the one who placed the water on my nightstand as well?""

Rosetta nodded. ""Last night, Mrs. Caldwell told me she wouldn't be home today and asked me to come early.""

Damien was speechless.

Seeing his dark expression, Rosetta became nervous. ""Mr. Caldwell, maybe you should have some breakfast first‚Ä¶""

Damien stood there for a moment, then reluctantly walked over.

But on the table were only a glass of milk, two slices of toast, a fried egg, and some cheese.

Autumn usually made him a full breakfast spread. There would always be seven or eight different dishes that were all beautifully presented and sumptuous.

Moreover, the dishes were different every day.

In comparison to that, this was the saddest breakfast ever.

The fire in his chest that had just died down flared up again.

Damien asked coldly, ""Is this all you made for me?""

Rosetta trembled from his question. ""I‚Ä¶ I'm sorry, Mr. Caldwell! Mrs. Caldwell has always been the one making you breakfast, so I don't know your tastes‚Ä¶""

""If you don't know, call and ask!""

Rosetta stammered, ""I tried, but I couldn't reach her‚Ä¶""

Damien stared at her wordlessly.

Well played, Autumn.

Still, Damien wasn't worried at all. He believed Autumn would be back sooner or later.

Maybe she'd even show up at his office by noon.

This was her usual roundabout approach to come crawling back.

Regardless, the misunderstanding had already ruined his appetite. He turned and stormed out.

Damien slammed the door behind him, causing the confused Rosetta to wonder what was up with him.

She anxiously called Autumn, but after several attempts, there was still no answer.

Rosetta was puzzled, but then figured it was probably because Damien had brought up divorce again.

In the past, Autumn would usually check in with her about Damien and return at just the right time.

But this was the first time she hadn't answered her phone.

After a moment of thought, Rosetta assumed Autumn had just gotten good at playing hard to get and was just being gone longer to make Damien feel uneasy without her.

That wasn't a bad move at all.

Everyone knew Damien never really cared about Autumn.

Damien was an outstanding man, and temptations were everywhere. If Autumn didn't try harder to get his affection, how could she possibly win over his heart?

‚Ä¶

Since Autumn didn't have to work on Saturdays, she could sleep in until noon.

She hadn't gotten groceries yet, so she ordered a large takeout meal.

After eating, Autumn browsed a technology forum. Some familiar faces had already become industry leaders, but she couldn't find any news about her mentor.

If she were not mistaken, her mentor was busy with research.

What she remembered most vividly was how warm her mentor's gaze was. It was just like Virginia's.

Yet, she had let her down‚Ä¶

As Autumn's eyes reddened, she hesitated for a moment before making a call.

""Olivia, let's meet up.""

Olivia Clements was Autumn's friend from university.

She would always be so happy whenever Autumn called, but now her tone lacked enthusiasm.

""I swear you cancel our plans nine times out of every ten invites. I may be your friend, but that doesn't mean you can keep wearing me down like this."" She then coldly asked, ""Think it through. Are you sure you want to meet?""

After getting married, Autumn had devoted herself to domestic life.

She hadn't meant to neglect her friendships, but she had.

As for Olivia, she had been focusing on her career. Her tech company had already made a name for itself and was a rising star in the industry.

The growing gap between them made Autumn less confident, so she reached out even less.

Taking a deep breath, Autumn slowly said, ""I'm getting a divorce.""

There was a pause on Olivia's end before she bluntly asked, ""Give me the time and place.""

‚Ä¶

Autumn went to the courthouse to file the divorce papers. The divorce would be finalized after a month, and only then would she get her divorce certificate.

She was done before three in the afternoon, arriving early at the caf√© where she was meeting Olivia.

She ordered a coffee and drank half of it when her whole body suddenly tensed, making her clutch her cup.

She hadn't expected to run into Damien within less than a day of divorcing him.

Chapter 3

Standing at the entrance of the caf√© was Damien in a tailored suit. With his refined air and model-like frame, many customers couldn't resist stealing glances at him, their amazement plain to see.

Beside Damien was a clean-cut man in his early 30s who was equally poised.

Autumn recognized him.

That was Luther Huffman, a professor in computer science at Averpark University. She'd recently read on a forum that he was currently researching the reliability of data-driven AI.

Behind them was Damien's assistant, Scott Keller, who had a folder in his arms.

Since Caldwell Group was the leading tech company in Havenmoor, Luther was probably there with Damien for a business meeting.

Autumn did not want to run into Damien at all, but leaving right then would only draw their attention. And so, she could only pray that they wouldn't see her.

Alas, luck wasn't on her side that day.

It only took a second for Damien to spot her, his eyes locking onto her with unerring precision.

Their eyes met.

As if he were merely looking at a stranger, Damien looked away coldly.

He couldn't care less that she was there.

Following his gaze, Scott also spotted Autumn. With the same exact nonchalant reaction, he turned and said, ""The private room is this way, Mr. Caldwell and Professor Huffman. Please, after you.""

Autumn quietly breathed a sigh of relief, only for the three to abruptly stop in their tracks.

Out of the blue, Luther asked, ""Mr. Caldwell, do you know the lady by the window? Pardon me for asking, but I couldn't help but notice you and your assistant glancing over to her.""

Damien had expected Autumn to appear at the company, but who would have thought she'd find her way there? He wasn't too surprised, but that didn't mean he wanted to see her.

Damien answered perfunctorily, ""She's just a housekeeper of mine.""

Luther was momentarily stunned.

He had asked not because Damien was looking at her, but because he remembered seeing her at a laboratory in Averpark University.

Averpark University was one of the best institutions in the country‚Äîno matter how poorly a graduate did in life, they'd still never need to become a mere housekeeper.

Not only that, he was sure that the person he was thinking about was a true prodigy.

At the moment, Luther's lab was facing a technical challenge. If he could get a genius like that to join his lab, the challenge could be overcome in no time.

But for some reason, that particular person had vanished mysteriously a few years back.

Luther had even looked up all the achievements and other related information of every graduate student, but none of them matched the genius he remembered, as none of them stood out.

Given her brilliance, he believed that a mere handful of her academic papers would've made waves across the field.

Becoming the youngest professor in Averpark University's history would've been a piece of cake for her, and maybe she could even make it into the Computer Science Research Institute's Hall of Fame.

The future of that person had been limitless.

Thinking of this, Luther sighed inwardly. He must be mistaken, so there was no need to dwell on it. ""Let's go, Mr. Caldwell.""

Without a second glance, Damien entered the private room.

Autumn's fingernails scraped against her cup, producing a harsh, grating sound.

Barry had once visited her and Damien's home and, after tasting her cooking, declared he wanted to marry someone with her culinary skills.

Hearing that, Damien had plainly remarked, ""So, a female chef is all it takes to satisfy you.""

Maybe it really was true that loving someone could make one dumb.

At the time, Autumn did not think much of that comment.

But looking back now, she found herself laughably pathetic.

Three years of devotion, and all she got in return was the label of a chef and a housekeeper. What a joke.

All of a sudden, Autumn was overwhelmed with discomfort. It was because of the belated realization that caused the pain, making her feel like a thousand tiny needles had pierced her heart relentlessly.

After Damien had entered the private room, Scott walked over and knocked on her table to get her attention.

Autumn snapped out of her thoughts, looking up.

With a displeased expression, Scott asked coldly, ""What are you doing here? Didn't Mr. Caldwell warn you not to check his whereabouts anymore?""

When Hank had been seriously ill before, Autumn had to contact Damien's secretary because she was unable to reach him. Eventually, she found him at a bar, completely wasted.

When she tried to help him back then, he had pulled her onto the couch and kissed her passionately, which both shocked and thrilled her.

Damien had always been cold, so that was the first time he'd ever initiated a kiss.

But the very next second, he murmured the name Emilia.

Autumn had instantly gone ice-cold from head to toe, struggling to break free. Once Damien sobered up, he'd flown into the biggest rage since their marriage.

He didn't return home for an entire month and warned her that if it ever happened again, he would make sure that they were divorced, and that even if Hank tried to intervene, he'd still go through with it.

Autumn had been too afraid to ever ask about his whereabouts since then, no matter what happened.

As Damien's assistant, Scott knew how much Autumn cared for Damien, but now he was starting to think something had changed.

She never had the guts before, as she wouldn't dare lose what little favor Damien still had for her.

For her to show up this boldly, did something happen to cause her to snap?

Soon after, Scott had an answer. ""If you're doing this because Ms. Mason is back in the country, you really ought to reconsider. Think about what she means to Mr. Caldwell. So don't you think what you're doing is pointless?""

Emilia had returned with a Ph.D. and passed the selection process to join Luther's laboratory.

Luther was a giant in the field. His researchers were all top-tier talents working on cutting-edge AI applications.

Scott believed Emilia's world was far beyond anything Autumn could even touch.

If he were in Autumn's shoes, he'd know his place. If he didn't, with how worthless he was, he'd just be crushed by the sheer difference between him and Emilia when they came face-to-face.

But clearly, Autumn lacked that awareness.

Scott and Autumn had never gotten along.

There wasn't any particular reason for that. It was just that since he was Damien's assistant, his attitude mirrored his employer's.

As such, Autumn had endured all of his cold shoulders and sarcastic remarks.

Back then, her world revolved around Damien, so she was always polite to Scott. No matter how rude and cold he was, she never reacted much.

But now, there was no need to put up with it.

Autumn retorted, ""And what exactly is pointless? By your logic, if I really were the kind of jealous stalker you say I am, wouldn't it make more sense for me to stalk him since this morning and secretly follow him everywhere he goes? Why would I even go through such trouble?""

Scott stared at her in surprise.

Autumn had always been meek in front of him. When had she become so sharp-tongued?

But then it dawned on him.

When Autumn lost her baby yesterday, Damien was by Emilia the whole time.

Scott believed that even the gentlest woman would act like this because of such a loss, which was why she was behaving differently.

Still, she wouldn't keep this attitude up for long.

Scott replied expressionlessly, ""I don't want to argue with you. Mr. Caldwell doesn't want to see you. Please leave.""

Sure, she could stay and be an eyesore to him, but that wouldn't do her any good.

There was no need to be immature.

""I've divorced Damien. Whatever I do now is none of your business. Don't try to tell me what I can and cannot do.""

With that, Autumn turned and walked out.

Scott watched her retreating figure, too dumbfounded to do anything but scoff.

How ridiculous of her.

Damien had asked for a divorce countless times. When had she ever really gone through with it?

What was the point of taking it out on him?

And if she was going to make such a bold claim, she should have at least made it believable.

Her wedding ring was still on her finger. Wasn't it even more laughable to say such an obvious lie?

‚Ä¶

After leaving, Autumn texted Olivia. ""Let's meet somewhere else.""

She had originally planned to go somewhere after meeting up with Olivia, but she couldn't wait any longer.

At the jewelry store, the clerk used a ring cutter to cut the wedding ring off Autumn's finger.

Because of all the strange supplements her mother-in-law, Linda Pace, had fed her over the years to help with fertility, she'd gained weight, and the ring had gotten stuck.

Once cut, the ring was treated as scrap and recycled based on the current market price for platinum.

Autumn had never liked anything too flashy, so her ring only had a few tiny diamonds, which weren't worth very much. The whole thing fetched less than two thousand dollars.

Olivia was so stunned by the paltry amount that she burst out laughing.

""You actually sold your wedding ring? Your act this time is pretty convincing.""

Given how Autumn had behaved the past three years, Olivia did not believe for a second that she'd ever truly go through with divorcing Damien.

Chapter 4

Offering no rebuttal, Autumn stared at the faint mark on her ring finger that wouldn't disappear anytime soon. ""This imprint looks awful. I should've removed the ring sooner.""

Hearing this, Olivia figured Autumn was serious this time.

Even though she couldn't be certain Autumn was serious this time, the latter's attitude toward this was better than ever before.

She knew it wasn't necessary to mock Autumn anymore, but she couldn't stop herself from saying, ""Your so-called love isn't even worth a decent meal to me.""

Autumn merely replied, ""Then let's go. I'll treat you to a meal.""

Showing no intention of moving, Olivia raised a brow at her. ""My time is precious. Tell me exactly what you want from me first, and I'll see if it's even worth my time to eat with you.""

Autumn looked at her wordlessly for a few seconds. ""I want to rewrite the thesis I previously stopped working on. I'll need to use your lab to run some data.""

The industry was evolving quickly, so she'd have to make a lot of adjustments.

Autumn hadn't dared to bring this up over the phone before because she had felt diffident.

Knowing Olivia, Autumn was sure she would scold her for wasting time all this while. After all, if Autumn hadn't gotten married, she'd have already published her paper when she was still in university.",1,1750660389.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
1li9i85,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1li9i85/after_6000_years_in_a_bottle/,After 6000 years in a bottle,"The bottle rolled.

It had spent centuries in a dusty cave, waiting, ignored, quietly brooding. Now it wobbled awkwardly on the sand, shimmering under the harsh sun.

A tourist in cargo shorts picked it up.

""Hey, babe!"" he called. ""I think I found one of those old genie bottles!""

""It‚Äôs probably mass-produced junk,"" his girlfriend shouted back, not looking up from her phone.

The man shrugged, twisted the lid‚Äîand with a thunderous WHOOSH, ancient seals cracked, centuries of confinement snapped, and the desert trembled.

A plume of dark smoke spiraled into the sky, twisting, contorting, and finally solidifying into a towering figure of fire and shadow.

Sakhr, the mighty Efrit, stretched his arms wide, flames licking his fingertips.

""At last! I am free!"" he bellowed, his voice rumbling like a sandstorm. ""Tremble before me, mortals, for I‚Äî""

The couple had already jogged back to their tour bus.

""‚Ä¶oh.""

Sakhr blinked.

His first act of terror had been ghosted.

He huffed, brushing sand from his shoulder.

""Solomon‚Ä¶"" he muttered, the ancient king‚Äôs name rolling off his tongue with a mix of seething anger and reluctant admiration. ""You sealed me for millennia, but I endure. Your wisdom‚Ä¶ irritatingly effective.""

His molten eyes scanned the landscape‚Äîroads, billboards, tourists in floppy hats.

""Where‚Ä¶ is the kingdom of men?"" he whispered.

He stomped toward a parking lot where a row of metal chariots hummed under the sun.

One beeped and drove away without a horse.

Sakhr staggered backward.

""By the black flames! Sorcery! Chariots‚Ä¶ without reins? Did Solomon unleash this magic?""

A nearby local vendor, chewing gum lazily, watched Sakhr gawk at a minivan.

""You lost, bro?""

""I am Sakhr, Scourge of Winds, Bringer of Infernos! Kneel!""

The vendor pointed at his sunglasses. ""Yeah, yeah. Look, cosplay‚Äôs down at the festival. Wanna kebab?""

""Kebab?""

The sizzling meat skewers drew Sakhr‚Äôs nose like a moth to fire.

""I have not tasted human food in‚Ä¶ six thousand years.""

""First one's on the house, genie man.""

Sakhr devoured the kebab whole, nearly eating the stick.

""This,"" he gasped, ""is better than roasted camel.""

""Yeah, we‚Äôve moved on since then.""

The vendor flicked his lighter. Sakhr‚Äôs eyes widened. A mortal could summon flame with a click?

""You wield fire?"" Sakhr asked, stepping back in genuine surprise.

The vendor shrugged. ""Lighters, bro. Two bucks at the gas station.""

Sakhr grabbed the lighter, flicked it, and stared at the tiny flame in his palm. Such power in the hands of peasants? What had Solomon‚Äôs world become?

With kebab grease still on his lips, Sakhr began to wander the modern city.

He passed glass towers that pierced the sky, glowing screens that whispered news from distant lands, people talking to small glowing slabs in their hands.

""I remember when a message took weeks, riding on trembling horses,"" he murmured. ""Now mortals converse across oceans in the span of heartbeats.""

A little boy almost bumped into him.

""Watch it, old man!"" the kid snapped, eyes glued to his phone.

Sakhr raised his fiery hand instinctively‚Ä¶ then stopped.

Destroy him? For a careless word? What would Solomon have done? The king who caged him‚Ä¶ had also spared him once.

Sakhr exhaled, his rage simmering into curiosity.

He followed the boy into a caf√©.

The boy sat with friends, all tapping away at their devices, laughing at glowing screens.

""What sorcery binds them so?"" Sakhr wondered aloud.

A barista handed him a cup of coffee.

""I did not order this.""

""Someone left it. Free coffee, big guy.""

Sakhr sniffed the dark liquid, sipped, and recoiled. ""This‚Ä¶ this is magnificent poison! Give me another.""

Cup after cup vanished into him. The caffeine hit him like a desert storm.

His thoughts raced. His heart drummed like war drums.

Was this the power Solomon feared?

""Perhaps,"" Sakhr mused, eyes darting around the buzzing caf√©, ""this is why he sealed me. Not for my strength‚Ä¶ but because he saw that one day mortals would surpass even jinn.""

He stomped outside, his steps quickening. A tiny rectangular beast on wheels zipped past‚Äîa skateboard.

The teenager riding it sneered. ""Outta the way, grandpa!""

""Do not trifle with me, impudent child!"" Sakhr roared, and in a fit of caffeinated bravado, he snatched a skateboard from a rack.

His fiery weight promptly shattered it.

A bystander clapped. ""Nice performance art!""

""What? No, this is no act‚ÄîI am the Efrit Sakhr! Bound by Solomon, freed by fate!""

""Rad name, bro.""

The bystander handed him a new skateboard.

Sakhr grimaced, stepped carefully this time‚Äîand wobbled straight into a trash can.

The crowd erupted in laughter.

And yet‚Ä¶ Sakhr found himself laughing too.

When had he last heard such unrestrained, human joy?

When had he last laughed?

He rose from the heap of garbage, brushing banana peels from his horns.

""Perhaps Solomon was right to seal me,"" he muttered. ""The world he envisioned‚Ä¶ is far greater than the world I sought to burn.""

His feet led him to a library.

He marveled at the rows upon rows of books‚Äîknowledge now shared with all, not hoarded by kings.

""Solomon‚Äôs wisdom echoes here,"" he whispered. ""A kingdom not of gold, but of thought.""

His hand traced a children‚Äôs book.

‚ÄòThe Little Prince‚Äô.

He sat and read, his enormous frame crammed into a tiny chair.

Hours passed.

A librarian cautiously approached. ""Sir, the library's closing.""

""Why?"" Sakhr‚Äôs voice rumbled. ""Is knowledge rationed in this age?""

The librarian chuckled. ""Nah, we just need to sleep.""

Sleep. Mortals still needed rest.

But they soared the skies, spoke across continents, cured diseases, built cities taller than Babel.

In his time, humanity had cowered before storms and Efrit.

Now, they harnessed the winds to fly.

""Solomon,"" Sakhr sighed as he stepped into the night air. ""You imprisoned me to protect them. But perhaps‚Ä¶ you believed in them more than I did.""

His gaze lifted to the moon.

""I sought to rule. You sought to teach. And look what they have become.""

He wandered until morning, watching joggers in neon shoes, street sweepers singing, bakers kneading dough.

There was still struggle, still imperfection, but the resilience of these fleeting creatures‚Äîhow they laughed, stumbled, built, and forgave‚Äîit defied him.

A street preacher called out to him. ""Brother! Do you know God?""

""I‚Ä¶ knew one who did,"" Sakhr murmured.

The preacher handed him a small pamphlet. Sakhr tucked it into his belt.

His stomach rumbled.

He returned to the kebab vendor.

""You again? Hungry?""

Sakhr nodded. ""Do you‚Ä¶ do you accept payment in ancient coin?""

The vendor laughed. ""First coffee‚Äôs free, second one‚Äôs two bucks. This is a two-buck world now.""

Sakhr grinned, his molten eyes softening.

""Then I shall earn it.""

""You looking for work?""

""I can‚Ä¶ sweep,"" Sakhr offered. ""I am adept at sand removal.""

""You're hired.""

And so, the mighty Efrit Sakhr, breaker of seals, adversary of Solomon, spent the afternoon sweeping sidewalks, sipping coffee, and learning to skateboard‚Äîpoorly.

Sometimes, he would mutter at the breeze, ""You would be proud, Solomon.""

Other times, when he fell off the skateboard again, he‚Äôd grunt, ""Curse you, Solomon,"" before laughing softly.

For in this strange, racing, chaotic world‚Ä¶
Perhaps even an ancient Efrit could find a place.

My hair used to be silky soft 4-5 years ago, so much so that it was almost straight. But now it has become rough, dry, wavy, and a bit curly right after hair wash. Over the course of the next few days, my hair weighs down with minimized volume. When I was in school, my hair was black, luscious, and voluminous, to the point that my classmates used to joke that it could be used as a rope to pull up someone falling from the roof. I never cared for my hair back then. But after a point, I started paying attention to the details, realizing that my hair is gradually thinning. I tried many products on my hair, but now my hair texture has changed completely. I even doubt my memory of having such good hair quality as an adolescent and early adult. 
Whenever I see haircare products and supplements on social media claiming to actually work, I am tempted to buy them but somehow hold myself back. I eat healthy food with occasional junking. I don't have a sweet tooth, but my sugar intake is usually through my beloved cold coffee (very often), chai (almost daily), and desserts (once in a while). 
I started using Soulflower rosemary serum every night and I believe some hairgrowth is happening. But my hair is falling, too, probably owing to the humid weather here right now. I am consistent with the serum usage except for some skips in between. But my hair quality is still as described above. The shampoo and conditioner that I am using is from Moxie. I alternate my hairwash with Densita shampoo and Love, Beauty & Planet hair mask.

I'm super curious and love making last-minute plans, whether it's exploring a new spot in the city, hitting up a park, or just chilling with good company.

Since I purchased a River 3 Plus with extra EB300 two months ago, the device is a real beauty, I wanted to have something similar in my kitchen to power various home appliances. Unfortunately, the River 3 Plus can only deliver up to 600w, which is not enough for my toaster, soup maker and coffee machine. Other power stations were either too bulky, ugly or noisy.

Then I saw the beautiful new product line of Stream (AC Pro), adding the possibility to feed-in power surplus from my exiting roof solar installation into my grid. 4 weeks ago, I went for it, not one, but TWO Stream AC Pro with Ecoflow Smart Meter. For the latter, it was quite a hassle to find an electrician to install it, but after 3 weeks, I finally found one. **Don't do this yourself !**

My New Life's Hotter Than Your Money | A Revenge Romance You'll Regret Missing","**Screw You, Ex! My New Life's Hotter Than Your Money ‚Äì Divorce Drama with a Fiery Twist**

* Chapter 1

When Cassidy Morgan opened her eyes again, she found herself reborn at 27 years old.

At this point in her life, she had two children and was married to Gabriel Westbrook, the billionaire CEO who consistently topped the Forbes list and had been named ""The #1 Most Desirable Bachelor"" by TIME Magazine‚Äîa man so sought after that even the British royal family had once hoped to marry their princess to him.

Everyone told her how fortunate she was. Yet the first thing she did after this rebirth was bring divorce papers to his childhood sweetheart.

""I want a divorce,"" Cassidy said calmly, sliding the document across the table to Natalie Hayes. ""Gabriel is yours. The children too. All yours.""

Natalie stared at her in shock, unable to believe that the woman who had occupied the position of Mrs. Westbrook for six years would suddenly volunteer to step aside.

""Since they all prefer you anyway,"" Cassidy added with quiet resignation, ""I'll make it easy for everyone. Just get Gabriel to sign these papers. Once the cooling-off period ends, I'll be gone.""

This time, she refused to repeat her mistakes. She wouldn't continue being the invisible Mrs. Westbrook that everyone overlooked.

Natalie's fingers unconsciously traced the rim of her coffee cup as she frowned. ""What game are you playing, Cassidy?""

""No game,"" Cassidy replied evenly as she observed the shifting expressions on Natalie's face. ""I'm simply done.""

""Do you have any idea how many women would kill to be in your position?"" Natalie challenged.

""I do,"" Cassidy met her gaze directly. ""That's why I'm giving it to you.""

A crack finally appeared in Natalie's perfect fa√ßade.

She studied the divorce papers for a long moment before taking them. ""Well, if you're being so generous, I won't refuse.""

""Just remember,"" Natalie added, ""once I have something, I never give it back.""

""Don't worry,"" Cassidy smiled faintly. ""I absolutely won't regret this.""

After all, in her previous life, she had already tasted the bitterness of a lonely existence.

Natalie moved to another table and elegantly picked up her phone, her fingers dancing across the screen.

When the call connected, her voice instantly softened: ""Gabriel, I'm at Blue Mountain Caf√©. Could you come pick me up?""

Cassidy sat nearby, a bitter smile playing on her lips.

There had been a time when she called Gabriel, only to have his assistant answer nine times out of ten.

Yet now, in less than twenty minutes, the man who was always ""in meetings"" appeared at the caf√© entrance.

Through the glass window, Cassidy watched Gabriel stride in, his tailored black suit accentuating his broad shoulders and narrow waist.

Six-year-old Ethan and four-year-old Emma immediately spotted Natalie and rushed to her, hugging and kissing her affectionately.

""Auntie Natalie!"" Emma called sweetly, nuzzling her face against Natalie's.

Gabriel placed a cake box on the table, his long fingers gently pushing it forward. ""Matcha, your favorite. I had the chef reduce the sugar.""

Natalie's eyes lit up. ""You always remember the details.""

Cassidy sat in the corner, her fingers unconsciously digging into her palms.

In six years of marriage, Gabriel had never bothered to learn her preferences. In her previous life, when she was hospitalized and craved strawberry cake, he had his assistant buy one randomly‚Äîit turned out to be mango, which she was allergic to.

""What would you like for dinner?"" Gabriel asked, his deep voice smooth and refined. ""French cuisine or Italian?""

Natalie smiled coyly, pulling out the divorce papers from her purse. ""Before that, there's a document I'd like you to look at.""

She flipped to the signature page. ""I've found a house I love, but I'm short on liquid assets. Could you...?""

Gabriel took the pen and signed without even glancing at the content. ""Between us, why keep such formalities?""

""Is Auntie Natalie buying a new house?"" Ethan looked up and asked. ""Dad, you should buy one next door! Emma and I want to live with Auntie Natalie instead of staying with Mom all the time.""

Gabriel's brow furrowed slightly, but seeing the children's hopeful expressions, he relented. ""I'll arrange it.""

""No need to go to such trouble,"" Natalie quickly interjected. ""I'll reserve three rooms for Ethan, Emma...and you. You can visit whenever you want.""

The children cheered, and Emma even hugged Natalie's neck and planted a kiss on her cheek. ""Auntie Natalie is the best! A thousand times better than Mom!""

Witnessing all this, Cassidy felt as though an invisible hand was squeezing her heart, the bitterness and heaviness making it almost impossible to breathe.

She saw the slight upward curve of Gabriel's lips‚Äîa tenderness he had never shown her.

Unable to watch anymore, she grabbed her purse and left.

As she walked through the door, memories of her past life flooded back.

In her previous life, she had entered a business marriage with Gabriel, gave birth to two children, and lived until she was 62‚Äîyet never found happiness.

All because Gabriel's heart had always belonged to his college sweetheart, Natalie Hayes.

When they broke up years ago, Natalie went abroad. Gabriel drowned his sorrows in alcohol for days, but his pride prevented him from chasing her. Instead, he agreed to the arranged marriage their families had planned.

Gabriel had been Cassidy's girlhood dream‚Äîaristocratic, almost god-like. Which socialite in NY didn't dream of marrying the heir to the Westbrook empire?

So when she learned their families were arranging their marriage, she was ecstatic.

But after the wedding, though she poured all her love into their relationship, Gabriel remained distant and cold.

Until Natalie returned.

He never mentioned divorce to Cassidy, yet his gaze never left Natalie.

Worse still, the children also grew to prefer Natalie, gradually becoming distant from their mother.

In her later years, Cassidy was diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Gabriel, using ""peaceful recovery"" as an excuse, abandoned her in their old mansion.

On her birthday, her trembling hands dialed her husband and children, only to learn they were vacationing with Natalie in the Maldives.

She tried to bake herself a birthday cake, but in her confused state, forgot to turn off the oven...

As flames engulfed her, Cassidy's final memory was of Gabriel's cold eyes as he placed the wedding ring on her finger.

She closed her eyes in agony, with one wish: if given another chance, she would never again sacrifice her life for him.

When Cassidy returned to the mansion, night had already fallen.

Instead of resting, she immediately began clearing out items‚ÄîGabriel's suits and shirts, the children's toys, family photos‚Ä¶ everything went into cardboard boxes.

""What are you doing?"" Gabriel's voice suddenly came from behind her.

Cassidy turned to see him standing in the doorway with both children, his brow deeply furrowed.

""Why is Mom throwing away our things?!"" Emma rushed over, her face flushing red with anger when she saw her teddy bear being placed in a box.

Ethan glared at her furiously too. ""We were just hanging out with Auntie Natalie for a bit. Why are you being such a drama queen about it?""

Gabriel looked at her, his gaze cold as always. ""The kids prefer spending time with Natalie. Do you really need to throw a fit over something so trivial?""

""I'm not angry,"" Cassidy said calmly.

""Liar!"" Emma screamed. ""You're just jealous of Auntie Natalie! That's why you're throwing away my teddy bear. You're a terrible mother!""

""When I grow up, I'm moving in with Auntie Natalie,"" Ethan grabbed his sister's hand, spitting the words viciously. ""And I'll never come back to see you!""

Gabriel made no attempt to stop the children's outburst. He merely frowned slightly, his deep eyes sweeping dismissively over Cassidy‚Äîas if she were just an unreasonable stranger.

""Enough,"" his thin lips barely moved, his deep voice carrying an innate arrogance as his long fingers casually adjusted his cufflinks. ""I have a board meeting video call. Pack whatever you want, just keep it down.""

The moment the door closed behind him, Cassidy's tears finally fell. Her heart felt torn to pieces, each breath tasting of blood.

She wiped away her tears, looked at the mess scattered across the floor, and suddenly laughed.

Don't worry, she wouldn't disturb him‚Äînot now, not ever again.

Chapter 2

After signing the divorce papers, Cassidy stopped managing household chores.

No longer did she rise at 5 a.m. to prepare nutritious breakfasts for the children or stay up late making hangover soup for Gabriel after his business dinners.

All the duties she once considered her responsibility were now left to the servants.

At first, no one noticed the change.

Until Ethan was late for school and got scolded by his teacher, Emma couldn't find her homework notebook, and Gabriel's pocket watch stopped ticking.

The servants scrambled to keep up, yet couldn't match the hostess's standards.

Unwashed dishes piled in the kitchen, children's toys scattered across the living room, and pressed shirts were never quite smooth enough‚Ä¶ the once-immaculate home gradually fell into disarray.

When Gabriel pushed open the bedroom door, Cassidy was leaning by the window, reading.

Sunlight filtered through the curtains, casting dappled shadows over her.

""How long do you plan to continue this?"" he stood at the doorway, his voice low.

Cassidy closed her book and looked up at him. ""Continue what?""

""Why have you stopped taking care of the household?"" He stepped closer, the faint scent of ambergris lingering in the air. ""Are you still angry about what happened?""

""I'm not angry,"" she placed the book aside. ""I just don't want to do it anymore.""

Gabriel narrowed his eyes, his long fingers tapping on the table. ""Why?""

""I'm tired,"" she replied calmly. ""We have servants. I don't need to do everything.""

She recalled her previous life, rising before dawn every day.

Gabriel's coffee had to be exactly 85¬∞C, his sandwiches toasted to golden perfection. The children's clothes required hand-washing, even their socks needed perfect pressing.

But what did it get her? Nothing but Gabriel's tenderness toward Natalie, the children's affection for ""Auntie Natalie,"" and ultimately, her lonely death alone in that mansion on her sixty-second birthday.

""Cassidy,"" his voice grew colder. ""If you're throwing a tantrum, just say so. Don't act like a three-year-old.""

She gave a slight smile. ""I'm not throwing a tantrum. I just need a break.""

Before he could respond, the door burst open.

Ethan and Emma charged in, their faces flushed with anger.

""Mom is so lazy!"" Emma shouted shrilly. ""We want Auntie Natalie to take care of us!""

Ethan joined in. ""Auntie Natalie is more loving, more hardworking, a million times better than you!""

Gabriel's gaze remained fixed on Cassidy, seemingly waiting for her to back down.

But she just took a deep breath and said quietly, ""If you think she's better, then invite her over. I don't mind.""

The air instantly froze.

And Gabriel's expression darkened completely.

""Are you sure?""

Cassidy took a deep breath. ""Absolutely.""

""Daddy, let's go!"" Emma tugged impatiently at Gabriel's sleeve. ""I want Auntie Natalie to come right now!""

""Now that we have Auntie Natalie, we don't need you anymore!"" Ethan made a face at Cassidy. ""You can leave this house!""

Gabriel gave Cassidy one last look. Seeing her unmoved, he turned and left with the children, his footsteps heavy.

Cassidy stood motionless, listening to the car engine fade into the distance, and slowly closed her eyes.

Soon, she would grant their wish‚Äîleaving them completely, leaving this house forever.

Chapter 3

Natalie moved in the very next day and immediately ordered the servants to redecorate the living room.

""This sofa is too somber,"" her slender fingers brushed over the leather, turning to Gabriel with a gentle smile. ""Gabriel, can we replace it with something in cream?""

Without even blinking, Gabriel instructed the butler: ""Do as Natalie says.""

Cassidy stood at the staircase landing, watching workers carry out the sofa she had carefully selected just six months ago.

Ethan and Emma followed Natalie like shadows, excitedly pointing at various items. ""Auntie Natalie, these pillows need to go too! Mom bought such ugly ones!""

Natalie stroked their heads affectionately. ""Alright, we'll change everything.""

Cassidy's fingers tightened momentarily before relaxing again.

Those pillows had been hand-stitched by her during pregnancy, filled with hypoallergenic down cotton specifically because the children had sensitive skin as babies.

Yet now they were unceremoniously tossed into the garbage.

In the following days, the house became increasingly unfamiliar.

At the dining table, Natalie sat in what had been Cassidy's place, tenderly serving food to the children.

Gabriel occasionally poured her coffee himself, his long fingers gently pushing the cup toward her, his eyes showing a softness Cassidy had never received.

In the evenings, the living room lights would dim, and the four would huddle on the sofa watching movies: Emma curled up in Natalie's arms while Ethan leaned against Gabriel's shoulder, their laughter constantly filling the room.

When Cassidy passed by, they wouldn't even glance at her, as if she were invisible.

More laughably, Gabriel, Ethan, and Emma had once been impossibly fastidious about their living standards.

But now?

She watched Natalie carelessly toss Gabriel's million-dollar Patek Philippe watch on the coffee table, face down, while he lovingly put it on without complaint. She saw the children happily wearing school uniforms that Natalie had simply thrown in the washing machine, collars still stained with yesterday's sauce. She watched Natalie pass off takeout as home-cooked meals, with none of them calling her out‚Ä¶

Even more absurd was how they pampered Natalie‚Äî

""Natalie, don't touch these chores,"" Gabriel stopped her from clearing the teacups, his long fingers gently pressing on her wrist. ""Your hands are meant for playing the piano.""

""Auntie Natalie, let me carry your bag!"" Ethan eagerly took her limited-edition handbag, his fawning expression something Cassidy had never seen on her son's face.

""Miss Hayes only needs to rest,"" the butler respectfully offered Italian handcrafted slippers. ""Leave everything to us.""

How ironic.

She had been the family's unpaid housekeeper for six years, completely taken for granted. Yet the moment Natalie arrived, she became the princess on a pedestal.

The servants whispered among themselves:

""The master is so good to Miss Hayes, I've never seen him treat Mrs. Westbrook that way.""

""The children adore her too. I bet this house will soon have a new hostess!""

Cassidy had already grown numb, no longer caring about anything, simply quietly packing her belongings.

Until that afternoon when her phone suddenly began vibrating frantically.

""Madam! Young Master and Miss have had an allergic reaction at school! An ambulance just took them to the hospital!""

When Cassidy arrived at the hospital, both children had been rushed to emergency.

Gabriel stood in the hallway, his suit jacket casually draped over his arm, his tie hanging loosely around his neck, cold fury simmering in his eyes.

""Cassidy,"" his voice was low, suppressing rage. ""What exactly are you doing?""

Cassidy was taken aback. ""What?""

""They're allergic to mango. You know that, right?"" Gabriel stepped closer, his tall figure looming over her. ""Why did you let them drink mango juice?""

""It wasn't me!"" Cassidy met his eyes. ""I never bring mango into the house.""

Ever since the children's first allergic reaction to mango landed them in the hospital, she had been incredibly vigilant‚Äîwarning everyone repeatedly about their allergy, even personally reviewing the school cafeteria menus. How could she make such a basic mistake?

""Not you?"" Gabriel sneered. ""Then who? The servants? Or did they try to poison themselves?""

Cassidy opened her mouth to speak, but a nurse interrupted: ""The children are awake.""

In the hospital room, Ethan and Emma lay pale-faced in their beds. When they saw their parents enter, something flickered in their eyes.

""What happened?"" Gabriel demanded sternly.

The children exchanged glances, then simultaneously pointed at Cassidy: ""It's Mom! She bought snacks with mango!""

Cassidy froze, staring at them in disbelief. ""What are you saying?""",1,1750659605.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False
