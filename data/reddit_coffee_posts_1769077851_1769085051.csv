1qjt7su,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepyencounters/comments/1qjt7su/rommate_was_strange_and_weird_noises_in_apartment/,Rommate was strange and weird noises in apartment,"Hello. I've had something weird that happened to me 5 years back and I'm curious what you guys think. Since I can't recall all the details from back then, I looked up my diary and copied the story from there so that it feels fresh. So this is what I wrote 5 years ago:

  
So I've had an experience that is still very confusing to me. I don't even know how to start, that's the worst part.  


Two years ago I started college and after I've had a pretty bad time in my dorm room I've decided to move in with one of my friends. As the rent was pretty expensive and I've just come from a dorm room that was really cheap, we decided to search online for a flatmate.  
That's how we met Grace (lets call her that), a girl that appeared so nice at the beginning.  


Anyway, we kept living with her, moving from that apartment to a better looking one where we spent almost a year.  
About a month ago, the owner said that we had to leave because he was selling the apartment. After a lot of drama that went on, because now instead of 3 we were 5 ( including my sister and a friend that wanted to move in with us) Grace said that the best way is for us to split and said she wanted to stay with me and my sister. At the time it seemed like the perfect way for everybody to be included and not left out. And she said it in a very pure way, so I didn't think she had any bad intentions about it.  


Anyway, my friend got upset and one of our good friends suddenly started to meddle and she called Grace on the phone (which is basically an acquaintance to her, nothing more) because she said that this rommate of ours that was ny friend was crying. Grace came to me and said that this friend talked very badly about me which made me not want to have anything to do with them. And so we started looking for an apartment.  


To continue I have to explain how Grace's personality was: she was very sweet and honest. She was very religious ( She said that she was a charismatic), but she often said that she is pro LGBTQ+ community (all of us are straight so she didn't feel pressured to say so) and was very opened about everything. I, at the time, identified myself as an atheist.  
As we were searching for apartments I've noticed that my sister became very distant towards Grace. (They usually got along pretty well) and I don't know why because it's usually so easy for me to talk to her, but I couldn't ask her why she was so distant. And she couldn't talk to me about it because she said she felt bad that she was having a bad feeling about Grace after so long and without a reason.  


We finally found an apartment after a week that was incredibly cheap for the area that it was in ( it was situated right in the middle of the town).  
Now, in this town that I'm studying, there is an infestation with cockroaches. And we've had them in the kitchen of the last apartment were we've lived. And i have a phobia of insects .   
what I forgot to say about Grace is that she has a very ""foul mouth"". I don't know if you have this expression in English but in my language it means that when you say something bad, if you have a foul mouth then it usually happens. It's a superstition of ours. And when we moved in, she told us that she is scared that we are going to have cockroaches in this apartment too. Two days later, there they were on the open balcony that was incorporated in my room. Good thing is that they were only in the outside and she found only one inside, which is a big change from the last place that we've lived in.  


As soon as we moved my sister's mood towards Grace started to become better, but what was bad was that I was starting to see her personality change. She started to become mean: always talking bad about the friends that I've had those problems with in the other apartment and asking when have I last talked to them over and over again everyday. She started to become very clingy as well, which was a big wow because for the last 2 years she was always minding her own business behind a closed door. And she always talked about the insects that may come in and so I couldn't sleep more than one hour/ night and with the lights on because I was scared that the insects would come in.  
What was strange was that even after a week has passed, I still couldn't close one eye at night because of how scared I was which didn't sound like me ( seeing as I've lived in an apartment were there were insects on the inside, and here they were on the outside). All I knew was that there was always a fear present at night and I assumed it was because of the insects but I'm not so sure now. What I know is that I was so stressed because the finals for college started and I couldn't concentrate because I couldn't sleep. And Grace was not helping because I was starting to feel a very bad vibe coming from her. I don't know how to explain it, I'm not the most emphatic as a person but I just felt tired and upset wherever she appeared. And she had a tendency to always laugh out of nothing so me being stressed and talking to her and seeing her laughing while I'm telling her that I think I'm gonna fail all of my exams was not really helping.  


One night at the start of the third week that we've been living there, my sister woke me up because Grace couldn't get out of her room because the door was blocked. (One thing that is important is that I'm a very deep sleeper just like Grace, and my sister is not)  
My sister then said that she was awake ( it was about 3 am) because she was studying and she kept hearing noises coming from Grace's room for like half an hour. And then she went to check up on her and she had broken the door handle and said that she's stuck (which surprised my sister because she didn't understand why she didn't call us)  
I get there and, just as she'd told me, Grace couldn't get out. She was laughing behind the door and we've tried for like an our to get her out without success. The door got blocked whitout reason, there was no key in it and she didn't even shut the door with force, she said she closed it gently. After some time she started panicking: crying, yelling, she kept punching the door, and we got scared because we thought that she was having a panic attack.  


My sister called the police which directed us to the firemen department. It was already 5 o'clock and Grace said that we should wait until 7 so we don't disturb the whole block. I heard her yell at someone inside ( on the phone I assume) which was also the first time that I've seen her mad.  


We all went to sleep and at 6am we woke up with the loudest banging on the door. It was Grace because she started crying and yelling again. Finally the firemen showed up and they got her out.  
The next night, i was woken up by my sister at 5 am ( I went to sleep at 3) and she was freaking out because she thought that someone had broken into our place. She said that for about 2 hours there was a continuous noise in the hallway. Banging on the door just like the day before when Grace got locked in, but this time it was without reason. And loud footsteps all over the apartment. I went to check the hour on my phone and that's when i noticed something weird. Before going to sleep I turned on two small lights that were on batteries next to my head. And I am a little bit OCD so I know exactly where I put them: one next to my head on the left side and one on the table next to me on the right so they are symmetrical. I woke up with both of them turned off and the one on the table was trown in my bed. My phone again, I left it charging and I woke up with it without the charger in it and at 50% battery. When I woke up it was at 38% so that means that it was pulled out of the charger after about 10 minutes after I fell asleep.  
I freaked out because I couldn't possibly do this in my sleep, seeing as when I'm tired I don't even move from the position that I've fallen asleep in. When we asked Grace, she said that she didn't hear anything and she got really defensive every time we brought up the discussion, saying that we shouldn't talk about this things.  


Next night both me and my sister left the lights on and the doors open everywhere so we can we if we hear something (except for Grace's room). Needless to say, we both heard right outside our rooms (which are pretty far away) an exhale that sounded like a man.  
The next night we slept together in my sister's room and this time I've also heard the noises. So loud and all night long. And Grace again, said that she didn't hear anything. I've asked her how is she so fazed by all this and not afraid at all ( she was sleeping in the dark without a care in the world even though she was the one that hot locked up in her room only a few nights ago) and she told me that this is nothing. She kept talking about a dark period of hers when something bad happened to her back home and said that she used to hear voices and that her parents wanted to take her to see a specialist. In that moment I got scared and asked her in what sense -voices outside or inside her head-. She said that they were inside her head and that they weren't good things and that she felt non-stop like she was watched and couldn't sleep. And said that she went through something that might scare me, but that it's good and it's nothing to be frightened about because that's what helped her not hear the voices again. I got a little scared again but asked her to say it anyways. (In the meantime she was talking about how she had a problem with cockroaches but she didn't mind bees at all) we went on the balcony and as not even 5 minutes after she said that she is okay with bees, a bee flew into her mouth and she had to spit it inside her cup of coffee. It seemed funny at the time but now that I think about it, not so much. Afterwards she told me that they had a process in the church where there are scheduled meetings when the holy spirit enters them. And then they roll their eyes and start speaking in tongue and jump around in a trance. And she kept telling me over and over that I should come too. And now she was saying that she thought that people that don't believe in God are shallow ( knowing that I was an atheist at the time) , and that she thinks that the LGBTQ+ community is disgusting, even though for the last 2 years she said that she was open minded and that both of those preferences were everybody's personal choice. Ever since then, with the noises and all, we couldn't live there and we got too scared that we slept over at a friend's house until we went to our hometown. I also found out from the friend that talked bad that one time in the last apartment about me, that Grace lied about it and that she didn't say anything bad.  


It's been three weeks since then and I still barely sleep (I can't sleep alone or with the lights off, I turn on the tv and sleep with someone) and my sister is struggling just like me. I jump at each sound that is even slightly higher than usual and has a normal explanation and start panicking and crying. I'm just scared all the time and am afraid to be alone during daytime, let alone at nights and I don't know what to do. All i do is keep going back to the conversations that I've had with Grace because i think that she might have had something to do with what happened and freak myself out even more. I feel like I've never left that apartment that I've only spent 3 weeks in and it's the worst feeling that I've ever felt. I'm sorry that I've written so much. I just don't understand any of this situation and I don't know what to think of it, but every explanation that I find scares the life out of me so I don't know what I should do.



Any thoughts? I've thought of anything, paranormal or not, if I overreacted, if I misjudged Grace and saw details just because I was way over my head. What do you think?",1,1769084817.0,creepyencounters,0,1.0,False

[US Congress Secure Minerals Act: Supply Chain Security](https://discoveryalert.com.au/secure-minerals-act-2026-supply-chain-vulnerabilities/)

https://preview.redd.it/a5v3z60x3weg1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=d13a6bd1410f67cff305b61ebfcd5bfba07f1538

The intersection of geopolitical tension and supply chain concentration creates unprecedented vulnerabilities for advanced economies relying on specialised materials for their most strategic industries. When single nations control the processing and refining of elements essential to defence systems, renewable energy infrastructure, and emerging technologies, the resulting dependencies transcend traditional trade relationships and evolve into potential leverage points that can influence national policy decisions.

These dependencies have accumulated gradually over decades as manufacturing shifted toward regions offering cost advantages, while consuming nations focused on downstream assembly and innovation rather than maintaining comprehensive supply chain control. The **US Congress Secure Minerals Act** emerges from this strategic reality, representing a fundamental reassessment of how supply chain vulnerabilities intersect with [critical minerals energy security](https://discoveryalert.com.au/critical-minerals-energy-transition-2025-energy-security/) imperatives.

Current data reveals the scope of American import reliance across critical mineral categories. The United States depends on foreign sources for over **89% of its requirements** across more than 50 critical minerals, with particularly acute vulnerabilities in rare earth elements, lithium processing, and specialty metals required for advanced manufacturing. This dependency pattern extends beyond raw materials to include processed forms and intermediate products that require specialised refining capabilities.

The defence sector faces especially concentrated risks, with **23 identified weapon systems** relying on single-source mineral imports. These systems span multiple platforms, including radar arrays requiring high-performance permanent magnets, precision-guided munitions utilising rare earth-based components, and electronic warfare systems dependent on specialised materials with no readily available substitutes. The vulnerability extends to maintenance and spare parts availability, creating operational readiness concerns that compound initial procurement challenges.

Economic modelling indicates that approximately **$847 billion in annual economic activity** across aerospace, automotive, renewable energy, and technology sectors faces direct exposure to supply disruption scenarios. This figure encompasses not only the immediate production value but also downstream economic effects including employment, technological innovation, and competitive positioning relative to other advanced economies.

# China's Strategic Market Positioning Creates Systemic Dependencies

The concentration of critical mineral processing capacity within Chinese industrial networks represents perhaps the most significant structural challenge facing Western supply chain resilience. According to International Energy Agency analysis, China maintains dominant positions across **19 of 20 key strategic minerals**, with an average market share of **70%** in refining and processing operations.

This concentration extends beyond simple market share metrics to encompass technological capabilities, infrastructure investments, and integrated supply chain architectures that developed over multiple decades. Chinese rare earth processing capacity accounts for **91% of global refining operations**, whilst permanent magnet production has increased from 50% market share two decades ago to **94% today**. These figures reflect sustained investment in specialised facilities, technical expertise development, and vertical integration strategies that created comprehensive control over multiple processing stages.

Recent export control implementations demonstrate how concentrated supply chains translate into geopolitical leverage. Beginning in **April 2025**, China imposed restrictions on seven heavy rare earth elements and related products, creating immediate shortages for American and European manufacturers. European market prices increased to **six times domestic Chinese levels**, illustrating the price manipulation potential inherent in monopolistic supply structures.

The restrictions expanded significantly by **October 2025**, encompassing foreign-made products containing Chinese-sourced rare earths, additional elements including holmium, erbium, and ytterbium, and essential processing equipment. These measures affect production across defence, aerospace, semiconductor, industrial motor, and artificial intelligence data centre sectors, revealing the breadth of vulnerability across supposedly unrelated industries.

Lithium-ion battery supply chains present similar concentration patterns. Chinese control extends across **80-95% of midstream and downstream production**, including cathode precursors, anode materials, lithium iron phosphate cathodes, and finished battery cells. This vertical integration creates dependencies that persist even when raw lithium extraction occurs in other countries, since processing and manufacturing capabilities remain concentrated within Chinese industrial networks.

Furthermore, the timeline for developing alternative supply sources compounds these strategic challenges. Mining, refining, and manufacturing projects outside China typically require **eight or more years** from initial planning to operational capacity, whilst existing alternative sources lack sufficient scale to offset Chinese production volumes during supply disruption scenarios.

# Legislative Architecture of the Strategic Resilience Reserve

The **US Congress Secure Minerals Act** establishes a fundamentally new institutional framework for managing critical mineral security through the creation of a Strategic Resilience Reserve operating as an independent government corporation. This structure represents a deliberate departure from traditional government stockpiling mechanisms, incorporating hybrid public-private governance designed to combine strategic oversight with operational flexibility.

The **$2.5 billion initial funding authorisation** provides Congressional appropriation for establishing reserve capacity and conducting initial mineral acquisitions. The funding mechanism enables both immediate stockpile building and longer-term investment in domestic supply chain development, including recycling infrastructure and alternative source development. Unlike traditional appropriations that flow through existing federal agencies, this independent structure grants operational autonomy whilst maintaining strategic oversight.

**Seven-member board governance** ensures balanced representation between government strategic interests and industry technical expertise. Presidential appointment with Senate confirmation creates accountability mechanisms whilst requiring specialised qualifications that enable informed decision-making regarding complex mineral markets, processing technologies, and supply chain dynamics. The board structure allows rapid response to market conditions whilst maintaining democratic oversight over strategic resource management.

Legal experts emphasise that the legislation creates entirely new authority rather than expanding existing stockpiling programmes. This architectural choice reflects Congressional assessment that legacy institutions lack the structural flexibility required for modern critical mineral challenges. The National Defense Stockpile, established during World War II, operates under different legal frameworks and mission parameters that proved inadequate for contemporary supply chain complexity.

# Operational Mechanisms for Market Intervention

The Strategic Resilience Reserve incorporates multiple acquisition approaches tailored to specific mineral categories and market conditions. Market-based purchasing protocols enable commercial procurement during periods of price stability or surplus supply, capitalising on favourable market dynamics to build reserves cost-effectively whilst avoiding market distortion through excessive government intervention.

Moreover, strategic stockpiling approaches complement market-based mechanisms through direct negotiation with producing nations, investment in domestic production capacity, and long-term contract arrangements that guarantee supply access during disruption scenarios. These approaches recognise that certain critical minerals require proactive intervention rather than reactive purchasing strategies.

Release mechanisms encompass both emergency deployment during supply disruptions and commercial market stabilisation designed to moderate price volatility without triggering panic responses that could destabilise markets further. Strategic reserve releases require sophisticated market timing to maximise effectiveness whilst preserving reserve capacity for genuine emergency scenarios.

International partnership frameworks enable allied nation contributions to reserve capacity with Presidential approval, creating burden-sharing arrangements that distribute costs whilst expanding access to global mineral resources. These partnerships may involve scenarios where allied nations contribute minerals abundant within their territories in exchange for accessing American Strategic Resilience Reserve capacity during their own supply disruptions.

The legislation explicitly emphasises domestic projects, recycled materials, and alternative mineral sources alongside traditional stockpiling, indicating recognition that supply chain resilience requires comprehensive transformation rather than simple inventory management. This approach encompasses investment in domestic processing capabilities, advanced recycling technologies, and research into substitute materials that reduce dependency on concentrated supply sources.

# Economic Impact Analysis Across Strategic Industries

The **US Congress Secure Minerals Act** projects significant economic benefits across industries that depend heavily on critical mineral imports, with effects extending beyond direct cost savings to encompass employment creation, competitive positioning, and technological innovation capacity. Economic modelling indicates that supply chain stabilisation generates compound benefits through reduced uncertainty, improved cost predictability, and enhanced domestic manufacturing competitiveness.

https://preview.redd.it/0zqcz0v04weg1.png?width=1098&format=png&auto=webp&s=055f4d259a90d4f261325f202ebee6bdecddaf1f

Aerospace manufacturing faces particular vulnerability through dependence on titanium alloys, speciality composites, and rare earth magnets essential for flight control systems. The **89% foreign sourcing** baseline reflects decades of global supply chain optimisation that prioritised cost reduction over supply security. Projected cost stabilisation of **12-18%** results from reduced price volatility, shortened supply chains, and decreased risk premiums currently embedded in procurement contracts.

Electric vehicle production dependencies concentrate specifically on lithium, cobalt, nickel, and rare earth elements required for battery systems and electric motor components. The **76% battery material import dependency** creates vulnerability to both price spikes and supply disruptions that can halt production lines. Supply chain savings of **8-15%** reflect reduced procurement costs, inventory optimisation, and decreased logistics complexity through domestic source development.

However, defence contractors experience the highest vulnerability levels at **94% rare earth import dependency**, reflecting the concentrated use of specialised materials across multiple weapons platforms and electronics systems. Procurement security improvements of **20-35%** encompass both cost stabilisation and supply reliability, critical factors for maintaining operational readiness and meeting delivery schedules for defence contracts.

Renewable energy systems depend heavily on permanent magnets containing rare earth elements for wind turbines, electric vehicle motors, and energy storage systems. The **82% permanent magnet import reliance** creates project development uncertainty and cost volatility that affects renewable energy competitiveness. Project cost reductions of **10-22%** enable expanded deployment whilst improving economic viability of clean energy investments.

# Regional Economic Development Opportunities

The Strategic Resilience Reserve creates catalytic effects for regional economic development through domestic mining project acceleration, processing facility development, and recycling infrastructure expansion. Investment incentives and regulatory streamlining for critical mineral projects generate employment in regions with suitable geological resources whilst building technical expertise in specialised processing operations.

In addition, processing facility development focuses on midstream capacity building in strategically located regions that offer transportation advantages, workforce availability, and infrastructure support. These facilities require highly skilled technical personnel, creating employment opportunities that support regional economic diversification whilst building domestic capabilities in specialised manufacturing operations.

Recycling infrastructure expansion encompasses urban mining operations that extract critical minerals from electronic waste, end-of-life batteries, and industrial waste streams. These facilities create circular economy integration that reduces import dependency whilst generating domestic employment in waste processing, materials recovery, and secondary refining operations.

Research and development hubs coordinated with universities and national laboratories accelerate technology transfer from academic research to commercial applications. These partnerships focus on substitute material development, advanced extraction techniques, and processing efficiency improvements that enhance domestic competitive advantages in critical mineral industries.

# International Coordination Mechanisms for Supply Chain Diversification

The **US Congress Secure Minerals Act** operates within broader international coordination frameworks designed to reduce Western dependencies on concentrated supply sources through multilateral cooperation, burden-sharing arrangements, and coordinated investment in alternative supply chain development. These mechanisms recognise that critical mineral security represents a shared challenge among allied democracies requiring coordinated responses.

# Multilateral Partnership Development

Recent coordination efforts demonstrate growing international recognition of supply chain vulnerability. Finance ministers from major economies, including Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the European Commission, participated in Washington D.C. discussions focused on diversifying supply chains and developing financial mechanisms for improved resilience.

These multilateral frameworks emphasise coordinated investment in alternative supply sources, shared research and development initiatives, and joint purchasing arrangements that leverage collective demand to incentivise new production capacity outside concentrated supply regions. Coordination mechanisms enable smaller nations to participate in supply chain development projects that would be economically unfeasible individually.

Furthermore, allied procurement coordination creates joint purchasing power that reduces individual nation exposure to supply disruptions whilst distributing development costs across multiple participants. These arrangements may include forward contracting for production capacity, shared investment in processing facilities, and coordinated stockpiling that enables mutual access during emergency scenarios.

# Strategic Partnership Development

The United States and Brazil strategic partnership exemplifies bilateral cooperation focused on leveraging complementary resource endowments and technical capabilities. Brazil maintains approximately **21 million tonnes of rare earth reserves**, representing significant potential alternative supply capacity for Western supply chains currently dependent on Chinese processing operations.

This partnership encompasses diplomatic engagement, industry collaboration, and financial institution involvement designed to accelerate Brazilian rare earth sector development whilst creating supply diversification for American consumers. However, Brazilian sector development faces substantial challenges, including limited investment capital, incomplete geological surveys covering approximately **30% of national territory**, and insufficient processing infrastructure.

Technology transfer agreements enable sharing of processing expertise and capacity building that accelerates alternative supply source development. These arrangements may include joint venture partnerships, licensing agreements for specialised processing technologies, and technical training programmes that build domestic capabilities in partner nations.

For instance, international coordination extends beyond bilateral partnerships to encompass regional supply chain integration initiatives. Projects linking French and Japanese collaboration for rare earth oxide production in Lacq, France demonstrate how allied nations can coordinate different supply chain segments to reduce collective dependency on concentrated sources.

# Competitive Response to Export Control Measures

Chinese export control implementations beginning in April 2025 accelerated international coordination efforts by demonstrating the real-world consequences of concentrated supply chain dependencies. European prices reaching six times domestic Chinese levels for affected materials created immediate economic incentives for alternative source development whilst highlighting the strategic importance of supply diversification.

Alternative supply source development encompasses mining projects in Australia, Canada, and African nations, processing capacity construction in allied countries, and recycling technology advancement that creates domestic resource recovery capabilities. Nevertheless, development timelines typically exceed eight years from initial planning to operational capacity, creating significant gaps between current vulnerabilities and future supply security.

Processing capacity onshoring receives particular emphasis given the concentration of refining operations within Chinese industrial networks. Domestic refining facility investment requires substantial capital, specialised technical expertise, and environmental compliance capabilities that present significant barriers to rapid capacity development.

Research collaboration frameworks enable joint development of advanced extraction and processing technologies that improve efficiency whilst reducing environmental impacts. These initiatives focus on breakthrough technologies that could accelerate supply chain development whilst creating competitive advantages for allied nations participating in collaborative research programmes.

# Implementation Challenges and Legal Framework Considerations

The **US Congress Secure Minerals Act** faces complex implementation challenges spanning Congressional legislative processes, regulatory framework development, and industry integration requirements that will determine ultimate effectiveness in addressing critical mineral supply chain vulnerabilities. Legal experts emphasise that substantial refinement will occur before final enactment, potentially including integration into larger legislative packages such as the [National Defense Authorization Act](https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/3617).

# Congressional Legislative Process Dynamics

Committee jurisdiction mapping across Natural Resources, Armed Services, and Energy oversight bodies creates coordination requirements that may slow legislative progress whilst ensuring comprehensive policy integration. Multiple committee involvement enables thorough vetting of technical specifications, budgetary implications, and implementation mechanisms whilst creating opportunities for amendment and modification during the legislative process.

Amendment probability assessments indicate significant likelihood of modification during Congressional consideration, particularly regarding funding mechanisms, governance structure, and international cooperation provisions. Standalone passage faces political challenges that may favour integration into broader defence or energy legislation with established bipartisan support.

Bipartisan support sustainability depends on maintaining focus on national security implications whilst managing concerns regarding government market intervention and industrial policy precedents. Election cycle impacts create timing pressures that may influence legislative strategy and priority positioning relative to other Congressional initiatives.

# Regulatory Implementation Requirements

Federal agency coordination encompasses multiple departments including Defense, Commerce, Energy, and Interior, each contributing specialised expertise whilst requiring coordination mechanisms that prevent jurisdictional conflicts and ensure coherent policy implementation. Regulatory guidance development requires extensive technical input regarding mineral designation criteria, acquisition protocols, and release mechanisms.

Environmental review acceleration through National Environmental Policy Act streamlining creates tension between rapid deployment objectives and established environmental protection procedures. Critical mineral projects require comprehensive environmental assessment whilst benefiting from expedited review processes that balance security imperatives with environmental stewardship.

International trade law compatibility requires careful attention to World Trade Organisation subsidy regulations and international agreement obligations that may constrain Strategic Resilience Reserve operations. Legal compliance mechanisms must ensure that reserve activities support legitimate national security objectives whilst avoiding protectionist measures that could trigger trade disputes.

# Industry Integration and Partnership Development

Private sector partnership structures require sophisticated legal frameworks that enable collaboration whilst preventing conflicts of interest and ensuring competitive fairness. Public-private cooperation frameworks must balance government strategic objectives with industry commercial interests whilst maintaining transparency and accountability mechanisms.

Intellectual property considerations become particularly complex when government investment supports private sector technology development and capacity building. Technology transfer agreements require careful structuring to protect competitive advantages whilst enabling knowledge sharing that advances overall supply chain resilience objectives.

Workforce development needs encompass technical training programmes for specialised processing operations, equipment maintenance, and quality control procedures that require substantial investment in human capital development. Certification programmes and skill development initiatives must create domestic expertise comparable to international competitors whilst supporting employment creation objectives.

# Strategic Transformation Through Technology and Innovation

The development of advanced processing technologies represents a critical component of establishing [mining innovation trends](https://discoveryalert.com.au/mining-industry-evolution-2025-trends-innovation/) that can reduce dependencies on traditional supply chains. Innovation in extraction methods, including bio-mining and enhanced recovery techniques, offers potential for accessing domestic resources previously considered economically unviable.

Advanced recycling technologies present opportunities for creating domestic supply sources through urban mining of electronic waste and industrial by-products. These technologies require sophisticated processing capabilities but offer significant potential for reducing import dependencies whilst addressing environmental challenges associated with waste management.

Artificial intelligence and machine learning applications in mineral processing optimisation can enhance efficiency whilst reducing costs and environmental impacts. These technological advances represent competitive advantages that could enable domestic processing operations to compete effectively with established international suppliers.

# Alternative Material Development

Research into substitute materials that can perform equivalent functions to critical minerals represents another pathway for reducing strategic vulnerabilities. However, material substitution requires extensive testing and qualification processes, particularly for defence and aerospace applications with stringent performance requirements.

Consequently, the development of a comprehensive [critical minerals strategy](https://discoveryalert.com.au/big-pivot-critical-minerals-strategy-2025/) must balance investment in alternative supply sources with research into substitute materials and enhanced recycling capabilities.

# International Cooperation and Competitive Positioning

The establishment of an [European CRM facility](https://discoveryalert.com.au/critical-raw-materials-crm-facility-2025-european-supply/) demonstrates how allied nations are developing parallel approaches to critical mineral security challenges. These developments create opportunities for coordination whilst requiring careful attention to maintaining competitive advantages.

The implementation of the [US mineral production executive order](https://discoveryalert.com.au/us-mineral-production-executive-order-2025-national-security/) alongside the Strategic Resilience Reserve creates a comprehensive framework for addressing both immediate vulnerabilities and longer-term capacity building requirements.

Trade policy coordination with allied nations requires balancing cooperation benefits with maintaining sufficient domestic capacity to ensure supply security during various disruption scenarios. These considerations encompass both emergency response capabilities and longer-term competitive positioning in emerging technology sectors.

# Long-Term Strategic Outcomes and Success Metrics

The **US Congress Secure Minerals Act** requires comprehensive evaluation frameworks that measure both immediate supply chain improvements and longer-term strategic transformation across multiple dimensions including economic competitiveness, national security enhancement, and technological innovation capacity. Success metrics must encompass quantitative performance indicators alongside qualitative assessments of strategic positioning and resilience capabilities.

# Quantitative Performance Indicators

Import dependency reduction targets provide measurable objectives for supply chain diversification efforts, with specific percentage goals established for each mineral category based on strategic importance, substitution feasibility, and domestic production potential. These targets must balance ambitious transformation objectives with realistic timelines that account for development lead times and capital investment requirements.

Strategic reserve capacity metrics encompass tonnage objectives and coverage duration calculations that ensure adequate buffer capacity for various disruption scenarios whilst maintaining cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. Reserve sizing requires sophisticated modelling that incorporates consumption patterns, supply volatility, and emergency deployment protocols.

Economic impact measurements track job creation across affected industries, gross domestic product contributions from expanded domestic production, and cost savings achieved through supply chain stabilisation. These metrics must distinguish between direct effects from Strategic Resilience Reserve operations and indirect benefits from broader supply chain transformation initiatives.

Supply chain resilience scoring systems evaluate disruption response time, recovery capability, and overall system robustness through stress testing scenarios that simulate various supply interruption situations. Resilience metrics encompass both immediate response capabilities and longer-term adaptation mechanisms that enable continued operations during extended disruptions.

# Policy Implementation Milestones

Regulatory framework completion requires federal agency rule-making processes that translate legislative authority into operational procedures, guidance documents, and compliance requirements. Implementation timelines must coordinate multiple regulatory processes whilst ensuring coherent policy integration across affected industries and government departments.

Industry partnership establishment encompasses private sector engagement strategies, collaboration agreement development, and joint initiative planning that leverage combined public and private capabilities. Partnership development requires trust-building processes, intellectual property agreements, and cost-sharing mechanisms that align incentives whilst protecting competitive interests.

International cooperation development focuses on allied nation coordination mechanisms, joint reserve management protocols, and crisis response planning that enable burden-sharing whilst maintaining national sovereignty over strategic resource management. International frameworks must balance cooperation benefits with maintaining independent capabilities during emergency scenarios.

Technology advancement tracking measures innovation metrics, competitive positioning improvements, and breakthrough development that enhance domestic capabilities whilst reducing dependency on foreign technical expertise. Innovation assessment requires evaluation of research and development effectiveness, technology transfer success, and commercial application achievements.

The Strategic Resilience Reserve represents a fundamental shift in American approach to critical mineral security, moving from reactive vulnerability management toward proactive supply chain transformation. Success will depend on sustained political support, industry cooperation, international coordination, and technological innovation that collectively reduce dependencies whilst building domestic capabilities essential for long-term economic competitiveness and national security.

Furthermore, the legislation must navigate complex implementation challenges including regulatory coordination, industry integration, and international cooperation requirements that will ultimately determine its effectiveness in addressing strategic vulnerabilities. The comprehensive nature of these challenges requires sustained commitment across multiple election cycles and consistent bipartisan support for long-term strategic objectives.

The Economic implications extend far beyond immediate cost savings to encompass employment creation, regional development opportunities, and enhanced competitive positioning across multiple industrial sectors. These benefits must be carefully measured and communicated to maintain political support whilst demonstrating tangible progress toward strategic objectives.

# FORM YOUR OWN OPINIONS & CONCLUSIONS ABOVE:

https://reddit.com/link/1qjt4dw/video/h6zgyndt6weg1/player

# Elk Creek Isn’t a Penny Stock Mine — It’s a U.S. National Strategic Asset (And IMHO $6 Is a Joke!)

**To be blunt:** the Elk Creek project is no longer just a “mining story.” It is shaping up to be a **strategic industrial asset aligned directly with U.S. national security policy**. The Secure Minerals Act, DoD supply chain mandates, EXIM financing priorities, and onshoring policy all point in the same direction: America needs **domestic, scalable, multi-mineral supply chains**, not single-commodity juniors with decade-long timelines. NioCorp checks boxes most projects can’t even touch: **permitted, engineered, late-stage, polymetallic, defense-relevant, and near-term financeable**.

This is not hype — this is structural alignment. Elk Creek hosts **Seven Critical Minerals** tied directly to defense, aerospace, electrification, and industrial base security:  
**Niobium (armor alloys, superalloys), Scandium (next-gen aerospace alloys), Titanium/TiCl₄ (airframes, hypersonics, pigment, defense), plus Nd/Pr/Dy/Tb (permanent magnets for guidance systems, EVs, drones, radar, motors).** Congress just admitted the U.S. is dangerously exposed on all of these. Projects that can realistically produce this decade are no longer optional — they’re **strategic infrastructure**.

**The market is also lagging the technical reality!!** New assays point toward meaningful resource uplift, the **DFS is imminent**, and NioCorp has already demonstrated metallurgical viability across its flowsheet. Meanwhile, scandium pricing is no longer theoretical — the DoD signed deals (Rio-Tinto) at **$6,250/kg**, validating real demand. At just the existing FS production level (\~104 t/year), Elk Creek would instantly become one of the largest scandium suppliers outside China/Russia. That’s before you even account for potential upside from improved grades, flowsheet optimization, or expanded mine planning.

[For 30 years, every aerospace, EV, and defense prime has said the same thing about scandium: “We can’t design Sc-Al alloys into next-gen systems until there’s a reliable U.S. supply.” & “ We can’t build a U.S. supply until someone commits to using the alloys.” That deadlock is exactly what stalled the entire U.S. scandium industry… until now. \~Niocorp just broke the loop. NioCorp solved SCANDIUM'S \\""The Chicken or the Egg problem!\\"" & are working to produce alloys to make \\""STUFF!\\""](https://reddit.com/link/1qjt4dw/video/m3aib9e97weg1/player)

Now layer in what the market isn’t pricing at all: **Vertical integration**. Scandium is not just a commodity — it’s a gateway to **ScAl alloys** (lighter, stronger aerospace materials). If the (Feb. 2026 **ScAl alloys** w/) Lockheed/DoD materials pathway emerges (as has been widely speculated), that moves NioCorp from “miner” to **strategic advanced materials supplier**. Add future magnet REE separation and recycling potential, and you’re talking about a domestic loop from **ore → oxide → alloy → component → recycle**. That is exactly what U.S. industrial policy is trying to build!

EXIM financing and Final Investment Decision are the real inflection points. If EXIM backs this and FID lands (realistically mid–late 2026), the valuation framework changes entirely. You don’t price that like a speculative explorer — you price it like a **permitted, financeable, policy-backed critical infrastructure project**. At that point, $6/share doesn’t look conservative. It looks **disconnected from reality**!!

This isn’t about hype. It’s about recognizing when a project crosses the line from “interesting” to **structurally inevitable**. Elk Creek is sitting at the intersection of geology, engineering, defense policy, and industrial reshoring. **Those are rare. And they don’t stay mispriced forever!**

**This is why EXIM, DoD, and Tier-1 primes are in deep discussions —** they need a fully domestic, fully integrated producer, and NioCorp is already architected to deliver exactly that.

***This is how you rebuild U.S. materials sovereignty —*** not one metal at a time, but with a single project that brings SEVEN critical minerals into four critical defense mineral chains back onshore at once!

**When the dust settles, Elk Creek won’t be “a mine.” It will be a cornerstone of the U.S. national security ecosystem.** The U.S. is signaling it. EXIM just confirmed it. And the global critical-mineral bottleneck is about to meet its first American challenger in decades.

1qjt3tl,https://www.reddit.com/r/samharris/comments/1qjt3tl/an_engineers_worries_on_ai_progress/,An Engineers Worries on AI Progress,"I just wrapped up watching the [discussion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Zz2KrBDXUo) with Dario and Demis, and couldn't help but be struck by statements I feel to be false.

For context, I work in the field and have for over a decade. The rate of progress will continue for now, and models will get better across the spectrum of cognitive tasks. As they noted, more and more entry level positions will lessen in the labour market. I see this today, as my company has rapidly slowed the rate of hiring at that level, and is even discussing reducing that portion of the workforce.

Dario stated that the labour market would adapt as it always does. His example was that farmers became factory workers, and factory workers became knowledge workers. But what do knowledge workers become? As far as I can see, knowledge and creativity is the last bastion of human capability. His view that things will continue as they did, I believe, is false.

That's not to say that some pockets of the labour market will find areas of progress which hitch onto this explosion of democratized cognitive tools, but the rate of change here is vastly different than the previous shifts.

Moreover, the level of control boards of directors have is also worrying - as they operate solely to maximize shareholder value. At some point, there's going to be a balancing act between the general populations ability to pay for goods and services, and rate of revenue growth for companies. This transition, as far as I can see, will be extremely disruptive. Even as balance is found, retirement funds that are needed and yet so attached to the health of businesses will see declines.

I hear discussions here and there on labour market disruption, but most of the oxygen gets consumed by AGI talks. I can't help but feel the 2-3 year horizon here is going to hit society must faster and harder than we'd like to admit.

Things like graduates not being able to find work, entry-to-mid level workers being shed from organizations, meaningful pursuits such as the arts being replaced entirely by AI-driven flows forced by capex, etc.

I just don't see how we go through this without massive pain and suffering given the forcing functions at work.

Anyways, just coffee thoughts from a concerned software engineer. I can feel the water boiling month after month. 

As a hard example: lookout for massive layoffs in FAANG companies throughout the year of 2026 (which will be some of the first companies to pull on these levers).

**Feeling uninspired? Procrastinating like a panda on a treadmill? Fear not, fellow wordsmith! Let's outsmart this block with ninja tactics:**

**Environment Hacks:**

* **Shower Epiphany:** Write steamy scenes (figuratively, please) in the shower. Guaranteed inspiration (or at least clean ideas).
* **Nature Nudge:** Write under a tree, feeling the breeze whisper secrets (or scold you for slacking).
* **Coffee Catastrophe:** Spill coffee on your manuscript? Panic, then laugh, then write about it. Bonus points for caffeine-fueled creativity.

**Spark Your Inner Weirdo:**

* **Automatic Writing:** Set a timer, close your eyes, and let your subconscious scribble. Prepare for hilarious nonsense or hidden gems.
* **Cut-Up Chaos:** Chop up quotes, headlines, or song lyrics, then Frankenstein them into a bizarre story.
* **Dream Diary Delusion:** Record your dreams, even the nonsensical ones. They're like free story prompts from your subconscious.
* **Random Object Roulette:** Spin a pen, point at your bookshelf, write a story about the book it lands on. Embrace the chaos!

**Challenge Your Inner Critic (Shut it Up):**

* **Write the Worst:** Write the absolute worst scene imaginable. You'll be so embarrassed, you'll write something good to redeem yourself.
* **Cliché Challenge:** Write a scene using every writing cliché in the book. Then rewrite it, destroying clichés with your brilliance.
* **Mirror, Mirror:** Stare into the mirror and have a deep conversation with your reflection about your story. Bonus points for dramatic monologues.
* **Future You Fury:** Imagine your future self, successful and published, berating you for procrastinating. Write a scene about their disappointment.

**Bonus Tip:** Reward yourself with something ridiculous for every completed scene. Like a dance party to the Macarena or wearing a lampshade as a hat. Embrace the absurdity!

Remember, writer's block is just a temporary hurdle. With a little wit and these offbeat techniques, you'll be back to churning out words like a caffeinated squirrel on a sugar rush.

For example he will tell me if the dinner I cooked wasn’t very good, or if something I’m wearing doesn’t look great. He does it politely though, and I appreciate that. 

There are times where things don’t make sense though, and it’s always something that doesn’t really matter. A repeated example is if something happens in the night he will claim to not remember it, even though we talked in the night and I can’t understand how he can’t remember when he was so alert. Or I ask him if he’s done something around the house and he says yes, come to find it looks like he didn’t. And he’ll say “well I thought I did”. Or he took a sip of my coffee and I asked him if he drank some and he’ll quickly say “no” and I was like but I just saw you? And he’ll say something like he didn’t realize that he did it. Little things like that. They just don’t make sense. 

I truly believe he hasn’t lied to me about any major things. These little white lies don’t seem intentional to me, it’s almost like there just isn’t much thought into his answers sometimes before he says it.

I know some people will say “it’s just 10 cents,” but that’s not the point. Llaollao got backlash when they first opened for the exact same issue, not having enough coins for change. This shouldn’t be happening, especially with established brands.",7,1769083823.0,nasikatok,3,0.82,False

1qjsuap,https://www.reddit.com/r/anhedonia/comments/1qjsuap/coffee_helps_with_anhedonia_better_than/,Coffee helps with anhedonia better than amphetamine?,"The chronic issue for me is low motivation to do things and low interest in activities, I always need something super exciting and new to feel alive and over time it's harder and harder to find something like that because I've already tried a lot of activities and interests and I liked them until the novelty fully faded, it's the same with people etc. In regular day-to-day life I feel lethargic, sluggish, usually disinterested but sometimes i may get excited about some things, always switching activities and it's hard to focus on non-stimulating things. I also have some anxiety but it's mild, mostly it's just a sense of anhedonia, bad mood and boredom. I wish I could like these simole routine things and feel like they're some sort of achievement but I can't. But I avoid many stimulating activities because they're ultimately bad for me and I want to have a more stable life, even though my brain doesn't like it. This seems like consummatory and anticipator anhedonia but I'm also diagnosed with ADHD, so maybe that comes from it.

What helps:

I've tried escitalopram and a couple of other SSRI's in the past and they didn't help. My go to for anhedonia and mood has always been caffeine. It doesn't help much with attention and organisation but It does lift my mood and hedonic tone quite a bit until I become very tolerant to it. However, I had to cut back drastically on it because of ADHD meds. I've tried some supplements in the past but they didn't help much.

In the past I would take methylphenidate, which only helped partially with ADHD symptoms like inattention, disorganised speech, poor memory, hyperactivity etc. But it didn't do anything for pleasure from activities or motivation, I felt quite anhedonic on it. Then I got switched to Vyvanse, I'm still in titration at 40mg (may up it to 50 or 60 later but not more than that). It  gives me better ADHD symptom control (there are some residual symptoms but it's generally better) than methylphenidate and kind of increases hedonic tone just a bit. In the first 3 hours it gives me a mood lift and an increased interest in activities, but it's worse than coffee yet more sustained/less spiky and then I get a bit anhedonic, maybe a bit better than baseline, but focus is intact. I can't really drink much coffee on it though, it ramps up side effects. 

I don't really know what to make of it. Is it just a component of ADHD or ""true"" anhedonia? How come amphetamine doesn't fully address it whereas caffeine does a better job?",2,1769083695.0,anhedonia,0,1.0,False

Not sure what to do.,"I (37F) recently reconnected on a dating app with a guy I went on three dates with back in 2020. At the time, it didn’t really go anywhere and we stopped seeing each other without much drama.

We matched again recently and have been chatting for about a week. It started as joke, I messaged him back asking if he even remembered that we’ve tried already. Honestly, five years has changed him a lot — he’s still charismatic, funny, flirty and smart, but he also seems way more grounded. He’s clearly put effort into himself: he dresses better, lost weight, and generally seems like he’s got his life together. He comes across as much more mature.

Before we met up, I asked him if he’d be okay with just being friends, given that we’d already tried dating once and it didn’t work. He said yes, no problem.

We caught up for coffee last week… and I was not prepared for how attracted I’d feel. The chemistry was definitely there on my end. I left feeling confused because I genuinely enjoyed his company and found myself wanting more than “friends,” despite being the one who set that boundary in the first place.

Now I’m stuck in this awkward middle space:
	•	I don’t want to send mixed signals or come across as flaky.
	•	I also don’t want to ignore how different this feels compared to 2020.
	•	And I’m not sure whether attraction + personal growth is enough reason to revisit something that didn’t work the first time.

Has anyone been in a situation where someone from your past felt like a different person years later? Is it reasonable to reopen the conversation and admit I might be open to more, or should I stick to what I initially said and keep things strictly platonic?

**Status**: concluded

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Original: WIBTA if I told my daughter to find a different hobby?**

My daughter Ann (17) has been obsessed with building miniatures ever since she saw Hereditary a few months back. Since then, she has probably spent close to 500 dollars on miniature sets from Amazon, Hobby Lobby, and etsy. All of this money comes from her job at a local movie theatre, so I can't exactly cut her off.

I can't explain why, but something about it drives me up the \*\*\*\*ing wall. Maybe it's because Toni Collette was so creepy? Maybe I just want to spend some quality time with my daughter instead of watching her waste her life in her bedroom. 

I hear my sister talk about dropping her daughter off at soccer, or how her son's the lead in the school play, and then think about how my daughter's upstairs building a tiny cottage with tweezers. She hasn't ever really shown interest in any hobbies before, so I thought it would be grateful that she's finally good at something, but mostly I'm just annoyed. 

Her grades are fine (Bs), her chores are always done, but mostly every second of her spare time is spent putting together miniatures. I try to ask her if she'd like to go for a walk with me, or sign up for cheerleading, but she always says no. 

My husband thinks its sweet and has started letting her put them around the house and in his office at work. Every day, I drink coffee next to a 60 dollar miniature greenhouse, and think about when the last time I had a genuine conversation with my daughter that didn't revolve around the merits of craft glue versus hot glue was.

I know I'm probably the asshole, but would I be the asshole if I asked her to find another hobby that might help her in life? Like something she could stick on a resume?

\--------------------------------------------

**Comments:**

**Comment1:** YTA. Your daughter has found something she loves and you're not being supportive. She's not doing drugs, why aren't you happy that she has an interest?

**Comment2:** Yta. She has a hobby and is a good kid. It could lead to a career, prop design, architectural design. Etc. Is cheerleading that much better or does it just play into some unfulfilled popularity fantasy of yours?

>**OOP**: I was popular growing up, lmao. Maybe IATA here but sue me for wanting my daughter to experience first dates and football games and going to prom with her friends and weekend sleepovers. It's heartbreaking knowing your child doesn't have a ton of friends.

**Comment3**: YTA. If you want to spend more time with her, do it. Go chat with her while shes working. It doesnt even have to be about models. Maybe even join her in making them. Parents getting involved in their child's hobby is super normal.   
Parents telling their kid to stop doing their perfectly safe and normal hobby just because they dont like it is not. You admit its not causing problems with her grades or anything, so theres no problems. Hobbies arent for resumes. They're for fun.   
Wtf kind of hobbies did you have as a 17 year old that you put it on your resume? Unless you woodworked and went into carpentry or something like that, practically no hobby is going to relate to your job.

>**OOP**: I was on the debate team, dance team, and creative writing club. I did a lot of things that got me out into the world and meeting new, interesting people. I know a lot of people are going to assume I'm trolling for attention because I can see how it looks like I'm the asshole, but I guess I'm just worried that she's going to head off in the real world some day after missing the best days of her life, with nothing to really show for it. I want her to have a good head start on things and this is just making her dig her heels more into her comfort zone.

**Comment4**: YTA - We have hobbies as an escape we can enjoy. Not for resume fodder.

>**Comment5:** Right this could be good for a resume. Speaking as a dentist, when I was applying for school it was important you had hobbies that showed you work with your hands and have good fine motor skills. This would be perfect for that.  
\-----  
**Comment6:** Museum Conservation—The fine motor skills are awesome!!! My friend got into a conservation program with no relevant schooling just bc she had the chutzpah to bring her tiny detailed embroidery work to the interview. Shows fine motor skills, attention to detail, incredible sustained focus. Now she is the conservator at a world class national museum.

**Comment7**: YTA.  
Attention to detail. Craftsmanship. Focus. Self motivation. Appreciating beauty in things many don’t.  
These are all valuable, even if the literal miniature building doesn’t go anywhere.

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Update (5 months later)** 

Belated update to a post that was largely considered trolling, but wasn't.

I won't lie when I say that I immediately ignored the majority of you telling me I was the asshole. Or maybe ignore is the wrong word. I think I expected that from the get go, so being told I ""peaked in high school"" and ""should get fucked along with all the plastic cheerleader wannabe SAHMs"" rolled off my back. 

But, there were a few of you that did make me think long and hard about my relationship with my daughter and what sort of model (haha) I was setting for her. There was one comment in particular that's been sort of lost to the flood (if you can find it, I'd surely appreciate that) that mentioned my writing and how well it read, almost like a book.

Maybe it's self absorbed, but that's really what made me stop for a moment. I've had to sacrifice a lot to get my family where they are today. I won't get into details because I'm sure it would be boring and pretentious and might make you all feel that I'm just trying to garner sympathy after being such a bitch, but it did involve giving up my dreams in order to make sure there was food on the table. 

I gave myself some time and space to think and realized the problem stemmed from me, not her. (Surprise) I was bitter that everyone else seemed free to chase their passions when I had to work at things I hated for the things we needed. It seemed childish to me to be so selfish as to enjoy your free time when you could be making an effort for your family instead. That's neither here nor there but it definitely wasn't my daughter's fault that I was so resentful.

I like to think she was relatively unaware of my concerns with her hobbies (I never voiced my opinion one way or another and always drove her to Michaels\*\*) but I can say with certainty that our relationship has only improved in the last few months. I helped her build a miniature restaurant last Saturday and I've got a fun little carnival on my nightstand as I type this. I can't regain the time I've lost, but I can make sure she doesn't have to live the life I'm currently living.

Thanks for everything.

1qjslgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1qjslgl/i_turned_35/,I turned 35,"Here’s 35 things I’ve learned along the way about focus, energy, and avoiding burnout that I hope help you in your journey:

1. Energy is your currency. Spend it wisely, don’t waste it on distractions.
2. Taking a break is not slacking. It’s recharging.
3. Your attention is precious. Guard it as you would money.
4. Consistency beats motivation. Start small and keep going.
5. Multitasking is a myth. Focus on one thing at a time to get results.
6. The brain gets tired like a muscle. Train it gradually, don’t overdo it.
7. High-dopamine activities like endless scrolling drain your focus more than they entertain.
8. Flow states are worth chasing. You’ll feel alive, engaged, and productive.
9. Sleep is non-negotiable. Without it, focus, memory, and mood collapse.
10. Journaling your energy, tasks, and distractions gives clarity you can’t get any other way.
11. You can’t pour from an empty cup. Self-care isn’t selfish.
12. Tiny habits compound. One minute of meditation can lead to hours of focus later.
13. Not all breaks are equal. Mindless phone scrolling is not a break, it’s a reset to distraction.
14. Caffeine and energy drinks are temporary fixes, not long-term solutions.
15. Saying “no” protects your time and focus. It’s a superpower.
16. You can’t fix bad focus by forcing it. Adjust your environment instead.
17. The right environment is a productivity multiplier. Remove distractions before relying on willpower.
18. Micro-goals prevent overwhelm. A 10-minute start often becomes a 2-hour flow session.
19. Learning is easier when your brain isn’t exhausted. Rest before challenge.
20. Notifications are thieves of attention. Silence them strategically.
21. Movement resets your brain. Walks, stretches, or exercise improve focus more than coffee.
22. Mindful breathing lowers stress and prevents mental fatigue.
23. Focus is a skill, not a trait. You can train it like a muscle.
24. Gratitude and reflection improve clarity and energy management.
25. Work in sprints, rest intentionally, repeat. It beats endless grind mode.
26. Burnout is a slow process. You’ll see the signs if you pay attention.
27. Avoid overcommitment. Every “yes” costs focus.
28. Celebrate small wins. They are the fuel for continued energy and focus.
29. Your environment shapes your habits more than your motivation does.
30. Saying “I’ll start tomorrow” is the fastest way to stay stuck. Start today, even tiny.
31. Quality focus beats quantity. Two hours of deep work is better than eight hours of distracted work.
32. Your energy ebbs and flows daily. Align tasks with your peak focus periods.
33. Flow and focus aren’t just for work. They improve learning, creativity, and hobbies too.
34. Reducing burnout is not eliminating effort. It’s investing effort intelligently.
35. My best tip and hope for us: Protect your focus, recharge your energy, and build a life that sustains flow.

If you’re lucky enough to reach 35, the patterns in your life become clearer.  
Some days you’ll be hyper-productive, other days exhausted.  
But with awareness and small, consistent habits, you can prevent burnout and maximize your energy.  
Enjoy the ride.

Onward!

1qjsl1h,https://v.redd.it/80rdge4unueg1,Got tired of rsync + ssh + run. Made a CLI to do it in one step.,"I kept doing the same thing: rsync to a remote, ssh in, run a command, wait, copy the output. So I made a CLI for it:

        rr run ""make test""

Syncs via rsync, runs via SSH, streams output, full TUI monitoring interface. Single binary. While this demo is running my test suite, it can run *any* command on a configured host.

Spent probably too much time on the TUI 😬. It uses Bubble Tea for spinners and progress bars. There's a `rr monitor` command that shows CPU/RAM/Latency across your hosts in a little dashboard that I use more than I expected to.

Some other bits:

* Connection failover (list multiple SSH paths, tries in order so it can try LAN first, then automatically fallback to tailscale if you're at a coffee shop)
* Load balances tasks across available hosts.
* Named tasks via config so I type `rr test` instead of the full command (`rr run 'make test-backend-partition1 && test-backend-partition2 && make test-frontend'`)

I use this mainly for load balancing my development test suite across a mac mini cluster so I can run all my tests in a few dozen seconds instead of minutes.

While this might often be true for espresso, I just had a revelation by actually grinding coarser for my V60. 

I am still in the experimenting phase, figuring out what settings I like and have been toying around with various parameters. I poured coffee with my DF64 set to 65 initially, which was very nice. I then lowered it to 60, was a bit too malty for me, then went up to 70 and something miraculous happened - I tasted new flavors I didn't taste before. Suddenly there was a very pleasant fine acidity in the cup while still retaining the sweetness from 65. 

I wanted more of that and went to 75 but then it lost body and tasted flat. So I lowered it a bit to 72 and nailed it perfectly. But still, I'm 7 steps coarser to what I was initially, which in espresso terms is a world between on the DF64. Never thought this would make such a huge positive difference.

On a side note, for V60 I will stop listening to only James because he advises for rather fine grinds and stick to Lance, who grinds coarse. For my taste buds that's a much more enjoyable experience. But then, it got even better when I increased temperature from 95° to 100° C (which was around 98° after rinsing, 93° when I finished the pour), which, funny enough, is a recommendation from James.

Bottom line, if someone asks for dialing in help, for the love of the bean, advise them to grind coarser ;)",0,1769082895.0,pourover,5,0.33,False

I’m an avid Litrpg reader (numbers must go up!!!) and a big fan of stories about corporate overreach and dystopian systems, like Cyberdreams or Outrun. I’ve always wanted to try my own take on that, and that’s how Hoqalo was born.

The world is dystopian and heavily corporatized: brutal taxes, up to 16h workdays, invasive ads everywhere, and corpos constantly trying to squeeze you dry. But instead of grimdark despair, the characters choose something different: optimism, resistance, and helping each other.

Unintentionally, it ended up very close to hopepunk:  
You live under a sol-system–spanning oligarchy whose CEOs exploits you… but you smile anyway, fight back where you can, protect your friends, and try to make the world just a little better.

**Royal Road link:** [https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/145681/hoqalo-the-broken-system](https://www.royalroad.com/fiction/145681/hoqalo-the-broken-system)

**Synopsis:**

**Someone’s been drinking my future like it’s corp-subsidized coffee. I’m about to make them choke on it.**

I’m Dash. My great-grandfather was one of the Fifteen who saved humanity during the System Apocalypse, founding the corps that rule the solar system. That legacy should’ve been mine. Until my father was disinherited and died, leaving me with nothing but a single building on Earth 2.0.

I thought my system compatibility was over 80%. High enough to manifest a system. But they measured me at System Prep School with 17%. Failure, incompatible and the system never came. While my classmates leveled up at System Academy, I got shipped to mining school… fighting bugs for mineral system drops.

Then I nearly died, and a broken system manifested. Barely functional, but enough to show the truth: a rival corp has been draining me this whole time. 17% was a lie. It was a theft.

The system gave me one thing: Hoqalo, a tinkerer’s trait that lets me forge gear better than anything factory-made. It’s not enough to fight a corp hungry enough to drain a Kallum bloodline, but it’s a start.

My corpo grandmother’s resources come with strings attached, but I’ve got my hands, my tools, and friends who will go to corpo hell and back with me.

They stole my future. Time to steal it back with interest.

1qjsdqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1qjsdqe/method_how_i_went_from_exhausted_and_burnt_out_to/,[METHOD] How I went from exhausted and burnt out to fully focused in 2 months,"Hi everyone, I wanted to share my journey of getting control over my focus, energy, and work life balance. I hope you take something useful from this :). I should mention I’m not a native English speaker, so forgive any grammar mistakes.

**TL;DR:** Build focus and anti burnout habits on a foundation of consistency and small wins, not motivation.



# Step 1: Recognize the burnout

It all started when I realized I had been on autopilot for years. I would work for hours, scroll TikTok or YouTube in between tasks, drink too much coffee to stay awake, skip meals, and collapse into bed at night, only to repeat it the next day. Weekends weren’t much better just catching up on sleep and mindless scrolling.

I didn’t even feel *tired* all the time. I was just… drained without knowing it. My brain had gotten so used to constant overstimulation and poor focus that being “slightly productive” felt normal.

I didn’t have depression or anything, but I had **no mental clarity, no flow, and no energy to pursue anything meaningful**. That’s when I knew I had to change.



# Step 2: Build habits on small, consistent actions

I learned that you can’t rely on motivation it’s inconsistent. Instead, you need **tiny, doable habits** built on willpower and consistency.

For example:

* Instead of committing to a 2-hour focus session, I started with **just 10 minutes of undistracted work**.
* Instead of meditating for 20 minutes, I started with **1 minute daily**.
* Instead of a full workout, I started with **1 pushup a day**.

The magic is that once you start, you usually do *more than the minimum*. That small “forced” start breaks the inertia and builds momentum. Over time, 10 minutes turns into an hour, 1 pushup turns into 20, and 1 minute of meditation turns into 20.



# Step 3: Track your energy & focus

I started journaling using a simple daily log:

* **Left page:** My planned tasks and goals (optional).
* **Right page:** A record of activities with their **impact on my energy/focus**:

Example:

* ✅ 6am – Wake up on time
* ✅ 6:30am – Cold shower & meditation
* ❌ 9am – Scrolled Instagram for 30 minutes
* ✅ 10am – Completed focused work session
* ❌ 3pm – Drank energy drinks, felt jittery but unfocused

Color coding gave me instant feedback. Seeing so many ❌ activities was motivating—it helped me deliberately replace them with ✅ activities that increase focus and prevent burnout.



# Step 4: Reduce overstimulation & restore natural dopamine

One big realization was **high dopamine activities** (social media, junk food, endless notifications) were hijacking my brain. They weren’t giving me pleasure they were **draining my motivation**.

I started to:

* Limit TikTok, YouTube, and news scrolling to short, intentional sessions.
* Stop mindlessly snacking and drinking coffee to artificially boost energy.
* Replace high-dopamine habits with **flow activities** tasks that require focus and give satisfaction (coding, writing, learning a skill, exercise).

This gradually restored my natural ability to focus and enjoy tasks without burning out.



# Step 5: Use flow to maximize productivity

I read *Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience* and it completely changed my approach.

Flow happens when your **skill matches the challenge** of the task. Too easy = boredom. Too hard = anxiety.

I started designing my work and learning sessions to hit that sweet spot: challenging enough to engage me fully, but achievable enough to stay confident.

For example:

* Coding small projects instead of randomly browsing Stack Overflow.
* Learning a new topic in 25-minute chunks instead of 2-hour cramming sessions.
* Practicing guitar in focused, playful 10-minute sessions instead of “I must master this now.”

The difference? I felt **alive, engaged, and energized** rather than drained.



# Step 6: Fix your sleep & energy foundation

Nothing supports focus like **good sleep, hydration, and nutrition**. I implemented:

* Wake up consistently between 6–7am
* Stop screens by 9:30pm, sleep by 10pm
* Eat balanced meals and hydrate regularly
* Short walks/exercise to reset energy

I also noticed that **even small adjustments**, like getting sunlight in the morning or a 5-minute stretch every hour, massively improved my ability to focus and resist burnout.



# Step 7: Daily reflection & journaling

I keep journaling as my “free coach”:

* Track what drained me vs. what fueled me
* Adjust my environment to minimize distractions
* Set small micro-goals and celebrate wins

This process alone gave me clarity about my energy patterns, focus triggers, and burnout risks.



# Step 8: Key takeaways

1. Build **tiny, consistent habits**, not massive motivational bursts.
2. Track your activities and energy feedback drives progress.
3. Reduce high-dopamine overstimulation to restore focus naturally.
4. Design tasks for **flow**, not just busyness.
5. Prioritize sleep, nutrition, and light movement to support mental energy.
6. Reflection and journaling = your personal accountability coach.



This post got longer than I expected, but I hope it helps you see that burnout and poor focus can be reversed **in just 2 months with small, consistent changes**. It’s not magic it’s awareness, tracking, and deliberate habit-building.

Outdoor living is not about having a patio and some furniture anymore. These days, people who own homes want to be able to use their spaces in lots of different ways. They want these spaces to look good and to be comfortable, no matter what the weather is like. A [***Pergola with Movable Louvers***](https://luxepergola.com/custom-louvered-pergolas/) is a great example of this. Pergolas with louvres are really popular because they can be changed to suit the weather and how people are feeling. This means that people can use their spaces all year round, and that is really nice. Pergolas, with louvers are changing the way people think about outdoor living.

Movable louvre systems are really different from fixed-roof pergolas. They let people who own homes decide how much sunlight and air they want. If you want to sit in the sun and have a cup of coffee in the morning, you can do that. If you want to be in the shade when it's really hot in the afternoon, you can do that too. Movable louvre systems make it easy to control these things.

This is a reason why architects, designers and people who own homes really like movable louvre systems. They like that they can control the sunlight and the shade and the air, with louvre systems. Movable louver systems are a trend right now.

People really like these things because they help make indoor and outdoor living feel like one thing. Nowadays, homes are getting open inside and outdoor spaces are becoming a real part of the house. A nice pergola can make patio areas by the pool, rooftops, and gardens look better. It also looks good with the house.

Louvered pergolas are great for homes that have a style. They have lines, aluminum and you can pick the colour you want. This makes them look really good, with homes. Louvered pergolas are a choice because they are simple and look nice with the clean style of modern homes.

Technology is really changing the way we do things. A lot of people who own homes now want things for their yards that work with the other smart stuff in their houses. You can get sensors that check the weather, and you can use a remote control or an app on your phone to make the louvers move on their own when it is sunny, windy, or rainy. This is really cool. It is one of the reasons why people are buying more pergolas with motorised louvres. The [***Pergola with Motorized Louvers***](https://luxepergola.com/) is very convenient. It is a luxury item that a lot of people want.

Pergolas with louvers are really popular for outdoor design in 2026 and one of the main reasons is durability. These pergolas are usually made from powder-coated aluminum which's very strong. The aluminum does not get rusty or faded or bent out of shape easily. This makes pergolas with louvers perfect for places that are very hot or very humid.

Pergolas with louvers are much better than wooden pergolas because they do not need to be fixed all the time. Wooden pergolas need a lot of work to keep them looking good. Pergolas with adjustable louvers can last for a very long time, and you do not have to do much to take care of them. Pergolas, with louvers are a great choice if you want something that will last.

Commercial spaces are also helping to make this trend popular. Places like restaurants and cafés and hotels are putting up louvered pergolas. This is so they can have seats outside and still keep their guests comfortable when the weather is bad. The fact that these pergolas can be adjusted quickly is a big help to businesses. They can stay open. Still look nice even when the weather is not good. Commercial spaces, like these are using louvered pergolas to make sure they can still be used when it is raining or really sunny.

Sustainability is really important to people now. One thing that helps with this is louvers. They make buildings energy efficient. This happens because they reduce the heat that comes in through windows and doors.

These louvers are a way to control the climate inside. They help cut down on cooling costs. At the time, they make the place feel more comfortable. Adjustable louvers are a way to do this. They really help with sustainability and energy efficiency.

The pergolas with louvers that are becoming popular in 2026 are not a surprise. Pergolas with louvers have a great mix of style, technology, comfort, and they last a long time. This is what people need nowadays. People can use pergolas with louvers to relax at home or for businesses to make outdoor spaces better. Pergolas with louvers are the future of outdoor living. They are flexible. Look nice. Pergolas, with louvers are also very smart.

**Call to Action**

If you are planning to upgrade your patio or backyard, now is the time to think about getting a custom pergola. You should talk to an installer or someone who is really good at designing outdoor spaces. They can show you how a movable louver pergola can make your patio or backyard a place to be all year round. A custom pergola can be really nice. A movable louver pergola is a good option to consider for your patio or backyard.",1,1769082147.0,u_luxepergola,0,1.0,False

Lately, I’ve been thinking about how rare slow conversations have become. I’ve always been drawn to that pace. Maybe it comes from growing up watching stories where letters meant something, where words were chosen and waited for.

I have a good circle of friends, but I still believe some conversations belong outside our daily lives - quieter, more reflective, written instead of spoken. I enjoy writing with intention, even when I don’t yet know who’s on the other side.

I love books that linger (Daphne du Maurier, the Brontës, Jane Austen, Wilkie Collins, Khaled Hosseini), old Hindi music, coffee, and painting bright, detailed pieces inspired by nature and small moments. I’m not much of a movie person, but thoughtful dramas (like Zindagi Gulzar Hai, Yeh Un Dinon Ki Baat Hai) have my heart.

Not explicitly looking for anything - just curious if anyone else here enjoys slow, sincere exchanges and the idea of getting to know a stranger gently, over time.

She moved away halfway through high school, and I moved even further away for my studies. So it's like we don't exist for each other anymore, and I'm no longer in contact with our mutual friends either. 

Since our relationship ended without us having officially broken up, I never really know what to say about this situation. I tend to say I have a long-distance girlfriend, but that's not really it, actually.

 get to the main topic, I just received a message from a man (23?) with whom I played board games at a party organized by my student residence.

He says that we got along well and suggests going for a coffee together. A relationship situation where I am no longer in that relationship makes me unsure whether I should accept this date.   I'm talking about a date because there's a possibility he's doing it with romantic intentions and I don't want to find myself in a situation where I've been playing him.

Basically, I'm in a situation where I feel like I'm going to be stuck forever with a relationship that ended simply because I don't know what to do.

6. My skin has actually gotten worse, though this might partially be caused by recent cold medicine (I currently have a cold).

1qjs5bx,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1qjs5bx/the_hallway_walker/,The Hallway Walker,"Hi! This is a true story and I thought it would fit in here. 

My sister, her boyfriend, and I had a shared experience on New Year's Day 2018.
​New Year's Day started for me like it does for many others. Extremely hungover, a bit of anxiety, and a level of exhaustion that is hard to describe. What made me feel worst was probably the fact that a buddy and I decided to walk home from the New Year's party instead of staying over. If it had been a short distance, it would have been fine. But we walked about 8km while completely wasted. I do not recommend making that mistake. It took about 4 hours. But other than that, it was a successful New Year's and the walk was actually fun in the moment.

​So, I’m lying there in my last childhood room in my parents' house. I am woken up by a whimpering sound. I wake up, still a bit tipsy, thinking ""What is going on?"" I look down at the side of the bed and it takes a few seconds to register what I’m seeing and hearing. It’s Albin, our family dog! He wanted to go out. I think ""Damn, that’s right. My parents and sister aren't home, I have to take him out.""

 I jump out of bed, put on my clothes, and head out. That feeling in your body when you have to rush up while being seriously hungover is not pleasant. But back then, when I was younger, that feeling usually faded quite quickly.
​I remember thinking at the start of the walk that it was absolutely freezing. It was that typical West Coast winter, ice winds, grey, wet, and icy roads. A gust of wind made your face and hands go numb. One wrong step and you’d fall flat on your ass. The thermometer said 0° but with those winds, it felt like -10°. But it was actually refreshing to get out and walk with the little dog. My best friend. He was a Puli, for those wondering.

​We come back inside and Albin is so happy and playful. I rile him up even more. That was the best thing I knew, making him ""riled up."" We play-fought and messed around a lot. He loved it too. I miss that little rascal! After a while, I give him a chew bone so he settles down. I went back to bed in my room.
​This isn't the same room I had in my previous story about the fisherman, but this one is also next to the hallway. If you look out from my current room, you see my old room diagonally to the left. Between these rooms stands the archway to the hall. My sister and her boyfriend are currently using my old room. They are living there temporarily while moving between apartments.

​I fall back asleep. It was probably 08:00 when I went back to bed and I woke up again around 12:00 or 13:00. I get up, put on some coffee, and make breakfast. I go down to the living room and sit down to watch some TV while I eat. The living room is one step down in a single story house with a very open floor plan. The only room you can't see from the living room is the hallway and our two bathrooms located there. I have never liked the passage from the living room to the hallway. You get a feeling that someone is walking behind you. You feel a presence in your spine, like something is almost on your back. Breathing down your neck. Almost like they have their face right over your shoulder. The hair on your neck stands up and you get an extremely noticeable surge of stress.

​I have recurring nightmares about that passage between those two rooms. The dreams always consist of me going down to the living room and some kind of entity is there, shocked that I’ve come down. I freeze, my whole body cramps. I start hyperventilating and want to cry from fear. My eyes wide, filling with tears. I try to scream but it doesn't work. I can't scream, it’s like there is a blockage in my throat. The only thing that comes out is a weak, forced ""uughh.""
​The entity becomes almost excited. It’s happy to see me. But not in a ""nice to see you"" way. More like it has been waiting for me for a very long time. It has sat down there for years just to finally reach me and take me. It starts to smile, its eyes become like ping pong balls and then it starts screaming uncontrollably. It often takes the form of a pale girl with unkempt, medium length dark hair. Her clothes are worn, almost as if she has worn the same clothes for years.
​I feel instantly that this creature is going to kill me and I have to run now. So I run. I run toward the hallway to get out and then that feeling comes. She is behind me, breathing down my neck, screaming in my ear, a hysterical and manic scream.
​I always managed to get out through the door. I hold the door shut so she can't get out. I can see her deformed silhouette through the blurry glass of the front door, how she moves frantically trying to open it. I can't hear her anymore except for her fast stomping on the floor. Again, I try to scream but I still can't. My heart is racing at 120km/h, I’m sweating, my hair is standing up all over my body and I think ""it's over. She will take me. It's done.""
​Then I wake up, drenched in sweat. Filled with adrenaline. I am terrified and try to convince myself it was just a dream. It often takes a long time before I calm down after those dreams.

​Now, I got a bit sidetracked there, let’s go back to what I was talking about before. Albin comes over and begs for food like he always did. I gave him a piece of my sandwich and that was that. You shouldn't give dogs too much food, but I get very soft when he stares at me with those puppy eyes and makes little gestures with his front paws.

​Once I finished eating, I let him out on the lawn. My parents have a very large fenced in lawn for Albin. I let him back in and after that, I just lie on the couch until my sister and her boyfriend come home later in the afternoon after their New Year's celebrations.
​When they got home it was already dark, which isn't strange here in Sweden. It gets light at 09:00 and dark again at 15:30 during the worst part of winter. Summer is the opposite, then it's light almost twenty four hours a day.

​Anyway, they come home and it was actually quite nice. We greet each other and ask how our New Year's Eve was. My sister and I had a very rivalrous upbringing where we fought constantly and couldn't stand each other at all. We fought over the smallest things and she always made comments toward me and I did the same to her. You know, sibling love. But it was around this time that things started to change.

​After all the talking, my sister took Albin for a walk. Her boyfriend and I sat on the couch chilling and we had a beer each. You could do that the day after back in those days. My sister came back and sat with us. Albin joined in too, he was always on the couch especially if everyone was gathered there.
​It was always nice when he jumped up on the couch because then you could see him. Otherwise, if he lay on the rug, you couldn't see him because the rug was black and shaggy and he was also black and shaggy. So you always had a bit of stress when you were about to stand up from the couch when he was on the rug. The living room was always quite dark. There was no strong lighting.
​We sit there and watch some movie. We talk and have a generally pleasant time together.

My sister was pregnant then with their first son. She had shared the news on Christmas Eve a week prior, so she didn't drink any beer, which was for the best.
​But it was quite early in the pregnancy so she was probably pretty tired. Her boyfriend and I were too after the New Year's party. As it approached 22:00 or 23:00, we decided it was time to go to bed. I always felt much better sleeping there knowing others were in the house too. It felt safer.

​When we all had brushed our teeth and said goodnight, we went to our rooms. I had started some YouTube video to fall asleep to. I hadn't quite fallen asleep yet when I hear someone starting to walk up the stairs to the front door. Someone walks up the stairs, opens the door, closes it, and walks in. Albin starts barking frantically and runs to the door. He stops as soon as he reaches the hallway. 

The silence was unbearable. You could almost hear your heart pounding. It was as if a cold wind went right through you.
​I felt surprised and a bit scared because I knew my parents were in Spain and weren't coming back for a couple of days. I heard my sister and her boyfriend getting out of bed. They had heard what happened in the hall.
​But I got a sudden feeling that it wasn't a person coming in. I got that dark feeling I had when I heard the footsteps in the hall when I was younger. A raw, angry feeling. Something tells me ""you do not go out there no matter what happens."" I feel my blood start rushing, the adrenaline pumping, I get a lump in my throat and my eyes strain. My neck, jaw, and shoulders tense up all at once and my stomach tingles with anxiety. My chest felt like it was going to explode. I thought ""But what if it's a burglar or something? Am I going to leave my sister's boyfriend to handle it himself if someone is actually there?"" No, I wouldn't. Beyond that, I thought ""What if the person hurts Albin?"" And that thought made me very upset.

​Both my sister's boyfriend and I jump up, open our bedroom doors at the same time, peek our heads out and look at each other. It felt almost like a scene from Scooby Doo, a bit comical. I check on Albin quickly and see that he is just as confused as we are. But I also saw that he was okay and unharmed, which was a big relief.

​I ask ""Did someone come in? Was it one of you?"" He answers ""No, we haven't been up late, we went to bed.""
​We rush out to the hallway, check the bathrooms to see if anyone was there. We each took a bathroom. I turn on the outdoor lights, then fast as hell we run out onto the porch with the flashlights on our phones. The outdoor lighting was very limited in the pitch black and freezing January darkness. The sky was starry now, the grey clouds from earlier were gone. The cold gripped me as if it were going to hold me hostage. Every breath felt like inhaling sharp needles made of ice.

​The way the front of the house looks, there is a garage straight ahead and bricks as a walking surface between the porch and the garage. That is the first thing you see when you come out. Then there is a parking area to the right and the big lawn where I let Albin out earlier to the left of the garage. There is a large fence between the parking area and the bricks to create privacy. The same applied to the lawn, where there were large thick bushes separating the lawn from the bricks in the front.

​We go down the stairs, out to the parking area, and out onto the lawn. We look everywhere but no one is there. Now you might think the intruder had time to run away. To that I say no. From the moment we heard the person enter, it went very fast until we were outside checking. It was a matter of seconds, maybe a minute at most.

​But we search and search. We find nothing out there either. We look at each other with confused glances and I say ""What the hell just happened? How can the door just open? We heard someone physically walk in?"" He answers ""I have no idea. There must be a logical explanation for this. This is insane."" My sister comes out too and asks what’s going on and if we found anyone.
​We try to come up with explanations for a long time. We bounce thoughts back and forth. But it ends with my sister's boyfriend being skeptical of my explanation about the supernatural, thinking there must be a logical explanation. But my sister and I were quite sure about what happened. Because this wasn't the first time this had happened. For us, yes, it was the first time. But my mom and dad have had several experiences with this phenomenon that they have told us about afterward.

​Sometimes when one of them comes home from work before the other, they might be in the kitchen fixing food. Then they hear someone come in through the front door. They call out ""Hello! Are you home so early today?"" only to get silence in return. Albin runs to the door, barking, as he always does when someone comes home. But the same thing happens again. He runs there and goes completely silent. They go to the hall to see who it was, only to find that no one has come home.

​So, I have no logical explanation for this. If this had been a one time thing, I might have accepted that someone tried to break in. But this has happened multiple times, either in the evening or when someone comes home from work. It feels like if it were a burglar, they’re doing a really bad job if they think it's a good idea to break in when people are finishing work or when most people are awake watching TV.

​The events have calmed down now that my parents finally replaced the old door with a modern one that has an automatic lock. I haven't heard anything from them regarding the ""hallway walker"" for a while at least. I’ll have to ask them next time I visit. They can be bad at sharing these things sometimes.

I a few weeks ago I went to the doctor's office once. The doctor was very pretty and interesting woman. Besides business conversation trailed off a little bit, we talked about cats and other stuff. Before I left, she gave me her number to send her blood tests and stuff - pretty standard practice here where I live.

I decided to take my chance and again to steer off from formal conversion in texts, which she didn't seem to mind. She revealed she is 42. I was not shocked; it was pretty much what I expected. I'm curious, but also a bit apprehensive. I never dated someone 12 years senior but had a couple of one-time things in the past. Who knows, it could be a one-time thing too, but if it's not how do I approach it? I will visit her workplace tomorrow to have some coffee. She says all of this is very unusual to her and she barely ever interacted with someone outside of medicine.

To be completely honest, I am also wary of the reaction I could get from others, especially from my close ones, because it's uncommon to date a woman who is 12 years senor. What are your experiences, kings? And queens are welcome too, of course.",0,1769081283.0,AskMenAdvice,36,0.33,False

This call is the reason I resigned and checked myself into a psychiatric ward.,"​The night was typical for a suburban Oregon shift—oppressively quiet. At 4:12 AM, the console lit up. I picked up, expecting a drunk driver or a silent pocket dial. Instead, I heard a child’s voice. He couldn't have been more than six, and he was calm. Too calm.

​""911, what is your emergency?"" I asked.
​""Hi. Can you wake my daddy up? He refuses to wake up.""

​I felt that familiar tug of professional concern. ""Okay, buddy, stay with me. Where is your daddy right now?""

​""He’s in the kitchen. He tried to make dinner, but he tripped and fell. Now he’s filling the floor with red paint.""

​My blood ran cold. ""Red paint? Do you mean blood? Listen to me carefully, is there a knife near him?""

​""No. No knives. The Tall Man who lives in my closet helped him sleep. He only used his hands.""

​I started tracing the call, my fingers flying across the keyboard. ""A tall man? Is he in the house right now?""

​""Yes. He’s standing right behind me. He says you talk too much, Mark.""

​I froze. My name wasn't on the caller ID. ""How do you know my name?""

​""He says he knows you well. He says you forgot to lock your bedroom window before you left for work today. He’s looking at Emma while she sleeps right now.""

​I lost my professional composure. I was screaming into the headset. ""What are you talking about?! Who is this?! Who is that man?!""

​The child’s voice shifted. It dropped several octaves, becoming a guttural, distorted rasp that didn't sound human. ""Don’t worry, Mark. I’ll make her sleep deeply. Just like this father.""

​The line went dead. I abandoned my station, ignored my supervisor, and drove like a maniac toward my house with a fleet of cruisers behind me. When I arrived, the house was silent. I burst into Emma’s room, heart hammering against my ribs. She was there, tucked in, breathing peacefully. I collapsed on the floor, sobbing with relief, thinking it was a sick, elaborate prank.

​But then I reached out to stroke her hair, and I saw it. Tucked under her pillow was a baby monitor. It was active. And coming through the speaker was my own voice, recorded from the office five minutes ago: ""911, what is your emergency?""

​The police investigation broke me. The call hadn't come from my home phone. It came from a high-frequency transmitter embedded inside the drywall of my daughter's room. Someone had been living inside the walls for months. They had carved out a nest made of my daughter's old clothes and hundreds of candid photos of me sleeping, taken through the air vents.
​They found a recorder with thousands of hours of my 911 shifts. The intruder had been studying my voice, my patterns, and my life. But the detail that sent me to the ward was the DNA they found in that crawlspace. It matched mine perfectly—but it was the DNA of a child. As if a version of me had stopped growing and stayed in the dark, waiting.
✦✦✦
​I moved to a different state. I changed my name. Emma stopped speaking entirely; she just stares at the walls and smiles. A week ago, in a city where nobody knows us, my phone rang. Private number.

​I answered, my hand shaking. I heard a recording of myself from years ago: ""911, what is your emergency?"" 

​Then, a child’s giggle whispered: ""We found another open window, Mark. And this time, Emma opened it for us.""

​I looked up. Emma was standing in the kitchen doorway, holding a steak knife. She looked at me with a hollow grin and said, ""Daddy, The Tall Man says the red paint tastes much better than coffee.""

​I’m writing this from a reinforced room in a facility. They say I had a breakdown and hurt my own family. But I know the truth. The call never ended. I can still hear the static in my ears, and I can hear the scratching coming from inside the hospital walls.",10,1769081277.0,nosleep,0,0.92,False

Please let me know if you have any feedback!

# CHAPTER 1: THE BUTCHER’S WILL

The iron gates of the Vane estate groan as they swing open, the sound like a dying man’s last breath. The hinges are rusted, neglected by a father who cared more for the power held within these walls than the upkeep of the walls themselves. I grip the steering wheel of my worn sedan until my knuckles turn white, the cheap leather peeling under my touch. Every crack in the steering wheel feels like a reminder of the life I tried to build, one made of honest sweat and double shifts at a diner.

I don’t belong here anymore. I’ve spent five years scrubbing the scent of gunpowder and expensive cologne from my skin, working in a city that doesn’t know my name. I traded silk for polyester and champagne for bitter coffee, thinking that if I made myself small enough, the world of the Vane Syndicate would forget I existed.

But you can’t run from a ghost, especially when that ghost is Lorenzo Vane.

As I drive up the long gravel driveway, the grey stone estate looms over me, a massive, stubborn wall of rock that cuts the world in two. To the world, my father was a philanthropist and a pillar of the community. To me, he was the man who taught me that love is just another word for leverage. He used to say that every person has a price, and if you cannot find it, you simply are not looking hard enough.

Now he is dead. One shot to the heart was enough to kill him, but not enough to break the hold he has on my life, even from the grave.

The scent of lilies hits me the moment I step into the foyer, but the air is heavy with the smell of death, and my stomach turns as a wave of nausea hits me. To anyone else, they smell like a funeral, but they just remind me of my father’s lies.

""The library, Miss Elara,"" a servant whispers, keeping his eyes firmly fixed on the floor. I don’t recognize him. My father’s old staff has likely been swept away the moment the blood was dry on the carpet.

I walk toward the high velvet chairs of the library, my spine as rigid as the mahogany shelves surrounding me. I pass the portraits of my ancestors, men with hard eyes and hidden hands, and I feel like an intruder in a museum of my own trauma, like a trespasser in my own house. My uncle Arthur is already there, standing by the window with a glass of scotch in his hand, despite it being barely noon. He looks older than I remember, his face puffy from the years spent as a footnote in my father’s legacy.

""You’re late,"" Arthur says, not bothering to turn around. The ice clinks against the crystal glass, a rhythmic sound that sets my teeth on edge.

""I’m here, aren’t I?"" I sit down, smoothing the fabric of my black dress. ""Let’s get this over with. Read the will so I can get back to a life that doesn’t involve you."" I want to be back in my cramped apartment by nightfall, surrounded by the hum of the city and the anonymity that felt so much like safety.

Arthur turns with a bitter smile on his face. ""Patience, Elara. We’re waiting for the guest of honor."" ""Guest of honor?"" I narrow my eyes. ""The lawyers said this was a family matter.""

""Plans change,"" an unfamiliar voice rumbles. The voice is deep and resonant, a bass that seems to vibrate the very air in my lungs

The heavy oak doors creak open, and the temperature in the room seems to drop ten degrees. My breath hitches. I don’t need to look up to know who it is. I can feel him. A dark and suffocating pressure fills every corner of the room, stealing the oxygen until my lungs burn.

Silas Moretti.

He doesn’t walk. He prowls. He is dressed in a charcoal suit that costs more than my apartment in the city, but no amount of tailoring can hide the predator beneath. The fabric strains against his broad shoulders, and there is a lethal grace to his movements that suggests he is always ready for a fight. His hair is dark, his jawline sharp enough to draw blood, and his eyes are the color of a winter sea just before a storm. Cold. Deep. Fatal. I stare at the man who likely murdered my father, searching for a flicker of guilt in his eyes.

Silas doesn’t acknowledge my uncle. He doesn't acknowledge the trembling lawyer in the corner. He walks straight toward me and stops so close I can smell him: expensive tobacco, cedarwood, and the faint, metallic tang of something dangerous.

""Elara Vane,"" he murmurs. He doesn’t say it as a greeting; he says it like a sentence.

""Moretti,"" I spit, forcing myself to look him in the eye. I will not be the weak girl he remembers from the galas, the one who hid behind her father’s long coat. My heart is hammering against my ribs, but I won’t let him see the fear.

I will not be the first to blink. ""I’m surprised you haven’t burned this house down yet. Isn't that what Morettis do? Destroy what you can’t own?"" I want him to know that I see him. I want him to know that I know what he did in the dark of that office three months ago. The Moretti and Vane families have been at war for decades, a cycle of blood and retaliation that has left both houses fractured.

A ghost of a smirk touches his lips, but it doesn’t reach his eyes. ""The day is young, Little Vane.""

He takes the chair directly opposite mine, leaning back with a terrifying grace. He looks entirely too comfortable in my father's fortress, as if he already knows the combination to every safe in the room. He crosses one long leg over the other, his gaze never leaving my face. It feels like he’s dissecting me, peeling back my skin to see if there is any of my father’s steel underneath.

The lawyer, a small man named Henry Henderson who looks like he wants to disappear into the floorboards, clears his throat. His hands shake as he adjusts his glasses, and he avoids looking at Silas as if the man were a literal sun that would blind him. ""Now that everyone is present, we shall proceed with the reading of the Last Will of Lorenzo Vane.""

The next twenty minutes are a blur of legal jargon. My father’s properties in Italy, the offshore accounts, the legitimate businesses that serve as veils for the blood-soaked reality of the Vane Syndicate. I listen to the names of holding companies and shipping fleets, realizing for the first time just how vast the empire was and how much blood must have been spilled to keep it afloat. Arthur is leaning forward, his eyes greedy, practically salivating at the mention of the shipping docks.

But then, Henderson’s voice falters. He stops, his hand trembling as he turns the final page. He looks at me, then at Silas, a bead of sweat rolling down his temple.

""There is a specific condition regarding the transfer of the Vane Syndicate and its territories,"" Henderson whispers. The silence in the room is so quiet I can hear the distant ticking of a clock that sounds like a countdown.

""Get on with it,"" Silas commands. His voice isn't loud, but it carries the weight of a physical blow. It is the voice of a man who is used to being obeyed without question.

Henderson swallows hard. ""To ensure the peace and the continued prosperity of the Vane name, the entire estate shall be bequeathed to Elara Vane. However,""

The pit in my stomach turns into an abyss. ""However, what?"" I can feel the trap closing, the invisible wires tightening around my throat.

""This inheritance is only valid upon the condition of a union,"" Henderson reads, his voice cracking. ""Elara Vane must wed Silas Moretti within thirty days. If the marriage is not consummated and maintained for a period of one year, the entire Vane empire will be liquidated, the territories surrendered, and the Vane family erased.""

The silence that follows is deafening. I can hear the ticking of the grandfather clock in the hall, each second sounding like a hammer on a nail. My father hasn't left me a legacy. He sold me to the enemy to save his precious empire, proving one last time that I was never a daughter to him, only a bargaining chip.

I look at Silas, expecting shock, or at least a flicker of surprise. Instead, I see a slow, predatory grin spreading across his face. He knows. He knew before I even stepped into this room.

""Well, Little Vane,"" Silas leans forward, his voice a dark, velvet caress. ""It seems you’re my new inheritance."" The way he says the word makes my skin crawl.

I stand up so fast my chair hits the floor with a dull thud. ""I will see you in hell before I wear your ring, Silas. My father doesn't own me anymore, and neither do you.""

Silas stands too, moving with a speed that makes my pulse spike. He steps into my space, invading it until I am forced to tilt my head back to look at him. He is a wall of muscle and menace. He reaches out, and for a second, I think he is going to grab me. Instead, he simply tucks a loose strand of hair behind my ear. His fingers are ice cold, touching just a second too long.

""Then I’ll make sure to have a seat waiting for you in the flames,"" he whispers. ""But you’ll wear the ring, Elara. Because I’d rather watch you burn in my bed than let you walk away with what’s mine. And make no mistake, as of five minutes ago, you are mine.""

I don’t wait for another word. I turn on my heel and bolt for the exit. My heart is hammering against my ribs. I need to get to my car. I need my apartment, my own bed, and the life I built far away from this house. I need to breathe air that doesn't smell like lilies and death.

I burst through the library doors and run toward the front entrance, but I don't make it to the driveway. Two men built like brick walls step into my path. Their expressions are unreadable while their arms are crossed over their chests.

""Move,"" I snap, my voice trembling with a mix of fury and terror. ""I'm going back to the city.""

I feel him lean down until his lips are inches from my ear, the scent of his expensive tobacco and cedarwood intoxicatingly dark.

""You aren't going back to the city, Elara,"" he whispers, his voice a dark, velvet caress. ""The lease on that hovel you called an apartment was terminated an hour ago. You have no home to return to.""

I whirl around, my eyes wide with disbelief. ""You have no right to touch my life!"".

""I have every right written in your father’s blood,"" he says, stepping into the light. He gestures toward the parking lot, where a fleet of black SUVs is waiting. ""Take her to the car,"" he orders the guards, his gaze never leaving mine. ""My wife-to-be needs to get reacquainted with her new reality.""

The guards take my arms before I can protest. They lead me toward the SUV, and as the door locks with a heavy click, I realize I am no longer a person. I am cargo. I look out the window as we pull away from the only life I knew, heading toward a fortress I’ve been taught to fear my entire life.

She didn’t ask. She didn’t need to. Joana had been in the game long enough to recognize when people were carrying weight they couldn’t yet talk about. She’d ask Hale later—over dinner, when the day’s edges had softened and he was more likely to let something slip. For now, she had a job to do.

“Right,” she said, voice crisp but not unkind. “Let’s get this done properly. Two shuttles. Kelly, you’re left seat on Bird Two with Cathy as right seat. Titus, you’re left seat on Bird One with Edward as right seat. Launch moved up—1300 hours now, not 1500. We’ve got less time than we thought, so listen up.”

She tapped the holo-table. Cargo manifests, routing overlays, and hazard sheets bloomed into view—sharp, color-coded, rotating slowly.

“Initial checks first,” Joana continued. “Both crews do a full walk-around together. Start at the pallets: confirm coil housings, diagnostic gear, spare parts, all serialized and sealed. Check tie-downs—double knots, tension verified. Hazard sheets: Class C isotopes in the forward hold, low-radiation, but still marked. Verify containment seals are intact and counters are zeroed. No shortcuts. I want eyes on every strap, every latch.”

She pointed to the routing overlay. “Secondary check—after the walk-around, you’ll run the onboard diagnostics from the cockpit. Power up the nav core, run the pre-flight sequence, confirm thrust vector alignment and fuel load. Cross-check the hazard manifest against the onboard sensors. If anything’s off—even a decimal point out of tolerance—you flag it. No ‘close enough.’ We’re not running a milk route; we’re going deep belt. One glitch out there and you’re on your own until rescue can reach you.”

Kelly and Cathy exchanged a quick glance—professional now, focused. Titus and Edward nodded once each.

Joana met each of their eyes in turn. “I’ve already signed off the manifests and bills of lading. You four sign the final acceptance after your checks. Flight time: seven hours. Routes locked—no deviations. Standard belt transit, evasion protocols if needed. Questions?”

Silence.

Joana gave a small nod. “Good. Walk-around starts now. I’ll be monitoring from here. When you’re done with the secondary checks, ping me for final sign-off.”

She paused, then pointed at the four of them with a wry smile. “You only have a few hours. Get one hour of rack time. Separate racks.” She pointed at Kelly and winked. “Your own racks.”

Kelly’s cheeks flushed. Cathy snorted softly.

Joana’s smile turned mischievous as she looked at Kelly. “Kate has sleeping arrangements made. Two rooms—one for Titus, one for you and Cathy.”

Kelly’s eyes widened slightly. Cathy grinned like she’d just won a bet.

Joana turned to Edward, still smiling. “Russell—I have a package for Kate.” She pointed to a sealed box on the side table. “See she gets it.”

Edward stepped over, peered inside—and laughed low when he saw the bottle of choice bourbon nestled among the padding.

“Joana,” he said, shaking his head, “if we weren’t on duty, I’d hug you for Kate.”

Joana raised an eyebrow, playful. “Russell, you’re dismissed. Give me that hug.”

Edward hesitated half a second, then stepped forward and wrapped her in a quick, gruff hug. Joana hugged him back, then leaned in close and whispered in his ear—too quiet for the others to hear.

“Have fun.”

She pulled back, gave him a knowing wink, and stepped away.

Edward cleared his throat, cheeks faintly pink. “Right. Let’s move.”

The group filed out—shoulder to shoulder, quiet.

Halfway down the corridor toward the flight deck, they rounded a corner and nearly walked into Director Hale.

He looked tired—eyes shadowed—but his voice was steady. “You four. Let’s get some coffee in the hangar break room.”

No one argued.

Hale led the way. The break room was small—steel table, battered chairs, a coffee dispenser that had seen better decades. Hale went straight to it, poured four mugs, handed them out. Everyone else took water.

“Sit,” he said.

They did.

Hale leaned against the counter, cradling his mug, eyes on Titus.

“First off,” he said quietly, “I had no clue what happened with your message to your mom. But yes—” he dropped his voice even lower, glancing at the door—“there are two QEC units involved.”

Kelly and Cathy leaned forward. Edward stayed very still.

Hale continued. “One is here. Titus walked by as he sent his message. No—his mom does not have a QEC.” He looked directly at Titus. “But she has very powerful friends.”

The girls exchanged a glance. Edward could see Hale was giving them the truth they needed—and nothing more.

Hale set his mug down. “It seems this young man’s mom has connections most people don’t. Girls… it should not have happened. And it did not happen. We will not speak of it again. Understood?”

Cathy opened her mouth. “But Uncle Hale—”

“Cathy. Please. Leave it alone. I can’t say anything else at this time. Okay?”

Cathy exhaled through her nose. “Okay.”

Kelly looked at Titus—really looked. She saw honesty in his face, the same quiet steadiness he always carried. She reached across the table, took his hand.

“Maybe one day I’ll talk to your mom,” she said softly. “And until that day… it stays here.”

Titus squeezed her fingers. “Yeah.”

Hale straightened. “Let’s hit the deck and check your shuttles. Then get some rack time. Joana moved up the launch—1300 now. No time to waste.”

Edward pushed off the wall. “Hale… what about Joana?”

Hale’s smile was small, tired. “Just the basics if she asks. I’ll get some wine tonight—make up for this morning.”

He clapped Edward on the shoulder as he passed. “See you on the deck.”

Hale headed back toward his office.

The others followed him out—Edward and Titus toward the shuttle bays, Kelly and Cathy falling in step behind.

The station kept turning.

And somewhere in the quiet spaces between duty and secrets, four people carried the weight of something much older than themselves.

Waiting.

Watching.

Wondering what came next

Hale walked the quiet corridors back to his office, the weight of the last hour still pressing on his shoulders. The station’s evening cycle had deepened; amber lights cast long shadows, the hum of life support softer now, almost intimate. He palmed the lock on his door.

It hissed open.

Lady Carol Winfield was already inside—standing near the viewport, hands clasped behind her back, gazing out at the slow turn of stars. She turned as he entered, calm and regal, as though she had every right to be there.

Hale paused for half a heartbeat, then stepped inside and let the door seal behind him. He motioned toward his inner office, holding the door open for her.

“My Lady,” he said quietly. “Please.”

Lady Carol inclined her head. “My Sir Hale, I thank you.”

They entered the inner office. The door slid shut with a soft click.

Hale remained standing. “Lady Carol… how may I assist you?”

She turned to face him fully, eyes steady. Hale “You need to speak with the two young ladies.”

. “Kelly and Cathy.”

“Yes.”

He leaned against the edge of his desk, arms folded. “I already have—briefly. They know something happened. They know I lied to them. But they also know Edward and I are the closest thing they have to uncles. Their parents and I go back decades. Edward’s known them since they were small. I’ve watched them grow up on this station. They trust us. They’ll wait—for now.”

Lady Carol’s expression softened, just a fraction. “What is your impression of the relationship between Titus and Kelly?”

Hale allowed himself a small, genuine smile—the first real one in hours.

“I’ve never seen Kelly look at anyone the way she looks at him,” he said quietly. “Not in all the years I’ve known her. She’s always been guarded—sharp, capable, but careful with her heart. With Titus… it’s different. It happened fast, yes. Too fast, maybe. But I’ve watched young love bloom on this station before. This one feels… steady. Real. I wouldn’t be surprised if it lasted. Many, many years.”

Lady Carol studied him for a long moment. Then she stepped forward and placed another chit on his desk—matte black, identical to the first.

Hale looked down at it, then back at her. “Lady Carol… there is no need for that.”

“I know,” she said softly. “But it is given freely.

Hale’s throat worked. He didn’t touch the chit. Instead he met her eyes.

Then looking at her saying they may need unit one day .

Hale looking into her eyes saying “Kelly looked Titus in the eyes no more than 15 minutes ago ” he said. “She told him—quiet, —‘Maybe one day I’ll talk to your mom.’ And she smiled at him. Not a girl’s smile. A woman’s. The kind that means forever.”

Lady Carol’s expression shifted—something close to wonder, tempered by centuries of careful hope.

“I see,” she murmured.

Hale saying the chit pointing They may need it one day .

She stepped back. Smiling

Again she inclined her head. “Thank you, Sir Hale. For your assistance in this matter.”

Hale nodded once, solemn. “My Lady.”

He palmed the inner door open for her.

Lady Carol stepped through without another word.

The outer door hissed shut behind her.

Hale stood alone in the quiet office for a long moment, staring at the second chit on his desk.

Then he exhaled—slow, steady—and locked it away beside the first.

Whatever came next, he knew one thing for certain.

The Principality’s oldest promise wasn’t just awake.

It was watching.

Day 3: Brussels Belgium, went from Liege to Brussels 1 hour by train, visited la Grande place, the famous monuments, New year celebrations, ate some waffles, at night i went to Anderlecht

Day 4: took a Blablacar to Paris, stopped in Mons for coffee, took 3 hours to get to Paris, at the evening i went to see the seine river, Tour effeil, trocadero place, it was charming

Day 5: a nice french breakfast, tried the tandori chicken sandwich, some crepes, visited the Louvre, Moulain rouge, got lost in the charming Paris's streets

Day 6: my last breakfast in Paris, then took bus to Beauvais airport, flying to Oujda Morocco, arrived at night

Day 7-11: spent it around Oujda Morocco, visiting my friends, living like a local, sitting in 5 cafe shops on average per day, reviving my childhood memories

Day 12: went to Rabat Morocco, the capital city, spent 8 hours that day visiting every monument and corner of the city, the city has changed a lot since my last time there, it was during the AFCON, so i met a lot of football fans around Africa, especially Algerians, saluted lot of them, at night went with my friends to eat dinner in Oudaya

Day 13: Spent the whole day out, meeting lot of old friends, walking around the old medina, eating breakfast in place legza sitting next to Tunisians, Algerians, and many nationalities that were playing the AFCON in that period, ended the day having dinner with my friends, occupying half of the cafe's terrace

Day 14-15: woke up in Casablanca Morocco, walked around the city, visited the big mosque, Ain diab, and spent the night in Maarif watching people celebrating like Crazy over the win of Morocco vs Cameroun, met many friends

Day 16: went back to Rabat by train (1 hour), visited the city center, ate lunch with some friends, waited for the evening to take some amazing pictures of the grand theatre and Mohamed 6 tower, then took cab to get to the airport and end my trip. 

The average i was spending per day including flights was 77€/day, of course because in europe i was staying at my friends's place, and in Morocco airbnb was cheap, excluding flights it becomes 65€/day

The whole trip i think costed me around 1400-1500€, which is really good better than my previous trips where i was spending over 2k just in a single country

The food in Belgium and Germany on terms of prices was the same, but France had the cheapest fast food i ever seen in Europe, but the average restaurants are a bit high than average, the food in Morocco is so cheap, airbnb costs what a hostel costs in europe",2,1769081205.0,travel,1,0.75,False

firstly after uninstalling all social media apps it was weird not having my morning routine of coffee and doom scrolling reels on social media, now I fill my morning time with reading the news which I think is better mentally as at least I'm reading and not getting dopamine hits from 30 second videos.

I've been a lot more proactive working out more sticking to a schedule and staying consistent, this has never happened before.

Been finding jobs to do around the house to fill my time because I'm not just doom scrolling anymore so far I've kept on top of all cleaning, tiled my bathroom and painted every room in the house, honestly don't think I would've done this if I could just scroll my time away.

my little MP3 player has been so great as well compelled over 400 of my fav song on there and guess what no adds no subscription completely free!

I've actually been watching full movies and shows usually id start a movie then pick up my phone and doom scroll missing most the movie, it's nice actually being focused on what's going on.

Started volunteering at my local charity shop as well which has been great all the staff are lovely and so are the customers, this is just till I find a job god the job market in my area is difficult.

all in all unplugging from all the social media, subscriptions and doom scrolling is having a positive impact especially on my sleep!!

who else has unplugged this year what's been most difficult for you? what positive changes have you noticed ?",30,1769081127.0,Millennials,28,0.92,False

I want to do a 7-day fast but I do find it hard to stick to fasting.

There's always some reason or another why I break it. Food that needs using up, etc etc.

Ultimately it's a lack of creativity. I want to be less consumive and more creative.

I have got pears and a couple other foods that need using up but I could freeze things and/or give them to other people or just let them go bad (the horror!) instead of rotting inside of me.

So, I thiiink I'll start tomorrow.

I just need to fill my time productively and \*creatively\*.

Any tips on that are welcomed. Thank you.

1qjryjh,https://i.redd.it/4r6hjrohxveg1.jpeg,Why AI Influencers Have It Wrong From the Beginning,"Hey there, I've been diving deep into the world of AI-generated influencers, and I think most creators are shooting themselves in the foot right from the start. Let me break it down: they're getting trapped in this cycle of producing only SFW (Safe For Work) or mildly sexy content, but when they try to pivot to NSFW (Not Safe For Work) stuff for platforms like Fanvue or OnlyFans, it all falls apart. The big culprit? Face consistency, or rather, the total lack of it—not only inconsistent but also with no private exclusive +18 content, because a lot cannot create this kind of content (because of the restrictions, censored AI tools, and because they don't know about more advanced options or think they're too difficult).

The Common Mistake: Starting with SFW Models

Most AI influencers begin by generating characters using general-purpose or SFW-tuned models like Midjourney, Nano Banana, Seedance's base versions or something fine-tuned for ""realistic portraits"" and ""lifestyle shots."" These models are great for creating Instagram-ready pics—think beach selfies, gym poses, or casual outfits that are sexy but not explicit. You can get a consistent face across a bunch of these images by using simple prompting with seeds and references.

But here's where it goes wrong: when they want to monetize with NSFW content, they switch to explicit models or try to ""uncensor"" their generations. NSFW-specific models (like those fine-tuned on adult datasets) aren't built with the same emphasis on facial detail or consistency as SFW ones. This leads to half-baked galleries on Fanvue: a few decent SFW teasers, then a bunch of inconsistent NSFW shots or non at all! No wonder engagement tanks and subscribers bail—people want a consistent character they can connect with, and they want exclusive hot content.

The Right Way: Build from NSFW Foundations First

Flip the script. Start with an NSFW-capable model as your base for character creation. Models like those trained on a mix of explicit and non-explicit data allow you to generate a core character with rock-solid consistency across all types of content. Here's why this works:

\- Face Consistency Baked In: NSFW models often handle anatomy and poses better out of the gate. Generate your character's ""nude base"" first—focus on poses, lighting, and expressions without clothes. This ensures the face, body proportions, and even skin textures stay identical no matter what you add later. And you have already your exclusive spicy content that makes real money!

\- Branch Out to SFW Seamlessly: Once you have that consistent NSFW core, layering on clothes, backgrounds, and lifestyles is easy. Your influencer can go from bedroom scenes to coffee shop vibes without looking like a different person.

\- Efficiency and Quality Boost: This approach saves time because you're not fighting model biases. SFW models often have built-in censors that make NSFW generations wonky, but starting NSFW lets you dial back explicitness as needed. Plus, you end up with higher-quality content overall—better anatomy means more realistic SFW pics too.

I've experimented with this myself, and the difference is night and day. My test characters maintain high face similarity across hundreds of gens, versus the mess from SFW-first attempts.

Why This Matters for Fanvue and Beyond

Platforms like Fanvue thrive on personalized, immersive content. If your AI influencer looks inconsistent, it breaks the fantasy—fans feel like they're following a glitchy bot, not a ""real"" persona. Starting NSFW-first gives you versatility: killer NSFW for paid subs, engaging SFW for social media growth. It's not just about ethics or tech limits; it's smart business.

1qjrxkk,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1qjrxkk/the_hallway_walker/,The Hallway Walker,"Hi! Now we are back in the hallway again. If you haven't read my previous post, this is also about the hallway in my childhood home. 

My sister, her boyfriend, and I had a shared experience on New Year's Day 2018.
​New Year's Day started for me like it does for many others. Extremely hungover, a bit of anxiety, and a level of exhaustion that is hard to describe. What made me feel worst was probably the fact that a buddy and I decided to walk home from the New Year's party instead of staying over. If it had been a short distance, it would have been fine. But we walked about 8km while completely wasted. I do not recommend making that mistake. It took about 4 hours. But other than that, it was a successful New Year's and the walk was actually fun in the moment.

​So, I’m lying there in my last childhood room in my parents' house. I am woken up by a whimpering sound. I wake up, still a bit tipsy, thinking ""What is going on?"" I look down at the side of the bed and it takes a few seconds to register what I’m seeing and hearing. It’s Albin, our family dog! He wanted to go out. I think ""Damn, that’s right. My parents and sister aren't home, I have to take him out.""

 I jump out of bed, put on my clothes, and head out. That feeling in your body when you have to rush up while being seriously hungover is not pleasant. But back then, when I was younger, that feeling usually faded quite quickly.
​I remember thinking at the start of the walk that it was absolutely freezing. It was that typical West Coast winter, ice winds, grey, wet, and icy roads. A gust of wind made your face and hands go numb. One wrong step and you’d fall flat on your ass. The thermometer said 0° but with those winds, it felt like -10°. But it was actually refreshing to get out and walk with the little dog. My best friend. He was a Puli, for those wondering.

​We come back inside and Albin is so happy and playful. I rile him up even more. That was the best thing I knew, making him ""riled up."" We play-fought and messed around a lot. He loved it too. I miss that little rascal! After a while, I give him a chew bone so he settles down. I went back to bed in my room.
​This isn't the same room I had in my previous story about the fisherman, but this one is also next to the hallway. If you look out from my current room, you see my old room diagonally to the left. Between these rooms stands the archway to the hall. My sister and her boyfriend are currently using my old room. They are living there temporarily while moving between apartments.

​I fall back asleep. It was probably 08:00 when I went back to bed and I woke up again around 12:00 or 13:00. I get up, put on some coffee, and make breakfast. I go down to the living room and sit down to watch some TV while I eat. The living room is one step down in a single story house with a very open floor plan. The only room you can't see from the living room is the hallway and our two bathrooms located there. I have never liked the passage from the living room to the hallway. You get a feeling that someone is walking behind you. You feel a presence in your spine, like something is almost on your back. Breathing down your neck. Almost like they have their face right over your shoulder. The hair on your neck stands up and you get an extremely noticeable surge of stress.

​I have recurring nightmares about that passage between those two rooms. The dreams always consist of me going down to the living room and some kind of entity is there, shocked that I’ve come down. I freeze, my whole body cramps. I start hyperventilating and want to cry from fear. My eyes wide, filling with tears. I try to scream but it doesn't work. I can't scream, it’s like there is a blockage in my throat. The only thing that comes out is a weak, forced ""uughh.""
​The entity becomes almost excited. It’s happy to see me. But not in a ""nice to see you"" way. More like it has been waiting for me for a very long time. It has sat down there for years just to finally reach me and take me. It starts to smile, its eyes become like ping pong balls and then it starts screaming uncontrollably. It often takes the form of a pale girl with unkempt, medium length dark hair. Her clothes are worn, almost as if she has worn the same clothes for years.
​I feel instantly that this creature is going to kill me and I have to run now. So I run. I run toward the hallway to get out and then that feeling comes. She is behind me, breathing down my neck, screaming in my ear, a hysterical and manic scream.
​I always managed to get out through the door. I hold the door shut so she can't get out. I can see her deformed silhouette through the blurry glass of the front door, how she moves frantically trying to open it. I can't hear her anymore except for her fast stomping on the floor. Again, I try to scream but I still can't. My heart is racing at 120km/h, I’m sweating, my hair is standing up all over my body and I think ""it's over. She will take me. It's done.""
​Then I wake up, drenched in sweat. Filled with adrenaline. I am terrified and try to convince myself it was just a dream. It often takes a long time before I calm down after those dreams.

​Now, I got a bit sidetracked there, let’s go back to what I was talking about before. Albin comes over and begs for food like he always did. I gave him a piece of my sandwich and that was that. You shouldn't give dogs too much food, but I get very soft when he stares at me with those puppy eyes and makes little gestures with his front paws.

​Once I finished eating, I let him out on the lawn. My parents have a very large fenced in lawn for Albin. I let him back in and after that, I just lie on the couch until my sister and her boyfriend come home later in the afternoon after their New Year's celebrations.
​When they got home it was already dark, which isn't strange here in Sweden. It gets light at 09:00 and dark again at 15:30 during the worst part of winter. Summer is the opposite, then it's light almost twenty four hours a day.

​Anyway, they come home and it was actually quite nice. We greet each other and ask how our New Year's Eve was. My sister and I had a very rivalrous upbringing where we fought constantly and couldn't stand each other at all. We fought over the smallest things and she always made comments toward me and I did the same to her. You know, sibling love. But it was around this time that things started to change.

​After all the talking, my sister took Albin for a walk. Her boyfriend and I sat on the couch chilling and we had a beer each. You could do that the day after back in those days. My sister came back and sat with us. Albin joined in too, he was always on the couch especially if everyone was gathered there.
​It was always nice when he jumped up on the couch because then you could see him. Otherwise, if he lay on the rug, you couldn't see him because the rug was black and shaggy and he was also black and shaggy. So you always had a bit of stress when you were about to stand up from the couch when he was on the rug. The living room was always quite dark. There was no strong lighting.
​We sit there and watch some movie. We talk and have a generally pleasant time together.

My sister was pregnant then with their first son. She had shared the news on Christmas Eve a week prior, so she didn't drink any beer, which was for the best.
​But it was quite early in the pregnancy so she was probably pretty tired. Her boyfriend and I were too after the New Year's party. As it approached 22:00 or 23:00, we decided it was time to go to bed. I always felt much better sleeping there knowing others were in the house too. It felt safer.

​When we all had brushed our teeth and said goodnight, we went to our rooms. I had started some YouTube video to fall asleep to. I hadn't quite fallen asleep yet when I hear someone starting to walk up the stairs to the front door. Someone walks up the stairs, opens the door, closes it, and walks in. Albin starts barking frantically and runs to the door. He stops as soon as he reaches the hallway. 

The silence was unbearable. You could almost hear your heart pounding. It was as if a cold wind went right through you.
​I felt surprised and a bit scared because I knew my parents were in Spain and weren't coming back for a couple of days. I heard my sister and her boyfriend getting out of bed. They had heard what happened in the hall.
​But I got a sudden feeling that it wasn't a person coming in. I got that dark feeling I had when I heard the footsteps in the hall when I was younger. A raw, angry feeling. Something tells me ""you do not go out there no matter what happens."" I feel my blood start rushing, the adrenaline pumping, I get a lump in my throat and my eyes strain. My neck, jaw, and shoulders tense up all at once and my stomach tingles with anxiety. My chest felt like it was going to explode. I thought ""But what if it's a burglar or something? Am I going to leave my sister's boyfriend to handle it himself if someone is actually there?"" No, I wouldn't. Beyond that, I thought ""What if the person hurts Albin?"" And that thought made me very upset.

​Both my sister's boyfriend and I jump up, open our bedroom doors at the same time, peek our heads out and look at each other. It felt almost like a scene from Scooby Doo, a bit comical. I check on Albin quickly and see that he is just as confused as we are. But I also saw that he was okay and unharmed, which was a big relief.

​I ask ""Did someone come in? Was it one of you?"" He answers ""No, we haven't been up late, we went to bed.""
​We rush out to the hallway, check the bathrooms to see if anyone was there. We each took a bathroom. I turn on the outdoor lights, then fast as hell we run out onto the porch with the flashlights on our phones. The outdoor lighting was very limited in the pitch black and freezing January darkness. The sky was starry now, the grey clouds from earlier were gone. The cold gripped me as if it were going to hold me hostage. Every breath felt like inhaling sharp needles made of ice.

​The way the front of the house looks, there is a garage straight ahead and bricks as a walking surface between the porch and the garage. That is the first thing you see when you come out. Then there is a parking area to the right and the big lawn where I let Albin out earlier to the left of the garage. There is a large fence between the parking area and the bricks to create privacy. The same applied to the lawn, where there were large thick bushes separating the lawn from the bricks in the front.

​We go down the stairs, out to the parking area, and out onto the lawn. We look everywhere but no one is there. Now you might think the intruder had time to run away. To that I say no. From the moment we heard the person enter, it went very fast until we were outside checking. It was a matter of seconds, maybe a minute at most.

​But we search and search. We find nothing out there either. We look at each other with confused glances and I say ""What the hell just happened? How can the door just open? We heard someone physically walk in?"" He answers ""I have no idea. There must be a logical explanation for this. This is insane."" My sister comes out too and asks what’s going on and if we found anyone.
​We try to come up with explanations for a long time. We bounce thoughts back and forth. But it ends with my sister's boyfriend being skeptical of my explanation about the supernatural, thinking there must be a logical explanation. But my sister and I were quite sure about what happened. Because this wasn't the first time this had happened. For us, yes, it was the first time. But my mom and dad have had several experiences with this phenomenon that they have told us about afterward.

​Sometimes when one of them comes home from work before the other, they might be in the kitchen fixing food. Then they hear someone come in through the front door. They call out ""Hello! Are you home so early today?"" only to get silence in return. Albin runs to the door, barking, as he always does when someone comes home. But the same thing happens again. He runs there and goes completely silent. They go to the hall to see who it was, only to find that no one has come home.

​So, I have no logical explanation for this. If this had been a one time thing, I might have accepted that someone tried to break in. But this has happened multiple times, either in the evening or when someone comes home from work. It feels like if it were a burglar, they’re doing a really bad job if they think it's a good idea to break in when people are finishing work or when most people are awake watching TV.

​The events have calmed down now that my parents finally replaced the old door with a modern one that has an automatic lock. I haven't heard anything from them regarding the ""hallway walker"" for a while at least. I’ll have to ask them next time I visit. They can be bad at sharing these things sometimes.

​Anyway, they come home and it was actually quite nice. We greet each other and ask how our New Year's Eve was. My sister and I had a very rivalrous upbringing where we fought constantly and couldn't stand each other at all. We fought over the smallest things and she always made comments toward me and I did the same to her. You know, sibling love. But it was around this time that things started to change.

​After all the talking, my sister took Albin for a walk. Her boyfriend and I sat on the couch chilling and we had a beer each. You could do that the day after back in those days. My sister came back and sat with us. Albin joined in too, he was always on the couch especially if everyone was gathered there.
​It was always nice when he jumped up on the couch because then you could see him. Otherwise, if he lay on the rug, you couldn't see him because the rug was black and shaggy and he was also black and shaggy. So you always had a bit of stress when you were about to stand up from the couch when he was on the rug. The living room was always quite dark. There was no strong lighting.
​We sit there and watch some movie. We talk and have a generally pleasant time together.

My sister was pregnant then with their first son. She had shared the news on Christmas Eve a week prior, so she didn't drink any beer, which was for the best.
​But it was quite early in the pregnancy so she was probably pretty tired. Her boyfriend and I were too after the New Year's party. As it approached 22:00 or 23:00, we decided it was time to go to bed. I always felt much better sleeping there knowing others were in the house too. It felt safer.

​When we all had brushed our teeth and said goodnight, we went to our rooms. I had started some YouTube video to fall asleep to. I hadn't quite fallen asleep yet when I hear someone starting to walk up the stairs to the front door. Someone walks up the stairs, opens the door, closes it, and walks in. Albin starts barking frantically and runs to the door. He stops as soon as he reaches the hallway. 

The silence was unbearable. You could almost hear your heart pounding. It was as if a cold wind went right through you.
​I felt surprised and a bit scared because I knew my parents were in Spain and weren't coming back for a couple of days. I heard my sister and her boyfriend getting out of bed. They had heard what happened in the hall.
​But I got a sudden feeling that it wasn't a person coming in. I got that dark feeling I had when I heard the footsteps in the hall when I was younger. A raw, angry feeling. Something tells me ""you do not go out there no matter what happens."" I feel my blood start rushing, the adrenaline pumping, I get a lump in my throat and my eyes strain. My neck, jaw, and shoulders tense up all at once and my stomach tingles with anxiety. My chest felt like it was going to explode. I thought ""But what if it's a burglar or something? Am I going to leave my sister's boyfriend to handle it himself if someone is actually there?"" No, I wouldn't. Beyond that, I thought ""What if the person hurts Albin?"" And that thought made me very upset.

​Both my sister's boyfriend and I jump up, open our bedroom doors at the same time, peek our heads out and look at each other. It felt almost like a scene from Scooby Doo, a bit comical. I check on Albin quickly and see that he is just as confused as we are. But I also saw that he was okay and unharmed, which was a big relief.

​I ask ""Did someone come in? Was it one of you?"" He answers ""No, we haven't been up late, we went to bed.""
​We rush out to the hallway, check the bathrooms to see if anyone was there. We each took a bathroom. I turn on the outdoor lights, then fast as hell we run out onto the porch with the flashlights on our phones. The outdoor lighting was very limited in the pitch black and freezing January darkness. The sky was starry now, the grey clouds from earlier were gone. The cold gripped me as if it were going to hold me hostage. Every breath felt like inhaling sharp needles made of ice.

​The way the front of the house looks, there is a garage straight ahead and bricks as a walking surface between the porch and the garage. That is the first thing you see when you come out. Then there is a parking area to the right and the big lawn where I let Albin out earlier to the left of the garage. There is a large fence between the parking area and the bricks to create privacy. The same applied to the lawn, where there were large thick bushes separating the lawn from the bricks in the front.

​We go down the stairs, out to the parking area, and out onto the lawn. We look everywhere but no one is there. Now you might think the intruder had time to run away. To that I say no. From the moment we heard the person enter, it went very fast until we were outside checking. It was a matter of seconds, maybe a minute at most.

​But we search and search. We find nothing out there either. We look at each other with confused glances and I say ""What the hell just happened? How can the door just open? We heard someone physically walk in?"" He answers ""I have no idea. There must be a logical explanation for this. This is insane."" My sister comes out too and asks what’s going on and if we found anyone.
​We try to come up with explanations for a long time. We bounce thoughts back and forth. But it ends with my sister's boyfriend being skeptical of my explanation about the supernatural, thinking there must be a logical explanation. But my sister and I were quite sure about what happened. Because this wasn't the first time this had happened. For us, yes, it was the first time. But my mom and dad have had several experiences with this phenomenon that they have told us about afterward.

​Sometimes when one of them comes home from work before the other, they might be in the kitchen fixing food. Then they hear someone come in through the front door. They call out ""Hello! Are you home so early today?"" only to get silence in return. Albin runs to the door, barking, as he always does when someone comes home. But the same thing happens again. He runs there and goes completely silent. They go to the hall to see who it was, only to find that no one has come home.

​So, I have no logical explanation for this. If this had been a one time thing, I might have accepted that someone tried to break in. But this has happened multiple times, either in the evening or when someone comes home from work. It feels like if it were a burglar, they’re doing a really bad job if they think it's a good idea to break in when people are finishing work or when most people are awake watching TV.

​The events have calmed down now that my parents finally replaced the old door with a modern one that has an automatic lock. I haven't heard anything from them regarding the ""hallway walker"" for a while at least. I’ll have to ask them next time I visit. They can be bad at sharing these things sometimes.

I work in a small department, it's just me and my manager. He's a wonderful person, we get along very well and we are friends.

We have a good work relationship and a good friendship. My only issue is his anxiety level.

I know it's not something which is easy to deal with, and when he as some strong personal issues, I'm always here fore him as a friend, but it gets sometimes too much.

I am not an anxious person, I am lucky enough to have a stable life, with a good support system, I grew up without any traumas (or at least not to the point where it had a strong negative impact on my current life and mental health).

However, I am still human and having to deal with my friend's stress at work is taxing. If he's in a good mood he's fine, but as soon as something bothered him or stressed him out, he has to talk abt it. He can bring a lot of negativity to my day: weather is not good, it's cold, it's not sunny, a train station employee was rude to him, he has a cold, etc. And so on. And he fixates on it. Sometimes his concerns are valid (his mom had a health scare for example), but it's the accumulation of everything almost every day that starts to annoy me.

I try to veer the conversation when it's abt mundane topics like the weather, but I don't want to be rude to him. I just want to have my peace and be there for him for important things.

How to deal with it? I don't want to risk hurting him, but at the same time, I don't think it's fair for him to vent all the time and bring this daily amount of negativity. Sometimes I just end up avoiding talking to him, using my headphones, and I skip taking coffee breaks together so we don't have to talk abt personal stuff.

I think he needs therapy, bc he has a lot of unresolved issues in my opinion, I also suspect he might have ADHD too, but I am not a professional and I feel it would be rude to tell someone to go to therapy. He's in his early 50s, and he is aware of his issues and stress (he has hypertension bc of it). He thinks he has found ways to handle them (lots of readings and introspection according to him), but I don't think he is really handling it well.",2,1769080647.0,Anxiety,2,1.0,False

**PROLOGUE — The Incident**

I remember the day Shizuru Aoi transferred into our class.

She stood at the front of the room, hands clasped in front of her, smiling nervously. The teacher asked her to introduce herself.

She opened her mouth.

""M-my name is... Shi... Shizu...""

The words stuck. Her face turned red. Some kids looked away. Others whispered.

The teacher said, ""Take your time.""

She tried again. ""Shizuru Aoi. N-nice to meet you.""

Polite applause. She sat down two rows ahead of me. I didn't think much of it. Just another transfer student.

For a few weeks, everything seemed fine. Classmates were nice. A girl named Hana lent her notes. She ate lunch with a group of girls by the window. She smiled more each day. Laughed at jokes. Participated in gym class.

I remember thinking: She's fitting in okay.

Then came the presentation.

Literature class. Book reports. She stood at the front, reading from carefully written notes. Her handwriting was neat. Precise.

Halfway through, she stuttered badly.

""The ch-ch-character...""

She couldn't get past it. Her face flushed. The classroom went silent.

Then someone giggled. I don't know who.

She tried again. ""The ch—""

More giggles. Scattered. Nervous.

Her hands shook. The papers rustled. She pushed through somehow, finished shakily, and sat down.

The whispers started immediately.

After that, things changed.

Hana, the girl who lent her notes, started sitting on the other side of the room. At lunch, the group by the window stopped saving her a seat.

Shizuru began eating alone. Sometimes in the classroom. Sometimes she disappeared entirely.

I still didn't do anything. I just watched.

I told myself it wasn't my business.

---

Then one day, she dropped her notebook in the hallway between classes.

I picked it up. Her name was written on the cover in that same precise handwriting.

Kaito, my friend since elementary school, grinned. ""Bet it takes her ten minutes to say 'thank you.'""

I looked at her. She was staring at the floor, cheeks red, waiting.

I don't know why I did it.

Maybe I wanted Kaito to laugh. Maybe I wanted to feel included. Maybe I just didn't think.

I mimicked her. Quietly. ""Th-th-thanks.""

Kaito burst out laughing. Others in the hallway joined in.

Shizuru's eyes widened. She took the notebook quickly, walked away fast, shoulders hunched.

I felt something twist in my chest. Guilt, maybe. Shame.

But Kaito slapped my back. ""Dude, that was perfect.""

I smiled. Pushed it down.

After that, it got worse.

Kids mimicked her stutter in the halls. ""S-s-see you later."" ""C-c-can I borrow a pen?""

Someone wrote ""S-s-s-stutterer"" on her desk in permanent marker. She scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito started calling her ""Broken Record."" Others picked it up.

I didn't lead any of it. But I laughed. I participated.

I was there.

Shizuru stopped speaking in class entirely. Started writing all her answers on paper. The teacher allowed it, looking uncomfortable.

She ate lunch in the bathroom. I know because I saw her go in one day, carrying her lunch bag.

I told myself it wasn't my fault. Everyone was doing it. I was just going along.

---

Then came the group project.

The teacher assigned groups randomly. Shizuru ended up with me, Kaito, and another guy named Jun.

Kaito groaned loudly. ""Great, we're gonna fail because she can't even talk.""

The class laughed.

Jun looked uncomfortable but said nothing.

I wanted to say something. Tell Kaito to shut up. Defend her.

But I didn't.

Instead, trying to get another laugh, I said, ""Maybe we should just let her write her part on a sign.""

More laughter. Louder.

Shizuru's eyes filled with tears.

She grabbed her bag and ran out of the classroom.

The teacher called after her. ""Shizuru! Shizuru, wait!""

She didn't stop.

The laughter died. The teacher glared at us. At me specifically.

""Hibiki. Kaito. Principal's office. Now.""

We got detention. A lecture about bullying. They called our parents.

But Shizuru didn't come back to class that week.

---

The following Monday, the announcement came during homeroom.

""Shizuru Aoi has transferred to another school for personal reasons. We wish her well.""

Her desk sat empty. Someone had already cleaned off the marker.

Kaito shrugged. ""Whatever. She was weird anyway.""

I stared at the empty desk. The precise handwriting. The careful organization.

All gone.

---

A few days later, the homeroom teacher pulled me aside after class.

""Hibiki. We need to talk.""

My stomach dropped.

""The principal spoke with Shizuru's parents. They mentioned bullying. Harassment.""

I couldn't breathe.

""Your name came up. Multiple times.""

I tried to speak. ""It wasn't just me—""

""That doesn't make it better.""

Word spread fast.

By the end of the week, I was the problem.

Someone wrote ""Bully"" on my desk. I scrubbed at it during lunch. It didn't come off.

Kaito and the others started sitting at a different table.

One day I approached them. Kaito looked up, loud enough for the cafeteria to hear: ""I always thought he was a jerk.""

Everyone at the table nodded.

I stood there, tray in hand, then walked away.

Found an empty table in the corner.

Someone whispered as I passed. ""He's the reason she left.""

I didn't argue. Didn't defend myself.

Because it was true.

---

For the next two years of middle school, I was invisible.

Ignored in group projects. Left out of conversations. Sometimes mocked.

""Hey, Hibiki, try not to make anyone else transfer, okay?""

I stopped trying to make friends. Stopped trying at all.

School. Home. Repeat.

Mom noticed. Of course she did.

""Hibiki, honey, is everything okay? You seem... distant.""

""I'm fine.""

""You can talk to me. About anything.""

""I know.""

But I didn't talk. I couldn't explain. Couldn't tell her what I'd done.

At night, I replayed it on loop.

Shizuru running out of the classroom. Her tears. Her shaking hands.

I thought: *I deserve this.*

---

Three years later, I still think that.

---

**ACT 1 — Present Day**

I wake up at 5 AM. Same nightmare. Same scene. Shizuru's face in the classroom.

I lie there, staring at the ceiling, waiting for my heart to slow.

Then I get up. Get ready quietly.

Mom's asleep on the couch, still in her scrubs from the night shift. Dark circles under her eyes. Empty coffee cup on the table. She works too hard. Double shifts to make ends meet.

I leave breakfast money on the table with a note: *For lunch. -H*

I want to wake her. Tell her to go to bed. Make her tea.

But I don't know how to talk to her anymore. Every conversation feels like lying.

I leave for school.

---

School is the same routine. I sit alone at lunch. Do my homework in the library. Keep my head down in class.

Kaito tries to talk to me sometimes in the hallway.

""Dude, you're being weird. It's been three years.""

Three years. Like time erases what you did.

""We were kids. Let it go.""

I don't answer. Walk past him.

He calls after me. ""Whatever, man. Your loss.""

---

One afternoon, walking home through the shopping district, I see a flyer on a lamppost.

**Community Radio Station — Volunteers Needed**
**All ages welcome. No experience required.**
**Contact Mikae at...**

I recognize the address. Near the old bridge over the river. The bridge I used to cross every day to get to middle school.

I've avoided that area for three years.

That night, alone in my room, I search the station online.

Their website is simple. A schedule. A mission statement about community voices.

And a photo.

A girl wearing oversized headphones, sitting in a booth, smiling slightly at something off-camera.

Shizuru.

My hands shake. I close the laptop. Open it again. Stare at her face.

She looks... okay. Not happy, exactly. But okay. Peaceful, maybe.

I wonder if she thinks about me. If she hates me. If she's forgotten.

I apply before I can change my mind. Fill out the form. Hit submit.

Then I sit there, staring at the confirmation screen, wondering what the hell I'm doing.

---

Three days later, I get an email.

Interview scheduled. Saturday afternoon.

I almost don't go.

But I do.

---

The station is smaller than it looked online. A converted storefront wedged between a laundromat and a used bookstore.

Inside, it's cluttered. Equipment everywhere. CDs stacked haphazardly. Posters on the walls.

Mikae, the manager, is in her forties. Short gray hair. Kind eyes. No-nonsense voice.

She sits across from me in a tiny booth. ""So. Hibiki Tanabe. Why do you want to work here?""

I rehearsed this. ""I like music. I want to learn about radio.""

She studies me for a long moment. Doesn't smile.

""You know Shizuru Aoi volunteers here?""

My throat closes.

""Thought so."" She leans back in her chair. ""I'm not stupid, kid. And I don't appreciate liars.""

""I'm not—""

""You applied two days after we posted her photo on the website.""

Silence.

""Look,"" she says. ""I don't know what happened between you two. She hasn't told me, and I haven't asked. But if you're here to cause trouble, to apologize, to unload your guilt—""

""I'm not. I just... want to help.""

""Help who? Her or yourself?""

I don't have an answer.

She sighs. Pulls out a schedule. ""Then help. Don't talk to her unless she talks to you first. Don't apologize unless she asks. Don't make this about your feelings. Just. Work.""

She hands me the schedule.

I take it. Nod.

""And Hibiki?""

""Yeah?""

""If she asks you to leave, you leave. Understood?""

""Understood.""

---

My first day, I arrive early. Nervous. Sweating despite the cool morning.

Shizuru is already there.

She's organizing CDs alphabetically. Her movements careful, precise. The same way she wrote.

She sees me.

Her hand freezes mid-air. The CD case trembles slightly.

We stare at each other.

I want to say something. Apologize. Explain.

My mouth opens. Nothing comes out.

Long silence.

Then Mikae enters, carrying coffee. ""Morning. Hibiki, you're on equipment cleaning today. Brushes and cloths in the closet. Shizuru, you're prepping the evening broadcast.""

Shizuru nods. Sets the CD down carefully. Leaves the room without looking at me.

The door closes.

I exhale. Realize I'd been holding my breath.

Mikae hands me a brush. ""Get to work.""

---

**ACT 2 — Attempts and Rejections**

Two weeks in. The routine is familiar now. I clean equipment. Organize files. Learn the soundboard.

Shizuru and I exist in the same space but don't speak. Sometimes we're in the booth together. She edits audio. I check cables.

Silence. Always.

One evening, I come home later than usual.

Mom's awake. Sitting at the kitchen table with a cup of tea. Still in her scrubs. Hair tied back, looking exhausted.

""Hibiki. You're working at a radio station?""

""Yeah.""

Her face lights up. ""That's wonderful! I didn't even know you were interested in that. Are you making friends?""

""It's just volunteer work.""

""Still. It's good to see you doing something. Getting out."" She smiles, hopeful. ""Maybe you'll make some friends there.""

I don't answer. Set my bag down.

Her smile fades slightly. ""Hibiki...""

""I'm tired, Mom.""

""I know. I just—"" She stops. Looks down at her tea. ""I worry about you.""

""I'm okay.""

""Are you?""

I don't know how to answer that. So I don't.

""Goodnight, Mom.""

""Goodnight.""

I go to my room. Lie in bed. Hate myself for shutting her out.

She deserves better. She works so hard. For me.

And I can't even talk to her.

---

Late at night, I write letters I'll never send.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm sorry for what I did. I know I hurt you. I think about it every day.*

Too simple. I cross it out.

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I was a coward. I let them bully you. I participated. I don't expect forgiveness. I just want you to know I regret it.*

I crumple it. Regret. What does that even mean? What does it fix?

*Dear Shizuru,*

*I'm trying to be better. I don't know if it matters.*

I stare at it for a long time. Then fold it carefully and put it in the drawer with the others.

Seventeen letters now.

All unsent.

---

Across town, Shizuru sits at her desk, finishing homework.

Her father, Daichi, knocks softly on her door. ""Dinner's ready.""

She holds up one finger. *One minute.*

He lingers at the doorway. ""How was the station today?""

She nods. *Good.*

""That boy... Hibiki. He's there, right?""

Her pen stops moving.

""Has he bothered you? Talked to you?""

She shakes her head. Writes on her notepad: *He doesn't talk to me.*

""Good."" But he doesn't look relieved. His jaw tightens. ""If he does, if he says anything—""

She writes: *I'm okay, Dad.*

He wants to say more. She can see it. The fear in his eyes. The helplessness.

He blames himself. She knows. For not noticing sooner. For not protecting her.

""I just..."" He trails off. ""I don't want you to get hurt again.""

She writes: *I won't.*

He nods. Doesn't believe her. ""Dinner in five minutes.""

After he leaves, she stares at her reflection in the dark window.

Wonders if she'll ever stop seeing herself as broken.

Wonders if her father will ever stop seeing her that way too.

---

One afternoon, Kaito shows up at the station. Unannounced. Loud.

""Yo, Hibiki! Dude, this is where you've been hiding?""

He barges in, looking around. Sees the equipment. The posters.

Then he sees Shizuru through the glass booth. She's on air, reading the weather report. Her voice is quiet but steady.

""Oh shit. Is that—""

Mikae cuts in, sharp. ""Keep your voice down. We're live.""

Kaito lowers his voice, grinning at me. ""Wait. You're working with *her*? Dude, that's awkward as hell.""

My fists clench.

""Leave.""

""What? Come on, man. We were just kids. She's fine now, right? I mean, she's talking on the radio.""

""Get out.""

His grin fades. ""Seriously?""

""Yeah. Seriously.""

He stares at me. ""You've changed.""

""Yeah. I have.""

He shakes his head, muttering. ""Whatever, man. This is weird.""

He leaves.

The door slams.

Mikae watches me. Says nothing. Goes back to her work.

In the booth, Shizuru finishes the weather report. Her eyes flick to me for a second. Then away.

---

One evening, Shizuru and I are alone in the station. Mikae left early for a dentist appointment.

A pre-recorded segment is playing. Classical music. Quiet.

Then the equipment glitches. Static bursts through the speakers, harsh and sudden.

Shizuru flinches.

I move quickly. ""I can fix it.""

She hesitates. Steps back from the console.

I work in silence. Checking cables. Restarting the system.

She watches from the corner of the booth. I can feel her eyes on me. Cautious. Wary.

The static


clears. The music returns, smooth and uninterrupted.

I turn to face her. ""Shizuru, I—""

She walks out before I can finish.

The door closes softly behind her.

I stand there, screwdriver in hand, alone in the booth.

The pre-recorded segment plays on. A piano piece. Satie. *Gymnopédie No. 1*.

Slow. Melancholic. Beautiful.

I almost laugh. Almost cry.

Instead, I just stand there, listening.

---

A few days later, a call comes through on the request line. I'm filling in for Mikae during the late shift.

""Hello, you've reached Community Radio. Any requests?""

""Hey."" The voice is male, young, tired but friendly. ""Can you play something quiet? It's been a long day.""

""Sure. Any preference?""

""Dealer's choice. You sound like you'd pick something good.""

I flip through the CD collection. Pull out Coltrane. *Naima*.

""How's this?""

""Perfect. Thanks, man.""

I play it. The saxophone fills the small station. Gentle. Searching.

The caller stays on the line, silent, just listening.

After the song ends, he speaks again. ""That was exactly what I needed. You've got good taste.""

""Thanks.""

""I'm Toma, by the way.""

""Hibiki.""

""Cool. I'll call again sometime.""

He hangs up.

For a moment, I just sit there.

A stranger called. We talked about music. Nothing else.

For those few minutes, I wasn't the guy who ruined someone's life.

I was just a guy who played Coltrane.

It feels strange. Foreign. Like wearing someone else's clothes.

But I don't hate it.

---

The next week, Toma calls again. Asks for something upbeat this time. We talk for fifteen minutes about jazz, about Miles Davis versus Coltrane, about whether vinyl sounds better than digital.

Normal conversation. Easy.

I realize I haven't had a conversation like this in years.

---

One afternoon, Aya Fujimoto shows up at the station.

I'm outside, taking out the trash, when she appears. Arms crossed. Expression hard.

""You're Hibiki Tanabe.""

It's not a question.

""Yeah.""

""I'm Aya. Shizuru's friend.""

I nod. Wait.

""Stay away from her.""

""I work here.""

""Then quit.""

""I'm not trying to hurt her.""

Her eyes flash. ""You already did. Or did you forget?""

""I didn't forget.""

""Then why are you here?""

I don't have a good answer. Not one that doesn't sound selfish.

She steps closer. ""She doesn't owe you forgiveness. She doesn't owe you closure. She doesn't owe you anything.""

""I know.""

""Do you?"" She searches my face, looking for a lie. ""Because if you're here to make yourself feel better, to ease your guilt, you're using her all over again.""

That lands. Hard.

I look down. ""That's not—""

""Isn't it?"" She doesn't let me finish. ""You hurt her. She left. Now she's finally doing okay, and you show up. What do you think that does to her?""

""She was already here when I—""

""I don't care. She was fine before you came. Now she's tense all the time. Looking over her shoulder.""

Guilt twists in my stomach.

""I didn't mean—""

""You never mean to, do you?"" Her voice is cold. ""But you still do damage.""

She turns to leave, then stops.

""If you actually care about her, you'll leave. That's the only way to help.""

She walks away.

I stand there in the alley behind the station, trash bag in hand, her words echoing.

*You're using her all over again.*

Am I?

I don't know anymore.

---

That night, I lie in bed, staring at the ceiling.

Aya's right.

I came here because Shizuru was here. I told myself it was to help. To atone.

But really, I just wanted to be near her. To see that she was okay. To ease my own guilt.

Selfish.

Always selfish.

I should quit.

But I don't.

---

**ACT 2.5 — The Forced Collaboration**

Two months into volunteering, it happens.

It's a Tuesday evening. Live broadcast. Shizuru's reading a poem on air. Her segment: ""Words Worth Hearing.""

She's halfway through when the microphone cuts out.

Dead silence on the broadcast.

Panic flashes across her face. She taps the mic. Nothing.

In the control room, Mikae swears. Checks the board. ""It's the cable. Hibiki, get in there. Now.""

I grab a replacement cable and rush into the booth.

Shizuru steps back, still holding the poem, hands trembling slightly.

I work fast. Unplug the dead cable. Swap it. Test the connection.

The mic crackles back to life.

""You're good,"" I whisper.

She takes a breath. Steps back to the mic.

Continues reading where she left off. Her voice doesn't shake.

*""And in the silence between words,*
*we find the space to breathe,*
*to heal,*
*to begin again.""*

She finishes the poem. Signs off gracefully.

The broadcast ends.

I'm still kneeling by the cable, unsure if I should leave.

She turns to me.

For a long moment, we just look at each other.

Then she nods. Once. Small.

I nod back.

She leaves the booth.

I stay there, cable in hand, heart pounding.

It's not forgiveness. Not even close.

But it's acknowledgment.

And for now, it's enough.

---

**ACT 3 — The Broadcast**

A month later, Mikae announces a special broadcast.

""Shizuru's doing a solo show. 'Voices That Matter.' She'll be reading listener stories about finding their voice.""

My stomach twists.

""When?""

""Friday. 8 PM.""

I nod.

---

Friday arrives.

The station is busier than usual. A few listeners show up in person to watch through the booth window.

Shizuru prepares quietly. Organizing her notes. Testing the mic.

Mikae pulls her aside. ""You sure you're ready?""

Shizuru writes on her notepad: *Yes.*

Mikae squeezes her shoulder. ""You've got this.""

---

8 PM.

Shizuru goes live.

""Good evening. This is Shizuru Aoi. Thank you for joining me tonight.""

Her voice is hesitant at first. Careful.

""Tonight, I want to share stories. From people like me. People who lost their voice. And found it again.""

She reads the first letter. From a woman who developed a stutter after a car accident. Who went years without speaking. Who found healing through poetry.

Then another. A man who went silent after losing his daughter. Who found his voice again through music.

Another. A teenager with social anxiety. Who started a podcast from their bedroom.

Story after story.

I listen from the control room, adjusting levels, making sure everything runs smoothly.

But mostly, I just listen.

Shizuru's voice grows steadier with each story. More confident.

She's not reading about herself. But in a way, she is.

Each story is a piece of her own.

Halfway through, I feel it. The urge.

To interrupt. To apologize. To tell her I'm sorry, that I see her now, that I understand.

I start to stand.

Mikae's hand lands on my shoulder. Firm.

""Don't.""

""I just—""

""You don't get to control her healing, Hibiki.""

I freeze.

""This isn't about you,"" she says quietly. ""It never was.""

I sit back down.

Listen.

Shizuru finishes the broadcast. Reads one final letter. From a middle school student who was bullied for stuttering. Who transferred schools. Who found a radio station that gave them a place to speak.

My breath catches.

""They wrote: 'I don't know if I'll ever forgive the people who hurt me. But I know I'm more than what they said I was. And that's enough.'""

Silence.

Then Shizuru speaks, her own words now.

""If you're listening tonight, and you've lost your voice—literally or otherwise—I want you to know: You don't have to be loud to matter. You don't have to be fearless. You just have to be willing. To try. Even when it's hard. Especially when it's hard.""

She pauses.

""Thank you for listening. Goodnight.""

The broadcast ends.

Through the booth window, I see her. She's smiling. Small. Real.

People clap.

I realize: She doesn't need me to fix this.

She's already fixing herself.

---

**ACT 4 — The Bridge**

Three months pass.

I keep working at the station. Shizuru and I still don't talk much. But the tension eases. Slightly.

We exist in the same space without it feeling like a wound.

Progress, maybe.

One Saturday afternoon, I decide to walk home the long way.

Past the old bridge.

I haven't crossed it since middle school. Three years of avoidance.

But today, I do.

The river is loud. Rain from last night. The water rushes beneath, brown and turbulent.

Halfway across, I see her.

Shizuru.

Sitting on the railing, legs dangling, phone in hand. Recording the river.

My first instinct is to turn back.

But I don't.

I approach slowly. Stop a few steps away.

""I won't stay long.""

She looks at me. Nods.

Permission, maybe. Or just acknowledgment.

""I'm trying to be better,"" I say. ""You don't have to care.""

The river fills the silence.

She lowers her phone. Speaks. Slowly. Carefully.

""I know.""

Two words. But they land heavy.

""I'm sorry,"" I say. ""I know that's not enough.""

""It's not.""

I nod. Swallow hard.

Pause.

""But you're here.""

I look at her.

""You didn't run,"" she continues. ""You didn't make excuses. You just... stayed.""

My throat tightens.

""I don't forgive you.""

""I don't expect you to.""

""But I see you. Trying.""

The words hit me harder than any anger could.

""That's all I can give.""

""It's more than I deserve.""

She looks at the river. ""Maybe.""

I turn to leave.

""Hibiki.""

I stop.

""Don't come back here. To this bridge.""

I nod. Understand.

This place is hers. Her healing space.

I don't belong here.

""Okay.""

She lifts her phone again. Resumes recording.

The sound of water fills the space between us.

I walk away.

Don't look back.

---

**ACT 5 — Six Months Later**

Shizuru leads a workshop now. Every Thursday evening.

""Audio Storytelling for Beginners.""

She teaches others how to use recording equipment. How to edit. How to find their voice.

Literally and metaphorically.

I watch sometimes from the control room. She's confident now. Patient. Kind.

Explains things clearly. Encourages mistakes. Celebrates small victories.

One week, her father attends.

Daichi sits in the back, arms crossed at first. Skeptical. Protective.

But as the session continues, his posture softens.

He listens.

Really listens.

Shizuru talks about sound. About how recording gives you control. How you can replay your voice until it sounds right.

How sometimes, hearing yourself is the first step to believing in yourself.

After the session, Daichi approaches her.

He doesn't say anything.

Just hugs her.

Long. Tight.

She hugs him back.

When they pull apart, his eyes are wet.

""I'm proud of you,"" he whispers.

She nods. Smiles.

---

Toma visits the station in person for the first time.

He's younger than I expected. Early twenties. Messy hair. Bookstore employee lanyard around his neck.

""You're the guy with the good taste. Nice to finally meet you.""

We shake hands.

""Toma. Good to meet you too.""

We talk for an hour. About music. Books. He recommends a novel. I recommend an album.

Normal. Easy.

At one point, he says, ""You seem different than you sound on the phone.""

""Different how?""

""Lighter. On the phone, you always sound... I don't know. Weighted down. But in person, you smile more.""

I think about that.

""Maybe I am lighter,"" I say.

He grins. ""Good. Keep it up.""

---

One morning, Mom catches me before I leave for school.

""Hibiki. Wait.""

I stop.

She's still in her pajamas. Morning off, finally.

""You're smiling more,"" she says.

""Am I?""

""Yeah."" She looks hopeful. Careful. Like she's afraid to jinx it. ""The radio station... it's good for you.""

""Yeah. It is.""

She steps closer. Hugs me.

Quick. Tight.

""I'm proud of you. I don't know what changed, but... I'm proud.""

I hug her back.

""Thanks, Mom.""

She pulls away, wiping her eyes.

""Go. You'll be late.""

I leave, but I'm smiling.

---

One afternoon, outside the station, I see a kid struggling with broken headphones.

Maybe ten years old. Frustrated. Hitting them against his hand.

""Hey. Those broken?""

He looks up. ""Yeah. Only one side works.""

I pull out my own headphones. Hand them over.

""Here. Take these.""

He looks suspicious. ""These don't work right either.""

""One side's broken. But you only need one side to start listening.""

He takes them. Skeptical but grateful.

""Thanks, mister.""

He runs off.

I watch him go.

Think about broken things.

How sometimes they still work.

Just differently.

---

That evening, Shizuru is on air. Closing her weekly show.

I'm in the control room, adjusting levels, monitoring the feed.

Through the glass, we make eye contact.

No smile. No wave.

Just a small nod.

I nod back.

She returns to her broadcast.

I return to my work.

---

Later, walking home, I cross the bridge.

Not the one where I saw Shizuru. A different one.

The river is calm tonight. Reflecting streetlights.

I stop in the middle.

Think about distance.

How some distances never close.

How some damage never fully heals.

But how you can still move forward.

Still try.

Still listen.

---

The bridge didn't erase the distance between us.

It just made it safe to cross.

1qjrps4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CafelatRobot/comments/1qjrps4/raw_taste_how_to_improve_for_sweeteness/,Raw taste! How to improve for sweeteness?,"Hi. Been almost two months that i got my robot which i have paired it with j ultra grinder.

I'm suffering with the j ultra tbh. Cannot set the zero point correctly but i have managed to find the grind setting by grinding right before the robot is unable to easily drip the coffee.

Ps. Pardon my english as its not my native language.

The issue is that i get sort of very raw taste which tends to be on the bitter side (not so bitter tbh). 

My usual workflow is double the grams. Eg 18 in, 36 out. I usually do 14 in and 28 out with a few sec 2 bar preinfusion followed by either 6 or 8 bar extraction. I either let it finish at 6 or 8 or after it reaches 20 grams i do 4 bar till 28 grams. I heat the water to boiling temp

I also tried 1:3 ratio and did not notice any difference. I actually try to avoid this one as it produces more coffee than i usually drink with my espresso.

One thing is that it has been pretty tough to get fresh roasted beans here. Im in albania(balkans) and only 1 shop had fresh ones and the beans tasted bad tbh, heck even their espressos on the shop are very bad. The rest have been sealed medium or dark roasts but not fresh.

The fresh beans part has turned into a big issue as it seems european shops mostly dont ship here and of those who do they have high shipping.

Im trying to improve with what i have for now but km unsure what else i can improve with my workflow. I spray the beans, use a dedicated distributor and tamper accordingly.

Maybe all the issue is becuase i dont have good fresh beans :/ but i have yet to get one and compare to it hehe

Appressiate any input

Edit: i also tried espresso sourced from local bars. Only one seemed kinda ok but produced more foam than usual, i suppose they are way too fresh?

Also, since i did not add photos, heres some i have taken previously https://imgur.com/a/V0DwS7c

Of course, everyone likes a good deal, but it seems like every time I contact my customers, it’s just to share another discount. I’m concerned they’ll start expecting a sale every time and overlook what else makes our shop unique.

I’ve been thinking about how to keep customers interested without always talking about sales. I might start sharing more behind-the-scenes content, like how we brew our coffee, where we get our beans, or fun facts about our staff. I could also offer tips for making better coffee at home or talk about new coffee trends. I want to stay connected with customers without always offering discounts.

I also found this platform [https://bonusqr.com](https://bonusqr.com), which has a loyalty program that isn’t just about discounts. It rewards customers for visiting or being part of the community. This seems like a more sustainable way to keep people interested without always having to run sales. I think it could be worth trying.

1qjrnv9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Soda/comments/1qjrnv9/coke_zero_vanilla_discontinuation_uk_ive_finally/,Coke Zero Vanilla discontinuation (UK) - I’ve finally found my diy replacement,"**The TL;DR:**

It won't be exact Coke Zero Vanilla, but after a few cans, it felt pretty close to the feeling for me. **Keep it simple.** Use **regular Coke Zero (or Caffeine-free Coke Zero**, a win for me because I'm being careful with caffeine) and **add 4mL to 4.5mL of Preema Vanilla Essence** ([https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00GAGLU6G](https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B00GAGLU6G)) per can. **Added cost per can = £0.05**

Is anyone else diy-ing their own ""recipe""? And has anyone gotten super close to the original taste? Keen to hear people's thoughts.

**Full Post:**

As for many Coke Zero Vanilla fans, the discontinuation in the UK (a few months ago) genuinely annoyed me more than it should have. It's not the first time that corporate fuckery and discontinuations generated frustration for me, but it might have been the most impactful. I remember thinking (even before they cut us off), ""What am I going to do if they ever stop making it?"". At that time I already wondered whether I could diy an alternative with Vanilla extract but I wasn;t overly concerned as long as I was getting ""my fix"" from the shop \^\^.

Anyways, jump back to this summer when it became difficult to buy the real thing in the UK, I was doing the rounds of the corner shops around my area checking if they had any left, and defaulting to drinking regular vanilla coke (still available here and there)... But it wasn't working for me. I drink quite a bit of the stuff, so I started to put on a little weight and I had to restrain myself. I just missed the zero option. And regardless of all this, even regular coke vanilla wasn't necessarily easy to find.

I scoured reddit to check if someone had posted about ""a source"" / a shop that would still carry some stocks... In vain. So I thought back to my idea of diy-ing it.

I looked for suggestion online, but didn't find anything meaningfully comprehensive and decided to start experimenting myself.

I started looking for vanilla syrups from my local supermarket or off of Amazon...

Of course, this was a mistake... I feel pretty dumb about it in hindsight. I tried barista vanilla syrups (used to make flavoured coffees). Like I said, most of you wouldn't have been as stupid, but as soon as I tried it, I realized that the syrup was adding a lot of sweetness... Duh! So it wasn't it. I lost £10 on that (£20 even because I bought the wrong flavour the first time around... Anyways!)

I ended up looking for vanilla extracts, but I was slightly dubious because I was never really impressed by the taste / ""intensity"" vs price ratio of the products available in my local supermarkets. Brands like Nielsen-Massey, or Dr. Oetker or even the standard Sainsbury's brand, always felt either too expensive or too ""diluted"" and disappoiting in the taste they actually add in cooking.

I realised that there's actually a difference between vanilla extract (made and processed from natural vanilla which is prohibitively expensive) and vanilla essence (which is synthetically made and is basically artificial ""vanillin"" from what I understand -I'll have to caveat that I am no food engineer / chemist so don't rely too much on that explanation).

Anyways, I forgot about the supermarket stuff and looked on Amazon. I tried two brands: Foodie Flavours and Preema:  
The Foodie Flavours is much more expensive but looked to be quite concentrated (just a few drops would suffice). It came in Vanilla flavour but also Custard flavour (which I had read might be worth layering to the vanilla flavour -maybe just 1 tiny drop- to get close to the original taste of the Coke)...  
The Preema, on the other end came in a massive 1/2L bottle for like £6.00. It looked quite cheap, I wasn't as sure about it.

Originally, I thought that the Foodie Flavours brand looked more promising, I tried both over the course of a few days... In different dosages, adding the custard flavour or not... And I'll be honnest and say that the Preema essence took it for me.

I don't think I have gotten ""deceptively close"" to the original Coke Zero flavour, but it's gotten close enough for my own taste. I've basically settled on 4 to 4.5mL of the Preema essence for a 330mL can.

I got a long pipette that I keep in the fridge close to the vanilla essence and I just have to crack a can open and add the 4mL.

Again, I think for someone that is looking for the exact taste of Coke Zero Vanilla it's probably not ""just right"" but I found that it still really scratch that hitch for me and adds that vanilla sweetness that I crave with the Coke. I've found that some added benefit are that my wife likes hers with just a tad less (more like 3 /3.5mL) so the solution works for us. And I have also been able to move to Coke Zero Caffeine-free as a way for me to keep my caffeine-levels low.

And with the Preema essence (quite a big bottle) and still relatively cheap, the added cost is only like £0.05 per can, which I'm more than happy with!

It's been a fun few weeks/months of experimenting and I'm quite chuffed with the place I ended with all this. It feels like I have future-proofed my Coke Zero Vanilla addiction (unless the decide to kill Coke Zero which I don;t anticipate).

I much more of a lurker on Reddit, but for the past few weeks, everytime that I crack open a can of Coke and pour the vanilla essence in, I've been thinking of all the other people I have seen posting about the great tragedy of the Coke Zero Vanilla disappearance. So today I decided I'd share all this with you.

I'm curious if anybody else has come up with their own little diy hack / replacement (I'm sure loads of you have as well). I'd be keen to hear about how other people are ""making"" their very own Coke Zero Vanilla. What products are you using / what dosage? Has someone gotten really close to the original taste?...

I'd love to hear from y'all!

It usually ends in us wishing the best for eachother, but for some reason this one really got under my skin and made me question my self worth.

This girl gave me a rose on hinge (which is basically a super like) and started talking to me about my dream journal and we got to texting. I unfortunately had to fly out of town but we must have texted for 2 or 3 weeks total the whole time, she was very present and had a lot to talk about with me. So I got home and we met for coffee, that went pretty good as well. She was super talkative and we had some deeper than expected conversations about how ignoring a problem is a form of confrontation and how other cultures interact and socialize with eachother. Nothing really screamed ""hey, I'm bored"" and she gave me her number and said she'd love to meet again.

Pretty much every text after that was just extremely dry from her. Really uninterested generally and taking really long times to respond. i asked if she wanted to video chat since I felt like maybe I was overthinking things and she responded ""I'd love to, and dont overthink things! I'm just busy planning my birthday party"". We video chatted and again, had a decent conversation but I could tell she was just not as in to it this time. Then she texted me a day later saying ""Hey, I've lost interest. I have not found any of our conversations interesting""

I'm very confused because I wasn't the one being extremely dry for the last week, and I really was just trying to get her to talk about things she was excited for or enjoyed. Was there maybe another underlying reason? I feel so hurt by this to be honest.",3,1769079711.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

I looked back.,"The lodge was quiet, the road outside stretching black and empty under the moonlight. I leaned against my desk scanning the roster. Jerry came in from the break room, coffee in hand, but he didn’t set it down. He just stood there holding it like an anchor.

“Quiet night,” he said. His voice was lower than usual, almost swallowed.

“As always.”

I turned toward him, elbows on my knees. “I was thinking a lot about it… I know we’re not supposed to talk about what happened. I just need to know, ”

Jerry’s eyes flicked to the rear window behind me, then away so fast I almost missed it. “What are you on about?”

“Dan. What really happened to him? Why is he suddenly off the roster? Why didn’t he tell us why he left?”

He rubbed the inside of his left wrist with his thumb, hard, like he was trying to erase something under the skin. “You shouldn’t ask questions that have nothing to do with you.”

“I deserve to know, Jerry. We all do. How can I be sure I’ll still have a job tomorrow if people just… vanish? Why is everyone so goddamn quiet about it?”

He stared at the floor for a long beat. Then, quieter: “Dan didn’t follow the rules.” “What rules?” Jerry’s jaw worked. “You know the one.” “I don’t.” He swallowed. “Good.” A pause. His thumb kept circling that same spot on his wrist. “He looked back.” I waited. He didn’t elaborate. “So they fired him for breaking some bullshit rule?” Jerry finally met my eyes, only for a second, then looked past me again, toward the dark behind the booth. “You can make your own conclusions.” He set the untouched coffee on the desk like he was afraid to keep holding it. “Your job is to deny or give access. That’s it.”

I nodded, though the knot in my stomach said otherwise.

He grabbed his jacket. At the door he stopped, back to me. “I know you have questions, Drew. I get it.” His voice cracked on my name. “But if you ever feel it, that little tug, like someone just brushed the hair at the nape of your neck, don’t… don’t turn. Just radio in. Pretend you dropped your pen. That’s what I do now.”

The door clicked shut softer than it should have.

The abyss of the night settled in. Five executives expected. Verify plate, let them through. For rando’s, match the ID. Simple.

At 12:30 a.m. the first car rolled up. Executive clearance. Fancy black sedan, tinted windows. Gate open. Tires crunched over gravel like dry bones.

I stared straight ahead. My heart ticked too fast. The urge to glance in the side mirror was almost physical, but I forced myself not to.

Gate closed. Hydraulic hiss too loud.

There isn’t much to do in the gatehouse. No signal. No Wi-Fi. Radio checks in once an hour between midnight and 3:00, then every thirty minutes after. Most nights I write. Sketch. Read manga. Anything to stay awake.

Anything to pretend I don’t notice that every sound comes from behind me.

Not the front. Not the sides. Always behind.

A twig doesn’t snap, it shifts its weight, deliberate, directly behind my left ear. Leaves don’t drag across dirt, they scrape slowly across scalp. Wind doesn’t huff. It exhales against the short hairs below my collar, held too long.

A few hours crawled by. Another set of headlights. Executive again. As the car eased past, something flickered in the rear glass, a pale shape stretching longer than a hand should. I jerked my eyes forward. “Focus, Drew. Forward.”

2:15 a.m. No cars. Just the fluorescents humming and the clock ticking like someone counting down.

3:00 a.m. Headlights, slower, dimmer. Executive plate. Gate open. The car crept past. In the rear window: a palm flat against the tint. Then the fingers lengthened, stretching downward, tips thinning into threads that kept going after the glass ended.

I snapped my head forward. Hair on my arms stood up. The gate clanged shut.

“What the fuck was that?” I muttered.

The temptation to look back was a living thing in my chest. I picked up my pencil instead. Started sketching what I’d seen. Tendril fingers pressed against the window. Silhouette faint enough to doubt. Clear enough to understand.

I dropped the pencil. It clattered.

That’s when I noticed the paper.

Folded, tucked beneath the table, held by a wad of gum that was still warm. Damp. I crouched, peeled it free. The gum clung to my fingers longer than it should have.

Unfolded.

Handwriting barely legible, frantic, carved deep. Left edge torn ragged. Timestamps at the top of each paragraph.

**03:42** I hear it. It watches. I feel its fingers reaching… always behind me. I shouldn’t look. I don’t want to. But I have to. Every time it passes I feel it press against me. It moves slow. Deliberate. The gate hisses shut, trapping me in the cage with it. Metal on metal. I cannot turn my head yet I sense it closer each time. It wants me to see. It wants me to follow. Don’t turn. Don’t follow. But we will. We always do.

The radio crackled. “November Delta, please respond. Come in, November Delta. Do you copy?”

I’d missed the check-in. How? “This is November Delta… sorry… I didn’t hear the radio,” I stammered.

Clock read 03:42.

I kept reading. The second entry was worse. Letters overlapping, ink bleeding like something wet had touched the page after it was written.

**03:46** It called. No sight. I watched. I had to. It told me to. It would have taken me if I hadn’t run. I had to. It took them. Ate them. I could feel it crushing them, their screams trapped in the air I breathed. Even detached I could feel it. Hungry. Endless. All consuming. It let me run. Don’t turn. Don’t follow. But we will. We always do.

A scream tore through the forest behind the gatehouse. Not far. Not near. Present. Broken words stretched and moaned through the trees.

“Look. Look. Look.”

I clamped hands over my ears. Squeezed eyes shut. Light pulsed behind my lids.

Headlights cut the dark. Another executive car. I tore my hands away. The sound vanished. Silence rushed in, too complete.

I leaned forward to read the plate. My hand hovered over the controls. The button lit up on its own. The gate hissed open without me touching anything.

Tires didn’t crunch. They glided.

The rear window was empty this time. But the glass behind me, the booth’s rear window, fogged slowly. From the inside.

I didn’t turn.

The diary fluttered in my grip. I looked down.

A new line had appeared beneath the last entry. Handwriting shakier. Smaller. Still wet.

**03:51** It’s closer now. I can feel the heat from its mouth on the back of my skull. It doesn’t have lips. Just edges. It whispers my payroll number. The one I never told anyone. Don’t look, Drew. Please. I’m sorry I looked.

My name. In Dan’s handwriting.

The radio crackled again. “November Delta, status.”

I opened my mouth.

No sound came.

Because something was already in my throat, holding the words down. Not fingers. Not a hand. Just pressure. Steady. Patient. Like a palm the size of my skull cupping the back of my head from the inside.

Headlights appeared again. No plate light. Just two beams low to the ground, crawling.

The gate hissed open, again without me touching anything.

The car stopped. Passenger window down. Just an inch.

Enough to hear it breathing.

Not loud. Not quiet. Exactly the volume of my own lungs if I were sitting beside myself.

I feel the tug now. Not at my neck. Deeper. Behind my eyes.

I haven’t turned my head. I swear I haven’t.

But something behind me just said my name. Soft. Patient. Like it’s been waiting all night for me to notice it was already here.

The chair creaks. Just a fraction. Chairs aren’t supposed to turn on their own.

The radio crackles one last time.

“November Delta, copy that. All clear.”

I never answered.

But it logged me anyway.

1qjrkn6,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1qjrkn6/sp_untitled_story/,[SP] Untitled story,"Part One: The Rupture

Jack's alarm screamed at 5:47 AM, thirteen minutes before he needed to be awake. He'd set it wrong again. Or maybe right—he could never remember which way the numbers were supposed to go. The ceiling of his apartment bore the same water stain it had carried for eight months, shaped like a continent he couldn't name.

Walmart. Again. Third one in two years. He'd been fired from the others for reasons that made sense in the moment but evaporated when he tried to explain them later. Attendance issues. Attitude problems. The usual litany of someone who couldn't quite keep their grip on the world.

The fluorescent lights buzzed with their particular frequency of misery. Jack stocked shelves in the back, away from customers, which suited him fine. He'd learned to move through the world like a ghost, present but not *there*, and most days that was enough.
He didn't notice the tremor at first. The building shook occasionally—trucks in the loading bay, the compressor for the freezers. But this tremor didn't stop. It built a resonance that made his teeth ache and his vision blur at the edges.
Then the screaming started.
Jack dropped the box of cereal he'd been holding and moved toward the front of the store, not running but walking with the deliberate pace of someone who'd learned that panic accomplished nothing. Other employees rushed past him toward the exits, customers abandoning full carts in the aisles.
The thing that shouldn't exist stood in the produce section.
It was massive, ten feet tall at least, maybe more. Its geometry hurt to look at—angles that didn't resolve, surfaces that seemed to fold into themselves. Organic but wrong, too many joints in its limbs, movements that stuttered between frames like a film with missing footage. It made a sound, low and resonant, that Jack felt in his sternum more than heard.
Everyone else was screaming, running, clustering toward exits in mindless terror. Jack stood still.
The creature swung what might have been a head toward him. No eyes that Jack could identify, but he felt its attention like weight, like pressure. It was confused. Scared. The wrongness of it wasn't malice—it was *displacement*. A thing that didn't belong, that knew it didn't belong.

A memory surfaced, unbidden and complete: darkness, stone walls pressing close, the metallic taste of fear, small hands scrambling for purchase on wet rock. The cave. He'd been twelve, on a camping trip with his uncle's family. Separated from the group, fallen through a gap in the earth. Hours in the dark, maybe longer. Time had stopped meaning anything. Just the climb, the slow ascent, alone because no help was coming.

This isn't even that bad, his mind supplied calmly.

Jack's mouth opened and words came out that he didn't recognize, syllables that twisted in the air and tasted like copper and ozone. The language of elsewhere, of the spaces between. He was speaking to it.

The creature's attention sharpened. It responded, the same impossible language flowing back. Jack understood—fragments, impressions. Lost. Afraid. Hungry. Wrong place wrong place wrong place.

""I know,"" Jack said, still in that other tongue. ""I can help. Let me—""

The creature charged.

Jack's vision went black. He woke in a hospital bed, fluorescent lights burning overhead. A nurse checked his vitals, smiled professionally, told him he'd been unconscious for six hours. No injuries. No explanation. Lucky she said.

Later, after the nurse left, a man in a dark suit entered without knocking. He had the kind of face that was hard to remember, features that slipped away from memory even as you looked at them.

""Jack Riverside,"" the man said, consulting a tablet. ""You spoke to it.""


""I don't remember,"" Jack said, which was true. Everything after the creature's charge was just... gone. A gap where the most important moments should be.

The man studied him for a long moment. ""There's another one. Smaller. Less hostile. We need you to try again.""

""Why?""

""Because you can do something we can't."" The man's expression didn't change. ""And because you don't have a choice.""

Jack asked about Walmart. The man's composure cracked for just a second—a flinch, a step backward. Then he explained in careful, clinical terms: seventeen casualties. Creature neutralized. Investigation ongoing. All very contained, very managed.

""You're employed now,"" the man said. ""With us. We maintain the infrastructure that keeps reality functional. You'll be reading up on the details.""

""And if I say no?""

The man didn't answer, which was answer enough
The facility existed in the kind of building that people's eyes slid past—beige, bureaucratic, aggressively forgettable. Jack was given a room that was comfortable in the way hospital rooms are comfortable: clean, impersonal, designed for temporary occupation.

They transported him to a rural movie theater the next day. The team was professional, efficient, armed with equipment Jack didn't recognize. The theater showed signs of damage—walls cracked, ceiling partially collapsed, the marquee hanging at an angle.

Inside, among scattered popcorn and overturned seats, something small moved.
About the size of a bobcat, covered in what might have been fur or might have been something that only resembled fur. It was eating popcorn kernels, delicate and focused.

Jack approached slowly. The team hung back, watching.

This time there was no calm. Jack's heart hammered, his palms went slick with sweat. The creature was small but something about it—the way it moved, the quality of its attention—felt predatory. Aware. It looked up as he got closer and Jack could see more than the team could, more than normal eyes should perceive.

The creature wasn't just hungry. It was ravenous, an emptiness that went beyond physical appetite. Dark stains marked the carpet near the concession stand, and the scattered employee uniforms told a story Jack didn't want to complete. The theater hadn't been evacuated in time.
The creature attacked before Jack could speak.

A screaming headache split his skull, white-hot and absolute. Jack froze as something *moved* inside him, beneath his skin, impossible and vast. A serpent's head emerged from his jacket sleeve—green scales, slitted eyes, far too large to fit in any physical space—and struck the creature with surgical precision.

The team stood paralyzed as the serpent devoured the bobcat-thing in three efficient movements, then retracted back under Jack's shirt, sliding beneath fabric and flesh like water.

“Of course it’s a fucking snake!” Jack fell backward, gasping. His oldest fear, his deepest revulsion, now *living inside him*.

The panic attack hit hard and completely.

The team drove him back in silence. No one had explanations. Or if they did, they weren't sharing.

They left him in the comfortable room and Jack spent hours examining himself in the mirror. His skin looked the same. Felt the same. But he knew, bone-deep and certain, that something massive coiled inside him.

Eventually exhaustion won. Jack lay down and sleep claimed him.

The dream began in a concrete box walls closed, ceiling low, no door he could see. Then the eyes appeared. Green, slitted, vast. The headache started again, that screaming pressure, but this time it shifted, distorted, became sound, became static, became words.

""I'm not a monster like the others.""

The serpent emerged into the light, scales gleaming, head the size of Jack's torso. When it locked eyes with him, Jack felt the connection solidify—invasive, intimate, undeniable.

""What are you?"" Jack managed.

""Explaining what I am would take time we don't have. The veil exists to keep realities separate. The creatures you've seen are breaches, accidents. They don't belong in your world.""

""Why are you inside me?""

The serpent moved closer. ""You were a victim of cosmic circumstances. Your near-death experience when you were twelve—you remember it?""

The cave. The darkness. The slow climb. The moment his hands lost their grip and he fell, the impact, the Nothing that followed before someone found him.

""At the exact moment you died and came back,"" the serpent continued, ""on the inverted coordinates of Earth, a cult attempted a ritual. Their research was poor, their execution worse. They tore a hole between worlds. I was... fleeing. I needed somewhere to hide. You were a crack in reality, and I slipped through.""

""You've been inside me for—""

""Since then. Yes.""

Jack processed this. Years. He'd been carrying this thing for *years*, never knowing, never understanding why he felt caught between worlds.

""The organization,"" Jack said. ""Are they—""

""Do not trust the humans either,"" the serpent said, retreating back into shadow. ""They have their own purposes. You're useful now. Be careful what that means.""

The dream ended.

Jack woke in his own bed two days later. The organization had returned him to his apartment after extensive debriefing—hours of questions, medical tests, psychological evaluations. They'd given him painkillers for the headaches and a phone number to call when the next breach occurred. Because there would be a next breach. There was always a next breach.

His alarm blared the same as always. For a moment, his mind tried to rationalize everything as nightmare, stress dream, psychotic break. He went through the motions of getting ready for work because what else was there to do?

The Walmart was the same Walmart. Same fluorescent buzz, same minimum wage tedium. Jack stocked shelves and tried not to think about impossible serpents or concrete dreams.
Then the headache returned, sharp and urgent. With it came overwhelming pressure: *run, leave, get out NOW.*
Jack breathed through it, practiced the coping mechanisms he'd developed over years of trauma. The panic was familiar, manageable. Just another day of—
The building shook. Not an earthquake, something else. The sound of falling rocks echoed through the store, and Jack's mind supplied the memory again: the cave, darkness, the terror of being buried alive.
Customers and employees fled toward the exits. Standard protocol. Get out, get to safety, don't stay in a collapsing building.
*Don't leave*, a voice said in Jack's head.

He didn't question it. Jack walked toward the back of the store, against the flow of evacuation, deeper into the building.

*Hide.*

He ducked behind a display, crouching low. In his mind's eye, the serpent appeared—coiled, watching, ready.

Then: a gunshot.

Jack peered around the display. A man stood in the center aisle, maybe fifty, gripping a pistol with the confidence of someone who'd never faced anything a gun wouldnt solve. He was shouting something about God and protection and standing his ground.

Another shot. The bullet hit nothing visible, sparked against concrete.

Then the man lifted off the ground, grabbed by something unseen, and was thrown twenty feet into a shelf. He didn't get up.

*This one requires cooperation*, the serpent's voice said. *We need to trap it in the freezer.*

""Cooperation?"" Jack whispered.

*Trust me. I'll help you see it.*
Jack blinked.

When his eyes opened, they were different. Green. Slitted. The world resolved into heat signatures and movement, and suddenly the invisible thing had *form*—a massive shape, humanoid but wrong, radiating heat like a furnace.

*Enrage it. Lead it to the freezer. I'll guide your movements.*

Jack stood and ran, shouting. The thing's attention snapped to him. He moved, and his body responded in ways that shouldn't be possible—chaotic, tangled, like he was fighting his own skeleton. Serpent instincts in a human frame, deadly and graceful and completely wrong.

The creature pursued, Jack led, and for a moment it almost worked.

Then it caught him. A massive invisible limb smacked Jack across the chest and sent him flying backward. He hit the ground hard, breath gone, vision blurring.

The serpent appeared in his mind, mouth open, fangs exposed.

Jack extended his bleeding hand.

The serpent bit down.

Pain jolted him alert and clear. Without thinking, operating on instinct he shouldn't have, Jack raised his hand and spoke: ""Shadowscale.""

His skin *lifted* from his arm—not tearing, but transforming. Flesh became scales became smoking projectiles that launched toward the creature like rockets. They struck home, each one detonating with force that made the air crack.

The invisible thing collapsed, heat signature fading.

Jack's arm fell to his side, blood dripping. ""How the hell do you call that cooperation?""

He passed out.

He woke in his bed again. A crude bandage wrapped his arm, already soaked through. The pain was real and present, sharp enough that he couldn't pretend this was another dream.

The serpent manifested on his skin now—a tattoo, black and white, minimalist shadows winding up his arm.

""This is why I hate snakes,"" Jack said to his empty apartment.

Someone knocked on the door.

Jack opened it. The organization stood there—the man in the suit and three others, all with the same forgettable faces.

""You're coming with us,"" the man said. No preamble, no courtesy. ""Now.""

Jack looked at his bleeding arm, at the serpent tattoo, at these people who'd conscripted him into a war he never asked to fight.

""What choice do I have?"" he said.

Part Two: The Work

The work was brutal and constant. Jack and the serpent—still unnamed, still a source of fear and resentment—were deployed to breaches across the country. Small tears in reality where things slipped through.

Most were hostile. Creatures of fang and claw and impossible geometries, driven by hunger or rage or simple confusion. Jack learned to speak their languages, to negotiate when possible, to fight when necessary.

The serpent would emerge—sometimes as a tattoo that came alive, sometimes from Jack's sleeve or collar or shadow. Shadowscale no longer destroyed Jack's flesh. The technique had evolved, becoming controlled, something they could use without sacrifice.

But it was never a partnership. The serpent commanded, Jack obeyed. Fight this. Kill that. Contain this breach. The work was always urgent, always necessary, and Jack had no leverage to question it.

Until Montana.

The breach was small, barely perceptible. The team surrounded the property of a small farm house, equipment humming, ready for containment and neutralization.

Jack approached the house alone, as always. Inside, in what had once been a living room, something waited.

It wasn't hostile. Jack could feel that immediately. The creature was small, maybe three feet tall, vaguely humanoid. It glowed with soft bioluminescence, colors shifting across its surface like oil on water.

Jack tried to summon the serpent. *We need to assess the threat.*

The serpent didn't respond.

The glowing creature looked at Jack, then past him, to where the serpent presumably resided. It spoke in that language of elsewhere, and Jack understood fragments: *friend, safe, hiding, please.*
Then the serpent responded, and Jack's whole body went rigid with the force of the conversation happening through him. Words he couldn't quite parse, emotion too complex for translation.

The creature knew the serpent. Personally.

*This one helped me*, the serpent said finally, voice quiet in Jack's mind. *When I was fleeing. They told me where to run.*

Jack turned toward where the team was positioning their equipment. Not for deportation. For *capture*. Nets, containment fields, instruments designed for study and experimentation.

""This wasn't part of the job,"" Jack said aloud.

The man in the suit approached. ""We need to understand them. Studying one could—""

""You said we kill immediate threats or send them back. Nobody said anything about prisoners.""

""Our protocols have—""

*Jack*, the serpent interrupted. *We need to leave. Now.*

""What?""

*This entity knows things about my world, about what happened there. If the humans capture them, if they learn certain things there will be war. Not just breaches and containment. Actual war between realities.*

The team was moving in, equipment active. Jack looked at the glowing creature, at the organization, at the impossible choice crystallizing in front of him.

""Tell me,"" Jack said to the serpent. ""Everything. Right now.""

They didn't speak until they were miles from the site, Jack driving a stolen car with hands that shook on the wheel. The serpent manifested partially—head emerging from Jack's collar, resting near his shoulder. Behind them, the glowing entity had vanished in a burst of light the moment the team closed in, scattering across dimensions before they could capture it. Whether that had been escape or destruction, Jack couldn't tell, and the serpent's silence suggested it didn't know either.

""I was not always formless,"" the serpent began. ""In my world, I had status. Purpose, perhaps. We were stewards of the boundaries between our realm and others.""

Jack kept his eyes on the road.

""My world wasn't like yours—it existed in harmonic layers, realities stacked like sheets of glass, each one vibrating at different frequencies. We could move between them, shape them. The sky was never one color but thousands, shifting with the resonance of thought itself.""

The serpent's voice carried weight Jack had never heard before—grief, ancient and absolute.

""There was a war. Not between worlds, but within mine. Factions that disagreed about how to manage the boundaries, about whether other realities should be isolated or integrated. The conflict escalated. Weapons were used that tore at the fabric of existence itself.""
""What happened to it?"" Jack asked quietly.
""My world ended. Not destroyed, but... fragmented. Scattered across the veil. Those of us who survived became refugees, hiding in the spaces between realities. I fled through whatever cracks I could find, and eventually I found you—dying in that cave, suspended between life and death, a perfect doorway.""

""You've been using me,"" Jack said.

""Yes. At first. But Jack these past months, working togetherI've learned what cooperation means in your world. I've been treating you as a tool when you're..."" The serpent paused. ""My name is Reggie.""

Jack almost laughed. ""Reggie?""

""In my language it means something else, but yes. Reggie.""

As the serpent spoke his name, the tattoo on Jack's arm began to change. The minimalist shadows erupted into color—emerald greens, deep blues, gold highlights. The serpent is rendered in full, beautiful detail.

Jack felt something shift inside him, a connection deepening. Reggie's perspective flowed into his mind, and suddenly Jack could process reality the way veil-creatures did—seeing the layers, the frequencies, the spaces between atoms where other worlds pressed close.

And Reggie gasped, experiencing physical reality fully for the first time—the weight of gravity, the texture of air, the strange beauty of linear time.

""We're bonded now,"" Reggie said quietly. ""Truly. Not host and passenger. Partners.""

""What about the entity? Your friend?""

""Gone. Whether they escaped or scattered themselves beyond recovery, I don't know. The math was impossible—if we'd fought, if we'd started that war..."" Reggie's form sagged. ""Sometimes there are no good choices. Only less terrible ones.""

Jack drove in silence for another hour, then pulled over at a rest stop. He looked at his arm, at the brilliant colors of Reggie's true form.

""Where do we go?"" Jack asked.

""Anywhere that isn't here. We have power now, Jack. Real power. But using it means choosing sides, and both sides will use us until there's nothing left.""

""So we just... leave?""

""We find peace with what we can't change. We accept that things could be better, but they could also be much, much worse.""

Jack started the car again and drove toward the horizon.
 Part Three: Between

They ended up in Norway after months of drifting. Jack took a job as a fire watcher in a remote tower deep in the northern forests, one of those positions that required long periods of solitude and careful attention to distant threats.

It suited them.

Reggie manifested less often now, content to exist as the colorful tattoo winding up Jack's arm. They spoke regularly, sometimes aloud, sometimes in the private space of Jack's mind. The conversations were easier now, without urgency or desperation.

Jack learned about Reggie's lost world—the beauty of it, the complexity. Reggie learned about human contradictions, about how something could be both mundane and precious, how boredom and peace often looked identical.

They still saw the breaches sometimes. Small ones, hairline cracks where things slipped through. Jack and Reggie would assess them together, and occasionally—when the creature was harmless, when the breach was minor—they'd help. A gentle push back through the veil, a word of guidance in that impossible language.

But they didn't fight. Didn't engage with the larger conflict. They'd chosen their neutrality and held to it like a vow.

Jack sat in the fire tower one evening, watching the sun set over endless trees. His arm itched slightly where the tattoo was, Reggie shifting beneath the skin.

""Do you miss it?"" Jack asked. ""Your world. Before the war.""

""Every day,"" Reggie said. ""But I have this now. You. This strange, heavy reality. It's not what I lost, but it's... something.""

""Yeah,"" Jack said. ""Something.""

The forest stretched out in all directions, vast and indifferent. Jack had spent his whole life feeling caught between worlds, never quite belonging anywhere. Now he was literally between realities, harboring a refugee from a dead world, and somehow it felt more honest than anything before.

Peace wasn't victory. Wasn't justice. Wasn't even happiness, exactly. It was just... acceptance. The understanding that you couldn't fix everything, couldn't save everyone, couldn't fight every war that demanded fighters.

Things could be better. They could also be worse.

For now, this was enough.
Jack was making coffee when he heard the footsteps on the tower stairs. Slow, deliberate, climbing with purpose.

Visitors were rare. The tower was miles from the nearest town, accessible only by rough trails. Jack set down his mug and moved to the window.

*Someone's coming*, Reggie said, alert now. *I can feel them. They're... strange.*

""Strange how?""

*Not human. Not exactly. But not from the veil either. Something else.*

The footsteps reached the platform. A knock, polite and measured.
Jack opened the door.
The man was tall—easily six and a half feet with black hair that fell to his shoulders. He wore clothes that looked normal but somehow weren't, like a costume designed by someone who'd only heard descriptions of human fashion. His face was pleasant, unremarkable.
Until he smiled.

His mouth opened *wrong*—too wide, extending past where the jaw should end, revealing too many teeth arranged in patterns that hurt to look at directly.

But the smile wasn't aggressive. Wasn't threatening. Just... present. An expression on a face that wasn't quite built for human expressions.

Jack's hand went to his arm instinctively, to where Reggie coiled beneath the skin. Reggie stayed quiet, watchful.

""Hello,"" the man said. His voice was pleasant, accent indeterminate. ""I hope I'm not intruding. I've been searching for you both for quite some time.""
""Who are you?"" Jack asked.

The man's smile softened into something almost genuine, and he extended one hand in greeting.

""My name is Mikal,"" he said.

They sat in the small kitchen area of the tower, Jack having reluctantly prepared a second cup of coffee. Mikal accepted it with a nod of thanks and settled into the chair with an ease that suggested he'd done this many times before appeared in someone's isolated sanctuary and made pleasant conversation.

""How did you find us?"" Jack asked, staying standing, keeping distance.

""I've been tracking veil signatures across Europe for the past few years,"" Mikal said, taking a sip. ""You two have a very particular resonance. Cooperative but cautious. It's... distinctive.""

*He can sense us from a distance*, Reggie observed privately. *That's not a small skill.*

""What do you want?"" Jack kept his voice neutral.

""Nothing ominous, I promise."" Mikal's smile returned, more controlled this time. ""I wanted to meet you. To let you know that there are others like us. That you're not as isolated as you might think.""

""We chose isolation,"" Jack said.

""I know. And that's valid."" Mikal set his mug down carefully. ""But choice is only meaningful when you know the alternatives exist. I'm not here to recruit you or change your mind. I'm here to offer information.""

Jack finally sat down, wary but curious. ""What kind of information?""

""I can sense breaches before they fully manifest,"" Mikal said. ""Usually twelve to forty-eight hours in advance, depending on the size. It's a skill that develops when you stay... engaged with the veil rather than withdrawing from it.""

*That would have been useful*, Reggie muttered.

""There are others?"" Jack asked. ""Other people like us?""

""A few. Not many. Most don't survive their first encounter, or they're absorbed by organizations that use them until there's nothing left."" Mikal's expression grew more serious. ""The ones who survive long enough to develop real capabilities, to achieve actual partnership with their veil-entities... we tend to find each other eventually.""
""And you all stay engaged? Keep fighting?""
""Some do. Some don't. There's no single path."" Mikal leaned back. ""But we share information. Warn each other about significant breaches. Offer support when needed.""

Jack studied him. ""Why tell us this now?""
""Because there's one coming,"" Mikal said simply. ""Soon. Close to here. I wanted to warn you, and I wanted you to know that help exists if you ever want it.""

*How close?* Reggie asked, tense now.

""Very,"" Mikal said, as if he'd heard Reggie directly. ""Within the next hour, I'd estimate. It's not small.""

Jack felt his stomach tighten. ""How big?""

""Big enough that I came in person.""

The tremor started fifty eight minutes later.

Jack was outside, scanning the forest with binoculars, when the trees began to bend wrong. Not wind—something else. Reality warping at the edges, folding in on itself like paper creasing under pressure.

Mikal stood on the tower platform, coffee mug in hand, watching with calm interest.

The breach opened between two massive pines, a vertical slash in the air that bled wrong colors—ultraviolet and infrared made visible, shades that shouldn't exist in the visible spectrum. Something pushed through.

It was massive. Fifteen feet tall, quadrupedal but with too many joints in each limb. Its surface seemed to shift between states—solid, liquid, something neither. No eyes that Jack could identify, but he felt its attention sweep across the clearing like searchlights.

The creature screamed, a sound that made Jack's ears ring and his vision blur.
*This is bad*, Reggie said. *This is very bad.*
Jack moved forward anyway, raising one hand. He spoke in the veil-language, words that twisted on his tongue. A greeting. An offer to help. The same approach that had worked before.

The creature's head snapped toward him and it charged.
Jack dove aside, barely avoiding the impact as the thing's bulk crashed into the space he'd occupied. Trees splintered. The ground cracked.

*We need to try Shadowscale*, Reggie said.
""It's too big—""
*We don't have a choice!*
Jack extended his bleeding hand—he'd cut it on something during the dive—and felt Reggie's presence surge forward. The serpent's head emerged from his sleeve, massive and coiled, and bit down on Jack's palm.

The pain brought clarity. Jack raised his hand and said: ""Shadowscale.""

His skin lifted from his arm, transforming mid-flight into those smoking projectiles. They struck the creature's flank and detonated, each impact creating brief wounds that sealed almost immediately.

The creature staggered but didn't fall. It turned toward Jack again, slower this time but no less hostile.

Jack tried again, pouring more power into it. More scales, more detonations. Reggie emerged further, wrapping around Jack's torso for stability, lending strength.

It was working. Barely. The creature was wounded, confused, and stumbling.
But Jack was exhausted. His arm was shredded, blood running freely. Reggie's form was flickering, unstable from overexertion.

The creature gathered itself for another charge.

*Jack—*
A soft sound, like fabric tearing.

Mikal walked down the tower stairs, coffee mug still in hand. He moved with unhurried purpose, stepping past Jack without acknowledging him, approaching the creature directly.

The creature roared and swung one massive limb.

Mikal raised his free hand and made a gesture—fingers moving in a pattern that hurt to track, angles that folded into themselves.

The creature stopped mid-swing.

Its form began to... collapse wasn't the right word. *Fold*. Like reality was origami and Mikal knew exactly where the creases were. The creature's mass compressed, twisted, folded in on itself in geometries that shouldn't be possible.
The breach in the air pulsed, resonating with whatever Mikal was doing.

The creature folded smaller, smaller, until it was the size of a baseball, then a marble, then nothing at all. The breach sealed behind it with a sound like a cork popping.

Silence.

Mikal returned to the tower stairs and picked up his coffee mug from where he'd set it on the railing. Still warm. He took a sip.

Jack stood there, breathing hard, arm hanging useless at his side. Reggie had retracted completely, exhausted beyond words.

""What,"" Jack managed, ""did you just do?""

""Folded it back,"" Mikal said calmly. ""The veil has creases, weak points. If you understand the geometry, you can encourage things to return through them."" He studied Jack's wounded arm with clinical interest. ""Your approach was solid. This one was just too far gone to negotiate with.""

Reggie manifested partially, head emerging near Jack's shoulder, visibly drained. ""How long have you been able to do that?""

""A few years. It took practice. And company."" Mikal's smile returned. ""Hard to develop techniques like that alone.""
The implication hung in the air between them.

Jack pressed his good hand against his bleeding arm, trying to slow the flow. ""That was... you made it look easy.""

""It's not,"" Mikal said. ""But I've had time to refine it. And I've had others to learn from, to practice with."" He finished his coffee and set the mug down. ""You two are strong. What you've built together is impressive, especially in isolation. But there are limits to what you can develop without...""

""Community,"" Jack said quietly.
""Yes.""

They stood in silence for a moment. The forest was already returning to normal, the warped trees straightening, the torn ground smoothing over. Reality reasserting itself.

""I should go,"" Mikal said. ""You'll want to tend to that arm, and I have another potential breach to track in Finland."" He reached into his jacket and produced a simple white card. Plain, no decoration. Just a phone number written in neat black ink.

He held it out.
Jack took it with his good hand.

""If you ever want to talk to someone who understands,"" Mikal said. ""Or if you want to know more about the others. Or if you just want warning when the big ones are coming."" He paused. ""No pressure. Your peace here is real and valuable. I'm just offering alternatives.""

""Thank you,"" Jack said, and meant it.

Mikal nodded once, then turned and walked down the trail into the forest. His form blurred at the edges, and within a dozen steps he was gone not invisible, just... elsewhere. Traveling through the veil itself rather than walking the long miles back to civilization.

Jack looked down at the card in his hand. Just a number. No name, no context. He could throw it away. Could burn it. Could forget this ever happened.

*What are you thinking?* Reggie asked quietly.
""I'm thinking,"" Jack said, ""that I like our life here. The quiet. The peace. I don't want to be Mikal, constantly engaged, constantly fighting.""
*But?*
""But it's good to know there's a choice."" Jack limped back into the tower, card still in hand. ""That we're choosing this. Not just defaulting to it because we don't know what else exists.""
He set the card on the small table by his bed. Didn't hide it. Didn't display it prominently. Just... there. Present. Possible.
Outside, the forest was silent and still. No breaches, no tremors, no impossible creatures. Just trees and wind and the vast Norwegian sky.
Jack made himself another cup of coffee, bandaged his arm with supplies from the first aid kit, and returned to his watch.

The tower had stopped being a hiding place a long time ago. But now, with that card sitting on his bedside table, it felt even more like a home. A place he was choosing, not a place he was trapped in.
 that made all the difference.

I've been an apprentice home barista for a few months. I'm loving this journey, and I have developed a more or less consistent workflow for dealing in coffees, exploring taste, etc.

A parallel area of focus I would like to consider is how to keep my coffee station clean. I am not referring to maintaining and servicing the grinder/coffee machine, as I have infos on this.

At the moment I'm satisfied with the taste of my coffees and cappuccinos, but my workflow creates a fair amount of mess and dirt. I know that this is a bit a of a dirty business, but I'm looking at ways to improve, and suggestions to minimise dirt, or getting to know your practices.

I can start with a couple of things that annoy me, below

I use two microfibre cloths, one for the steam wand, and one for the porterfilter and the rest. The latter gets really dirty, really soon. I typically use this as follows:

\* after knocking my puck in a knock box, there are always leftovers coffee beans, which I remove with this cloth, and this means that chunks of the puck stick to the cloth, once fragmented.

\* I use the same cloth also to clean the shower after every shot (after I run a clean shot without the porterfilter).

Take a look at the first picture (left and top-left part of the bottom cloth). That was a clean cloth which I started to use this morning. I can't help but thinking that that cloth is now going to \*produce mess\* in my shower, rather than cleaning it. Also, because the cloth is damp, I have constantly humidity on my counter, together with coffee particles, which are essentially hard to remove with the brush I have.

It feels like I should change one cloth a day!

https://preview.redd.it/ivtie3juqveg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cefcffbd450bcd253c3d6bc23a7ab87a96c92bed

Another thing that annoys me is pictured below:

https://preview.redd.it/1guhsgvhrveg1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c7e26bfad6f62ba091f3fd5e3b666e353963f556

You can see coffee particles on the Normcore coffee station (see humidity there too, on the left, coming from the spouted porterfilter, as well us underneath the Normcore Tamper.

Another thing that I'm really annoyed at is cleaning the portafilter after the extraction. The knockbox I have lets me knock 90%, and sometimes 99% of the puck. But I always have to remove some coffee after that, so where and how do I remove it? In my case I try to either use the cloth to push the coffee in the knock box or to push it in a nearby water sink. The former typically  results in coffee powder being spread on the counter, as I can not seem to reliably put it in the knock box; the latter means moving the porterfilter around. The porterfilter has inevitably dripping spouts... Aaaargh!

How do you deal with all these and related aspects in your workflow? I am not after a completely spotless workflow of course, but rather best practice to incorporate in my workflow that let me minimise mess, and have an acceptable kitchen corner. You are welcome to assume no aptitude whatsoever: I am a very goofy person, wanting to improve and think of best practices.

1qjricd,https://www.reddit.com/r/Eragon/comments/1qjricd/ideas_for_spells_enchantments_and_other_such/,"Ideas For Spells, Enchantments, and other such Madness","You read the title. Possible spoilers (and a couple direct mentions) for the entirety of the Inheritance Cycle, The Fork The Witch and The Worm, and Murtagh.

And I don't want this post to just be about me. I also want to hear ideas for spells from all of you.

Also fair warning, I go on a long tirade on how to make Dragon Rider's (practically) invincible by combining a fair few spells in an unconventional way that's gonna take up most of this post, before that let's start in shallower waters.

Tiny pellets enchanted with the word *Thrysta* (Thrust, to compress). We see both Eragon, and later on >!Murtagh!<, use this spell to kill their targets with nothing but a rock. Tiny metal pellets, needles, or pins could be enchanted with much more energy before hand, creating basically a mini-shotgun blast that could quickly overwhelm wards and pierce even heavy armor.

They could be hidden inside gauntlets or embedded in armor, or simply sitting in a pouch. And, unlike the pellets from actual shotguns, could be called back for repeat use.

Hell. We see Rhunön use spells to make Eragon's arm strike precisely where he needs to when forging Brisingr, and in Murtagh, >!Murtagh enchants his arrows to make sure they always hit their mark!<. So not only could these pellets shred anyone in it's path and be recalled at will, but they would also curve around corners and battlements. Hell you could even do it on purpose in a battlefield, by targeting archers in the back so the pellets would have to go through the soldiers in front of you.

Next up following a similar logic, half masks enchanted with *Thrysta*. But instead of covering the top half of the face, they would cover the bottom half and the nose. They would be adjustable and would automatically adhere to the target's mouth and nose as if it was always a part of their skin.

Similar to the >!Tangle Box from Murtagh!< these masks obviously prevents spellcasters from speaking and breathing. This would make spellcasting extremely difficult (if not impossible, since casting spells without the Ancient Language is a well kept secret), and combined with the lack of air, it would be a struggle for even Arya, Eragon, and Murtagh to fend off in the moment. And to make them additionally anti-magician, the inside could be laced with a heavy dose of >!Vorgethan!<, the anti-magic poison used on Eragon in Gil'ead, and >!Murtagh throughout his imprisonment by the Draumari!<.

It's also something that is very difficult to ward against without interfering with everyday life. These masks are meant to be worn similar to armor or clothing, and they aren't striking with lethal force like an arrow. They also don't harm directly. Creating a ward that prevents anything from covering your face would also prevent you from wearing helmets or masks, or even diving underwater.

Even still they could be given extra energy so if nothing else, if they were batted off by a ward, they would at least drain the magicians energy in the process.

And a few ideas for some anti-magic wards I cooked up:

A ward where whenever someone tries to cast a spell that would harm me or negatively affect me, they forget the words of the Ancient Language.

Whenever someone tries to cast a spell that would harm me or negatively affect me, remove the air around them.

If someone attempts to cast a harmful spell against me or negatively affect me, first siphon the energy from that spell into a gem in my possession before the spell can be completed.

The last one is particularly powerful since it's not targeting the magician or countering their spell directly, simply diverting their power somewhere else. Plus if it's a particularly expensive spell they cast, they would very quickly kill themselves before they have a chance to end the flow of energy.

And now that the Name of Names is known (if only by a select few), one could technically ward against the Ancient Language in its entirety. This is a double edged sword. On one hand this would protect you from every single magical attack possible. However as seen in >!Murtagh, it doesn't protect against wordless magic!<, and it also means it would protect you from all magical influence. Even something as simple as scrying.

It would be a near constant drain on your energy reserves since, frankly, anyone who knows the Name of Names is definitely not living a quiet life. And if it was ever revealed, your enemies could simply kill you just by trying to scry you all at once.

Another ward I'm surprised I haven't seen before, especially in the book Murtagh after how >!Galbatorix abused his True Name!<, is enchanting your True Name so you need to know a password to activate it. So you would need to know both the True Name and the current password or code phrase in order to gain sovereignty over it.

A simple yet clever enchantment. And you could add as many passwords as you want. Or even require physical tasks or labors in conjunction with the password.

They could be as simple as making a hand-gesture of respect. Or as complicated as touching a specific rock at the bottom of the ocean. Or as twisted as being forced to kill whoever you care about the most.

You could make it so the password shifts every moment so only you know what it is. Or any combination thereof, making it practically impossible for anyone to use your True Name against you, even if they take ahold of your mind via telepathy.

Another one I'm surprised I haven't seen mention of is are variations of Elva's curse. Elva was cursed, by accident, by what can only be described as a noob when it came to magic in Eragon. And I don't see why a much safer, controlled, and simultaneously broader version couldn't be articulated by an experienced spellcaster.

The only possible downside is the drain on the body. As Elva is noted to be constantly eating after she is cursed, to the point it's almost all she can think about.

However, 1. Elva wasn't fully grown and her body is overcompensating and forcing her to grow far faster than she normally would. in The Fork, The Witch, and The Worm, >!despite only being 4 years old, the book states she looks at least 10!<. And 2. Her curse effects everyone around her in a \*massive\* vicinity. She is able to feel the pain of everyone around her, allies and enemies, during the Battle of Tronjheim, The Burning Plains, and the other skirmishes the Varden endured. And she consistently able to feel the pains of the thousands of Varden soldiers on their marches. Plus 3. She's simply not as strong as Dragon Rider.

For a Dragon and their Rider, the spell could be limited by who they are currently in mental contact with. Meaning it would always include themselves and their dragon, and could include allies and enemies alike. This is particularly useful against your enemies since you would basically know in advance whether an attack would harm them or not, and would allow them to adjust the range of the spell on the fly without needing to speak the Ancient Language.

And with a broader definition, such as \*danger\* or \*adverse effects\*, the spell could also warn you of traps that would well... trap you instead of directly killing you. Or whether you would starve or die of thirst on a long journey.

This would be limiting for stealth engagements (such as Eragon's into Dras-Leona), where you want your mind hidden. You could always hypothetically manually add targets to the spell, but that would be a pain to do in the middle of a fight.

You could also do the spell in reverse. How to deal the most damage at any moment. Allowing you to know where a structure or defense is weak, lapses in an opponent's fighting style, or if you're lucky, even a glimpse on how to subvert an enemy's wards. Similar to whitehackers this would also be helpful even when targeting your allies, as it could allow them to guard against future attacks.

And now I've run out of ideas... except for the long winded spell combo that would make Dragon Rider's invincible via enchanted armor and weapons. Before I get to that however I have 1 more spell idea, but it's related to armor/weapons so I'm putting them in the same section.

It's a simple enchantment really that could be put on hammers, arrows, swords, spears, etc. Anything that \*kills\*. Basically, the enchantment would siphon the energy from anything it kills, as long as it gives more energy than it costs to send it back (mainly to prevent trying to siphon something defended by wards or is too far away).

As we see Eragon do to the animals that are butchered on the Varden's march from city to city, dying creatures still have most of their energy, and that energy may as well not go to waste. This would make Dragon Rider's seemingly tireless on the battlefield and very well might end up having a larger store of energy by the end than the beginning. As long as wards don't prevent them from draining the energy, but even then most wards automatically end if the target is killed (no use wasting energy on a corpse), and the swords of Dragon Riders already have anti-magic properties, just to a lesser extent than the Dauthderts.

And now for the long winded bit. Enough teasing let's get on with it.

First you have to displace the weight of weapons or armor. The weight of the armament still exists, just in a different place. I'm not sure exactly how you would word it, but basically during the forging process the weight of a sword, breastplate, chainmail, etc would instead be tied to a piece of furniture, molecule of dirt. or a section of floor in a house, which would gain that much weight in turn as their structure was fundamentally altered.

If done correctly this would allow Dragon Rider's and their Dragon's to wear even the heaviest of armors without having to deal with any additional stress from the weight. Although the *mass* of the object still exists, so Dragon's would still have to deal with the wind resistance while they're flying. A fair tradeoff.

The armor/weapons then could be folded inside of a ring, necklace, or other piece of clothing/jewelry via Umaroth's space folding technique. The technique is complicated and dangerous, but if Eragon with only a little over a year of training can do it, then future Dragon Rider's absolutely could. And with that, weapons and armor could be hidden in plain sight, and recalled with nothing but a word or a thought.

But let's take this a step further. Let's make it so a Dragon or Dragon Rider never has to take their armor off. Let's make the already weightless armor translucent by enchanting it so light goes through them as if they were made out of perfect glass. Outside of a reflective effect around the edges, the armor would be completely see through and the Rider would still be able to feel starlight on their skin. Now that it's translucent \*and\* weightless, the armor would have no need for slits or openings to see, and with magic and fantastical materials it could be made to be supernaturally flexible so there would be no need for gaps in the armor.

And to finish it off, we'll give the armor the ability to shift and concentrate it's mass throughout it's structure. With these 3 effects the armor would then serve basically as an invisible ward-like structure made physical, an impenetrable barrier between Rider and the outside world.

It would work as a filter similar to how wards do. Poisonous food, air, and drink would never make it to their lips. Physical attacks, arrows, punches, kicks, axes, polearms, swords, etc. All blocked by the combined might of the armor and magic, just like wards. Yet if a magician tried to pierce it they would find it impossible. But a Rider could still sit in a chair, lay in a soft bed, and receive healing if needed as the armor would only activate when needed or at the command of its wearer.

And to prevent unforeseen threats from getting through the armor that were not listed when it was forged, the armor would activate whenever anything it's wearer perceives as a threat, or whatever an enemy thinks is an attack.

But no, there's more we can do. We can make the armor, weapons, and clothes of dragon riders immune to extreme heat just like Rhunön's aprons. And since they can be made immune to extreme heat, nothing should stop us from making them immune to the cold as well. And since the armor already has no gaps to speak of, the armor could filter heat and cold just as well. Meaning a dragon rider and their dragon wrapped in this invisible sheath could fly from the highest peaks and through lava and dragon-fire without issue.

To further enhance it, it'll only take yaknow... the Name of Name's. With the name of the Ancient Language in tow, Dragon Rider smith's in the future could force armor and weapons to bend to their will, and gain true names by force. Albitr (or Twinkledeath as Angela lovingly called it), was the ""archetype of the incline plane"" and could cut through anything.

Future Dragon Rider Smith's could enchant swords with similar effects, giving them the true name *Kverst* (to cut), *Skölir* (shield) for armor, and I'm sure much much more. Combine those techniques with Rider's who directly studied under Rhunön, and guidance from the elder Eldunarí and their understandings of the universe, one could create weapons that defy imagination and put even Brisingr to shame.

And obviously if the spells that make the Dauthderts anti-magic dragon killers get reversed throw those on too. Cause why not?

This would also mean future dragon rider's wouldn't have to rely on more brightsteel falling from the sky, as they could alter the true name of any forged sword with enough time and energy.

Plus once one suit of armor was created, the smith would know the spells, how they worked, and how much energy it costs, they could recreate it without the Ancient Language, perhaps even in concert with other Dragon Rider's or Eldunarí. And as we know from Murtagh >!wordless magic is immune to the Name of Name's!<. And with multiple Dragon Rider's all enchanting one piece of armor, their varying perspectives and understandings would layer on top of each other and grant the armor protections that one interpretation lacked.

So in total you have invisible, weightless armor, that can be made way thicker and heavier than any armor ever ought to be, crafted combining the knowledge of Rhunön, the smartest and oldest Eldunarí, the Name of Names, and multiple Dragon Riders. It would be invincibility materialized.

But we're not done yet. More space folding! Umaroth didn't die so future Dragon Rider's could starve or die of thirst.

Waterskins enchanted to be portals to vast quantities of pure, cold drinking water, filtered pure from the salted oceans. Pouches filled with food perfectly preserved in demi-planes where bacteria and other nasties can't exist. This would allow them to carry enough food and water for entire armies, which would make even a single Dragon Rider worth more than gold during war.

And hey in case they get captured, air canisters with months worth of air captured from the peaks of Beor Mountains. Cold and fresh. So even if they're trapped at the bottom of the ocean, or in a room full of poisonous gas, they can still breath completely unhindered.

But eventually they'll run out of food. Let's fix that. Let's fold an entire ranch or farm into a space the size of a ball of lint. The Eldunarí are living beings and they survived the process just fine. The only issue would be getting fresh air and sunlight into such a space.

Sunlight would be no issue. In Murtagh, >!Murtagh concentrated the light in the air around him in a single spot, and it was so bright it nearly blinded him. And it costed him next to no energy. He did this again when he was half-dead from his fight with Bachel, on a much bigger scale, and he didn't overextend from the effort despite being in the process of bleeding out.!< The combined energy of the plants and animals could charge the energy for the spell easy without them even noticing.

No the bigger issue is air. But even still wind is one of the easiest elements to manipulate. It's a gas. The whole point of gases is they're too full of energy to sit still. They already want to move. Directing them into the pocket dimension shouldn't be *too* taxing. Especially if a Dragon Rider has even just one Eldunarí on them. And similarly once the ranch/farm is up and running, a thimblesworth of energy from thousands of plants and hundreds of animals should be more than enough to fuel that spell as well.

And if I'm wrong, two air canisters. One for the Rider and one for the Ranch.

And finally let's steal from Dune. Stillsuits. The armor is an enclosed space after all. As they say on the ISS, yesterday's piss is today's coffee. Sweat and tears could be filtered through magic leaving nothing but clear water behind so as little resources are wasted as possible.

And...and... that's it... I'm officially out of ideas on how to break the Ancient Language.

\- Water dispenser (Hot, Cold)

\- Bean to cup coffee machine (90 cups per day)

  
Clients either go out for lunch or bring packed food in stainless steel containers. In my observation, microwave is redundant.



Questions:

1. How do i track the coffee machine usage? I want to limit 1 coffee per client a day to keep my consumables cost under limit.

2. Any must-haves in pantry which i am missing out?

1qjre5x,https://www.reddit.com/r/cults/comments/1qjre5x/is_it_a_bad_idea_to_keep_meeting_with_someone_who/,Is it a bad idea to keep meeting with someone who is in a cult?,"So I live in a country (as a foreigner) that’s known for cults. Cult members love approaching foreigners, but I usually don’t entertain them.

About a month ago, a girl came up to me and said she was doing research about foreigners in this country. She also asked if I was Christian, which kind of gave it away, but I decided to help her anyway. I was curious whether it was real research. I’ve helped foreign students with research before in exchange for money or gift cards, but those people never approached me randomly on the street.

She added me on a messaging app and tried to set up a meeting at a restaurant, which immediately struck me as odd. She also said she wanted to befriend a foreigner, but getting dinner still felt strange since the meeting was supposed to be for research. After the first meeting (which ended up being at a café because I insisted on that instead of dinner), it solidified my belief that her research is fake and that she’s in a cult. She claims she’s not in school and that she’s working on this research independently. It supposedly has something to do with psychology and theology. Allegedly, she just spends her days reading and working on it.

We’ve met for coffee three times now (today was the third). I actually tried to slow-fade her, but she keeps texting me until I respond. She tried to get me to go to a language exchange (a very common way they recruit foreigners here) that happens every Tuesday. I kept telling her I couldn’t go that week and that I’d let her know when I could. She’d say okay, then text again a few hours later asking if I could go anyway—even after I already said I couldn’t and that I’d let her know about the next one. This happened repeatedly until I agreed to meet her instead. She even said, “If you can’t go to the language exchange, can we meet this week?”

It’s very obvious she’s trying hard to keep the conversation going. With the responses I’m giving, most people would’ve given up, but she texts me every day. I’m lowkey curious, and I’m pretty sure I know which cult she’s part of. Each time we meet, she talks a little more about religion. Today was the most so far. When she talks about religion, her face lights up. I can also tell she’s trying really hard to appear friendly and like she likes me, which makes sense since that’s how they recruit people—because there’s no way this girl is actually entertained by me lol.

I’m curious about why she joined the cult. This is just my own curiosity—I’m not interested in joining or believing in any gods or supernatural stuff. I don’t know if I should just say something like, “I know you’re part of S**, and I don’t want to join, but good luck,” or if I should keep meeting her until she talks more about it and why she joined. What I mean is, I don’t know if what I’m doing is wrong since I know she’s in a cult. Technically, she hasn’t said she is, though.

Most people I know here either resign themselves to drinking the tap water or buy enormous quantities of bottled water. I don’t like to buy plastic water bottles if I can avoid it, but we’re getting a bit worried about the long term impacts of this quantity of calcium consumption in every single thing we eat or drink (soup, pasta water, coffee, etc. all come from the tap). Specifically for one of my roommates, who has a liver problem, drinking the very calcium-heavy water is not a sustainable option, and she currently buys cases of bottled water every week, but we would love to find a way to change that.

I’ve been looking into water softening systems, but people are saying they should bypass drinking water/the kitchen entirely when installed. Is this true? Are there risks to drinking softened water? Are there other water softening/filtering alternatives?

Our other issue is that we live in a rented apartment and have the budgets of people in their mid-20s working service jobs, and can’t drop hundreds of dollars on a full house filter for the apartment we’re leasing for 2 years. The hard water for bathing isn’t ideal, but we don’t really care. We would love to find a solution just for drinking and cooking water!

Before arriving in Ho Chi Minh City, I was a bit anxious about everyday things: cash, crowded places, taxis, language barriers and especially the risk of losing my wallet or being distracted in busy areas.

So instead of carrying my physical cards everywhere, I decided to rely mostly on a virtual payment card on my phone mainly for safety, not just to “try something new.”

*From day one in HCMC, I used my phone to pay for:*

\- GrabBike and GrabCar

\- Cafés and restaurants

\- Convenience stores

\- Shopping malls

At first, I was nervous. I expected awkward moments, declined payments, or confused cashiers. But every time, I just unlocked my phone, tapped, and it worked.

What surprised me most:

Contactless payments are much more common than I expected

I barely had to take my wallet out

In crowded areas, paying with just my phone felt faster and safer

One morning I accidentally left my wallet in the hotel. I only realized later in the day but I still managed to move around, eat, drink coffee, and get back without any problems.

*There were a few limitations:*

\- Small street vendors still mostly accept cash

\- Low battery becomes a real source of stress

Overall, using a virtual card made navigating Ho Chi Minh City much easier and safer than I expected. The city is busy and chaotic, but also surprisingly digital-friendly.

1qjr6zh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MomentumOne/comments/1qjr6zh/how_to_be_disgustingly_rich_in_2026_the/,# How to Be Disgustingly RICH in 2026: The Psychology Behind Kevin Hart's Wealth-Building Grind,"Look, I'm tired of seeing the same recycled advice about building wealth. ""Save 10% of your income."" ""Cut out your daily coffee."" ""Invest in index funds."" That's not wrong, but it's painfully incomplete. After diving deep into Kevin Hart's interview about doing 28 comedy sets per weekend early in his career, plus researching what actually separates millionaires from everyone else through podcasts like My First Million, books from wealth researchers, and interviews with self-made entrepreneurs, I realized most people are being fed a sanitized version of wealth building that leaves out the most critical parts.

The uncomfortable truth? The people who build serious wealth aren't just working harder. They're operating by completely different rules that nobody talks about in personal finance subreddits.

**1. Volume creates luck, and luck creates wealth**

Kevin Hart wasn't doing 28 sets because he loved bombing on stage or driving between shitty comedy clubs at 2am. He was manufacturing opportunities for luck to find him. Every set was a lottery ticket. More sets meant more chances for the right person to be in the audience, more reps to develop his craft, more probability that something would click.

This applies everywhere. The YouTuber who posts 100 videos isn't just ""working hard"", they're generating 100 separate chances to go viral. The entrepreneur who pitches 50 investors isn't being rejected 47 times, they're creating 50 opportunities to find their Yes.

Meanwhile most people take one shot, get discouraged, and wonder why success never found them. Volume is the cheat code nobody wants to hear about because it sounds exhausting. It is.

**2. Wealthy people monetize their learning curve**

Here's what's wild about Hart's story. He wasn't just getting better at comedy during those 28 sets, he was getting PAID while improving. Probably not much at first, but something. Compare that to someone spending $50k on a college degree before earning their first dollar in their field.

The book ""The Millionaire Fastlane"" by MJ DeMarco (bestselling entrepreneur who built and sold a tech company) breaks this down brilliantly. DeMarco argues most people are stuck in the ""slowlane"", trading time for money in jobs that have built-in speed limits on their income. This book will make you question everything you think you know about financial advice. It's harsh and direct, but it rewires how you think about building wealth.

The pattern with wealthy people: they find ways to get paid while they learn, even if it's less money initially. They're testing business ideas with customers before investing heavily. They're freelancing in their field before committing to formal education. They're failing forward with skin in the game.

**3. The Compound Effect is real but nobody has the patience for it**

28 sets a weekend. Let's do math. That's roughly 1,400 sets per year. Over five years, that's 7,000 performances. You'd have to be absolute dogshit at comedy to not become world-class after 7,000 reps.

""The Compound Effect"" by Darren Hardy (former publisher of SUCCESS Magazine) is the best book I've ever read on this concept. Hardy shows how small, consistent actions compound into massive results, but only if you stick with them long enough. Most people quit right before the hockey stick growth happens. The book is filled with practical examples of how tiny daily decisions create dramatically different life outcomes. Insanely good read that changed how I think about daily habits.

The wealth application: someone who learns basic investing principles and consistently puts money into assets for 20 years will almost certainly become a millionaire. But it requires doing boring things consistently while your friends are buying new cars and taking luxury vacations.

The side hustle that makes $200/month Year 1, $800/month Year 2, $2,500/month Year 3 looks stupid to quit your job for... until it's making $15k/month in Year 5.

**4. You need asymmetric upside opportunities**

Here's the thing about Hart's comedy grind. His downside was capped (wasted time, embarrassment, maybe some gas money), but his upside was theoretically unlimited. One great set in front of the right person could change everything.

Most people structure their lives with capped upside. Salary jobs, hourly work, trading time for money. You know exactly what you'll make, which feels safe but guarantees you'll never become wealthy unless you're in a very high-paying field.

""Skin in the Game"" by Nassim Taleb (scholar, former options trader, and one of the most important thinkers on risk) explores this concept of asymmetric payoffs. Taleb argues you want to be in positions where you have small downside and massive upside. He calls this having ""optionality."" The writing is dense but incredibly insightful about how to think about risk and reward differently than conventional wisdom suggests.

Wealthy people seek these asymmetric bets constantly. Starting a business with low initial investment. Creating content that could go viral. Learning high-value skills that could 10x their income. Investing in assets that could appreciate significantly. They're fine with most bets not working out because they only need a few to hit.

**5. Your network determines your net worth, but building it requires actual value exchange**

Hart became friends with other comedians, club owners, promoters. Those relationships opened doors that talent alone couldn't. But here's what's missing from typical networking advice: he had something to offer them too. He was a guy willing to show up and do a set when someone cancelled. He was reliable. He made the room laugh.

The app Lunchclub can be surprisingly good for meeting people in your industry who are actually doing interesting things (way better than random LinkedIn cold messages). It matches you with relevant people for virtual coffee chats based on your goals and background.

Real networking isn't collecting business cards or adding randoms on LinkedIn. It's becoming someone other valuable people want to know. That requires being good at something, being generous with your knowledge and connections, and showing up consistently.

**6. Wealthy people have a different relationship with failure**

28 sets a weekend means Hart was probably eating shit on stage regularly, especially early on. Most people experience failure and interpret it as a sign they should stop. Successful people experience failure and interpret it as data.

""Mindset"" by Carol Dweck (Stanford psychologist, groundbreaking research on achievement) distinguishes between fixed and growth mindsets. Growth mindset people see failure as information and opportunity to improve. Fixed mindset people see it as evidence of their limitations. This single mental shift is probably worth more than any tactical wealth building advice. The book is backed by decades of research but written in an accessible way that makes you want to completely rewire your thinking.

The wealth building connection: every failed business, bad investment, or rejected pitch is education you paid for with experience instead of tuition. The question is whether you actually learn from it.

**7. Compression of time through intensity**

Most people think building wealth takes 30-40 years because they're thinking linearly. Work job, save some money, retire at 65. That math checks out if you're following conventional advice.

But Hart compressed what might take someone else 20 years into 5-7 years through sheer intensity. He didn't work 40 hours a week on comedy, he probably worked 80-100 hours. He didn't do one set per week, he did 28.

""The 10X Rule"" by Grant Cardone (real estate mogul and sales trainer) argues most people underestimate the effort required to achieve their goals by a factor of 10. It's admittedly over the top in places, but the core message is valuable. If you want results 10x faster, you need to put in 10x the effort and take 10x the action. Not for everyone, but for people serious about accelerating wealth building, it's a useful framework.

This obviously isn't sustainable forever and can lead to burnout if you're not careful. But strategic seasons of intensity, especially when you're young and have fewer obligations, can dramatically accelerate your trajectory.

**8. The meta skill is learning what to focus on**

Hart focused on comedy. All in. He didn't split his time between comedy, acting auditions, and a backup career in accounting ""just in case."" That singular focus allowed him to improve faster and create more opportunities in one domain.

""Essentialism"" by Greg McKeown (leadership consultant who's worked with companies like Apple and Google) is probably the most important book about focus I've encountered. McKeown argues that success comes from doing less but better. The disciplined pursuit of less. In a world that's constantly telling you to diversify and hedge your bets, this book makes the case for going deep on what matters most.

Most people trying to build wealth are scattered. They're trying to start three different side hustles, invest in five different asset classes they don't understand, and learn six different skills simultaneously. The wealthy people I've researched tend to go deep on one or two things until they achieve mastery and real returns, then expand.

The path isn't complicated. Find something with asymmetric upside, get extremely good at it through massive volume, be patient enough for compound effects, build relationships with other people doing interesting things, and learn from every failure. The catch is it requires an intensity and consistency that most people aren't willing to sustain.

Nobody's lying to you about index funds and saving money. That advice works. But it's incomplete. The people building serious wealth are playing a completely different game with different rules, and they're putting in volume that looks unreasonable to everyone else until it works.",2,1769078107.0,MomentumOne,0,1.0,False
