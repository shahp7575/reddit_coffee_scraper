1ljoksb,https://www.reddit.com/r/pregnant/comments/1ljoksb/are_my_symptoms_indicative_of_pregnancy/,Are my symptoms indicative of pregnancy?,"(I’m sorry in advance for this incredibly long post). I’m a young female who has struggled with PCOS since I was 13 years old. I’ve been experiencing a few symptoms recently and I can’t tell if they have to do with my hormonal imbalances worsening or if they’re pregnancy symptoms. 

Despite my PCOS I have only ever missed a period for two months once, which is what led me to going to the doctor and getting diagnosed initially. My periods are very long and excruciating, typically lasting between 7-10 days with debilitating PMS that usually lasts up to two weeks. Because of this I think it’s fair to assume that my having missed a period last month is suspicious. I have still yet to get my period or experience my typical PMS symptoms but have instead developed a few others. 

For starters, seemingly out of nowhere, I’ve developed an aversion to any pork product (as a Cuban-American my parents find this insulting). After my sudden aversion to pork came my occasional nausea that typically lasts from the time I wake up (6:00 a.m.) to 1:00 p.m. and then comes back around at about 4:00 p.m. and lasts until I go to sleep. I’ve experienced this nausea on and off for about two weeks now, but had yet to throw up until two days ago. I’ve also been experiencing body aches and swelling in my knees which is something I haven’t dealt with in about 7 years. To accompany my body aches and swollen joints was a new pain in my lower back that was aching and affected the way I slept. My body temperature has also been incredibly inconsistent, one second I feel like I’m boiling and the next I need to turn off all ACs and fans in my house. WARNING: this next section is very TMI. I’m not somebody who struggles with digestive issues typically, but in the past 3 weeks I started experiencing terrible constipation which has now turned into diarrhea. I’ve also been waking up bloated but it feels different then my previous bloating (doctors suspect that I could have Endometriosis- I have yet to be diagnosed but my bloating is typically more like painful swelling and this is very different from that). Now I myself typically drink an exorbitant amount of coffee on a daily basis and love everything that has to do with the art of coffee making and consuming, but today when my partner got in the car with his hot latte ready to go I nearly spewed. The scent was enough to make me gag so much so that I had to roll the windows down. TMI over! 

Some other symptoms include increased acne, unstable moods/overly emotional (for example, I made a sexual joke to my partner that he laughed at and flattered him but I started sobbing because I didn’t want him to think I’m only sexually interested in him), extreme exhaustion/fatigue that again, could be a symptom of my hormonal imbalances worsening but seems unusual paired with these other symptoms. I’ve also felt “rounder” than before. When I gain weight it typically manifests in my arms or in rolls on my back but my stomach has suddenly become rounder around the bottom (near my pelvis) and I feel a stretching sensation on either side of my stomach. The last symptom, which is the one that led to me writing this post, is that I started smelling Play-Doh out of nowhere. There are no children around me and I haven’t seen or been near any Play-Doh since I was about 14 years old. I once heard of these kinds of things being potential pregnancy symptoms but regardless. Do you think it’s worth taking a pregnancy test?",1,1750802985.0,pregnant,1,1.0,False
1ljokd1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1ljokd1/what_are_your_thoughts_about_music_and_phone/,What are your thoughts about music and phone calls on speaker in pubic? I am legitimately confused.,"I thought it was common understanding that music or TV on speaker or talking on speaker phone in public places like the gym, coffee shops, restaurants was considered rude. 

A few weeks ago, to practice assertive communication, in the same tone as ""can you pass the butter"" at a dinner table, I asked a woman playing her music on speaker in the gym locker room, ""hey, you mind turning that off?"" 

She got defensive and flustered. When I told someone about it they said I sound entitled and like a Karen and that I can't control other people. But my other friend told me he was impressed I stayed even keeled and asked. We both agreed that making a request is not control.

So then today when a guy had TV on speaker in a coffee shop I didn't know what to do. I asked the people at the coffee shop if they have a policy around speaker, they said no. I said I didn't want to ask him to turn it down because people get upset, but he is playing news and I don't want to listen to it while I work, I'm about to just play music on speaker to drown it out. They said they don't blame me. 

So then I played my music on speaker to drown out this guys news. Then the people at the coffee shop asked me to turn my music off once the guy turned his news off. Which I also find curious. Of course I would prefer to not have my music playing on speaker but since other people do it unchecked then I see no other option but to put up and shut up or to drown them out.

1ljoh8p,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1ljoh8p/10_moneymaking_ai_prompts_with_frameworks_that/,10 Money-Making AI Prompts (With Frameworks That Actually Work),"I've been obsessively testing and refining AI prompts that go beyond the usual “write me a blog post” stuff. These are serious prompts designed to create actual business assets; things like productized services, high-converting sales scripts, scalable workflows, and even mindset breakthroughs.

The real benefit comes from combining a clear role, a smart framework, and a strong objective. Every prompt here is built on a battle-tested mental model from business, psychology, or systems design and I’ve included the framework for each one so you can understand why it works and become better at prompting yourself .

These are the 10 best prompts I’ve used, all copy-paste ready. Save them, use them, and let me know what results you got.

**1. The ""Signature Service"" Design Framework: Chain of Thought + Productization**

**Framework Used:** **CoT (Chain of Thought) + Productization.** Chain of Thought prompts the AI to ""think step-by-step,"" breaking a complex problem into a logical sequence. Productization is the business concept of turning a service into a standardized, scalable product.

**Why it's powerful:** This prompt stops you from selling your time (e.g., ""blog post writing"") and starts you selling a high-value, productized system (e.g., ""The SEO Authority Engine""). This is the single fastest way to 5x your freelance income.

**Prompt:**

    Act as a high-ticket business consultant. My current service is [Generic Service, e.g., 'writing social media posts']. I want to transform this into a premium ""Signature Service"" that I can charge [Target Price, e.g., '$3,000/mo'] for.
    
    Think step-by-step to design this service:
    1.  Give it a compelling, branded name: (e.g., ""The Viral Content Engine"").
    2.  Define the specific, transformational outcome for the client:** What is their ""dream result""?
    3.  Break it down into 3-5 unique pillars or phases: (e.g., Pillar 1: Audience & Competitor Analysis, Pillar 2: High-Impact Content Creation, Pillar 3: Multi-Platform Distribution & Engagement).
    4.  List the specific, tangible deliverables for each pillar.
    5.  Suggest a unique process or proprietary method** that makes my service different from what anyone else offers.

**2. The Niche Authority Affiliate Review Article Framework: CO-STAR**

**Framework Used:** **CO-STAR (Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response).** This framework provides the AI with a comprehensive creative brief, ensuring all aspects of the output are perfectly aligned with the strategic goal.

**Why it's powerful:** This creates a perfectly structured, SEO-optimized ""money post"" that's designed to build trust and convert readers. It forces the AI to focus on user benefits, not just product features, which is the key to high conversion rates.

**Prompt:**

    Act as a world-class SEO copywriter and expert in the [Your Niche, e.g., 'home coffee brewing'] niche.
     
    Context: You are writing for a blog that helps beginners make informed buying decisions.
    
    Objective: To persuade the reader to purchase the [Product Name, e.g., 'Breville Barista Express'] through an affiliate link by providing immense value.
    
    Style: Expert, yet approachable and engaging.
    
    Tone: Honest and trustworthy, not overly ""salesy.""
    
    Audience: Beginners in the niche who are considering a significant purchase.
    
    Response Structure:
    1.  Catchy, SEO-Optimized Title: Include ""Review,"" ""Is It Worth It,"" and the current year.
    2.  Introduction: Hook the reader by addressing their core problem/desire and state the final verdict upfront.
    3.  Core Features Deep Dive: Explain the 5 most important features and, crucially, the benefit of each feature for the user.
    4.  Pros and Cons Table: A scannable, honest breakdown.
    5.  ""Who is this product FOR?"" (And who it's NOT for).
    6.  Comparison: Briefly compare it to one major competitor.
    7.  Conclusion & Final Recommendation: A strong call-to-action (CTA).



**3. The ""Value Ladder"" Architect Framework: Strategic Business Modeling**

**Framework Used:** **Strategic Business Modeling.** Based on a classic marketing concept popularized by Russell Brunson, this prompt guides the AI to map a customer's entire journey, from low-cost entry to high-ticket purchase.

**Why it's powerful:** A single product is not a business. This prompt helps you design a complete product ecosystem that maximizes customer lifetime value and builds a sustainable, scalable business.

Prompt:

    Act as a business model strategist. 
    
    My expertise is in [Your Skill, e.g., 'Notion productivity']. 
    Design a ""Value Ladder"" for my business. 
    
    Map out a 4-step ladder that guides a customer on their journey with me: 
    - Lead Magnet (Free) 
    - Tripwire Offer ($7–$47) 
    - Core Offer ($197–$497) 
    - High-Ticket Offer ($1,500+)



**4. The AI-Powered Productized Service Blueprint Framework: SOP Design + Systems Thinking**

**Framework Used:** **SOP (Standard Operating Procedure) Design + Systems Thinking.** This prompt tasks the AI with creating a detailed, step-by-step workflow, treating a business process like an assembly line where AI tools are the automated machinery.

**Why it's powerful:** This designs a scalable service where AI does 80% of the work. This allows you to offer a high-value service at a competitive price while maintaining massive profit margins. It's the blueprint for a modern, AI-leveraged business.

Prompt:

    I want to sell a productized service called ""[Service Name, e.g., 'Podcast Repurposer Pro']"" for [Price, e.g., '$299/episode']. The service turns one podcast episode into multiple content assets.
    
    Design the complete AI-assisted workflow for this service:
    1.  Client Input: What does the client provide? (e.g., an mp3 file).
    2.  The AI Workflow (Step-by-Step):
           Step 1: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Whisper AI'] for transcription.
           Step 2: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Claude 3'] with a specific prompt to extract 5 key takeaways and a summary.
           Step 3: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'ChatGPT-4'] with a prompt to write 3 Twitter threads based on the takeaways.
           Step 4: Use [AI Tool, e.g., 'Canva AI'] to create 5 quote cards.
    3.  Human Review: Where is the crucial human touchpoint for quality control and strategic polish before delivery?



**5. The ""Blue Ocean"" Strategy Canvas Framework: Blue Ocean Strategy**

**Framework Used:** **Blue Ocean Strategy (from W. Chan Kim & Renée Mauborgne).** This is a world-renowned business strategy framework for creating new market space (""Blue Oceans"") and making competition irrelevant.

**Why it's powerful:** Instead of trying to outperform rivals in a bloody ""red ocean,"" this prompt uses a famous framework to help you invent a new market. It's for creating a business that has no direct competition.

**Prompt**

    Act as a business strategist trained in Blue Ocean Strategy. I am in the crowded [Your Industry, e.g., 'project management software'] industry.
    
    Help me find a new market space using the ""Four Actions Framework"":
    1.  List Key Factors: What are the 6-8 factors that companies in my industry currently compete on?
    2.  Eliminate: Which of these factors that the industry takes for granted can we completely eliminate?
    3.  Reduce: Which can be reduced well below the industry standard?
    4.  Raise: Which can be raised well above the industry standard?
    5.  Create: What new factors can we introduce that the industry has never offered?
    
    Based on your answers, propose a new, innovative product concept for a currently underserved customer.

  
**6. The VSL (Video Sales Letter) Script Generator**

**Framework Used:** **Direct-Response Copywriting Structure.** This prompt follows a classic, psychologically-driven sales script formula proven to hold attention and drive conversions in video format.

**Why it's powerful:** VSLs are one of the highest-converting sales assets online. This prompt provides a proven script structure that takes a viewer from casual interest to a strong desire to buy. It's a money-printing machine if done right.

**The Prompt:**

    Act as a direct-response video scriptwriter. Write a complete 10-minute VSL script to sell my [Product/Course, e.g., 'Side Hustle Launchpad' course]. The video will be voiceover on top of simple text slides.  
    
    Follow this structure precisely: 
    1.  The Hook (0-30s): A bold, pattern-interrupting question or statement. 
    2.  Problem & Agitation (30s-2m): Detail the audience's pain. 
    3.  Introduce the ""New Opportunity"" (2m-3m): Hint at the solution without revealing the product. 
    4.  Backstory & Discovery (3m-5m): Your story of finding this solution. 
    5.  The Solution Reveal (5m-7m): Introduce your product by name. 
    6.  The Offer Stack (7m-9m): List every deliverable, bonus, and guarantee to build overwhelming value. 
    7.  The Urgent CTA (9m-10m): A clear call to action with scarcity or urgency.



# 7. The ""Voice of Customer"" Data Miner

**Framework Used:** **APE (Action, Purpose, Expectation).** This direct prompting framework is ideal for specific data analysis tasks. We are telling the AI exactly what to do, why it's doing it, and what the final output should look like.

**Why it's powerful:** The best marketing copy uses the customer's exact words. This prompt turns the AI into a research analyst that can sift through reviews or comments to pull out the exact pain points and ""golden phrases"" you should be using in your ads and sales pages.

**The Prompt:**

    Action: Analyze the following set of [source, e.g., 'Amazon reviews for a competing product']. 
    Purpose: To extract the ""Voice of Customer."" I want their exact pain points, desires, and language to use in my marketing. 
    Expectation: 
    1.  List the top 5 recurring Pain Points mentioned. 
    2.  List the top 5 Desired Outcomes they talk about. 
    3.  Extract 10-15 ""golden phrases"" – direct, emotionally charged quotes. 
    4.  Summarize the overall customer sentiment in one paragraph.  
    
    [Paste your raw data here.]



# 8. The ""Economic Moat"" Audit

**Framework Used:** **Value Investing Principles (from Warren Buffett/Charlie Munger).** This prompt applies the mental models of the world's best investors to your own business, forcing a focus on long-term defensibility.

**Why it's powerful:** A profitable business is good; a defensible business is valuable. This prompt forces you to analyze how protected your business is from competition. A strong moat is what allows for long-term, sustainable profits.

**The Prompt:**

    Role: A value investor and business analyst. 
    
    Task: Audit my business, [Business Description], to assess the strength of its economic moat.  Analyze my business against the four primary types of economic moats. Provide a score of 1-5 for each and a suggestion for how to widen that moat. 
    1.  Intangible Assets: (Brand, IP) 
    2.  Switching Costs: (How hard is it for customers to leave?) 
    3.  Network Effects: (Does the service get better with more users?) 
    4.  Cost Advantages: (Can I operate cheaper than rivals?)  
    
    Provide an overall summary of my business's long-term defensibility.



# 9. The High-Converting Freelance Service Page Copy

**Framework Used:** CoT (Chain of Thought) + Problem-Agitate-Solve (PAS) Copywriting. The prompt's step-by-step nature guides the AI through a logical flow, mirroring the classic PAS formula to create persuasive, client-centric copy.

**Why it's powerful:** Most freelancers list their skills. This prompt forces the AI to write a page that focuses entirely on the client's pain and desired outcome, which is infinitely more persuasive. It's designed to generate leads, not just inform.

**The Prompt:**

    Act as a direct-response copywriter. Write the copy for the service page of a [Your Service, e.g., 'Webflow Developer']. 
    
    The audience is non-technical small business owners who are overwhelmed and need a website that gets them clients.  
    
    Think step-by-step: 
    1.  Start with a headline that speaks directly to their pain point (e.g., ""Your Website Should Make You Money, Not Headaches.""). 
    2.  Write an opening paragraph that shows empathy for their struggle. 
    3.  Create a ""Here's How We Fix It"" section with 3 simple, benefit-focused steps. 
    4.  Write a section titled ""This Is For You If..."" to qualify the right clients. 
    5.  Include a clear Call to Action (e.g., ""Book a Free 15-Minute Strategy Call"").  
    
    Tone: Confident, clear, and benefit-oriented. Avoid technical jargon.



# 10. The Core Belief Autopsy

**Framework Used:** **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) - The ""Downward Arrow"" Technique.** A therapeutic technique designed to trace a surface-level emotional reaction down to the foundational, often unconscious belief that's driving it.

**Why it's powerful:** The biggest bottleneck in any solo business is the founder's own psychology. This prompt helps you uncover the deep, limiting beliefs (e.g., ""I'm a fraud"") that lead to procrastination and fear of selling. Solving this is more valuable than any marketing tactic.

**The Prompt:**

    Act as a cognitive archaeologist. 
    I want to investigate a recent negative emotional reaction related to my business.  
    
    The Situation: [e.g., ""I needed to send a proposal to a big potential client, and I felt completely frozen with anxiety.""]  
    
    The Investigation (The ""Downward Arrow""): 
    1. What was the specific emotion? 
    2. What was the ""hot thought"" in that moment? (e.g., ""They're going to think my prices are too high."") 
    3. If that thought were true, what would it mean about me? (""It means I'm not worth it."") 
    4. And if that were true... what does it mean? (""It means I'm a fraud."")  
    
    Keep going until you hit a foundational belief about yourself. Stare it in the face. This is what you're really fighting.

A few weeks ago I asked the above question in the picture and it got a lot of interest. I think because it is actually a really difficult issue. How do we cater a space to meet remote workers needs while still maintaining the the positive atmosphere that everyone finds so important in Coffee shops. Furthermore, how do we balance wanting a vibrant shop with people in it with those customers who buy a drink and take up space at a table all day working. After a lot of thinking and conversations with all types of coffee shop owners (those who absolutely hate remote workers and want nothing to do with them, and those who have built multiple meeting rooms into their shop to better cater to them), I think I have found an interesting solution to the problem that costs nothing to a shop.  

If you own a coffee shop and want people to be able to remote work in your shop, but would like a better way to monetize them / continue to provide that third space feel without the annoying zoom meetings and ambiance killers that some remote workers bring, please reach out.

I'm really looking for others just to say what is normal.  I tend to not have any issues going to the toilet, occasionally loose but overall regular.

I do get bloating, feeling nausea and lately bouts of bad stomach cramps.  Often very low just above the hip/groin on the left and can sometimes extend to the other side.  Might last a few days or few weeks then goes but comes back.

I'm having a hard time trying to pin point what is setting it off.  Like how long after you eat something does it take for you to feel the effects?  

It doesn't matter if I go to the toilet, the pain is still there, eating plain and stuff on the good side of the fodmap doesn't help much either.  I've heard stress can bring it on and hot weather too?

I'm just looking for things that have helped you, if you get similar symptoms to me, how long they last and things you wish you knew sooner.

1ljobiz,https://www.reddit.com/r/JetSetNest/comments/1ljobiz/susurros_del_corazón_review/,Susurros del Corazón  Review,"I visited the resort in June and overall had a great time. I can see the appeal of this place; its compact but well laid out, never feels crowded, and is very well run. A beautiful property worth a visit.

**Overall Impression**  
Susurros is a polished, design-forward beachfront resort in Punta de Mita that manages to feel both elevated and unfussy, and is ideal for travelers who want something more intimate and design-forward than Four Seasons or Rosewood, but still polished and family-friendly. It’s less buttoned-up than FS, less traditional than Rosewood, and more beachfront-social than the ultra-secluded jungle vibe at One&Only Mandarina. Guests tend to be well-traveled, style-conscious, and looking for thoughtful luxury with a real sense of place. It strikes a nice balance: luxe enough to attract a few low-key celebrities (we saw several, no one cared), but still relaxed and warm. It's part of the Auberge Resorts Collection, and while it's clearly built for high-end clientele, there's a grounded, contemporary Mexican identity running through everything, from the architecture to the handmade soap in the rooms.

**Accommodations**  
The resort has 59 hotel-style rooms (studios, casitas, and suites), plus 30 residences for larger groups. About a dozen units have private plunge pools. The aesthetic is minimal but clearly with a sense of place, with lots of stone, clay, woven textures, and soft white and beige color palettes that let the views do the work. Our room was stocked with locally made robes, bug spray, bath products, and a few thoughtful extras. “Cuates” (your designated butler, though the word means “friend” in Spanish) handle everything from dinner reservations to last-minute needs and although I am not sold on this concept of a personal butler since it's mainly just texting someone, mine tracked down a USB charger when I forgot mine.

**Food**  
There are two main restaurants: La Boquita (casual tacos, beachfront) and Casamilpa (upscale Mexican-Euro fusion). Both were solid across multiple meals. During high season, there’s a pop-up concept that rotates in sushi, seafood, or picnic-style offerings. We also did a guac and ceviche class with the culinary team which was fun, hands-on, and led by chefs who were charming and engaging.

**Service**  
Service is dialed in. There’s been a clear lift under new GM Christian González, who came over from Rosewood Mayakoba and has a long Four Seasons pedigree. The culture feels intentional and well-led.

**Family**  
Great option for families. The beach is swimmable for confident swimmers and the surf works well for beginners and intermediates. Friends raved about the kids club and had a great experience with the babysitters. IMO it’s incredibly welcoming for families and well set up to support them.

**Wellness / Spa / Pools**  
Onda Spa has 12 treatment cabins and a couples suite. You don’t need a treatment to access the facilities, but the massage I had was genuinely excellent. Three pools total, including an adults-only pool (Acapulco) with five cabanas and a peaceful vibe.

My avorite activity was the cacao ceremony. It might sound a little woo-woo, but the guide was grounded and insightful. The Nahual readings (think spirit animals) felt meaningful and personal. We also did a hat-making class with Mowi and brought home something far cooler than another branded tote.

**Drawbacks**  
You’ll need a car or resort transport to get anywhere—there’s nothing walkable from the property. If you like to wander off for a coffee or quick bite, this isn’t that kind of setup.

**Final Takeaways**  
Susurros delivers a thoughtful, locally rooted version of luxury in a truly beautiful setting. Between the warm, dialed-in service, well-executed design, and range of unique activities, there’s a lot to like. It’s a strong choice for families, groups, or couples looking for a more soulful take on the high-end beach resort experience.

The drink no longer tasted angry. It was simply pure caffeinated bliss sliding smoothly across my tongue. Consequently, this made it much easier to chug the whole can in seconds flat (which may be what the manufacturers wanted to prevent in the first place).

1ljo3oi,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tonsillectomy/comments/1ljo3oi/my_tonsillectomy_experience_so_far/,My tonsillectomy experience so far...,"Hi everyone! I had my tonsillectomy on the 17th June, I'm a week on from my surgery and I just wanted to pop on here and hopefully give some reassurance for anyone having the surgery soon. 

Before I had the surgery, I googled everything about tonsillectomies, I read all the horror stories and completely freaked myself out. To the point I was very close to cancelling the procedure and debated just dealing with strep. But I am SO pleased I went through with it. 

My surgery went absolutely fine, I'd never been put to sleep before. It wasn't as scary as I thought and I had no reaction to GA. Straight after the surgery and then from days 1-4, my throat genuinely just felt like a really bad case of tonsillitis. Except if anything it wasn't as bad as I didn't have any body aches, shivers or a fever. So for me, this was actually a more tame feeling. My throat felt swollen and sore but the more I spoke, ate and drank the less it hurt. I kept topped up on ibuprofen and paracetamol and made sure I kept up with my fluids. I bought those ice pack wraps to help with the swelling which was great. The rough days for me were days 5 & 6, this was purely down to the earache. Oh my gosh, the pain from the earache was like nothing I've experienced before. The ice pack wraps could also be heated, so I started using them as heat packs to ease the earache and that really helped! I put the earache down to the fact the scabbing started coming away from day 5 which then left increased sensitivity. 

I'm now on day 7 and today has been my best day yet. Earache has gone down loads, I only get pain when I eat and then 10 minutes after I've eaten, the pain subsides and I'm fine again. Now my throat just feels like a minor tonsillitis episode and the scabbing as gone down drastically. Finally light at the end of the tunnel. I just wanted to share this so whoever has a tonsillectomy upcoming and may be as scared as I was, just know, not all experiences are negative. 

So my overall advice of things to do/use during your recovery would be... 

Eat - As normal as you can. My surgeon told me this helps your throat heal and reduces the chances of an infection. Even if it's soft mushy foods or just soup/broths. Anything is better than nothing. Stock up on ice lollies for the first few days, you can have ice cream but it's dependent on how swollen your throat is. I was advised to avoid dairy products for the first few days due to them being all gacky at the back of your throat. The nurse told me protein and vitamin C are great to have as it helps with healing. You can get dissolvable vitamin C tablets and I ate things like mashed eggs for protein. 

Fluids - Drink drink drink. Keep water by your bedside table at night, you will wake up with you throat feeling like it's got razor blades sticking into it. Keeping your fluids up will really help. It also helps to keep the scabbing wet which helps when they are due to start coming away. Luke warm drinks like tea or coffee felt AMAZING on my throat from days 5 onwards and were my go to. 

Pain management - I took ibuprofen every 4 hours and dissolved my paracetamol in my water which actually helped to sort of numb my throat as it passed through already dissolved. It helped with more instant relief, which is what the nurse advised me to do. So thankful she gave me that advice. I didn't take the harder stuff due to the fact I have a high pain threshold but if you need to, take it. You don't get a medal for soldiering through it, gotta do what you gotta do to get through! Ice pack head wraps off amazon were great. The ones you can freeze and heat up so you can use it for the swelling and also potential earache. 

Childcare - If you have kids, I really do reccomend organising someone or multiple people to help out if you can. I had my mum, husband and in-laws helping me this first week and I'm so relieved I did. I've got help the next 2 days and after that I think I'll be fine by myself. But it will allow you to really focus on resting, which also speeds up your recovery. Take it as easy as you can, so important to rest!! 

Good luck to everyone currently recovering and due for surgery soon.  We've all got this 👍 ",3,1750801800.0,Tonsillectomy,1,1.0,False

My life is falling apart and im going insane. 



Starting from even earlier:

Chapter 1 - (June 2018)

It's summer of 2018. Im about 19 finishing my high school. 18th birthday is huge thing in my country - you can vote, drink alcohol etc. I went to my friends 18th birthday, long way from my home but i liked him very much. I was with my GF (18F at the time - broke up nearly year after this night, not connected). I met a lot of new people. One of ppl i met was her. When I first saw her i was flabbergasted. She was absolutely stunning, most beautiful person i ever saw - Ill call her Alex. My GF must have seen that in my eyes, and instantly got angry on me and told me that if i'll even try to talk to her during this party she will imidietly break up with me. So i didn't try. I got myself a grip and was just vibing whole night with ppl. Maybe when i was drunk we exchanged a few sentences, not even in 1 on 1 situation - nothing special or worth remembering.

That's the end of first interaction.

Chapter 2 - (June 2020 - July 2020)

Im 22 and its summer. Ive just got my second (of three) year of college done. I'm heartbroken at the time, because girl broke up with me (not the same girl as before and not connected to the story). I start using dating app - tinder. I see Alexs profile and i immediately give her ""like"". She liked back, we talked few times and decided to meet. She had exactly identical sense of humor as me. It was like heaven, i could just talk to her for hours and laugh to my screen whole time. I still remember my cheeks aching because of amount of time smiling to the phone screen. We had so much in common...Since then we spent like every day meeting/texting.   
One day we were drinking beer on public beach and she started teasing me that i'd be too scared to kiss her. Ofc i was, but i just finished beer and told her to close her eyes. It was heaven. It's so vivid in my head even now 5 years later. 

Since then everything changed. We were not only great friends as before - we touched, hugged and kissed, we did every possible thing together. After few weeks I lured my family off the house and invited her. We ""watched"" a movie, but i think it was maybe five minutes before we were in my bed with our first time (not first for me or her, just first together). 

Weeks went by, and everything started to collapse. I wasn't perfect, I was immature as hell, but I cant tell what i did wrong. At that moment i remember - I felt like everything i did i did wrong. I was so lost, everything i said she was taking as attack. Every little joke when i tried to make her laugh. Every text about our intimacy resulted in anger from Alex. Everytime it was so quick - one second we're fine, both laughing about most absurd things, and in next minute she tells me im awful person, and what is the reason i hate her. Im clueless. Some days are perfect i love her, i tell her so, and she says she loves me back, and some days are horror. Once when i ask her whats going on, she tells me that the problem is that she doesnt know ""what are we"" and she feels like a hoe bcs of doing such things with someone who is not her boyfrined. 

DUH PROBLEM SOLVED - LETS BE TOGETHER. And now we have another problem. Alex doesnt want to be with me. She offers fwb, but after few days (even without any benefits), she takes this idea down too. 

We're in the late July. Every day means new argue about everything. I love her, but i cant do it anymore. I cut her out.

  
Chapter 3 - (August 2024 - January 2025)

Since 2020 I had her instagram and i muted it. I was in relationship for 3 years with another girl and it was great time (since september 2021). Now its end of summer 2024, my relationship is going toward the end. We had great time, but it just falls apart slowly, we re together mostly bcs of being used to ourselves. 

One random summer day i got text from Alex. So much has changed, she tells me she is a different person but she is heart broken now. She were in 3 year relationship too till July of 2024. Now she wants to have a new start with me as friends. We talk a lot. Im slowly ending my relationship, and im slowly falling for Alex again. I feel awful about myself bcs of it, bcs i hate disloyalty. I met Alex once, nothing happend it was just nice and fun time with a lot o talking and drinking coffee. We break up with my GF before christmas. Alex has a lot of problems in life. She is still heartbroken about her last BF, and has a lot of shit in home, and cant find new job. I propose her that we can meet on Christmas Eve if she doesnt want to be in home that day (she said that and that day is hugely celebrated with family in my country). Firstly she agrees, then takes it back the next day and ghosts me for a week. 

Im broken. It was too much for me in few weeks. I cut out everyone and spent whole xmass alone. 

In January i slowly start going back to people. I met with my long time female friend (also 26F as Alex, 25 a that time), we get totally shitface drunk. She knew most of this story, and now i told her everything). She takes my phone and block Alex everywhere. Facebook, Instagram, Tiktok. Only thing left is her phone number, but we both agree that you shouldnt ever block anyone (especially with such suicidal and self hatred tendencies) on every medium. Just in case. 

  
Chapter 4 - (June 2025)

Im 27. I feel im getting old already. My work life settles, i live alone in my own apartment that i dont even need to rent, my finances are good. Im working on my love life. I want to love someone and feel loved once again. In February of 2025 i started using dating apps again. Tinder and Bumble. I once saw Alex on tinder about March 2025. Gave her like for a reasons...Got pair but instantly blocked her. 

Got text from her in May - one emoticon, her typical emoticon that i know wasnt accident and few seconds later ""sorry missclick"". I just ignored it.

Its now June - 5 days ago. I see her profile on Bumble. I swipe right (its stronger than me). She texts me immediately. Something like ""I have so much to tell you, so much changed in my life. Im happy now. I went to psychiatrist."" She tells me that takes meds now, and she is so much better person than she was. And she would love to try once more to make some kind of relationship with me (not specified what kind). We talked few days. It was like old times. Im falling again. I feel that im already doomed again.  
We meet, she comes to my place. We talk, she tells me about man that she met on dating apps, i tell her about girls i met. We talk about everything. Then she randomly tells me to kiss her. My head explodes but i do it. I was dreaming about this moment for 5 years so ofc i do. We are lying on the flor in my kitchen and kiss for like and hour or two. Passionate like two people in love who didnt see each other for years.

Chapter 5 - Summary

It was sunday. When we text next day i try to find any clues what she would like from me. Shortcut:  
1. She doesn't want fwb (""we're already over this phase"")

2. She doesn't want romantic relationship (""im sorry i cant give you that"")

3. As i belive basic friends dont do things such as pointed in last paragraph.

  
Im broken, im clueless and i feel like im blind. I feel like im missing something.

Why do i still love her? Because she is most pure and most beautiful girl in the world. Id give her everything and do everything for her to be happy. But i dont know how. How do i can make her happy without going more insane? 

  
We see each other tommorow. My current intention is to spent time with her last time. Tell her exactly what i feel and how much pain i have in me because of this situation and then disappear from her life once again. Hopefully last time. I think if ill go for this once again there wont be any more healing after this. No more time for myself to think. Ill just go batshit insane and dont know how it will ends for me. 

  
Im sorry for any language issues. Im trying my best as not native speaker.

That’s not an exaggeration. The nightmares won’t let me. Every time I close my eyes, I’m back there—in the woods, walking barefoot in pitch-black silence, a kitchen knife gripped tight in my hand, and a heartbeat in my ears that I’m not sure is mine.

I wake up drenched in sweat, shaking, sometimes with dirt under my fingernails or small cuts on my feet. And lately… I’ve been waking up in places I didn’t fall asleep.

My name is Carson. I’m a homicide detective in a city that doesn’t sleep much anymore. Because for the last three months, there’s been a serial killer on the loose.

We call him The Watchman.

⸻

The first body was found in an alley—early thirties, multiple stab wounds. Posed deliberately. No signs of struggle. Almost like she accepted it.

No fingerprints. No DNA. Nothing left behind… except for a silver pocket watch. Old-fashioned. Number 1 etched into the underside.

Nine days later, another body.

Same M.O.
Same watch.
Engraved with a 2.

We were hunting someone organized. Ritualistic. Cold. The city panicked, the mayor made speeches, and I was given full control of a task force.

But the deeper I went, the more the case started bleeding into my life in ways I couldn’t explain.

⸻

The third victim had something carved beneath her ribs. A symbol. It looked meaningless to my team, but I recognized it immediately.

I’d drawn it before.

On napkins. In notebooks. On the margins of coffee receipts. Always in a half-awake state, like my hand was doing its own thing.

I chalked it up to stress. But I stopped sleeping after that.

And then last week, I woke up outside. No shoes. My shirt soaked in dew. There were cuts on my feet and arms—fresh. Like I’d been walking through thorns. And worst of all?

Dirt under my fingernails.

Not just dirt.

Blood-stained dirt.

⸻

I raced to the precinct. Checked the system. Sure enough—there’d been a new body found less than two hours before I woke up. Same scene. Same signature.

Victim number seven.

But I hadn’t seen it on the news. No one had told me. And yet… I knew exactly where she’d been left.

Because I’d dreamed it the night before.

I could describe the tree roots. The exact slope of the hill. Even the smell.

That’s when something shifted in me. I didn’t know if I was losing my mind or… if it was something worse.

⸻

This morning, I checked the evidence locker. I had to see it all for myself. The watches, lined up neatly.

But there was a new one.

An eighth watch.

Victim seven had just been found. No eighth victim had been reported. And yet… there it was.

Pristine. Ticking quietly. No evidence label. No officer logged it in.

I turned it over.

One set of initials carved deep into the back.

C.V.

My own.

⸻

I drove home in silence, heart thundering the entire time. I locked every door. Took sleeping pills. I didn’t want to know what happened next. I just wanted out of the spiral.

But I woke up outside again.

Covered in mud.

Something whispered my name in the dark.

I spun around. No one there.

Just a small, glinting object on my doorstep—carefully placed.

The ninth watch.

Hey, Reddit. Me again. 

[Here's my first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/s/mYeyOIsXIL)

[here's the first update](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/s/KD8Bqr4v5k)

[and here's the second update](https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/s/9XlVlWgvBx)

Everything got weirder since my last update. Now I’m here in Sofia’s car, in the middle of the night. It’s still raining outside. And I think I still hear her calling. Humming. 

The humming. It was still there when Sophia’s phone died. It was still there, just a little beyond the sound of the rain, like it was hiding. Like a mournful melody exhumed from the soaked earth. I tried to sleep, but again that itchy feeling all over my body. Not just…well, in my gentleman parts. Now it was all over me.  Or better… underneath me.
 
I was there, trying to figure out what to do —should I look for her?, should I call the police?, her parents? —, while doing  my best to convince me, like all those prior days, that it was all on my mind. That it was nothing but a misunderstanding. That she surely would be there by my side tomorrow, like anything happened. I knew Sofia wasn’t here anymore. But still, some part of me was trying to convince me that none of this was real. That there were a reasonable explanation for all of this.

 I couldn’t help feeling guilty for the first time. And I cried. It was hard, and I sobbed like a little child, but for the first time in these days I finally got to see clear. It was hurtful, but  the pain made me realize. 

This wasn’t mine.
 
This wasn’t grief. 

It was her. 

 La Vieja que Susurra. 

That sudden realization came with a little sense of relief, and a lot of tiredness. I must have felt asleep, hearing the rain hammering against  my window. And then I smelled it. Hot cakes. The smell came with the realization that now everything was quiet outside. The heavy silence contrasted with the pouring rain I’d swear I was hearing just a moment before. That sensation only contributed to the feeling that there was something artificial in that silence. It felt overwhelming. Unbearable. Even my breathing sounded too loud. 

My stomach lurched, but not from hunger. The smell of the hot cakes was sweet, doughy, comforting. But it was mixed with that other smell. The one from the backyard figures. Herbal, smoked, fiercely old. My gut screamed at me.

Hotcakes at 3 AM? 

After all this? 

I wanted to call her name.

But I was afraid of what would answer.

I crept out of bed, suddenly dazzled by how loud my barefoot footsteps sounded. No, not sounded. Felt.

I glanced at the window.
The rain was still falling—fast, hard—
But silent.
Utterly, impossibly silent. 

I moved forward, fearful, to the origin of the smell. 

The kitchen glowed with a dim, yellowish light from the stove. And there she was. Sofía. Standing at the counter, her back to me, stirring something in a bowl. She was wearing one of my old oversized shirts, too big for her, covered in what looked like… mud streaks. Fresh, dark mud. ""No, it couldn't be her"", I thought. My heart hammered against my ribs, but a part of me, a desperate, broken part, just wanted her to be real. As I got closer, I could see her bare feet on the tiled floor, black with mud, almost caked in it.

“Sofía?” I whispered, my voice thick with fear. It sounded like it was coming from the other side of the world. 

She stiffened, then slowly turned. Her face was pale, almost translucent in the dim light. And her smile. It was wide. Too wide. It stretched her lips thin, pulling them back from her teeth. But it wasn't just stretched—her mouth, her chin, her cheeks, even her teeth were smeared with dark, wet mud, as if she’d been eating it. Her eyes were dark, almost black, and empty. Like two polished stones. But they were looking at me. And in those eyes, I could see the reflection of the flickering stove light, dancing in the void. And her feet… beneath the thick mud, they didn’t look quite right. They seemed… shapeless, almost too fluid, as if the mud wasn't just on them, but was holding them together, barely containing something formless beneath.

“Hey, sleepyhead. You awake? “. It was the way she greeted me every morning for the 4 years we were living together. It was so familiar, yet her voice Was… wrong. It was hers. But also deep, not in like a man’s way. I mean deep, like too resonant.

“Wh- What is this?, what are you doing?”.  I asked, shakingly. My mind repeating that this was a dream. Nothing but a dream. 

“Pancakes”. She answered with a giggle. Like if the weirdo was me for asking. 

“At 3 Am? Babe, what is this? “. I wanted to believe her. I wanted to believe that everything would be over by tomorrow. That we would be drinking coffee the next morning like nothing ever happened.
 
“Just hungry,” she said, and stirred. Humming. The same song. 

That’s when I saw it clearly. The bowl was full of hotcake batter, but she was just… dumping whole eggs into it. Shells and all. They cracked and splintered, bits of white and yolk mixing with the shards. And the pan on the stove… it was slick with a thick, yellowish liquid. Not butter. Not milk. Just… pure vegetable oil, smoking slightly, giving off a greasy, acrid smell that mingled horribly with the sweet batter and that ancient herbal scent. “How’s your groin? Still itching down there? Maybe I could bring some herbs to make it better”, she said with an even wider smile. ""The rain always keeps its secrets. But not for me, anymore"". And then the humming. Louder. 

“Sofia, please. We got to go”. My voice barely a whisper. 

She looked at me, her head cocked at an unnatural angle. The humming from her voice grew even louder, filling the kitchen, vibrating through the floorboards. The herbal smell was choking me. And her eyes... they weren't just dark anymore. There was something behind them. Something ancient and hungry. Something that knew me.

She held out a plate. On it, a hotcake. Misshapen, raw in the middle, bits of eggshell glinting. And it was covered in… mud. Not syrup. Thick, dark, wet mud.

“Eat”. She hummed. “Reconnect. Join us. The soil remembers, and she hungers.” 

My mind screamed. This wasn’t Sofía. This wasn’t my wife. This was her. This was La Vieja. And she wanted me. The mournful cry I’d heard in the static, the hum from the jungle, it was all coming from her now.

Her head tilted, almost sadly. “She chose,” the hum vibrated, filling the space between us. “She answered the call. She didn't ignore the song of the rain. Her roots run deep here. Yours… are still buried in asphalt.” And then her smile stretched again, wider, smeared with mud. “Go. Choose to remain outside. For now.” And this time it really was her voice. Sofía’s. 

“Sofia. Love. We need to go”. I said, but deep inside I knew it was no use. And my body understood it better than my mind, because it just started to back up. The humming filled my ears, no longer just a sound, but a crushing pressure. The kitchen felt like it was shrinking, the walls pressing in. And through the wide, unnatural smile on Sofía’s face, I swore I could hear the faint, mournful cry of a woman, carried on the relentless rain outside, pulling me into the darkness. I could feel her breath, cold and damp, on my face, mixing with the hotcake smell.
I don’t know what happened next. I just ran. Out of the kitchen. Out of the house.  A minute later I was in her car. Driving. Not really sure where I was heading, I didn’t care where. Just far. 

I’m somewhere outside now, inside her car, shivering, hiding. I can still hear the humming. I don’t know if she’s coming for me. Or if Sofía is still in there. Or if Sofía ever was. 

I got a new message. From Sofía.

""Is everything OK? Where are you?"".

Sure, there's the monthly night market which I don't find to encourage socializing. Summer sounds is pretty much the same. I don't really find the vendor experience all that fun if you can tell.

I have been avoiding the Y for personal reasons, but I know they do adult pickup sports. That said, they have terrible times for those. They are almost entirely during most people's regular work hours. (While I'm thinking about it, what's with all the coffee shops closing on weekends and early on Saturdays?!)

I realize I am not the only one looking for connections. Any post that offers to help connect people is always popular, but genuinely, what are all you people doing? Just sitting inside isolated? Is there a secret underground culture I've missed? I ask those last questions jovially, of course.

1ljnqy1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sororities/comments/1ljnqy1/scared_for_formal_recruitment_after_my_cob/,Scared for formal recruitment after my COB experience,"Hey!

Last semester I did COB for a sorority because I had friends in it and I didn't have the time to go to the all the other sororities' events. I didn't mind if I didn't get a bid this time around, because I had a lot on my plate and I would just wait for formal recruitment (my school didn't do formal recruitment last semester). I liked the vibes for one of the ones I rushed, and they were very welcoming and sweet and I bonded a lot with the members. However, I didn't get an invite for their invitational. They said don't be scared to ask for a coffee date at their last event, so I did ask for one thinking I can still try and it went well. The very next day they rejected me, and I found out they accepted my friend who only went to one event (I'm very happy for her, but it stung). My friends were sad and didn't know why I was dropped either.

More recently, I heard from one of my friends in the chapter that their VP of Recruitment can be a lot to handle and can be difficult to work with. Apparently, there was even a big disagreement over a PNM she pushed for that no one else wanted—she got her way, but the girl ended up dropping days before pledging because she didn't really want to be there as she always made excuses to skip chapter events. I can vouch a bit on that, she was always on her phone at the COB events. When I saw the VP on campus a couple weeks after being dropped, I tried saying hi, and she just gave me a very awkward smile. This was unusual because the other members are still very nice to me and always gave me bright smiles. I still hangout with other members I met in that sorority, and they are sweet and very welcoming still. Also, I was the only PNM she unfollowed a bit after COB was done, as she follows other PNM who didn't get a bid from that sorority. I'm probably reading into that instance and it's not that deep.

I'm scared the VP of Recruitment doesn't like me and that'll impact my chances if she has that much power. I'm sad because I would love to be her friend but it seems like I blew it. I'm not really sure what I did to her either. My school doesn't have a lot of sororities, and I'm scared I won't get a bid for any of them. I guess all I can say is any advice for formal recruitment? COB was scary enough so I don't know what to expect for Formal. More so, I'm just scared to put myself out there now. Could I please have some advice? I wouldn't mind whatever sorority I was in.

I can’t even buy a couch for this house and I am so utterly depressed being surrounded by boxes of noodles that reach the ceiling. His mother who lives with us has completely taken over the kitchen. Any cups or plates I buy get broken by them and all of my utensils for cooking are put back filthy and unwashed or have gone completely missing.

It felt great at first, about a week in my bloating went down intensely and i had more energy. A couple months in and I would accidentally eat gluten and feel a little fatigued or weird but it was fine. Recently when Ive eaten gluten I felt extreme fatigue and lightheadedness. Now, I’m afraid that my stomach issues were never from gluten to begin with, and going gluten free only contributed to my declining health. No one really talks about how traumatizing and exhausting it is to have an unknown condition like I do. I can’t eat coffee, spicy foods, medicine, gluten or dairy without having waves of excruciating pain nausea and gas. I had a flare up of something and my body was shaking uncontrollably for hours. My mental never really recovered from it. Now when my stomach is upset i feel useless, i’m crying and begging for my body to be okay. I’ve never really thought about it too hard until today, I just bursted into tears after having another health scare with my appendix. I feel genuinely like i’m so scared for my health and that any day it could get worse and not be better for months again.  I’m just really lost, I don’t know what to do or why this happened to me when there’s no history of it in my family. It sounds so stupid to me to be crying over food but I really just want to feel okay again. Can anyone relate? 

Edit: I’d like to say that i’m not asking for medical advice, just sympathy and to feel less alone. I know what I have is probably an underlying issue and I’m taking responsibility to address it with a doctor, but my medical coverage sucks :( I’m not in chronic pain or a life threatening situation, just sad about the lifestyle change.

I’ve spent the past three months building my network at Firm X—so far, I’ve talked with senior associates, consultants, and a few managers in management consulting, M&A, IT consulting, advisory, and audit. Next week I’m meeting in person with a managing partner at the downtown office, and it’ll be my first partner-level conversation.

Quick Profile:

* Graduating this July, BBA/Finance student (Non Target Toronto) → Finance Consulting + deal-strategy interests
* \~10–12 virtual chats done; this is my first face-to-face 
* Goal: land full-time at Firm X, ideally in an advisory/consulting path

Looking for advice on:

1. How does etiquette shift when you’re speaking with someone this senior? Anything that felt normal with seniors/managers but you’d dial back—or double down on—with a partner?
2. Partner-tier questions that add value and aren’t the usual “what does your day look like?” (e.g., trends they’re betting on, how they evaluate junior talent, etc.).
3. The best way to signal genuine interest in joining the firm is without turning the chat into a hard sell.
4. Smart ways to reference my chats across M&A, IT consulting, and audit so it shows breadth, not confusion.
5. Follow-up cadence: How do you stay on a partner’s radar without being annoying?
6. Anything you wish you’d known before your first partner coffee chat?

Huge thanks for any input!

I'll visit my parents twice a year, for around 3 weeks at a time. The more time I spend here, the more I realize how high strung and mentally/physically ill I feel. 

They are hoarders, and don't really clean much in the house. Whenever I visit it smells like cat pee, and I had to clean out the whole coffee machine because the water had been sitting in there for days with dead bugs with it (and my mom was still drinking coffee from it daily)... I became sick after getting off the plane, but even then I felt like I needed to clean up as much as I can because I was sick to my stomach seeing the place. Dust and stains everywhere. The litter boxes only get cleaned like twice a week, but when I'm here i do it everyday or twice a day even. They currently have a terrible flea infestation, and I have bites on my ankles and feet and have resorted to wearing shoes and spraying deet on my ankles every 8 hours. I try to push them to get prescribed flea treatments for my 2 cats...but they dont care and just let them hang outside with the other strays in our backyard. The cats are constantly scratching and it makes me so sad :( my parents aren't poor by any means at all either. 

My parents argue with each other all the time. They've been married for awhile but stuck around ""for me"" or maybe they're both afraid of being alone. Either way I hear constant arguing or just extreme passive aggressive behaviors from both that just make the vibe extremely uncomfortable to be in.

\---

Hello everyone,

I hope this post is received in the spirit in which it is intended, which is one of profound and sincere seeking. My name isn't important, but perhaps my background is. I hold a master's degree in English, a field that has trained me to perform close readings of texts, to analyze arguments, to understand subtext, and to trace thematic threads through complex works. I am, by profession and by nature, a researcher. More importantly, I am a person of faith with a long and varied spiritual history. I was raised in the Catholic Church, where I learned to love God and appreciate the sacredness of tradition and liturgy. Later, as a young adult searching for a more rigorous, scripturally-based discipleship, I spent years as a dedicated member of the International Churches of Christ, where my life was saturated in daily Bible study and a zealous commitment to living the gospel as literally as possible.

My spiritual journey has been a long one, and it has recently led me to the missionaries from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. I need to state clearly and unequivocally that my experience with them, and with the scriptures they have shared, has been remarkable. They are wonderful, earnest people, and the kindness of the members I have met has been exemplary. Reading the Book of Mormon for the first time has been a revelation in itself. I have felt the distinct witness of the Holy Spirit confirming the truth of its pages in a way that is powerful and undeniable. I have come to believe that Joseph Smith was a true prophet who communed with God, and I hold a deep and growing respect for President Russell M. Nelson and the sacred office he holds as a living prophet, seer, and revelator.

Because of this powerful spiritual witness, and because of my background, I feel a deep responsibility to be a diligent and honest student of the gospel. My training does not allow me to simply skim the surface of things, and my past spiritual experiences have taught me the immense importance of ensuring that belief and practice are in perfect harmony. It was during a personal Bible study one evening that I was struck by a passage in Acts, chapter 17, verse 11. It describes the people of the city of Berea, and it says they were “more noble” than others because they “received the word with all readiness of mind, and **searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.**”

That verse resonated to the very core of my soul. It described exactly the kind of disciple I long to be: one who is open, ready, and eager to receive truth, but who also takes on the personal responsibility to rigorously test that truth against the word of God. It is a model of faith that is both spiritually receptive and intellectually honest. I decided to adopt this Berean method as my own personal standard as I continued my studies with the missionaries. This meant taking every principle they taught me back to the standard works, tracing it, testing it, and praying about it.

It is this process that has led me to a significant and deeply troubling stumbling block. While most of the doctrines I have studied weave together into a beautiful and harmonious tapestry, I have found a point of friction, a glaring disharmony, concerning the Church's current mandatory application of the Word of Wisdom and the covenant of wearing the temple garment. As I applied my Berean method to these specific policies, I found what appears to be a direct and sustained contradiction between the Church's current practice and its own foundational, revealed scripture. This post is the complete, exhaustive fruit of that long and prayerful study. I am not a critic looking for fault. I am a sincere seeker trying to resolve a conflict between what I am being taught by men and what I am reading in the holy scriptures. I am sharing my entire research process with you all, hoping that someone can illuminate my understanding, because I cannot move forward on my path toward this beautiful faith until I can reconcile this.

# Part 1: The Primary Text - A Forensic Examination of Doctrine & Covenants 89

My close reading of Doctrine & Covenants 89, treating it like a legal document, shocked me. Its plain meaning as a gentle, pastoral invitation directly opposes its modern, rigid application.

Verse 2, ""To be sent greeting; not by commandment or constraint,"" is an unambiguous disclaimer establishing its voluntary nature. This raises my fundamental question: If explicitly ""not by commandment or constraint,"" by what authority did it become a stringent, temple-recommend-enforced commandment? I find no subsequent revelation revoking this, making current policy seem to violate the original text.

Verse 3 calls it a ""principle with promise, adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest,"" suggesting a compassionate guide for beginners. This raises my second question: Why is a principle for the ""weakest"" now a primary worthiness test for our ""strongest"" temple covenants? This inversion seems illogical, akin to using a kindergarten exam for a doctorate. Temple tests should focus on ""weightier matters.""

The original text describes a loving, voluntary principle for new or struggling members, not a rigid, mandatory law for all. The immense disparity between this and current policy spurred my investigation.

# Part 2: The Exhaustive Scriptural Case - A Harmony of the Standard Works

My Berean journey could not end with a single section of scripture, no matter how clear it seemed. A true principle of God should harmonize with His word across all dispensations. Therefore, I expanded my search to all four standard works, looking for the grand, eternal themes that could provide context for Doctrine and Covenants 89. I wanted to see if the rest of God’s revealed word supported the current mandatory policy or if it supported the voluntary, grace-filled spirit of the original text. The result of this exhaustive study was an overwhelming, undeniable chorus of scripture, from Genesis to the final words of Moroni, that reinforces the latter. I have organized my findings by these major, recurring themes.

# Theme 1: The Spirit of the Law versus the Letter of the Law

Throughout the scriptures, God and His prophets have consistently taught that the condition of a person’s heart is infinitely more important than their outward observance of rules.

My first piece of evidence comes from the Savior’s own ministry, in His direct confrontation with the religious leaders of His day. In **Matthew 23, verse 23**, Jesus declares, ""Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone."" The Pharisees were masters of meticulous, checklist-based righteousness. They followed the letter of the law with a precision we would marvel at today. Yet Jesus condemns them in the strongest possible terms. His reasoning is that their focus on minor, external rules like tithing garden herbs caused them to completely neglect the core principles of the gospel like mercy and faith. He is teaching a clear hierarchy of importance. Applying this to our current situation, a strict, mandatory focus on a list of prohibited substances like coffee and tea feels dangerously similar to the Pharisees’ focus on mint and cumin. It elevates a secondary principle to a primary test of righteousness, risking the omission of those same ""weightier matters.""

Further evidence of Christ's focus on internal purity comes from **Mark chapter 7, verse 15**. Here, Jesus states a radical principle that would have shocked His audience. He says, ""There is nothing from without a man, that entering into him can defile him but the things which come out of him, those are they that defile the man."" He is explicitly teaching that spiritual purity is not a matter of diet or consumption. Spiritual defilement comes from within our own hearts. It is pride, greed, unkindness, and hate that make us unclean before God. This profound teaching reasons that our character, not our coffee cup, is what God truly judges. Therefore, a policy that makes an external substance a test of spiritual cleanliness seems to run contrary to the Savior’s own definition of what it means to be clean.

The Apostle Paul builds on this theme throughout his epistles. In **Romans chapter 14, verse 17**, he writes with beautiful simplicity, ""For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost."" Paul’s point is that we often get distracted by arguing over the fine points of what to eat or drink. He reasons that these are not the things that define our citizenship in God's kingdom. What defines us are the fruits of the Spirit, the internal qualities of righteousness and peace. The inescapable conclusion is that our focus should be on cultivating these inner virtues, not on policing external behaviors that Paul dismisses as secondary to our standing before God.

This theme is not limited to the Bible. It is a central message of the Book of Mormon as well. In **Alma chapter 5**, Alma the Younger asks a piercing series of questions to test the spiritual state of the church members. His ultimate test, found in **verse 14**, is this ""And now behold, I ask of you, my brethren of the church, have ye spiritually been born of God? Have ye received his image in your countenances? Have ye experienced this mighty change in your hearts?"" Alma’s measure of worthiness is this ""mighty change of heart."" He does not ask about their adherence to a code of health. He reasons that true conversion is a deep, internal transformation. This leads to the conclusion that the proper test for worthiness, for the temple or any other blessing, should be the state of one’s heart, not the contents of one’s diet.

# Theme 2: God's Foundational Law of Agency

The entire Plan of Salvation, as I have been taught it, hinges on the principle of moral agency, the freedom to choose. Satan’s plan was compulsion. God’s plan is persuasion and voluntary choice.

The Book of Mormon is perhaps the world’s most powerful testament to this principle. In **2 Nephi chapter 2, verse 27**, the prophet Lehi gives his final blessing to his sons. He teaches, ""Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh... And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil."" Lehi’s reasoning is that for a choice to have any eternal merit, it must be made freely. When we tie a specific lifestyle choice to the ability to receive saving ordinances or attend a child's wedding, we introduce a powerful element of institutional duress. This pressure can obscure a truly free choice, making it feel less like choosing liberty and more like complying to avoid a devastating social and familial punishment. A policy that creates such high stakes for non-compliance does not seem to align with Lehi’s vision of pure, unencumbered agency.

This is reinforced in the Pearl of Great Price. In **Moses chapter 4, verse 3**, the Lord reveals the very nature of the war in heaven. Satan's proposal was ""to destroy the agency of man, which I, the Lord God, had given him."" The reason Satan's plan was so evil was not that he wanted a different outcome, it was that he wanted to achieve it through compulsion. This scripture reasons that any system that moves away from invitation and persuasion toward force and constraint is a system that edges away from God's plan and toward the philosophy of the adversary. We must therefore be exceptionally careful that our church policies are structured to honor and protect agency, not to diminish it through high-pressure tactics.

The Doctrine and Covenants itself champions this idea of proactive, voluntary righteousness. In **section 58, verses 27 and 28**, the Lord declares, ""Verily I say, men should be anxiously engaged in a good cause, and do many things of their own free will, and bring to pass much righteousness For the power is in them, wherein they are agents unto themselves."" The Lord’s reasoning here is that true righteousness comes when we act for ourselves, using the power within us, not when we are compelled or commanded in all things. A mandatory, checklist-based system discourages this kind of proactive agency. It encourages a passive, ""tell me what to do"" mentality, which is the opposite of the robust, self-motivated discipleship the Lord seems to envision for His saints.

# Theme 3: The Primacy of Grace and the Atonement

The most beautiful and central doctrine of Christianity is the Atonement of Jesus Christ. It is the belief that we are saved not by our own perfection, but by His grace, which makes up for our inevitable shortfalls.

Paul is the great apostle of grace. In his letter to the **Ephesians, chapter 2, verses 8 and 9**, he makes one of the clearest statements on salvation in all of scripture. He says, ""For by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of God Not of works, lest any man should boast."" Paul’s reasoning is that if we could earn our salvation through a perfect performance of works, we would have reason to be proud of our own accomplishments. But salvation is a gift, received through faith. A system that places such a heavy emphasis on perfect adherence to a behavioral code as a prerequisite for worthiness risks creating a culture of ""boasting,"" where members might, even subtly, believe their own strict obedience is what makes them worthy of the temple, rather than the cleansing blood of Christ.

The Book of Mormon beautifully harmonizes with Paul's teaching. The prophet Nephi, in **2 Nephi chapter 25, verse 23**, provides the defining statement on the relationship between grace and works in the restored gospel. He writes, ""for we know that it is by grace that we are saved, after all we can do."" The key phrase is ""after all we can do."" This acknowledges our effort but ultimately places the saving power in Christ's grace. A rigid, all-or-nothing interpretation of the Word of Wisdom can warp this doctrine. It can make a member who slips up feel that they have not done ""all they can do,"" and are therefore cut off from grace and unworthy of the temple. This is a spiritually damaging misunderstanding. The conclusion should be that our ""worthiness"" for the temple is not a state of sinless perfection, but rather a state of humble repentance and reliance on the Atonement.

Moroni provides our final, crucial piece of evidence on this theme. In **Ether chapter 12, verse 27**, the Lord teaches him, ""And if men come unto me I will show unto them their weakness. I give unto men weakness that they may be humble and my grace is sufficient for all men that humble themselves before me."" The Lord’s reasoning is that our imperfections and weaknesses are not a mistake in the plan, they are a feature. They are designed to humble us and to turn us constantly toward His all-sufficient grace. A policy that has a zero-tolerance approach to certain weaknesses seems to work against this divine purpose. It encourages hiding weakness rather than humbly bringing it to Christ. It creates a standard of perfection that the Lord himself says we do not need to meet, because His grace is sufficient.

# Theme 4: Continuing Revelation as a Tool for Adaptation

Finally, my study led me to the principle that makes the entire Church a living, breathing organism: continuing revelation. This is the doctrine that allows for course correction and adaptation.

The **ninth Article of Faith** is the foundational claim. It states, ""We believe all that God has revealed, all that He does now reveal, and we believe that He will yet reveal many great and important things pertaining to the Kingdom of God."" This is our institutional license for change. The reasoning is that the heavens are not closed. We are not bound forever to the policies or cultural applications of the 1830s.

The Lord himself establishes His right to change His own directives in the **Doctrine and Covenants, section 56, verse 4**. He says, ""Wherefore I, the Lord, command and revoke, as it seemeth me good."" This scripture gives the living prophet full divine authority to revisit and, if necessary, revoke or alter a past policy or commandment when it is no longer serving its intended purpose for the good of the Saints.

The mechanism for this change is also clear. In **Doctrine and Covenants, section 1, verse 38**, the Lord states, ""What I the Lord have spoken, I have spoken, and I excuse not myself and though the heavens and the earth pass away, my word shall not pass away, but shall all be fulfilled, whether by mine own voice or by the voice of my servants, it is the same."" This final piece of evidence reasons that the voice of the living prophet is, for us today, the same as the voice of God. He has the authority.

My exhaustive scriptural search leads me to a single, powerful conclusion. The principles of focusing on the heart, protecting agency, relying on grace, and adapting through revelation are not minor themes. They are the central pillars of the restored gospel. A mandatory, rigid application of the Word of Wisdom and other lifestyle rules does not seem to harmonize with these pillars. It seems, in fact, to stand in direct opposition to them. This dissonance is the source of my deep and prayerful concern.

# Part 3: The Data - The Painful Gap Between Official Policy and Lived Reality

My Berean search, which began in the holy scriptures, eventually compelled me to look at the world around me. A principle of God, I reasoned, should not only be theologically sound but also bear good fruit in the lives of His children. I wanted to see how this mandatory application of the Word of Wisdom and other high-demand lifestyle covenants was truly affecting the Saints today. I began to search for data, looking for academic studies, sociological surveys, and responsible reporting conducted by faithful members or respectful observers who sought to understand the modern Church. I was not looking for anti-Mormon literature; I was looking for honest self-reflection from within the community of faith. What I discovered was not a triumphant story of a ""peculiar people"" united in obedience. Instead, I found a heartbreaking and statistically significant gap between the Church’s official pronouncements and the actual, private lives of a huge portion of its members. The data painted a picture of a silent, widespread crisis of integrity.

The first area I investigated was adherence to the Word of Wisdom itself. I found a study which provided a stark look at the reality of the situation. It indicated that **only 45% of American Latter-day Saints reported full abstinence from all the substances prohibited by the Word of Wisdom.** This number alone was staggering. It suggests that more than half of the entire body of the Church in the United States is not living in full compliance with the letter of this law. The number was even more concerning when it looked at the most active segment of the Church. Even among those members who attend church weekly, full compliance only reached 53 percent. This means that nearly half of the people sitting in the pews on any given Sunday are, by a strict definition, not fully living the Word of Wisdom.

The most shocking statistic from that same research concerned those who are considered the most ""worthy"" and committed members: temple recommend holders. The survey found that among members with a current temple recommend, **18% reported having had coffee in the past six months, another 18% reported having tea, and 11% reported having had alcohol.** These are not inactive members or critics. These are dedicated, tithe-paying, meeting-attending, covenant-making members who have sat across from their bishop and stake president and affirmed their worthiness to enter the Lord's house. Yet, a significant minority of them are privately not adhering to the very standard they are publicly affirming.

The second area I researched was the covenant of wearing the temple garment. This was more difficult to study, but a recent 2022-2023 survey by the Latter-day Saint RELIGION Survey provided a powerful, if sorrowful, glimpse into this sacred and private practice. The survey found that among endowed members—those who have made the covenant to wear the garment always—**only 54.5% reported wearing their garments at the time they took the survey.** While a larger number, 73%, reported having worn them at some point within the last week, this still reveals that a significant portion, more than a quarter of endowed members, are not living this covenant on a daily basis. The data also showed a strong generational trend, with compliance rates being much lower among younger generations than among older members, suggesting this is a growing, not a diminishing, challenge.

As a researcher, I had to sit back and ask myself what these numbers truly mean. They do not mean that Latter-day Saints are bad people. They do not mean they are rebellious or unfaithful. On the contrary, they seem to be trying their best to navigate an impossible situation. What these statistics truly reveal is a profound and painful disconnect between the de jure law of the Church and the de facto reality of its members' lives. A huge portion of the faithful body of the Church is already, in their private and conscientious decisions, living as if these principles are matters of personal devotion and choice, not absolute, binding laws.

This data forces a difficult conclusion. The current mandatory policy does not appear to be creating a culture of simple, joyous obedience. Instead, it seems to be creating a culture of cognitive dissonance. It forces countless good people into a terrible choice. Either live with a constant, nagging sense of personal failure and guilt for not meeting the ideal, or misrepresent their behavior in worthiness interviews to maintain their social standing and access to the temple. It places bishops in the untenable position of being either unknowing receivers of dishonest answers or unofficial negotiators of the Lord's commandments. This gap between our public pronouncements and our private realities is a wound in the body of the Church. It is a source of silent shame and institutional hypocrisy that is neither healthy nor sustainable. The data does not show a people united in a peculiar practice, but a people quietly struggling under the weight of a standard that a significant portion of them, for whatever reason, are not fully meeting. This discovery transformed my theological concern into a deep, pastoral concern for the well-being of the very people I hope to one day call my brothers and sisters.

# Part 4: The Implications, The Solution, and The Glorious Effects

My journey as a Berean investigator, a journey that started with a simple question and led me through the depths of scripture and the sobering realities of data, now brings me to its final and most important destination. It is not enough to simply identify a problem. A person of faith must also seek, through inspiration and reason, to envision a solution. What are the true consequences of maintaining our current course? And what glorious possibilities might await us if we had the collective faith to choose a more excellent way? This final section is my humble attempt to outline those two paths. It is my vision for the future of the Church, a vision I have prayed over with all the energy of my soul.

# The Implications: The Unintended Consequences of the Current Policy

First, we must be unflinchingly honest about the subtle yet pervasive harm the current mandatory policy is causing. This is not a system that is simply ""not working perfectly."" It is a system that, for all its good intentions, is generating a host of negative spiritual and social consequences that ripple through every level of the Church.

For the individual member, the current system creates a culture of spiritual anxiety and shame. It presents a standard of perfectionism that is unattainable for many, fostering a constant, nagging sense of personal failure. A good person who enjoys a cup of green tea for its health benefits, or a returned missionary who finds that a morning coffee helps them focus at a demanding job, is forced into a state of perpetual unworthiness. This is not the ""joy of the saints"" that the scriptures promise. It is a quiet spiritual burden. It encourages hiding and dishonesty, forcing good people to choose between being transparent about their lives and being considered worthy to participate fully in their own faith community. This is a terrible choice to force upon anyone. It erodes personal integrity and replaces a relationship of grace with a relationship of fear.

For the family, the consequences are equally painful. The policy creates artificial divisions between loved ones. It can mean a father who is otherwise a loving, devoted parent cannot baptize his own child because of a struggle with the Word of Wisdom. It means non compliant family members can feel like second class citizens at temple weddings, literally shut out from the family’s most sacred moments. It creates a dynamic where righteousness is judged based on external behaviors, allowing a family member who is privately cruel or prideful to be seen as more righteous than one who is kind and loving but drinks coffee. This is not the unity and eternal love the gospel promises. It is a source of friction and sorrow in the one unit that should be our greatest source of strength.

For the Church as an institution, the implications are vast. It acts as a massive and unnecessary barrier to conversion. As an investigator myself, I can attest that these specific lifestyle requirements are culturally alienating and often feel arbitrary to those outside the faith. They become the primary focus of discussion, overshadowing the beautiful, central message of the Restoration, the Book of Mormon, and the Atonement of Jesus Christ. We are leading with our most peculiar rules, not with our most transcendent truths. Furthermore, it is a primary driver of inactivity. Millions of wonderful people have drifted away from the Church not because they lost their testimony of God or Joseph Smith, but because they could not or would not maintain this specific high demand lifestyle. The current policy acts as a great wall, preventing their return by reinforcing a sense of shame and permanent disqualification. It drains enormous time and spiritual energy from our local leaders. Our wonderful Bishops are forced to be investigators and judges of behavior, spending precious interview time probing into dietary habits rather than ministering to the deeper needs of the soul.

# The Solution: A Prophetic Return to a More Excellent Way

The solution I envision is not a radical invention. It is not a concession to the world. It is a courageous and faithful **return to the original scriptural standard.** It is a solution that requires no new doctrine, only a prophetic course correction in policy and application.

The solution is that the President of the Church, exercising the full authority of his apostolic office and acting on the will of God received through revelation or even only scripture, would announce that the Word of Wisdom and the covenant of wearing the temple garment are to be returned to their original status. They would be re framed as sacred, beautiful, and deeply personal principles with promise. They would be taught, encouraged, and celebrated as wise counsels from a loving God, invitations to a higher level of physical and spiritual well being.

However, they would no longer be used as mandatory, gatekeeping requirements in a temple recommend interview. The questions would be removed. Adherence would become a matter of personal conscience and private devotion between a member and God. Worthiness for the temple would be realigned with the ""weightier matters"" that Christ and the Book of Mormon prophets emphasized. The interview would focus on our faith in Jesus Christ and His Atonement, on our testimony of the Restoration, on our commitment to being honest and charitable, and on our efforts to sustain our families and keep the more universal commandments.

# The Glorious Effects: A Vision of a Restored Church

If we had the faith to make such a change, the positive effects would be immediate, widespread, and glorious. This would not be a lowering of the standard. It would be an elevation of our entire faith.

First, it would **restore profound institutional and personal integrity.** The painful gap between our official policy and the lived reality of our members would be closed. The culture of shame and hiding would be replaced by a culture of honesty and grace. Members would be free to approach their covenants with a full heart, driven by love and personal devotion, not by institutional pressure or fear. The entire Church would feel a collective sigh of relief.

Second, it would **open the floodgates for a new era of growth.** The single greatest cultural barrier to entry for new converts would be removed. Missionaries could focus on sharing the core message of the gospel without getting bogged down in defending cultural peculiarities. At the same time, it would build a golden bridge for millions of inactive members to return home. It would be a powerful message from the Church that says ""Your struggles do not define you. Your heart does. Come back. We want you."" It could potentially usher in the most significant period of growth and reactivation in the history of the Church.

Third, it would **refocus our discipleship squarely on Jesus Christ.** It would shift our collective measure of worthiness away from a behavioral checklist and toward the true heart of the gospel. We would learn to judge ourselves and others less by what they consume and more by the Christlike love they radiate. It would be a powerful move away from any semblance of modern Pharisaism and toward the pure religion of the heart that Jesus taught. Our people would become known not for what they avoid, but for who they joyfully embrace, our Savior.

Finally, and perhaps most importantly, it would be a **monumental, global testimony to the reality of a living prophet.** Far from weakening his authority, such a move would demonstrate it in its fullest and most awe inspiring measure. It would prove to the world that the heavens are not closed, that God is still guiding His people, and that our prophet is not merely a caretaker of tradition but a bold and inspired channel for continuing revelation. It would be a modern echo of the 1890 Manifesto or the 1978 revelation on the priesthood, an act of prophetic courage that would strengthen the testimony of every member and declare to the world that God leads this Church today. This is the beautiful, thriving, and honest church I can see. This is the vision that my Berean search has given me.

# Part 5: My Conclusion and My Personal Course of Action

So I must ask myself, after all this, what am I to do? After weeks of diligent searching through the scriptures, after hours spent poring over data and wrestling with the implications, after praying with all the sincerity of my soul for clarity and understanding, where does this journey end? As someone who stands on the threshold of this faith, not yet a member, I know my place. I have no standing to demand change. I have no right to tell the leaders of the Church how to conduct their affairs. I believe firmly in the divine order and structure of the restored Church, an order that places the responsibility and the keys for guiding the entire body upon one man, the President and Prophet. To engage in public protest or to foster a spirit of contention and division would be to violate the very spirit of the gospel that has so deeply touched my heart. That is not the path of a disciple of Jesus Christ.

Yet, I also cannot in good conscience simply do nothing. I cannot un-read the scriptures I have read. I cannot un-see the painful disconnect I have discovered. To remain silent would feel like a betrayal of the very Berean principle that set me on this path. It would be an act of intellectual and spiritual cowardice. I believe that God expects us to use the minds and hearts He has given us, and to act with faith on the truths we discover. I am faced with a sacred duty to be true to what I have learned, while simultaneously honoring the priesthood authority that I have come to respect and sustain.

Therefore, after much prayer and meditation, I have concluded that there is one path forward that is both completely faithful and completely honest. It is a path of quiet, respectful, and persistent communication. It is a path that acknowledges the prophet’s unique role and appeals to it directly, in a spirit of utter humility and trust. It is the path of a single, earnest voice speaking its truth in the proper channels, believing it will be heard.

My personal course of action is this. I have decided that I am going to write a respectful letter to President Russell M. Nelson. In that first letter, I will lay out my entire journey, just as I have done here. I will detail my scriptural findings, my analysis of the data, and my heartfelt vision for a more grace filled future for the Church. And then, I am going to continue writing. I will write one letter every single week, without fail. Each letter will be unique. One week I might focus on a deep dive into the meaning of the word ""constraint"" in Doctrine and Covenants 89. The next week I might share a personal story of a friend who has drifted from the Church over these very issues. The week after I might explore the missiological implications for the Church in Europe or Asia.

This approach is similar Andy's quiet, persistent faith in ""The Shawshank Redemption."" He didn't scream or riot for a library. He wrote one letter a week, every week, for years. His act was not one of rebellion, but of unwavering, dignified belief in a system he hoped would eventually respond to reason and rightful petition. Similarly, this letter writing campaign is not a protest, but a consistent, respectful, and faithful appeal to the Church's highest authority, trusting that sustained, sincere inquiry, like Andy's letters, will eventually be heard and prayerfully considered, leading to a long awaited and much needed positive change.

Let me be perfectly clear about my intent. This is not a pressure campaign. It is not a protest. It is an act of profound and abiding faith. It is my personal, solitary witness. It is my way of ""mourning with those that mourn,"" by giving voice to the silent struggle of the thousands of members reflected in the data. It is my way of ""standing as a witness of God at all times and in all things,"" by taking the truths I have found in His scriptures directly to His chosen mouthpiece. It is an act of faith in the character and spiritual sensitivity of President Nelson, a belief that he is a man who would want to know about the struggles of the flock. And ultimately, it is an act of faith in God Himself, a belief that the heavens are open and that sincere, persistent prayer, even in the form of a weekly letter, can be heard.

I share my entire journey and my personal plan with you all today not to start a rebellion, but to offer a template of faithful action. I do not ask you to agree with me. I do not ask you to adopt my conclusions as your own. I would never presume to do so. I simply invite you to follow the Berean example for yourselves. Take these questions and these scriptures back to the source. Search them out in your own study. Pray about them with real intent. If, after your own sincere and prayerful investigation, you find yourself arriving at a similar place of concern and hope, then I invite you to consider what your own faithful course of action might be. For me, the answer is to write a letter, and then another, and then another. Perhaps for you it will be the same. I believe that one voice can be ignored. But millions of individual, respectful, and faithful voices, all speaking the same scriptural truth in a chorus of sincere and private communication, cannot be easily dismissed. They become a data point that cannot be ignored. They become a testament to the collective heart of a people yearning for home.

If you feel so moved, after your own study and prayer, to join me in this quiet, persistent, and faithful act of communication with the one man who can seek the Lord's definitive will for our time, here is a template and the address where your voice can be sent.

The Office of the First Presidency  
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter day Saints  
47 E. South Temple Street  
Salt Lake City, Utah 84150-1200

Dear President Nelson,

I am writing to you today as a \[sincere investigator of the gospel / faithful member of the Church / Bishop / Stake President\] with a deep love for the restored gospel and a profound respect for your office as Prophet, Seer, and Revelator.

My personal study of the scriptures, particularly Doctrine and Covenants section 89, has led me to a question that I prayerfully bring to you. I understand that the Word of Wisdom was given ""not by commandment or constraint"" (D&C 89:2) and was ""adapted to the capacity of the weak and the weakest of all saints"" (D&C 89:3). It appears to me that the current mandatory application of this principle, as well as the covenant of wearing the temple garment, as requirements for temple worthiness may not fully align with the original intent of these revelations or with broader scriptural themes of agency and grace.

I have seen data suggesting that many faithful members struggle with these requirements, which can lead to feelings of guilt or a need to be less than fully transparent. My sincere hope is that the Church might, through continuing revelation, consider returning these sacred principles to a status of voluntary devotion, rather than mandatory requirements for full fellowship and temple access. I believe such a change would bring many souls closer to Christ, strengthen the Church globally, and be a powerful testament to your inspired leadership.

Thank you for your tireless service and for considering my heartfelt prayer on this matter. I sustain you as the Lord's prophet.

Sincerely,

\[Your Name\]

\---

Thank you for taking the time to read my entire story. I welcome any additional thoughts, insights, or scriptures that I may have missed in my search. May God bless us all in our individual efforts to come closer to Him and to understand His will.",1,1750800384.0,mormon,3,1.0,False

Now mind you I work a minimum wage job and can barely afford to eat some weeks. I'm 21 and have been taking care of myself since I was 17. I understand my mom isn't in a much better financial situation than me but it's inconvenient. I simply don't have the money to buy self care items sooner than I anticipated. I asked her nicely to stop using my stuff because I don't have the money to replace it like that and she went off on me. Saying things like ""oh like you've never used my shampoo before?"" yes but not consistently to the point it's almost empty. and ""well then stop using the toilet paper and coffee etc I buy."" All I did was ask for her to stop using my self care things. I save up and buy good quality stuff when I have the money and like I've said I can't keep replacing it.

1ljni70,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1ljni70/aio_by_bringing_how_my_girlfriend_hasnt_supported/,AIO by bringing how my girlfriend hasn’t supported me?,"My partner and I have been together a few years and things are falling apart, especially communication. 

I’ve been dealing with health issues basically as long as we’ve been together and it’s debilitating. I can barely brush my teeth or wash my hair without pain and exhaustion- just to put in to perspective how difficult everything else is compared to simple daily activities. 

Because of that it’s impacted my ability to work. I have been working since we started dating but I’ve missed alot of work. I missed over 100 days last year and still brought in 46k. So I’ve been able to contribute financially but she’s taken on a lot of that. 

Plus the emotional and mental burden. I know its taken a toll on her 

Anyways, I last year I was doing everything I could to better myself- eating well, moving a lot, following my drs treatment plan, prioritizing sleep and rest, supplements, and seeking alternative treatments like acupuncture and other stuff. I was also in the process of finding a therapist. 

Then we got into an argument, and she kind of blew up and said that I’m not doing anything to better myself. I was really taking it back because I feel like I was doing so much and when I asked her what she meant, she said “you’re not in therapy and on antidepressants”.

I felt dismissed and belittled because it felt like she was diminishing all of my health issues as depression. I know I’m dealing with depression because I’m depressed because of how limiting my health issues are, but I know it’s more than depression. The depression is a reaction to my symptoms and how I feel stuck in them, and it sucked because it seemed like she didn’t recognize all the stuff I was doing for myself. 

It wasn’t until a recent brain scan show that I have a bunch of plaque in my brain that she seemed to actually start to believe me, and her behavior and demeanor completely changed, and she became super supportive and comforting in a way she wasn’t. It’s not that she wasn’t supportive and comforting before, but it was different. I don’t know how to explain it, but it just seemed more authentic. Like she was actually genuinely concerned for me now whereas previously it seems like she didn’t think there was anything wrong with me but depression.

Fortunately, further scans showed my brain is healthy, but we’ve continued to get an argument about this and I brought up how she dismissed me, referencing the fight where she told me I need a therapist, and she flat out denied it and accused me of bringing up the past.

It’s frustrating because I don’t feel like me referencing something that’s happened in the past and that is still happening is me bringing up the past. I’m trying to put context to things that are continue to happen and also how it’s colored my perception and how it’s affected me etc. 

There was also another argument where she blew up and said that “everyone’s tired, we just get on with it”. Having talked with my doctors and been diagnosed with certain conditions. I know that my fatigue and exhaustion is not just “tired”, and having been a normal healthy person before I can relate to being tired in the past and how different it feels now when I’m so exhausted, I can barely function. 

So I basically have just felt dismissed, even though she has been supportive, it feels like support with a lot of resentment and contempt, as opposed to caring.

And I know it’s a lot to put on her, or for her to take on, and I’m trying my best to get better and I’m also doing my best to support her in the ways that I can- by helping her raise her son, by making 99.2% of all meals, cleaning, laundry, chores, making her coffee in the morning, taking her car to get the oil changed, etc. 

Those are definitely things I would be doing even if I wasn’t in this position, but I’m doing my best to make sure that she’s taken care of as well .

We’ve just been arguing a lot more and I’ve brought up how dismissed I felt and how I feel like she hasn’t supported me in a lot of ways because it felt contemptuous and resentful and it felt like she didn’t take my condition seriously until very recently and she just is upset that I think and feel that way and still denies that she dismissed me even though I say that’s how she made me feel.

CHRIS MINNS Another Labor Puppet for organised crime?","This is what's happening Australia wide right now! 

Murders disappearances and absolute LIES by authorities covering over the disappearances and murders of young men.

With deceitful untrue theories about these very many deaths with untrue claims of suicides misadventure and accidents. 

WAKE UP AUSTRALIA 

The Illuminati is real!

How do you think Jeffery Epstein died? 

The Illuminati put a violent prisoner with him on a deal to reduce his sentence to protect the Clinton's and Trump. 

The Clinton body count is a conspiracy theory centred around the belief that former U.S. President Bill Clinton and his wife, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have secretly had their political opponents murdered, often made to look like suicides, totaling as many as 50 or more listed victims.[1][2][3] The Congressional Record (1994) stated that the compiler of the original list, Linda Thompson, admitted she had ""no direct evidence"" of Clinton killing anyone. Indeed, she claimed the deaths were probably caused by ""people trying to control the president"" but refused to say who they were.[4]


Virginia Guifre was murdered, she did not commit suicide and her family were scared of what happened, so they have heeded the warnings and shut up. 

Virginia knew the intimate details about Prince Andrew and was paid millions of dollars compensation.

She moved to outback Western Australia, and still she was murdered. The lady had no reason to commit suicide with beautiful, dependent children. 

In Australia, violent prisoners are placed with witnesses in prison to threaten and silence those prisoners because their testimonials by them were a threat to others, particularly the police.. 

Princess Dianna was harassed endlessly, then involving a high-speed accident caused by that chase. 

Sergio Cuesta in Melbourne disappeared, and he was involved in drug crime. FULL MOON❗️

Dieter Brummer from Home and Away was involved in drugs. FULL MOON ❗️Murdered

Erwan Ferrieux and Hugo Palmer were at a gay beat, vehicle was in the carpark, towels and belongings at the beach, police allege both died by drowning. FULL MOON ❗️ Murdered

Two mths later, Theo Hayez is removed by the son of the police man's brother and a known friend of Greg Saenger Murdered ❗️

Greg was also close friends with the Ibrahim brothers, whose father is in prison for the importation of 20kgs COCAINE. 

Theo was removed from a nightclub by the son of that policemans brother on false pretences claiming the Belgian was intoxicated. 

Without speaking to him, OR asking any questions to determine if he was intoxicated, he very simply followed his instructions and removed him and took him for a photograph as required and told him you were out of here.

Shannon Mackie stated Theo was approaching intoxication without any questions or conversation to determine that. He had got the phone call from Dan, an engineer who worked for Greg.

Theo then went to meet other guests from the hostel who had been texting him constantly at the club, interfering in his evening. 

Theo had already refused to accept the invitation to attend the beach doof as he wanted to go out with females, not males.

After meeting at the cricket nets, waiting for others to arrive from their work places ending their shifts at 11pm, everyone invited met at the meeting place.

They all went to the beach party following the local boys Marc, and Joseph who had lived at the Arts Factory Hostel for a long time.

When everyone arrived at Dayne's Doof there was much going on where Theo wentbwith his friends from the hostel Aaron and Brad and was led into the area behind the camp fire where he was immediately set upon by the older drug fuelled and intoxicated gay men in the dark

His phone and light was taken from him.
The location details was switched off on his unlocked phone.

He was assaulted and escaped, chased up that headland and cornered, silenced and pushed to his death. 

To hide his body, the persons involved in the attempted rape and his then attempted murder traversed the headland, finding him badly injured.

Where Lucifer used the weapon ""THE JUDGE"" to silence him.

Cutting him further with the knife and fed him to the sharks wherebthat culprit involved was becoming covered in Theo's blood as seen in the image from the culprits own Facebook profile image.

Due to the genesis of the disappearance being a police family member,  the weapon that was found blood stained by community members involved in that large search of Byron Bay, was never tested for DNA. No forensics testing was completed. 

The evidence was destroyed by corrupted officers involved in the Tweed Byron and Richmond commands.❗️

NSW Police refuse to answer questions by the Police Minister  and the Attorney General and Premier. 

The hostel staff who attended the beach doof knew what occurred to Theo being assaulted but not seeing exactly what had occured at the top of that headland.

Ged was with them when Luccio, Max and Lucifer cornered Theo on that Headland where the cliffs were. Theo did NOT slip on loose shale, he was forced to the edge and pushed off falling onto the rocks below

The hostel work for free accommodation staff did not report the Belgian missing for 6 DAYS! 

That wad done intentionally to allow all video evidence of all associations to be completely overwritten on the 7th day and a video loop overwrite.

The increasing tides height allowed all the blood to be washed off the rocks. 

Ged who was involved in the chase being a confused gender diverse lost soul and searching for purpose in life, had told Jay Notaro what happened at the Coomera police Station after he was spotted working at the university coffee shop and reported to police.

He was contacted by police and he very quickly quit his job and confided in the Qld Police Inspector about what had happened that night.

Jay Notaro has since disappeared because he was another threat to those involved in the Belgians murder.

Jay was in Byron Bay for a few nights and had been asking questions from what he had been told by Ged.

Jay became ill and was unable to attend his own b'day celebrations the ladtbnightbhevwas in town being due back at work the next day.

Jay did not commit suicide as the rumours were spread around Byron Bay.

Jay Notaro's vehicle was taken yo Broken Head ca Park early in the morning.  His car was seen entering thatch parking area but Jay was not seen.

His keys were left in the vehicle, his surf board was found 500 mtrs northwards up the beach with no damage to it or the leg rope.

The Australian Easterly Current travels southwards not northwards

Nobody witnessed the ripped physically fit man at the beach that morning. 

No telephone was found.
Jay's car was abandoned by those involved in his disappearance. 

Jay had been silenced also.

Another silenced was an actor from Home and Away plus he was now a well respected Lawyer.

Ben Unwin was pushed off from the top of a 100 mtr waterfall at a  FULL MOON ❗️

Ben was an eyewitness to the assault of the Belgian backpacker Theo Hayez and had also attended the beach doof party held at Cosy Corner Byron Bay 31st May 2019

Another who was silenced was Taiki Kano, who had been staying with his newly acquainted friends at Nimbin that took him to the beach doof party. 

Taiki was last seen running naked through the streets of Coffs Harbour attempting an escape from those involved at the doof party only to be found the next morning floating face down in a dam 300KLMS AWAY. 

He, too, was silenced as a witness of the Belgian backpackers murder. FULL MOON❗️ 

Anthony Stott, a Brisbane School teacher who had attended the beach doof party returned from South America after travelling overseas. 

He had known and witnessed what happened, landing in Brisbane, and driving straight down to meet up in Byron Bay, not his home in Brisbane and only to be chased down the M1 sometimes driving erraticly without his headlights on, attempting to evade his attackers.

Only to make an emergency stop in the centre median to evade that chase of him.

He approached the nearest house and then only for them to think he was there to steal their marijuana crop, kidnap him, beating him senselessly and then releasing him in the early morning. 

Anthony staggered back to his car, and when attempting to flag down a truck in his confused concussed state from that kidnap and beating was struck and killed by that truck he was seeking help from.

Anthony was another from the doof party, and was another eyewitness of the Hayez assault.

He was also silenced albeit a consequence of him being chased to create the emerged stop, kidnapped and near beaten to death with fll concussion. It was a FULL MOON. ❗️

Terry McGurk still has not been reported as missing by his scared family.

Terry had been assaulted by two men and he brought charges against them for those involved in his rape.

He also attended Dayne's beach doof party and was yet another eyewitness to the Hayez assault. 

Terry vanished after finding himself in financial trouble and he put direct pressure on those involved in that beach assault with his knowledge and eyewitness. FULL MOON❗️

A human skeleton has been found in the Springbrook National Park with a different sized skull to the body. The skull had been swapped to that of a younger smaller size.

Jackson Stacker was involved in the doof party scene and knew his new friends were dealing through the Lucifer. The drug dealer of the beach car park who he claims he has police protection where he does hs deals openly

Lucifer is the one seen pictured on the rocks at Cosy Corner covered in blood. His name was identified by an associate of his that he lived with in 2017.

Jackson was attending a small doof held at Sleepy Hollow, where he too was chased and attacked by knife weilding men who chased him into a cow paddock beside the rest area. 

Jackson was tortured with several fingers cut off, which is a mafia style interrogation. Often seen in the movie.

Beaten with his teeth knocked from his head, and found front down and semi naked during the cold winter's nights on his favourite faux fur jacket.

A large hunting knife with stab wounds and with that same large knife imbedded deep into his chest along with duct tape left beside the body. 

His body was then decapitated, and that skull was scalped. FULL MOON.❗️

Miles Bolton was found hanging from a tree at Brunswick Heads and another from the doof party scene. FULL MOON ❗️

Patrick Leidke was another young man who attended the beach doof party, he too also went missing this time, never to be found with family still searching FULL MOON ❗️

Gage Wilson was a respected DJ and an artistic music creator who attended Beach doof at Cosy Corner. 

Gage disappeared for approximately 11 weeks following his vehicle being chased and crashing at high speed into a tree after hitting a pot hole on the bend of a road.

 He disappeared from the accident scene and his body was to be found 1klm away down a deep rivene in the next valley. FULL MOON ❗️

Mihai Salajanu had told his parents his life was at risk following threats to contact to him to stay quiet about what he had seen at the Cosy Corner Beach Doof party. 

Mihai Salajanu had met Gage that weekend following flying up to Coolangatta airport from Victoria, hiring a car and then a two night stay at an airbnb near Mullumbimby and where he and Gage met up to discuss threats.

Gage was chased and crashed his vehicle. 

Following that crash of Gage's car, Mihai drove all day with a passenger to near Wagga where his hire car struck a kangaroo at night.

Then both the occupants decided to abandon that vehicle and to commence walking to find help

Mihai disappeared that next day after Gage at the same full moon as Gage for nearly 10 weeks up a track near the river when thevtwo occupants were seeking help for their smashed windscreen. They were now in Mafia territory at the Riverina. FULL MOON.❗️

Chris Hardy a nurse from the gold coast had also attended the Cosy Corner Beach doof and was found murdered. 

His vehicle was found at Ewingsdale almost outside the residence where Lucifer's accomplice from thevdoof, assault and the blood covered rocks lives with his Dr bf and approx 10klms away from where his body was dumped at Tyagerah disused railway tracks.

This had been drowned at Grays lane freshwater lake. A known gay beat in the late afternoon.

Many eyewitnesses have been slaughtered to protect the identity of the killer's involved.

People that have been found murdered at Coffs Harbour are also related to the doof party held at Cosy Corner 31st May 2019.

Kai Schaefer was stabbed at the beach early in a beach car park. 

Wendy Hanson, the mother of another whose son attended the beach doof party was last seen near Bundaberg and her body found 860klms away and 400klms from her vehicle.

Wendy withdrew money from an atm, driving to Coffs Harbour where she was murdered and the killer involved then drove 400klms back to dump her car at a train station allowing him to gain access to the train network away from that dumped grandmothers car.

That grandmother put pressure upon those involved in the Hayez assault and was also silenced. 

Wendy's body was half buried in sand dunes at Coffs Harbour.

Taiki Kano was chased naked down the streets of Coffs Harbour escaping his attack upon him.

Taiki also attended the beach doof party held at Cosy Corner Byron Bay and hevslso feed at the full moon❗️

He died at the hands of the serial killer who is hiding in plain sight with full police protection.

Ask why he has protection.
It's because he is not an Australian citizen and is in the country under a special arrangement between the US government and the Australian government.

All state police are instructed to ignore the details.
State involvement with the Ndrangheta mafia is real.
The Illuminati connection is direct and that Illuminati family blood-line Rockefeller is typically cross bred to criminally insane.

ALL SILENCED at a full moon❗️

The Occult involvement is real and the police involved are involved in corruption and conspiracies involving organised crime networks.

The exact same as what was occurring in Kings Cross which resulted in the Wood Royal Commission into police corruption and conspiracies.

NOT SUICIDES ❗️

We were initially acquaintances, but when we both left our firm he asked me to go to coffee and we became casual friends (ie, a text message here or there, lunch once a year). I felt at the time that he had a romantic interest in me, but I was not interested in him then and tried to set him up with a friend of mine. He never messaged my friend.

In 2023, he sent me drafts of a few songs he was working on. We are both music lovers and started talking more frequently, collaborating on the music. At the time, he asked me out on a date but then a few days later said he was not in a place to start anything serious because he had just gotten out of a relationship. We both agreed to move forward as friends. A month after this, I proposed a date but he said he would need to think more about it. I understood and was fine with a friendship.

Our friendship deepened quite a lot over the next 6 months. We talked every day by text or phone call and had dinners and lunches etc. It was so wonderful to connect with him. Then he suddenly pulled away. I tried to get him to engage for a month or so but then let it go. There was a period of time when we didn’t talk for 1.5 months. 

He then called me out of the blue one day and we started talking again. I met his family/friends around this time, but I had my guard up. Having that kind of friendship in my life where I could not let my guard down exhausted me, so I finally asked him to explain why he pulled away. He told me that we had gotten very close over those first 6 months and that he was terrified of exploring a romantic relationship with me. During this conversation, he also mentioned that he felt he unconsciously used me when we were first getting to know each other (I assume to get over his ex?). These words shocked me and I asked him not to talk to me for a year.

Around the holidays, he sent me a short text with an apology for his actions. I responded only to wish him a happy holiday. Then several months after that, I texted him because I missed him. We had a conversation during which he apologized for his actions and I accepted. We’ve been in each other’s lives now and he has been signaling a romantic interest only indirectly. I can’t help but feel I am doing myself a disservice by allowing him in my life. Should I cut him out? If not, how do I rebuild trust here? I like him romantically, and I confess that having him in my life prevents me from dating other men seriously. If I do cut him out, I won’t do it explicitly as before but will just let things fade.

Discovered this month while dealing with figuring out a heart issue that my A1C is very close to diabetic at 6.2% and my cholesterol is also high for the first time ever, so I’m more motivated to continue trying this than I was when I just wanted to lose weight for helping with chronic ankle/joint pain. I’m losing a pound a week which is great, and previously even with consistent exercise I couldn’t lose more than 10 lbs this year and kept going up and down with no consistent success.

I really don’t want diabetes as it runs in my family and I already have enough chronic shit going on with endometriosis, adhd, depression, etc. I recognize this med will be good for me and is needed based on that bloodwork, and am luckily covered by my insurance at $25/month so the barriers all disappeared from trying it out. I also really really really really hate being nauseous and will do almost anything I can to avoid vomiting. I wouldn’t call it a phobia, but it’s an overwhelming hatred. Literally I’d rather have diarrhea or a migraine, I hate it so much. 

I am so uncomfortably nauseous and cannot seem to find a consistent pattern. I am used to being nauseous for 4-6 weeks trying out SSRIs, but cannot deal with it longer than 2 months. I see that the nausea goes up to 30% of patients reporting this side effect the higher the dose. Please reassure me the nausea goes away? I could probably titrate up slower if needed but if it’s this bad on a non therapeutic dose I’m going to really struggle with being more nauseous than I am currently. I’m a teacher on summer break so I can deal right now, but when school starts in August it will be close to impossible to do many of the things I’m trying to alleviate nausea. 

I’m probably struggling with this a little more mentally too because I had to discontinue stimulant meds for last 2 months while figuring out heart stuff. I should be able to get back on them after next week if my psych listens to cardiologist, as I’m also trying metropolol and it’s POTS or inappropriate sinus tachycardia and unrelated to stimulant damage or usage. Physically I can mostly only lay down when it’s bad, or cut my walks very short when I get symptomatic mid exercise. The walks are my mental wellness in general and especially when off meds though, so nausea is really tanking my ability to care for myself and my very energetic cowboy corgi is also bummed. 

Things I’m trying (Did they work for you? Do you have suggestions I haven’t thought of?):

- Eating something about every 3 hours, which is when I seem to be the most nauseous after eating. I wake up feeling great, eat, then die inside for most of the day. I set alarms today to help me, and I’m eating breakfast/lunch closer together and smaller. Sometimes it works and nausea leaves, sometimes it gets worse. Either a bowl of oatmeal with berries and a little brown sugar, or scrambled eggs with tomato, onion, and spinach for breakfast. 

- not waiting to feel “hungry” to eat. Is feeling nauseous the new hunger cue? I already have weird hunger cues from stimulants and can go many hours without eating without noticing until I feel very very bad. 

-trying that Shotsy app, but unsure of how to rate nausea. Like 10/10 to me is barfing? But if it’s 10 hours of being awake that I’m lying there unable to do anything that seems bad too. Can anyone recommend a nausea scale? 

-cbd/thc gummies eliminate the nausea but I cannot take them when I return to work, so this has to be a temporary fix 

- coffee makes me poop daily so I’m not worried about constipation, upped fiber intake with veggies and whole grains. This is hard to do in school year though. I can’t pee until lunch or conference, so eating every 3 hours will also be difficult. 

- cutting out Greek yogurt to see if lactose intolerant. Considering removing sugar to see if it helps, currently have a tbs of lavender syrup in iced coffee daily and one mochi ice cream some evenings. Literally fell asleep after a jelly donut and kolache so already watching carbs as rare treat. 

I know many good things are happening - I’m spending almost no money eating out and preparing fresh food every day, where I was buying frozen stuff and getting DoorDash 1-2 times a week and sometimes more when stressed or feeling really ill from heart. The meds I’m on have lowered my heart rate so I’m not constantly exhausted. I’m losing weight at a rate better than I ever did before and not mindlessly snacking just to snack. I just want to also hike and enjoy my summer too! And know there is light at the end of this barf tunnel. Claire pic for dog tax and joy

1ljna4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Libyan_Expats/comments/1ljna4t/al_naseem_pepsi/,Al Naseem & Pepsi ◇,"I'm sure that everyone has seen on Libyan social media how people are up in arms against the Libyan dairy products tycoon - aka Al Naseem - due to his socio-political views on a televised interview.

Endless posts by angry consumers cry out to boycott Al Naseem products along with Pepsi - due to their involvement with Israeli owned franchises and outsourcing.  

What a load of crap.

First of all, I've been keeping a close eye on Libyan supermarket shelves for the past couple of months - since the boycotting campaign was launched online.

For the first 2 weeks or so; some grocery stores pretended to boycott Al Naseem and Pepsi.  Shortly after, the same stores realised that boycotting these two producers actually backfired at them since consumer flocked to the stores that offered said products.

Al Naseem and Pepsi are too good of a product to by-pass; and Libyans are the least ethically or morally motivated people on earth.

Shops that offered Pepsi cola couldn't keep up with demand and the shelves were wiped clean within 2 days of delivery.

While shops that boycotted Al Naseem only had to offer imported dairy products at double or triple the price tag.

Libyans love big words but they could never take a stand for any principle or cause - let alone when their bellies and pockets are at stake.

Al Naseem produces quality goods at affordable prices and it's a household brand; regardless of the company's socio-political views.  Rumours of boycotting or even minimally boycotting Al Naseem products didn't put a dent in their sales margins.  

Pepsi ? Libyan Pepsi is damn good and it tastes awesome.

I couldn't go a day without a bottle of Pepsi.

All in all, folks pretending to boycott domestic quality brands are full of horse shit. 

By the same token; these folks should boycott all Nestle' products - beginning with the awful tasting and overpriced Nescafe dehydrated coffee - Libyans consume tons of Nescafe not just at coffee shops and at home but its used in cakes and desserts too.  

Personally, I've switched to the richer tasting, German made, Stella dehydrated coffee - and they got a Gold version too.

But that's another story. 

Point is, consumers can't be rambling about boycotting certain brands and by-passing so many products that have direct or indirect ties with Israel.

Nonetheless boycott a household brand due to their socio-political views.

Drink Pepsi, eat Al Naseem yoghurt and just live it up 😄👍

It has taken a little over two years for me to realize that ""The Bowl"" of old, ""The Bowl"" that SLF moans and cries for, is gone and is never coming back.  The New Sugar has similar features, but is NOTHING like what the aging SLF'ers are waxing nostalgic about.

Almost EVERY time I'm been on SLF I've felt like I'm reading about a parallel universe that is NOTHING like what I'm experiencing in the real-world here every day or week.  I get attacked by aging SLF'ers for being ""wrong"" or making up my facts...

... but now I realize that practically NONE of them are actually active, and they are mostly talking about The Bowl of a Previous Era.

The Sugar Dating Sites are are not what they used to be.  Sex Work and Vanilla Dating have ALSO evolved.

The latest ""ah ha"" moment was earlier today when I saw a woman on SLF ask about whether should be be nervous about going to a man's house for an overnight on the first date.  And separately there was a well-respected ""SB"" moaning about those of us that suggest a ""coffee date"" as the first date...  and although I haven't see the dreaded condom issue talked about in a few days, I'm sure it'll get dragged out soon...

Here's the reality:

* 31 first-dates in 19 months (24 from SugarSites 7 vanilla)
* 7 came directly to my house (24 met in public)
* 10 didn't vibe well on 1st date (2 remain good friends)
* 19 resulted in additional dates AND SEX.
* 3 asked about condoms (I happily wrapped up)
* 0 1st dates were at fancy restaurants.
* 0 1st dates required travel of more the 35 minutes.
* 10+ sent nudes without me EVER hinting about wanting.
* 3 talked about marriage.
* 29 year Age Gap average.
* 350 average PPM (or allowance equivalent of aprox 1,800)
* 15 white
* 7 mixed (OMG!!!)
* 5 black
* 4 latina

What's my point?  Sugar Sites are creating a new generation of connections.  The old ways of Sugar are dead.

Embrace the change.  Have DATES not ""M&Gs"". Have SEX not ""intimacy"".  Get tested and educated about the irrelevance of most STI's.

I have a colleague who is 35f and im 25f
Weve known eachother for 3 years now and I've suspected for a while that she may have feelings for me and ive developed quite real feelings for her. She told me shes leaving the job next week and i dont know what to do about it. 

We work in different departments. But since the days she arrived we've got on. Shes super shy and also from a European country her English is like 85 percent perfect shes basically fluent. 

She has a boyfriend and two young kids. I KNOW.
Shes told me before she doesn't know why she chose him and she needs to stay with him because of the kids. She is very private with her family and doesn't get her kods to spend time with anyone. I have met her kids
And because quote close to them after seeing them a few times. She sends me pictures of them every now and then and confided in me that she feels like a bad mother sometimes due to her English. She asked me to help her. We've gone to the arcade with her kids after work and and I've been to her house hanging out with her kids. 

I call them my  'best friends' and they have seen other people who work at our hotel and she told me they don't smile at them, only me. 

At work, she sees me every morning at 7am and i say 'Bring me a coffee' and she goes 'No way get your own' and brings me a coffee anyway. It doesn't matter what im doing she will say good morning we will ask about eachs lives and have morning coffee in her office. All our colleagues have said, and commented that if i am not around i will be with 'Anna' and if they can't find Anna she will be somewhere with me. 

We tease each other all the time and i speak her langauge (Bulgarian) and we always say 'Idiota' 'Kakvo' etc and 'da' 'ne' and i can never get 'kakvo' quite right and she makes a stupid face at me every time. She pretends to hit me with her clipboard, calls me idiota, and if i do something wrong she will call me a nickname i hate and say she knows that shes the only one who can call me that. She'll ask me for coffee and i tell her 'Ask me nicely, Say Molya'  (please) and she will smile up at me and do it every time.

She tells everyone that im her bestie. That im her English teacher etc

Now the thing is she always stands way to close to me, gets me specifically to do her favours and sign paperwork. I will be looking at my computer screen and will FEEL her gaze on my halfway across the building. Sure enough, she will ALREADY be looking at me and we grin and stare. This happens 10x a day. We just KNOW that we are looking for one another. I have never had this with anyone.  When we talk we just grin and laugh and tease each other. 
She told me her mother 'Likes the british' and i said 'she'd like me then' and she just grinned and said yes. Her mother is even friends with me on Facebook. 

Ive told her my brother is a police officer and she was joking and going 'Hes going to arrest me, for you know...' 
When i press her, she just smiles and grins. 

Ive even said she 'likes British people' I said 'Huh, sorry did you say what I think you just said' and she goes 'UHM NO. um I said uh what rooms I need to check' and i go 'Oh yes here you go Anna, all embarrassed so now you pretend to say something else don't you?'
And she just grinned and rolled her eyes.
 

We've gone out for coffee together etc and hubg out with her kids. Ive even joked that im the kids dad and she nodded and laughed. 

She was away for 1 year on maternity leave and the day she came back she made us do a whole photoshoot of us 'back together' thoigh we texted all the time through it saying we missed eachother

Recently I've started calling her 'Mechka' which means bear. It annoys her but she lets me do it. Its my nickname for her. I told her i was proud of her for getting her promotion and she looked genuinely moved before i quickly did our dance of 'Okay ill pretend im bullying you again.' 

At the moment we've started  saying 'I dont care that you're leaving' and she replies 'good, i dont care either.'

She's always asking for me on my days off and tells me she wpuld turn up at my house one day randomly etc

Once we had a fight about something dumb and she ignored me at work and it wad shitty. She said during that fight. 'We're just colleagues. Not friends. Not...more than friends now' 

I had a girlfriend for a while and we broke up. Even sfter we broke up, at a staff drink party Anna insisted we take selifes and far far too many selfies. But she kept saying 'dont post them (my ex) will know where we are and come and find me!' my other colleagues found this weird but funny. 

I'm going to give her a gift, a little bear and a card to just give her something nice. 
Im debating telling her in our playful coded langauge that i like her and i suspect that she likes me to. 

But, i dont know if its worth it or if I'm imagining things. She also said that we will meet still and hang out. I want to respect her, her kids and her relationship first of course but i dont know what to do

Am i being dumb? Am i imagining all this?

Her: “Well, I was popular.”

Me: “Okay I hear you, but it sounds like you’re stoking your ego a bit by saying that, no?”

She got really upset and felt hurt by what I said, and said I was rude for saying that she sounded egotistical. She ended our friendship over this.

1ljn1x0,https://www.reddit.com/r/CreepCast_Submissions/comments/1ljn1x0/hide_and_seek_after_school/,Hide and Seek After School,"It was the third time she had seen the boy that day. He wore an orange and black windbreaker, black cargo pants, and carried a red Jansport backpack. He had short, thick black hair that stuck out straight from his scalp. His skin was pasty white. That’s all she could recall. She couldn’t even describe his face as she was never quite close enough to discern his features. There was nothing particularly significant about him. He by all means should have been forgettable amongst the many students she would encounter on a daily basis at Jefferson high school, which boasted upwards of fifty five hundred students during a low year.

 Yet she noticed him everyday, just at the cusp of her periphery. Across the hall, the courtyard, even on the sidewalk leading to the school. As soon as she’d notice the familiar scheme of colors she’d whip her head around to get a better look. And he’d be gone. Leaving her puzzled over something so trivial. *Did I see what I saw? Does it matter?* 

It hadn’t mattered to her the first few times. *Then again, when were the first few times?* By the time she had been taking note of this strangely mundane occurrence, the strange feeling had already crept in at full force. It had likely been about a month by then, though she could not be sure. Now she found herself scanning her surroundings, actively looking for the boy. She’d even casually inquired to her neighboring teachers about him the past few days. None could offer much clarity. Not that she could have expected much with her vague descriptions. Still however, she could not shake the feeling of being the only one to experience it. Whatever it was. 

She was contemplating that very thought as she sat at her desk, full of miscellaneous papers, gazing out the window from her classroom on the third story. Despite all her good intentions she got very little to nothing done. She looked at the time. *Shit.* It was 4:56 and the sun was setting soon. Teachers were not allowed to stay past 4:30p.m, at least not without prior notice to faculty. Not that anyone enforced it however. It was likely due to the need to lock up before the staff went home as janitors were greatly understaffed these days. She much preferred to leave before then anyway as the gates and doors to many of the buildings would be locked in, causing one to take the long, winding way to the parking lot out the main entrance, or worse, be trapped within the corridors between buildings. Something that almost happened to her last week. She rose from her chair stiffly and was about to reach for her bag to pack up when she noticed out in the courtyard, for the fourth time that day, the brief, but undeniable scheme of orange, black and red colors of the boy’s outfit. Her eyes caught the last remnants of his figure as it walked and disappeared beyond her sight towards the main building. Her building.

Her chest tightened. She turned her head to glance around the room. It was dark. Something she was accustomed to as she hated the harsh fluorescent lights, but with the setting of the sun she quickly made her way over to the switch to flick them on. With the remaining few minutes before the clock struck five she swiftly packed her things and left the classroom. 

A quick peek out into the hallway revealed no one. Not even Linda, the janitor. *She did mention she had moved to morning shifts*. The hallway was silent. There was no familiar sound of one pushing on the metallic crash bar of the door, the ones so common in the major entrances of public buildings. She dismissed her thoughts as silly however. Quiet and still as it was, she couldn't possibly hear the sound all the way up from the third floor. *Did the boy enter the building? Is he hanging out by the wall beyond her sight?* In the earlier weeks, when her realizations of the repeated nature of these sightings became clear, her friendliness and curiosity had her prepare a few icebreakers should she finally encounter him face to face. *Hello! I’ve seen you around quite often, do you have a class near mine? Like Ms. Ochoa?  Or Mr. Peters?* She’d imagine he would respond with a *Me too! And yes, I actually have Mr. Adams!* Or some other reasonable explanation to his relative proximity to her on a daily basis. Today however, she was not feeling so curious. A quick glance at her phone revealed it was 5:05. With that, the few tepid steps became great strides as she power-walked her way to the nearest exit. 

She strode down the hall praying that the door at the end of the hallway would open. She could have just as easily taken the three flights of stairs down and straight out the front entrance to spare her the trouble, but today she figured she would take her chances with the side exit. *To save time.* She thought to herself. *The janitors are probably somewhere on campus and haven't locked up all the gates yet*. Sometimes, she would take the long way around school only to see, much to her annoyance, that the side exit opened all along. The latter option could double the length of her walk, but she decided to take her chances. Upon making it to the end of the long hallway, she pressed every so gently on the crash bar. The door gave way. 

A burst of cool night air met her as she entered the open corridor, the sky taking on a purple tinge, the last warm hues sinking below the horizon. Above her were the half cylindrical metal grates that connected one ledge to the other, an adjunct feature that did not come with the original design of the school. *To stop anyone from accidentally falling.* Or so told herself in light of the recent tragedies that befell this school. The passageway connected the main building to the other wings, and only a short stretch away was the other door. She walked to it hurriedly and gave it a pull. It did not budge. With a quick glance over her shoulder, she pulled again, hoping she was mistaken. Nothing. A slight panic began to settle in. She whipped around and swiftly made her way back to the other door. *Oh please*, with her last few steps back towards the door she made a reach for the handle and pulled. To her surprise and relief, it gave way. She let out a sigh, “Thank God\*.”\* she breathed aloud. *It must not have closed all the way.* She reopened it and made her way back into the hallway. Her heartbeat settled as she juggled her binder and Stanley cup, still half full of water, and glanced once again at her phone. 5:09pm. With a deep breath, she knew she would have to leave through the main exit. 

She padded down the stairs, attempting to make as little sound as possible. She had made it down to the second flight when she began to feel a bit silly. “Just don’t wanna trip\*,”\* she muttered to herself. “It’s just me here- *\*CRASH\*.* Her heart stopped at the familiar sound of the metallic crash bar from the floors below. Silence. She held her breath. Every muscle in her body tensed up. She dared not make a sound. *Is it Linda?* With bated breath she waited anxiously for the friendly sound of a trash can being pushed on wheels. None came. A minute of continued silence passed. Then came the sound of slow, steady footsteps ascending the stairs. 

She froze for a second, listening for the sounds coming her way. To her horror, the footsteps become gradually quicker. She gasped and turned around, leaping up the stairs three steps at a time. At the top she pushed her way back through the door with a loud *crash*, reentering the third floor. A split second decision led her to dash down the vacant hallway once again towards the door leading to the west wing, as she did not trust her trembling hands to unlock her classroom door in time. *In time for what*, she did not know, though she had no time to think why, just that she desperately needed to escape. She ran the length of the hallway in a few seconds, and a glance at the door revealed that it was slightly ajar. She pushed it open silently and ducked behind it, letting the door swing softly without fully coming to a close.

The footsteps had made their way to the last few steps. She dropped her things to the concrete floor beside her, and crouched closely behind the door, right under the small glass rectangular window. Her ears caught the dreaded sound of the crash bar as the owner of the footsteps finally entered the third floor. She futilely crossed her arms in an attempt to stop her hands from trembling, but the rest of her body continued to shake. She bowed her head and tried to calm her breaths. Certainly whoever was up here would complete whatever business and leave. She waited for the sound of keys, the turning of a door handle, more footsteps, anything, but none came. Several minutes passed as she remained crouched, ears straining for a sound. 

Minutes passed, and not a single sound echoed in the hallway. And it was of course at that moment that she suddenly felt the dire need to relieve herself. The initial panic had subsided, and left her with a deep dread. Her legs and knees began to ache, likely due to the extra 40 pounds she had accumulated over the last several years of pent up stress from work. *I’m getting old.* An unpleasant thought usually, but one that was welcome in that moment so long as it could distract herself. Anything to help her pass the time until she felt certain she was alone. 

Several more minutes passed. She had refrained from looking at her phone as last she checked she was at three percent battery life, but decided to reach into her pocket anyway. 5:23pm, her phone revealed before she quickly turned off the screen. *I have to make just one phone call.* She’d never been on campus this late save for the occasional parent teacher conference night, and even then, with the bustling hallways of teachers, parents, and students alike, she found it eerie. Though still could not bring herself to peek through the glass window to see if the coast was clear. So she waited. 

This feeling was uncannily familiar, and her mind wandered to moments of hide-and-go-seek she would play in her childhood. She had no problems squatting for a prolonged period of time, but it was always her tiny bladder that would lead her to compromise her hiding spot. She was notoriously one of the worst at hiding amongst her cousins as she would never venture out into dark spaces, instead electing to hide behind curtains, under tables, behind doors, but always in a well-lit area. She didn’t care to win. She just wanted to play. She smiled in spite of herself. 

She dared not breathe a word for fear of being heard, but decided she could send a text to one of the administrators, hoping that they would check their phones during dinner. She could wait after all. As long as someone was coming for her. though she had steadied herself enough to instead reach into her bag for her phone. Her heart fell as a click of the unlock button would yield only a dark screen. Her eyes welled up with tears as her initial anxiety gave way to pure panic. She held a hand over her mouth and began crying, and couldn’t help but remember the child she was all those years ago. 

She recalled that one chilly evening, when she was about four. She had found a nook in the backyard behind some bricks. Delighted to have finally found a well lit spot that would not leave her to once again be the first one caught, she crouched behind the bricks and used a couple of fallen tree branches to cover her and waited. No sooner had she assumed her position did she feel the all too familiar need to relieve herself. That time however she was determined to win, and she waited. Every passing minute brought her joy as she was certain that everyone else was likely being found, and she had been so proud of herself that she didn’t even notice the sun beginning to set. There was still light in the sky as far as she was concerned, but as soon as the wait had begun to take its toll on her, the sky too quickly became dark. Upon realizing this, her joy dissolved into silent panic. The stack of bricks in front of her allowed her very little visibility of the backyard around her. The tree branches she had meticulously placed above herself for the purpose of eventually being uncovered now suddenly seemed like a necessary protection. Protection from what, she wasn’t sure, but her mind wandered from ghosts to creatures lurking in the dark, waiting for her to come out. She could not bring herself to get up and leave for fear of being found by whatever lurked in the shadows outside of her little hiding place, so she waited. 

She waited for what felt like an hour. She waited until finally she could not hold it any longer. She felt a moment of relief as her pants became warm and wet, and soon became uncomfortable as the cold set in. Frozen, aching, and terrified, she began to cry softly to herself, stifling her cries with her hand for fear of making any noise that would give her position away. She waited for another hour, until finally she decided to brave a peek above bricks. Her aching legs found great relief at her slow ascension. With her small fingers, she moved a leaf aside to take a peak. Darkness. She quickly crouched down again. There was nothing. She took a couple more minutes to steel her nerve. Then she decided. She burst out of the branches and leaves and jumped over the bricks, knocking a few down and ran. She ran like there was something chasing her, and when she turned to see the dull yellow light emitting from the screen glass door she banged with all the might her little fists could muster and wailed to be let in. Moments later the blinds were twisted and moved to reveal her mother to whom she screamed for. That night she would be carried in, scolded for peeing her pants rather than simply coming inside, and ridiculed by her cousins who had decided it was too cold to play outside that evening and ditched her to watch a movie inside.

A grown woman now, all she wanted in that moment was to also run into her mother’s arms. But there was no such comfort. She wiped her tears thinking she was silly to be feeling this way. Then she decided. 

She slowly raised herself to take a peek through the small glass panel to what was certain to be an empty hallway. Her heart stopped. He was there. She became numb. She brought her hand to her mouth to muffle her cry. The boy was there. He was at the other end of the hall, standing. Facing her classroom door. Waiting. To her horror, she could finally make out his face. The dark void of his mouth was agape, the corners of mouth turned up into a smile. She watched him frozen in terror, until the slightest turn of his head caused her to duck so fast that the strap of her tote bag fell off her shoulder and released a couple pens that rolled out on the ground beside her. Her hands trembled violently as frantically grabbed at the pens. After gathering them all she clutched them to her chest and crouched down as low to the ground as possible, willing herself to be smaller.  

She waited and closed her eyes, but could not shut out the image of the boy. His face somehow was still indiscernible, like a vague shadow. A haze. His eyes were dark and empty. With shuddering exhales, she wondered if he had seen her. *Maybe he didn’t?* He seemed too focused to notice her, and she had only taken a quick peek. Her neck grew stiff as she didn’t dare look up through the glass panel again. She hoped to stay close enough to the door to hide herself from his view had he decided to look outside the glass, realizing too late that pressing herself against the door would force it to fully shut with a sharp *click.* She froze in horror. Her head bowed, body crouched, she waited for what would certainly be footsteps going in her direction. Several minutes passed. But none came. Her pants flooded with relief. 

She waited for hours more. She decided she would wait for the light. The humiliation of the janitor or admin potentially finding her the next morning with her pants soiled paled in comparison to the prospect of being saved from the boy. *The boy -or whatever he was-* she thought, willing the image of his face from her mind, *I’m not alone. Someone is coming for me.* 

By daybreak she was freezing, but the relief she felt at the faint glow of the sun promising to come over the horizon gave her hope. A tear of joy trickled down her face. Only a few hours more and she would be saved. Her body however, ached tremendously from staying still so long, and her feet were asleep. She decided to take her chances with a stretch which she decided would be silent enough to go unnoticed by the boy, if he was still there. She unfolded herself, straightening her back slowly, each silent pop of her vertebrae was a sigh of relief. All the while she was careful not to rise above the glass panel. She then slowly craned her neck up and backwards, her eyes closed, craning it circles a few times to work out the kinks. Upon a final rotation, she once again tilted her head backwards, and upon opening her eyes to see the beginning lights of the sun rising above the horizon, was met with, to her abject horror, the dark, empty eyes of the boy smiling down at her from behind the glass.

“A heart attack?” cried Principal Slater, followed by a breathless, “Jesus. That’s awful.” His wife, who was fixing his morning coffee in the kitchen, looked across the living room with concern. 

“Yes, we do actually have a protocol for those who stay late on campus, but- o-okay. Yes, we can talk more when I’m there. Thank you. Yes, I’ll be there in 15 minutes.” He hung up and placed a palm to his forehead, brushing back his receding hairline.

“What’s wrong?” His wife asked.

“Ms. Tran died of a heart attack.”

“Oh my god. Wait, when?”

“Just a few hours ago. Apparently she was trapped between the buildings after hours. First the PTA getting on my ass about students fooling around and jumping off the ledge, and now this.” He put on his jacket with a sigh. “Like I didn’t already have enough on my plate.” He reached for the coffee his wife fixed him. “Thanks dear.”

“You’re welcome-” she managed to get out before he brushed past her as was out the door. She looked out the window to see his car hurriedly pulling out of the driveway and zooming down the street. She stood there long after he left, sipping her tea. She had actually met Ms. Tran a couple of times. A lovely woman, she remembered, but she was always so stressed. *Her heart probably gave out from the workload.* And as much as she loved her husband, she knew he was not doing enough to support his staff, and how that lack of support was likely trickling down to the students. But she dared not say anything. *What do I know?* Her husband had been the sole provider for them all these years, she never had to lift a finger. *I should be grateful. I have no grounds to critique him.* She let out a deep sigh, ready to drop the situation, when just then, out of the corner of her periphery, a young man -a student she assumed- walked away down the street towards the direction of the school. She didn’t even notice him passing by her house despite being right there looking out at the street. But what really bothered her was that this was not the first time she had seen him. Of course, it was not abnormal for her to see a student walking to school, yet this one she felt unsettled by, though she could not pinpoint why. She was quite familiar with the neighbors and their children, so perhaps that was why. She made a mental note to bring it up to her husband over dinner, but would have to save it for another time when he would come home late that evening complaining about the emergency teacher union meeting he had been called to attend to discuss teachers “not receiving enough support.” Throughout his tirade, nod and occasionally validate him, all the while desperately trying to remember the boy’s face from earlier that morning.

There are four maple trees in my backyard (Sugar Maple) and so far I've made two walking sticks from two different trees from large branches that fell off.  For this stick, I decided to go a different route; I wanted it to be colored, stained, and finished naturally. I first colored it with fire, as I did my with my last stick. For staining I found out that there are natural ways to stain wood. One way, is with strong brewed coffee (strong instant coffee also works too) ! I went with instant coffee and made the coffee ratio higher than the water ratio until it look like a wood stain consistency.  For a natural finish, I used beeswax and orange oil wood polish and conditioner.  Overall, I'm pleased with how everything turned it.  This stick is naturally shiny from the beeswax polish, but it's not glossy like from a polyurethane wood finish.  This stick is 57 7/8 inches tall and is heavier than my last stick.

They ordered food along with coffee, a Dr Pepper, and an orange juice.

After I brought everything to the table, the woman claimed she found a long blonde hair in her food after she had already eaten most of it. The odd part is—no one on staff has blonde hair.

It was only 7 a.m., and I didn’t have the energy to argue, so I comped her meal just to keep the peace.

When it came time to pay for the drinks, she got upset and started yelling at me because the orange juice was more expensive than the coffee and soda, then demanded a discount. At that point, I was pretty fed up, so I calmly said, “I’m sorry you feel that way. You're welcome to contact corporate if you'd like to discuss pricing.”

She left without tipping, but thankfully, her father did and even apologized for her behavior.",13,1750798966.0,CustomerFromHell,3,1.0,False

1ljmvbv,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ljmvbv,The WORST and most confusing customer I have ever had- cost me Star Seller for the month 😤.. but then became a great customer?,"This customer.... yikes. So my shop recently had the best month it's EVER had. It took almost a year to get to 200 sales, and then for the month of May alone I had 200 sales 👏🏼🥹❤️

With that big of a boom in sales, that means more... interesting... customers are about. The petty ones. The ones who don't read/are unaware of things. 

This item had a processing time of 2 weeks so I could give myself time to make it with love and not be rushed. 

Even with a ""ship by"" date of June-something I got this out VERY early for this customer anyways in May. While it was in transit, she tried to leave me a 3-star review without the product even being in her hands yet because it was held up in the post office for a couple of days and she tried to make that somehow my fault.

I flagged the review and Etsy removed it for me. But it DID knock my near perfect ratings and mess with my average. I've never had a 3-star rating.. ever...

That coupled with a few new 4-star ratings, even though those 4-star customers ""loved"" their item and ""would 100% recommend it""... all cost me Star Seller for the first time after a year straight of achieving it every month 💔😭

Here's the wildest part- SHE PURCHASED THE SAME ITEM AGAIN THE SECOND THE FIRST ONE WAS DELIVERED TO HER!!! 

I didn't know what to think. Was I being set up? Is she pissed her review got removed and is looking to leave an even worse review for this one? Should I decline the sale?

So you know what I did? I made the order. I made and shipped that order so fast (2 weeks ahead of schedule) and packaged it with extra love and stickers and little extras and made sure she got it extremely early this time. Even earlier than last time. 

And you know what she did?

Left me a 5-star review in return. 🥹❤️

This could've gone so many ways but I'm glad I just said ""eff it. Let's go."" And made it regardless. 

Customers are so unpredictable. You literally never know who is ordering from you and how they are. Even if it's the same person! 

Keep pushing, keep grinding! A little over a year of being open and I am finally over 400 sales 🥹👏🏼❤️🎉✨️

has been these days. But if anyone is just wanting to take a mild break from them, I do feel L-Theanine + drinking coffee in the morning on an empty stomach, really does work and helps with focus. For some it may not, but maybe look into your diet, how much sleep you got the night before, and what mental state you’re currently in. I find that i actually can get work done and focus on L-Theanine alone but with coffee? EVEN BETTER. While it may not be as strong as adderall itself or work for everyone, it’s worth a try. Even if I do still take it after eating, I will get a little pep in my step. I like to use this holistic approach on days i want to take off from adderall.  And if you notice, when you take those breaks, and then go back to using your adderall, I feel it does work better. However i have only been recently diagnosed with inattentive ADHD at the

At first, I just thought she was pretty. We were both in a poli sci class, talked every now and then, and bonded over football and plans to attend law school. I got her to come to a meeting of my club once. I followed her on Instagram, but she took weeks to accept, and didn’t reply to something I sent her, so I assumed she wasn’t interested in me. We had another class together the next semester, and this time we talked more, though she often seemed drained after class when I tried to talk to her. She came to my club again, which was nice. The one thing that kept my hope on life support: we had to sign up for project groups, and she switched out of one to avoid a guy we both disliked when I told her he was in her group, and she signed both of us up together for the very last spot. 

In the leadup to spring break, I took a leap and asked her to study for our midterm together. I was very anxious she’d say no, because it would be joever after that. But she said yes, and I even got her number out of the deal. We “studied” twice that week, for 4 and 6 hours respectively, and barely touched the material because we couldn’t stop talking. She told me about this theory that Skittles taste the same when you close your eyes, which I called nonsense, so she said we’d test it with my friends sometime. I was delighted with how that had all gone.
The day of the midterm, I waited until she finished to turn in my exam just to say goodbye to her before break. She wasn’t in the professor’s office though, so I figured she was gone, until she snuck up behind me, since she’d taken the elevator and not the stairs. I was like what the heck, but we got to talk more before parting ways. Over the break, I started getting very nervous because she barely replied to texts, so I was convinced I had stopped being useful to her with the exam over. She did reply when I asked her how to do the Skittles test though, and she was kind of right about it, I got 40% of them wrong.

When we got back from break, I figured she wouldn't talk to me. But when she saw me, she said hi, and asked me about my break, turns out she had read my texts. She explained she’d been in D.C. for a program, and was busy much of the break and she thought she had told me, which was a relief. After class, I assumed we’d part ways after a brief chat but instead, she asked if I wanted to sit outside since it was such a nice day. I was jumping for joy at that, which I had *never* expected. We talked for 4 hours, and I got to meet her best friend. She invited me to a cooking night with her group, but I had plans with my friends and didn’t want to seem like I didn’t have a life. She told me she was baking cookies that night, and I jumped the gun and asked if I could have some, and she said yeah that’s where I was going with that. A couple days later, she plopped a bag of them on my desk when she arrived for class, and I was in a pretty darn good mood the rest of the day. 

She agreed to come play mariokart with me and my friends the next day, and she got along well with my friends, mainly by roasting me and she stole and wore my Mario hat right off of my lap. I’m pretty good at mariokart, and when I won our tournament, I jumped on the table and shouted “Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked” at her and the two friends I beat, a line she uses to this day. She stayed for four hours. She was supposed to join me for mariokart again the next day and never replied that day or the next. She later texted me saying she had a really bad migraine and felt awful about missing it, and we could hang out soon if I wanted, which calmed my anxiety. 
After that, everything sort of took off. We started getting coffee before class every Thursday, hanging out weekly at the library, and texting more often. We gave each other nicknames: Diva or Divaaa over text for me since apparently I have severe only child syndrome, and Smittles, a portmanteau on her surname and Skittles, for her. I’m a weird person and though I’m an American I love the British monarchy, so I say God Save the King as my parting phrase, and she started saying that back to me along with the other weird things. She brought me to an event she was covering for the campus paper. One time I mimicked a joke we always referenced and she burst out laughing, telling me, unprompted, “You’re funny.” I asked if she was being sarcastic since I struggle with that and she said “No, you really make me laugh"" She helped me with an application for a program she got into (I didn’t bc my gpa sucks), and when I told her the bad news, she said she was really sad because she’d been excited to do it with me. 

I even risked showing up to her job on campus one day with a brownie when I noticed she hadn’t been listening to music for like a day on the airbuds app, something she’s always doing, so I knew she had another bad headache. and she seemed touched that I checked on her. We ended up talking for 30 minutes when I’d only meant to be there for 5. She sent me pictures of her cats, and asked to work on our group project with me even though she only had 2 slides to do, which I didn’t think was necessary but I never turn down time with her, and I thought she just wanted to hang out. It all started to feel very very good.

From there, we just became part of each other’s routines. I suck at deadlines and thus struggle in school, so said she'd keep me accountable next year by getting my syllabi and making sure I was keeping up with all my work in a timely manner. She got sad realizing we wouldn’t see each other over the summer. She came with me to the candy store off campus, then we grabbed smoothies, which was actually her idea. She even came back to my place briefly, and my roommate who was always shipping us got to see us when we were there. She also said she really wanted to meet my parents, since before I had said she could meet my mom when she came to get me at the end of the year. Before we parted ways she said, “I really enjoyed this.” When she mentioned going to a frat dinner that evening as someone’s date, I panicked, but she must have noticed this because she said they were going as friends, she didn’t want to go but was too nice to say no, and would only stay two hours. Based on her airbuds app activity and when she started texting me again, she indeed only stayed for two hours. The next day, she didn’t have anything good to say about it, so that finally laid my fears to rest.

We studied together for finals. She kicked me under the table, and also jokingly unplugged and tried to steal my laptop, and our hands met when I was taking it back from her. We got breakfast before our poli sci final, and she told me she’d miss my jokes. When my mom flew in, I asked my mom about meeting her, so my mom invited her to dinner with us. and my mom adored her. She said to me that evening, “I approve… that girl really likes you.” I wanted to believe it but I was too nervous to confess how I felt to the girl and I completely choked, so I texted her that night just to say she looked nice that day and I said something about how she was really smart. She replied: “Well thank you! For all of your compliments :) I’m really tired but I did have a lot of fun today.”

I thought that was my last chance to see her before summer but then she texted, asking if we could get breakfast the next morning which we did. She said she’d miss my jokes, and we promised to stay in touch over the summer. We specifically planned to call and play minecraft together. She walked with me to my last exam, and we said goodbye, but I felt really hopeful, whereas after the dinner I had almost cried saying goodbye to her. Even now that we’re home for the summer and living in different states, we’ve stayed close. She texted me the day I flew back and again a few mornings later just to say “good morningg.” We've called six times so far in the past 40 days, and two of them she initiated. We’ve also begun playing minecraft together a few times. She’s told me I make her feel safe and comfortable and she reiterated that she’s going to hold me accountable for my schoolwork next year because I’m “like a genius,” and that it would be tragic if I got in my own way like I have.
She remembered my birthday, texted me happy birthday as soon as she woke up and even used my joke nickname for it “National Salvation Day.” She recalled the names of my high school friends and asked for updates on them. She told her mom I wished her well after an injury. She remembers tiny things I said in passing and didn’t expect her to remember. She even told me she had at one point looked up my Instagram to show her sister what I look like. One day I texted her and she said that it was spooky because it came just seconds after she woke, and when I told her she’s done that to me before, she said, “I think our minds have been slowly wired together after hanging out sm.” She asks a lot about my social life and wants pictures of my friends. When I said over call that I love making her laugh, she seemed genuinely touched and said no one had ever told her that before. I joked that I was glad at least found me funny, and she replied: “You are funny.” 

You may be thinking, “c’mon man, after all that, of course she likes you” but the devil on my shoulder that says she doesn’t like me in a romantic sense is very often in my head for a few reasons that cause me deep uncertainty. She’s called me a friend before which isn’t inaccurate,  but hearing it stings a little. I’ve made a point never to use the word friend to refer to her to her face. She copies my phrases, but so do others, and maybe I’m over-reading it. She fist-bumped me instead of hugging me on two occasions, saying she would hug me if I liked hugs, since I told her before that I didn’t like hugging non-family members, and it left me wondering if I was being friendzoned. I’ve seen male-female friendships that are very very close before but never became romantic, and I can’t help but fear she just sees me as her best guy friend or like a brother. She’s never said that, but it gnaws at me sometimes. Maybe she’s just very nice in general and doesn’t realize how deeply I read into all of this.

1ljmnzq,https://i.redd.it/g6yozqtbux8f1.jpeg,"🧵 [GUIDE] Your Complete Shopping & Selling Handbook: Kitty’s Korner, Tonawanda’s Handmade Heart","If you’re on Reddit looking for genuine local craft spots, chances are you’ve come across phrases like “craft store Tonawanda”, “handmade gifts Buffalo”, or “support small business WNY”. Let me tell you—Kitty’s Korner at 67 Main Street in the City of Tonawanda is exactly that mixed bundle of creativity, community, and hand‑made sincerity you’ve likely been hoping to find.

Here’s why this place rises above the fluff and earns repeat foot traffic, heartfelt reviews, and an ever‑growing network of buzzing vendors and loyal customers.

⸻

1. A One‑of‑a‑Kind Treasure Trove for Hunters of Handmade

Walk in and you’ll be greeted by colorful, hand‑crafted displays from local Makers. Expect everything from hand‑whittled woodwork and one‑off resin art to plush crochet characters and melodic wind chimes. And that’s not even scratching the surface.

The magic here is in its variety and authenticity—something that big-box chain stores can’t touch. Stuffed shelves, rotating inventory, and heartfelt craftsmanship—this is what you’ll find when you type “good craft store near me in Tonawanda” and stumble upon Kitty’s.

⸻

2. Weekly Vendors Keep the Energy Fresh

Every Friday and Saturday (weather permitting), Kitty’s rolls out select outdoor tables right outside the store. For a small fee, anyone—seasoned artisan or hobbyist—can bring their creations and sell them live, interactively.

That means every weekend can surprise you with new makers, new creative angles, and new conversations. Plus, it’s a great way for local creators to engage the Buffalo and Tonawanda communities in a way that feels personal and electric.

⸻

3. Kitty’s Kittens: The Youth Entrepreneur Corner

One of the most heartwarming parts of the store is the “Kitty’s Kittens” section—the youth vendor area. Imagine a middle‑schooler with their own display, selling hand‑dipped candles or painted rocks, living their first taste of entrepreneurship.

You’ll walk in and see hope, creativity, ambition—proof that local kids can dream and sell. That authenticity hits hard, and seeing a kid learn their business muscles is a special, uplifting experience.

⸻

4. Real Relationships = Better Shopping Experience

It’s not just the products—it’s the people. Kitty’s feels like walking into someone’s living room, but it just happens to be packed with art.

The owner and vendors know their stuff. They chat you up, ask about your day, help you choose a handmade gift with a story. Dog lovers? Bring your pup! Kitty’s even stocks pet treats just for your furry friend.

This friendly environment means you shop with heart and leave feeling uplifted. Bit of a vibe, minimum.

⸻

5. From First Visit to Tribal Belonging

The community here self‑completes: once you visit and buy something, you feel linked in. It’s easy to become a “repeat customer” or “support local artist” without even noticing. The mix of stocked quality, rotating vendors, and that welcoming personal touch all blend to foster that sense quickly.

People come for something specific—like a custom gift—but wind up coming back just because they like who they’re buying from.

⸻

6. More Than Just a Shop: Events, Collabs, and Connections

Kitty’s frequently hosts local workshops, guest maker features, and themed group sales events. Want to learn to crochet, weave, or paint? They’ll bring in an instructor, announce it on Facebook, and sell tickets. They boost local creatives and ask people to invest in learning, not just buying.

That means every visit you turn into an experience, not just a transaction.

For example, I prefer to tag transactions with more specific descriptors like “bar” or “coffee shop” instead of broader categories like “Dining & Drinks.” I even find myself wanting to apply multiple labels to a single transaction — like tagging something by place (“Cowboy Up”), type (“bar”), and activity (“drinking”, “friends”) to get more insight into how different aspects of my spending overlap.

The downside is that doing this manually is pretty tedious, especially since I have to create new categories frequently and review them for accuracy. I’ve even thought about switching to a spreadsheet to get the flexibility I want.

Is anyone else doing something similar for more granular tracking? Do you think it’s worth the extra time? I’d love to hear what systems or apps (if any) have worked well for people who want a more detailed view into their spending.",1,1750798248.0,personalfinance,8,1.0,False

I'm looking to buy my first ""serious"" home espresso machine, I'm a long time user of my Gaggia Baby Class that definitely did the job, and want to invest on something that gives me more consistency ( and looks cooler in the kitchen hehe)

I came across this two interesting models from ITOP. IT CM6004 and IT CM S1.

I completely appreciate there isn't much information on them, so i would really love your opinion on their specs to help me make the choice.

I'm a big fan of Flat White, Latte and classic espresso, so these are the drinks for which I'd be using the  machine.

The CM S2 looks more professional and costs £750 vs £400 for the dual boiler version of CM6004,  wondering if it's really worth the £350 difference.

Thank you in advance, I really appreciate any help.

I was advised that after my cervical and vaginal biopsy I would have some coffee like discharge. However, only now 5 weeks later this discharge slowly comes out.

Has anyone else experienced this?

Also 5 days after the biopsy I suddenly started to experience twitches/spasms in my vagina/bladder which I thought would be due to a UTI/BV which I was dealing with but now that these are cleared, theses symptoms are still there.

Has anyone experienced this? Is it just the tissue healing? The spams drive me insanse and are quite uncomfortable.

They said I’d be on crutches for 2 weeks, which I thought was the end of it, but it turns out I won’t be able to drive anywhere for months. I can still walk, I can still take transit, but _legally_ I can’t drive. I know I’ll go stir crazy if I have to stay in a house for 3 months without being able to leave. It’s been making me really think about how shitty car centric infrastructure is

I’m currently in El Paso short term and it is simply _not viable_ to exist here without a car, period. I wouldn’t even really be able to go on walks outside cause all that’s out there is highways and big roads. So I look for other options

I was gonna get the surgery done by where my parents are so I could hang out with them since they’re retired and will help me out. They live in an area that’s so remote that, if they’re not home, I literally can’t even order DoorDash because there’s maybe 5 restaurants. There is no sidewalks where they live, even. You can’t really leave the house without a car

Okay whatever they live in a remote area. So I look at some other options, maybe staying with my brother. He’s in Southern California. The nearest coffee shop is a 30 minute walk from his place, and that’s basically the first thing that’s not housing, so anything else is _even further_

So now I’m like “fuck… do I just rent a place in Boston or New York City for a few months?”. And, of course, since walkable places are so far and few between, these destinations are _unbelievably_ expensive, even for short term stays

It’s gotten to the point where I think about applying to a digital nomad visa in Spain so I can just get the surgery there and at least be able to have a decent standard of life for a few months

What’s so crazy about this is that I work remotely, so just imagine if you didn’t and lived in a car dependent area. What then? You just kinda give up your job to get this surgery? I know there’s FMLA leave, but you don’t even get paid during that, and most people don’t wanna drain their bank accounts just to sit at home and be bored to tears

Like why don’t people see the problem with making cars _the literal only viable form of transit_? Do people not realize that if they lose the ability to drive, they’re fucked?",35,1750797918.0,fuckcars,12,0.94,False

Clicking on the video, I was greeted by a woman wearing only a lace bra and no panties.
She smiled provocatively at the camera, then bent over and took an erect shaft into her mouth like a hungry beast. 
""Yeah, just like that, deep throat, bimbo!"" 
My breath hitched when I saw the familiar tattoo on the man's crotch—a phoenix with my initials ""A.D"" engraved on it.
The same tattoo I’ve traced with my tongue.
The same tattoo belonged to my biker, Luke.
A wave of silent, agonizing pain washed over me, twisting my insides.
————————
Luke:
The diner reeked of scorched coffee, fryer grease, and cheap ketchup that bled onto the chipped Formica tables. The ceiling fan above us clicked with every lazy rotation, doing not a thing to fight the stagnant heat pressing in like a second skin. Rodriguez, my partner, sat across from me, devouring a triple bacon burger like it held the secrets to eternal life.
""I'm telling you, bro,"" he mumbled around a mouthful of fries, ""if I go out with Alyssa, she will be the death of me. I can already see it laid out in her tarot cards now.""
I stirred my iced tea with the straw, the ice cubes clinking against the sides as I let his words wash over me. My eyes scanned the windows, a weird buzz crawling under my skin. It wasn't the heat. It wasn't the terrible case folder we just dropped off. It was something else—a shift in the air, subtle but sharp, like ozone before a lightning strike.
Rodriguez kept talking. ""I thought she was chill, y'know? But she started talking about manifesting our future kids' names on the second date.""
I gave a half-laugh that never made it to my eyes.
That's when I heard them.
The low growl of engines.
It rolled down the block like a war drum. Heavy. Relentless. The kind of sound that makes your gut clench before your brain catches up. My fingers curled around the glass of tea. Rodriguez paused mid-bite.
""s**t,"" he muttered. ""Speak of the devil.""
I turned toward the windows, and there they were.
Motorcycles. Six of them. Not the polished kind weekend warriors ride to feel tough. No, these were monsters in chrome and matte black, snarling and scarred from real street mileage. And the women riding them? They didn't just pull up. They descended. Like they owned the pavement.
My eyes snagged on the last one.
She rode in slow, deliberate. Her black-and-blue Harley purred like a beast under control, and when she slid off the seat, the world f*****g stopped.
5'4. Petite, but curvy. Dark waves of Indigo spilling out of a matte black helmet. Red lips like blood smeared across porcelain. Aviators hiding her eyes, but the smirk on her mouth said she saw everything. Leather jacket undone just enough to tease the edge of a tattoo inked across her collarbone. Jeans hugged lean legs. Her boots looked like they'd stomped more than just asphalt.
The girl next to her said something, and she laughed. Deep. Unapologetic.
And something inside me broke open.
She didn't look at me.
Didn't need to. I knew she could feel my eyes on her.
The whole diner felt her presence. A slow hush rippled through the space. Waitresses froze. Cooks leaned over the pass window. Every person looked.
Siren Syndicates.
I'd heard whispers.
An all-female MC that played by no one's rules. Vigilantes. Outlaws. Ghosts in leather who showed up when s**t needed burning. They didn't follow territory. They followed blood. And there she was, at the helm. No colors patched on her back. Just presence. Dominance. That ring on her middle finger caught the sun, a glint like a blade drawn slow.
Rodriguez leaned in. ""Pretty sure they torched a chop shop last month over in Clay County. Left nothing but scorched rubber and a dickless jerk zip-tied to a lamppost.""
""Allegedly,"" I said, my voice tighter than I intended. My eyes locked on her as she pulled off her helmet and hung it on her handlebar. Her hair spilled out like a promise and a warning.
She leaned back against the bike. Crossed her arms. Sipped from a to-go cup one of her girls handed her. Like she had all the time in the world and knew time would wait for her.
And then she looked right at me.
A glance. A pause. Then that f*****g smile.
Not sweet. Not inviting.
Predatory.
My heartbeat kicked like it wanted out of my chest.
Rodriguez side-eyed me. ""You know her?""
I shook my head, still caught in the stare. ""Not yet.""
He rolled his eyes. ""Golden boy, don't be stupid. That woman would rip your spine out and use it as a kickstand.""
I didn't answer. I couldn't. She moved again, slow, almost catlike. Every motion controlled. Calculated. She walked inside with the others. They filled the back booths, loud and unbothered. One of them slapped a jukebox until it moaned out an old indie track.
I stayed seated.
Pretended to sip my tea. Pretended not to watch her laugh, toss her head back, steal the f*****g oxygen from the room.
Ten minutes later, she walked back out alone. Coffee in hand. She leaned against her bike like it was a throne and scanned the street. Her gaze passed over mine—and this time, it lingered.
A passing moment. Then another.
That same twisted smirk pulled at her mouth.
She kicked the bike into gear.
The engine roared.
She peeled out with a flick of her wrist. Controlled chaos. Her taillight glared red, and just before she turned the corner, I saw it.
The plate.
SIREN-13
Rodriguez said something else about Alyssa and her crystal collection.
I wasn't listening.
No.
I was already chasing a ghost in red lipstick.
And I wasn't about to let her disappear.

Alexandra:
The engine beneath me growled like it had something to prove. She was loud, loyal, and just as mean as I was. When we tore into the parking lot, tires skimming blacktop, the Siren's Syndicates followed in a tight V-formation. Chrome and thunder, steel and fire. Every head inside that diner probably snapped toward the windows before the first boot hit pavement.
Good.
Let 'em look.
I parked last, slow and deliberate. Not because I liked to make an entrance, also I f*****g do, but because watching the world from behind gave me control. A second longer to size everything up. Who was watching. Who was armed. Who was twitchy. Who had something to hide.
The heat pressed down like a fever outside, baking the scent of oil, asphalt, and old grease into my skin. I could smell cigar ash, hot rubber, and last night's mistakes lingering in the air.
I unstrapped my helmet and swung a leg over the bike, boots hitting ground with a practiced thud. The chain at my waist clinked against my gun, a low reminder of weight I carried for more than just style. My girls—Elle, Bex, Wyn, and Kandi—fanned out like a pack of wolves in leather. Eyes scanning. Voices low.
We didn't dress for attention. We were the attention.
My gaze flicked to the street.
A black-and-white cruiser sat across the way. Empty.
Nope.
Scratch that.
One of the windows caught movement. A booth in the corner. Two men. Cops. The one with too much hair gel was waving fries around like he was reenacting some courtroom drama.
But the other one...
He wasn't moving. Wasn't eating. Wasn't talking. Just watching.
Me.
Blue shirt, sleeves rolled. Badge clipped to his belt, forearms planted on the table like he owned the truth and was waiting for me to confess to something.
He didn't smirk. Didn't leer. Didn't do what every other man with a badge or a hard-on usually did when they saw me walk up.
He looked like he was trying to figure me out.
Like he'd been waiting for me and didn't know why.
That? That was dangerous.
I turned away before he could think I cared.
""Luce still dark?"" I asked Elle without looking.
She flicked her lighter. Took a drag. The flame lit her cheekbones like a sinner's halo.
""Yeah,"" she muttered. ""Two days now. Something's off.""
My jaw ticked. Luce wasn't the type to vanish without a heads-up. Not unless she was dead or bleeding.
""We eat,"" I said. ""Then we go look.""
Inside, the diner fell silent the second we stepped through the door. Classic. It always took a minute for the civilians to recalibrate when they saw us—when they realized we were women, sure, but not the soft kind. Not the safe kind. Not the kind they could underestimate.
I scanned the booths, the counter, the exits. The cop was still in the corner. Still watching. My mouth curled just slightly.
Let him watch.
Let him wonder.
We grabbed a booth near the back, the girls slumping into the red vinyl like queens claiming thrones. I moved to the counter. Didn't need a meal. Just coffee. The kind that scalded your tongue and woke up the past.
""Black,"" I told the server, voice flat.
As the cup filled, I turned.
My eyes met his through the window.
Still there. Still watching.
There was no hunger in his gaze. No flirtation. Just intensity. Like I was a case file he hadn't solved yet. Like I didn't fit into the neat little world he knew, and that rattled something.
I lifted my cup in a silent toast, took a long sip, then pushed out the door again. The sun slapped me like a jealous ex, but I didn't flinch. I walked back to my bike and leaned against the seat, leather biting into my shoulders.
I could feel his eyes still on me.
So I looked back.
This time, I didn't smile.
I stared.
I let the moment stretch, my coffee warm in my palm, my heartbeat calm and controlled. One second. Two. Three.
He blinked.
I didn't.
Game, set, match.
Kandi popped out of the diner behind me, chomping on a piece of gum like she wanted to start a fight.
""He's cute,"" she said, nodding at the window.
""Too clean,"" I muttered.
""You like clean.""
""I like control.""
She smirked. ""You gonna f**k the cop or fight him?""
""Maybe both.""
She let out a low laugh. ""That's our girl.""
The girls filed out behind her, loaded with food and mouths full of noise. My family. My saucy sirens.
And behind them, through that glass, the golden boy was still watching.
We kicked our bikes into gear, tires squealing on pavement. My heart thrummed like a war drum as we peeled out of that lot. I didn't look back.
Didn't need to.
Because I knew he was still there.
Burning the sight of me into his memory.
And maybe I was doing the same.

Luke:
I couldn't get her out of my head.
She walked in like a thunderstorm dressed in leather and gasoline. And I sat there like a fool, a front-row seat to a show I had no business watching—but couldn't tear my eyes from.
SIREN-13.
That plate was burned into my brain like it had been branded there. Could've recited it in my sleep. Could've drawn it from memory. probably already had in the margins of my notepad. The kind of thing a rookie did. Not me.
But she wasn't just a plate number.
She was heat and smoke and eyes that didn't blink.
A walking warning label.
And I'd never wanted to ignore one more in my life.
We got back to the precinct in the early afternoon. Sun still high, city still angry. Rodriguez peeled off toward the vending machine like it owed him something, muttering about needing caffeine.
I told him I had paperwork.
Only half a lie. The parking ticket I was supposed to write up was still sitting in my cruiser's glove box, curled and stained from too many refills of bad coffee. It could wait. She couldn't.
I sat down at my desk, boots heavy on the linoleum, chair groaning beneath me like it knew something I didn't. I fired up the terminal. Old beast wheezed and flickered like it hated being asked to work. Same hum around me as always—phones, radios, someone in the back losing their s**t over the printer jam. White noise. Forgettable.
But my heart was too loud for any of it to register.
I opened the DMV database. Cursor blinking. Waiting.
I hesitated.
Not because I was scared. Because I wasn't supposed to want this much to know.
I typed it in.
SIREN-13.
Enter.
There she was.
Alexandra 'Alex' Donovan.
29.
Address tied to a converted garage on the edge of town—half biker hangout, half war zone. No current job listed. No license suspensions.
Affiliation flagged: suspected member of the Siren's Syndicates.
Bingo.
I scrolled. Assault. Disturbing the peace. Resisting arrest. All dropped. Charges that never stuck. Someone with friends—or someone who knew how to keep blood off her hands.
No convictions.
Not clean—but not dirty enough to touch.
And her photo...
Jesus Christ.
She wasn't smiling. Of course not. Her jaw was set like stone, lips a s***h of defiance, hair wild around her face like a lioness caught mid-prowl. Same ring on eyebrow—glinting in the DMV light like a secret dare.
I leaned back, rubbing my jaw.
She looked like she'd spit on rules just to watch them dissolve.
And I wanted to know how she got that way.
Why she wore defiance like perfume.
How someone could carry that kind of energy and not burn the world down.
She wasn't like the women I knew. She didn't preen. Didn't posture. She existed like a loaded gun—holstered, but always ready.
I clicked through to the MC's case file.
The Siren's Syndicates were a myth until a couple years ago. Some precincts still treated them like urban legends—like biker folklore. But not me. I saw them in flesh and chrome and red f*****g lipstick.
Women like her didn't follow rules.
They wrote new ones in blood.
Bar brawls. Chop shop fires. Smuggling rumors. Drugs? Maybe. Weapons? More likely. No ties to the cartel. Too messy. These girls ran their own s**t. All-female MC. No patch-sharing. No men. Just women who lived by their own creed.
Whispers of vigilante work, but nothing ever proven. A handful of victims with broken jaws and no comment.
I couldn't pin her down. That's what messing with me.
I'd spent my whole career profiling people. Putting them in boxes. Addict. Abuser. Victim. Liar.
But her?
She didn't fit any box.
She was the box.
And it was locked tight with a warning: Try me.
My phone buzzed.
I didn't answer.
I clicked through the notes. Nothing solid. Just theories and heat and missed chances. She'd slipped through fingers before—mine wouldn't be any different unless I played this smart.
""You working overtime, Jennings?""
Rodriguez's voice broke my focus.
I flipped the screen off. Too fast. Rookie move.
""Just finishing the report,"" I muttered.
He cracked open his soda. ""Sure. Looked like a DMV file.""
I shrugged. ""Needed to confirm a plate. Diner thing.""
He didn't push.
He knew the rules. What you don't ask, you don't have to lie about.
But my brain was still back at that diner, still hearing the gravel under her boots, still seeing the way she leaned on that bike like it was part of her spine. Confident. Controlled. Chaotic.
The kind of woman who'd ruin you—and you'd thank her for it.
Rodriguez started rambling again about Alyssa and some voodoo candle something. I nodded along, but I wasn't listening.
All I could think about was Alex Donovan and how she looked at me like I wasn't dangerous.
Like she was.
And she was right.
Because deep down, I wasn't the monster in this town.
But I was about to walk straight into one.
Later that night, I couldn't sleep.
Golden retriever soul, my god. Yeah, I smiled easy. Helped old ladies cross the street. Didn't like my eggs runny or my whiskey smoky. I was the guy your mom hoped you brought home. The good one.
But even golden retrievers have teeth.
And something about her made mine ache to get a taste.
I lay in bed, one arm flung over my eyes, the other still curled around my phone. That photo of her still burned behind my lids.
I wanted more than her name. I wanted her story.
Her scars.
Her soft spots—if she even had any.
And yeah, God help me, I wanted every inch of her body, too.
Tomorrow I'd drive past that address.
Just once.
Call it professional curiosity.
But I already knew better.
It wasn't professional.
And it wasn't going to be just once.",5,1750797806.0,romancenovels,5,1.0,False

I live EU (south) and wandering if anyone can suggest some beans you have tried.

I usually drink 2-3 espressos( 1 double espresso nothing added neither sugar nor milk and 1-2 iced ones also nothing added other than ice). so i’m looking probably for one with probably more acidity and not so nutty taste  (since i like it in the hot ones) and one with body so iced one won’t be too watery.

I (22M) am in this ethics seminar at my university and there’s this absolutely stunning girl in the class (I think she’s like 20F?). I’ll call her “Clare” because she honestly looks like she walked out of a 15th-century oil painting. Not in a bad way—like, she literally wears these long skirts and blouses and has her hair braided like some kind of Disney princess. I’m not even into religious girls but she’s next level ethereal.

Anyway, we’ve had some pretty intense debates in class (I'm an atheist, vegan, poly, pro-choice, anti-capitalist, etc.—you know, a *normal person*), and she always raises her hand and says stuff like “According to Aquinas...” or “That’s a disordered view of the human person.” Super articulate but...also super confusing?? I thought she was just really into the *vibe* of medieval philosophy or something, like an aesthetic.

So one day after class I finally build up the courage to talk to her. We were discussing virtue ethics so I figured it was the perfect segue. I make some lighthearted joke about how if Aristotle lived today he'd probably be a barista with a podcast, and she gives me this smile but it’s kind of...pitying? Like she’s laughing *at* me?

Still, I ask her if she wants to grab coffee sometime and she kind of shifts uncomfortably and says, “I don’t date.”

So I laugh and say, “Oh, same! I’m ethically non-monogamous too,” which I thought was a clever icebreaker, but then she gets this weird *concerned* look and says, “No, I mean I’m discerning marriage. I don’t date recreationally.”

Now, I’m not going to lie, I thought she was being pretentious. Like, who talks like that? So I say, “Well that’s kind of a weird purity culture thing, right? You know that’s rooted in patriarchal systems?”

And she just says calmly, “No, it’s rooted in natural law and the teachings of my faith,” and walks off.

So here’s where I might be TA. I was honestly a bit embarrassed. She totally shut me down in front of a few classmates, so later I posted this in our class group chat (which has like 40 people) saying something like: “PSA: if a girl says she’s ‘discerning marriage,’ she’s probably in a cult and thinks using condoms is a sin.” I added a laughing emoji to show it was a joke.

Well, it *did not* go over well. Clare left the chat (didn’t even say anything), and a couple other students DM’d me saying that was totally uncalled for and she’s just Catholic and I should educate myself.

But like—AITAH here? I honestly thought she was being ironic at first. I didn’t mean to be misogynistic or religiously intolerant or whatever, I just thought she needed to be called out for perpetuating some weird repression ideology in 2025.",0,1750797603.0,AITAH,13,0.2,False

This is a long and descriptive post; thanks in advance for reading through.

**Hello! Happy summer to current and future Bostonians!**

I am looking to fill a room plus in a large, three-bedroom house in Jamaica Plain, starting 9/1/25. I am also moving in at that time.

THE UNIT:

This is a very spacious, first floor three-bedroom with a full kitchen, pantry, dining room, living room, single bathroom, foyer, back porch, and shared yard. It will be rented directly from the owner, who is in the process of moving out. The space is roughly divided lengthwise, with one side being kitchen, dining, and living rooms, and other being a hallway with doors into the bedrooms. At the front of the house, there is the living room, which faces east towards the morning sun, the Arborway, and Arnold Arboretum beyond that. It contains five large windows and a non-working fireplace (can’t win ‘em all) with a mantle. Past the half-height, built-in bookshelves is the dining room, which also contains a china hutch with drawers and wainscoting. Next is the walk-through pantry, with cabinets, shelves, and drawers. The kitchen contains a stone peninsula, cabinets to the ceiling, gas stove with microwave above, full-size fridge, and dishwasher. On the other side of the house is the hallway, which has doors opening to three bedrooms, one small storage room, and a couple shallow closets. All bedrooms are on the left of the hallway, opposite living areas. In order, as you move down the hall, it goes bedroom, bathroom, and then two adjacent bedrooms. These last two bedrooms are what I am looking to fill, described more below. The bathroom is average size, with a combination tub/shower. At the back is a stairwell down to the basement, where this unit has its own, free washer and dryer. There is also a door to our small covered back porch, and then the large, fenced yard. This yard is mostly grass, but has room for gardening on the edges, and cobblestone patio area. I do not have any pets; to my knowledge, cats are allowed and dogs might be, but this would be a discussion with the owner (who I have quick access to).

THE HOUSE AND LOCATION:

This is a brick house, nearly 100 years old. It has been well-maintained, but while it has been jacked up and re-supported, the floors and trim have a charming tilt towards the center. It uses natural gas for heat. There are two upstairs units. The second floor, with the same large layout, will be occupied by my close friend and his roommate. The third floor attic unit is occupied by a couple that has lived there for some years. There is a driveway, but this will take some negotiation with other tenants, as it is not large enough for many cars. There is a -possibility- of renting a garage/storage space on the street behind, which opens into the backyard, but this will have to be negotiated with the owner. There is unrestricted parking on all adjacent streets, and while it is not abundant, I can typically park within a couple of blocks.

The location is directly across from Arnold Arboretum, near the main gate and information building. The Arborway goes south to Dorchester and beyond, and north to Brookline and the Fenway (and is an excellent, green, biking or walking corridor). Three blocks in the other direction is South Street, which contains delightful coffeeshops, community center, branch library, a bookstore, bike shop, basketball/pickleball courts, pet store, etc. South Street contains the 39 bus, which runs to Back Bay Station. A short walk up South Street is Centre Street, with many food and drink options, a pharmacy, markets, post office, and the like. About a 10 minute walk in one direction is the Orange Line at Forest Hills, and the Southwest Corridor Park bike path that goes through northern Roxbury, the South End, and Back Bay. 

THE ROOM(S) FOR RENT, AND TERMS:

I am looking to fill both of the back bedrooms. They both contain narrow closets, and while I don’t have dimensions or good pictures, would each easily accommodate a queen bed, dresser, etc. Ideally, I would like to rent to a person or couple that would use the third bedroom as a WFH office or similar. I am not looking to fill this house with people (the maximum would be three, including myself), but due to the abundance of shared living space, would like the other two bedrooms to get good use. I do not require more personal space than my own bedroom. I would also consider a tenant in each of the two available bedrooms, provided they have an existing relationship and connection to one another.

The total rent for the unit is $3500 per month. For a single person or couple that would like domain of both bedrooms, the rent breakdown would be \~57%/43%- $2000 for you, and $1500 for me. While $2000 is steep, it is only $1000 per private room, with ample shared space. If both bedrooms are rented separately, then the breakdown would be 33%/33%/33%, or approximately $1167 per month each. However, priority will be given to less tenants who want more space. Utilities would be split evenly between tenants, with transparency. I feel that this would be an ideal situation from someone who needs a home office or studio, and plenty of other space to share. I am not moving in a lot of furniture, so folks with a favorite couch, armchair, dining room table, etc are encouraged!

Regarding move-in costs, this is an excellent deal. Because I am working directly with the owner, there is **no broker fee. Move-in cost would only be one month rent (divided by us) and a half-month security deposit (divided by us).** The owner will commission a background/credit check on potential tenants, and the move-in cost would be collected after this, at lease signing.

ABOUT ME:

Hi! I’m a 40-year-old, cishet white guy, who has lived in this community for 20 years. My politics are distinctly leftist and intersectional, and consider myself an ally of all identities, though I’m still learning what that means. I have lived one block over for the last two years, and thus have relationships with many of the neighbors already. I work in construction, renovations, & maintenance, out of the house during typical weekday working hours. I also, seasonally, take on side jobs and other projects. My hobbies include playing and running Dungeons & Dragons games, skateboarding (mostly at the local skate bowl), attending live local music, bike rides, and trips out of town when possible. Thus, I’m not home a lot! When I am, I prefer a home that is tidy and functional for all involved. I am a little nerdy about my coffee setup, one of my few indulgences. I like guests, but appreciate some notice if anyone but tenants will be over; you can expect the same from me. I take pride in being considerate and sociable, though I do like some time alone.



Thank you for making it this far. If you are interested, please reach out with a description of yourself, how you would intend to use the other bedroom, and what you would like in your living space. I am happy to answer any questions, and can schedule viewings with the owner pretty easily.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# [🛒✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://336c1cn5k9u6xre6wkp8ai0t8m.hop.clickbank.net/)

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

# [🛒✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://336c1cn5k9u6xre6wkp8ai0t8m.hop.clickbank.net/)

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant

# 🔍 What is MITOLYN?

Before diving into my personal experience, let me give you a quick overview of what MITOLYN actually is.

**MITOLYN** is a powerful, science-backed dietary supplement designed to support **mitochondrial health**, energy production, cognitive function, and overall wellness. It’s packed with premium ingredients that help your body at the **cellular level**—something most supplements totally ignore.

I learned that as we age, our mitochondria (the energy factories inside our cells) start to deteriorate. This leads to fatigue, brain fog, slower metabolism, and even early signs of aging.

**MITOLYN is designed to reverse that process.**

# 💬 Why I Tried MITOLYN

I stumbled upon MITOLYN while searching for a real solution to my daily fatigue. I’m a busy working parent, juggling deadlines, meetings, and family life. No matter how much I slept or what I ate, I always felt **worn out by 2 PM**.

After trying other so-called ""natural"" supplements with zero results, I decided to give MITOLYN a shot—mainly because of the **raving customer reviews** and the fact that it’s based on **mitochondrial science**.

# 🔄 My Experience Using MITOLYN

I took MITOLYN exactly as directed—**2 capsules daily with water in the morning**. Within **a few days**, I started noticing a difference.

# [🛒✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://336c1cn5k9u6xre6wkp8ai0t8m.hop.clickbank.net/)

# ✅ Week 1:

* I didn’t feel the usual mid-day crash.
* I had more energy throughout the day.
* My sleep felt deeper and more refreshing.

# ✅ Week 2:

* My focus at work improved.
* I wasn’t reaching for coffee 3 times a day anymore.
* I felt **lighter, more positive, and in control.**

# ✅ Week 4:

By the end of the month, I was **functioning at a level I hadn’t experienced in years**. My mood stabilized, my energy levels were consistent, and I actually wanted to exercise again.

It felt like my body had hit a reset button.

# 🔬 What Makes MITOLYN Different?

# [🛒✅Visit The Official Website And Place Your Order For The Best Prices Available!](https://336c1cn5k9u6xre6wkp8ai0t8m.hop.clickbank.net/)

What truly sets MITOLYN apart from other supplements is its **formulation**. This isn’t a random blend of herbs—it’s a carefully crafted formula supported by science.

Here are just a few **powerful ingredients** I found listed:

* **CoQ10** – Essential for mitochondrial energy and heart health
* **Acetyl-L-Carnitine** – Boosts brain function and cellular energy
* **PQQ** – Helps generate new mitochondria
* **Alpha Lipoic Acid** – A potent antioxidant
* **Magnesium & B Vitamins** – For stress management and nervous system support

These are all **clinically proven ingredients** that actually support long-term health—not just mask symptoms.

|Overall Wellbeing|I felt ""younger"" inside and out|

# 🛡️ Is MITOLYN Safe?

As someone who’s always cautious about what I put in my body, safety was a top concern for me. Thankfully, **MITOLYN is made in an FDA-registered, GMP-certified facility** in the USA. It’s **non-GMO, gluten-free, and contains no artificial fillers**.

I’ve had **zero side effects**, and I feel confident knowing that what I’m taking is backed by both science and quality manufacturing.

# 💵 Is MITOLYN Worth the Price?

Honestly? **Every. Single. Penny.**

I’ve wasted money on ineffective supplements in the past, but MITOLYN has actually delivered real, visible results. The cost is **affordable for what you get**, and considering the long-term health benefits, it’s a no-brainer.

Plus, they offer **bulk order discounts**, which I now take advantage of so I never run out.

# 🎯 Final Verdict – Should You Try MITOLYN?

If you’re tired of:

* Constant fatigue
* Brain fog
* Stress and burnout
* Lack of motivation or focus

Then **MITOLYN is exactly what you need**. I recommend it 100%, and I only wish I’d discovered it sooner.

I've traveled. A lot. I am a self-admitted coffee connoisseur, a coffee aficionado, or I might even call myself a javaphile. Before I moved to Austin last November, I'd had coffee all over the world. Real coffee. Cappuccino or a late, for example, without added sugar. Not one of these sugared-up monstrosities that is a dessert in disguise pretending to be coffee, like a unicorn exploded in a coffee cup.

I've had coffee in Spain, Portugal, and Thailand. Hong Kong. Shanghai. The Philippines. Taiwan, France, and Italy. Belgium. The Netherlands. California, Mexico, and all around Asia and Europe. Africa. I have a coffee setup in my house that would rival some Starbucks.

***- by the way, don't drink Starbucks, friends don't let friends drink this swill. It t*****astes like regret with a splash of bankruptcy. A $7 reminder that price does not equal quality.""**

Bottom line: I just can't find a cup of coffee in Austin that doesn't taste like ash and broken dreams. Everything I've sampled in Austin tastes like someone dared a barista to make sadness drinkable. It's either too sour, watered down, and pale, or disguised with milk. More bitter than my ex and twice as expensive. I've tried ***Barretts, Spokesman, Bennu, Epoch, Meritt, Desnudo, and Terrible Love***. None of them rated higher than a 5/10 (a few were 2/10).

***Best Guess:*** A lot of people seem to feel that Olive Garden is good food, but having tried real Italian food in Rome and Venice, I feel that Olive Garden just tastes like disappointment...but with an elevated cost. In the same regard, my coffee palate might be similarly ruined by good coffee around the world.

Here's some of the good stuff in Madrid:

done both of course with medical advice from the doctor (so let me be clear this is in no way promoting at home detox without the proper medical treatment) and if you really need detox go obviously more so me ranting about how broken the system can be and of course I can always answer more questions. Today I’m day 1 sober 


Detox experience 


•food sucks I been to a few now unfortunately. It’s not nutritious. No hot breakfast at one place just cereal and granola bars and boiled eggs. (I swear I can’t even eat boiled eggs anymore because of that place 




•if it’s co-ed like the last one I went to you could end up with an abuser/stalker like i did. A lot of pimps, predators, abusers etc hang around 

Plus who seriously wants to be around the opposite sex when you are trying to heal and the last thing you care about is how you look. And you have no idea if someone is actually court ordered to be there which could become dangerous if you become friends 

-Or even better relapses with a friend you made in there when you get out. My last relapse started after he had a few on the counter and it turned into 20 more drinks a day for me. 

•no privacy can’t masturbate or sometimes even shower privately (some rooms don’t have locks on the door. People with no head phones or respect for others, snoring, talking loudly on their phone etc. 
some won’t even allow you to have a phone at all 

•rude staff like seriously act like it isn’t a paid job to be there and show a little compassion. Some of the staff I have met over the years are down right nasty. There’s always one or two with every place I been too.  

•some places won’t allow you to have coffee or tea or smoke. Or there’s no sugar at all for you to eat or drink. When you sober up your body craves sugar. Like why can’t they even have Gatorade or something 

I know it’s not supposed to be the ritz. But lord when you see a swarm of ants 🐜 attacking your crappy hospital food and staff giving attitude when you’re literally in the most possible vulnerable position ever it’s insane. 

If you miss a dose of your medication they literally won’t give it to you. Some places do. But most won’t. 


No air conditioner sweating in a hot room 
Uncomfortable beds. One thin pillow 
I have been in prison and I can tell you it’s very similar in a lot of ways.


I mean I’m sure there’s more I’m missing. I’m
Just grateful to be sober and not be in detox atm. Some places don’t even have meetings or make you attend them when you are still sick. 

Others won’t have any sort of entertainment. Helpful reading material.

* **Reliability** – Downtime = lost clients. No thanks.
* **Easy setup** – Because you’re busy coaching, not coding.
* **Scalability** – As your business grows, your hosting should too.
* **Affordability** – No need to break the bank before you’ve made it.

Hostinger checks all these boxes—and then some.

# Hostinger’s Features That Coaches Will Love

# 1. Crazy Affordable Pricing (More Money for Coffee… or Marketing)

Look, I get it. When you’re starting out, every penny counts. Hostinger’s **shared hosting starts at just $3.99/month**—that’s less than a fancy latte.

* **Single Plan** – Great for new coaches testing the waters.
* **Premium Plan** – More power for growing client lists.
* **Business Plan** – Best for coaches with online courses or heavy traffic.

And unlike some hosts (*cough* Bluehost *cough*), renewal prices don’t suddenly triple.

# 2. Stupid-Easy Website Builder (No Tech Skills Required)

If the thought of ""WordPress installation"" makes you sweat, relax. Hostinger’s **drag-and-drop builder** lets you create a pro-looking site in minutes.

* Pre-made templates (including sleek, coach-friendly designs)
* One-click WordPress install (if you want more control)
* No coding—just click, tweak, and launch

I once helped a life coach set up her site in under an hour. She was shocked. (So was I, honestly.)

# 3. Blazing-Fast Speeds (No More ""Buffering…"")

Ever tried watching a coaching video that keeps freezing? Yeah, your clients hate that too. Hostinger’s **LiteSpeed servers + SSD storage** mean your site loads faster than a client’s ""Aha!"" moment.

# 4. Free Domain & SSL (Because ""Not Secure"" Warnings Scare Clients Away)

A free domain for the first year? Check. **Free SSL encryption** so your site doesn’t get flagged as ""sketchy""? Double-check. Hostinger bundles these in, saving you time and money.

# 5. 24/7 Support (Because Tech Issues Don’t Care About Time Zones)

Picture this: It’s 11 PM, and your booking page crashes before a big launch. Hostinger’s **live chat support** has your back—no robots, just real humans who actually fix things.



# How Hostinger Stacks Up Against Other Hosts (Oops, Meant Hosts)

Let’s play ""Would You Rather"":

* **Bluehost**: Good but overpriced after Year 1.
* **SiteGround**: Solid, but their renewals hurt like a missed Zoom call.
* **GoDaddy**: Upsells you more than a timeshare presentation.

Hostinger? **Affordable, fast, and no-nonsense.** It’s the Swiss Army knife of hosting—gets the job done without the fluff.

# Setting Up Your Coaching Site with Hostinger (Step-by-Step)

1. **Pick a plan** (Premium is my go-to for coaches).
2. **Claim your free domain** (e.g., *TheConfidenceCoach.com*).
3. **Use the website builder or install WordPress** (your choice!).
4. **Add a booking plugin, testimonials, and a killer bio**.
5. **Launch and start attracting clients!**

Pro tip: Hostinger’s **tutorials** are like having a tech-savvy BFF on standby.

# Final Verdict: Hostinger is a No-Brainer for Coaches

In my (sometimes messy) experience, Hostinger is the perfect blend of affordability, ease, and performance. Whether you’re a solopreneur or running a group coaching empire, it scales with you—without the headaches.

1ljm38c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Austin/comments/1ljm38c/austin_coffeeblows/,Austin Coffee...blows!,"***TLDR:*** Austin Coffee blows, why can't I find a good coffee in this town?

I've traveled. A lot. I am a self-admitted coffee connoisseur, a coffee aficionado, or I might even call myself a javaphile. Before I moved to Austin last November, I'd had coffee all over the world. Real coffee. Cappuccino or a late, for example, without added sugar. Not one of these sugared-up monstrosities that is a dessert in disguise pretending to be coffee, like a unicorn exploded in a coffee cup. 

I've had coffee in Spain, Portugal, and Thailand. Hong Kong. Shanghai. The Philippines. Taiwan, France, and Italy. Belgium. The Netherlands. California, Mexico, and all around Asia and Europe. Africa. I have a coffee setup in my house that would rival some Starbucks. 

***- by the way, don't drink Starbucks, friends don't let friends drink this swill. It t*****astes like regret with a splash of bankruptcy. A $7 reminder that price does not equal quality.""**

Bottom line: I just can't find a cup of coffee in Austin that doesn't taste like ash and broken dreams. Everything I've sampled in Austin tastes like someone dared a barista to make sadness drinkable. It's either too sour, watered down, and pale, or disguised with milk. More bitter than my ex and twice as expensive. I've tried ***Barretts, Spokesman, Bennu, Epoch, Meritt, Desnudo, and Terrible Love***. None of them rated higher than a 5/10 (a few were 2/10). 

***Best Guess:*** A lot of people seem to feel that Olive Garden is good food, but having tried real Italian food in Rome and Venice, I feel that Olive Garden just tastes like disappointment...but with an elevated cost. In the same regard, my coffee palate might be similarly ruined by good coffee around the world. 

Here's some of the good stuff in Madrid:

1ljlx3z,https://i.redd.it/qxvaiav3px8f1.jpeg,Black Woman Afro Hair Transplant,"No one could have prepared me for the emotional rollercoaster I experienced over the last 2 weeks. I train 4/5 times a week, I go on a walk everyday and I have a busy day to day life so to have to pause all of that and also loose my hair which feels like a huge part of my identity? Oh. My. Goodness - Emotional rollercoaster. But my hair has been such an issue for me over the last couple of years that I know I needed to get it done. Hopefully it’s up from now but here a blow by blow of the journey so far. 


Day 1 - Arrive in Istanbul at 23.30. Exhausted. Luggage not lost ✔️, Instructions for the meeting point are clear ✔️✔️ Arrive at meeting point and wait for transfer for almost 30 mins. As I’m stood there I wonder - Hmm I wonder what everyone else is getting done. Get escorted to transfer. Thank God I’m the only one in this van. I couldn’t be asked with the small talk. Fuck, I forgot how far the airport is from Istanbul. 

Check in fine. Nice hotel, nice room. ✔️✔️


Day 2 - Have a small breakfast but instructions are not clear if I can actually have breakfast but they are leaning more towards that I should rather than I shouldn’t. Have something small anyway. Urgh, I can’t have a coffee or tea. 

Transfer is right on time 9.00 am sharp. Oh for goodness sake, 2 men in the van. Yes men, I’m a women having a hair transplant (I didn’t  say this out loud). 

Arrive at clinic. Received folder with blood-work. All okay, I don’t know why I was nervous but yeah it always does make me nervous. Glad they do the blood work though, it is bloody business and I’d rather them be safe than sorry. 

Ferried between, tricology pictures and face pics, drawing the hairlines. Pause at drawing the hairline. This is the important. No - too low. No -  too jagged. Get out chatGPT and translate exactly what you want. Still No - too round, no still to jagged. Tired of arguing - waiting area, sign contracts, make payment. 

Look at hairline on phone during all of ferrying about and asking myself is this ok. Not too low but not too high. Urgh - I don’t know, they do this all the time so they must be right. 

Time for transplant. Small room, clean, 3 technicians. Double check hairline. Me to the tech - Please make me look normal. I don’t want to look like a cartoon character, all the girls - don’t worry! Me - Ok, worried. New hairline is drawn on again. Head is completely shaved. Lots of tears from me. 

Anaesthetic comes in, and asks if I’ve eaten. I say yes, something small, his reply - very good. Explains that they’ll put me to sleep for 15 mins. Start anaesthesia, can remember falling asleep. Best sleep I’ve had in a while though. 

Wake up, they must have done all the local anaesthetic whilst I was asleep, can’t feel anything. Oh they’ve shaved my head again with razors. Ok baldy - you’ll just have to get used to this. Need a wee - (but really I’d like to se what they’ve done in the mirror). Urgh - they put a surgical bonnet on so I can’t see. Back to lying down - face down- fall asleep. Doctor comes in whilst I’m knocked out - vaugely remember - back to sleep. 

Woken up around between 11 and 12. All grafts have been harvested. Time for PRP and Regenera Activa. Time for transplant. 

In and out of sleep during transplant. Lunch around 12. Fuck this doesn’t look symmetrical at all. Heart sinks to the bottom of my stomach. WTF have I done. I know I shouldn’t have come to Turkey. Tears. 

3:30 ish. Transplant done. I’m upset. Representative explains all the medication. Not listening because I’m so disappointed. I can have coffee and go back to sleep normally in 7 days but it looks like gym is off the cards for 2 months. Wow, I’m going to be depressed. Get me home now. 

Back in the hotel. Order a nice dinner, fall asleep without trying. Flight is at 10am. 

Wake up 2300. Can’t get back to sleep. Transfer to clinic for first wash and finals check up is scheduled for 04:30. Fuck that’s early. Silly neck pillow. Trying hard to fall asleep again. Anxiety is setting in - Definitely won’t be getting some sleep. 

03.30am might as well get up, shower and pack. Check out 04.30am. Transfer is right on time. Thought to self - at least the service is impeccable. Can’t fault it. 

First wash done, saline spray given to me, more tablets given to me. Must google these before taking. Set off for the airport. 

Arrive at airport. Wow I feel so stupid. All the attendants keep querying me because I’m a bald black woman where the woman in the picture has great hair. I keep swearing and promising it’s me. Thank goodness I also have my driving licence. Stopped at the border control before the security lines. Stopped at the border control at the actual flight gate.

Oh the flight. Go to flight toilet. Check hairline. Hate it. It’s not symmetrical at all. Why the fuck did I do this. Oh shit now I’m bleeding. Urgh - does that mean a graft has dislodged. Fuck. I should have had this done in the UK. What a fucking idiot.  Sinking feeling. 

I hope automatic scanners in the UK recognise me. I hope automatic scanner sin the UK recognise me. I hope automatic scanners in the UK recognise me. I reallllly don’t want to have to take this bucket hat off in the crowds. 

The lines are slow, it’s hot. I need to get out if here. Scan me out. Yes. No need to take hat off. Waiting 50 mins for luggage. I really need to take this hat off now. Goes to the toilet to check head. Hairline not symmetrical. Why the fuck did I do this to myself. What an idiot. Sinking feeling. I can’t wait to get home. 

Transfer to collect car takes ages to arrives. I need to take this hat off. Please hurry up. Finally transfer arrives. Get in car, inspect hairline in rearview. Hate it. WTF have I don’t to myself. Checks emails. As luck would have it email from a UK clinic on the dangers of travelling to Turkey for a hair transplant. Urgh. It’s my own fault. I know better. Tears. Ok just drive home and look at the hairline properly in the mirror. 

Drive home. Spend an hour inspecting hairline in the mirror. Message clinic. Clinic tells me to be patient. Me and patience are like oil and water. Urgh hate it. Hate it. Hate it. I know better, why the fuck did I do this?! And it’s not as if I don’t have the money to have it done in the UK. Idiot. 

Kid comes home from school. Now they’re asking questions. I reassure them it’s not the big C. Fuck I do better. 


Day 3 - What a terrible fucking sleep. Who sleeps on their back ever in life. Put foam on head. Wash off. Put shampoo on. What do they mean tap/circular motions? How much pressure should I tap and circle with?  Forget to leave on for 3 mins. Wash off with shower head. Fuck not meant to do that. This is why I should have had it done in the UK. WTF have I done. Sinking feeling.  

Day 4 - Awful sleep. But it’s only another 3 days. You’ll be fine. Can’t be asked sitting in the house all day. Look like a puffer fish. WTF have I done. My forehead looks ridiculous. Anxiety. 

Day 5 - Awful sleep again. Neck pillows going to fucking choke me. WTF have I done. Full spiral into the online world of hair transplants. Why doesn’t anyone who looks like me or has my hair type post their journey. Urgh. WTF have I done. I’ve ruined my face. Tears. 

Day 6 - Horrible sleep. Necks aching. Back to work but I can’t face explaining to people that I can’t be on video. Face looks like a blowfish. Call in sick. Can’t do the school run. My kid thinks I have cancer. Whose fucking forehead is this, message the clinic multiple times to check if this is how it’s meant to be - fuck me they are slow at responding - WTF have I done. 

Day 7 - Horrible sleep. At least it’s the last day of using the neck pillow and my face isn’t that puffy anymore but fuck me im spiralling being in the house. Hairline still abnormal. WTF have I done. Hate this. Hate looking in the mirror. I’ve ruined my face. Why does my head still feel tender? 

Day 8 - Clinic responds. Neck pillow must be used until Day 10, they gave the wrong advise, no coffee or alcohol until day 10 either. Paperwork say different. Why I ask the clinic? The doctor updated the information to be safer. Me - well when was this update because I was there a week ago? Urrrggh. Cry cry cry. Still hate my hairline and now I’m fucking ITCHING. Fuck. 

Day 9 - Back to work today. I can’t stay off much longer. I’m spiralling. How do people not work?! Oh wait - the hairline actually looks decent, grafts are a bit spaced out but it feels like hair. Positive. And the hairline a looking good. Oh yay! Thank goodness for that. Now I’m excited to see what it will grow into. But Itchy, VERY ITCHY. 

Day 10 - COFFEEEEEEE! Thank fuck I needed that. Going into town, need a walk, some retail therapy and some vitamin D!

i am tired of what once was a way to meet other gay men is now a way to just judge each other. 

everything is casual- emotions are never to be discussed and the new normal is not normal. i truly don’t like the world we live in today. 

if you’re not having sex with a person they’ll find it elsewhere and if you’re having sex elsewhere you’re most likely involved with someone emotionally unavailable and/or just “casual”

i give up.

(Want your feedback!),"Hey everyone — I’m exploring a new concept and would love to get your honest take, not to pitch anything.

Recent reports show that **60% of manufacturers** are struggling badly to find maintenance techs. That’s:

* 1.5× more than machine operators
* 3× more than production, quality, or CDL drivers
* 10× more than roles like sales, marketing, or supply chain

With demand so strong, I want to know what *you* care about most in your daily work. Could you *rank* the following (1 = most important) based on your experience?

* 💰 **Pay**: Hourly, project rates, premium for certain certifications
* 🕒 **Flexibility**: Shifts, schedule, time off
* 🛠️ **Work type**: Preventive, repairs, installations
* 🔧 **Equipment**: Conveyors, mixers, ovens, packaging lines
* 🚗 **Commute or Location**: Travel distance, multiple sites, remote work
* 🧰 **Work Conditions**: Team size, tool access, safety, cleanliness

Feel free to drop your top 3–4 factors or rank all. Even a short comment helps—this is just a no-strings discussion to better understand what *actually matters* to techs.

Thanks in advance — I’m here to learn from your hands-on experience!

1ljlnkx,https://www.reddit.com/r/cripplingalcoholism/comments/1ljlnkx/chug_it_all_or_space_it_out/,"Chug it all, or space it out?","Here's my situation. I have absolutely no money until Friday afternoon. I mean, no money. I just spent the last of it on four fairly strong tall boys.

I am committed to visiting my elderly parents tomorrow, and normally this wouldn't be a problem, except my mother is. She scrutinizes me;  I made the deathly, fatal mistake of telling my parents several years ago that I thought I had an alcohol problem, and now I'm always under a microscope. They drink to their hearts content, but God help me if I show up looking anything less than incredible, claiming sobriety. They believe I'm sober, because I am not allowed to have a problem with alcohol.. She looks me up and down, she asks me about my drinking, but she's sitting there with her white wine in a portable coffee cup like she's fooling anyone. She's had three falls in the last 2 years. But I'm the one with the problem.

I have three 1 mg ativans, a few Gabapentin, and three tall boys left to my name. My anxiety is through the roof for numerous reasons, and I absolutely cannot cancel out on this visit. Do I slam them back and then go for the medication? Do I Pace them out and then...then what?

Normally in this situation I would just make do and probably take myself to the S
ER or have it out here by myself with the few pills I have. Not an option. As it is, I'm very scared about the limited alcohol I have.

It's almost liberating to have no money, because I have been in such a massive state of depression over circumstances this month that all of my savings went to drinking. But then I have this family visit.",0,1750795962.0,cripplingalcoholism,9,0.5,False

Bosses son ruins my job b/c I wouldn't sleep with him. He's sleeping with my manager, and so is his dad.","This one is very messy, so buckle up.

I began working at a law firm in San Diego a few years ago. The bosses son, who is an attorney, took me to lunch one day. He told me he is polyamorous and wanted to add me to his roster. I said no, I was/am uninterested. He said we should be ""work friends"", and his dad was the boss, so I said sure, plutonic work friends.

He texted me regularly asking me to go to his office, and would stop by my office to flirt. I began putting my phone in DND all day and making excuses to avoid spending much time with him. Sometimes he would insist I go to lunch or coffee with him. He began sleeping with my manager and things changed. He began talking down to me and convinced my manager to bully, harass, intimidate, stalk (in and outside of work), and create a hostile work environment for me.

While she was sleeping with him and bullying me, she also began sleeping with 3 old men at the office, all with corner offices. One of them is the guys dad. To add, son and father share a name.

I finally confronted this guy privately and told him what I experienced as a result of being his ""work friend."" During this conversation, he brought up his suspicions that this girl was sleeping with his dad. I told him I stay at the office late and she routinely stayed late night in his dad's office. He cried in front of me because of it. None of it stopped after I confronted him. It got worse.

I had to go fully remote to get away from the constant harassment from my manager. I was secluded from my peers. I was given the lowest raises possible with outstanding work performance.

I know I should let this go, but I don't want to. I want to get him back in the harshest way I can think of. I want to connect with his mom and tell her everything her husband and son do when they're at work. Why her husband stays at work so late. I want revenge for how they treated me.
