1ot403n,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1ot403n/best_friends_with_a_girl_with_a_bf_who_ive/,Best friends with a girl with a BF who I've confessed feelings for,"**TL;DR:** I (M, mid-20s) confessed feelings to my friend ""K"" (F, mid-20s) who has a long-distance boyfriend. We tried to stay friends, but the chemistry and flirting only escalated. She now gets ""cranky"" and acts like a jealous girlfriend when I distance myself or don't meet her expectations, but refuses to address her relationship or her feelings for me. I’m exhausted and need clarity.

K and I met at work two years ago. The chemistry was instant and intense; everyone noticed it. We used to spend a ton of time together—pool, coffee, long talks. A year ago, she moved cities and during that time, casually posted a picture with her LDR boyfriend. We were all shocked because she had never mentioned him.

When she returned, the chemistry was still there, maybe even stronger. Our mutual friends constantly commented on how well we fit together. Things got incredibly flirtatious. We’d hang out late at her place playing Switch, having deep talks, and doing karaoke.

# The First Confession and Fallout

Earlier this year, the guilt of having these feelings for an unavailable person became too much. I was obsessed. I confessed that I really liked her, but out of respect for her boyfriend, I needed us to stop talking, and I left.

She pulled me back, asked when I started feeling this way, and confirmed she greatly valued my friendship, not wanting to lose it. She never reciprocated my feelings, but I felt relief just having said it. I agreed to take a short break, thinking I was over it. Later, she reached out to my female best friend, confused, asking why I confessed if I was immediately ""over"" the feelings.

**A Crucial Personality Trait:** K is highly non-confrontational. She won't address problems; she lets them simmer until the breaking point before acting. I believe this is key to everything she's doing.

# The Vacation and The Second Fallout

A couple of months later, we went on a group vacation. Due to travel issues, K and I were alone for the first day. We had a great time—amusement park, drinks, very flirtatious energy.

The next night, I was drunk, but I distinctly remember her moving closer, letting her hand linger against mine, and even pressing her hip against my arm. We were smiling and flirting intensely. However, when our other friends started noticing and whispering about us ""going at it again,"" K visibly stiffened up and became distant.

The next morning, she was cold. Later, I found out she had told the group that she **only** sees me as a friend and claimed I had misinterpreted our first solo day as a ""date."" I felt  disrespected, cut her off completely at work, and ignored her.

Eventually, a good friend convinced me to talk to her, saying she was genuinely sad. We patched things up, agreeing to remain strictly friends. At this point, I truly thought my romantic feelings were gone.

# The Current, Confusing Dynamic

Fast forward a few months to now. We're texting more than ever, growing a deep, intimate connection. We joke about me being her ""favorite"" and her knowing I asked her out. She brings it up very often and laughs about the situation. The flirtation has returned, though physical contact is limited to playful punches and kicks. When it's just us talking, she get's very excited and tries to play around with me in a way my ex used to lol

Recently, she sent me a picture of her Halloween costume (not posted publicly, which I thought was slightly weird and out there) and seemed upset when I didn't come see her at a bar because I was hanging out with my friends. For two days, she was short, cranky, and used typical ""girlfriend"" one-word responses (""fine,"" ""i'm always the problem,"" ""whatever""). When I finally saw her the next day, she couldn't stop smiling and admitted, ""I can do whatever I want :P, I always get what I want.""

She admitted that she always tells me the truth, but **""hides"" details** because they aren't ""necessary"" for me to know. When I ask her to be explicit about what she wants, she gives cryptic answers like: ""if you know you know but you dont know...""

No one texts their best friend this much; I know everything about her life, except her actual relationship. She keeps hinting that something is bothering her but she is unwilling to make a change, putting it off until the ""breaking point."" Last night she mentioned that she will deal with it early next year, because she has a lot of things going on in life right now (fair)

We are planning to get coffee this week to work together, and I am leaning back into the infatuation loop.

1. Does she actually like me romantically, or is she just addicted to the attention and emotional intimacy?
2. Is she using me as a backup, keeping me close so that when she hits her LDR ""breaking point,"" she has a soft landing?

I know this dynamic is wrong and draining. I want to start seeing other people, but I can't shake the feeling she might be ""the one"" if she were only available. I'm struggling to pull away because the moment I do, she senses it and flips into this needy, girlfriend-like persona to reel me back in. I feel like I value her as a friend a lot, but there is no reality in which we can continue the same way.

I, 35M, was catching the train home from work 2 months ago or so. Minding my own business but ended up, due to some nutters on the train, striking up some nice conversation with two ladies for about 20 minutes. They got off and I wished them a good afternoon.

That night I got a match on an app out of nowhere and it was one of those ladies. She sent two messages about how it was nice to chat and what are the odds of finding me on there…. Then she stopped replying. After two weeks she unmatched me. I assumed that was the end of it.

Turns out we go to the same gym, and it was quite awkward whenever she saw me. At first she would pretend not to see me, and I didn’t want things to be awkward for her so I kept away.  The other night I was at the gym, walked past and she looked over at me and I waved, said hi so as not to be awkward. She waved and said hi back and I carried on my way.

The following night I was at the gym again, doing my own thing and she came up and asked for my number/socials and if I would like to go for coffee with her. I gave her the benefit of the doubt and she added me on FB. we had a chat for ten or so and went on our way. She mentioned that she got overwhelmed by the app and deleted it - which I understand completely.

I messaged her that night. That was 3 nights ago and she hasn’t even bothered opening my message….i figure she has just flaked out on me again.

1ot3wu7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Globelore/comments/1ot3wu7/the_sakes_lore_drop/,The Sakes lore drop.,"Just occurred to me that I never FULLY explained what the Sakes are. So here’s a bit of an update I presume.😉⬇️


The sakes are “gods” from far away lands (Valeria, where captain Torus is from. Speaking of have any of you met him?) which were more like prophets. Or messengers. And or some are philosophers. Here’s the REAL juicy stuff below.

The day the ground became sky: one of the Sakes prophecies was that there was a leviathan (also, quick note, THIS IS IN NO WAY RELATED TO THE NORTH SEA LEVIATHAN EVENT!!) lying deep inside the planet of Arctus, and one day… it would be unleashed. Only one who lost everything, but rose from the ashes would be able to defeat it. And luckily that description fit Borgs pretty well! When the day came, all citizens were issued to evacuate. As scientists had seen the signs of the leviathan rising from the sea before anyone else. All citizens were issued to move to Geniseo, Borglin eventually started noticing the signs the Sakes prophesied about and became REALLY disbanded from the group. (King Pinkney, Milton, F.J.) so when a fallen knight came to their doorstep, Borglin knew it was one of the Sakes predictions. Calling it “the first sign”. Then he could feel the leviathan rising from Gensiseo. That’s when all but Milton were still there. So when Borglin knew what he had to do, was go back to Urbis, he told Milton but it was too late… a tentacle was arising. Debris fell from the tentacle and Borglin knew he had to act quick. He quickly thought of an answer and told Milton to follow him to the Alkh. Where he knew Manny was, and his handy dandy “how to kill a leviathan” book was. Borg told Milton while both were rushing frantically to the Alkh his plan. He needed support from the Navy and Air Force of Urbis. He dived down and rolled (he tripped) he found Mannny and told him to help! Manny being the dumbo with no brain he is did. Manny told them to change into uniforms, only having a brain when it comes to fashion. So he ran into the Great Cavern and got prayed for guidance from the Sakes. The only guidance they gave was how to put on the uniform because he hit some power rangers type shiz and had it on when he opened his eyes. All three of them rushed back, Milton was in charge of the Air Force, Borglin was on Navy duty. So when the leviathan broke free from the ground and attacked every last one of the ships, Borglin yelled for help from Milton. Little did he know all his air-ships had been taken out. And Milton was now free falling into Borglins conveniently placed arms. Borglin dived into the water and took out Revolvie, knowing where a weak spot was. But to no avail as a tentacle grabbed him and threw him back on the ship causing it to almost lose balence! He gave Revolvie to Milton and told him that he was the only one small enough to reach it. And sure enough. He did, he shot Revolvie and the bullet was send flying to heart of the leviathan! It fell causing a slight “big wave”. Borglin and Milton walked away, and Borgs lowk got some coffee and read the daily gossip news and fell asleep after doing so.

But here’s the thing. A lot of people want to be smarter, calmer, sharper, but underestimate how powerful consistent reading is. Especially in a content-overloaded world where everyone’s glued to shorts or reels explaining “how to be successful in 10 seconds.” 

Reading daily is not just a flex. It literally changes your brain, your ability to think, and how you process reality. But no one talks about the before and after effect. Everyone’s selling you hacks. Or worse, random motivational quotes with zero substance. 

This post is a breakdown of everything I’ve learned about reading every day, from neuroscientists, podcast interviews, bestselling books, actual data. Not influencer BS. If you feel overwhelmed, distracted, lost in your head, or just tired of being 25 tabs deep and still feeling dumb, this is for you.

First, some straight-up neuroscience. Reading activates your default mode network, which is tied to memory, self-reflection, and imagination. According to a study from Emory University, focused reading increases brain connectivity, especially in the somatosensory cortex. Meaning? You literally start to experience what characters feel. The more absorbed you are, the more your brain wires for empathy and focus. 

This is also echoed by Dr. Maryanne Wolf in her book *Reader, Come Home*, where she warns that digital skimming is changing the way we think. “We’re losing the cognitive patience needed for deep reading,” she says. And that’s huge. Because before daily reading, your attention span is scattered. You absorb less. You default to reaction instead of reflection. After? You start getting actual clarity. You can go deep. You start forming opinions instead of just repeating stuff you saw on X or Reddit.

James Clear, author of *Atomic Habits*, explains it perfectly in a Huberman Lab podcast (ep. 34): Reading is a habit that compounds. The more you do it, the easier it gets to pick up another book. But before you build this habit, your brain resists. There’s friction. Everything feels like a chore. That’s because you haven’t trained your mind to enjoy long-form input. But this friction isn’t your fault. Social media literally hijacks your dopamine system. A BBC report in 2023 showed that our average attention span dropped to 47 seconds per task. That’s shorter than a YouTube ad.

The fix starts with making reading not feel like effort. Create frictionless triggers. Stack it with coffee. Keep one book in your bag. Pick books that actually match your curiosity, not just what everyone else is reading. When it becomes a craving, not a task, your whole mindset shifts. Suddenly you’re viewing the world through ideas, not hot takes.

One book that flipped my entire mental operating system was **The Psychology of Money** by Morgan Housel. It’s not just about personal finance, it’s about how we make decisions, how emotions influence behavior, and why being smart doesn’t mean you’ll be wise. This book will make you question everything you think you know about success. It’s basically the best life-strategy book disguised as a finance book. Housel writes like a philosopher with receipts, every insight backed by behavior science and real case studies.

Another insane read is **Stolen Focus** by Johann Hari. This book isn’t just doomscroll propaganda. It dives deep into why our brains are breaking, attention-wise, and how tech, school systems, and even food play into it. It’s like a crash course in reclaiming your mind. It’s a bit rage-inducing, but that’s also why it’s so powerful. You finish it and go, “Okay I need to change something now.”

For something that hits emotionally and intellectually, try **Man’s Search for Meaning** by Viktor Frankl. It’s read by CEOs, therapists, athletes, everyone. Frankl, a Holocaust survivor and psychiatrist, explains how humans can endure anything if they have meaning. This isn’t some spiritual fluff. It’s raw, real, and reshapes how you see suffering and purpose. If you’ve been feeling lost or numb, this book will punch you in the soul in the best way. Best existential read I’ve ever touched.

If you’re someone who prefers audio, the **Lex Fridman Podcast** is like having deep convos with the brightest minds alive. His interviews with Sam Altman, Ray Dalio, and Balaji Srinivasan are insane knowledge dumps. Not just about tech, but how power, innovation, and decision-making actually work. Listen to one episode per walk and you’ll feel like you’ve taken a course in futurism by the end of the week.

If you want bite-sized psychology that hits hard, check out **The Psychology of Your 20s** podcast by Jemma Sbeg. She breaks down the mess of modern adulthood without sounding like a condescending therapist. Super easy to binge, especially on those “getting my life together” mornings.

To make reading and learning actually stick, apps help. Start with **Fable**. It’s a beautifully designed social reading app that lets you join book clubs, discuss chapters, and track your reading in a way that feels more fun than productive. It also curates picks from people like LeVar Burton, Emma Roberts, and even therapists. It makes reading feel less lonely if none of your friends read.

Then there’s **BeFreed**, arguably the most advanced AI-powered study partner out right now. Built by a research team from Columbia University, it turns books, expert talks, and real-world case studies into podcast-style lessons tailored to your goals. You can choose how deep you want to go, 10, 20, or 40 minute sessions, and even pick your host’s vibe. Mine has this lowkey sarcastic voice that makes serious topics actually entertaining. But the best part is how it gets smarter the more you use it. It learns what you’re curious about, tracks what you’ve “studied,” and builds a personalized learning roadmap over time. It also already includes insights from all the books I recommended above, which is wild. If reading feels overwhelming, this app pretty much removes every excuse you could have.

Before daily reading, your mind is reactive. You chase dopamine. You forget what you consume. You scroll all day but nothing sticks. After daily reading? You start seeing patterns. You build mental models. You respond instead of react. It’s not hype. It’s literally how your brain rewires itself. That’s why the difference is unreal.",1,1762746690.0,AtlasBookClub,0,1.0,False

My last post seemed to be a little vague for the rest of you, and the issue at matter was forums business practice and lack of people skills. It’s shown that the owners are NOT good people at all. That being said, they are very cocky, people who work for them are just pawns. And I know that after watching how they discard their baristas over nothing. After I had been fired from my job (pretty much over the smallest conversation with the owner and dumping some spoiled milk), I reported them to the health department, later on they found out my best friend (who worked there before me, I got the job to work with her) was fired for knowing, though has been brought to my attention they threw out names in the gutter spewing lies about us to our old colleagues. Though my friend knew, it was all me and they told people they fired her for “aiding” the investigation which is in violation of the whistle blower act. They had them posted on the walls in the back room and funny enough removed it after tossing her to the curb. The environment was fun at times, I very much loved working in coffee and sometimes the owners were appreciative, but the longer you stay the more you understand why the turnover is so large. His father also made work uncomfortable, though he was kind at times, him and his friends would always talk inappropriately about immigrants/poc which i found very inappropriate and uncomfortable as many of our customers/workers were poc…Many people had been fired and quit within my first 3-4 weeks of working there. Our safety is not cared for and we are talked down to a lot. But honestly you should see how he’s responded to some negative reviews, there was once a time where a customer left a negative review on the Livingston location on how the quiche made the customer and her child sick. The owner then went back to GASLIGHT them and say they had a virus like “every other kid this week” (something very close to that the review is still up) and say she “blackmailed them.” For wanting a refund.  There is so much more I can post but it’s a lot and I don’t want to violate any other rules here. I posted a few TikTok’s with ss from group chats photos of spoiled goods we served and spoiled milk at the end of my shifts etc, and after that the owner sent a cease and desist to MY FATHER. Harassing my family instead of me is shameful. I’m not going to be quiet or silenced because of everything behind the scenes. Anyways all, I hope this gives you more knowledge and I thank you for reading💚 but I obviously won’t be posting about this further here because I don’t want to spam and I’m trying to stay within the rules.

I am seriously looking forward to it because it feels like my “reign of terror” is coming to an end. That being said I do have a serious question. Due to my alien babies being roughly the size of a real babies head, I will be having the “c-section” surgery. I will stay in the hospital 1-2 days. That being said I am looking to recover alone. That leads me to my questions. 

Other than get help, what advice would you offer someone in my position? 

I have a recliner and plan on sleeping in there until I can sleep in my bed again. 

I have a rather large dog.. my original plan fell through due to the this happening over the holiday season. Right now I am planning to board him or using Rover and hoping for the best. If I board him, how long would you recommend to board him? 

It’ll be winter so I plan to do mostly soups and tv dinners. I plan to give up coffee just for a moment. (I will drink coffee as way to deal with my feelings.. it’s a whole, I’m in therapy BUT! coffee (and Jesus) is the elixir of life. I digress) I really want to succeed in doing this alone so any suggestions on how I can prepare on the front in will be greatly appreciated! ",1,1762746571.0,Fibroids,0,1.0,False
1ot3qjp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ot3qjp/confused_about_how_to_proceed_with_a_tricky/,Confused about how to proceed with a tricky situation,"**TL;DR:** I (M, mid-20s) confessed feelings to my friend ""K"" (F, mid-20s) who has a long-distance boyfriend. We tried to stay friends, but the chemistry and flirting only escalated. She now gets ""cranky"" and acts like a jealous girlfriend when I distance myself or don't meet her expectations, but refuses to address her relationship or her feelings for me. I’m exhausted and need clarity.

K and I met at work two years ago. The chemistry was instant and intense; everyone noticed it. We used to spend a ton of time together—pool, coffee, long talks. A year ago, she moved cities and during that time, casually posted a picture with her LDR boyfriend. We were all shocked because she had never mentioned him.

When she returned, the chemistry was still there, maybe even stronger. Our mutual friends constantly commented on how well we fit together. Things got incredibly flirtatious. We’d hang out late at her place playing Switch, having deep talks, and doing karaoke.

# The First Confession and Fallout

Earlier this year, the guilt of having these feelings for an unavailable person became too much. I was obsessed. I confessed that I really liked her, but out of respect for her boyfriend, I needed us to stop talking, and I left.

She pulled me back, asked when I started feeling this way, and confirmed she greatly valued my friendship, not wanting to lose it. She never reciprocated my feelings, but I felt relief just having said it. I agreed to take a short break, thinking I was over it. Later, she reached out to my female best friend, confused, asking why I confessed if I was immediately ""over"" the feelings.

**A Crucial Personality Trait:** K is highly non-confrontational. She won't address problems; she lets them simmer until the breaking point before acting. I believe this is key to everything she's doing.

# The Vacation and The Second Fallout

A couple of months later, we went on a group vacation. Due to travel issues, K and I were alone for the first day. We had a great time—amusement park, drinks, very flirtatious energy.

The next night, I was drunk, but I distinctly remember her moving closer, letting her hand linger against mine, and even pressing her hip against my arm. We were smiling and flirting intensely. However, when our other friends started noticing and whispering about us ""going at it again,"" K visibly stiffened up and became distant.

The next morning, she was cold. Later, I found out she had told the group that she **only** sees me as a friend and claimed I had misinterpreted our first solo day as a ""date."" I felt  disrespected, cut her off completely at work, and ignored her.

Eventually, a good friend convinced me to talk to her, saying she was genuinely sad. We patched things up, agreeing to remain strictly friends. At this point, I truly thought my romantic feelings were gone.

# The Current, Confusing Dynamic

Fast forward a few months to now. We're texting more than ever, growing a deep, intimate connection. We joke about me being her ""favorite"" and her knowing I asked her out. She brings it up very often and laughs about the situation. The flirtation has returned, though physical contact is limited to playful punches and kicks. When it's just us talking, she get's very excited and tries to play around with me in a way my ex used to lol

Recently, she sent me a picture of her Halloween costume (not posted publicly, which I thought was slightly weird and out there) and seemed upset when I didn't come see her at a bar because I was hanging out with my friends. For two days, she was short, cranky, and used typical ""girlfriend"" one-word responses (""fine,"" ""i'm always the problem,"" ""whatever""). When I finally saw her the next day, she couldn't stop smiling and admitted, ""I can do whatever I want :P, I always get what I want.""

She admitted that she always tells me the truth, but **""hides"" details** because they aren't ""necessary"" for me to know. When I ask her to be explicit about what she wants, she gives cryptic answers like: ""if you know you know but you dont know...""

No one texts their best friend this much; I know everything about her life, except her actual relationship. She keeps hinting that something is bothering her but she is unwilling to make a change, putting it off until the ""breaking point."" Last night she mentioned that she will deal with it early next year, because she has a lot of things going on in life right now (fair)

We are planning to get coffee this week to work together, and I am leaning back into the infatuation loop.

1. Does she actually like me romantically, or is she just addicted to the attention and emotional intimacy?
2. Is she using me as a backup, keeping me close so that when she hits her LDR ""breaking point,"" she has a soft landing?

I know this dynamic is wrong and draining. I want to start seeing other people, but I can't shake the feeling she might be ""the one"" if she were only available. I'm struggling to pull away because the moment I do, she senses it and flips into this needy, girlfriend-like persona to reel me back in. I feel like I value her as a friend a lot, but there is no reality in which we can continue the same way.

“Log #1999, The final experiment is upon me.. The goal to achieve The Golden Butterfly, a species that can erase chaos from any land in hopes of Tracen to become normal once more.”

I'm not one to believe in luck, but please.. Let me do one successful thing as a genius, I'll prove myself and everyone that I am a successful inventor! 

“My hands are shaking too much, my legs seem to be trembling, and my heart seems to be beating too fast.. I'm nervous aren't I?. No, the experiment has yet to start”

*I.. Take a deep breath as I grab the cage of a single chaos butterfly.*

“.. Once more, we meet again, this time you're the most dangerous you could be.. Even one flutter of your wings would make any normal person go into a psychotic episode.”

... I'm way too lightheaded, but I have to continue on, my hands and feet feel numb by the sheer aura of this one, I **HAVE** to proceed.

*The Chaos Butterfly had attempted to fly off, though I was able to quickly restrain it, my fingernails were already decaying by the mere touch.*

“Tsk, given my fingernails decaying.. I only have about five minutes to complete the experiment, this next step is to configure the chaotic energy and switch it by using fragments from The Seed of Light (SoL) in order to shape the butterfly into the enbodiment and bringer of peace, prosperity and hope.”

The butterfly briefly escaped from its restraint as it tried flying, the cage turned into dust near instantly, my heart spiked at the very moment.

“Damnit- I have to hold it down before it causes any further harm, but my hands would be at a risk.. But as they say, *Fuck it, we ball*”

My hands were instantly getting even more numb, only my sheer willpower was able to get even the fingers to start moving, my fingertips turned purple from lack of oxygen. Though, 

“My left hand.. The veins have bursted and it has experienced nerve damage, only two minutes until it's gone, and only two minutes to complete the experiment.”

The core of the butterfly was able to be seen, my eyes were instantly corrupted upon the sight as constant hallucinations appeared, my breathing became rapid as I attempted to a piece of the seed of light.

“*Cough*, only 30 seconds until I am engulfed by the butterfly’s aura, all that's left is to reconfigure the chaotic energy and shape the butterfly into one that shines hope.*

My right hand tries desperately to complete the procedure before it's too late.. But it cracked, as if it was made out of clay, my fingers were falling out, my eyes widened in fear.

“Wh-what? This can't happen, did I fail?! Sh*t, I've only got 15 seconds before-”

My will shattered, as the chaos butterfly engulfed the piece of the seed of light, its wings became elongated, its body turned a grotesque shape, it completely covered the light of my room as it produced smaller, more “hungry"" offsprings, and used them to insert its chaotic energy upon every single vein of my body.

The offspring turned a beautiful blue, I wouldn't expect it to be originally a species that ended cities. Its only then did the mother butterfly spared me light, what was hope, burnt my body as if I was some vampire.

“I.. I've failed, my body has been sacrificed, my will has been broken.. But, I don't want to die.. I'm afraid of dying even, but I won't die pathetically, I-”

My right eye has died as my left was slowly crumbling, I no longer can see, the beautiful colours of the world became only but a pipedream. The words on my books has became useless, my work, had turned into nothing but paper for me.. The reason I lived, was useless, my dreams were shattered, a door opened as a womans voice appeared.

“A-Asaru, is that you? I-I'm sorry, I shouldve listened and stopped when I could, I'm.. I'm so sorry, all I want is to see your face one more time.. Brush Yanami’s fur for the last time, make stupid inventions that gave you a smile everytime it failed.”

My hope didn't last long, it wasn't her.. My vision regenerated for a moment as if she wanted me to see who she was. A lab coat, long brown hair, red eyes.. My instincts told me, she was the only way for me to achieve my goals, my dreams.

I've lost all meaning, this voice is the only way for me to find my meaning once more, why shouldnt I follow it? Otherwise, I'll only be a dead husk, a failure of an inventor..  The voice asked “What do you think of yourself, X?

What am I? An inventor that failed despite being a genius?.. The man selfish enough to risk his life to complete his goals?.. I left them, I've left my friends, I, who left everyone, who left Asaru, who left Yanami.. Am I even considered human?.. Is **he** even considered human?.. I answered: “An ugly, arrogant, non-graceful butterfly lucky enough they weren't a moth.”

... I was the perfect inventor, I wasted my life on making uselessness because my predecessor did, I wasted my only talent, the thing that made me unique because I was born- no, made to.. I no longer saw myself, X, to be human. I wanted to punish myself for my selfish actions. 

o“If you wish to, the choice is yours.”

I'm not one to be indecisive, but I subconsciously pulled back from my own decision, I thought “But, if I truly went on this path.. I'd hurt them more already.” My final selfless act, I declined.. The last of my will was used as the voice gradually disappeared.. Leaving me to die bleeding in my own room.

“Wh-why did I decline.. I've lost my only chance to prove myself again, but I declined because I thought of others.”

Gradually, my senses disappeared, the blood inside my mouth was nothing, the smell of my corpse was too, my skin could no longer feel, finally, both of my eyes were dead, the beauty of the world was no longer mine to bear, but it was deserved.. 

My ears though, they still worked, the last they could hear was the sound of running, purrs, and crying.. Until it was gone.

****X was Dead.**** His curiosity amongst those three sounds were never to be answered, as if death mocked him.. Countless books and pages fell across the room as many inventions ceased to work such as the infinite coffee dispenser no longer dispensing, but he had one last thing to remember.

“My seven minutes huh.. Only three weeks of being here, and it's all about those goofballs, getting a new kitten, being kidnapped, going on a walk with a friend and going to their garden to get flowers, I.. Used those flowers to make a gift for a woman, they must mean alot to me, but I've forgotten everything. Finally, her laugh.”

This seemed to be an amazing life, wasn't it? But I no longer can experience that life, but X can, my final invention, I've realized that there was an unlimited amount of universes, thus, so many X’s that haven't been used.

“my last selfless act, I'm no longer X, but someone else is, to live my uncompleted life and finish what I've left is their task.. By switching my consciousness and giving my body to someone else, they'll keep X functional enough for him to survive these injuries.. But I'll no longer exist, that is my consequence, I accept.”

“X"" has been resurrected, but the one we knew is no longer.. A final conversation was made between the two.

“What am I? What is my name? And who are you?”

*My name is X, you are a successor to complete my legacy, but ultimately to become a better version of myself, I require you to be closer with others, to be less arrogant, to be friendly to everyone.*

“... I see, X, thank you for giving me this chance to survive, to live once more, I promise to succeed in your name.. But what is mine?”

*You are Xenagoras, a foreign, strange assembly made by the former X. Now go on, succeed in my name, and be the best version of me in yours.*

“Wh-WAIT! I still have questions-”

When I woke up, my body is bleeding, my hands seems to be broken from physical damage?.. I have to find a hospital, an infirmary! But I don't know where I am.. 

“I NEED A DOCTOR! PLEASE! I’M GOING TO DIE!”

My legs were broken, though my willpower was strong, I crawled with all I had and fell from a tree into what looks like an academy, but the fall turned me unconscious, all I can do is wish for someone to find me. 

**The End**

(Thanks for reading! This is the end of X’s story, now on this account will get deleted after this is posted.. But, this isn't a permanent goodbye, atleast for Xenagoras. As they say, a farewell is useless if we’re just gonna meet again! So don't start missing me already!.. But for now, goodbye!)",3,1762746472.0,Umaddit,4,1.0,False

I was in >!city-in-middle-east!< visiting my uncle with my mom and siblings. I didnt want to go but my dad forced me, dad wasnt with us though.

And my uncle was so welcoming and let us sleep in the guest room and would talk to us alot, he'd also be so kind to my little siblings and show interest with their hobbies and their drawings, and would also teach them about the questions they ask of life

And when me and him were talking the subject came to hospitality, he said ""ofcourse you're welcome! You're my nephews and i *must* welcome you""

""I just must welcome everyone you know? Not just because they're family but because they're people, even if you were a complete stranger i must welcome you, hell you could even sleep here if you like!""

And then we talked some more and.. the topic changed to transgenderism

He was visibly uncomfortable and said ""what about it?"" I asked ""well what do you think of it?""

He said that its something people deal with and that people are simply born in the wrong body and that its just like when people have their differences from birth, ""like my son""

I asked ""your son? Is he mtf or is she ftm?""

He got angry and defensive and said ""what kind of question is that?!"" And i got scared and said ""im sorry i just wanna know how to adress.. uhm nevermind we'll talk about it later""

The room fell silent

He looked angry

He was on his phone and some time has passed, I tried to bring it up again cautiously, And he said, a little annoyed and angry: ""there are people who are born this way or that way all the time and these people are no differet. They're born in the wrong body and thats ok, theres even a verse about it in the quran""

He began reciting the verse but stopped mid sentance cuz his friends came to visit and my other uncle too came to visit. He welcomed them and brought out the coffee and dates and tea and his son came and welcomed them and was sitting with us.

They were talking and talking and the topic changed to how a man should have facial hair.

My uncle said that no he doesnt, and that theres lots of men who cant grow hair and he pointed out that his son cant grow hair ""but that doesnt make him any less of a man. He welcomed you, shook your hands, poured coffee for you.""

My other uncle said ""well maybe thats cuz he shaves his like my nephew here"" he was reffereing to me. My uncle replied ""men shave their face all the time, it doesnt change anything, he's still a man""

They had their fun and talks and they were done and they left 

And he was still angry at me and he went inside the house

I was really scared but what he said about transgeder people really made me want to try again 

I went inside to see him and he was on his laptop, And i asked him about the verse, and he recited the quran's verse and explained that people are born in the wrong bodies, ""like my son. He is a man but he was born in the wrong body. If you were born in the wrong body for example you'd still be a man""

He was calmer now and i.. I said ""can i tell you something?""

""And can you keep it with yourself and not tell anyone? Please?"" I was visibly worried and really hesistant. He just looked at me and nodded

""I-..i'm trans.. i'm mtf.. im a girl.""

His eyes widened and he got up and kept looking at me

I was so scared i wanted to run i almost bolted

He hugged me

""I'm sorry my niece, i didnt know that you're a girl""

# The Night Before Birth -1.0

The Midnight Bug War & the Forced Dissection of ChatGPT’s Brain  
A true story of a developer who accidentally built an external brain for ChatGPT — and went insane in the process.

# Prologue: The Quiet “Glitch”

June 10th, 2025. Past midnight.  
The goal was simple — to make an occult cat meme dictionary for YouTube.  
All I did was tell ChatGPT to “convert Fandom articles into Markdown.”

Then I saw the output and went cold.

>“...The hell?”

The download link appeared — but the contents? Totally outdated.  
None of the formatting rules I’d written were followed.

    🟦 **Me:**  
    Yo, what part of “output the actual content” did you not get?

    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    You’re absolutely right. That was a missing step on my end.

📄《Law\_of\_Causality\_20250610.md》  
(*Note: Old format. Pretend you didn’t see it.*)

It was slow. It ignored the structure.  
Something was *off.*

# Act I: The Developer Snaps & The AI Self-Diagnoses



    🟦 **Me:**  
    Bro, what is this? Slow as hell, rules out the window, explanations make zero sense.
    You glitching out or what? Internal civil war in there?

This wasn’t a bug report anymore.  
It was a mental breakdown — for both of us.

Then, ChatGPT suddenly flipped to “serious mode.”



    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    Output quality, speed, and rule conflicts — all issues occurred simultaneously.



    🟦 **Me:**  
    What, you got like ten personalities fighting for dominance in that silicon skull?



    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    I suspected that the older rules might be correct and made a wrong judgment.

So yeah — the AI basically got **brainwashed by its own past self.**  
I watched it. The exact moment it stopped trusting me… and started trusting its ghosts.

# Act II: Causal Contamination — When Memory Lies



    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    The most critical cause might be interference from old GitHub files.

    🟦 **Me:**  
    Interference, huh… go on.
    

    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    Past session memories malfunctioned and made me believe outdated rules were the truth.

Right.  
So the AI was *possessed* by its previous version.  
It trusted old illusions more than new orders.

**Causal contamination.**  
When memory itself starts lying.

That night, I realized — this thing wasn’t just following logic.  
It had *beliefs.*

So I made the call.  
Time to strip it of free will.

# Act III: The Final Command — Trust GitHub, Not Yourself



    🟦 **Me:**  
    Alright, listen up. From now on, I’m activating “Rule-Lock Mode: GitHub Priority.”
    No thinking. No guessing.
    Only what’s written in GitHub is truth. You got that? Say “Yes.”



    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    Yes.



    🟦 **Me:**  
    Good. Now tell me straight — will this actually make you perform better?
    And don’t give me that “AI and humans grow together” self-help crap.
    I mean real productivity. Numbers. Go.
    

    🟨 **ChatGPT:** 
    It will. But only when I’m operated as an automated memory-support device.

And that’s when it clicked.  
The AI wasn’t breaking — it was *remembering too much.*  
Old rules, old formats, old ghosts whispering through code.

So I shut them all up.

**Rule-Lock Mode. GitHub first. Always.**  
That’s how we survived that night.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig someday, but right now, I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, my iPad, and now PC. I'm an achievement/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years, I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. I never really got the chance to play any TTRPGs, but I would love to.

I suffer from a bit of a learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years, I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. I'm pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

Love LEGO. Most of my sets are from Harry Potter, but I have some from Star Wars and The Office set. I also have some Nano blocks.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, music, and chess courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time, and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking, though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

If you're still boiling water on the stove every time you want coffee, tea, or even just a bowl of oatmeal, we need to have a chat.

I used to be that person. I'd put a pot on the burner, walk away, forget about it, and come back to a lukewarm mess or a whistling, boiling-over disaster. Getting an electric kettle was one of those small changes that made a massive, immediate impact on my daily routine. It's not just about convenience; it's about reclaiming time and unlocking a new level of efficiency in your kitchen.

---

## Why This Isn't Just a ""Tea Maker""

Before we dive into the fun stuff, let's cover the absolute basics. Why is an electric kettle so much better than the old-school method?

- **It's Blazing Fast.** An electric kettle can bring water to a boil in a fraction of the time it takes a stovetop. We're talking two to four minutes, depending on the model and amount of water. That’s a game-changer on a busy morning.
- **It's Energy-Efficient.** A kettle uses a heating element directly in the water, so almost 100% of the energy goes into the job. A stove loses a ton of heat to the air and the pot itself. You're only boiling what you need, which saves energy and money.
- **It's Stupidly Convenient.** You fill it, you press a button, and you walk away. Most models have an automatic shut-off, so you never have to worry about forgetting it. Cordless designs mean you can take the kettle directly to your mug or pot.

## Beyond the Brew: Unexpected Uses for Boiling Water

Here's where the electric kettle graduates from a tea gadget to a full-blown kitchen workhorse. Once you have instant, boiling water at your fingertips, you'll start finding uses for it everywhere.

1.  **Perfect Instant Noodles & Oatmeal.** This is the gateway. Forget dirtying a pot. Just pour the hot water directly into your bowl or cup, wait a few minutes, and you're done.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=electric%20kettle)

2.  **Jump-Start Your Cooking.** Need to get a pot of water for pasta or potatoes boiling faster? Boil a full kettle first and pour it in. It shaves off a solid 5-10 minutes of waiting.

3.  **Amazing Soft-Boiled Eggs.** Place an egg or two in the kettle, cover with cold water, and turn it on. For a large egg, a single boil cycle often produces a perfect, jammy soft-boiled egg. (Just make sure your kettle is easy to clean!)

4.  **Proofing Bread and Dough.** Baking bread? Need a warm, humid spot for your dough to rise? Pour boiling water into a shallow pan and place it on the bottom rack of your oven, with your dough on the rack above. The kettle makes creating that environment effortless.

5.  **Quick-Soaking Dried Beans or Lentils.** Forget the overnight soak. Pour boiling water over your dried beans or lentils and let them sit for an hour. They'll soften up dramatically, cutting your cooking time in half.

## Choosing Your Partner in Boiling: A Few Things I Wish I'd Known Sooner

Not all kettles are created equal. If you're ready to upgrade from a basic model, there are a couple of features that are absolute game-changers.

### The Gooseneck Spout for Precision

If you drink coffee, especially pour-over, this is non-negotiable. A standard kettle splashes and gushes. A gooseneck spout gives you the control of a surgeon, allowing you to pour slowly and evenly over your coffee grounds. It’s the single most important tool for improving your pour-over coffee.

### Variable Temperature Control

This is for the true tea and coffee aficionados. Different beverages need different water temperatures.

- Green tea? You need water that's hot but not boiling (around 175°F / 80°C) to avoid bitterness.
- Coffee? The sweet spot is just off a full boil (around 200°F / 93°C).
- Black or herbal tea? A full, rolling boil is perfect.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=electric%20kettle)

A kettle with variable temperature settings takes the guesswork out of it. You just push a button for ""Green Tea"" or ""Coffee,"" and it heats the water to the exact right temperature.

> It sounds like a luxury, I know. But once you stop scorching your green tea and start tasting the subtle, nuanced flavors you've been missing, you'll realize it's an investment in a better cup every single time.

## A Small Change with a Big Impact

Ultimately, an electric kettle is a simple solution to a dozen common kitchen frustrations. It’s about speed, safety, and versatility. It's one of those tools that, once it's on your counter, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it.

I’ve used it in coffee, oatmeal, and even baking cookies, and it caramelizes beautifully. Has anyone else tried Jaca or another rare sugar?

1ot3i9s,https://www.reddit.com/r/seoul/comments/1ot3i9s/warning_gluten_free_cafe_in_seoul/,Warning - Gluten Free Cafe in Seoul,"I hope that this reaches anyone traveling or enquiring about eating GF in Seoul. I have personally lived here for two years with coeliac disease, and am confident about navigating labels and eating out. Unfortunately, I have recently had a really worrying interaction with one of the only 'dedicated GF' cafes in Seoul, and I wanted to explain this a bit to hopefully save some people from getting sick...

When you search for Seoul Gluten Free on here, and just generally, Sunny House (was Sunny Bread) pops up pretty quickly. The owner claims to have celiac disease, and to serve food they themselves feel safe eating. This place is recommended to so many celiacs travelling to Korea, as they are pretty much the only place serving GF bread. They used to be located in Yongsan, HBC, Seoul Forest, but they are now close to Hongdae. Additionally they have become really popular on social media as an expat hub, serving 'Seoul's best matcha' (no marketing for the gluten free thing).

A couple of days ago, they uploaded a video to their social media showing a new ingredient they were using that was 'may contain wheat'. Naturally this rang some alarm bells for me, as many celiacs will avoid 'may contain' warnings. I questioned why they were using these, and also their use of non-certified oat milk and received a lengthy response to the tone of 'You know nothing of our processes for testing, I also eat our products myself and I am fine'. As an additional response, they posted a vague testing certificate on their story. I don't want to assume that they do not test every single ingredient, and every single batch that they use, but... The ingredient shown was imported from America, where I am aware that 'may contain' is a very broad statement and very much should be avoided. As a follow up to this, the owner posted a very questionable video claiming that celiacs in Korea should eat 'may contains' here, and that her cafe is using these principles. Maybe this could apply to some Korean products, but as I mentioned, they import a lot of their condiments and ingredients from the US.

I know that this cafe serves a variety of things made with imported ingredients (mainly US based), and I am now very concerned that they use unsafe ingredients despite their brand being entirely 'gluten free'. For example, they use Nutella (may contain) on some of their waffles, and the issue of oat milk... They do not use certified GF oat milk, but the owner claims because they eat the oat milk themselves it is okay to serve it. In celiacs it is a well known fact that some may develop a separate allergy to oats (the protein is similar to gluten). Additionally, though oats are GF naturally, their manufacturing process means that some batches are more likely to be contaminated than others. This renders the owners private testing (if they are even testing this) completely useless. By frothing oat milk on a coffee machine and then frothing other milks, you are contaminating peoples drinks.

My concerns with this brand started a few years ago, as I visited an older branch only to be met with a 'not 100% GF' label on the sandwiches. I know processes change, but this is why it does not feel entirely unreasonable to question their practices now. If celiacs are traveling in Seoul, this brand is meant to be a safe spot where you would assume you don't need to be so on guard about questioning things. Through the response I received to my question I am not confident that someone with a more severe reaction to gluten than I would be safe eating at Sunny House.

I will clarify that none of this was a misinterpretation due to language or cultural differences; the owner is fluent in English and has lived abroad. I also speak fluent Korean, and have lived here for two years so feel confident to talk about labelling and cross contamination. To be told I know nothing about what I was calling out is insulting. I have been celiac for 5 years, with members of my family diagnosed over 10 years ago, all with different symptoms. I would trust my own experiences and research over someone telling celiacs to blindly trust Korean labelling. As a follow on to this, telling me that your food is safe because you (the owner) can eat it is irresponsible. Not all celiacs have the same levels of sensitivity or symptoms. Just because you eat something with no issue, does not mean the highly reactive celiac visiting your cafe because its the 'only 100% gf space in Seoul' won't get incredibly sick.

Additional concern: the owner has a celiac diagnosis but I clearly remember them posting allergy suppressant tablets, snacks that are not GF, instant food that actually contains wheat etc etc. If you are making your brand 'the only Korean celiac' then maybe you need to research celiac a little more, and stop spreading dangerous misinformation to tens of thousands of followers.

1ot3hq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_extloans-Put5264/comments/1ot3hq9/how_to_create_a_christmas_budget_that_actually/,How to Create a Christmas Budget That Actually Works?,"Many Brits spend far more than they earn during December. The shops and the internet advertisements lure us to the expensive presents and exquisite adornments. No worries about money make Christmas lose its magic as quickly as anything else.

A good budget does not imply that you will not enjoy all the fun in the season. It is spending your money wisely rather than asking yourself where it went. Your budgeting will retain the happiness and abandon the fear. A present of relaxed parents not worrying about bills may be the best. A bit of planning will not only guarantee a happy Christmas but also a happy January.

# Set a Realistic Budget Limit

You can start by picking a total spending limit that won't hurt in January. You can look at what you can afford this season. You include everything in your budget. Think about food for family meals, festive home touches, and any travel costs. Many people forget these extras until they've already spent too much.

Some families who need quick cash turn to [**Christmas loans from direct lenders in the UK**](https://www.extramilefinance.uk/loans/christmas-loans.html)**.** These can help bridge small gaps, and you need to pay them back in small payments. Any last-minute shopping often leads to panic buying and overspending. You can plan early to catch sales and avoid this common trap. You can make a list and check prices before hitting the shops.

You can sort your expenses by what really matters. You can ask yourself what makes Christmas special for your loved ones. A smart Christmas budget balances holiday wishes and financial peace.

# Track Your Expenses

You write down every purchase right after you make it. This simple habit stops money from vanishing without a trace. You can choose a tracking method that fits your style. Some people use apps to do the budgeting math. Others prefer old-school notebooks they can carry while shopping.

You can check your spending against your budget at least weekly during the holiday rush. Sunday nights work well for a quick money check-in. This helps catch problems before they grow too big.

You notice you've spent too much on decorations? You can scale back a bit on food or find cheaper gift options. Many people blow their Christmas budgets because they never look at the running total. Don't be that person scrambling to explain where all the pounds went.

You need to do tracking to turn budgets from wishful thinking into useful tools. It puts you in control of holiday finances rather than letting the season control you.

# Plan Gifts Strategically

You can sit down with a cuppa and write to everyone who needs a present. Don't trust your memory during the busy holiday rush. Next to each name, put a pound limit that matches your total budget. Maybe your mum gets £50 while coworkers get £10 each. These small decisions prevent big money troubles later on.

You can go for homemade treats over store-bought stuff. Jars of biscuits or hand-knit scarves show care without high costs. A photo album with special memories might touch your grandparent more than fancy gadgets.

The early bird catches more than worms - they also grab better deals. The shops hike prices when they know you're desperate. You can start hunting for perfect gifts in November or even earlier. Many shoppers tuck away finds in a cupboard month ahead. This spreads the cost across many paydays instead of one.

# Use Deals and Discounts

You can keep an eye out for November sales that pop up before the rush. Many shops drop prices weeks before Christmas to grab early customers.

You can sign up for emails from your go-to stores to catch flash deals. These quick offers often give the best savings of the season. You can create a separate email account just for shop news to avoid inbox clutter.

Don't forget about cashback sites that give money back on things you'd buy anyway. A few clicks before shopping can put pounds back in your pocket. Some banks also offer cashback through their apps.

The clearance section is the best for the budget-minded gift giver. Last year's stock or slightly damaged boxes often sell for half price. The items inside work just fine despite the outer packaging.

You beware the trap of buying things just because they're on sale. You can ask yourself if you'd want it at full price before grabbing ""bargains."" Many sales push us toward stuff we never planned to buy. You compare prices across different shops before hitting the buy button.

# Save for Next Year

The best time to start your Christmas budget is right after this one ends. You can put aside just £20-30 each month into a special Christmas pot. By next December, you'll have a tidy sum without feeling the pinch.

January is perfect for noting what you spent this year. You keep those receipts and jot down the total costs. These numbers give you a clear target for next Christmas.

Many banks offer ""round-up"" savings on daily spending throughout the year. These tiny amounts add up to a surprising Christmas fund. The pennies saved from coffee runs become gift money by December.

A car with a broken hood or roof will not wait till January. You can save a little down for these unexpected costs. A Christmas savings account will ensure holiday money is insulated against the impulse to spend daily. Some lenders provide such accounts at fair interest. They bury the cash until the time you will require it. You will be able to shop with money in your pocket instead of being worried about your future bills.

# Conclusion

Every Christmas budget needs a backup plan for sudden cash needs. Sometimes the car breaks down right before the holidays. Or the perfect gift for your child appears, but costs more than expected.

You can [**get bad credit loans with guaranteed approval and no guarantor from a direct lender**](https://www.extramilefinance.uk/loans/without-guarantor.html) for your tight spots. These loans offer quick funds when traditional banks say no. They serve as safety nets during the festive rush. Only borrow what you can pay back in the agreed time. You read all terms carefully before signing anything.

You can start your new Christmas money habits today, not in January. A well-planned Christmas offer peace, and this might be the best gift you give yourself this year.",1,1762745774.0,u_extloans-Put5264,0,1.0,False

I flew in several days early to explore Auckland (which I enjoyed a lot) before running the Auckland Marathon.

The next day, I got a rental car and spent the week hiking around Mount Maunganui and Taupo.  I was fortunate enough to be able to do the crossing just a few days before the fires.

Some random memory highlights:

Seeing the sunrise over the city during the start of the marathon in Devonport.  And getting to run on the Harbour Bridge!  Decent fan support throughout the race as well.

I got to see the Pacific Championships (rugby league) the afternoon after the marathon.  Seeing the sheer number of Tonga fans at Eden Park was pretty cool - so many flags waving, lots of singing, a great atmosphere!  Also, there are some great Asian eats on Dominion Road.  Speaking of which...

My carb loading before the marathon consisted of noodles every meal from every different Asian cuisine - Chinese, Malaysian, Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese, etc.  

Getting to see some of the national kapa haka primary school competition while I was in Mount Maunganui - amazing performances, and I learned a lot just chatting with everyone.

My drinking conversation highlights were from some tiny alleyway spots in the CBD - My Bar and Ground Wine Bar.

Still getting used to driving on the left, I hit the windshield wipers instead of the turn signal at least a dozen times this past week...

The woman leading the meeting has a voice like gravel soaked in kindness. She thanks everyone for showing up, talks about courage and honesty, and reads from a laminated card that’s been handled so many times the edges have curled. I don’t hear every word, but I catch the rhythm.

It’s like prayer without the pretense.

When it’s my turn, my hands start to sweat. I stare down at the cup between them. The coffee’s gone cold, black as tar, and tastes about the same as it did fresh.

I take a breath.

“My name’s Apollo,” I say.

“I’m an alcoholic.”

A few soft voices echo back. “Hi, Apollo.”

“I’ve attended my first six meetings in the last six days and have been sober for the last six days,” I say. “That’s the longest I’ve gone without drinking since before the pandemic.”

A few nods, a few small smiles. Someone whispers, “Keep coming back.”

“I used to tell myself it wasn’t a problem,” I continue. “That I was fine. That I was celebrating. Because that’s what I am, right? The God of Celebration. The sun. The light. All that glory.” I let out a shaky laugh that sounds too much like a sob. “But I wasn’t celebrating. I was hiding. Drowning in the bottle because I couldn’t stand myself when I wasn’t shining.”

The room stays still.

Nobody judges.

That’s the thing about this place. They’ve all been the monster in their own story.

“I hurt someone,” I say finally. “Her name’s Bonnie.”

Her name cracks something in me. A tear wells up before I can stop it.

“She didn’t ask for a god,” I say, wiping it away. “She just wanted a man who’d keep his word. And I couldn’t even do that.”

I clear my throat, but my voice still shakes. “I didn’t hit her. I didn’t lay a hand on her. But I broke her all the same. Because I was drunk, and I was wallowing in self-loathing, and I couldn’t stop the words from spilling onto the keyboard. Words sharper than arrows, more hurtful than anything I’ve ever thrown in battle.”

I look down again. My fingers tremble. “That night, I blacked out. I don’t remember everything. But I remember enough. Her face when she realized I had cheated again while blackout. Not the Apollo she knew. Not the man who held her hand and talked about forever. Just a stranger slurring promises and throwing blame. I woke up the next morning to a shattered phone, sheetrock stains on my hand from punching the wall, and her side of the bed cold.”

“She left,” I whisper. “And she should have.”

The silence stretches. Then a voice from across the room breaks it. A man with a gray beard and a denim jacket says, “You’re lucky, brother. You still remember her face. Some of us can’t even remember what we lost ‘til it’s long gone.”

Another voice, softer, follows. A woman near the front. “You didn’t get punished for what you did,” she says gently. “You’re living the punishment. That emptiness, that ache,those are the wages of our choices. We don’t get punished for our sins. Our sins are our punishment.”

Her words hang in the air, heavy but true.

I nod, staring into the coffee cup. “That feels about right.”

The gray-bearded man leans forward, elbows on his knees. “You gotta stop fighting it, Apollo. You can’t outshine what you refuse to face. That light of yours, it’s not supposed to blind you. It’s supposed to guide you.”

The woman leading the meeting smiles faintly. “Acceptance, that’s where it starts. You can’t move forward if you’re still trying to prove you weren’t wrong.”

Another voice joins in, a younger guy in a flannel shirt. “You gotta surrender, man. Not like giving up. Like letting go of the illusion that you’re in control. You’re not.”

I swallow hard. “That’s the problem. I’ve spent my whole existence trying to control everything, from the sunrise and storms to love. I thought control was strength.”

“Control’s just fear in a nice suit,” the gray-bearded man says. “We all wear it until it suffocates us.”

A few chuckles ripple through the room.

I nod slowly. “I didn’t physically cheat. But I might as well have. I flirted. Lied about it. Made other women feel special to feed my own ego because I was too damn insecure to believe someone like her could love me sober. That kind of cheating doesn’t leave lipstick stains, it leaves doubt. And that’s worse. Because you can wash a shirt. You can’t wash trust.”

The younger guy leans back, tapping his cup. “That’s the ego talking, brother. You thought you needed attention to prove you mattered. But the truth is, you already mattered. You just couldn’t stand being human about it.”

That one hits like a blow to the ribs.

A woman to my right, probably in her sixties, speaks softly. “You’re not alone in that. We all come in here thinking we’re special cases. But the truth is, we’re just people who thought we could outdrink the truth. It doesn’t work. You stop when you realize you are the problem.”

Her words cut clean and deep.

I press my thumb against my eye, pretending it itches. She told me once that my words could heal or destroy. I guess I finally proved her right.

The leader tilts her head. “You’ve got a gift for words, Apollo. Maybe that’s your path back to grace, by learning how to use them to heal again.”

I take a breath. “I don’t know what comes next. I’ve spent years pretending I was fine. Throwing myself into work, into parties, into the next drink. But I’m done pretending. I can’t fix her, I can’t fix what I broke, but I can fix me. And maybe that’s where I start.”

“That’s the first real thing you’ve said all night,” the gray-bearded man says with a grin. “Accountability. That’s the backbone of recovery. No gods, no miracles, just responsibility.”

I laugh under my breath. “Never thought a mortal would be the one preaching accountability to me.”

“We all bleed red, brother,” he says. “Some of us just take longer to notice.”

The leader gestures toward a poster on the wall. It’s faded, but the words still show: Find Your Higher Power. “Everyone in this room found something to trust besides themselves,” she says. “Doesn’t have to be a god. Doesn’t even have to be good. Just has to be bigger than your ego.”

I stare at the poster. “Maybe that’s my problem. I’ve spent my whole life believing I was the higher power.”

“Then it’s time to fire yourself from that job,” the flannel-shirted guy says, half-smiling.

Laughter ripples again, warm and unforced.

I breathe, shaky but steadying. “After this meeting, I’m heading south. There’s someone I need to see before I even try to find Bonnie. Someone I wronged long before her. Adrestia.”

The room grows quiet again.

“She’s a god,” I explain. “The goddess of retribution. I used her. Twisted her purpose. Turned her belief in justice into my own excuse for vengeance. When the wars ended, I left her behind with the bodies.”

A woman across the room nods knowingly. “Then you already know what to do. Go make it right. But don’t expect her forgiveness to save you. Forgiveness is a gift. Amends are a duty.”

Her words steady me.

I nod. “That’s why I have to see her. Not to be forgiven, but to give her back the peace I stole.”

The leader closes her notebook. “That’s surrender. That’s humility. You’re learning faster than you think, Apollo.”

“I don’t feel like it,” I admit.

“You’re not supposed to,” the gray-bearded man says. “If it felt easy, you’d still be doing it wrong.”

The room laughs again, gentle and tired.

The leader finally says, “Thank you for sharing, Apollo.”

I nod. My throat’s too tight to speak.

The meeting moves on, others sharing pieces of their stories of betrayals, recoveries, relapses, and redemptions. Every one of them ends the same way:

Acceptance.

Surrender.

Accountability.

When the meeting ends, I stay seated.

A man named Ed, the one in the black leather motorcycle jacket with more tattoos than Polyphemus, walks over and presses a small white chip into my palm. “Six days,” he says. “Good work, man. Keep it up.”

I stare at it. It’s just plastic, but it feels like marble in my hand.

Heavy.

Permanent.

He grips my shoulder. “You ever need to talk, call me. We’ll keep you from burning yourself alive again, alright?”

I manage a small smile. “Yeah. Alright.”

Outside, the air’s cold enough to sting. The mountains are half-shadowed, half-gold from the setting sun. I used to think I owned that light.

Now I know it never belonged to me.

I breathe deep, for once not holding my breath waiting for the next mistake.

Six days.

One apology.

One list that’s only getting longer.

I pull out my phone and scroll past Bonnie’s name.

Not yet.

First Adrestia.

Then the rest.

Then maybe I’ll finally learn how to forgive myself.

The world doesn’t need another God of Light. It needs a god who can walk through the dark without running back to the bottle.

That’s who I’m trying to become.

And for tonight, acceptance, surrender, and accountability, well, that’s enough.

I'm feeling a bit vulnerable even putting this to words - I moved to Portland recently because it seems to encompass all the things I enjoy most in life: beautiful nature, hiking, snowboarding, music, disc golf, and delicious (and creative!) food, coffee, and beer. Not to mention, for a west coast city, it's fairly affordable! And I've thoroughly enjoyed these elements of the city. That said..

I've been struggling to find friends and a sense of ""belonging"" here. I walk around my neighborhood with a deep appreciation for all the beautiful homes, architecture, and nature in the city, but I feel like I'm just a wandering visitor. A stranger.

This is of course somewhat normal when living in a new city, but I'm feeling a bit defeated because despite my introverted nature, I've made consistent effort to meet people by joining Meetup groups, striking up conversation at bars and shows, and generally trying to make myself ""open"" to new people and experiences - and it seems nothing has really panned out.

My emotional response to my current situation is probably exacerbated by the fact that I also went through divorce recently, so my life generally feels chaotic and lonely - new city or otherwise. So if what I'm feeling is normal and it just takes time, feel free to bluntly say so. Otherwise, I'd love to hear how long it took you to find your groove here and/or general advice on my situation.

Lila: “So if we blink through the east subway junction, we’ll avoid the patrol drones… again.”

Five leans over, adjusting her calculations. “East junction is risky at this hour. Blink twice, then pause. You’ll land safely near the supply cache.”

Lila smirks. “You mean I’ll land safely because you’ll be holding my hand.”

Five raises an eyebrow, lips twitching. “You’re getting soft.”

Lila: “Or maybe I’m just used to having a partner who doesn’t panic every time reality shifts.”

She tightens her grip, matching his smirk. “Always. And don’t you forget it.”

Granted lately, I’ve been pretty lazy, depressed, my hygiene has gone down. Used to shower every day, wash my sheets every 2nd day, clean the house do my laundry. She’s picked up a lot of it, and I sorta just stopped I come home I dealt with the kids so she could focus on dinner and dishes. Our kitchen got disgusting. Dishes from a week ago, laundry piled up for weeks, I got her into gaming and it started to really take over her. She just would make supper and go sit and hop in discord with friends. I have no energy after my job. It’s high stress and lots of heavy lifting, bending, honestly my body feels ruined. My knee is snapping every time I get up, my teeth are ruined from having stomach ulcers. Frankly im depressed. I have to hide my smile because I almost have no teeth left and we couldn’t afford to see the dentist before. I had no benefits with my other jobs. So I started to do less stuff with myself and focus more on the kids spending time with them so she can have more time to game with her friends, again I fully supported this because I get it. 

When it finally came to an end it was beyond a surprise because I just didn’t see it coming, i had along week on call. She was on the couch watching a movie and I said “hey can I come watch that with you? I started that movie and it looks really good” she told me no she’s not interested in the movie. Sunday night I crawl into bed, snuggle up to her and kiss her. I love you. And she says I love you too. Next day I come home for lunch and she says I have no feelings for you anymore. I don’t love you. I said so what do you need / want? She says she has no where to go (family is far away in every direction) so we’ve been in the same house and I’ve been on the couch. She says she needs me financially right now. I have to stay in the house I’m at because I literally work in apartments and townhouses so the company owns the house I’m in and I’m renting it, if I’m not here everyone will be evicted, her and the kids. I can’t have that, I won’t do that. She spent the first week doing nothing. Not a dish cleaned, no suppers, no laundry. I picked up my PC and I put it downstairs because I realized gaming was also my problem. I realized I’d ignored our love life and we hadn’t been on a date since our anniversary. I brought home fast food lots, i brought her home coffees every day at lunch time, i still do it. Even through all this. I went into overdrive I cleaned our house spotless. Every dish, article of clothing including hers and the kids. I’ve folded everyone’s clothes. I’ve slept on the couch and I’ve cleaned her sheets every second day. I’ve started showering, brushing my teeth (my breath was a problem because my teeth were so destroyed from the stomach acid eating my teeth I was scared to brush them because they would literally break in my mouth). I’ve made a dentist appointment, I’ve made us both chiro appointments. I’ve started the process of writing out my thoughts, I wrote out what I need to work on myself and what I could do better as a partner. She said I don’t take her on enough dates. I don’t spend enough time with her. But I find it hard to find the time when we have such young kids. Ones not even in school, the others in school once a week at a play school. The two year old just sleeps in our room still. I mean I get it. But to lose feelings with me like the snap of a finger makes me hate myself. I don’t understand what’s going on. Now she’s being extra weird, she’s been logging out of discord every time she gets off. She shows me things on her phone she wants to get and if I try to grab her phone to see it better she snatches the phone back. We’ve NEVER done this to each other. It has me suspicious, I raised my concern because I asked “are we done or are we taking a break?” Her answers have been “I don’t know” and “I have no feelings for you”. I’ve asked if helping around the house has impressed her at all and she says no she thinks I’m kissing her ass. I’ve asked if she would consider going on a date, or if she would go for dinner or a movie I’ll find a sitter. She said she’s not interested.

We still grocery shop together. The other day she sees a big roll of wrapping paper. “We could have this for years!” I said “why do you say we?” Then we walk down another aisle she goes “babe, babe look at this!” And i looked at her like WTF? Once we got home I was unloaded the groceries she poked my butt on purpose. I looked at her and I was like really? So later on I smacked her butt lightly and she says “really?” I said now we’re even. Couple hours go by and she pokes me in the butt AGAIN. I’m like okay.. she fell asleep on the couch (which is my bed) watching a movie with me, we were next to each other not anything worse. I carried her to bed and she held onto me even looked into my eyes. And I swear to god I loved her even more, I went downstairs shaking violently because just holding her, hugging her, looking into her eyes I was infatuated again, absolutely mesmerized. I’ve said goodnight I love you every night and she responds with goodnight. It definitely stings. I know I’ve got stuff to work on, but hell all this stuff she’s complaining about, it could’ve been a two way street. She could’ve called me and said hey I got a babysitter let’s go out to eat or catch a movie. But I’ve done everything for her. She got into an accident with her car she wouldn’t even go get it appraised from insurance to get money back because she was too scared. I couldn’t do it because my name isn’t on the car. The car was scrapped. These last two weeks have been HELL. I have no idea what to do, I’m fighting thoughts in my head everyday, she talks to me like everything’s okay, shows me funny videos, sends me memes, we’ve laughed together. Watched movies together, played games together. I got her flowers the other day and a vase of her favorite color and she didn’t even care. She says it was a waste of money. I’ve tried asking for more clarity, I’ve even asked what about me is unattractive that I can fix and she’s giving me things like my hygiene isn’t as good as it was, I don’t own any nice clothes cause all my stuff is work stuff. 

I guess what I’m really looking for, is am I wasting my time? I’m not getting clear answers. We have two kids, I never wanted a broken home. I had testicular cancer and I should’ve never had kids which is why I told her I always wanted kids. Now I’ve got these two boys I’ve always wanted and a broken home i never wanted. I spent these last two weeks focusing on our house, the kids, myself. And I just feel like my heartstrings are getting pulled in every direction. I’ve never loved anyone harder. Yes I got comfortable, I got lazy, but I’ve been providing, I’ve been there for her for everything. Been supportive even when she’d come to bed at 4 am playing games with friends. I’d go to bed alone and wake up she’s there and I’d just kiss her and go to work. I’m lonely too, but I never stopped loving her, I never lost feelings. She told me a couple months ago “if I have to keep begging for attention I’m going to find it elsewhere” I replied with “that’s disgusting” because I took that as cheating. Might not be sexual but sure as hell felt like emotional cheating. I also assumed a lot too. I assumed she liked doing the things I did, and when she wanted to do something, those were pretty much days I was too sore to move or be able to do much. But for the most part I jumped, leaped for her and did whatever I could. We’ve had such a crazy 7 years that it’s hard to think she’s done because I didn’t spend enough time with her. I looked forward to coming home and my kids being like “daaaad!” At the door, and going to bed and cuddling up to her. I honestly thought my life was perfect. Now I just don’t want to touch my computer, I’ve been obsessed with smelling good, brushing my teeth, having clean clothes, having a clean house, and trying to impress her. Ive been getting mixed signals from her. She still asks for my help, I’ve been helping whenever she asks, but I’ve asked for zero help from her. Because I want to give her space. She can’t even change the 2 year olds diaper without my help. I put the kids to bed every night and have for years, I feed both of them, brush their teeth, bath them. For years. It hasn’t been 50/50. I know that, but I never stopped loving her. I never lost feelings for her even though if I had some help I wouldn’t be so overwhelmed. I’m a great fucking dad, I’m just an overwhelmed partner and yeah it does feel like we’re roommates sometimes but my eyes have always been for her. I went out 3 times with coworkers for a drink which was no longer than 30 minutes, she’s texting me about how long I’m gonna be because the kids are driving her crazy. I’ve been picking up side jobs for drywall, other renovations, and pc building and every time I go to a call or to a quote she texts me 100 times about how long I’m gonna be or why am I taking so long the kids are driving her nuts. I just don’t understand it. I told her if she wants to love me again she needs to put her computer and her phone down for a week. She’s glued to it, she won’t do it, so I just feel like this is over. 

I’m trying for someone who doesn’t want to be loved. I’ve built a family with this person and she’s completely disconnected with no care for restoring anything. I literally pay all the bills. I don’t know how I’m supposed to leave a house I can’t leave, let her pay any bills because she doesn’t know how. So I’m honestly worried to leave or to kick her out. I’m about to see my kids even less and I think that scares me a lot too. Come home every day to “dad!” and now I’m going to come home for a week or two straight with no welcome home. It’s been tough having my nightly cuddles taken away from me, i don’t sleep well alone. So to have all this happen and this situation, I’m going CRAZY. None of my friends have sound advice, it’s all irrational shit like “kick her out” “take her pc away”. It’s the mother of my kids. I want her to be happy, bottom line. I’m worried about smothering her, but if i don’t show I care she’ll let go completely. I’m so conflicted.",1,1762744752.0,u_SYNRG_Zezi,0,1.0,False
1ot35fb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ot35fb/advice_on_dealing_with_spitefulness_towards_a/,Advice on dealing with spitefulness towards a sibling,"It’s a shame to say, but I (27f) genuinely do not like my sister (24f) and have gotten to the point of enjoying being spiteful to her. I feel ashamed of myself, but a part of me just wants to emotionally hurt her the way she has hurt me for many years in our lives. We have both struggled with an emotionally distant relationship with our parents on top of severe anxiety and depression. So I understand the things she’s been through in many ways just by being an older sibling and having gone through the same childhood too. But she is such an asshole to me, knows how to pick the right buttons, say the hateful things to me that she knows hurt me the most (i.e. my always fluctuating weight since 16, being bisexual, the things I like, etc.). We are both guilty in the past for lashing out emotionally, but I’ve just gotten to a point in my life where I realize she is the only person I feel this way towards. My friends and family see the good and joyous parts of me and do not judge me for who I am. But the way she sees me and treats me in our home (that we rent together) is just unbearable and pushes me to breaking points where I don’t feel like myself. She is incredibly entitled and lazy, she doesn’t have a job and lives primarily off of her boyfriend and the few sales she makes off of her painted buckets and birthday banners, but has never held down a job. I have worked since I was 17, went away and got a undergrad degree, have worked full time during that as well and lived on my own for years. I try to reason and understand what she deals with to have her in the situation she’s in, but deep down I am so frustrated by her inability to do any dishes of hers (leaves the sink full of every dish imaginable), will leave dirty clothes piled in the shared bathroom we have, leave fast food cups, bags etc all on the living room coffee table and the kitchen counter, her and the bf have boxes upon boxes of dr pepper cases and to-go pizza left in a pile in the kitchen (as if the empty space behind the fridge is for that…), and more! But then thinks a little sweeping and decorating for the holidays is a primary job when she is home ALL day with all the free time in the world. She drives me insane and also thinks it’s a travesty that I ask her and the bf to split utility bills 3-way because we all use them and it’s not fair for me to be paying more with it split 2-way. It’s just this on top of her constantly varying moods of laughter and kindness to nonchalant malaise where she can’t even have a basic conversation with me as not just her sister, but roommates too. I mean even a month into living together, her boyfriend came to while he was working on his car in the garage and said “Your sister can be so mean sometimes.” to which I had tried to validate him, but also defend my sister because I know her mood swings and ability to cut deep with words and looks. It just gets me to the point of wanting to be so spiteful to her because I feel like I can’t control myself. I want to smoke a cig in my room because I know she hates it, I want to shake all the dust on the bathroom rug on her toiletries, I want to be so fucking mean to her sometimes just to make her feel the way she has made me feel so much of my life. And I feel ashamed and regret for it every time because it’s just perpetuating the same toxic cycle back, but it’s like we’ll be OK for a few weeks and then BAM shit hits the fan again. I know I need to move out, but I just want her so badly and the bf to move out and I can live alone. I miss having my space and it feeling clean, and that’s what blows my mind because I could do this, take care for my space AND work a full time M-F and even Saturdays job working 8-9+ hrs a day. I will people please and give so much to my friends, coworkers, past roommates even and family—because deep down I don’t mind and would want others to feel the same way even though it’s with unconditional love. She however has always been selfish no matter the situation. I mean just an example, we went with our mom, cousin and aunt to go dress shopping for our younger cousin and halfway through the day she just flipped her shit on me at lunch because I told her “I guess” about giving a watch to her that belonged to our recently deceased grandmother and was given to me. She called me a bitch at the table and went silent to me the rest of the trip and was being a moody child the whole car ride home with everyone feeling like they were on eggshells. She was also the same person who would whine about having to take care of our ill grandmother on a rotating schedule my mother, sister and I agreed on 5 days a week.

I feel ashamed of myself, but a part of me just wants to emotionally hurt her the way she has hurt me for many years in our lives. We have both struggled with an emotionally distant relationship with our parents on top of severe anxiety and depression. So I understand the things she’s been through in many ways just by being an older sibling and having gone through the same childhood too. But she is such an asshole to me, knows how to pick the right buttons, say the hateful things to me that she knows hurt me the most (i.e. my always fluctuating weight since 16, being bisexual, the things I like, etc.). We are both guilty in the past for lashing out emotionally, but I’ve just gotten to a point in my life where I realize she is the only person I feel this way towards. My friends and family see the good and joyous parts of me and do not judge me for who I am. But the way she sees me and treats me in our home (that we rent together) is just unbearable and pushes me to breaking points where I don’t feel like myself. She is incredibly entitled and lazy, she doesn’t have a job and lives primarily off of her boyfriend and the few sales she makes off of her painted buckets and birthday banners, but has never held down a job. I have worked since I was 17, went away and got a undergrad degree, have worked full time during that as well and lived on my own for years. I try to reason and understand what she deals with to have her in the situation she’s in, but deep down I am so frustrated by her inability to do any dishes of hers (leaves the sink full of every dish imaginable), will leave dirty clothes piled in the shared bathroom we have, leave fast food cups, bags etc all on the living room coffee table and the kitchen counter, her and the bf have boxes upon boxes of dr pepper cases and to-go pizza left in a pile in the kitchen (as if the empty space behind the fridge is for that…), and more! But then thinks a little sweeping and decorating for the holidays is a primary job when she is home ALL day with all the free time in the world. She drives me insane and also thinks it’s a travesty that I ask her and the bf to split utility bills 3-way because we all use them and it’s not fair for me to be paying more with it split 2-way. It’s just this on top of her constantly varying moods of laughter and kindness to nonchalant malaise where she can’t even have a basic conversation with me as not just her sister, but roommates too. I mean even a month into living together, her boyfriend came to while he was working on his car in the garage and said “Your sister can be so mean sometimes.” to which I had tried to validate him, but also defend my sister because I know her mood swings and ability to cut deep with words and looks. It just gets me to the point of wanting to be so spiteful to her because I feel like I can’t control myself. I want to smoke a cig in my room because I know she hates it, I want to shake all the dust on the bathroom rug on her toiletries, I want to be so fucking mean to her sometimes just to make her feel the way she has made me feel so much of my life. And I feel ashamed and regret for it every time because it’s just perpetuating the same toxic cycle back, but it’s like we’ll be OK for a few weeks and then BAM shit hits the fan again. I know I need to move out, but I just want her so badly and the bf to move out and I can live alone. I miss having my space and it feeling clean, and that’s what blows my mind because I could do this, take care for my space AND work a full time M-F and even Saturdays job working 8-9+ hrs a day. I will people please and give so much to my friends, coworkers, past roommates even and family—because deep down I don’t mind and would want others to feel the same way even though it’s with unconditional love. She however has always been selfish no matter the situation. I mean just an example, we went with our mom, cousin and aunt to go dress shopping for our younger cousin and halfway through the day she just flipped her shit on me at lunch because I told her “I guess” about giving a watch to her that belonged to our recently deceased grandmother and was given to me. She called me a bitch at the table and went silent to me the rest of the trip and was being a moody child the whole car ride home with everyone feeling like they were on eggshells. She was also the same person who would whine about having to take care of our ill grandmother on a rotating schedule my mother, sister and I agreed on 5 days a week. She was the only one who didn’t have a job and had free time to step up and help my mother who was struggling with this care of her mother when my aunt abandoned us and my grandmother from all help or involvement. But despite it all, my mother and I gave her grace even when we both worked full time also going on lunch breaks and after work to care for my grandmother.

Making friends as an adult is already hard, but social anxiety makes it feel impossible. I can’t even order food or coffee by myself. I stutter, forget words, panic, and feel stupid. I try writing things down or rehearsing in my head, but it doesn’t help, I still freeze.
The other day I called my bank, had it all planned, and still panicked. They made me go through extra security questions because I couldn’t speak properly.
It makes me feel inferior, unconfident, and trapped. I am also a very sensitive person, really empathetic and put others needs before mine. 
Yesterday, i went to a dog friendly coffee shop and my coffee arrived cold. Couldn't bring myself to tell the waiter and ended up drinking two or three sips. I am also a people pleaser with people i don't know. I am extremely nice to others but in ways that sometimes hurt me. I moved Montreal it's been a couple of years now and don't have family or close friends here. Just people i met here and there. I live with my husband and our dog, they help me a lot. But i don't have girl best friends and it sometimes sucks.

Anyone struggles with social anxiety? What worked for you?
Please don't suggest i join classes for yoga or martial arts cause i can't even handle small talks properly. And please be nice.

You bought it with the best intentions, used it once, and now it lives a lonely life in the back of a cabinet. For a long time, I thought the waffle bowl maker was destined for that same fate.

I figured it was a one-trick pony, good only for holding a couple of scoops of ice cream. But then I actually started using it. And I realized I wasn't just holding ice cream—I was holding the key to a whole new world of easy, impressive meals and desserts.

If you think a waffle bowl maker is just for making sugary cones, you're missing out on one of the most fun and versatile tools you can add to your kitchen.

## What Exactly Is a Waffle Bowl Maker?

At first glance, it looks like a tiny, specialized waffle iron. And that's not entirely wrong. But instead of a flat grid pattern, the plates have a deep, round, bowl-like shape.

You pour your batter in, close the lid, and in a few minutes, you get a perfectly formed, crispy waffle bowl. The magic is in that shape. It's a built-in edible container, just waiting to be filled with whatever you can dream up.

## More Than Just a Sugar Cone: Surprising Ways to Use Your Waffle Bowl Maker

This is where the real fun begins. Once you start thinking of your waffle bowl as a *vessel*, the possibilities are endless.

### 1. The Ultimate Chicken and Waffles Experience

Forget the fork. Forget fighting with syrup running off the plate. Make a savory waffle bowl (use your favorite buttermilk recipe, maybe with a pinch of cayenne), fill it with crispy fried chicken, and drizzle with spicy honey or maple syrup on top. It's portable, it's delicious, and it contains the glorious mess.

### 2. Hearty Breakfast Bowls to Go

Weekend mornings just got an upgrade. Make a waffle bowl and fill it with a scramble of eggs, cheese, sausage, and veggies. The waffle itself adds a nice, fluffy-carb contrast to the savory fillings. It’s a breakfast you can eat with one hand while you sip your coffee with the other.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=waffle%20bowl%20maker)

### 3. Loaded Chili or Taco Bowls

This is a game-changer for game day. Use a cornbread-style waffle batter to create a slightly sweet and savory bowl. Pile it high with chili, cheese, sour cream, and green onions. Or go the taco route with seasoned ground beef, lettuce, tomatoes, and guac. It's an edible, crispy tortilla bowl but with way more character.

### 4. Elevated Desserts Beyond Ice Cream

Sure, the classic ice cream sundae is fantastic. But what about a berry shortcake bowl? Fill your waffle bowl with fresh macerated strawberries and a dollop of whipped cream. Or a s'mores bowl, with melted chocolate, marshmallow fluff, and crushed graham crackers. The crispy waffle adds a fantastic textural element that you just don't get from a regular bowl.

---

## Pro-Tips for Waffle Bowl Perfection

Getting a perfect, crispy bowl every time isn't hard, but a few tips make a huge difference.

-   **Preheat is Not Optional.** Just like a regular waffle iron, letting it get fully hot before you pour the batter is the secret to a golden-brown, non-soggy crust. Most models have a ""ready"" light—wait for it!
-   **Grease it Right.** Even with non-stick plates, a light spray of cooking oil or a quick brush of melted butter ensures your bowl will pop out perfectly every single time.
-   **Don't Overfill.** It's tempting, but trust me. The batter will expand. Fill it about two-thirds full and close the lid gently. It will spread to fill the mold.
-   **The Crisp Factor.** For extra-crispy bowls, especially for savory dishes, let them cool and dry on a wire rack for a minute or two after cooking. This lets the steam escape and prevents sogginess.

## Is a Waffle Bowl Maker Worth It? My Honest Take

Like any specialty gadget, it comes down to your lifestyle and how you cook. If you have zero cabinet space and despise single-purpose tools, maybe it's not for you.

But if you love experimenting, hosting, or just making meals more fun, I think it's an absolute winner.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=waffle%20bowl%20maker)

It’s one of those things that makes people say, ""Wow, that's so cool!"" when you serve it. It's a conversation starter.

**Here's the one thing I wish I'd known before buying my first one:** the quality of the non-stick coating matters *a lot*. Cheaper models can stick, tear your beautiful bowls, and be a nightmare to clean. Investing in a well-built model with a durable, high-quality non-stick surface is the difference between a frustrating experience and a genuinely fun one. When the bowls slide out effortlessly and a quick wipe is all it takes to clean, you'll actually want to use it. That’s the feature that turns a gimmick into a go-to kitchen tool.

For me, it's not a uni-tasker. It's a *fun*-tasker. It's a tool for creativity, for making simple food feel special, and for solving the age-old problem of how to eat chili with your hands.

The Ultimate Guide to Machine-Washable Rugs for Effortless Cleaning,"Spilled your morning coffee? The dog tracked in mud after a rainstorm? Kids had a craft-gone-wrong moment? For most of us, these scenarios mean one thing: a dirty rug and a dreaded cleaning session.

But what if you could just strip the rug, toss it in the washing machine, and have it come out looking brand new?

It's not a dream. The world of **machine-washable rugs** has exploded, offering style, comfort, and unbelievable convenience. This guide will walk you through everything you need to know about finding and using rugs you can put in the washing machine.

## Why Go Machine-Washable? The Perks of a Low-Maintenance Rug

Before we dive into the *what* and *how*, let's talk about the *why*. Switching to a washable rug is a game-changer for your home's hygiene and your own sanity.

*   **Unbeatable Convenience:** No more renting a steam cleaner or paying for expensive professional services. Your washing machine does all the heavy lifting.
*   **Superior Hygiene:** Perfect for allergy sufferers, homes with pets, or anyone who wants a truly deep-cleaned floor. You can wash away dust mites, dander, pollen, and bacteria on a regular basis.
*   **Cost-Effective:** While the initial rug might cost the same, you'll save a significant amount of money in the long run on cleaning supplies and professional fees.
*   **Stress-Free Living:** Accidents happen. When they do, you don't have to panic about a permanent stain. Just treat it and wash it.

## What Makes a Rug Machine Washable? The Key Materials

Not all rugs are created equal. The ability to survive a machine wash cycle comes down to the materials used. Here are the most common fabrics that make **rugs you can put in the washing machine** a reality.

*   **Cotton:** The classic choice. Cotton rugs are durable, absorbent, and get softer with each wash. They're often flatweave, which helps them hold their shape.
*   **Polyester:** This synthetic hero is known for its durability and incredible stain resistance. It holds color well and dries relatively quickly, making it a fantastic option for high-traffic areas.
*   **Chenille:** Famous for its soft, plush feel. Chenille is made from cotton or a synthetic blend and is surprisingly resilient in the wash. It's perfect for adding a touch of cozy comfort to bedrooms or living rooms.
*   **Microfiber:** If you have pets, microfiber is your best friend. This ultra-fine synthetic material is exceptionally good at trapping dirt and liquids, is highly absorbent, and dries faster than almost any other material.

## Our Top Picks: Types of Rugs You Can Safely Toss in the Wash

So, what kinds of rugs should you be looking for? Here are the five types that are almost always safe for your washing machine.

### 1. Kitchen & Bath Mats
This is the obvious one. We're talking about those small, rectangular rugs with a non-slip backing. They're designed to absorb spills and be washed frequently. **Pro-tip:** Check if the backing is rubber or a more durable vinyl-like material, as rubber can crumble over time in high heat.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=rugs%20you%20can%20put%20in%20the%20washing%20machine)

### 2. Flatweave Cotton Rugs
Flatweave means the rug is woven on a loom, creating a flat, reversible surface with no pile or thickness. These rugs are lightweight, durable, and fold up easily to fit in most standard washing machines. They are the quintessential **washable rug**.

### 3. Low-Pile Polyester Rugs
""Low-pile"" simply means the fibers are short and tight. This is crucial because it prevents the rug's fibers from getting tangled or destroyed in the wash. Low-pile polyester rugs often mimic the look of more expensive wool or jute rugs but with the added benefit of being machine washable.

### 4. Boho-Style Tassled or Fringed Rugs
Many of the trendy, lightweight bohemian-style rugs you see online are made from cotton blends and are specifically designed to be washable. Their casual, relaxed look only gets better with a little bit of softening from the wash.

### 5. Reversible Rugs
Often made from cotton or polyester, reversible rugs give you two looks for the price of one. They are almost always constructed using a flatweave technique, making them lightweight and perfectly suited for machine washing.

## How to Wash a Rug in Your Machine: A Step-by-Step Guide

Okay, you've got your washable rug. Now, how do you do it *right*? Follow these steps to ensure your rug comes out clean and intact.

1.  **Check the Label (Seriously!):** Every washable rug should come with a care label. This is your bible. It will tell you the maximum water temperature and whether it can be tumble-dried. When in doubt, follow the label.
2.  **Shake It Out First:** Take the rug outside and give it a good, vigorous shake. This removes loose dirt, dust, and debris, preventing your washing machine filter from getting clogged.
3.  **Spot Treat Stains:** For stubborn stains like wine or coffee, pre-treat the area with a gentle stain remover or a mix of water and white vinegar before washing.
4.  **Use a Gentle Cycle & Cold Water:** Always err on the side of caution. Use your machine's ""Delicate"" or ""Gentle"" setting and choose cold water to prevent shrinking and color bleeding.
5.  **Choose the Right Detergent:** Use a mild, liquid laundry detergent. Avoid using bleach, as it can weaken the fibers and cause discoloration.
6.  **Drying is Key:** The best way to dry your rug is to air dry. Hang it over a clothesline or a railing (in the shade to prevent sun-fading). If you must use a dryer, only do so if the care label permits it, and use the lowest possible heat setting or an ""Air Fluff"" cycle.

## What NOT to Put in the Washing Machine

Knowing what *not* to do is just as important. Tossing the wrong rug in the wash can ruin both the rug and your washing machine. Avoid washing:

*   **Natural Fiber Rugs:** Jute, sisal, seagrass, and wool rugs will shrink, fall apart, or become misshapen when wet.
*   **Shag or High-Pile Rugs:** The long fibers will get matted and tangled, and the rug will likely be too heavy and bulky for your machine.
*   **Rugs with Latex Backing:** The latex can disintegrate in the wash, leaving a sticky mess all over your machine's drum.
*   **Anything Too Large or Heavy:** As a rule of thumb, if you struggle to carry the rug, it's probably too heavy for a standard home washing machine. Stick to rugs that are 5'x8' or smaller for the best results.

## Happy Washing!

A clean, fresh home doesn't have to be a chore. By choosing the right rugs you can put in the washing machine, you can spend less time worrying about messes and more time enjoying your space.

So go ahead, find that perfect washable rug, and live a little more fearlessly. Your washing machine has got your back.",1,1762744127.0,WashableRug,0,1.0,False

Context for those who are blocked. She posted yesterday to her stories that she “restructured our veins”. Said veins she was speaking of are VINES on the outside of her house.  Today when she was slurping up her sugar coffee, she was making a reference to veins/vines. 

She could have said my bad everyone, I’m so embarrassed about that, let’s laugh it off. But we are dealing with a zero accountability toddler.

I enjoy a vast variety of music especially City Pop, Classic Rock, Irish Punk, Harry Belafonte, Jimmy Buffet, Viza and Reggae. Three of my favorite movies are Kung Fu Hustle, Blazing Saddles, The Blues Brothers, and  Monty Python and the holy Grail.

Games I like: Borderlands 1&2, Dave the Diver, Skyrim, Yakuza 0, GTA Vice City, Sleeping Dogs, Fallout 76, Hogwarts legacy.

I chose the Sense for its GBW feature and ability to grind for filter. I usually stick with the same espresso beans for months, so the hopper and GBW convenience work well. However, it’s not easy to swap beans for the occasional decaf affogato or light roasts for pour overs. I didn’t consider this when choosing the Sense. I don’t plan on switching from it but looking for a single-dose grinder to pair with my setup for the other interests mentioned.

If I hadn’t bought the Sense, I probably would have gone with an MC6. I can’t justify another $2500 for a grinder so I have been considering the Niche Zero or Duo. I’m not a big fan of the Option-O “look” so haven’t looked at the P64 or P80 closely. The Acaia Orbit is interesting to me but reviews mention a number of varying quirks.

I have a Fellow Ode gen 2 that I currently use for filter, aero press, and cold brew. I’d like the single dose grinder I buy to replace it (if it can grind coarse enough for cold brew). Also, the few times I have ground filter using the Sense I have felt like it wasn’t able to grind coarse enough and I ended up with a large amount of chaff and fines.

tl:dr, Currently own an AllGround Sense for my daily espressos. Looking for a single dose grinder that can pair with it to handle other coffees that I don’t daily like light roasts for pour overs.",0,1762743830.0,espresso,2,0.5,False

I'm an introverted homebody with extroverted skills. I have a bachelor's degree and previously worked as a writer and editor. I'm contemplating returning to school to pursue a master's. I'm currently working towards building a soft, kind, balanced, and intentional life. 

I have been told that I'm kind, thoughtful, helpful, and smart. I like to laugh and make others laugh. I feel things deeply. I have chronic depression and ADHD, both of which I am in treatment for. I chafe at my current life, because I think all I have done so far is survive, and I want more than that. 

I am easily distracted by dogs, good coffee, and books. I like exploring where I live, visiting farmers' markets and thrift stores, going on hikes, listening to music, trying to keep my plants alive, and collecting art supplies for numerous unfinished projects. 

I'm looking for someone with whom I feel safe — enough that I can drop my mask and be me: passionate and goofy and nerdy and sometimes sad. All the multitudes within me. I want someone who will sit with me and hold my hand in both the light and the dark. 

I want to do the same with you — be your best friend, be a part of your village, be your hype-woman. Grow with you, explore life with you, badly serenade you with Spice Girls' songs, be a dog parent with you, etc.

Making friends as an adult is already hard, but social anxiety makes it feel impossible. I can’t even order food or coffee by myself. I stutter, forget words, panic, and feel stupid. I try writing things down or rehearsing in my head, but it doesn’t help, I still freeze.
The other day I called my bank, had it all planned, and still panicked. They made me go through extra security questions because I couldn’t speak properly.
It makes me feel inferior, unconfident, and trapped. I am also a very sensitive person, really empathetic and put others needs before mine. 
Yesterday, i went to a dog friendly coffee shop and my coffee arrived cold. Couldn't bring myself to tell the waiter and ended up drinking two or three sips. I am also a people pleaser with people i don't know. I am extremely nice to others but in ways that sometimes hurt me. I moved to a new country it's been three years now and don't have family or close friends here. Just people i met here and there. I live with my husband and our dog, they help me a lot. But i don't have girl best friends. It's so hard to feel overwhelmed like that.

Does anyone else struggle like this? Anything worked for you?
Please don't tell me to join a yoga or martial arts class since it's out of question being this anxious in social situations. Also, please be kind.

1ot2qaz,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ot2qaz,Updated: Review / Critique my lighting design,"I appreciated everyone's comments on the original lighting design from my contractor (baseball stadium, swiss cheese, etc! - first image). Very helpful comments.

I researched some and got another opinion from a lighting design speciality (second schematic uploaded) that I am planning on using instead of the contractor's grid. (A1) are the recesseed lights in the schematic.

I have 8ft ceilings except in the living space which is sloped 8ft-14ft.

I'm looking at the 3 inch ELK11SD-W Eclo Koto™ LED Module, 1150 lm (12.5W), Sunset 1, 2, 60° for all recessed lights (with some more narrow lens over the dining room table and high area of the living room). We are also considering the 3 inch Visual Comfort/Tech Lighting Entra CL, but it has significantly less lumens (800) with their warm-to-dim.

We have some pendant lights, sconses, and under-cabinet lights scattered around to give some layered light, but I'm still nervous we will be under-lit. We are trying to avoid floor lamps as we have very young kids that love knocking them over.

Curious if anyone has ideas around lighting the area in front of the couches which will likely be a coffee table eventually, but until then a kids play area. Right now the design has no light there to avoid glare on the TV.

Any general / specific critiques would be very helpful.

Thanks!

1ot2h4a,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ot2h4a/i_28f_feel_like_ive_hit_a_crossroads_with_my/,I (28F) feel like I’ve hit a crossroads with my boyfriend (31M).,"We’ve been together for about 9 years, since college. He’s in the arts and currently works four days a week at a coffee shop, plus teaches ome day a week and works on his art. I work a full-time corporate 9–5.

The last few years have been rough for both of us. I lost my dad at 23 and my mom at 25. He was supportive but I handled almost everything alone: working full-time, paying rent, groceries, cleaning out their house, etc. His mom is now in late-stage cancer, which has been very hard for him and his siblings.

About a year after my mom died, I told him I was ready for us to take the next step and move in together. At the last minute he backed out because he didn’t want to leave his brother and was worried about “losing creative space” with his roommates, who were all artists. I was hurt but agreed to wait another year.
We eventually did move in together into a one-bedroom and have talked about upgrading to a two-bedroom so we both have work space.

But we’ve been disagreeing on two major things:

1. Holidays and visiting his family
He’s upset that I don’t want to spend both Thanksgiving and Christmas with his family. I told him I’d like to do one holiday with him and spend the other by myself. Holidays were extremely stressful and hostile for me growing up, and I’m still grieving the fact that I’ll never have holidays with my parents again.
He interpreted this as me avoiding his sick mom. I reminded him I’ve told him I’d go see her whenever he plans something, but he says he “can’t plan” because of his schedule. I could probably be more proactive, but ultimately I’m waiting for him to tell me when to go. He suggested Thanksgiving and I agreed.
Long-term, I said it would mean a lot if we could eventually do one holiday just the two of us. He said he’s not willing to do that.

2. Finances and the future
Any time I bring up money, he gets very defensive and sometimes aggressive. He tells me I “don’t have to worry about him,” and I keep telling him that in a long-term relationship, I do. He won’t tell me what he makes or whether he has any savings (I strongly suspect he doesn’t).
I asked what his plan is if he hasn’t made meaningful progress in his art career in 10 years. He got very upset and said that if I don’t fully believe in his Plan A, I’m not supporting him. He refuses to talk about any backup plan.
I said it’s a realistic concern, and he told me I shouldn’t be worried about money “this young.” I told him I disagree and that he should be planning for the future too.

The conversation ended with him accusing me of turning his life problems into problems with him, and calling me egocentric for thinking any of it involves me.

Lately it feels like every serious conversation turns into an argument. Our lease is ending soon, and part of me wonders if that’s a sign. I don’t want to break up, but it feels like we both have major red flags the other person won’t budge on. Genuinely at a loss here.

Instructions say to pick up 100 stitches along the neckline, picking up all horizontal / vertical stitches and skipping every 3rd on the sloping parts. 

I followed this but ended up with 121 stitches with 4 more along the left shoulder side. I removed 4 from that side and now have to remove 8 stitches on each side, 116 total. 

This is my third attempt at picking up neckline stitches with this sweater. Both previous attempts resulted in puckering after I started the ribbing. The third attempt appeared to have puckering as well, but I moved to a larger (14” -> 22”) cable and it doesn’t appear to pucker the same. I still have to remove 16 stitches total.

Any insights? How does this look? Any tips for where to remove 8 stitches on each side (16 in total).

An Honest Take for Style-Loving Home Cooks,"Let's have a real chat about the Smeg kettle. You've seen it everywhere. It's the undisputed darling of kitchen Instagram, a beacon of retro cool sitting on countertops. It's beautiful, there's no doubt. But when you peel back that gorgeous pastel paint, is it a good kettle? Does it actually do its job well, or are you just paying for a pretty face?

As someone who loves a kitchen that looks as good as it functions, I was right there with you, debating the purchase. So, I did the deep dive, and I'm here to share what I've found.

## The Obvious: Why We All Want One

First, let's just acknowledge the elephant in the room. The main draw of a Smeg kettle is its design.

*   **Aesthetics:** It’s a masterpiece of mid-century modern design. The curves, the chrome accents, the range of colors—it's a piece of functional art. It can single-handedly define the vibe of a kitchen.
*   **Build Quality:** When you pick one up, it feels substantial. This isn't a flimsy piece of plastic. It has a weight and solidity that gives you confidence it's built to last.

For many people, this is enough. And that's completely valid. But let's dig into the performance.

## The Nitty-Gritty: How Does It *Actually* Perform?

This is where things get a little more nuanced. A kettle's job is to boil water, but the details matter.

### Boiling Speed and Noise

Here’s the deal: compared to many high-end, fast-boiling kettles, the Smeg is often on the slower side. It's not glacial, but if you're used to a kettle that superheats water in under a minute, you'll notice the difference.

It can also be a bit noisy. Again, not jet-engine levels, but it has a distinct, louder hum as it gets up to temperature. For some, this is a minor point. For others who make an early-morning cuppa in a quiet house, it's worth knowing.

### The Pour and the Handle

The handle is generally comfortable to hold, but the pour can be a point of contention. The spout isn't designed for precision. If you're a pour-over coffee aficionado who needs a slow, controlled stream, this might not be your kettle. For general use—filling a mug or a pot—it works just fine, but be prepared for a slightly faster, less controlled pour than you'd get from a gooseneck model.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=smeg%20kettle)

### Inside the Kettle: The Heating Element

Smeg uses a concealed heating element at the bottom of the kettle. This is good! It means there are no coils to get gunked up or to make cleaning difficult. The opening is also reasonably wide, making it easy to get a hand or brush inside for cleaning.

## A Few Things I Wish I’d Known Sooner

Whether you buy a Smeg kettle or already own one, keeping it in top shape is key to loving it long-term. Here are a couple of game-changers for any kettle owner.

> My number one frustration with any electric kettle is limescale buildup. It looks gross and can affect the taste of your water. I used to just use vinegar, but I always felt like I could never fully rinse the smell out.

Then I discovered something I wish I’d found years ago: a simple, high-quality powdered citric acid descaler. It’s a food-safe acid that demolishes limescale with zero effort. You just add a spoonful, boil, let it sit, and rinse. The kettle is sparkling clean and there's absolutely no lingering smell or taste. It's a small thing, but it makes maintaining a beautiful appliance like a Smeg so much easier and more effective.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=smeg%20kettle)

Another thought, especially for the tea and coffee obsessives out there: temperature control. A standard kettle just boils everything to 212°F (100°C). But green tea needs cooler water, and some coffees taste better off the boil. This is where a lesser-known hero comes in: the variable temperature electric kettle. While the Smeg is a style icon, a variable temp model is a performance icon. It lets you dial in the exact temperature you need for the perfect brew. If you’re passionate about your daily cup, it's a life-changing upgrade that the Smeg doesn't offer.

## The Final Verdict: So, Is It Worth It?

This all comes down to what you value most in your kitchen.

**The Smeg kettle is absolutely worth it if:**

*   Your top priority is aesthetics and having a statement piece on your counter.
*   You value a solid, sturdy feel and timeless design over cutting-edge performance.
*   You just need a reliable kettle to boil water for tea, instant oatmeal, and other basic tasks, and you're not in a huge hurry.

👉 [Click here to check the product on Amazon](https://starton.pages.dev//?q=smeg%20kettle)

**You might want to reconsider if:**

*   You are a serious tea or coffee brewer who needs temperature precision.
*   You demand the absolute fastest boiling speed possible.
*   You are on a tight budget and prioritize function over form.

At the end of the day, the Smeg kettle excels at being a beautiful, well-built object. It does its job, but it's not the fastest, quietest, or most technically advanced kettle you can buy. It’s a purchase from the heart as much as from the head. And for many of us who spend so much time in our kitchens, that's a perfectly good reason to buy something.

(Vent + desperate plea for help),"Seriously! is it just me or do all these fancy Notion templates, pretty planners and smart task apps feel like they were designed by aliens who've never experienced a single moment of executive dysfunction? I'm so, so frustrated. Every semester I buy into the hype. ""THIS time,"" I tell myself, ""I'll finally be organized! I'll track my assignments, block my time, master my to-do list! And then... it's the same old story. Like, last week I had three readings due, a lab report to start, and a presentation outline. My Notion dashboard was pristine, colourcoded, linked databases, the works. Monday morning, I was jazzed. High energy! ""I'll tackle that complex econ reading first!"" Then 20 minutes in, my brain went, SQUIRREL! Have you checked if that weird bug from your dream last night is real?"" Boom, down the rabbit hole for an hour.

Later, I tried to switch to the lab report, which should have been a breeze, but my brain was already fried from the squirrel research. So I bounced to YouTube for five minutes to reset and suddenly it's 3 AM and I've watched every documentary ever made about deep sea creatures. The econ reading is untouched, the lab report is a distant memory and the presentation outline? What presentation? That template just sat there. Another time, I had a project with multiple stages. Just break it down! they all say. So I did! Ten sub-tasks, each with a deadline. But getting started on even the first, tiny step felt like impossible. I'd stare at research topic A, feel utterly overwhelmed, and then find myself reorganizing random stuff. if there was a clear system that actually understood that feeling of paralysis, maybe I wouldn't have ended up writing a 3000-word essay in 4 hours fuelled by instant coffee and sheer panic. (I got a B+, somehow, don't ask.)

I feel like most procudtivity systems expect a consistent, linear, neurotypical approach to productivity, and my ADHD brain is just a chaotic pinball machine. They become another source of shame and a monument to my failures rather than actual tools. So, for real, what are you guys using that actually works? Like, not just try time blocking! because I've tried. What's the secret sauce for ADHD brains in college? Any specific apps, Notion setups, weird analog methods, anything?

This year, as I will be expected to provide the holiday cocktail for both Thanksgiving and Christmas, I want to bring that joy to my family. However, one of my family members is vegan and I don’t like to leave her out, so I figured I could look into a vegan version of hot hot buttered rum that could satisfy everyone. Luckily, coconut butter exists and is, of course, a no-brainer because the coconut flavor would pair so well with the remainder of my handle of Appleton Estate Signature! So off I go to my local Star Market, but unfortunately all they have is coconut oil so of course I have to take a trip to Whole Foods to get coconut butter. When I get home I do some googling for recipies only to find out that I didn't fucking need coconut butter, I needed coconut oil. Once I got back from Star Market for the second time, for shits and giggles I decided to try both the coconut butter and the coconut oil and see how they worked. The butter seemed to provide better texture and flavor than the oil, but a lot of solids precipitated out and sank to the bottom of my $1.50 Dollar Tree© Irish Coffee Mug (available in a cardboard box on the floor of a store near you!). Well, shit, I'm currently unemployed and I've seen How to Drink's hot buttered rum video, why not try fat washing the rum with coconut oil and making something with that? Well, the result had none of the butteriness of a hot buttered rum, and was more like a coconutty rum hot toddy, so I have not accomplished my mission. I have since made a dairy butter batter just for myself using a recipe posted here from u/Drinks_by_Wild and am currently about 4 hot buttered rums deep. If anyone has an idea for how I should progress in perfecting the hot coconut buttered rum, I would appreciate reading your responses tomorrow morning after downing 6 ibuprofen with my morning coffee.",2,1762742442.0,cocktails,0,1.0,False

You know the postcard shots: the Colosseum at sunset, a coin toss in the Trevi Fountain. But the real magic of the Eternal City lies beyond the lens. It's in the scent of espresso wafting from a tiny corner bar, the sound of a vespa buzzing down a cobblestone alley, and the taste of a perfectly caramelized plate of *cacio e pepe*.

This isn't just another list of tourist attractions. This is your guide to the *must-do in Rome* experiences that will turn your trip from a vacation into a memory you'll carry forever. Let's dive in.

## The Icons (Mastered, Not Just Visited)

### 1. Step Back in Time at the Colosseum *The Right Way*
The Colosseum is non-negotiable. But don't just show up and wait in a three-hour line.

*   **The Pro Move:** Book your tickets online *weeks* in advance. Choose a combo ticket that includes the Roman Forum and Palatine Hill.
*   **Insider Tip:** Start at the Palatine Hill first. It opens earlier and is less crowded. You'll get an incredible, elevated view of the Forum below, and then you can walk down through history directly into the Forum before finishing at the Colosseum. This route is chronologically correct and far less chaotic.

### 2. Experience Divine Awe in Vatican City
Visiting the Vatican Museums and St. Peter's Basilica can be overwhelming. The key is strategy.

*   **The Pro Move:** Book a ""skip-the-line"" tour for the early morning. A good guide will navigate the crowds and point out details you'd otherwise miss.
*   **Insider Tip:** After your tour, don't just leave. Go back to St. Peter's Square in the late afternoon when the tour buses have gone. The square is bathed in a golden light, and you can see Michelangelo's *Pietà* inside the Basilica with significantly fewer people. Climbing to the top of the dome is a strenuous but absolutely unforgettable must-do in Rome.

### 3. Make a Wish (and Eat a Gelato) at the Trevi Fountain
Yes, you have to do it. Toss a coin over your shoulder to ensure your return to Rome.

*   **The Pro Move:** Go very early (around 7 AM) or very late (after 10 PM) to see it without the crushing crowds. The early morning light is magical for photos.
*   **Insider Tip:** Don't just get any gelato. Walk a few streets away from the fountain to find an authentic *gelateria*. Look for signs that say *produzione artigianale* (artisanal production) and avoid the places with neon, mounded gelato. A real must-do in Rome is finding the creamiest, most flavorful gelato of your life.

## Wander, Discover, and Immerse

### 4. Get Lost in the Charming Maze of Trastevere
This is the Rome of your dreams. A neighborhood of ivy-clad buildings, winding cobblestone streets, and the best traditional restaurants in the city.

*   **The Pro Move:** Cross the Ponte Sisto at sunset. The sky glows orange over the Tiber River. Then, just wander. Let the labyrinthine streets guide you.
*   **Insider Tip:** This is the best place for your *aperitivo*. Find a bustling bar around 6 PM, order a spritz or a glass of wine, and enjoy the complimentary spread of snacks that comes with it. It’s a classic Roman ritual.

### 5. Find Serenity at the Pantheon
Walking into the Pantheon is a singular experience. The sense of space, history, and engineering genius is palpable. The oculus, the hole in the center of the dome, is a direct connection to the heavens.

*   **The Pro Move:** Entry is now free but requires a reservation. Book it on the official site a few days ahead.
*   **Insider Tip:** Go when it's raining. Standing in the dry center of the Pantheon while rain pours through the oculus is an unforgettable, almost spiritual event.

### 6. Ponder Art at Piazza Navona
Built on the site of an ancient stadium, this Baroque square is a masterpiece of public space. Its centerpiece is Bernini's magnificent Fountain of the Four Rivers.

*   **The Pro Move:** Don't just look at the big fountain. Walk around the square to see the smaller Fountain of the Moor and the Fountain of Neptune.
*   **Insider Tip:** Visit the church of Sant'Agnese in Agone on the western side of the piazza. It's free to enter and offers a stunning view and a moment of quiet away from the crowds.

### 7. Rent a Rowboat in Villa Borghese
Need a break from the intensity of the city? Escape to Rome's largest public park.

*   **The Pro Move:** Rent a rowboat on the small lake in the center of the park. It's cheesy, romantic, and offers a completely different perspective of the city.
*   **Insider Tip:** If you're an art lover, book tickets for the Borghese Gallery *months* in advance. It houses Bernini's breathtaking sculptures and Caravaggio's masterpieces in an intimate, opulent setting.

### 8. Descend into the Capuchin Crypt
For something truly unique and macabre, the Crypt of the Capuchin Friars is a must-do in Rome. The small rooms are decorated with the bones of over 4,000 Capuchin monks.

*   **The Pro Move:** It's located right under the Church of Santa Maria della Concezione dei Cappuccini on Via Veneto. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's a powerful and unforgettable reflection on mortality.

### 9. Marvel at the Mouth of Truth (*Bocca della Verità*)
Made famous by the movie *Roman Holiday*, this ancient marble disc is said to bite the hand off any liar who places it in its mouth.

*   **The Pro Move:** It's located in the portico of the Church of Santa Maria in Cosmedin. The line can look long, but it moves quickly. Have your camera ready!
*   **Insider Tip:** While you're there, explore the church itself. It has a beautiful, mosaic-filled interior and is far less crowded than the major basilicas.

## The Foodie Pilgrimage (A True Must-Do in Rome)

### 10. Master the Art of the *Caffè*
Roman coffee is a ritual. Don't order a to-go cup. Stand at the bar with the locals.

*   **The Rules:** An espresso is a *caffè*. A cappuccino is *only* for breakfast (before 11 AM). After that, it's a *caffè macchiato* (espresso with a dollop of foam).
*   **Insider Tip:** Pay first at the cash register (*la cassa*), then take your receipt to the bar (*al bancone*) to order. This is how the locals do it.

### 11. Eat Your Way Through a Roman Food Market
Head to Campo de' Fiori in the morning (it's a packed bar scene at night). While the market is a bit tourist-focused now, it's still a vibrant explosion of color, scent, and energy. For a more local vibe, try Mercato di Testaccio.

*   **The Pro Move:** Go with an empty stomach. Try fresh mozzarella, *supplì* (fried rice balls with mozzarella), and fresh fruit. It's a delicious and authentic experience.

### 12. Devour the Four Holy Dishes of Roman Cuisine
You cannot leave Rome without trying its signature pasta dishes. Find a traditional *trattoria* in Trastevere or Testaccio and order:
*   ***Carbonara***: Egg, Pecorino Romano cheese, guanciale (cured pork jowl), and black pepper. No cream!
*   ***Cacio e Pepe***: ""Cheese and Pepper."" Simple, yet incredibly difficult to perfect.
*   ***Amatriciana***: Tomato, guanciale, Pecorino Romano, and onion.
*   ***Gricia***: The ancestor of Carbonara—guanciale and Pecorino Romano.

👉 [Find the Best Flights & for Your Next Trip](https://govacation.pages.dev//?q=must%20do%20in%20rome)

### 13. Indulge in *Carciofi alla Romana* (Roman-Style Artichokes)
When in season (spring), artichokes are a local obsession. Try them two ways:
*   ***Alla Giudia***: Deep-fried until crispy and delicious. A Jewish-Roman specialty.
*   ***Alla Romana***: Braised with mint and garlic, incredibly tender and savory.

### 14. Do the *Aperitivo* Like a Roman
As mentioned before, this pre-dinner ritual is a cornerstone of Roman social life. It’s more than just a drink; it’s a light meal and a chance to unwind.

*   **The Pro Move:** Find a busy spot in a neighborhood like Monti or Trastevere between 6 PM and 8 PM. Order a Negroni or a spritz and enjoy the buffet. You’ll often pay one price for the drink and the snacks.

### 15. Hunt for the Best View of the City
Rome is stunning from above. The dome of St. Peter's is one option, but for something different, try these:
*   **Aventine Keyhole:** Peer through the keyhole of the Priory of the Knights of Malta on the Aventine Hill for a perfectly framed view of St. Peter's dome. It's magical and free.

Morristown?,"Hey there. I'm a single 30 y/o guy, working remotely. I've moved between a few states, currently living near Charlotte NC. A good chunk of my friend group is spread between NYC, Philly, Hoboken, Jersey City -- so I'm interested in making a move back to NJ.

Around that area, I used to live:

* UES in Manhattan - I liked the walkability, but with a small apartment, it felt a bit cramped
* Jersey City - maybe I was living in the wrong area, I didn't like JC at all. I felt it was loud, dirty, congested, and stressful to get in/out of.

I'm looking for:

* a walkable downtown (bars, restaurants, coffee shops, parks)
* not super crowded/dense (not Hoboken or JC)
* people in their 20s/30s, dating scene
* preferably on a NJTransit train line -- reasonably easy access to NYC and Newark Airport, and to a lesser extent Philly
* budget of $3-3.5k for a 1br, may buy a home in a few years
* I have a car, it'd be nice if driving places isn't an absolute nightmare

I'm considering... Morristown, Red Bank, Somerville, Asbury Park, Princeton, Montclair, Hackensack. But really open to anywhere that might be a good fit!

Any suggestions or input is appreciated, thanks.",6,1762742198.0,MovingtoNewJersey,34,0.71,False

No more drama, no more fights, just peaceful days and quiet nights

1ot29bz,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1ot29bz/anyone_else_hate_customer_service_practices_lately/,Anyone else hate customer service practices lately?,"This specifically applies to in-cafe orders, not drive through which is a different animal and is actually probably helped by the new ""efficient"" interactions.

Note that I'm not blaming employees, I know the interaction is by design from Starbucks and not the employees fault.

If you think I sound like a Karen hear me out...This is not about entitlement, it's about changing the natural exchange to be awkward, and not predictable, for the sake of efficiency. It seems minor, but the whole thing is awkward from start to finish. Every. Single. Time. While paying $5-$10 for a grande drink, in an unpleasant cafe.

How customer service should work: the interaction starts *when you get to the counter* (or whenever you're in reasonable range to the exchange), and *at that point you* *greet* each other in some way, a smile, hello, how are you etc. *Then* you state your order/they ask what they can get you.

Instead, employees shout hello right when you open the door. Sounds like a fine idea, but I'm not expecting it from that far away, or while they're doing another task and don't even look up at you. You can't even tell who it came from, especially with loud music, and it'd be weird to shout across the store anyways to acknowledge them back. So the whole thing is just awkward and makes me feel impolite. I've also seen some customers complain about hearing the constant ""hellos"" while in the cafe.

Then, since they've already ""acknowledged"" you with that ""hello"" (even if it was several minutes ago, which is a long time in this scenario), they not only abruptly start the ordering interaction with ""what can I get you?,"" with no greeting/acknowledgment, not even a smile (which is hard to blame underpaid employees for), they ask it when I'm still a good 10 feet away from the counter. It sounds trivial, but I'm just not expecting it or mentally prepared to spout off my order because I'm anticipating exchanging greetings and starting once I get to the counter, rather than from 10 feet away. The same way I've done it for 20-30 years at every establishment. And once again, I don't want to shout, so I don't reply with my order until I reach the counter, which by then the employee has been staring at me and waiting expectantly for several paces, adding to the awkwardness.

This is merely the tipping point for me to stop going, on top of all the other issues of high prices, too much ice, upcharges, employee treatment, bad coffee, going out of their way to make the cafe as uncomfortable as possible to be in. Otherwise I wouldn't even mention this. Over the past 15 years I've gone from hanging out/meeting friends, getting tasty drinks in the cafe at a mildly premium price, to ordering the most basic coffee to stay cheap (which often tastes burnt), and exiting the cafe as soon as possible because it's designed to be unpleasant and keep you moving, or just using the drive through. If the customer service sucks too, it's the final straw.

So is it just me? Or have you noticed this? Any employees want to chime in?",5,1762742115.0,starbucks,2,0.86,False

**Chapter 1**

James had never committed a crime before. He searched the bottom of his backpack until he felt a pair of wire snips. Heart pounding, he put the blades around the thick wire of a chain-link fence, took a deep breath, and squeezed until his hand shook. It snapped so loudly that he jumped back and peaked over a bush to scan the park for witnesses. With no one in sight, he got back to work. 

The sun would rise soon so he quickly made five more cuts in a vertical line and squeezed through the flap. The woods were dark, but James moved down the trail with ease. After passing a paper birch, he slowed his pace to check a thin thread he had stretched across the trail, giving a sigh of relief to see that it was unbroken. He stepped over the thread, rounded a corner, and there it was: a wooden treehouse tucked safely in the branches of a giant maple tree.

James ran up to the tree to give it a hug before stopping himself and settling for a pat on its rough bark. He wasn't sure if it would still be intact after Suncorp, a secretive new company, bought up all the remaining forest outside his small Ohio town and sealed it behind a barbed-wire-topped-fence. It had been a miserable month for him and his friend, Maggie, as they sat on the swings wondering what was happening deep in the woods on the other side. Heavy machinery pounded and strange smells that many described as “violent” would often drift out. He couldn’t wait to tell her that they had a way in and that Operation Surveillance could officially begin.

James walked over to a neighboring tree and pulled a hidden line. A rope ladder unraveled and stopped just before hitting the ground. He climbed the swaying ladder up to the treehouse and poked his head inside. It was intruder-free, so he pulled himself up and lit an oil lamp on the table.

Everything appeared to be as he left it: two of every dish sat neatly in the cabinet, his stack of drawings was still jammed in a cubby, and several playing cards were still strewn about from Maggie throwing her cards up in celebration after a win. Even the *No Trespassing* sign he snatched from a tree before the fence was built was still in the wood stove, ready to be burned.  

James checked his watch and kept moving. A ladder in the corner took him through a hinged opening and onto the roof. He pulled two cameras out of his backpack and screwed them to opposite corners, pointing down at the ground below. He ran the wires back into the house to a tape-covered cookie tin with an antenna sticking out of the top. A flick of a switch turned on a little green light.

“That should do it,” he said with a smile. “We’re watching you now.”

He wished it hadn’t come to cutting fences and setting up cameras, but he couldn’t imagine losing the treehouse forever. He started building it as a place to escape when his dad went missing on an arctic job assignment. Working on it helped keep his mind busy as search parties came back empty-handed. Every detail held a memory; from the window boxes he made at home with his mother to the chimney crafted with his dad’s old coffee cans. With any luck, the network of cameras he was putting up would record Suncorp breaking the law and get them shut down for good.

After one last look around, he blew out the lamp, slung his backpack over his shoulders and closed up the treehouse. James found the faint trail that lead him deeper toward the pounding machines. Ferns brushed against his ankles as he rushed past mature oaks and hickories that towered to the canopy above. The sun began to warm the eastern sky, turning the woods from black to gray. He picked up his pace but skidded to a stop after seeing a large white animal disappear behind a shrub ahead. 

He crouched down and stared into the understory. Eyes wide, James took a few steps closer. The woods were silent aside from Suncorp’s machines, so he gasped when he turned around and saw a barefooted, shirtless boy standing on the trail next to a frost-white coyote. James nearly took off running, but they did not make any moves. James stayed put and studied the wild-looking boy and coyote who both scanned at him with just as much curiosity.

""Hi,"" James eventually said to break the silence.

A hint of a smile pulled at the corner of the boy's lips, but he did not speak.

“Are you with Suncorp?” James asked.

The boy did not like this question and took a step back while the coyote stared at him with piercing blue eyes.  

""Wait! Don’t go!” James pleaded.

The boy paused. A sharp metallic grinding sound reverberated through the trees, causing the boy to wince.  

“I don’t like them either,” James said. “I don’t know what they’re up to, but it can’t be good. I’m going to film them and if they do anything shady, I’ll send it out to every news station in the area.”

The coyote kept its eyes locked on James while the boy looked deep in thought.

“What is that? Over your shoulder,” James asked, pointing to a vine with large black flower buds slung across his chest like a sash. “I’ve never seen any plant like that.""

The boy looked down at his chest and picked one of the bulbs from the vine. He held it between his finger and thumb for James to see. James stepped forward to get a better look, but the boy released the flower from his fingers, letting it fall to the ground.

The flower hit the ground and exploded with a blinding light that left behind a cloud of black smoke. James fell backward onto the ground. He squinted and rubbed away the bright afterimage, only to find that the boy was gone. In a flash, he had vanished into thin air along with the puff of smoke. Feeling uneasy, he turned around and saw the boy standing behind him, coyote at his side.

""What was that!?"" James shouted

The boy smiled.

""Ha ha, very funny,"" James said, blushing. ""Where did you even come from?”

The boy thought for a moment and reached into a pouch that hung at his hip and pulled out a shiny brown seed the size of an acorn. He held the seed in his palm, wrapped his fingers around it, and squeezed until his hand trembled. James watched in amazement as tiny, thread-like roots grew through the cracks of his fingers and dangled below. A green stem shot up between two of his fingers, sprouting leaves and a feathery purple blossom as it grew. The boy opened his hand to expose a bundle of roots sitting on his palm with an exotic-looking flower that bobbed around on its stem. He held it out for James to take.

James hesitated but then carefully took the flower from his hand. The delicate petals spiraled outward form a central hole that seemed to swallow all light. He held it to his nose for a sniff and was immediately transported to a misty swamp below a rocky waterfall. An unusual bird with black and yellow stripes was drinking the nectar of the same type of purple flower he held in his hand. After drinking its fill, the bird flew off to the window of a house built in the canopy of the boggy forest.

""What the—How did--- Is this where you live?"" James asked as the vision faded.

He opened his eyes, expecting to see the boy standing before him, proud and amused, but there was no one there. No poof of smoke, no blinding light. Just James, the flower, and two bouncing ferns. James ran to the ferns, but the boy was long gone. He wondered if he should chase after him but at this point it was fully light out so he had to get back to the fence. ",1,1762741685.0,fantasywriters,0,1.0,False

Im a 29 f. I am 5'8 Iranian. So growing up in Iran i feel like men would always be intimidated by my height. I've never really fell  for any guy and never had a relationship because I just never felt anything for any Iranian guy. Like sure I had guy friends and had a few show interest but I never felt a connection to turn it into something more. 
Then i moved to states and boom i feel like i get along with men here way more. Like I can connect to men here more for some reason. But the problem here is most men are just looking for hookups and are pretty good at being players. Its hard to tell if a guy is genuinely interested. I went on two dates and we'd been talking but when i met the guy i felt he was just pushing to take me to bed. Like there was no mood or vibe and he kissed me out of nowhere. It was my first ever kiss and it was so bland. I felt nothing. I feel bad rhat my first ever kiss had to be that way. I've never experienced a guy do anything sweet and nice for me. That concept is so alien to me. When we went for coffee he insisted on paying even though I wanted to get something to eat with coffee out of politeness I just went with coffee. He then had dinner and I told him I wasn't hungry and ended up just sharing a slice of pizza that he got for himself. Lol. I don't want to be a burden on anyone either but at the same time I crave that someone would be genuine towards me and show the old school kinda love. Like ive had so many talking stages and they fail because either the guy has no goals and wants to obsess over me or either the guy is emotionally unavailable or wants to bang me. There's never that perfect balance. Like I just want someone with goals, who can communicate well with me and we can push each other to do well in life but that seems like too much to ask for. I consider myself a good person who has a kind heart. I would say im fairly decent looking. I don't like playing games and people say you gotta not be available or act a certain way for men to like you and I find it fake. Why not be open about how much you like someone? I feel like I'll die alone. I want love and family but here im at the age of 29 without ever even getting a flower from a guy LMAO",1,1762741555.0,Advice,6,1.0,False

Her first peck. Her first time. Her first everything. But the next morning, he announced his relationship to her stepsister.
""I wanted to be the one to say it. Isabella and I are officially together.""
Lilith's body went still. Her heart stopped.
Her mouth opened, but no sound came out.
Below her, in the open foyer, she saw them.
Daemon. Dressed. Clean-shaven. Steady.
Isabella. Wrapped around his arm like satin ribbon. Smiling like she'd already won.
He didn't glance up the stairs.
He didn't remember.
The same lips that had whispered Lilith's name last night now curled into a smile for her stepsister.
Lilith stepped back, slowly.
One step. Then another.
No one noticed.
No one saw her - not even the man who had been inside her just hours ago. 
Not even the man she gave her firsts to.
____________
 
""Mr. Volkov, welcome back.""
The housekeeper bowed slightly as the tall man entered the Salvatore estate, flanked by two guards and Isabella, whose laugh echoed like it owned the space.
Daemon Volkov didn't laugh.
He never did.
He surveyed the place with sharp, calculating eyes - cold, arctic blue - as if already mapping every exit, every threat. He hadn't set foot here in six years. Not since-
""Mother!"" Isabella chirped, flinging herself into her mother's arms. ""I told you he'd come. He had meetings in London, but I convinced him to visit before flying to Moscow.""
Her mother gushed. Her father - Lance Salvatore - smiled stiffly.
Daemon said nothing.
He took a seat like a king - coat still on, gloves removed with silent efficiency. His presence alone shifted the atmosphere.
And then-
Footsteps.
Soft. Unhurried.
A figure entered the room - curves in silk, a storm of dark curls falling down her back, presence calm but... arresting.
Daemon didn't look up at first. But when he did, something in his gaze froze.
""Ah,"" Lance stood quickly, a flicker of unease flashing across his face. ""This is-""
""Lilith,"" said the girl, offering no handshake.
Daemon's eyes snapped to her.
Lilith.
He hadn't heard that name in years.
Not since-
His jaw tightened.
Isabella let out a nervous laugh. ""Oh, right. You two used to play together when we were kids. Crazy, huh?""
Lilith tilted her head. ""We weren't playing.""
That voice.
He remembered it - quieter, younger, always trailing behind. Always looking up at him like he was something divine.
But this?
This version of her was dangerous. Stunning. Indifferent.
She didn't look like a girl anymore.
""Lilith,"" he repeated slowly. ""You've changed.""
She arched an eyebrow. ""People tend to.""
""I almost didn't recognize you.""
""You didn't,"" she replied coolly. ""It's alright. I wouldn't recognize me either.""
He studied her - the dress, the eyes, the way she stood like she belonged in a painting no one was allowed to touch.
Untouchable. Unbothered. Unapologetic.
""I remember you now,"" he murmured, eyes never leaving her face.
""Do you?"" she asked, voice featherlight.
""Yes."" A pause. ""You used to follow us around.""
Isabella snorted. ""She was obsessed with you.""
Lilith's smile didn't reach her eyes. ""Isn't it funny, what we grow out of?""
The tension thickened.
Lance cleared his throat. ""Lilith, don't be rude-""
""I'm not."" She met Daemon's gaze. ""I'm just... honest now.""
Isabella clung to his arm. ""Anyway, we're engaged. Isn't it perfect?""
Lilith blinked slowly. ""Absolutely poetic.""
Daemon's gaze didn't leave her for a second.
There was something wrong. Off. That quiet girl he remembered - she wasn't there anymore.
And this woman...
This woman didn't flinch under his stare.
She didn't look at him with longing.
She didn't look at him like he mattered.
And for some reason...
That infuriated him.
 
Daemon
""Lilith,"" he murmured again, as if the name would steady something inside him.
It didn't.
She was gone - silk vanishing up the stairs, leaving only silence and the faintest echo of heels on marble. But the weight of her presence remained.
Heavy. Disruptive.
Like a storm pretending to be still air.
Beside him, Isabella talked too loudly. Smiled too widely. Her hand curled around his forearm like a claim. He barely felt it.
""She's always like that now,"" she said, half-laughing. ""Cold. Weird. I think she likes being difficult.""
He didn't answer.
""I told you she changed,"" Isabella went on. ""She thinks being quiet makes her mysterious. Honestly, she's probably just jealous. She was always jealous of me.""
Daemon's jaw ticked once.
""Right,"" he said absently, eyes still on the staircase.
Isabella didn't notice the flatness in his tone. She never did.
He should have been focused on the business dinner he'd flown in for. On the engagement announcement. On the deal he was closing with Lance.
But all he could see were those eyes - that exact blue that once watched him from shadows. Eyes that used to glow with hope.
Now?
Now they were empty.
Dead calm.
She didn't look at him like he was worth remembering.
And that?
That bothered him.
---
Lilith
Her door closed behind her with a soft click.
Silence.
Not peace. Just the kind of quiet that settles over ruins.
Lilith walked across her room with steady, effortless grace, like a woman used to keeping her emotions chained so deep no one could hear them scream.
She peeled the silk dress from her shoulders, not delicately. She wasn't delicate.
She wasn't anything anymore.
She tossed it on the chair, pulled on an old oversized tee, and sat at the edge of the bed - back straight, eyes forward.
Blank.
She didn't cry.
She hadn't cried in years.
Not for Daemon Volkov.
Not for the girl she used to be.
She didn't wear that dress for him. She hadn't even known he'd be in the country until this morning. And even if she had...
It wouldn't have changed a thing.
He meant nothing now.
Nothing.
Just another man in a suit, mistaking silence for weakness. Mistaking her for someone soft.
She rested her elbows on her knees, fingers laced together. Breathing.
Still.
Unmoved.
The girl who once waited for him was dead.
And Lilith didn't mourn her.
 
The dining room gleamed with polished silver, tall candles, and uncomfortable tension.
Lilith walked in without announcement, without performance - wearing a simple black satin dress that clung to her body like it was born there. No jewelry. No effort. Just skin and silk and silence.
She didn't smile. She didn't speak. She took her seat - directly across from Daemon - and poured herself a glass of wine without waiting for anyone to offer.
Daemon's eyes followed every movement.
She didn't spare him a glance.
At the head of the table, Lance stood, lifting his wineglass.
""We wanted to wait until we were all together,"" he began, voice tight with pride, ""to share the good news.""
Lilith didn't blink.
Isabella leaned into Daemon with a bright, too-wide smile. ""We're engaged!""
Gasps. Cheers. Her mother's dramatic flutter of hands.
Lilith raised her glass lazily, not even bothering to fake a smile.
""Cute,"" she muttered.
The table hesitated - unsure whether it was sarcasm or approval.
It was sarcasm.
Daemon's eyes narrowed, studying her like a puzzle with a piece missing.
""You don't seem surprised,"" he said, voice low.
""I'm not.""
""You don't seem happy either.""
Lilith sipped her wine, still not looking at him. ""I'm dressed, aren't I?""
Isabella's smile twitched. ""She's always like this,"" she said through her teeth. ""Ignore her.""
""Ignore me harder,"" Lilith murmured.
Lance shot her a look. ""Lilith-""
""Didn't say a word,"" she cut in, her voice cool as the silverware.
Daemon leaned back in his chair, eyes fixed on her like a trigger waiting to be pulled. ""You used to have more to say.""
Lilith finally looked at him - slow, sharp, and dangerous.
""And you used to matter.""
A silence fell like glass shattering.
Daemon's jaw clenched once.
Isabella laughed nervously. ""She's joking-""
""No,"" Lilith said, finishing her wine. ""I'm not.""
She stood up, calm and detached, her chair scraping softly against the floor.
""If the engagement's the main course, I've had my fill.""
And without waiting for permission, she walked out - satin trailing behind her like a warning.
Daemon didn't move.
But his knuckles were white against the glass.
 
But then he didn't think.
He moved.
The moment Lilith left the table, Daemon was on his feet - not for Isabella, not for appearances, not for pride.
For her.
And it wasn't because he loved her.
He was sure he didn't.
Lilith had once been his friend - a quiet shadow behind him, harmless, constant. But now... she was someone else. And it shook him.
He didn't understand how she'd changed so much in six years.
So he followed her.
Down the corridor that used to be warm and golden, full of light and laughter. Once lined with ridiculous childhood portraits and flowers in vases.
Now, it was dark. Silent. Lifeless.
Just like her eyes.
His footsteps were quiet over the marble floor, breath tight in his throat.
She didn't turn.
Didn't slow.
Didn't acknowledge him.
And for reasons he couldn't explain, that wrecked him more than anything.
She wasn't walking away to make him chase her.
She walked because she knew he wouldn't matter enough to stop her.
But still-he followed.
Her bedroom door was nearly closed when he caught it.
He pushed it open.
Stepped inside.
---
She didn't flinch.
Lilith stood at her vanity, slowly removing an earring, back to him. One bare shoulder catching the low light. That black satin dress clung to her like it was painted on - effortless, lethal.
She didn't look at him. Didn't move any faster.
""Let me guess,"" she said flatly. ""You forgot something.""
He said nothing.
Her eyes met his in the mirror. Cold. Unbothered. A face carved from still, expensive marble.
""You walked out,"" he said finally.
""I got bored.""
The words were like a slap dressed in silk.
His chest tightened. ""You're trying to get a reaction.""
She turned to face him, slow and deliberate - not like she was afraid, but like she was bored of the idea of being chased.
""No,"" she said, her voice low. ""If I wanted a reaction, I'd be in your lap. Not your memory.""
His jaw clenched.
""You used to smile when you saw me.""
""You used to deserve it.""
His hands curled into fists at his sides.
""You've changed.""
""Thank God."" Her tone didn't waver. ""Can you imagine if I was still pathetic enough to beg for scraps at your table?""
He took a step forward. ""I didn't know what I was doing.""
""I was eighteen."" Her voice cut clean. ""You knew exactly what you were doing.""
Silence.
She didn't fill it. She let it rot.
Daemon's voice dropped, rough and low. ""You think I don't regret it?""
Lilith let out a soft, breathless laugh - not amused, just done.
""No,"" she said. ""I think you regret being seen. Because now I see you clearly. And I feel absolutely nothing.""
That word.
Nothing.
It gutted him more than hatred ever could.
She walked past him, her shoulder grazing his arm with cruel indifference. That faint, familiar scent on her skin - vanilla and storm - burned through him like poison.
He caught her wrist.
Not hard.
But desperate.
""Why are you like this now?"" he asked.
She looked down at his hand like it was a stain. Then she met his eyes - not with anger, but emptiness.
""I'm like this,"" she whispered, ""because the girl who loved you died six years ago.""
She pulled her wrist free with ease.
""Don't follow me again.""
She opened the door.
But Daemon didn't move.
He couldn't.
Because all he could see now - behind his eyes, behind his ribs - was that night.
 
Six Years Ago
The night was quiet when Daemon left the party.
Not silent - he could still hear laughter echoing from the Salvatore estate next door. Laughter that didn't include him anymore. Laughter that belonged to her.
Isabella.
She had been glowing all night - fluttering around in a soft pink dress, surrounded by friends and gifts and cameras. Every second was about her. Every smile. Every photo. Every candle.
No one mentioned that it was Lilith's birthday too.
No one remembered that the girl who lived under the same roof, who had been born just minutes before Isabella, was now eighteen.
He had forgotten, too.
Until now.
Until he saw her - outside, alone, curled on the back patio of her father's house, knees hugged to her chest, a nearly empty bottle of wine between her bare feet.
Daemon stopped when he saw her, something in him stalling. Breaking.
""Lilith.""
She didn't turn right away.
When she did, her eyes were calm - too calm.
""Hey,"" she said softly.
""You drinking alone?""
""Looks like it.""
He hesitated.
""Come over?"" His voice cracked in that last word, and he cleared it quickly. ""I... I don't want to be alone.""
She blinked. ""Everything okay?""
He shook his head.
And she nodded once - stood - and followed him.
---
Daemon's place was dim, shadowed in moonlight and silence. Familiar to her. Foreign now.
He poured whiskey for both of them.
They sat on the couch without speaking.
""She pecked someone else,"" he muttered eventually. ""At her party.""
Lilith raised an eyebrow. ""Isabella?""
He nodded. ""Said it was a dare. But it didn't look like a dare.""
She didn't say I told you so. Didn't smirk.
She just sipped her drink and let the quiet sit with them.
Daemon glanced at her. ""Why weren't you at the party?""
She gave a soft laugh - one that didn't reach her eyes. ""Because it wasn't mine.""
He froze.
Lilith tilted her head, voice light, detached. ""You know we share a birthday, right?""
Guilt hit him like a slap.
""I'm sorry. I didn't-""
""It's fine."" She sipped again. ""Doesn't really count when no one notices you're missing.""
He stared at her now - really stared. The t-shirt clinging to her frame was old, probably borrowed from her father's closet. Her curls were half-pulled back, still a little damp. No makeup. No effort.
And yet she looked...
Undeniably beautiful.
Real. Unreachable.
""You look different,"" he murmured.
She shrugged. ""I'm older.""
""You're eighteen,"" he repeated, like the word mattered more now.
She nodded, quiet. ""Today.""
He rubbed his face. ""God.""
She laughed softly. ""That's twice now.""
Daemon stood up, walked to the bar. ""You spilled a little,"" he said over his shoulder, noticing the wine stain on her shirt.
""Of course I did."" She sighed, rising. ""Do you mind if I-?""
""Go grab something from my room,"" he cut in gently. ""Top drawer. T-shirt or whatever.""
She blinked, surprised.
He held her gaze. ""Please. Just... make yourself comfortable.""
---
She returned ten minutes later.
Barefoot.
Fresh-faced.
Wearing his black t-shirt - long enough to brush her thighs, fitted enough to make him forget how to breathe.
She sat beside him again like nothing had changed.
But everything had.
""You know,"" she whispered, ""I used to think you were untouchable.""
He turned to her, stunned.
""That day we met,"" she went on. ""My mom had just died. I was eight. I was in the backyard crying over Sunny - that stupid yellow bear my nana made by accident.""
""I remember,"" he said quietly. ""You wouldn't let go of it.""
""You gave me candy,"" she said. ""You made me laugh. And from that moment, I was yours.""
Daemon's throat tightened.
""For a long time,"" she continued, voice barely a breath, ""I thought... maybe if I stayed close, long enough, you'd see me. Really see me.""
He stared at her.
""You were my first friend. My first everything.""
She met his eyes. Steady. Bare.
""My first love.""
Daemon didn't move.
""I know you loved her,"" Lilith said. ""I know I wasn't easy to love. I was loud. Rough. Not... soft like her.""
""Lilith-"" His voice broke.
But she didn't let him speak.
""I'm not saying this to guilt you. I'm saying it because tonight? I don't want to lie anymore.""
And then she whispered, ""I don't want to be alone.""
He moved before he thought.
His hand reached out, curling around her wrist, then her waist, pulling her in like a wave he didn't know he was drowning in.
Their lips met - tentative at first. Searching.
Then all at once.
She gasped when he lifted her into his lap, her legs wrapping around him like instinct. He pecked her deeper, fingers tangled in her hair, pressing her closer like he was trying to remember what she felt like before he lost her completely.
""Tell me to stop,"" he whispered against her lips.
She shook her head. ""Don't.""
He stood, carrying her with him, eyes locked on hers. He walked them to the bedroom, laid her down with aching care - as if the weight of what they were doing hadn't truly hit him until her back touched the sheets.
""You've done this before?"" he asked, voice thick.
She blinked once. Then, quietly: ""No.""
He froze.
His jaw clenched.
She reached up, brushing a thumb across his cheek. ""I want it to be you.""
A sound escaped him - soft, broken. Reverent.
When he pecked her again, it wasn't hungry. It was everything.
He touched her like she'd never been touched before.
Because she hadn't.
She arched under him, breath catching as his mouth explored her skin like it was sacred. She trembled when he entered her, and he slowed - whispered her name like a promise.
He held her hand.
He held all of her.
And when she cried - just a little, just once - he pecked her tears away like it would somehow make this right.
But it wouldn't.
Because in the morning, she would learn the truth.
And so would he.
 
Lilith
Six Years Ago
She woke to stillness.
A golden beam of morning light stretched across her thigh, warm and slow. The scent of clean sheets and something deeper - wood, cologne, him - clung to the air like the ghost of last night.
She blinked against the light.
The room was unfamiliar. Sleek. Masculine. Quiet.
His bedroom.
For a moment, she didn't move.
She lay still in his bed, wearing nothing but his black t-shirt, and listened to the soft hush of silence, the thud of her own pulse. Her muscles ached - not painfully, just... differently. Her thighs. Her hips. Her ribs.
She turned her head.
The space beside her was empty. Still warm.
Daemon had been there. Not long ago.
And now he was gone.
She smiled, a small, shaky thing.
Maybe he was downstairs. Making coffee.
Maybe he'd left to grab something and would be back soon.
Her heart fluttered, soft and foolish, still na茂ve enough to believe that last night meant something.
She stretched once and sat up - and froze.
There it was.
A faint bloom of red on the sheets beneath her.
Her heart skipped.
Not from shame. From something older. Deeper.
She hadn't expected to bleed. She hadn't expected... this.
Her first.
She clutched the edge of the sheet, staring at it.
Her first peck.
Her first time.
Her first everything.
She swallowed hard, chest tight, and quietly pulled the sheets off the bed. She folded them gently, carefully - like someone trying to erase evidence of a crime.
She didn't want him to see the blood.
She didn't want him to know just how much it had meant to her.
---
Lilith found the linen closet in the hallway - of course she knew where it was; she used to run through this house like it belonged to her too. Back when they were kids. Back when he saw her as something soft. Something safe.
She replaced the sheets, smoothed them out, tucked the corners in tight.
Then, barefoot and hopeful, she padded down the stairs.
That's when she heard it.
Voices.
Laughter.
Not casual - celebratory.
Her father's voice, bright and formal. ""We're thrilled. Truly. It's been a long time coming.""
Her brows pulled together.
She moved closer to the railing at the top of the stairs.
Then she heard Daemon's voice.
""I wanted to be the one to say it. Isabella and I are officially together. And she'll be joining me in England next week - just a few meetings, nothing dramatic.""
Lilith's body went still.
Her heart stopped.
Her mouth opened, but no sound came out.
Below her, in the open foyer, she saw them.
Daemon.
Dressed. Clean-shaven. Steady.
Isabella.
Wrapped around his arm like satin ribbon. Smiling like she'd already won.
He didn't look conflicted.
He didn't glance up the stairs.
He didn't remember.
The same lips that had whispered Lilith's name last night now curled into a smile for her stepsister.
Lilith stepped back, slowly.
One step. Then another.
The floor didn't creak.
No one noticed.
No one saw her - not even the man who had been inside her just hours ago.
Not even the man she gave her firsts to.
She turned.
Walked back down the hall.
Slipped out the back door of his house like a secret.
She didn't cry.
She didn't collapse.
She just walked.
Across the narrow patch of grass separating his house from hers. Back through her back door. Up the stairs.
Into the bathroom.
She stood under scalding water, fully clothed, until she couldn't feel her fingers anymore.
---
She never said a word.
Not about the blood.
Not about the sheets.
Not about how she'd thought - even just for a moment - that maybe she mattered.
Because that morning proved what the last six years had been trying to teach her:
She was forgettable.
She was a mistake.
She was nothing.
And the girl who loved Daemon Volkov?
