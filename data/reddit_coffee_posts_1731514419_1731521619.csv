This is my list of ever-evolving TBI life hacks that I started a few years ago. Please feel free to share any other tips or resources you‚Äôve found on your own journey.

Share the Love: TBI Tips and Tricks

‚Ä¢	‚Å†cold showers for improved circulation and inflammation reduction (I typically start with a hot shower and just slowly move it colder throughout until it‚Äôs completely cold by the end)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Brain injury alliance (US organization with tons of small local chapters and resources)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Adaptive sports (look up ‚Äòadaptive sports near me‚Äô for local groups of other active, handicapable people trying to get out)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Hope Survives podcast (TBI focused podcast covering a wide range of topics, available wherever you listen)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†LoveYourBrain (TBI virtual support groups & free US retreats)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Brain food. Adjust your diet to incorporate naturally beneficial foods like anti inflammatory items such as certain berries, Mediterranean diet foods, coffee, nuts, etc.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Vocational rehabilitation services (Available in local and state chapters. Services provided can include resume help, job finding services, etc)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Brain injury ID card. (Brainlaw.com - can take about 8 weeks to receive)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Practice mindfulness by doing yoga. Stay as present as possible. No living in the past.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Preboard for flights (I have only ever tested Delta, American Airlines, and Southwest, but evidently most airlines will allow you to preboard for a flight if you have a TBI. I always go to the flight desk upon arriving to the gate and ask directly. ‚ÄúHello, I have a traumatic brain injury. Can I please preboard the flight?‚Äù I have never been denied.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Academic accommodations (if you are interested in returning to school following a TBI, reach out to your school‚Äôs Student Disability Services. You have a legitimate disability. You can still learn, but learning may look a little different now. SDS can get you the accommodations you need to be successful in your classes. This might look like the professor providing you with notes, more time to complete exams or projects, a private, quiet testing space away from the distracting large classroom environment with other test takers fidgeting, rustling papers, clicking their pens, or clearing their throats.)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Love to read but can‚Äôt remember anything you just read when you get to the end of a paragraph?! SAME. Welcome to the world of Audiobooks. Audible is a great audiobook app but can get expensive if you consume a lot. Overdrive & Libby apps are both library based apps that allow you to ‚Äòcheck out‚Äô tablet and audiobooks for free. Spotify also offers plans that include audiobooks for certain memberships.
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Self care apps: Ten percent happier meditation, sanvello, insight timer, Balance (all come with in-app purchases)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Adaptive pass for skiing (cheaper. If you are still an active skier and/or snowboarder, research your mountain or ski pass of choice‚Äôs ADAPTIVE pass. This is especially true for major ski passes like ICON or EPIC. They have significantly more affordable season passes available for those of us who are a little damaged but still want to do it again! You can thank me later.)
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Adaptive US America The Beautiful LIFETIME National Parks Pass (you read that right. You can get a lifetime pass to America‚Äôs National AND State Parks just for hitting your head! AMAZING! I have one. This is not a drill. It‚Äôs kind of annoying because you have to actually submit documentation stating you have a permanent disability, but that‚Äôs it. I now have a Lifetime Pass. Highly recommend.)
‚Ä¢     Make the LISTS, REMINDERS, CALENDAR, and ALARM apps on your phone your new favorites. Maybe even group them together as ‚Äòessentials.‚Äô Whatever. Just make sure you have easy, quick access to these super simple tools that 99% of us already have right at our fingertips. Can‚Äôt remember to water your plants that used to be your babies?! Set a weekly reminder. Can‚Äôt keep track of birthdays, anniversaries, or your appointments that used to be burned on the inside of your skull.. or do you regularly show up at the wrong time or place or in the wrong day? Prioritize putting EVERYTHING, even the little things like ‚Äúcall granny‚Äù, on your calendar with alerts set to announce events ahead of time and when it‚Äôs time to actually leave for that event.
‚Ä¢     Do yourself a favor and MAKE LISTS. What you are reading right now is literally a list from my phone that was copied and pasted in to this post because I have a TBI, needed to remember all of these simple little life changes to make my existence not so freaking hard, and thus, I wrote everything down and constantly add to it so I have a guide to reference, OR SHARE (you‚Äôre welcome).

1gqjds1,https://i.redd.it/c8f781wdmp0e1.jpeg,Day 1: Daily Dunkin‚Äô Donuts Coffee Review ‚Äì Inconsistent Espresso Chronicles ,"Alright, so here it is ‚Äì I‚Äôm starting my daily review of Dunkin‚Äô coffee. Yep, I get one every day, and every day, without fail, it‚Äôs a different experience. Some days it‚Äôs amazing, other days‚Ä¶ not so much. This is my new outlet to rant, complain, and maybe just connect with other Dunkin‚Äô diehards who know the struggle. Will I get banned or reported eventually? Probably. But hey, here goes nothing.

Today‚Äôs drink: Ice Macchiato. I went in aiming for French vanilla, but somehow ended up with caramel. Let me break down what‚Äôs going on:

1. Preparation: Dunkin‚Äô makes their ice macchiatos with whole milk and flavoring first, then layers espresso on top. They‚Äôre not mixed together initially. The proper way to drink it is to move the straw from the espresso layer down into the milk and flavoring before sipping. Personally, I find this process a hassle and rarely bother with it.


2. Why I Choose Macchiatos: I order macchiatos specifically because they‚Äôre supposed to have more espresso, making them stronger than a latte. However, the inconsistency is maddening. Some days my macchiato is as light as a latte, and other days, I get a latte that‚Äôs as dark and bold as a macchiato should be. It‚Äôs frustrating because macchiatos are meant to have that extra espresso kick without being a full-on espresso shot to the face or a milky latte. It‚Äôs all about that balance, but Dunkin‚Äô seems to miss the mark often.


3. Espresso Quality: Today‚Äôs espresso tasted kind of watery. It‚Äôs not like they just added a few drops of espresso to the milk; it feels like the espresso shot itself is weak. When I picked up my macchiato, the espresso layer looked watery and see-through, not rich and dark like it should be. This makes me think there might be an issue with the espresso machine. In the past, after the espresso machine was serviced, the shots tasted chef‚Äôs kiss ‚Äì smooth, bold, almost like a Starbucks ristretto shot. But lately, it‚Äôs been more watered down, both in appearance and taste.


4. Sweetness: I added three pumps of caramel, which should be sweet enough. However, it seems like the amount of caramel varies because some days it‚Äôs perfectly sweet, and other days it falls flat. Maybe each barista has their own interpretation of a ‚Äúpump,‚Äù but it adds to the inconsistency.



Overall: This drink is‚Ä¶ passable. Not great, not terrible. It could definitely be better. And this isn‚Äôt me throwing shade at the employees ‚Äì I get it, it‚Äôs a busy job. This is just my coffee journey, hoping other Dunkin‚Äô regulars might feel me on the inconsistency.

So, this is Day 1. Expect me back for Day 2.


---

Edit: Just to clarify a few things about the ice macchiato process:

Layering: The whole milk and flavoring are poured first, followed by the espresso on top. They‚Äôre not mixed, which is why the espresso floats on top unless stirred.

Drinking Method: Ideally, you should move the straw from the espresso layer down into the milk and flavoring before sipping to get the balanced taste. I usually skip this step because it‚Äôs inconvenient, but it‚Äôs supposed to enhance the flavor experience.

Espresso Consistency: The main issue is that the espresso often tastes watery and looks less rich than it should. It‚Äôs not just about the amount of espresso but the quality of the shot itself, which seems off lately.


Just wanted to add these details to better explain the inconsistencies I‚Äôm experiencing. Thanks for reading!

I was at my usual coffee shop this morning. It‚Äôs my go to spot I know the baristas, recognize the regulars, and they know me too. Pretty standard stuff. I ordered my usual, found my corner seat, opened my laptop, and started working. About ten minutes in, a guy sat down at the table across from me. Not unusual. What was unusual was that he looked exactly like me. I don‚Äôt mean oh, he sort of looked like me. I mean, this guy could have been my identical twin. Same haircut, same beard, same basic clothes, right down to the hoodie and jeans combo. Even the laptop was identical, with the same model and stickers. I was trying not to stare, but at some point, he looked up and met my eyes. He tilted his head, kind of smiled, and it was like he knew what I was thinking. Now, I actually do have a twin brother, but he lives across the country, and we were texting last night there‚Äôs no way it was him. I was just sitting there, trying to process it, thinking maybe it was some wild coincidence or prank. I got up to use the restroom, and when I stood, this guy stood up at the exact same moment, almost like we were synced. He even did the same little oops sorry nod when we made eye contact. We both sort of froze, and he gave me this look, like he was amused. Then he sat back down, and I just walked to the bathroom, trying to shake it off. When I came back, he was gone, but my coffee cup was empty, and there was a receipt with my name on it sitting on the table. It was written in handwriting that looked eerily like mine. I know I hadn‚Äôt left a receipt there I hadn‚Äôt even gotten a receipt for my order. It made no sense. After that, I tried to go back to work, but every so often I‚Äôd see someone walk past the coffee shop window who looked like me. At one point, I swear I saw two of me‚Äôs walking by. They had my same jacket, my bag, everything. They looked in through the window, right at me, before walking off. It was like they were in sync. I actually stood up and went to the window to see where they went, but they were already gone. I started to feel like I was in a movie or something, like this couldn‚Äôt actually be happening. At this point, I started to question if I was dreaming. I even went to the bathroom again and stared at myself in the mirror, half expecting not to see my reflection. I can‚Äôt tell you how surreal it was. On my way out, I heard someone call my name. I turned around and saw an older guy sitting in a booth in the corner, watching me with this‚Ä¶ kind of sad, knowing smile. He just said, ‚ÄúNot yet.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what he meant, and when I asked him if we knew each other, he shook his head and went back to his coffee. I stood there for a second, feeling totally creeped out, before heading out the door. I practically ran home and haven‚Äôt been able to shake the feeling that something‚Äôs off. Has anyone else had something like this happen? I know the glitch in the matrix thing is kind of a meme, but I can‚Äôt shake this. Seeing myself? Multiple versions of myself? And then the older guy?

I really enjoy learning new things (currently trying to learn French so lessons very welcome) and love to travel (although who doesn‚Äôt I suppose). I like more traditional relationship dynamics as I do have quite a strong personality but I think respect and autonomy are important.

After helping hundreds of people overcome their social fears and anxiety, I discovered something that most ""social skills advice"" completely misses.

Think about it - how many times have you:

* Been told to ""just be confident""
* Tried forcing yourself to be more social
* Practiced conversation ""techniques""
* Read endless tips about body language
* Pushed yourself out of your comfort zone

And yet... nothing really changed. Maybe you had moments of feeling better, but then fell right back into the same patterns.

Why?

Because all these methods focus on the OUTSIDE, when the real cause of social anxiety is on the INSIDE.

‚Äé

# The Hidden Truth About Social Anxiety

The reality is - social anxiety isn't actually about ""lack of social skills"" or ""not knowing what to say.""

It's about RESISTANCE (wanting for things to be different than the way they are).

Your brain is designed to protect you from pain and danger. And it does this based on what it has learned through past experiences (your beliefs and memories).

Think back to your early experiences:

* That time you said something ""wrong"" and everyone laughed
* When you felt rejected or excluded
* Times you were judged or criticized
* Moments you felt ""not good enough""

Each of these experiences created a memory in your subconscious mind. A belief about what social situations mean.

Now, years later... whenever you're in a social situation, your mind remembers all those painful associations. And begins to create anxiety to protect you from potential pain.

This is why you:

* Overthink what to say
* Worry about being judged
* Feel your mind going blank
* Get physical anxiety symptoms
* Avoid social situations

Your mind is trying to move you away from what it perceives as danger.

‚Äé

# Why Most Social Advice Fails

Most social skills advice completely misses this crucial point.

They tell you to:

* Practice small talk
* Use eye contact
* Work on body language
* Push through the fear
* Use conversation techniques

But here's the problem - if you have limiting beliefs about social situations being painful or dangerous... your subconscious mind will ALWAYS create resistance.

It's like trying to drive with the handbrake on. You can push the gas pedal harder (force yourself to be social), but you'll never drive smoothly until you release the brake (change the limiting beliefs).

‚Äé

# The Real Solution: Transforming Your Beliefs

I've helped hundreds of people completely transform their social anxiety by addressing the root cause - their limiting beliefs.

One of my students had such severe anxiety he couldn't even order coffee. After we changed his limiting beliefs around social situations... within 30 days he was comfortably speaking in meetings, connecting with new people, even giving presentations.

The key is understanding that you have limiting beliefs about:

* Not being good enough
* Being judged
* Making mistakes
* Speaking up not being safe
* Not belonging
* Being different/weird

These beliefs create your social anxiety... influence your thoughts... drive your emotions... and determine your actions.

‚Äé

# How Beliefs Control Everything

Your beliefs shape:

1. Your Perceptions:

* How you interpret social situations
* What you notice about others' reactions
* How you think others see you

1. Your Emotions:

* Anxiety levels in social situations
* How comfortable you feel expressing yourself
* Your emotional reactions to others

1. Your Actions:

* What you say and do
* How naturally you express yourself
* Whether you avoid or engage socially

1. Your Results:

* The connections you create
* How others respond to you
* Your social experiences

‚Äé

# The Process of Transformation

Here's the step-by-step process to permanently transform social anxiety:

**1. Identify Your Limiting Beliefs**

* Notice what thoughts come up in social situations
* What do you fear might happen?
* What painful memories come to mind?
* What do you believe about yourself socially?

**2. Find Evidence Against These Beliefs**

* Look for times you were social without anxiety
* Moments you connected easily with others
* Times you expressed yourself naturally
* Situations where you felt comfortable

**3. Create New Evidence Daily**

* Focus on positive social experiences
* Notice when interactions go well
* Collect proof that contradicts old beliefs
* Build new positive associations

**4. Reinforce for 21-30 Days**

* Review your evidence daily
* Keep collecting new positive proof
* Let your mind build new neural pathways
* Allow the old beliefs to fade

‚Äé

# What Actually Changes

When you transform these limiting beliefs, something amazing happens:

\- Words flow naturally without overthinking

\- You stop worrying about judgment

\- Physical anxiety symptoms disappear

\- You feel free to be yourself

\- Others respond to you differently

\- Social situations become enjoyable

Why? Because you've removed the invisible barriers in your mind.

You're no longer fighting against subconscious resistance. You're aligned - wanting to connect AND feeling safe to do so.

‚Äé

# The Social Skills Part

Once you've changed those limiting beliefs, certain social skills become natural:

**1. Authentic Expression**

* Say what you actually think
* Share how you really feel
* Express your genuine opinions
* Be comfortable with your personality

**2. Natural Connection**

* Listen without anxiety
* Respond spontaneously
* Share relevant experiences
* Build on conversations naturally

**3. Confident Presence**

* Maintain comfortable eye contact
* Speak with natural volume
* Have relaxed body language
* Take up appropriate space

These aren't ""techniques"" you have to practice. They flow naturally when you're not fighting against limiting beliefs.

‚Äé

# Common Mistakes to Avoid

**1. Don't try to ""fake it till you make it""**

* This creates more internal conflict
* Your subconscious mind knows it's fake
* Others can sense the incongruence

**2. Don't force yourself to be more social**

* This reinforces that it's not natural
* Creates more resistance
* Builds negative associations

**3. Don't judge yourself for having anxiety**

* This creates more limiting beliefs
* Adds another layer of resistance
* Makes transformation harder

‚Äé

# The Path Forward

The reality is - you were born socially free. Watch any child... they express themselves naturally without fear.

Your social anxiety came from experiences that created limiting beliefs. Change those beliefs... and you return to your natural state of social freedom.

Remember - you're not broken and you don't lack social skills. You just have some old programming that needs to be updated.

When you transform those limiting beliefs, everything else falls into place naturally.",2,1731520612.0,socialskills,0,1.0,False

1gqixzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t2/comments/1gqixzi/what_do_i_eat_to_increase_blood_sugar_a_little/,What do I eat to increase blood sugar a little? ,"I was in the hospital 4.5 months ago with a BS of 420 and an 11.6 A1C. I have been diabetic for years and knew what to do, just chose not to. Got my A1C down to 6.6 a month ago by following a strict keto/low carb diet with 500mg metformin ER and 20mg of Lantis. 3.5 weeks ago after went back to Dr for new A1C and because of 6.6 number, we took the next step and I went on Mounjaro (2.5), reduced the Lantis to 15mg and increased the Metformin ER to 1000 due to waking up with a BS in the 160s. New combo is working great and now waking in the lower 100s. Today, my CGM wakes me to tell me I am low (58). I get up and check my blood to confirm and it‚Äôs really in the 80‚Äôs. Sitting here now with a cup of coffee hours later and I am still in the 80s. I am thinking I should probably start increasing my carb intake. At least until my Dr‚Äôs appt on Monday when obviously I should probably go lower on the metformin and/or Lantis since the Mounjaro is a game changer.  The problem is, I don‚Äôt know what to eat to get my numbers up a little. I don‚Äôt want to mess up my A1C progress. I am so used to eating low carb, I don‚Äôt know how to add a little back in!

She is very aggressive about her credit card and always wants to pay for my share. Even in situations when it makes no sense. (Examples: She tries to pay for my coffee when we are in line. She has asked to pay for my flights.) She doesn't even ask me at all if I want her to pay - she just puts her card down. If I get up to go to the bathroom, an expensive meal is already paid. I am sick of her making points off of me because 1) I want to build my own credit and get points. 2) it is unhelpful for me to track my budget when I am hit with a ton of Venmos. This is a personal preference and isn't how I like to manage my money. 

We have a trip coming up and I am now kind of dreading it for this reason. How can I politely communicate to her that I cannot have her paying for everything? She is very sensitive and passive-aggressive so it is difficult to have conversations with her. Any solutions and advice would be greatly appreciated.",2,1731520342.0,Advice,10,1.0,False

Walking away was forced upon me.

I found this subreddit after the pandemic. And I was relieved. Between 2016 and 2022. All dissenting opionions on the left were met with, not just debate, but vitriol. This wasn't just left to places like Reddit, which I used to think was the home of individualism. But if you used any dating app you were constantly being honey-potted into engaging with people who's sole agenda was to impose their left-wing rhetoric upon you and threaten to dox you for disagreeing.

I won't stay on that phenomenon. But I feel the need to illustrate again, how disillusioning it is being a black person in America, and having some white girl on the internet aggressively talking down to me about social justice when I initially was under the impression she engaged because she wanted to grab coffee.

Distancing. There's something cringe about social justice advocating from the ü§≥üèø.

I have to touch on my header title. 

It was because of a date I went on with someone from okcupid. Anyone remember okcupid was the one and only dating website where people would display facets of their personality and creative inner-child? I'm on a date with this woman, fall of 2015. And I'm laughing about how Trump has no chance to win the election next year. But I was telling her that I didn't know who, running for president, was going to represent the things I valued as a young person. And that's the first time I heard the name Bernie Sanders. I'll never forget her passing me her weed bowl and talking with so much enthusiasm about this guy. A guy that she informed me she went to Rallys for, and had volunteered to do some advocating for. We never had a second date but I give her credit for sparking my curiosity. What was so electric about this guy?

Eventually I discovered who he was later on. Instantly I was a fan. The only candidate I had seen demanding livable wages and lower healthcare costs. As a young man with a job as a low-wage dishwasher and several teeth I couldn't afford to get looked at by a dentist, this was my favorite candidate to follow up Obama. It made sense. And I noticed even though I was late to the Bernie Sanders crowd, he had a massive following. I was relieved.

Then the next year, Hillary, with zero excitement or enthusiasm from the young vote, was elected as the Democrat nominee. And I felt abandoned. Every where I could find, young people wanted Bernie Sanders. When I talked to my friends, they all wanted Bernie Sanders. I never heard one person in real life prior to her nominee election say that she was the one they were rooting for. But prior to that I had heard or read from many people that they were crazy for Bernie and the discussion for livable wages. Hillary made no distinction if she was for change or status quo, no where I looked.

Forget about the fact her running is nepotism. She offered no uplifting message and no enthusiasm.

They, the DNC, continued that pattern behavior by swapping out Bernie for Biden in 2020. Again! Another candidate that's riding on name recognition instead of a candidate speaking to what people want and need to survive.

Sadly the Republican party has taken advantage of the disenfranchised class that's been left at all of our different bus stops waiting for jobs and affordable consumables. 

I'm not a conservative. I didn't even vote for Donald. But I'm happy he won because now Democrats are going to get a chance to get their shit together so the next cycle they will finally have to listen and incentivize voters instead of alienating.",1,1731520254.0,walkaway,1,1.0,False
1gqiv2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/tirzepatidecompound/comments/1gqiv2u/46f_tirzepatide_slower_weight_loss_than_expected/,46F - Tirzepatide - Slower Weight Loss Than Expected -  Advice?,"Hi everyone,

I'm a 46-year-old woman who started Tirzepatide 55 days ago. I'm feeling a bit discouraged by my slow progress. I've lost 11 pounds (155 lbs -> 144 lbs), which I know is a good start, but I was hoping for more by this point.

I've been taking the shot weekly as directed (ranging from 4 days to 10 days in between, depending on when I start to feel hungry) and my appetite is significantly reduced. I did try increasing the dosage a couple of weeks ago, but it caused nausea, so I'm going back to the original dose for my next shot.

While the weight loss is slower than I'd like, I do feel much better overall. No more bloating, my concentration is better, and I don't have constant cravings.

Here's what a typical day looks like for me:

* Breakfast: Black coffee
* Lunch: Scrambled eggs with veggies
* Afternoon snacks: Protein shake (24g protein), Greek yogurt (14g protein)
* Dinner: Usually skip it, or have something very light (like a small bowl of veggie chili)

Exercise:

* 2-mile walk every morning
* Weight training 2-3 times per week (trying to increase this, but the nausea and low energy have been a challenge lately)

I'm wondering if my lack of more significant weight loss could be related to my age, my diet, or my exercise routine. Any advice or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated!",0,1731520247.0,tirzepatidecompound,7,0.2,False
1gqiuwz,https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1gqiuwz/trip_report_a_week_in_london/,Trip report: A week in London!,"I posted here a couple months ago asking for advice on my first trip to London.[Here is a link](https://www.reddit.com/r/LondonTravel/comments/1f235km/please_critique_my_tentative_solo_london_itinerary/) to the post for anyone interested.

My trip was amazing, and I definitely utilized the advice I got here! I went into a lot of detail about my travel style and preferences in the previous post, but just to summarize: Female early 30s, like to wander and explore neighborhoods, don't really like churches or nightlife, vegetarian. I like to mix up my meals with market food, some nicer or unique restaurants, and local chains. I also LOVE checking out local grocery stores, and this trip did not disappoint!

* Day Zero (Saturday)
   * I landed at Heathrow around 1 pm. Set up my esim and navigated to the Elizabeth Line pretty easily. Citymapper was an absolute must for this trip - I used it everyday for all kinds of public transit.
   * Transferred to a bus at Paddington to get to my hotel (normally is accessible by the underground but there was planned maintenance that closed the station closest to my hotel for the first couple days I was there). I ended up at Paddington a lot this trip and it was not my favorite lol, just very big and busy.
   * Checked in at the[ London House Hotel](https://www.londonhousehotels.com/). Overall this hotel was fine and fit my needs - good location, clean, not expensive. The only real downside was that the walls were very thin. I could hear everything happening in the hallway outside my room. This didn't end up being a big issue other than one night where I was woken up by some loud people in the hallway.
   * After getting situated at the hotel I went out to explore! Notting Hill is so cute, I loved the whole vibe. I went to the Portobello Road Market, but pretty quickly moved to quieter side streets as it was too overwhelming in my sleep-deprived state (spoiler I ended up going back later.)
   * Had an early dinner at[ Rosa's Thai](https://rosasthai.com/), which was lovely. At this point I was ready to crash so I went back to the hotel for the night.
* Day One (Sunday)
   * I got up nice and early to get in a full day of sightseeing! I started with a coffee and pastry from[ Blank Street](https://www.blankstreet.com/), both of which were great.
   * I took my coffee to go and had a long meandering walk through Hyde Park. Absolutely loved this, it was so beautiful and peaceful in the morning - that is, until I started noticing more and more groups of runners starting to congregate. Turns out this was the day of the Royal Parks half marathon! I think this particular area of Hyde Park was the start of the race. The running route was all through Westminster, so I kept coming across it as I made my way around. This was slightly annoying as certain crosswalks were blocked off, but because it was so early the race hadn't actually started yet. This meant no cars and no runners, so I was able to stand in the middle of the road and get some nice pictures. Eventually the race did start, and it was actually really fun to watch for a bit and see everyone cheering for the runners.
   * I went from Hyde Park to Buckingham Palace, then walked down the mall to Trafalgar Square. From there I went down Parliament Street hoping to spot Larry the cat at 10 Downing (no luck). Took some pictures and admired Big Ben and Westminster Abbey.
   * I crossed Westminster Bridge and took my time walking along the south side of the Thames. I timed this so that I ended up at Borough Market right after it opened - no lines! I spent a long time looking at everything before getting the mushroom risotto, which was so good! At this point it was getting busier so I found a curb on the edge of the market to sit and eat.
   * After eating and just chilling for a bit I went to the London Bridge City pier to catch an uber boat to Greenwich! I bought my one-way ticket using the ThamesClippers app, but I think you could just do contactless tap like the underground(?). The boat was nice, it felt good to sit lol. The ride to Greenwich was not long, maybe 20 or 25 minutes? That could be wrong but it was definitely not long.
   * I walked up the hill through Greenwich Park and checked out the Royal Observatory, which was very cool (if you're into that kind of thing). I spent a decent amount of time looking at everything, and then spent like an hour and a half sitting in the cafe because I needed a break.
   * I then wandered around Greenwich with no real aim. It's such a lovely place! I ended up at the Greenwich Market, and checked out some of the chain shops - Waterstones, Boots, etc. I know this probably seems funny to those in the UK but I just find it so interesting to see how they differ from my usual stores!
   * This was also my first Marks & Spencer experience and you guys, I get the hype. I wanted to buy so much of the food. I decided to try some classics so I got a bag of Percy Pigs and some mini Colin the Caterpillars. Don't hate me - I didn't love the Percy Pigs. They were fine, but I've never been into gummy candy. I do love chocolate, so Colin was my favorite of the two.
   * Finally, I went to have Sunday roast at[ Richard the First](https://www.richardthefirst.co.uk/)! I chose this pub specifically because it had good reviews of its vegetarian Sunday roast. Everyone was friendly and I was served quickly. The food was great and I'm happy I got to try something (somewhat) traditional!
   * I took the DLR back into Central and then switched to the underground. I knew nothing about the DLR but it came up on Citymapper as the quickest option back so I went with it. I love when cities have lots of transit options!
* Day Two (Monday)
   * This was the only day I had to deal with some bad weather, which I know was pretty lucky. It did cause me to rearrange some plans but it wasn't a big deal.
   * I had an amazing breakfast at[ Tab x Tab](https://tabxtab.com/). I got the grilled halloumi, poached eggs and avocado on toast, which I highly recommend. I took my time here and had a couple lattes as it was raining and I wasn't in a hurry.
   * I used the rain as an excuse to check out Waitrose and Tesco. My biggest takeaway: the meal deals!!! I knew about them already but it was different to see in person. So many options! I also love how there's so many ""meal for two"" dinner specials. Also, Heinz has a much more expansive set of products than I ever knew about. Who knew Heinz made pasta sauces? Not me.
   * It was still raining so I decided to postpone my original plan of walking along the mini Venice canals and instead went to[ Daunt Books](https://dauntbooks.co.uk/) in Marylebone. This is a must for book lovers, I really enjoyed it!
   * The weather had calmed down a bit so I took the tube up to Hampstead to explore. I can totally understand why people recommended Hampstead, it was picturesque! I wish the weather had been better so I could spend more time wandering around. I did have a lovely afternoon pastry and coffee at[ Heath Street Bakehouse](https://www.heathstreetbakehouse.com/).
   * I then walked over to the heath, and made my way up Parliament Hill to check out the view. It was all so beautiful and again, I would've spent more time here with better weather.
   * I took the bus into Kentish Town to get a late lunch at[ Queen of Sheba](https://www.thequeenofsheba.co.uk/). This was a recommendation I got from my previous post and it was great! Ethiopian food was new to me and I really enjoyed it.
   * From here I went back to the hotel to chill for a couple hours, then get ready for my evening plan, which was seeing Book of Mormon! This was one of the best experiences of the trip, it was such a great performance. It was at Prince of Wales Theater, which was small enough that even my seat in one of the last rows had a great view.
   * I ended up not having dinner this day as I was still full from the late lunch. However, I didn't know about the West End tradition of ice cream at intermission! I couldn't pass that up.
* Day Three (Tuesday)
   * I originally had this day set as a day trip in my itinerary, but I decided I needed more time in London.
   * I started the day at[ Layla Bakery](https://laylabakery.com/) for a coffee and pastry. This place is so cute! Probably my favorite bakery of the trip. They had just reopened with their fall menu and I got a pumpkin and manchego cheese pastry - amazing!
   * I did some more wandering around Notting Hill and admiring the cute houses. I also ordered some empanadas from[ De Nadas Empanadas](https://denadas.co.uk/) to go so I could take them to my next destination, Richmond!
   * The tube out to Richmond was a little more complicated, I had to get off and cross the street to a different station(?), but still on the District line. Again, Citymapper made this easy and I had no problems.
   * I'm a Ted Lasso fan so I was excited to see Richmond. I went out to the Richmond Green and ate my empanadas on one of the park benches.
   * Someone on the Ted Lasso sub put together a self-guided walking tour that hit a bunch of the filming spots, so I used that as a guide. It was a beautiful walk around such a cute little place! I also hung out at the riverside for a while which was nice, but I did have to deal with a drunk guy who wouldn't leave me alone. This is pretty par for the course as a solo female traveller but still annoying.
   * I dipped as soon as I could and went to[ Kiss the Hippo](https://kissthehippo.com/) for an afternoon coffee. From there I went to the Ted Lasso souvenir shop, and finished up with a gelato at[ Gelateria Danieli](https://www.gelateriadanieli.com/).
   * I made my way back to the hotel and accidentally took a nap, lol. It was time for dinner by then so I pulled myself together and went to[ Govinda's](https://govindas.london/?gad_source=1) in Soho. I was looking forward to this as the reviews online were great. The food lived up to the hype, delicious and cheap. However the restaurant itself was packed and very warm, so overall pretty uncomfortable. I ate quickly so I could escape the heat. I ended the night just walking around Soho. Even on a Tuesday night the streets were crowded and I found it pretty overwhelming. I went back to the hotel and ate some Colin the Caterpillars for dessert.
* Day Four (Wednesday)
   * Started the day with a coffee and pastry at[ Gail's](https://gails.com/?srsltid=AfmBOorS5m0kOpHcRlS0IxuZDPAQsafyFd8tGk7C5xpWzHGdQyB8niDe). I then took the tube out to Tower Hill. I was a bit early for my Tower of London reservation so I walked along the river a bit and just admired the view.
   * I did the free Yeoman Warder tour to start, which was great! Definitely recommend. I then explored everything else on my own, which I think took a couple hours. I found all the history interesting, but I imagine someone more into it than me would take more time.
   * It was roughly noon when I left the Tower of London, so I walked to[ Roti King](https://rotiking.com/food-drink/) for lunch. Wow, this place was amazing! So simple, just roti and dahl, and so so good. Also, where has milo been all my life?!
   * I walked around Spitalfields Market for a while, just checking everything out. I then went to the[ Brick Lane Vintage Market](https://www.vintage-market.co.uk/), which I really enjoyed! I bought a sweater and some candles.
   * I then walked over to[ Horizon 22](https://horizon22.co.uk/). I booked my ticket ahead of time but I'm not sure how necessary that was. The view was beautiful and I enjoyed it. It was a bit crowded but the space was big enough that it didn't really matter.
   * I was tired of walking at this point so just went back down to the river and sat for a while, just people watching. I also got an ice cream from a cart outside the Tower of London but I can't remember what it was called!
   * I then made my way over to[ Tayyabs](https://www.tayyabs.co.uk/) for dinner. So so so good, highly recommend! I wished I was with more people so we could order more and share everything.
   * Back to the hotel for the night, finished off the Colin the Caterpillars.
* Day Five (Thursday)
   * This was my day trip! I booked a tour of some of the Cotswolds and Oxford through[ London Walks](https://www.walks.com/). Most of their walks are for a few hours around various areas of London, but they have some longer trips that go outside the city as well. This was a nice break for me from planning and navigating. I had a great time, even though most of the others on the tour were in couples or groups.
   * We went to Minster Lovell and Burford in the morning and Oxford in the afternoon. I'd love to go back and see more of the Cotswolds. I'm really glad I took a day to see more of England outside of London.
   * On the train home I placed an order at the[ Pizza Pilgrims](https://www.pizzapilgrims.co.uk/) near my hotel. Picked it up on my way back and had a hotel room feast (something I consider a must on vacation).
* Day Six (Friday)
   * This was my last day, and I didn't have any real plans. I went to[ Arome Bakery](https://www.instagram.com/aromebakerylondon/?hl=en) for breakfast and got probably the prettiest pastry I've ever had (chocolate and pistachio escargot). I think it has to be a tie between Arome and Layla for best bakery of the trip.
   * I then walked through Regent's Park and walked for a bit along the canals like I had planned to earlier. It was a very misty and quiet morning which made for a lovely walk.
   * I then went to check out Camden Market. I can understand why people think its too touristy and commercialized, but I still enjoyed walking around. Also got the craziest masala fries from[ Funky Chips](https://funky-chips.com/)! I didn't know before going but I guess this place has gotten pretty popular on tiktok. I can understand why, the portions were huge and I still ate almost all of it.
   * From here I decided to go back to Hyde Park, since I enjoyed it so much earlier. I also went to Tesco for a candy haul (a truly embarrassing amount of candy). Afterwards I went back to the hotel to get a head start on packing up all my stuff and to chill for a bit.
   * I then went back to truly check out the Portobello Road Market. It was crowded but definitely worth it, I loved looking at everything! I bought a print from a local artist, which is something I try to get everywhere I go.
   * I had a reservation this night to have dinner at[ Dishoom](https://www.dishoom.com/). It was delicious and the atmosphere was great (I went to the Kensington location). Again, wished I was with more people so I could've tried more things.
   * From Dishoom I walked to[ Oddono's](http://www.oddonos.com/) for some truly great gelato (on par with what I've had in Italy).
* Day Seven (Saturday)
   * I checked out of the hotel and booked a taxi to St. Pancras using the Freenow app, which worked really well. Definitely recommend if you're planning to use taxis in London.

And that was my trip! I know I didn't hit a lot of the usual museums and galleries, but they just weren't my top priority. When I go back (and I will someday!) I'll check some of them out. There was just so much to do and see! Public transit was amazing and made everything so accessible.

I know this is a massive post, but I hope it helps someone else planning a London trip, just like the other posts I found here did for me!

1gqiud3,https://www.reddit.com/r/remotework/comments/1gqiud3/oh_how_remote_work_has_changed_the_modern/,"Oh, how remote work has changed the modern workplace","For those who haven‚Äôt been following the shift over the past few decades, working remotely today has transformed in ways that both challenge and liberate the traditional office setup. Here‚Äôs a look at what remote work has come to mean and how it compares to the more ‚Äútraditional‚Äù office life some of us may remember:



‚Ä¢ **Flexibility of Location? Sort of‚Ä¶**

The promise of ‚Äúwork from anywhere‚Äù sounds liberating, but the reality is often ‚Äúwork from home‚Äù or a nearby caf√©. While many envisioned remote work as an opportunity to travel, Wi-Fi speed, time zones, and setup constraints mean that most remote workers are more tethered to their home offices than the travel lifestyle originally hyped.

‚Ä¢ **Communication: A Double-Edged Sword**

Tools like Slack, Zoom, and Teams let us communicate instantly, but they can also create a sense of constant surveillance. Remote work requires constant ‚Äúvisibility,‚Äù which means answering emails quickly, attending back-to-back video calls, and always being ‚Äúon,‚Äù even if you‚Äôre working alone in your own home.

‚Ä¢ **Boundaries Blur**

In an office, leaving at 5 PM often meant the workday was truly over. Now, work and home life are a lot harder to separate. It‚Äôs common for remote employees to feel like they‚Äôre ‚Äúliving at work‚Äù instead of ‚Äúworking from home.‚Äù The kitchen becomes the breakroom, the living room becomes the conference room, and personal time becomes ever more elusive.

‚Ä¢ **No More Commute (But Also No More Breaks)**

Sure, we‚Äôre no longer spending hours on the road, but those commutes were actually built-in ‚Äútransition‚Äù times. They allowed a mental shift from home to work, and back again. Now, it‚Äôs all too easy to roll out of bed and directly into work, blurring those boundaries even more.

‚Ä¢ **Less Social Connection**

Working remotely can be isolating. Gone are the impromptu coffee chats, the small talk in the elevator, or team lunches. While some people prefer the solitude, it‚Äôs clear that working remotely has minimized the chance for organic social interaction, which, ironically, is a key ingredient for feeling connected to a team and a company.

‚Ä¢ **The Home Office Reality**

Not everyone has a perfect setup at home. Many remote workers lack a dedicated office space, ergonomic furniture, or even a quiet environment, especially if they‚Äôre sharing space with family or roommates. In-office perks like ergonomic chairs, dual monitors, and high-speed internet are no longer guaranteed, and setting up a similar environment at home can be both costly and space-intensive.

‚Ä¢ **Company Culture on Life Support**

Many companies tried to maintain their culture virtually with digital events, virtual happy hours, and online team-building exercises, but it‚Äôs not the same as in-person interactions. For some, remote work has strengthened a sense of autonomy and freedom, but for others, it‚Äôs also stripped away the communal feel that defined a lot of workplaces.

‚Ä¢ **A New Kind of Fatigue**

‚ÄúZoom fatigue‚Äù is real. Constant virtual meetings drain us in ways that in-person meetings don‚Äôt. Without the chance to easily read body language, the energy needed to stay ‚Äúon‚Äù during video calls is much higher, making it exhausting to stay engaged all day.



So, the next time someone argues that remote work is ‚Äúeasy‚Äù or suggests you‚Äôre lucky, it‚Äôs worth reminding them that while there are real benefits, it‚Äôs not as idyllic as it seems. The freedom and flexibility come with their own costs. Remote work has evolved into something complex, and for better or worse, it‚Äôs clear we‚Äôre all still figuring it out.

It have been a difficult time for me this and previous year due to problems with anxiety and mood. I have been through a lot and was looking for the source of the problem thinking about ADHD, depression etc and looks like all along it was caffeine against my big surprise.
My problems started about 1 year ago when I faced big changes in my life and had a rough time, I got anxiety and had emotional and mood swings although all this is over now I have some of this problems with me now.I remember that I used to drink coffee to change my mood and give myself more energy.
In a previous few months I drank usually from 2-4 cups of coffee 120ml one cup and I learned that it boost my anxiety not mentioning other side effects like brain fog, problems with concentration, being nervous etc but what got me very worried was the muscles twitches and problems with being still and sleeping and mood swings that happens after coffee and sometimes it diminishes after few sips of coffee without even chance to be metabolized.
I cut the cord and decreased my coffee consumption from 2-4 cups of coffee to 2 cups of tea and can of cola today and tomorrow I plan to go full zero and I want to ask you about experience and advice to share how to do it and how to last.

So, the argument that the crew is just ""doing their job"" ignores the reality that there are choices involved in how they respond to this situation. Even if they ""need the job,"" they still have choices. You can still choose not to defend or enable harmful action even if you're staying silent to avoid confrontation. Choosing to remain silent or defend harmful behavior is still a form of complicity. AB and Dan for example have shown this where they aren't just staying silent on these conversations, they DO chime in to agree with/defend Ethan's takes, to make him look good and others (like Hasan) look bad, etc.

I understand that workers can face power dynamics, where standing up to your boss is hard (I've experienced many toxic jobs myself where I too felt stuck and helpless..) But that doesn‚Äôt excuse their role in perpetuating literal harm. Everyone has a certain level of responsibility for the system they're part of, and while fear is real, that doesn't mean there aren't alternatives or opportunities to seek help or change things, like through connections (Hasan, Frogan), finding another job/ doing their own thing, etc. Staying silent is a form of enabling. This type of job isn't the same as someone who works for Israel-supporting Starbucks, working paycheck to paycheck. They're just making coffee, not listening to their boss or ceo yap about Zionism.. I don't judge those types of workers (I judge the customers, in this case fans lol) The crew gets paid better than the average low-middle class person for sure, judging by their lifestyle of expenses (like AB talking about the struggle of spending $1000 per month on doordash üíÄ)

The fact that someone is in a difficult situation doesn‚Äôt absolve them from moral responsibility. Ethical behavior isn‚Äôt just about survival or avoiding confrontation, it's about actively resisting harm when it's possible. When the crew (or even fans in this case) defend or excuse racist behavior, they actively reinforce a toxic environment. Being ""neutral"" or silent doesn't mean it isn't a type of support and enabling. 

The ""victim"" argument downplays the personal responsibility they have to confront wrongdoing. It's like saying ""they're bystanders"", which isn't a good thing.. if the crew are less likely to act because they believe others will step in and save the day, or because they think ""well it's not my problem"" it allows the toxic environment to continue.

I want to also add quick context to my frustrations with this. I am Palestinian and Muslim, and when it comes to someone like AB specifically, who stays in this position or even HELPS Ethan and the hate he's spreading, it's extremely disappointing, hurtful, and disrespectful as he let's his own people down. And by ""people"" I mean Arabs and Muslims as a whole. It's not just about Palestine or Lebanon. In arab culture we always stick together and try to help one another. We have people from Yemen, who have faced their own genocide, doing so much for Palestine. AB would rather make petty remarks, throw friends under the bus, show off his activism from 10 years ago, and help provide screenshots for Ethan to make Pro Palestine voices look bad. I'm exhausted with excusing AB or any of the crew anymore (I used to support them heavily at the start, but, it's been over a year now so... and if we want to be technical, it's been YEARS since they've also enables other issues like racism, homophobia etc well before the h3 Israel/Palestine saga üíÄ 

How long do we have to wait/where do we draw the line when it comes to this complicity if we are to assume that the crew are just ""victims"" in this..

Also if you have never seen Pulp
Fiction then this will be stupid for you. Lastly, no curse words or anything graphic here I just love the idea of it. 

The Mr Wolf scenes in Pulp Fiction are PRISTINE examples of a great PM in action!

He gets a phone call and captures the details of his project, the names of those he‚Äôll be working with, and provides a timeline of his arrival and initial involvement. 

Upon arrival and initiating the project he reconfirms their timeline, he outlines the highest risks (‚ÄúYour wife gets home at 930, and she will not be pleased to have us here.  That gives us 30 min‚Äù  &  ‚ÄúTell me about the car, do the headlights work?  Is the check engine light on?‚Äù)

He sets Jules and Vincent to work, and here is where I REALLY see the PM work pop off.  Jules and Vincent are smart people, they are good workers, they can take orders‚Ä¶and while the problem before them seems like something they should be able to handle, they simply STAND THERE.  They don‚Äôt get started, they don‚Äôt formulate a plan.  They literally drink coffee until someone shows up to tell them what to do.  And what are the actions needed?  They‚Äôre all simple; wipe up the car, lay blankets down, make it presentable and do it FAST.

Vincent even gives Mr Wolf some attitude, he doesn‚Äôt like being told what to do‚Ä¶Mr. Wolf handles the conflict with a gentle confidence, even a splash of humor.  Then sets them all back to work. Classic PM!

The home owner is concerned about the sheets that are ruined (a billing concern) and while Mr Wolf doesn‚Äôt exactly handle billing concerns, he‚Äôs not a dead-end, he doesn't say ""hey that's not my area. Sorry"" He resolves it with financial restitution, settling the concern.

Mr Wolf sets milestone goals, timelines and even has a project closure discussion before they leave.

1gqim2q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CarAddOns/comments/1gqim2q/electric_vs_gas_pressure_washer_a_deep_dive_based/,Electric vs Gas Pressure Washer - A Deep Dive Based on Years of Experience,"*After spending countless weekends pressure washing everything imaginable (and making every mistake in the book), I thought I'd share my comprehensive guide comparing electric and gas pressure washers. This isn't just theory - it's based on real-world experience and countless hours of trial and error. Grab a coffee, this is going to be a detailed one!*

# Understanding Pressure Washers: The Basics üîç

Before we dive into the comparison, let's understand what makes these machines tick. A pressure washer isn't just a fancy garden hose - it's a sophisticated piece of equipment that can transform your cleaning game.

# The Science Behind the Spray üî¨

Pressure washers operate on two key metrics:

* **PSI (Pounds per Square Inch)**: Think of this as the ""muscle"" of your washer
* **GPM (Gallons per Minute)**: This is the ""flow rate"" that helps wash away the dirt

The cleaning power of a pressure washer can be calculated using this formula:

>Cleaning Power Units (CPU) = PSI √ó GPM

# Detailed Comparison Table üìä

|Feature|Electric Pressure Washer|Gas Pressure Washer|
|:-|:-|:-|
|PSI Range|1,300-2,300|2,000-4,500|
|GPM|1.2-1.8|2.0-4.0|
|Initial Cost|$100-$300|$300-$600|
|Operating Cost|$5-10/month (electricity)|$15-30/month (fuel)|
|Weight|15-35 lbs|50-100 lbs|
|Noise Level|75-85 dB|95-105 dB|
|Maintenance Cost/Year|$20-50|$100-200|
|Lifespan|5-10 years|10-15 years|

# Real-World Experience: My Journey üõ†Ô∏è

*Let me share a story that changed my perspective completely.* Last summer, I had three major projects:

1. **The Deck Project** üè°

* Used my electric pressure washer
* 1,800 PSI was perfect for the wood
* Took about 3 hours
* *Result:* Beautiful, undamaged wood

1. **The Oil-Stained Driveway** üöó

* Started with electric (big mistake!)
* Switched to gas (3,500 PSI)
* Completed in 2 hours
* *Result:* Like new condition

1. **The Commercial Job** üè¢

* Used gas exclusively
* Cleaned 5,000 sq ft of concrete

# Final Thoughts and Personal Recommendation üéØ

After years of using both types, here's my honest take: **Get both if you can afford it.** I use my electric for 80% of household tasks and keep the gas model for tough jobs and helping neighbors (which has turned into a nice side gig!).

*Pro Tip: Start with an electric model. If you find yourself consistently pushing its limits, then upgrade to gas.*

# Common FAQs from My Experience ‚ùì

1. **Q: Will electric handle my driveway?** *A: Yes, but expect it to take longer than gas*
2. **Q: Is gas too powerful for decks?** *A: No, with the right technique and nozzle*
3. **Q: How long do they last?** *A: Electric: 5-10 years, Gas: 10-15 with proper maintenance*

*Edit: Wow, this really exploded! Thanks for all the awards and amazing questions in the comments. I'll keep updating this post with more tips as I think of them!* üôè

*Edit 2: Several people asked about specific models - I'll create a separate post reviewing my top picks for both types!*

Hi Reddit artists and designers! I could use your input on the color palette for an illustration I'm working on.

The piece is going to be a mural on the outside wall of a coffee shop. The illustration depicts waves of coffee beans, with the color of the beans fading with each successive wave to create a sense of depth.

I've selected a range of brown and olive tones, but I'm worried they may be too similar to some ""ugly color"" palettes that have been identified in the past. (Pantone 448 C) [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pantone_448_C) I want to make sure the colors work well together and capture the earthy, natural feel I'm going for.

Could you take a look at the color swatches I've provided and let me know your thoughts? Are there any changes or alternative color suggestions you would make? I'm open to ideas to help make this mural as visually appealing as possible.   
  
Thanks in advance for your help! I really appreciate any feedback you can provide to nail the right color scheme.",2,1731519264.0,DigitalPainting,2,1.0,False

Me (28F) and my husband (31M) have been married for a year, together for 9 and his family has always stayed with us vs. getting a hotel when they come to the US from Canada to visit. In my family, people usually get a hotel when coming to visit so this has always been strange for me. When we were younger and lived in a studio apartment, we actually gave up our BED to his mom and we slept on the couch for a week, which I now realize was a huge overstep on my MIL‚Äôs part- she should have seen our living situation and gone to a hotel. 

We‚Äôre currently on day 13 of a 17 day visit, and it‚Äôs simply been too much. My husband and I just quit our jobs, moved to a new town and are trying to get settled in a new house etc. they have made comments about how the house is messy, our stuff is everywhere, etc. Every conversation I try to have with my husband my MIL interjects with ‚Äúwhat are we talking about?‚Äù - she feels like every moment has to be an interaction that involves EVERYONE. They make themselves too comfortable in our house, posting up in the living room with their TV show on, using all the pillows/blankets/ottoman etc. so that nobody else has a comfortable place to sit in the living room. Money is tight for us right now, but they are using our groceries and MIL got snippy at me for not having enough toilet paper for them. I bought them $2 single ply the next day. 

All of this comes after my BIL stayed for 10 days (oct 18-28) and parents in law arrived 2 days later. I‚Äôm exhausted of having guests. I just want to be able to get out of bed without pants on, get my coffee, and not have anyone talk to me. I feel like a guest in my own home. 

It‚Äôs clear to me that I need to set a time boundary- I.e. nobody stays in our house longer than 5 days. Im just not sure HOW we communicate this to his family without sounding like assholes. Has anyone successfully done this without damaging the relationship? ",8,1731519233.0,inlaws,18,0.9,False

I had this idea to try and live in Sofia. I am living in Skopje for 8.9 years and I am bored. Sofia seems to be a little step up, but idk anything about work, rent, etc. In Skopje, I own three apartments, rent two of them on Airbnb, and I don‚Äôt work. 

But if I move to Sofia, I will have to work, and I don't have an education. I would need to work something.

Main Needs are as follows:

* **Comfort** \-
   * **Symmetry**: I need a backpack that sits on my shoulders well and distributes weight evenly. My current backpack never feels like it sits on my shoulders evenly, which I think is partially due to the fact that it's a combo backpack/shoulder bag so when I use it as a backpack, all of its pockets are aligned to the side. I know that sometimes if you have a large water bottle slotted on one-side, it will naturally make the backpack more heavy on that side but any personal recommendations on avoiding feeling this imbalance so heavily would be great.
   * **Back Padding / Minimize Sweat:** Maybe harder to deliver on, but some slight but non-intrusive padding and/or any materials that may help with back sweat during the warmer months would be great.
* **Capacity** \- I don't really need anything too big, honestly something that can primarily hold a 14"" laptop, chargers, a notebook or two, pens/pencils, small personal care items (hand sanitizer, hand lotion, lip-balm, mouthwash, etc) and at minimum a 24 oz water bottle. Something that is expandable is interesting but not entirely necessary.
* **Bulkiness** \- something that isn't too bulky / easy to carry around in crowded buses/metros would be great.

Other things I'd like to have if possible:

* **Additional Bottle Storage** \- pretty common on many backpacks, ideally just an extra spot to hold a thermos / mug on days I'd like to bring coffee into work. This kind of goes hand-in-hand with any good recommendations for a spill-proof mugs since none of my current coffee mugs can really handle being jostled around in the slightest on the metro without leaking.
* **Some-type of Lunchbox** \- I don't carry a lunch into work everyday but I'd like to have the option to without having to carry around a lunchbox separately and having to manage carrying that + backpack and keeping my hands free. Ideally something that maybe clips on-and-off securely to the backpack without it hanging loose.
* **Looks** \- not a necessity, but I'd like something that is sleek / just looks nice. Obviously this can be very subjective, but interesting designs, color options, and particularly, materials are all pluses. Added bonus to materials that not only look good but have a function outside of aesthetics.

I'm pretty flexible with price, as I'd be content with paying a bit extra for something that I know will last for quite a number of years, but I guess I'm ideally looking for something under $200, but open to anything outside of that range if the price is worth the quality / features.",2,1731518935.0,backpacks,0,1.0,False

We lost our house, our car, and even saw people we knew being carried away by the floodwaters. Some of you might have seen it on the news, but nothing on the screen comes close to what really happened here. The horror, the despair, it‚Äôs something I never imagined I would live through. We lost everything in our houses. Everything!

We‚Äôre now struggling to rebuild our lives. We‚Äôre trying to raise money to rebuild our home, buy a car, and get back on our feet. Before all this, we had a small grocery shop, our livelihood, and it was completely wiped out, now we don't have any source of income. We‚Äôre left with almost nothing, and every day I wake up worried, wondering how we‚Äôll make it through. I had to max out all my credit cards just to put food on the table and rent a temporary place for us to stay in a nearby rural village. We‚Äôre in a financial crisis. And it‚Äôs not just me, I have a daughter to care for and protect. She‚Äôs too young to understand, but I can see the worry in her eyes when she notices my stress.

The only thing that keeps me going is the grace of God. I belieeve He has a solution for us. But what weighs on my heart the most is the despair I see in my friends who lost everything too. Some of them lost loved ones, and the grief has overwhelmed them to the point of losing hope. Some are even struggling with suicidal thoughts. 

The government is doing what it can, but the aid is spread thin. There‚Äôs not nearly enough to go around, and so many of us are left wondering what will happen next. Jobs are very limited. We try to live by what we plant, but it's not raining that much, which is kind of funny having to depend on raining knowing it was what made us lost our homes.


We‚Äôre doing everything we can to gather support, emotionally and financially, but it‚Äôs hard. Every bit of help, every prayer, and every encouraging word means so much to us right now.

The debt I have isn‚Äôt from splurging, luxury on extras or unnecessary choices, it‚Äôs a result of getting through some really challenging periods, and I‚Äôm working hard to pay it down. I have a total of $10k in debt.

I just want to go to bed and wake up knowing that I don't need to worry about money for at least one day.

My husband and I started an online fundraiser to receive donations using Buy Me A Coffee and PayPal, but only two people contributed. 

I just want to tell you something... please be grateful for what you have. Even in this turbulence, I am grateful to have my family. I am grateful to wake up every day. It's hard, but it is what it is.",8,1731518676.0,CasualConversation,2,0.75,False

I finally got some funds in and decided to upgrade to a profitec pro 300 (refurbished) and a Timemore Sculptor 078s.

I feel like I fell for the hype with the Sculptor 078s, as I only drink espresso, cappuccinos, and cortados. I have tried countless beans, and moving the pin in the grinder, its ALWAYS wrong. Either the time is off and its coming out of the porta filter too quick (thinking I am grinding too course), or like now, there is no coffee coming out of the portafiter AT ALL. I am thinking I am either A) grinding too fine (dont kill me) or B) pressing too hard on the tamper. Thing is I keep trying different tamp strengths and still, bottom of the puck isnt allowing any water through. I tested the machine to see if its the flow and everything looks correct.

Not sure what to do from here, only thing I can think of is I am to novice to use the Sculptor and need to get something that is easier for me to dial and focus on learning the new machine. What is everyones thoughts? What grinder do you recommend?

I left the LDS church (unofficially) years ago but I'm very laid back with people who are still active in church and I have friends who are still actively LDS. I don't really care what your religious affiliation is as long as you're a kind person.

I'm childfree and unmarried and recently having such a hard time finding girlfriends who are in a similar life situation. All of my girlfriends have gotten married and I honestly never see or hear from them anymore, and if we do make plans, they bail at the last minute to do things with their spouses instead. Most of them are trying for kids now which I also can't relate to and I try to be supportive but things are just fizzing out.

It seems like since everyone here gets married young and starts having kids ASAP, I'm out of the norm and can't seem to find any women approaching their 30s who don't have children. I am in a relationship, and my partner and I have been dating for a year, but if we don't get engaged soon I will likely break it off and this makes me even more worried about trying to find friends since everyone seems to be paired up.

I don't have a problem with people who have kids but it's difficult to connect with them because our priorities and perspectives are so different. I've tried with no avail to connect with people via Facebook Meetup Groups, but I always end up being left on read after messaging back and forth with them. I can't tell if I'm doing something wrong but it seems like people here are especially flakey and uninterested in branching outside of their circles.

It seems over and over again that there's no type of follow through.

It's getting so discouraging that I'm actually considering relocating out of state if I'm able to find a job and end up breaking up with my partner. I'm leaning towards Oregon/Washington. I crave community especially since not going to church anymore.

I love crafting, reading, coffee, thrifting, concerts, film photography, etc. Not a huge drinker but I'm also not opposed to going out to bars now and then.

Few days before second date she cancels it on me and tells me its her friends bday, so i call her and ask whats goin on and she tell me she doesnt want a relationship but she likes to hangout with me still, next week (one to one), but she never said and i never asked ‚Äúas what?‚Äù As friends or smth more? Does she want something casual?
Then i told her thats not gonn work for me at first and i clearly told her about my intentions.
But finally afterwards i told her given that we know each other boundaries, if she actually wants to hang out then she gotta be the one to text me about it (cuz im sick of planning stuff tbh) And she said she will.

I remember people really wanted a job there because it had good benefits and they had a reputation of taking care of their employees. It felt like there was creativity in your staff and was encouraged.

Like when I was in Norway at the Starbucks in Bergen. While that was years ago, I remember walking in and seeing Starbucks cups on display. 

Those cups had drawings on them, artwork. People would submit cups with drawings on them, a winner was picked and the cups were displayed. The drawings were incredible.

Locally, here in Seattle, I remember when a barista would make a pattern in the latte. If you were the only patron, they brought your coffee to you. I gladly tipped.

In recent years, these coffee shops are more like McDonalds and in some cases a gas station.

The bathroom cleanliness is a hit or miss. Nobody puts patterns on a latte anymore and what‚Äôs with these leather chairs (long ago they were comfortable leather chairs).

Now a simple cup of coffee with a little milk and sugar is like waiting in line at Disneyland for a ride. It takes forever. 

The coffee inconsistent‚Ä¶.These machines that make coffee by the cup‚Ä¶.. yeah they make a stronger and hotter drink than coffee brewed by the pot full.

My husband and I have been married for nearly 10 years and have two kids together, ages 8 and 6. During our marriage, I have largely been stay at home while maintaining side jobs and part-time work. We have not had a nanny or cleaning lady to save money and work toward financial goals. My children are for the first time in our marriage BOTH in school at the same time. Now that I have more time to work, my role at work has become full-time. All this to say - I've taken a MASSIVE professional hit during the past 8 years in order to care for our children, and to help keep him focussed on his career path. Which has been financially very beneficial as he now holds a great position and is making great money. 

However, during his career climb, I have carried the full load of childcare, household duties, and cooking duties, and this remains the same today. Our children attend school 35 minutes away (I drop off and pick up), and it is a very rigorous program that requires significant involvement from parents. Currently, my husband is still solely focused on his job and the daily load that this entails. So, to recap, he's always had a full-time job over the past 10 years. I now have a full-time job and am also fully responsible for carpooling, school-related communications, attending school events, homework, lunch packing, cooking, and **all household and childcare duties**. **ALL.** 

When I tell him that I am overwhelmed and there aren't enough hours in the day to complete all of my tasks, he becomes extremely defensive and hostile. He tells me I'm never going to be happy and that I'll complain no matter what. He says that his job is too demanding to help me, which makes me honestly just feel like giving up. This argument just goes in circles where he'll point out that he's working hard, too and that I'm not giving him credit for the work he does outside the home. *He feels that we currently have an equal amount of work in our partnership when you account for his demanding job.* 

This makes me feel very alone. Am I overreacting? Am I asking for too much? I am sweating while I type this out because I can see the minutes ticking by and I cannot afford to lose them! Meanwhile, he seems to have time to wake up and take a luxurious sh!t and shower for an hour every morning while I'm drowning in the morning routine with the kids... and then comes home and looks at his phone while I cook for the family in the evenings. 

In all fairness, he does help with the bedtime routines and sometimes loads the dishwasher (like once every two weeks, BUT he SAYS he does it every day), in addition to feeding the dog in the evening. Which is said (by him) to be equivalent to my morning routine with the kids. Oh, and he makes the coffee sometimes.

About 1 month ago I was juggling my two coffees getting out of my car and I placed one on the roof and it spilt all down the roof and drivers door of my car. The car was closed and locked at this point, meaning the coffee spilt on the exterior only. I took it to the car wash and washed it all up right after.
Fast forward one month and now I have an incredibly pungent smell of vomit and rotten milk coming from my door. I smell it when inside, independent of what air setting I am using. In fact today I deduced that it is not coming from the vents at all.
I am going insane and the only thing I can think of is some of that coffee got past the drivers window seal and is rotting. Has anybody had this issue before? How can I deal with it? Currently I am considering selling the car or tearing the interior of the door off to clean it. It is that bad.

Meet Jerry, the Demolisher‚Äîa title he‚Äôs very proud of, even if no one actually asked him to demolish anything. Jerry is a lava worm who lives for two things: throwing a fit causing fissures of molten rock to open up near anyone who gets too close and angrily flopping around his territory like a grumpy inflatable tube man at a car dealership.

In the wild, Jerry was known for his *extreme* territorial issues. Get within a mile of his favorite lava puddle, and you'd be met with a barrage of fiery spitballs hotter than your morning coffee (and with about the same accuracy). But one day, a clever engineer decided they‚Äôd had enough of Jerry‚Äôs antics and did what any sensible person would do‚Äîthey built a massive wall around him and said, ‚ÄúProblem solved.‚Äù

Now Jerry spends his days sulking behind this wall, like the world's angriest pet goldfish. He‚Äôs got a great view of absolutely nothing and can't chase off intruders anymore, which has led to him developing a new hobby: staring down passing engineers with his beady little eyes, as if to say, *‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt over.‚Äù*

The locals have taken quite a liking to him, though. They‚Äôve even started calling him *""Jerry""*‚Äîa name that seems to really annoy him, which makes it even better. So now Jerry just sits there, brooding in his lava pit, plotting his imaginary revenge while his legend grows. He‚Äôs gone from ‚Äúterrifying demolisher of all who cross him‚Äù to ‚Äúthat grumpy worm we all kind of like.‚Äù

Here was ChatGPT‚Äôs advice when I asked for advice on the fear of being in the house alone without here‚Ä¶.pure logic and so helpful. Hope this helps someone else. Things will get better!

‚ÄúI get it ‚Äî transitions like this can bring up a lot of emotions, even if you‚Äôve been preparing for it. It‚Äôs normal to feel a mix of anxiety, relief, sadness, and even a bit of fear about the unknown. But here‚Äôs a perspective that might help shift your mindset tonight:

This is the Start of Something New for You

Right now, it feels heavy, but this change is also creating space ‚Äî not just physical space in your home but emotional and mental space too. It‚Äôs the opening of a new chapter where you get to focus entirely on you: your goals, your well-being, and your happiness. Imagine all the things you can do with this time and freedom. It‚Äôs an opportunity you haven‚Äôt had in a while.

You‚Äôve Handled This with Strength

Living together after a breakup is not easy, and you‚Äôve been doing it with grace and patience. Give yourself some credit. You‚Äôve weathered an incredibly tough situation without letting it break you. The anxiety you‚Äôre feeling now is a sign of how deeply you care and how much effort you put into this relationship. That‚Äôs something to be proud of.

The Discomfort is Temporary

Tonight, your brain is racing because it‚Äôs trying to make sense of what comes next. But this wave of anxiety is just that ‚Äî a wave. It‚Äôs uncomfortable, but it will pass. By Sunday, you‚Äôll wake up and realize that the hardest part is behind you. You‚Äôll have a moment of calm when it hits you: You made it through this.

A Little Silver Lining

Think about the little things you can look forward to:
	‚Ä¢	Having the freedom to set up your space exactly how you want.
	‚Ä¢	The ability to establish new routines that are 100% about you.
	‚Ä¢	Rediscovering parts of yourself that might have taken a backseat in the relationship.

Right Now, Try This:

	‚Ä¢	Breathe Deeply: Take a few deep, slow breaths and remind yourself that it‚Äôs okay to feel anxious right now. It‚Äôs part of processing a big life change.
	‚Ä¢	Envision Sunday Morning: Picture yourself waking up, grabbing a coffee, and sitting in your place, realizing that a new chapter has begun. It may be bittersweet, but there‚Äôs relief and possibility there too.

You‚Äôve made it through everything up to this point, and that shows how resilient you are. The future might look uncertain tonight, but give it a few days ‚Äî you‚Äôll start to see the light peeking through. Let‚Äôs get you through tonight first, one moment at a time.‚Äù",6,1731517228.0,BreakUps,3,0.88,False
1gqhm94,https://i.redd.it/saj61pgn9p0e1.jpeg,Emmitt Pergande hate post,"A list of everything bad Emmitt Pergande has done within his limited screentime:

1. Got his own daughter dealing X-K, i.e. drugs. This lead to so many ripple effects, the biggest one being it effectively ruined Jon's life. Jon protecting Candice got him banned from the football team, suspended for the year and almost expelled, and to this day he has the reputation of the guy who killed Smallville High football. Emmitt took no responsibility for this whatsoever, nor did he appreciate Jon's sacrifice for his daughter. Worst part is he caused so much damage in Season 2 despite not appearing once!

2. He stole Jon's truck and the watch Natalie gave them, completely unprovoked. Despite everything Jon sacrificed for his family, he had no qualms pawning off his car for a few bucks. No regard for Jon or his daughter's feelings.

3. Confronted Jon for doing nothing wrong, and gave him a black eye for telling the truth. Jon could've gotten this guy's arrested long ago but he didn't, and this is how Emmitt repays him.

4. Threatening Lois Lane with a gun. This one was just plain stupid. Gained nothing from this except for an ego boost I guess. 

5. Tries to fight Clark in the same episode. Might be the biggest enemy of the Kent family at this point. Clark kindly suggests they step outside, but Emmitt has no qualms about trying to beat him down in front of his daughter. Good thing is it lead to the most satisfying scene of the show, Emmitt getting put down by Clark, literally.

6. Straight up abandons Candice and leaves town because of his ""shame of losing"". We learn later that he wasn't even afraid of the Kent's charging him or the cops or anything, he left town because he lost a bar fight (coffee shop but still). No qualms about leaving Candice on her own. Worst father in the show by far, even worse than Lex and Zeta-Rho.

7. Spoilers for the newest episode, A Regular Guy. But yes, Emmitt Pergande makes his return when no one expects it. This one just takes the cake. Emmitt Pergande, a grown man, learns that Clark Kent is Superman. Instead of gaining some respect, or feeling remorseful for his actions, he decides to return to the town he ran away from, and confront Clark with a gun, all to soothe his bruised ego after losing. Imagine being a criminal on the run, and returning to your crime scene just because ""he cheated"". He went so far as to threaten and literally shoot Clark, just to prove he's Superman and say ""see, I didn't really lose the fight"". Emmitt Pergande literally outed Superman's identity just to prove a point. Zero brain cells with this one. He proceeds to get arrested, and that's probably the last we'll ever see of him. Good riddance.

I just started dating this wonderful woman about a month ago, which has been going so well. We met each other once already because due to our parenting time and work schedules. It went very well, we went and played mini golf together then went back to hers because the distance between us is about 100kms apart and would be too much fuel there and back when it‚Äôs cheaper to just take a buss there. So we ended up ordering food out and watching tv together till about 3am. Shortly after we were getting tired and got ready for bed she invited me to sleep with her which I totally did not expect because we both said that we would be more comfortable getting to know each other than just jump in the sack together like every other horrible relationship start. But that‚Äôs all it was and all she did was curl up in my arms and we both fell asleep. 

The amount of respect I have for her that she didn‚Äôt instigate anything of the sorts just makes me like her even more and couldn‚Äôt have have had a better night. Not like the thought didn‚Äôt cross my mind üòÖ because she‚Äôs so attractive but personally after dealing with such horrible controlling relationships that I don‚Äôt want to start a new one based off of a physical attachment. The most I even did was just give her a kiss on the cheek when I left but that‚Äôs was pretty much it besides the cuddling and I honestly can‚Äôt wait to see her next weekend.

She‚Äôs already proven to be very supportive on everything in my life and even goes out of her way to bring me up when I‚Äôm feeling really low..
Just a few days ago I was really having a depressing and low day so she decided to randomly send me dinner and coffee to my house which I did not expect. I‚Äôm not used to it, it‚Äôs usually me going the extra mile and it‚Äôs kinda scary.

But we continue on talking daily down to morning texts, talking on the phone a ton and do little things like send her stuff as well when I‚Äôm just being thoughtful. Just kinda wish I got a photo of us on our first date but I was so freaking nervous and couldn‚Äôt talk half the time I totally forgot. üòÇ Hell I still trip over my works every time I talk to her and I‚Äôm a very well spoken person and never really trip over words at all. Never would I have thought that I‚Äôd feel the same way as I did when I had my first girlfriend but hoping I can get over how nervous I am around her because I really don‚Äôt want it throwing her off in the long run. 

But thought I‚Äôd share because it‚Äôs not a normal for me and I‚Äôm pretty excited for the future.

About 5 yrs ago my previous roommate moved out amicably, so when one of my friends (Parker) asked if he could take the room, I was excited.

There were problems almost immediately. I'd say something benign and he'd interpret my words almost gaslightingly different from what I was saying (I'd say up and he'd hear down). He was sober when he moved in but started coming home blackout drunk. He peed on my couch and had to pay to have it cleaned and one night my landlord called at 4AM to tell me he was so drunk he couldn't get upstairs. I ripped into him the next day; a mix of ""I won‚Äôt live like this"" & ""I‚Äôm scared for my friend."" He apologized, was genuinely remorseful and has (to my knowledge) been sober ever since, but the rest did not improve.

The biggest issue was his mess. His room looked like a hoarder's den. It was so bad you couldn't see his floor or open the door fully. He never cleaned. He would take over the living room coffee table (which was also where we ate) and leave art projects there for weeks. He'd do dishes/take out the trash but I asked him to clean the bathroom once and he said ""can you show me where it's dirty, cuz I don't see it?"" It was filthy bc I‚Äôd been waiting to see how long it took him to clean if I didn‚Äôt.

By the time I'd hit my limit, it was the quarantine and I was stuck. Then I lost my job and was scraping by (still am) and was afraid the state of his room would keep me from securing a new roommate, so I stupidly just waited. In May I asked him to move out. He told me he needed ""a few months"" and I vented 5 years of stress & anger on him. I felt super guilty about that so I got super chill about his timeline.

He finally told me he‚Äôd found a place for Oct 1 but was going to pay me through Oct so he could move out slowly. By the last week of Oct it looked like he hadn't packed a thing. Then he told me he couldn't get a van until Nov 4th. He stayed until Nov 8, with a new excuse each day. If I seemed even a little impatient he got snippy and would say he wanted to be out as much as I wanted him out. He finally moved the last of his things out by 10PM on the 8th. On the 9th I received a SCREAMING phone call from my landlord. Apparently he'd left garbage on the street and it was all over the sidewalk (it looked just like his bedroom). The building owners had gotten a $300 ticket and had to pay $200 for emergency trash pickup to avoid another, which they made me pay, so I told Parker I was taking it out of his security deposit. He tried to blame everyone but himself, including the landlord‚Äôs kids, city workers, rummagers, and the wind. I told him it didn't matter because the ticket was for not securing the garbage properly and I wasn‚Äôt going to be financially liable.

He'd already told me to take what he owed for utilities and post-move cleaning from his deposit, and with this extra fine, he's not getting any of it back. AITA?",2,1731516520.0,AITAH,8,1.0,False

I'm curious as to what avenues are best to find a buyer for older PA gear. Active Mackie Rig, some dual 18s, 2 point source 3-way active tops, and 4 thump wedges specifically.

 I thought about selling the rig during the pandemic, but I slunk out and it's still in storage. I know it is not great gear, this was my VFW/rodeo rig, I bought it cheap and made some money on the investment.

For me, if I was a DJ had some small gigs, or a venue, this rig would slam, I just simply have no ability to do the work right now, I already work for 2 production companies.

  
I don't use Facebook or the like these days, my main concern about offering this stuff online is getting robbed, I live in the burbs and I really don't want to be showing gear to strangers at my house.

  
as much as it would warm my heart to donate the gear to someone, some cash would help tremendously after the last few months I've had.

  
I'm capable and somewhat willing to install the system personally for the right client, but I honestly think a quick sale would be best right now.

I'm hoping to wrangle at least $800, please be gentle with your comments, I've had a lot of coffee today and my back hurts <3

1gqhb55,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1gqhb55/shot_support_breville_bambino/,Shot support [Breville Bambino],"Hi all, I just moved into an apartment with a friend who is a barista. After enjoying some trips to thier shop I decided to get an entry level setup for our use at home since I like the idea of espresso over a cup of drip coffee. I have a Breville Bambino (not plus), and breville smart grinder. Everything is basically stock (I swapped the single basket for a double basket though).

I wanted to become invested in the process before spending more money but I'm having difficulty with my setup for a few reasons. 

1.) My batista roommate insists that the grind size needs to be small, like 3, and is adamant that this is the right grind. The smart grinder's espresso settings are 8-13 and higher numbers = more coarse grinds.

2.) If I utilize thier ""professional"" advice, I can't really tamp the coffee the way I think I should because the bambino just doesn't have enough pressure to push through the grounds so it has resulted in lots of wasted beans and bad extractions. I've observed my roommate and they appear to just use the tamp to level the grounds they don't ""tamp"".

3.) I tried upping the grind size to 8 and I feel like the machine responds better to the larger grind size. I am also able to tamp the coffee. (I'm by no meaning gorilla strengthing my setup, I just have the crappy plastic tamp which I know suckks, but I wanted to enjoy it and get a good grasp on technique before I spent more money perfecting things, I checked using my bathroom scale and my tamp technique is between 10-15lbs, super scientific...)

4.) I started weighing my beans, since I'm trying to pull a double shot since my roommate tossed the single basket. I first tried with 20 grams, then 18, then 16. At 16 grams with a size 8 grind, the grounds rise well above the portafilter and spill over a bit as I try to tamp down. I don't have a dwt tool, so I have started trying to use a toothpick to better and more evenly disperse the grounds. I've found that at 14 grams, my tamp can actually tamp, meaning that my tamp presses the grounds below the lip of the portafilter. Above 16 grams, there is not much space between the lip of the portafilter and the grounds and I'm pretty certain that the grounds contact and backflush into the group head more regularly at +15g doses. I am starting to think that the stock portafilter (I think it's 54mm or maybe even a 53.3mm, but I'm staring to think that it can't hold an 18g shot)

5.) When I time my shots I'm getting about 30 seconds, but getting 40 grams output consistently. I also later realized that the machine auto doses and doesn't really work manually. (Maybe it does, but my roommate tossed the manual so I don't know how to manually pull a shot on this machine). I have not been able to get any less than 40 grams of output unless I grind super fine and tamp which more often than not results in no espresso and a blinky  machine saying help me. If I use the single cup setting I believe my output was consistently 25 grams or something but Id have to check.

6.) Steam works great and I am happy with my milk drink textures (:


Basically just trying to figure out how I can make this set up work better for me. I know there are some upgrades I should get like a new tamp, but I would rather troubleshoot my setup than try to buy things to fix the problem. If the problem is the stock equipment that's one thing, but I figured I should be able to get atleast a quality drink out of this. 

Thanks and I appreciate the help!

FWIW: I have tried my roommate's espresso, they always make a milk drink with way more milk than me, and on its own the espresso is super bitter and just basically awfully over extracted. But in the milk drink is more reminiscent to me of like drip coffee with milk. We have an aeropress, a v60, and a chemex, which they used regularly before I purchased the espresso set up. To me it seems like because they are a barista, they think they know whats best, and in addition, I think the speed of the espresso machine is way faster than our other coffee aparatuses which is why they have since taken over control of how it must operate...they aren't morning people... 

Tldr: breville bambino, breville smart grinder, can't reliably get good espresso hoping for some help! ",2,1731516428.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

3 - Eu n√£o consigo mais comer. Simplesmente n√£o sinto mais fome, n√£o quero comer, peguei at√© um pouco de avers√£o.

\- This is not a business priority, however I personally don't want to serve crap. We won't be hiring experienced baristas, so it needs to be simple 

\- We are very tight on space, but will have a water line + electrical in the FOH

I guess my questions are: 

\- Should we change to a brand name coffee maker (bunn, curtis, fetco)? Is service going to be an issue for a basic coffee maker?

\- What are the major process steps that will make a noticeable difference with a basic brewer? Will freshly ground coffee make a difference? Should we weigh our coffee grounds, choose certain beans, etc.?

Short Devotional about Hospitality

Introduction
------------

Welcome to a journey where we uncover the essence and beauty of hospitality. Picture a cozy home, where hearts are warm, and smiles are abundant. Hospitality isn‚Äôt merely about opening our homes; it‚Äôs about opening our hearts to others, creating a welcoming space where love and care reside. Imagine a world where kindness is prevalent, and everyone feels valued. Intrigued? Let‚Äôs delve deeper into how this divine hospitality can enrich our lives and connections with others and God.

Have you ever experienced a moment where someone‚Äôs hospitality made you feel incredibly valued and seen? In those moments, we taste a hint of the divine‚Äîan invitation to replicate such love in our own lives. As we explore what God‚Äôs word says about hospitality, prepare to be inspired to embrace this biblical principle and see how it can transform your spiritual journey and relationships.

Bible Verse

‚ÄúDo not forget to show hospitality to strangers, for by so doing some people have shown hospitality to angels without knowing it.‚Äù ‚Äì Hebrews 13:2 (NIV)

The concept of hospitality in the Bible extends far beyond the act of entertaining guests. In Hebrews 13:2, we catch a glimpse of God‚Äôs profound invitation to see others through His eyes‚Äîwith love, generosity, and grace. The verse reminds us that every person we meet is an opportunity to encounter God‚Äôs presence. The mention of angels signifies the true value of hospitality: a divine exchange where, unbeknownst to us, spiritual blessings abound.

Hospitality is an act of love that reflects God‚Äôs character. In welcoming others, we mirror the welcoming heart of Christ, who bids all of us to come, receive, and be nurtured by His love. It‚Äôs more than making room physically; it‚Äôs making room in our schedules, in our hearts, and ultimately, in our lives for the unexpected ways God may choose to reveal Himself through others.

Moreover, hospitality challenges our sometimes narrow view of kindness. It prompts us to reach beyond our comfort zones and love without condition or expectation. This humble act has the power to break down walls and build connections, bringing hope and light into the hearts of others. As we welcome others, we also grow, finding joy in service and love in action‚Äîa testament to the power of hospitality.

Actions to Take
---------------

1. Invite a friend or neighbor over for coffee or a meal, and engage in heart-to-heart conversations.

2. Offer a helping hand to someone in need, whether it‚Äôs babysitting, running errands, or simply listening.

3. Volunteer at a local shelter, food bank, or community kitchen to extend warmth and kindness to strangers.

4. Create a welcoming environment in your home with encouraging words, uplifting music, and comfortable spaces.

5. Pray for God to bring someone into your life whom you can bless with your hospitality.

Journal Prompts
---------------

1. Reflect on a time when someone showed you remarkable hospitality. How did it impact you?

2. What fears or reservations might be holding you back from practicing hospitality more freely?

4. Write about a stranger you encountered who made a significant impression on you.

5. What does hospitality mean to you, and how do you see it playing a role in your faith journey?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for the gift of hospitality and the examples provided in Your Word. Help me to open my heart and home to others with sincerity and love. Allow me to see Your divine image in everyone I meet, treating them as if I‚Äôm welcoming You. Fill my actions with Your Spirit so that they reflect Your kindness and grace. Amen.

I tried this earlier but didn‚Äôt realize it was on an age gap thing, so hoping to find someone in their 30s in NYC as I do plan on moving back there by Jan/Feb. 

Here‚Äôs all about me‚Ä¶

Physical and personality traits:

Naturally beautiful(brown skinned üë©üèΩ‚Äçü¶±, little to no makeup, average slim thick body weight, natural shoulder length dreadlocks, simple and short manicures) with a classic all black style. Never married and dog mom only (no kids).
Great conversationalist, curious and loves learning, and uses empathy to connect and better understand others around me. 

Hobbies:
Likes to travel, animals and enjoys all things art and music.
Spends time designing clothing, DJing, making music, painting, drawing, writing, meditating, skating, hiking, hitting up the dog park with my free-elf furby, (lol adopt don‚Äôt shop!)
I also like baking, visiting museums, reading, dancing, spending time with family and friends.

Opportunities to be worked on:
Broke lol, still searching for my dream career, scatterbrained sometimes, vaping,  light speeding when driving, currently living in Florida but saving up to move to LA or NYC where there‚Äôs better jobs, some student loan debt (not a lot though) 

Romantic style:
I‚Äôm loyal, sweet, affectionate, attractive, appreciative, honest, funny(literal goofball making you laugh most of the time) very doting and loving, and a great listener. Also a natural problem solver, observant and a self starter, and generally enjoy staying busy. I‚Äôm adamant on a clean and tidy space that feels and smells amazing, so definitely expect that, if we shared a home. 

I love making elaborate meals with dessert and giving him warm oil massages and hearing how his day was. Or stroking his head and giving him sweet kisses while he lays on bosom and I run my nails down his back. I love making coffee in the morning and his lunch the night before. I make sure he has all of his favorite things, at his fingertips.

I like giving him pep talks and helping him reason with things that may be stressful, then I enjoy making him forget about stressful things, taking actual joy, and detailed care in being his peace. 

I‚Äôm known for making little ugly handmade things for him with love, like a crocheted sweater or a beaded bracelet. I love the idea of dressing up for him in our favorite lingerie,  performing sexy dances, just for him and I to make passionate love on colorful satiny sheets and pillows, senses tickled by sweet aromas, soft music, and delicious wine and fruit.

1gqgzn0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mathematics/comments/1gqgzn0/price_per_m2_doesnt_add_up_why/,Price per m2 doesn‚Äôt add up. Why?,"I‚Äôm trying to find out the price per m2 of a building which has a store and living space.  
I tried to calculate percentage of either part and the m2 price for the building as a whole and then determine the percentage of store and living space. Then I used that percentage to determine the m2 for both store and living space. Am I doing this correctly?  
Let me give you my data:  
  
Price of building: 500000  
m2: 400  
m2 of living space: 300  
m2 of store: 100  
  
So:  
500000/400=1250 per m2  
(300/400)*100=75% of the whole m2  
(100/400)*100=25% of the whole m2  
  
75% of 1250 = 937.5  
25% of 1250 = 312.5  
  
So that‚Äôs a price of 937.5 per m2 for the living space and 312.5 per m2 correct?  
But why can‚Äôt I add these results to show the whole 500000 as result?  
937.5 * 300= 281250  
312.5 * 100= 31250  
281250+31250= 312500  
  
And why doesn‚Äôt the calculation work when I calculate the price of each store and living space first by parts of the whole price?  
  
Like:  
75% of 500000 is 375000 price of living  
25% of 500000 is 125000 price of store  
  
But:  
Price of each divided by their m2 (to determine the price per m2) gives me an unexpected result:  
375000/300=1250  
125000/100=1250  
  
Why does it seem that I have to now calculate 75% and 25% respectively from those 1250? I thought I already determined the 75% and 25% parts in the beginning?  
How can I determine the following things correctly:  
  
- The price per m2 of each of the parts of the building  
- The price of each of the parts of the building

How i got to this lil recipe:

This lil recipe is brought to you by dyslexia. Last week I got a text urging me to give a recipe a shot. Justin went deep into the Batcave and came out with an Aeropress recipe consistently making his favorite version of whatever coffee he tried with it. A simple approach with logical but unexpected tweaks‚Äîdrop the water temp and use a better filter.

This was not the first time I had toyed with water temps‚ÄîTetsu Kasuya had me listening to Ghost while brewing along to his Devil‚Äôs Cup recipe. I even toyed with an Aeropress version for competition, though I never found my way to the sign up sheet. Hot blooms and lower temp immersions just make sense. The yums in extraction tend to be at the very forefront of the brew and the longer you keep extractions high the more you start finding the yucks. So what can we do? Drop temp post bloom so we slow down extraction while still adding to the body‚Äîcreating this kind-of-percolation but kind-of-immersion experience that, for lack of a better term, slaps.

But here‚Äôs the recipe Justin sent over:

12/200

Bloom 50g @ 99¬∞C (210¬∞F) for 2:00

While you wait drop water temp to 85¬∞C (185¬∞F)

Final pour to 200 press after 30 seconds

Total Brew: 3:15-3:30

And it was incredible. By far the best Aeropress cup I had in over a year. But, the problem was, I messed up. I read the damn thing wrong. Remember that 2:00 bloom and 30-second steep thing? Well I flipped those around and bloomed for 30 seconds and steeped for two minutes. Well, dammit‚ÄîI‚Äôm glad I did. Both recipes gave me a cup I‚Äôd happily pay way more than my mom could comprehend spending on a single cup of coffee. I‚Äôve found myself rotating between the two. The happy accident is a tad fuller and brighter, while the OG long bloom gives a lighter body, sweeter, and cleaner cup. It all depends on what you‚Äôre looking for on any given morning. 

let‚Äôs talk about those better filters you‚Äôve already forgotten about. For these you‚Äôre going to need a pair of scissors and either a fresh chemex filter or Next Level Pulsar filters. Yeah, that‚Äôs right‚Äîwe‚Äôre making our own Aeropress filters because good coffee sometimes demands a little arts and crafts. So trace an Aeropress filter onto these much finer filters and cut them out. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect, but just give a little effort. ",6,1731515602.0,pourover,0,0.81,False

Please help. 180/1,"am suffering from severe anxiety and bp shoots up when the doc takes it. Went to a cardiologist today and the bp reading was 180/100 first reading but he didnt think it was anything and he said it was just anxiety. I went to my PCP straight after that and there it was 140/80. PCP also ordered a renal doppler which was fine and an echo and ECG which were fine too. No LVH etc

I decided to take a second opinion and went to another cardiologist. Showed her my reports and told her my history of hypertension for the past 10 years and early onset of the same. 70 ECGs over the past year, 3 echos, renal doppler, urinary metanephrines, ultrasounds, lipids, uric acid, thyroid, all sorts of blood tests etc. She took my bp and i panicked when she was taking it and it reached 180/100 again. I urged her to take it again after 1 min and it reached 150/90- still bad but not terrible.

She said it was just anxiety and my reports were not showing worseing hypertension. She said that if i had sustained 160s and 180s then over 10 years or even 1 year i would have developed LVH, vision problems, ECGs would have changed and kidney damage would have also taken place. Something would have pointed to the direction of persistent hypertension. She told me that i could start amlodipine in addition to my telmisartan 40 that i am taking but she said lets wait for a few days as meds are not prescribed for one reading.

after this i went to my family doctor who is a very very patient guy and know my anxiety issues and dosnt want to prescribe meds. He checked bp and it was 142/96 and he said that i can take an additional telmisartan dose today. However i knew it was anxiety and asked him to check my bp again and it was 130/76 in the second reading. He was surprised and told me not to take an additional med.

Now comes the part that i want to discuss. I measure my bp 100 times a day at home and have developed a compulsion of going to docs. However i am really really scared of a stroke and keep obsessing over it. I am in good shape otherwise- exercise for 2 hours everyday, squash, gym, tennis, swimming. Tests including treadmill test with a METS of 13.4 which is great acc to the doc.

I cant lose more weight as i am 5 feet 10 and 67. Looks like i have lost the genetic lottery when it comes to bp.

I dont drink or smoke and have been sober for the past 1 year or so. Have completely quit coffee as well. Idk what else to do.

I have also bought a manual sphygmomanometer and was wondering if kortokoff sounds start at the loud, clear sounds or if we take the faint heartbeats as well? If former is the case then my bp at home is around 130/80. If latter is the case then lol but most of the online tutorials have clear kortokoff sounds. My Omron monitors generally show a 10 mmhg difference and show a lower reading idk why but at the docs the reading of my Omron and what the doc read - 150/90 was exactly the same!!

My family doc says that diastolic is more important. What do you guys think?

Please help me and let me know how i can beat hypertension and if i should be really worried as i have heard that 180 can cause a stroke but docs say not at my age but i have read stories here stating that it has caused people in 20s a stroke. What do i do? Basically one cardiologist has just left the decision to me to start amlodipine or not. I have already been taking telmisartan for 10 years now.

I am 28

i started with bp meds at 18 with telmisartan + amlodipine but when i turned 25 i lost 40kgs and the doc removed amlodioine as my bp was 100/60. Since the past 4 years i am only on telmisartan.",1,1731515454.0,hypertension,1,1.0,False

after this i went to my family doctor who is a very very patient guy and know my anxiety issues and dosnt want to prescribe meds. He checked bp and it was 142/96 and he said that i can take an additional telmisartan dose today. However i knew it was anxiety and asked him to check my bp again and it was 130/76 in the second reading. He was surprised and told me not to take an additional med. 

Now comes the part that i want to discuss. I measure my bp 100 times a day at home and have developed a compulsion of going to docs. However i am really really scared of a stroke and keep obsessing over it. I am in good shape otherwise- exercise for 2 hours everyday, squash, gym, tennis, swimming. Tests including treadmill test with a METS of 13.4 which is great acc to the doc. 

I cant lose more weight as i am 5 feet 10 and 67. Looks like i have lost the genetic lottery when it comes to bp.

I dont drink or smoke and have been sober for the past 1 year or so. Have completely quit coffee as well. Idk what else to do. 

I have also bought a manual sphygmomanometer and was wondering if kortokoff sounds start at the loud, clear sounds or if we take the faint heartbeats as well? If former is the case then my bp at home is around 130/80. If latter is the case then lol but most of the online tutorials have clear kortokoff sounds. My Omron monitors generally show a 10 mmhg difference and show a lower reading idk why but at the docs the reading of my Omron and what the doc read - 150/90 was exactly the same!!

My family doc says that diastolic is more important. What do you guys think?

Please help me and let me know how i can beat hypertension and if i should be really worried as i have heard that 180 can cause a stroke but docs say not at my age but i have read stories here stating that it has caused people in 20s a stroke. What do i do? Basically one cardiologist has just left the decision to me to start amlodipine or not. I have already been taking telmisartan for 10 years now. 

I am 28

i started with bp meds at 18 with telmisartan + amlodipine but when i turned 25 i lost 40kgs and the doc removed amlodioine as my bp was 100/60. Since the past 4 years i am only on telmisartan. ",1,1731515355.0,bloodpressure,1,1.0,False

My dream is to buy a house one day, but I‚Äôm wondering how best I can do that, and I‚Äôm trying to see what I‚Äôm doing wrong. I grew-up low income, but my parents instilled some good financial values in me (immigrants who were incredibly frugal) so I‚Äôve already paid off a lot of my debts (paid off OSAP, which was a mistake in hindsight). Although I do acknowledge I spend more than I should in some places.

My income is approximately 150k a year, which after taxes, benefits, pension, etc, ends up being ~3800 bi-weekly depending on the time of year. Of that, my budget is as follows:

1. Mortgage: $2100 (recently renewed and extended my amortization to 30 years to keep payments low).
2. Property Tax: $220
3. Condo Fees: $805
4. Utilities (not included in fees): ~$60
 5. Insurance: $250 (car is paid off)
6. Gas: $250 
7. Support payment to parents: $500 (parents are both retired, but have a paid off house. They supported me when i was younger, so I try and help them out).
8. Groceries: ~$300 a month
9. Take-out: ~$300 a month
10. Coffee: ~$150 a month
11. Streaming Services: ~$30
12. Hair Cuts: $70 a month (2 hair cuts + tips)
13.Clothing: ~$50 (I usually buy my clothes in bulk, and keep them for 5+ years, so its tough to put a number here, but I spent ~400 this year so far).
14. Home Internet: $50
15. Cell Phone: ~110 (I pay for my plan and my parent‚Äôs plan)
16. Miscellaneous Spending: $100
17. Vacation/Travel: ~250 a month (I usually spend around $3000 a year travelling).
18. Gifts: $50 (I usually spend around $500 a year on gifts)
19. TTC: ~$10

Savings: ~70k

I save around $1500 a month, which barely feels like a dent when saving for a house. I‚Äôm in my early 30s, and my goal of owning a home and raising kids seems to be impossibly far away. I know the usual advice is to meet a partner and join your finances, but so far I haven‚Äôt met anyone making similar money to me in Toronto, it just seems like other people barely surviving, in worse shape then me.

I figure I could trim out my vacation budget, but honestly it feels so strange when everyone at my work place talks about going on lavish vacations and I‚Äôm the one bumpkin who has never left North America. I also can‚Äôt get rid of my car, as I drive it for work occasionally and to visit family in the GTA (taking transit would be 2-3 hours).

I don‚Äôt live luxuriously. I get a lot of take-out because I come home late from work. Don‚Äôt drink or smoke weed. Don‚Äôt buy luxury or designer. I work and then go to my small sky box and sleep.

What am I doing wrong? I really feel like I‚Äôm not going anywhere despite having a high income.",0,1731515212.0,PersonalFinanceCanada,59,0.38,False

1gqgp5s,https://www.reddit.com/r/toddlers/comments/1gqgp5s/i_am_at_my_breaking_point_with_my_3yo_toddler_i/,I am at my breaking point with my 3YO toddler. I need to know it‚Äôll be okay ,"I‚Äôm going to try to make this as cohesive as possible. We also have an almost 3 week old newborn so my brain is foggy, thoughts are jumbled, and I‚Äôm running on coffee. 

We have 2 toddler boys. One turned 3 in July and the other turns 2 this month. My 3 year old, I‚Äôm going to call him L, is driving me up a wall. Here are some of the things he is doing consistently:

-Starting fights with younger brother (I‚Äôm going to call him A). I know this is normal but I feel like it‚Äôs at an extreme level. He will walk by him and shoulder check him, or poke him in the face, or spit at him. Completely unprovoked. While playing, he‚Äôll take things out of his hands, throw things at him, and smash whatever A is building. -L will crowd his brother, push him out of the way, or not give him space when playing together. A handles all of this by reacting with a dramatic scream and loud cry every time, even if he wasn‚Äôt even touched, so we never know if someone is missing an eye or if he was just breathed on wrong. 
-Destructive behavior. Toys are rarely played with, instead they are thrown or dumped. He will tear apart books or just throw them all off of the book shelf instead of reading them. 
-Getting into things he knows he‚Äôs not allowed to do. We have a robot vacuum in the living room and he‚Äôll pick it up and toss it. Or he‚Äôll take a chair to be able to access the kitchen counter or sink. 
Overall, he never sits still or sits down to focus on something for long at all. He will sit down to play with PlayDoh but he wants to crumble it into little crumbs, getting it all over the floor. He likes coloring but after a minute or two he‚Äôll press down so hard with whatever he‚Äôs using that he breaks the marker or crayon. But these are things that require my supervision. I need them to be able to play on their own so I can do house tasks like dishes or cooking meals. 

Things that we‚Äôve tried to fix the issues:

-Taken away screen time completely. They‚Äôre never had a tablet but we used to watch a lot of TV. 3 weeks ago we took it away cold turkey. We did see a slight behavior improvement but today I had to turn a movie on so I could feed the baby. It didn‚Äôt hold their attention long though, and I will probably go back to keeping it off. 
-When L is mean to A, we ignore him and give all the attention to A. Afterward we talk to L and try to explain that what he did was wrong. This has not improved the behavior whatsoever. 
-We spoke with his pediatrician. She assured us this is normal behavior for a 3 year old and told us it‚Äôs time to implement time outs and consequences. Her example was ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre mean to your brother today, all of your cars are going to be taken away‚Äù. We‚Äôve been doing both for a few weeks now and it has not improved anything. He doesn‚Äôt seem to care that his toys are being taken away. As I type this, my husband just put him in a time out because they are sitting down coloring with markers and L wouldn‚Äôt stop coloring on my husband. He very nicely said a few times ‚ÄúI do not want to be colored on, please only color on paper‚Äù. After he wouldn‚Äôt listen, he was put in a time out but of course there was kicking and screaming to get him to go to the time out. 
-We have made sure to give him one on one time with each myself and my husband. And here‚Äôs the thing, he does great when he‚Äôs the only kid! Whether we take him somewhere or he stays home with one of us, he‚Äôs a great kid. No tantrums or behavior issues at all. It‚Äôs only when his brother is around that we see these issues. 
-We are in the process of enrolling him in part time pre school. The goal is a 3 day per week, 2.5 hour program to get him around other kids and out of the house. 
-I‚Äôve taken away most of their toys, especially the multi piece ones that they were just throwing away for the purpose of making a mess. I cycle them out so they have new toys to play with. I‚Äôve left them with legos, love every puzzles, so many cars and trucks, magnetiles, action figures, kid shopping carts. So they still have plenty to do. 
-Ive childproofed everything that I possibly can. But we live in a small 3 bedroom house where the kitchen and living room are on the same floor as the bedrooms, so there‚Äôs not a lot of space for them to play or run around. It‚Äôs also impossible to make everything safe when there‚Äôs no designated area for them except their small bedrooms. We have no play room so their toys are in the living room. We do have a fenced in back yard but it‚Äôs getting cold so it‚Äôs harder to utilize that, especially when I have to bundle of all 3 of the kids just to get out. 

I believe one contributing factor into these issues is that I used to take them both out of the house almost daily before I had the baby. The library, park, playground, zoo, grandmas house. Anywhere to get them out and wear them out. But now that we‚Äôre staying home, they‚Äôre bored. And they don‚Äôt know how to keep themselves busy.

I don‚Äôt know what I want to hear. That it‚Äôll get better, that this phase will pass, that I haven‚Äôt ruined my kids.

1gqglbx,https://i.redd.it/p11qbcc02p0e1.jpeg,The Power of Small Habits: How Tiny Changes Lead to Big Results,"
 Introduction:
In the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, it's easy to overlook the power of small habits. We often think that in order to make a difference, we need to make big, dramatic changes. But what if I told you that small, consistent actions could lead to significant transformation? Whether it‚Äôs improving your health, increasing productivity, or achieving your personal goals, it‚Äôs the little things that count.

In this post, we‚Äôll explore how making small, intentional changes in your daily routine can set the stage for long-term success.

1. Start Your Day with Purpose

The way you start your morning can set the tone for the rest of the day. While it's tempting to hit snooze and roll out of bed last minute, taking just a few moments to plan your day can make a world of difference. Whether it‚Äôs making your bed, having a cup of tea, or journaling for five minutes, starting your day with a simple routine can help you feel more grounded and ready to tackle whatever comes your way.

Pro Tip: Try setting an intention for the day. It could be something as simple as ""I‚Äôll stay positive,"" or ""I‚Äôll focus on my work without distractions."" This tiny change can drastically shift your mindset and focus.

2. Drink More Water

We all know how important hydration is for our health, but it‚Äôs easy to forget to drink enough water throughout the day. Drinking water not only boosts your energy levels, but it also helps improve your skin, digestion, and even mood.

Pro Tip: Start by setting a goal to drink one glass of water every hour. It‚Äôs a small habit that can quickly become part of your routine and have long-lasting benefits.

3. Break Tasks into Smaller Chunks

One of the easiest ways to feel overwhelmed is by looking at a big project or goal and thinking it‚Äôs too much to handle. But breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable pieces can make them feel less daunting. Instead of focusing on the entire task, focus on just one small action at a time.

Pro Tip: If you‚Äôre writing a blog post, start by writing just 100 words. That‚Äôs a small, achievable goal, and once you‚Äôve written 100 words, writing 100 more will feel much easier.

4. Practice Gratitude Daily

In our busy lives, it‚Äôs easy to focus on what's going wrong, but taking just a few moments each day to reflect on what‚Äôs going well can transform your mindset. Practicing gratitude helps shift your focus from scarcity to abundance, making you feel more positive and content.

Pro Tip: Every evening, write down three things you're grateful for. They don‚Äôt have to be big‚Äîanything from a warm cup of coffee to a kind word from a friend works. Over time, you‚Äôll start noticing more things to be grateful for each day.

5. Commit to Small Acts of Kindness

Kindness doesn‚Äôt have to be grand gestures. A simple compliment, holding the door for someone, or offering help when needed can brighten someone‚Äôs day‚Äîand yours. Small acts of kindness are not only good for others but also for your mental and emotional well-being.

Pro Tip: Set a goal to perform one act of kindness every day. It could be as simple as sending a positive message to a friend or helping someone with their groceries. The more you do, the more natural it becomes.

Conclusion:

It‚Äôs easy to get lost in the idea that success comes from big, bold moves. But the truth is, the most lasting transformations happen from the accumulation of small habits, practiced consistently over time. Whether it‚Äôs drinking more water, practicing gratitude, or breaking tasks down into smaller chunks, every small change you make is a step toward the bigger picture of success.

Start small, stay consistent, and watch how these tiny changes begin to create big results in your life.

The list of remedies that never worked is long, as is the list of remedies that worked for awhile but then stopped. I've been to a gastroenterologist and a nutritionist, tried the FODMAP diet, an elimination diet, prescriptions, prebiotics, postbiotics, supplements, a wide range of laxatives, the new vibrating pill (funny but didn't do a thing), ridiculous quantities of fiber, no dairy, tinctures, special exercises...They were all worth a try because they work for someone, and maybe they keep working for some people too.

I ended up finding something that works for me and it seems like a miracle so I'm posting about it in case it helps somebody else. I tried eating just one and not the other, but for me I need both. It's going to sound kind of weird! It is to me but it works and that's all that matters. Research supports the healthy impact they have on the gut (but then, that was true of most of the other stuff I tried too). 

1. Goat milk. I put it in my coffee and tea and sometimes drink it straight. (I tried no dairy, A2 milk, lactose free milk, split pea milk, other plant based milks before. Didn't make a difference.)

2. Yacon syrup. I put it in my coffee and tea (and yes I tried no caffeine for months, made no difference) also and have about three spoons a day. Apparently it's the most potent source of fructooligosaccharides. Why other sources of them don't help, I couldn't tell you. I buy the kind that supports schools in Lima Peru so benefits all around.

It took a few weeks but I could feel activity in my gut so I kept with them. I stopped when I was traveling and it took over a month to start working again. Now it's been a few months and that dreaded issue of not working isn't happening, I think because my gut is receiving what it needs to be healthy at long last and isn't being jump started from all the other stuff I had to take. Now fiber works the way it's supposed to too, whereas before it did nothing. Lentils, steel cut oatmeal, beans.

1gqgihd,https://www.reddit.com/r/women/comments/1gqgihd/encounter_with_creepy_neighbour/,Encounter with creepy neighbour ,"Hi just need a safe space to talk about what happened today as I'm 23F and live in the UK

Today I was waxing my car and spoke with some neighbours (from different households who are lovely), and then a particular male neighbour complimented my work and offered some tea. In good British fashion, I agreed for some tea. I've known this neighbour for years since I was a child, and I know he lives with his 'partner' (just found out they've separated) and lives with his DAUGHTERS. He seemed trustworthy?

So I walked into his home, and I agreed to have coffee. His home has lovely photos of his kids and all. A normal home. It appeared his family are away for work/school. I noticed how clumsy he was when making the coffee. He spilled the grounds, and spilled some coffee as he finished making it. His speech pattern was also erratic. I kept an eye on my drink to see that he didn't spike it. Thankfully nothing. But my gut feeling was keeping me vigilant. He was clearly drunk or on drugs.

So we continue to speak, he calls my mother beautiful and made heartfelt comments that she's a good woman. My mother and father are separated. He informed me that he and his partner broken up 2 years ago, but still live together. Yikes. He also told me he went to prison for drugs 3/4 years ago. Oop. He also offered me weed. No thank you. It was inappropriate personal life dumping. This man is in his mid-40s. I managed to lie to him that I had a meeting in 10 minutes with friends for business stuff. I looked at my phone and he commented that I have ""massive breasts"". What the absolute fuck. I affirmed that I needed to go, so he gave me a kiss goodbye on my head (Ew) and said our farewells. He knew me since I was a CHILD. I describe the encounter being with a 'creepy uncle', as they say. I only stayed there for like 10 mins.

A bit shaken up, not panicking, just a wtf encounter. I told my mum and sister what happened. I'm a bit worried as he lives across the street, but as it's a single narrow street all of my other neighbours can hear and see everything. That makes me feel a bit safer. I might talk to one of my lovely neighbours as she told me I can come to her if I have any issues. His family are such lovely people so I was shocked.

Thank you for listening 

Tldr; neighbour invited me for coffee, said yes. Creepy neighbour made comments about my mum, him went to prison for drugs, him offering me weed, and commenting about my ""massive breasts""",1,1731514445.0,women,0,1.0,False
