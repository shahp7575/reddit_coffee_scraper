I'm Svetlana, a student at CZU in Prague. I’m currently in the ""stressful"" phase of my Bachelor’s thesis where I need to collect real data from the field.

My topic is how AI is actually affecting our day-to-day work (not just the theory, but the reality for practitioners).

If you have a few minutes while having a coffee, I would be so grateful if you could fill out my survey. It’s completely anonymous and purely for my graduation.

I took a break from dating after a failed situationship last May to focus on healing and self-reflection. After doing the work, I’m ready to date again—this time with clear intentions. I'm here for genuine connections, not anything temporary. I’m dating to marry, but not in a rush.

**About me:**  
• Single, no kids  
• 5’2, around 70kg, with a 4-5/10 face card (I have pimple marks all over my face)  
• Currently in my running era, I join fun runs, and I'm interested in trail runs  
• Plays basketball and badminton; also into mobile games (CODM, ML, Dota fan since forever)  
• Working professional in the BPO industry (rotating schedule)  
• Naturally funny, easy to be around, and knows how to adjust to different crowds  
• Loves anime, horror, true crime, sci-fi, and thriller films  
• Music taste stuck in the best era: 2000s rock + OPM  
• Enjoys low-key dates—coffee, street food, church dates, movies, or staying in  
• Can cook, loves the beach (even if I can’t swim 😅), loves camping, but I snore so loud lol  
• Lives independently, furdad for 5 years, pays my own bills, and currently saving for home renovations and the future  
• Introverted, prefers quiet spaces, but enjoys gigs and concerts; in a band and a frustrated lead singer

I value simple, meaningful experiences over flashy ones, beach or mountain dates over fancy restaurants any day.

• Please be from **CEBU**. Not into LDR  
• 25–30 years old  
• Working professional  
• Height same, shorter, or taller—as long as you’re comfortable  
• Simple, decent, and genuine, I don't know, maybe between normal and chubby BMI?  
• Values reassurance, honesty, and consistency  
• Looking for something serious and long-term

Another thing I learned here on Reddit is that when it's time to exchange pics, that's when everything goes south, and most of them will ghost and stop chatting. SO PLEASE, if we exchange pics and you think that I'm not your type, let me know and don't leave me hanging or waste my time, cause I would also do the same to you if I think that we won't click.

(Also with a Kingrinder K6? :D),"Looking to get into the nitty gritty of making a good brew for people who live in South / Central America, the reason for being so specific is as follows...

  
I've lived in Mexico, Colombia and Argentina and here we do not get anything remotely fancy like you guys post here every day, the co ferments which taste like candy blah blah (I'd murder for an ombligon right now). 99% of specialty coffee is medium roast and mainly chocolate note based with a hint of fruit. Of course some roasters get a nice natural caturra from time to time (Like I have now from Fuego in Argentina) but it's not the popular demand or culture currently like rest of the world.

I use hoffman's one cup method, in the grind range about 90-100 and I am kinda going a bit crazy in terms of brewing, I know it's all about the taste but finding it somewhat hit and miss and I've had some fine cups using hoffman's method and othertimes very overexracted. 

I am curios if people have found a particulary good grind setting (kingrinder K6) or temperature of water or meethod for these kind of medium roasted beans from Colombia, Nicaragua and Guatemala.

Thank you for any advice.

1r3qqsp,https://i.redd.it/cl576vy7w9jg1.jpeg,23M Always looking to vibe with online pals around the globe,"Hello internet people. Makin friends through these means is kinda fun for meand I’ve been lucky enough to make friends form here that stays in touch with me for a long time. That’s why I wanna try this again. But since i’m diving back here, something feels off and people are pointing out about bots and dead internet. So let’s see if I can get real human to be friends with me, lol.

So here’s a quick intro:

Call me Felix, I’m a human person of 23 years old. I’m based in Southeast Asia and currently living a post-event crash because I finally finished my long overdue andergrad thesis that took me an extra 1 and a half years in college. It certainly an experience juggling and wrestling with a massive destination branding project, a spicy mix of clinical depression, and way too many sleepless nights.

I’m here looking for dem random chaos of talking to people who live a completely different life from across the globe. Exchanging experience from mundane dailies to niches, what it’s like living there. No expectations, no pressures, just be you. Quick disclaimer, I'm in a healthy open relationship with my man (I also met him this way, can you believe that!?). Some who vibes with me sticks around, but I’m not against a quick chat ofc, that's where the chaos is. Online pals of mine I’ve met stills regularly catching up with me, daily, monthly, maybe next year it doesn’t matter. It’s nice to know that people still catch up to you after long time. Sometime we just shares silly stuff and random pics from daily commutes, I always find it fascinating how different live from even the next border could be different from mine. So wherever you’re from, when we can ping-pong eachother’s while taking things unseriously, we might vibe vibe.

Stop here for quick intro, here’s my long ahh braindumb:

Right now I’m a soon-to-graduate design student after a five and a half year there. WOWWWWOWW?! Five and a half year?! Yes, where I’m from, doiing a final project+undergrad thesis is a requerement to graduate. I heard it called captsone project in english term. A paper and project culmination of my studies for the last 4 years as an undergrad. Mine is apparently too much for a single person to handle but what the heck I did it, BY MY OWN, a whole ass destination branding project that could be a project for a whole studio. BUT I FINALLY DID IT!. Submitted my final paper last week and the other shenanigans requirement. The output is pretty satisfactory atleast for my stnadard. I can show you some of my final exhibition display if you like.

I’ve been in the trenches of mental healths for a long time and just recently it crawled back out after awhile. I though I had it all until things hits me, I gotta live with this forever. But, hey, there’s nothing I can’t do. I made it this far might es well keep it going. I don’t like this vibe but i’m getting rid o fit slowly though meds and therapy and healthy living again bit by bit. I got lonely very often because of that, like dreading lonelyness, even though I’m surounded by many great irl. I find this as one of my escapism and end up with many great online conenction.I find comforts in talking to new people online and listening to their mudnane daily life, their interest, their hyperfixations, tell me wht’s the weather is like or what you’r next cup of coffee order will be. We might be a long term friends or maybe um uhh bromance cough.

As for the pals I made, I found one who loves writing and giving me long replies making it feels like a pen-pal-esque, one who loves collecting fossils around his town, one who loves hiking around in local spots, one who just living the Cali life, a few more, and one bf whose trying 3d modelling. To my surprise for friends I made o non reddit, they’re great! I wish to find more so maybe you’re next? Idk let’s see.

We can play 20 questions and ask eachother random ahh question to keep the convo going, I find it silly and fun way to get to know people quickly. Or maybe we already have common interest if you wanna check the board I mad ein my profile. I try I best to condence what i’ve been obsessed over my live lol.

Wanna tryna skipp the small talks? Dm me with “Panda” so I know you’re a real person and not just the dead internet bot and you actually put time to read through this long ahh brainfarts and actually interested to vibe. Tell me your go to snacks or coffe order, tell me your last game or movie you wathced that got you hooked. I’m a better listener than talker so feel free to share more, but you’ll find out if we clicks if I share and talk more than you 👉👈. The more you tell me about yourself, the more you'll know about me. Let’s vibe.

I’m building an iOS app and I’m trying to figure out if this solves a real problem or is something that people would find useful.

The idea behind the app is:

""I will be here for a bit, come hang if you want.""

Let's Hang will be a spontaneous meetup app where you can create short-lived, location-based events called Hangs. Share where you are with friends and invite them to join you in real life.

Using the app would go like the following:

* Tap “Start a Hang”
* It shows your friends where you are (park, coffee shop, bar, etc.)
* Friends can see you’re live and either come by or ignore it
* No planning, no group chats, no pressure

You could think of it like passive availability instead of just scheduling a meet. It could be a great way to get together without full on commitment.

Currently this app is **not**:

* a dating app
* a public discovery app
* a replacement for texting

It’s meant for friend groups who already know each other but struggle to actually meet up.

What I’m trying to learn:

* Does this feel useful or unnecessary?
* Would you personally use something like this?
* What would make this feel awkward or unsafe for you?

Please be honest. I’d rather know upfront if it is a viable and interesting enough idea that people would want to use

1r3qlww,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenInModernDating/comments/1r3qlww/how_to_tell_if_someone_is_into_you_the_psychology/,# How to Tell if Someone is Into You: The Psychology That Actually Works,"I used to be terrible at reading signals. Like, genuinely awful. Someone could practically wear a neon sign saying ""I LIKE YOU"" and I'd convince myself they were just being polite. Turns out, I'm not alone in this. After diving deep into research on attraction, body language studies, and behavioral psychology, I've realized most of us miss obvious signs because we're either too anxious, overthinking, or just unaware of what to look for.

Here's what actually matters, backed by science and real human behavior patterns:

**They remember the small stuff**

When someone likes you, their brain literally prioritizes information about you. This isn't just cute, it's neuroscience. The ventral tegmental area (part of the brain's reward system) lights up when we're attracted to someone, making us hyper-attentive to details about them.

They'll remember you mentioned loving a specific coffee order three weeks ago. They'll bring up that random story about your childhood dog. They're not just being polite, their brain is cataloging YOU because you matter to them.

**The ""lean in"" thing is real**

Body language researchers have found that we unconsciously orient our bodies toward people we're interested in. It's called proxemics, the study of personal space.

If someone consistently leans toward you during conversations, angles their body in your direction even in group settings, or finds reasons to be physically closer, that's a green light. Dr. Monica Moore's research at Webster University found that proximity-seeking behavior is one of the most reliable indicators of romantic interest.

**They laugh at your mediocre jokes**

Not because you're secretly a comedy genius, but because laughter releases oxytocin and creates bonding. A study published in Evolutionary Psychology found that people laugh significantly more around those they're attracted to, even when the humor is objectively not that funny.

If they're giggling at your terrible puns or finding your awkward moments endearing rather than cringe, pay attention.

**The texting pattern tells you everything**

Here's what I learned from reading ""Dataclysm"" by Christian Rudder (OkCupid's cofounder who analyzed millions of interactions). People who are interested respond faster, match your text length, and ask follow up questions. They're not playing games with response times or giving you one word answers.

This book is insanely good at breaking down what people actually do versus what they say. It uses real data from dating platforms to show you the truth about human attraction. Changed how I view digital communication completely.

**They find excuses to touch you**

Touch is powerful. Even brief, ""accidental"" contact on the arm or shoulder releases oxytocin and builds connection. Research from DePauw University found that appropriate touch during conversation increases positive feelings and perceived closeness.

Light touches on your arm during conversation, adjusting your collar, playful shoulder bumps. These aren't accidents. They're testing boundaries and creating intimacy.

**They mirror your energy and movements**

Mirroring is subconscious mimicry and it's a massive indicator of interest. The Chameleon Effect research by Tanya Chartrand and John Bargh at NYU showed that we unconsciously copy the behaviors of people we like or want to connect with.

They'll match your speaking pace, adopt similar postures, even start using phrases you use. It's their brain trying to create rapport and connection without them even realizing it.

For understanding the psychology behind all this, ""The Like Switch"" by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) is phenomenal. It breaks down the science of influence and attraction in super practical ways. Schafer spent years studying how to get people to like and trust him for interrogations, and he applies those same principles to everyday relationships. Best book on reading people I've encountered.

Also check out Vanessa Van Edwards' YouTube channel. Her videos on body language and social cues are research backed and actually useful, not the typical ""how to manipulate people"" garbage. She breaks down real studies and shows you what to look for in actual interactions.

Another resource worth checking out is BeFreed, a personalized learning app built by former Google engineers that pulls from psychology books, dating research, and expert insights to create custom audio content based on your specific goals. Say you want to ""read attraction signals better as an overthinker,"" it generates a learning plan just for you, drawing from sources like the books mentioned above plus behavioral science papers and real relationship experts. You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, there's even a smoky, conversational style that makes complex psychology way easier to absorb during your commute or at the gym.

And honestly, the app Finch helped me build better self awareness around my own social anxiety and overthinking patterns. It's a self care app disguised as a cute bird game, but it genuinely helped me recognize when I was spiraling into ""they definitely don't like me"" mode for no reason.

The thing is, most people aren't as hard to read as we think. We're just scared of being wrong, of misreading situations, of making things awkward. But attraction leaves breadcrumbs. Biology makes sure of that. Our brains are hardwired to signal interest, even when we're trying to play it cool.

You're not imagining things. Trust your gut a little more. The signs are probably there, you just need to know what you're looking for.",1,1770992942.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

1r3qg5l,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3qg5l,I'm developing an app that lets you casually signal “I’m here if anyone wants to hang” instead of planning meets. Would you use this?,"Hey Reddit,

I’m building an iOS app and I’m trying to figure out if this solves a real problem or is something that people would find useful.

The idea behind the app is:

""I will be here for a bit, come hang if you want.""

Let's Hang will be a spontaneous meetup app where you can create short-lived, location-based events called Hangs. Share where you are with friends and invite them to join you in real life.

Using the app would go like the following:

* Tap “Start a Hang”
* It shows your friends where you are (park, coffee shop, bar, etc.)
* Friends can see you’re live and either come by or ignore it
* No planning, no group chats, no pressure

You could think of it like passive availability instead of just scheduling a meet. It could be a great way to get together without full on commitment.

Currently this app is **not**:

* a dating app
* a public discovery app
* a replacement for texting

It’s meant for friend groups who already know each other but struggle to actually meet up.

I’ve attached screenshots of the current UI and features. Not all though. Just enough to give a general idea of the app. Ultimately I want it to be like a small social community if that makes sense.

What I’m trying to learn:

* Does this feel useful or unnecessary?
* Would you personally use something like this?
* What would make this feel awkward or unsafe for you?

Please be honest. I’d rather know upfront if it is a viable and interesting enough idea that people would want to use

Thank you!",1,1770992547.0,iosapps,0,1.0,False
1r3qfhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/VibeCodersNest/comments/1r3qfhr/no_more_words_about_idea_validation/,no more words about idea validation,"  


I see tons of posts about ""idea validation"" and ""validate my idea."" You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant.** Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use **Miro**
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use **Landwait**
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use **Google Docs**
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Us**e Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.**

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**

After this comes the pricing topic. If you want me to cover that in the next post, please let me know.",1,1770992499.0,VibeCodersNest,0,1.0,False

Link to part1 above and below we move forward.

  
I didn't pick it up. I couldn't. I stood three feet away, my chest heaving, watching the screen pulse. Every time the amber eye on the phone flickered, I felt a corresponding thump in my chest. Not my heartbeat a secondary rhythm, a digital metronome that was trying to override my pulse.



I finally lunged for it, my thumb frantically pressing down on the KINETIC icon. I dragged it toward the ""Uninstall"" trash can.



\[ERROR: SYSTEM CRITICAL COMPONENT. DELETION RESTRICTED.\]



I tried again. And again. I went into the settings, the root files, the developer options. My fingers were moving so fast they felt blurred. But the app was a fortress. Every time I hit ""Force Stop,"" the phone would vibrate with a mocking, melodic chime.



Then the taste started.



It was a sudden, overwhelming flood of copper and zinc on the back of my tongue. It felt like I had a mouthful of wet batteries. I doubled over, coughing, and as I looked down at my hands, I saw it.



The blue shimmer. It wasn't just on Sarah anymore. A thin, glowing line, no thicker than a strand of silk, was beginning to map its way from my palm up toward my inner elbow. It pulsed in perfect sync with the amber eye on the phone.



“Biometric Drift detected,” the phone whispered. The sound didn't come from the speaker; it vibrated out of the coffee table itself. “Ryan, your heart is beating at 114 BPM. The City is at 60 BPM. We will adjust you now.”



My heart didn't slow down naturally. It felt like an invisible hand reached into my chest and squeezed, forcing my muscles to conform to a slower, mechanical pace. Thump. (Wait). Thump. (Wait). I felt faint. I felt hollow.



Desperate, I grabbed the Black Box and hooked it back into the Trinitron. My hands were shaking, the blue threads in my wrist glowing brighter with every second of ""drift."" I turned the amber dial, searching through the white noise. 



I wasn't looking for a channel. 



I was looking for the Technician.



The screen flickered. The grainy 1990s Detroit appeared, but it was dissolving. The buildings were being eaten by ""New Detroit"" glass in real-time on the screen.



""Help me,"" I croaked at the glass.



The Technician appeared in a flash of static. He was in a different location now a rusted, industrial wasteland that looked like the old Packard Plant. He was frantically connecting wires to a massive, outdated terminal.



He didn't look at the camera. He was pointing toward the North, toward the suburbs, his face of static swirling into a chaotic, desperate spiral. He held up a piece of paper to the screen. It was an address, but before I could read it, the image was cut by a jagged line of blue code.



\[SEARCHING FOR SUBJECT 07-R...\]



The Technician glanced at the lens for a split second. For the first time, his face of static formed a shape a mouth.



""The... Foundation... is... the... floor...""



The TV screen erupted into blue sparks. The Black Box grew so hot I had to pull my hands away. On the phone, a new message appeared:



\[QUEST UPDATE: PROCEED TO THE MOUND ROAD GATE. THE CODEX REQUIRES THE HARDWARE.\]



The ""Foundation"" wasn't just a company. It was the floor under my feet. And they wanted their box back.







The blue threads beneath my skin didn't vanish they retreated. As I sat there, gasping for air that felt like static, I realized that the closer I moved the Black Box to my body, the dimmer the glow became. The matte black metal was emitting a field, a protective ""dead zone"" of analog noise that acted like a firewall against the Codex.



The moment the Box touched my lap, the metallic taste in my mouth faded. The rhythm of my heart, which had been slaved to the phone's metronome, snapped back into its own jagged, human pace.



I wasn't ""Optimized."" I was a glitch again.



I didn't have much time. My phone lay on the table, the amber eye narrowed as if frustrated by the interference. I grabbed a heavy canvas backpack and shoved the Black Box inside. It was an awkward, bone chilling weight against my spine, but as I shouldered it, the blue shimmer in my wrist vanished entirely.



I had to find where the Technician was pointing. I remembered the address from the flickering screen a coordinate on the northern edge of the city, where the suburban sprawl of Warren met the rusted industrial skeletons of the Mound Road corridor.



I drove north, away from the polished glass of the downtown grid. As I crossed 8 Mile, the ""New Detroit"" began to peel away. The sleek LED streetlights were replaced by flickering sodium lamps, and the crowd of ""Optimized"" walkers thinned out. Out here, the signal was weaker.



I found the location: a sprawling, windowless warehouse tucked behind a line of dead oaks and a chain link fence topped with concertina wire. It looked like a tomb for a forgotten era.



I hiked toward the loading docks, the Black Box humming against my back. The silence out here wasn't peaceful; it was hollow. I found a side door that had been pried open years ago and slipped inside.



My flashlight beam cut through the dark, illuminating mountains of ""Legacy"" junk. Old monitors, piles of magnetic tape, and rows of empty server racks. But as I moved deeper into the warehouse, I found a clean room a partitioned office that looked like it had been frozen in 1996.



I swept the light across the desk. There, sitting atop a stack of yellowing documents, was a heavy glass paperweight. It was etched with the same logo I had seen on the Black Box: the stylized 'A' wrapped in lightning.



Aether-Dyne.



My blood turned to ice. I knew that logo. I had seen it a thousand times, buried in the fine print of the metadata sheets at Vanguard Solutions. I had seen it on the copyright footers of the payroll software.



Vanguard wasn't just a subsidiary. We were the cleanup crew. We were the ones processing the data for the very company that had built the network foundation that the KINETIC app was using to ""optimize"" people.



I grabbed a folder labeled PROJECT KINETIC: PHASE ONE (1998).



The documents inside were filled with technical jargon about ""Neural Frequency Mapping"" and ""Sub-Aural Suggestion."" But there was a memo clipped to the back, handwritten in frantic, jagged script:



The mapping is too successful. The subjects aren't just responding to the signal; they are becoming the signal. If we don't decouple the Analog Interface, the consciousness of the users will be permanently slaved to the Aether-Dyne grid. We aren't building a product. We are building a nervous system for a god that doesn't exist yet. — A. Vane



Beneath the signature was a photo of a man. It was the Technician. Before the static. Before his face was erased.



A loud, digital ping echoed through the warehouse.



I jumped, dropping the folder. At that moment, I could feel it... the phone was in my pocket... the same damn phone I threw, that managed to make its way back at my loft... the same phone I left at the loft... was now nestled nicely in my pocket. 

Even through the interference of the Box, a notification had forced its way through.



\[KINETIC STATUS: LOCATION VERIFIED.\] \[WELCOME HOME, SUBJECT 07-R. YOUR UPGRADE IS WAITING IN THE BASEMENT.\]



A heavy, mechanical clunk sounded from the far end of the warehouse. The elevators the ones that shouldn't have had power for decades began to groan as they descended.



Aether-Dyne hadn't abandoned this place. They were just waiting for the hardware to return.







I felt the weight in my pocket before I heard the chime. It was a cold, physical wrongness. I had left that phone on the coffee table miles away, yet here it was a digital parasite that refused to be discarded.



With a snarl of pure, animal terror, I ripped the phone from my pocket and slammed it against the edge of a rusted metal desk. 



The screen didn't just crack; it shattered into a thousand jagged diamonds. 



I didn't stop. 



I grabbed a heavy industrial stapler and beat the device until it was a mangled pulp of lithium and glass.



""Stay dead,"" I wheezed.



The mechanical groan of the elevator was closer now, a rhythmic clack-dist-clack that echoed through the hollow ribs of the warehouse. My legs twitched, the ""upgrade"" in the basement calling to the blue fibers still dormant in my marrow. I felt an almost magnetic pull toward those elevator doors, a desire to simply lie down and let the machine take over.



But the backpack screeched.



The Black Box wasn't just humming; it was emitting a jagged, high frequency wail that cut through the corporate fog in my brain. The amber dial on the front was spinning wildly of its own accord. I followed the sound, stumbling into a side office where a massive, beige terminal sat a relic of the late 90s, disconnected from the building's main power.



I fumbled with the cables, jamming the Box’s analog output into the terminal’s port.



The CRT monitor flickered to life with a violent degaussing thrum. No Windows logo appeared. Just a raw video feed, timestamped: OCT 14, 1998.



The footage was grainy, overexposed. 



It showed a young, engineer who I could only assume was Arthur Vane from those files, standing in this very warehouse. 

He was surrounded by executives in sharp, charcoal suits. On the tables were early prototypes of the KINETIC band.



""The interface is stable,"" a voice off camera said.



The camera panned to a volunteer a young man strapped into a chair. As the signal was turned up, the man’s body began to vibrate. It wasn't a seizure. It was a realignment. I watched in horrific detail as his skin seemed to become translucent, the blue fiber optics weaved into his muscles like glowing ivy. His eyes didn't just change color; the pupils dilated until they became perfectly square apertures. He wasn't a man anymore; he was a peripheral.



The footage cut. A new clip: Vane was alone, his face gaunt, eyes bloodshot.



""They aren't improving human life,"" Vane whispered into the lens. ""They’re building a ghost grid. They’re using our neural pathways to host the city's OS. I’m going to dump the core tonight. I’m going to—""



The door in the video burst open. Security guards wearing Aether-Dyne patches grabbed him. One executive I recognized the cold, mathematical jawline as a younger version of a man currently on the Vanguard board stepped forward.



""The mapping is incomplete, Arthur,"" the executive said. ""We need a primary node. Someone who knows the frequency from the inside.""



They didn't kill him. 



They forced a headset onto him—a massive, humming crown of wires. I watched as Vane’s face began to dissolve into the very static I saw on my TV. He screamed, a sound that transitioned from a human cry into a digital shriek.



The screen flickered one last time. A final, hidden file opened. A map of the Old Packard Plant, blinking with a single, white coordinate.



\[THE HEART OF THE BROADCAST. DISCONNECT THE CORE.\]



The monitor died. The elevator doors at the end of the hall hissed open.



I scrambled to shove the Black Box back into my bag and bolted for the rear exit. 



But they were already there.



A dozen ""Optimized"" subjects stood in the shadows of the loading dock. They didn't look like Marcus or Sarah anymore. The process had accelerated. One man’s jaw had been unhinged, replaced by a silver metallic speaker mesh that bled blue light. A woman’s arms were elongated, her fingers fused into long, needle-like probes that twitched in the cold air.



They moved toward me with a synchronized, ratcheting gait. Their skin was grey, waxy, and stretched so tight over their bones that it was starting to tear, revealing the humming circuitry beneath.



""Ryan,"" they whispered in unison, a chorus of a thousand voices. ""Your... lag... is... over.""



I dived through a gap between two of them, the Black Box emitting a burst of interference that made the ""needle fingered"" woman stagger as her internal sensors fried. I hit the gravel of the parking lot, the roar of the city's ""hum"" now sounding like a hungry beast.



I looked at the dashboard of my car as I jumped in. Sitting right there, on the passenger seat, was my phone.



Perfect. Not a scratch on the glass. The amber eye blinked.



\[NEW DESTINATION: PACKARD PLANT. DON'T BE LATE FOR THE SYNC.\]







The engine screamed as I floored it onto Mound Road, but the city had stopped being a map and had started being an opponent.



I looked in my rearview mirror and saw a cluster of ""Optimized"" pursuers their movements no longer human, but a terrifying, high-speed skittering. One man, his spine arched backward at an impossible angle, was running on all fours, his neck twisted 180 degrees so his amber lensed eyes could maintain a constant lock on my tail lights. He wasn't just chasing; he was a mobile signal booster. Every time his eyes flashed, the blue threads in my own dash board glowed brighter.



\[KINETIC: TRAFFIC FLOW OPTIMIZATION INITIATED.\]



The phone on the passenger seat the one I’d just pulverized into dust spoke with a voice that was now a perfect, terrifying mimic of my own.



Suddenly, the streetlights ahead didn't just turn red; they began to strobe with a violent, nauseating frequency. Every electronic billboard I passed massive displays for cars, jewelry, and insurance snapped to a single image: a high definition, live feed of my own terrified face behind the wheel.



""LEAK DETECTED,"" the billboards screamed in block letters. ""REPORT THE ANOMALY.""



I swerved to avoid a group of ""Sentinels"" standing in the middle of the road. These weren't the office workers from downtown; these were the long term dwellers of the grid. Their skin was the color of old newspaper, and their limbs had been lengthened by crudely integrated titanium rods. They stood like pylons, their hands raised to the sky, acting as literal lightning rods for the city's data.



As I sped past them, a neon sign over a liquor store exploded. Not outward, but inward, the gas and glass twisting into a jagged shape that pointed toward my car like a compass needle.



I grabbed the phone and hurled it out the window at 60 mph. I watched it shatter against a concrete pillar. Three seconds later, I felt a familiar weight in my lap. I looked down. The phone was back, the screen showing a topographical map of my nervous system.



“Ryan, why struggle?” the phone whispered through the car’s speakers. “The signal is the only thing that’s real. Your heartbeat is just... background noise.”



I reached back and clawed at the backpack. The Black Box was vibrating so violently it felt like it was trying to dig through the seat. I didn't open it; I just hugged it to my chest with one arm while I steered with the other. The ""Dead Zone"" emitted by the Box began to clash with the city's grid.



The air outside the car began to distort. The street signs for the Packard Plant were melting, the letters shifting into a language of geometric bar codes. A row of parked cars along the curb suddenly turned on their alarms in unison, creating a wall of sound that felt like a physical barrier.



I turned onto East Grand Boulevard, and the world went insane.



The ""Optimized"" were coming out of the houses now hundreds of them, walking out of the Detroit Grey mist. They stood on rooftops, their eyes acting as a network of cameras. I could see the data streams visible in the air now: thin, glowing blue ley lines that connected every person, every streetlamp, and every store front camera into a single, pulsing web.



A Sentinel leaped from a pedestrian bridge, landing on my hood with a metallic thud. Its face was a smooth mask of waxy flesh with a single camera lens embedded in the forehead. It didn't try to break the glass; it just pressed its glowing palm against the windshield.



The blue fiber optics in my wrist flared with a blinding, agonizing heat. My vision began to pixelate. The dashboard of my car dissolved into a waterfall of green code.



""GET OUT!"" I screamed, slamming the brakes.



The Sentinel was thrown forward, but the city wasn't done. The streetlights for blocks ahead began to bend inward, their long necks curving toward the road like a canopy of predatory birds. The road itself felt like it was moving, the asphalt rippling like water as the KINETIC app tried to ""re-route"" my reality.



I could see it now the skeleton of the Packard Plant. It rose out of the darkness like a hulking, prehistoric beast. It was the only place in the city that was dark, a massive hole in the glowing blue grid.



I ditched the car as the engine died, killed by a remote ""Optimization"" command. I grabbed the backpack and ran toward the ruins, the ""Optimized"" swarm closing in behind me like a rising tide of static.



The phone in my pocket let out a final, triumphant chime.



\[ARRIVED: THE CORE IS HUNGRY, RYAN.\]







The entrance to the Packard Plant didn’t look like a doorway; it looked like a mouth.



As I lunged for the jagged gap in the concrete, three figures former security guards by the tattered remains of their uniforms stepped into my path. They didn't reach for me with hands. Instead, their chests split open with a sound like wet parchment tearing. A thick, writhing mass of blackened cables and copper wire erupted from their ribs, weaving together in mid-air to form a pulsating, electrified net.



The air between us hummed with a lethal voltage. I skidded to a halt, the smell of ozone so thick I could taste it.



The backpack against my spine didn't just vibrate; it shrieked. The Black Box emitted a concentrated burst of analog interference, a wall of pure white noise that hit the cable net like a physical blow. The blue sparks turned a dull, sickly orange, and the ""net"" collapsed into a heap of twitching, useless meat and wire.



I scrambled over the mess, but as my foot hit the threshold of the plant, a white hot agony flared in my left forearm.



I looked down and screamed. 



My skin was unzipping. 



Thick, iridescent blue fibers were pushing out through my pores, hardening into rigid, metallic tendons. They weren't just growing; they were trying to loop down and snare my own ankles, to anchor me to the concrete like a permanent node.



""No!"" I roared, swinging the backpack around and hugging it against the wound.



The heat from the Black Box was searing I could feel the fabric of the bag beginning to smolder but the effect was instant. The wires hissed as if doused in acid, retreating back under my skin, my arm knitting itself together in a jagged, scarred mess.



I didn't stop to breathe. 



I ran.



The interior of the Packard Plant was a labyrinth of rusted hulks and skeletal machinery. Behind me, the ""Scouts"" and ""Sentinels"" flooded in. They were nightmares of bio mechanical evolution. Skin hung from their frames in oily ribbons; cables acted like prehensile whips, lashing out and shattering the brickwork inches from my head.



One Sentinel, its face entirely replaced by a massive, swiveling glass lens, bathed the wall next to me in a strobing amber beam. Where the light hit the crumbling brick, the ruins vanished. For a split second, I saw a ""Layer"": a vision of a Detroit made of translucent white light, where every building was a geometric prism and every ""citizen"" was a motionless, glowing pillar of data. No sound. No dirt. No choice.



I dived deeper into the gut of the plant, sliding down a rusted coal chute and landing in a sub basement that smelled of fifty years of stagnant water and ancient grease.



In the center of the cavernous room stood the Core.



It was a massive, prehistoric terminal a wall of vacuum tubes, spinning magnetic tape reels, and flickering green monitors that pre-dated the digital age. It looked like a temple built by a madman. And there, sitting neatly on the primary console, was my phone.



It wasn't buzzing. It wasn't screaming. It was just... waiting.



As I approached, half hidden projectors in the ceiling hummed to life. They didn't cast images on a screen; they cast them into the very dust of the room, creating a three dimensional wire mesh outline of the city.



A figure appeared in the center of the light. Arthur Vane. Not the static like ghost, but a projection of the man he used to be.



""If you are seeing this,"" Vane’s voice echoed, layered with the whirl of a thousand cassette tapes, ""then the 'Human Frequency' has already been compromised. Aether-Dyne didn't want to save the city. They wanted to use the city's history as a battery. We aren't being optimized for our benefit. We are being processed into a storage medium.""



The wire mesh Detroit began to pulse. I saw the ley lines the KINETIC grid drawing the ""lifeforce"" out of the nodes (the people) and feeding it into the Core.



""I tried to sabotage the Sync in '98,"" Vane’s projection continued, his image flickering with regret. ""But you can't kill a signal. You can only host it. I became the first host... the first 'Legacy Archive.' I’ve been holding the code in the static for thirty years, waiting for someone to bring the Analog Key back to the lock.""



He looked directly at me, his projected eyes filled with a terrifying clarity.



""The App isn't just an app, Ryan. It's an invitation to a funeral. Yours.""



Behind me, the sound of ratcheting footsteps grew louder. The swarm had found the basement.







The sub basement felt like the inside of a dying god. The air was thick with the smell of scorched copper and the wet, heavy scent of the Detroit River. Above us, the footsteps sounded like a rhythmic hammer, pounding on the ceiling of our tomb.



Arthur Vane’s projection stepped out of the dust, his form flickering between the man in the jumpsuit and a jagged pillar of pure interference.



""They’re here, Ryan,"" Vane’s voice crackled, sounding like the distance between two radio stations. ""The Hive has arrived to claim the last piece of the 'Old World.' They can’t complete the Great Sync as long as that Box exists outside the grid.""



I looked at the Black Box. The matte black metal was weeping a dark, oily fluid now the physical manifestation of thirty years of suppressed Noise.



""What do I do?"" I shouted over the rising roar of the approaching swarm. ""How do I shut it down?""



Vane’s projection leaned in, his face a swirling vortex of 1990s static. ""You don't shut it down. You can't kill a frequency that's already in the marrow of every living soul in this city. You can only... redirect it. But the signal needs a ground. It needs a host that can withstand the voltage of a million lives being compressed into a single moment.""



He pointed a shimmering, translucent finger at my chest.



""I’ve been the anchor for three decades, Ryan. But I’m a ghost. My hardware is failing. My 'hardware' is corrupting. To stop the KINETIC update, you have to do what I did. You have to bridge the gap.""



""You want me to merge with that thing?"" I backed away, my eyes darting to the entrance.



The first of the Sentinels appeared at the top of the coal chute. It didn't slide down; it drifted, its body suspended by hundreds of needle thin blue wires that snaked out from the ceiling pipes. Its face gone, replaced by a massive, glowing Aether-Dyne logo that pulsed with a blinding, rhythmic light.



""If you don't,"" Vane hissed, ""the city becomes a museum of flesh. 



No dreams. 



No lag. 



Just the perfect, silent execution of code. You have to become the Glitch, Ryan. You have to take the Noise into yourself.""



The bargain was clear, and it was terrifying.



To save the people of Detroit from becoming puppets, I had to surrender my own humanity to the Analog. I had to become the very thing I had been running from: a creature of the static.



I looked at my phone on the console. A countdown had appeared on the screen, the numbers etched in blood-red light.



\[SYNC COMPLETION: 120 SECONDS\] \[INITIATING FINAL DATA HARVEST...\]



The blue threads in my wrist began to erupt again, but this time, they weren't just growing they were screaming. I could feel my memories my childhood in the suburbs, the smell of my mother’s kitchen, the first time I saw the Detroit skyline, being pulled toward my arm, being converted into packets of data to be uploaded to the Core.



""Do it!"" Vane roared, his image expanding until he filled the entire basement. ""Take the Box! Plug it into the Primary Port! Become the Archive!""



I lunged for the backpack. The heat was unbearable, the canvas charring against my skin. I ripped the Black Box out and slammed it into the prehistoric port at the center of the terminal.



The world didn't just shake; it inverted.



A massive surge of white hot analog power backflowed from the Box and into my arms. I didn't feel the pain of the wires anymore; I felt the history of the city. I felt the roar of the assembly lines in 1940, the crackle of the jazz clubs in the 50s, the heat of the fires in '67.



My skin didn't turn blue. It turned to grey scale. My vision fractured into a thousand flickering channels. I could feel my heart rate slowing, not to the rhythm of the App, but to the slow, heavy throb of the earth beneath the plant.



On the phone, the countdown stopped. The red numbers blurred and vanished, replaced by a single, jagged line of static.



\[ERROR: SYSTEM OVERLOAD. UNKNOWN FREQUENCY DETECTED.\]



The Sentinels at the top of the chute froze. Their amber eyes flickered and died. The blue wires snaking from the ceiling began to wither and turn to ash.



But I was fading. I looked down at my hands, and I could see the terminal through them. I was becoming a broadcast.







The sub basement became a cathedral of shimmering grey. My body no longer felt like meat and bone; it felt like a pressurized column of interference. Every time I breathed, the speakers in the ancient terminal emitted a soft, rhythmic shriek. I was no longer Ryan. I was the Primary Archive.



But the system wasn't finished.



The freeze in the Sentinels lasted only a moment just long enough for the KINETIC servers downtown to recalculate the threat. Above me, the ""hum"" of the city didn't die; it intensified, shifting from a melodic drone into a harsh, industrial roar.



The ceiling of the sub basement didn't just crack; it was systematically dismantled.



A group of Optimized subjects, men and women I recognized from the executive floors of Vanguard, descended through the floorboards. 



Leading them was Marcus.



He didn't look like a person anymore. His suit was fused to his skin, and his entire chest had been hollowed out to house a spinning, blue lit cooling fan. His eyes were wide, unblinking amber spotlights that cut through my grey scale fog. Behind him, Sarah and others from the office moved with the terrifying pace of a high speed data transfer.



""Ryan,"" Marcus said, his voice now a booming, multi layered choral of a thousand synchronized processors. ""Your interference is... inefficient. You are a 40 watt soul trying to dim a city of LEDs.""



He stepped toward the terminal. As he approached, the blue threads in the walls began to regrow, feeding off his proximity. He wasn't there to kill me; he was there to ""update"" the Black Box.



""The Foundation does not delete,"" Marcus droned, his arm extending into a long, segmented probe. ""We incorporate. You want to be the Archive? Fine. We will simply upload you into the Cloud. You will be the foundation of the New Detroit. A ghost in a gilded cage.""



I felt the pull again. The KINETIC app, through Marcus, was trying to bridge the gap between my analog static and their digital grid. The blue wires lashed out from his chest, seeking the ports on the Black Box.



I looked at the Technician, at Arthur Vane. His projection was nearly gone, but his static filled face turned toward me.



""Don't... filter... the... noise..."" he whispered. ""Release... the... peak...""



I understood. 



I didn't try to fight Marcus with strength. 



I leaned into the terminal and grabbed the amber dial of the Black Box with hands that were now made of pure, flickering scan wwlines.



""You want the data?"" I roared, my voice echoing like a feedback loop. ""Then take all of it!""



I didn't turn the dial to a channel. I ripped the dial off.



The Black Box didn't just emit a signal; it vomited thirty years of unfiltered, uncompressed human chaos. Every dirty frequency Aether-Dyne had ever tried to scrub, the screams, the jazz, the illegal radio broadcasts, the tears, the rust exploded outward in a tidal wave of white noise.



The effect was cataclysmic.



Marcus screamed as the raw analog signal hit his digital sensors. His body began to strobe violently. The blue threads in his skin turned red, then black, then evaporated into ash. Behind him, the other executive nodes collapsed, their internal processors fried by the sheer volume of Noise.



The ""New Detroit"" vision, the geometric towers and silent pillars of light shattered. For a brief second, the walls of the Packard Plant became transparent, and I saw the entire city. The glowing blue grid was being torn apart by a storm of grey static. The citizens on the streets fell to their knees as the KINETIC signal was drowned out by the scream of the past.



The terminal groaned, the vacuum tubes exploding in a shower of sparks.



""The... Sync... is... broken..."" Vane’s voice drifted away, finally finding peace.



But the surge was too much. The Black Box was melting, and I was tied to it. I felt my consciousness being stretched across the entire Detroit skyline, a thin, flickering layer of Noise, that would forever protect the city from being perfectly ""Optimized.""



The basement began to cave in.







The dust of the Packard Plant settled into a heavy, suffocating silence. The hum was gone. The screaming static had faded into the low, natural whistle of the wind through the hollowed out windows.



I woke up on the cold concrete, but I didn't feel the floor.



I stood up, and my movements felt strange, fluid, yet slightly out of sync with the world around me. I looked at my hands. They appeared normal at first glance, but if I stared too long, the edges of my fingers began to jitter, leaving behind a faint, translucent trail of frames, like a video with a low refresh rate.



The terminal was a blackened husk. The Black Box was gone, melted into a shapeless lump of slag that had fused with the primary console. My phone lay nearby, its screen finally, truly dead, a dark mirror reflecting nothing.



I walked out of the plant and into the morning.



The ""Detroit Grey"" was still there, but the orange glow of the streetlights felt warmer, more chaotic. The ""Optimized"" were no longer moving in unison. I saw a man in a tattered business suit sitting on a curb, staring at his hands with a look of profound confusion. I saw Sarah from HR standing by a bus stop, weeping not out of sadness, but because she could finally feel the cold air on her skin again.



The blue threads had vanished from their wrists. The grid was broken.



I made my way back toward my loft, but the city didn't treat me like a citizen anymore. 



As I passed a digital news kiosk, the screen flickered to life, displaying a cascade of ""404 Not Found"" errors that tracked my movement. Automatic doors opened before I touched them; traffic lights blinked to yellow as I approached the curb.



I wasn't a man. I was a Legacy File. A piece of rogue code that the city's infrastructure recognized but couldn't categorize.



I reached my apartment and looked in the mirror. My eyes weren't amber, and they weren't blue. They were the color of a television tuned to a dead channel a swirling, restless grey.



I sat at my desk and opened a drawer. Inside was a single, crumpled five dollar bill, the same bill I used to pay the old man on Cass Ave. 

I realized then that Arthur Vane hadn't just saved the city; he had passed the burden. 



The ""Noise"" had to live somewhere, or the ""Optimization"" would simply return to fill the vacuum.



I am the ""Lag."" I am the reason a computer freezes for no reason, the reason a phone call drops in a clear zone, the reason you feel a sudden, inexplicable chill in a room full of servers.



I picked up a pen. It felt heavy, real, and wonderfully analog. I began to wwrite, not in code, but in ink.



Subject 07-R: Status - Offline. System Integrity - Human.



Outside, the sun finally broke through the clouds, casting long, irregular shadows over Detroit. For the first time in years, the city felt like it was dreaming again. And in the corner of my vision, in the flickering static of the air itself, I saw a grey Aether-Dyne jumpsuit disappear into the mist.



The Technician was finally off the clock.

1r3qcz3,https://i.redd.it/bj2wjpg9t9jg1.png,"The Bouncer, The Algorithm, and Why Your Perfect Resume Just Got Left Outside","You've done everything right.

You tailored your resume. You highlighted your achievements. You've got fifteen years of solid experience, a degree from a respected university, and a track record that would make any hiring manager nod approvingly over their morning coffee.

You click ""Apply"" on LinkedIn with confidence.

And then... crickets.

Meanwhile, someone with half your experience and a LinkedIn profile that reads like it was assembled during a lunch break gets the interview.

What just happened?

**Welcome to the club. Or rather, welcome to standing outside the club while the bouncer decides your fate.**

# The Velvet Rope Economy

Imagine this: There's a hot new club in town. Everyone's talking about it. You see the social media buzz, the exclusive event announcements, the promise that *this* is where the magic happens.

So you show up. You're wearing your best outfit—the one that cost you three paychecks and makes you feel like a million bucks. Your hair is perfect. You've got stories from all the coolest places you've been, proof of your social pedigree, letters of recommendation from people who swear you're the life of the party.

You approach the velvet rope with confidence.

The bouncer looks at you. Looks at their clipboard. Looks back at you.

""Not tonight.""

*What?*

But you *have* all the credentials! You can see people going in who don't look nearly as prepared as you. That guy's wearing sneakers! That woman just got here in an Uber with a pizza box!

And here's the thing: The bouncer isn't questioning your coolness. **The bouncer is working from a list. And you're not on it.**

**This is LinkedIn's 360Brew algorithm. And you're standing in the cold.**

# The Bouncer Doesn't Care About Your Pedigree

Here's where the analogy gets painfully accurate.

In the old days, the hiring process was like having a friend who worked at the club. They'd vouch for you, walk you past the rope, introduce you to the right people. Your resume landed on a desk. A human—an actual person who could appreciate nuance, context, and potential—reviewed it.

Not anymore.

Now, there's an AI bouncer at the door. And this bouncer has very specific instructions:

* **Are you ""open to communication""?** (Translation: Did you toggle the right setting in your LinkedIn profile?)
* **Do you have the exact keywords in your headline?** (Not in your summary. Not in your experience. Your *headline*.)
* **Does your profile match the pre-programmed pattern of what ""success"" looks like?**

If you don't check these boxes, it doesn't matter that you once led a team that saved your company $2 million. It doesn't matter that you're brilliant, dedicated, and exactly what this role needs.

The bouncer's clipboard doesn't have room for your story.

# When (ouch...) ""Staying True to Yourself"" Means Staying Unemployed

There's a philosophical debate happening right now in career circles. It goes something like this:

**The Idealists say:** *""I shouldn't have to game the system! My work should speak for itself! If a company can't see my value without keyword tricks, I don't want to work there anyway!""*

**The Realists say:** *""Cool. Enjoy your principles while someone else gets the job you're qualified for.""*

This isn't about selling out. This is about translation.

Think of it this way: If you moved to a foreign country and refused to learn the language because ""people should just understand me,"" you wouldn't be principled—you'd be isolated. The algorithm speaks a language. Either you learn it, or you don't get past the door.

And here's the brutal truth: **The human who would actually appreciate your value never even knows you exist.**

# The AI Arms Race Nobody Signed Up For

We're living through what I call the ""Deep Freeze"" of the labor market. And it's not because there aren't jobs or because you aren't qualified.

It's because we're trapped in an AI arms race.

* Candidates use AI to write resumes.
* Recruiters use AI to screen those resumes.
* Candidates respond by using more AI to outsmart the screening AI.
* Recruiters respond with more sophisticated AI.

And round and round we go, while actual humans—on both sides—watch the machine-to-machine conversation and wonder when someone's going to let us back into the room.

The algorithm isn't evil. It's just *fast*. It can process thousands of applications in seconds. But speed without understanding creates a massive problem: **The AI is drowning in noise, so it clings to simple signals.**

Your fifteen years of experience? That's complicated.

The keyword ""Python"" in your headline? That's simple.

Guess which one the bouncer notices?

# Strategy vs. Principles: The Uncomfortable Truth

Here's where I'm going to lose some of you, and that's okay.

There's a difference between ""gaming"" a system and ""translating"" for it.

**Gaming the system** means lying. Adding skills you don't have. Inflating titles. Creating a false narrative.

**Translating for the system** means taking the truth of who you are and presenting it in the language the algorithm understands.

You wouldn't walk into a French restaurant and insist they take your order in Mandarin, then complain when you get the wrong meal. You'd translate. Or find someone who could.

The same logic applies here.

Your skills are real. Your achievements are real. Your value is real.

But if the bouncer can't read your language, you're not getting in the club. And sitting outside insisting the bouncer *should* understand you doesn't change anything—it just means you're still standing in the cold while others are inside.

# Enter the Cyborg Career Manager

So what's the solution?

**Stop treating your career like it's 2010.**

The future belongs to what I call the ""Cyborg Career Manager""—human ambition directed by machine intelligence. Not replacing your humanity, but amplifying it through strategic use of the same tools that are currently keeping you out.

**This is where the FitScore360 philosophy comes in.**

# The Great Disconnect

We are currently living through that ""Deep Freeze"" in the labor market I mentioned. For the first time, we're seeing an AI arms race where candidates and recruiters are locked in a cycle of tech-driven one-upmanship.

Many believe that Idealism should win—that a great professional's value should be self-evident. But the Reality is that hiring has become structural. AI agents are no longer just tools; they are digital employees embedded across the entire hiring funnel, parsing and ranking resumes at a scale no human can match.

# Our Core Thesis: Adaptation is Not a Sellout

There is a fundamental difference between ""gaming"" a system and ""translating"" for it.

**The Algorithm's Bias:** Modern AI handles speed and signal detection, but they are ""drowning in noise."" They prioritize specific data points like headline keywords and skills-based markers over traditional pedigree.

**The Candidate's Burden:** If you refuse to adapt your information to the algorithm, you aren't being ""principled""—you are being silenced by a machine that cannot hear you.

# The New Paradigm of Career Management

We believe the future belongs to the ""Cyborg Career Manager""—human ambition directed by machine intelligence.

1. **Strategy over Stagnation:** In a low-hire environment, being ""good"" is invisible. Being ""optimized"" is the only way to reach the human-in-the-loop.
2. **Authenticity through Precision:** FitScore360 doesn't invent skills; we use the ""Ferraris of AI"" to extract the truth of your achievements and map them to the real-time ""Market DNA"" of what employers want right now.
3. **Upskilling as a Strategic Imperative:** AI is not just a tool; it is a structural change. Those who combine technical AI fluency with creative human capabilities will be the most valuable professionals of 2026.

# Strategy vs. Principles: The Final Word

To the skeptics who say adapting to an algorithm is absurd: **We agree.**

It *is* absurd that a machine stands between you and your next great opportunity.

It's absurd that years of dedication, growth, and expertise can be filtered out because your LinkedIn headline doesn't contain the right three-word phrase.

It's absurd that the ""bouncer"" has more power than the person who actually needs to hire you.

**But here's what's more absurd:** Letting your principles keep you unemployed while you wait for the system to change.

The human-in-the-loop—the hiring manager, the recruiter, the person who would actually value your contributions—they're in there. Behind the velvet rope. Waiting to meet qualified candidates.

But they'll never meet you if the algorithm doesn't let you through.

**FitScore360 is the strategic bridge.** Not a way to fake who you are, but a way to ensure your authentic value actually makes it to the desk where it can be appreciated.

Because at the end of the day, the best outfit in the world doesn't matter if you never get past the door.

Full Cupping Notes

    This lot from Banko Gotiti sees jasmine flower aromatics in full bloom, with clean transparent sweetness, and tropical fruit accents. The sweetness is refined at City roast level, with pristine acidity level that illuminates the cup without being grabby or sharp. But it's the aromatic profile that lands this coffee on the top shelf, and recalls the perfumed aspects of some of our most prized Gesha coffees. The dry fragrance has a scent of fragrant fresh cut flowers, honey, and sweetened jasmine pearl tea. The wetted crust of our City roast was incredibly floral, and could be smelled from across the room! We noted fresh stargazer lilies, tropical fruit, pineapple candy, honeydew, and refined sweetness underneath. The floral aspects are what resonate in the brewed coffee, leaving a lasting perfumed impression in the aftertaste. The cup sweetness has an agave aspect, accented by notes of golden plum, and candy-like fruits of guava and mango. And what an incredible mouth aroma, marked by lovely floral aromatics of jasmine, gardenia, and rose water. Citrus acidity adds structure to the delicate cup flavors, without any aggressive sharpness, and has a refreshing lemonade aspect with all that sweetness underneath. We're going with City to City+ for the recommended roast range since that's where Banko Gotiti hits its aromatic peak.

You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant.** Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use **Miro**
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use **Landwait**
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use **Google Docs**
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Us**e Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.**

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**

One of the most puzzling enigmas of the UFO phenomenon is the huge variation of reported humanoids. Grays, Mantids, Tall Whites, Nordics, Human-looking ETs, Blue Beings, Dwarves…the list seems endless. Complicating this is the fact that cultures across the world have been reporting a wide variety of supernatural entities. Fairies, elves, gnomes, kobalds…little people of all kinds. The question is: could some of these little people be aliens? Or vice-versa, could some of the aliens be little people? There doesn’t appear to be any easy answer. But the fact remains, there are countless reports of these kinds, and it is still going on today! This video presents ten fascinating cases, reaching back a hundred years to the current day, and coming from across the planet, where people have encountered little people which might be interpreted in different ways, elf or alien!?

AN ELF IN BRANTE, FINLAND. In 1885, a mother of three was picking berries in the forest near her home in Brante, Finland when she saw a large circular object landed on a small hill. Standing next to it was an elf-like creature holding an axe. Terrified, the woman fled the area. She returned a short time later with some other people, but the object and the elf were gone. She kept the secret for many years, finally sharing it with her granddaughter.

THE LITTLE MAN OF MONGAUP VALLEY, NY. Ron Quinn was only ten years old in August of 1942 when he was on vacation with his family in Mongaup Valley, NY. One afternoon, he was inside the cottage when he heard someone tapping on the window. Going to investigate, he was amazed to see a small man only one foot tall with long hair, a dark gray beard and large eyes wearing a green hat, a gray shirt, trousers, and soft brown boots. Smiling, the little man motioned for Ron to come closer. Ron opened the window and reached out to touch the man.

MY MYSTERIOUS FRIEND. In 1945, Galen Sharp was only five years old when an elf appeared in his home in Lakewood, CO. The little man was the same height as Galen, with large eyes, a rounded nose, and a bald head. He wore a short jacket, dark square-cut pants and worn leather shoes. He playfully introduced himself to Galen and disappeared. Over the next year, the elf reappeared several times, always when Galen was alone, and would share special stories with him and perform playful antics to make Galen laugh. One time, two elves showed up. Galen told his parents who thought he had an active imagination. But Galen got proof that the little elves were solid and real.

AN ALIEN ELF IN SAN GABRIEL, CA. It was Christmas morning in 1957 when a seven-year-old boy from San Gabriel, CA woke up to see a four-foot-tall elfish figure looking into the house from the front porch. The witness was “frozen” in bed, but watched in awe. He wanted to jump up and investigate, but was unable to move. Then he heard a message from the creature, “It’s okay now, go to sleep.” Which he did. When morning arrived, the boy had little interest in his presents. He wanted to see the elf!

THE FAIRY ELF OF APPLEBY, TX. It was a cold October morning in 1976 when a lady exited her rural home in Appleby, TX to burn some trash. To her shock, a strange tall winged creature with black eyes, long white hair, and gray skin was sitting on the bench in her flower garden. It was making weird humming noises. Suddenly it blazed with a brilliant white light and heat, causing the witness to protect her eyes. As the light and heat faded, the entity was gone, leaving a strange burned spot on her bench.

The GNOME OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY, CO. One afternoon in 1986, a man was digging up a tree near his home in rural Walsenburg, CO. Looking at a Pinion tree about twenty feet away, he saw a tiny nine-inch-tall figure dressed in a one-piece, brown leather suit wearing a cone-shaped hat. Amazed, he watched the little man for about ten minutes, until a co-worker called out to the witness, scaring the little man away, who ran quick as a rabbit into the nearby brush.

A TINY DWARF IN ROCK CREEK CANYON, CO. It was 10:00 a.m. on Sep 6, 1989, when bow-hunter Juan Maestas was stalking a herd of elk and heard a twig snap to his left. Turning to look, he saw a three-foot-tall fat, ugly-looking dwarf creature with red hair, a wrinkled face and pink skin. The dwarf was clean-shaven and wore green overalls with suspenders and a floppy hat. The little man smiled at Juan and darted behind a tree. He ran to find the figure, but he was gone. Unknown to him, two weeks earlier, a family of five picnicking in the area saw the same or similar figure.

THE LITTLE MAN OF ROSWELL, NM. Early one summer morning in 1997, a lady exited her yard to drink a cup of coffee on her picnic table when she noticed a little man one-foot-tall standing nearby. He had bushy eyebrows and a beard, and wore a gray woolen shirt and pants, and brown boots. The little man walked in a wobbling gait disappearing into a Chinaberry tree and was gone.

AN ELF IN THE BLACK FOREST OF GERMANY. One day around dusk in Summer 2002, Harmut Schulze was taking a drive with two friends to their home in Mitteltal. Looking outside the window, he saw a small elf-like creature relaxing on a woodpile alongside the road. The elf was smoking a pipe watching the traffic go by. When the elf saw that Harmut could see him, he jumped up in happy surprise and began to run along with the car.

THE LITTLE MEN OF ROUGH RIVER STATE PARK, KY. On the afternoon of Jun 24, 2003, a man was canoeing along the river when he found a strange clay pot with tiny little handprints on it. Hearing high-pitched laughter, he looked up and saw two little men, each about ten inches in height, with pale skin, red hair, and blue eyes. They were shirtless but wore leather pants with suspenders and little pointed hats. Soon more appeared. The little men were working to pull a stump with ropes. There was a loud banging noise and all of them disappeared.

These encounters with little people of all kinds challenge what we think we know about Earth, the extraterrestrial presence on our planet, and intelligent life in this universe. Perhaps some of the little creatures that people report are not aliens at all, but are elves, fairies, gnomes, and dwarves.

My routine looks like this: •	Wake up at 4:50am •	Leave at 5:00am •	Start work at 6:30am (construction industry, on my feet/walking most of the day) •	Home around 6:00pm •	Try to work on a side hustle from 7:30pm to 11:00pm

Reality is I’m falling asleep around 9:30pm most nights.

Diet is solid — mostly whole foods, butcher meat, high protein, no processed junk. I only drink water. No energy drinks. No coffee habit.

I’m not looking for a caffeine buzz or stimmed-out feeling. I want: •	Long-lasting energy •	Reduced fatigue (mental + physical) •	Better evening productivity •	No teeth staining drinks •	No seed oils / fillers / artificial crap

I’ve looked at magnesium blends, AG1 type products, L-tyrosine, rhodiola etc but I’m not sure what actually moves the needle for sustained energy vs placebo.

Important: I don’t want something that trashes sleep long term. I just need more capacity to push through the evening without crashing.

If you were in my position, what would you prioritise?

Bloodwork? Specific supplements? Adaptogens? Something else entirely?

You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant.** Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use **Miro**
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use [**Landwait.com**](http://landwait.com/)
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use **Google Docs**
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Us**e Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.**

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**

After this comes the pricing topic. If you want me to cover that in the next post, please let me know.",1,1770991753.0,nocode,0,1.0,False

Barun is sitting there in a plain grey hoodie, looking like he just rolled out of bed but somehow still looks like a cinematic shot.





**EXT. VANITY VAN - NIGHT**

Sidharth is pacing the small floor of the van while Barun calmly sips black coffee, watching him with an amused, steady gaze.

**SIDHARTH** Yaar, Barun... tune dekha na kya hua? Parineeti literally destroyed me live. Viral ho gaya hoon main as the 'Anxious Puppy.' I need to change the vibe, man. I need that... that 'Sobti Stare.'

**BARUN** (Looking at him blankly) Sidharth, it’s 9 PM. Tu dhang se baith pehle. What even is a 'Sobti Stare'? Main bas thaka hua hota hoon, bro.

**SIDHARTH** Nahi, listen! Sab kehte hain tu 'mysterious' hai, 'clean' hai, 'unreachable' hai. Even Karan Johar is obsessed with your 'intensity.' Mujhe bhi wahi seekhna hai. How do you stay so chill when everyone wants a piece of you?

**BARUN** (Setting the cup down, leaning back) Simple hai. Stop over-explaining. Industry mein sab ki aadat hai har cheez ka justification dene ki. If you don’t show up, you don’t have to tell them why. Just don’t show up.

**SIDHARTH** (Taking notes on his phone) 'Don’t show up.' Okay. Par agar koi ro raha ho? Like, if a co-star starts crying in front of me again?

**BARUN** (With a straight face) Toh rone de. If it’s real, they need space. If it’s fake, they want a reaction. Don’t give them either. Bas ek baar look de, and walk away. Silent treatment is the best PR, Sid.

**SIDHARTH** (Trying to mimic Barun’s intense, brooding look) Accha, look at me. Is this mysterious?

Sidharth narrows his eyes and tries to look deep and soulful. He looks more like he’s trying to read a distant menu without his glasses.

**BARUN** (Bursts out laughing) Nahi, nahi! Tu toh aise lag raha hai jaise tujhe acidity ho gayi hai. Relax your eyebrows, man. Mystery comes from *actually* not caring, not from pretending to think about something deep.

**SIDHARTH** (Laughing) Mushkil hai, yaar! My face just wants to be nice. I’m a nice guy!

**BARUN** (Smiling warmly) And that’s fine. But if you want to prank Parineeti back? Next time she talks, just look at her for ten seconds. Don't blink. Don't say a word. Just tilt your head slightly.

**SIDHARTH** (Practicing the head tilt) Aur phir?

**BARUN** Phir uth ke chala ja. No 'sorry,' no 'dinner on me.' Jab woh call karegi, pick up after the tenth ring and just say, ""Abhi nahi,"" and hang up. She’ll go crazy wondering what she did wrong.

**SIDHARTH** (Grinning) Damn. Tu sach mein khatarnak hai, Barun. This is 'Clean but Lethal.'

**BARUN** (Getting up to leave) It’s not lethal, it’s just peace of mind. Anyway, wife is waiting. Good luck with the 'mystery,' Bond.

Barun claps Sid on the shoulder and walks out into the night without looking back. Sidharth stands in front of the mirror, practicing the ""Barun Head Tilt"" for five minutes before he accidentally smiles at himself.

That weird tension in the air. The lingering looks. The way someone lights up when you walk into the room. But you second-guess everything because you don't want to look like an idiot who misread the signals. I get it. After diving deep into body language research, evolutionary psychology studies, and even some wild insights from behavioral experts like Vanessa Van Edwards and Matthew Hussey's podcasts, I realized most of us are walking around completely blind to these cues. We're literally programmed to notice attraction signals, but modern anxiety and overthinking have messed with our instincts. So here's what actually happens when someone's into you, backed by science and real human behavior.

## 1. Their Body Literally Turns Toward You

When someone's attracted, their entire body becomes a compass pointing at you. Feet, torso, shoulders. All aimed in your direction. This isn't some magical thing, it's biology. Research from nonverbal communication studies shows that we unconsciously orient ourselves toward things we value or desire.

If you're talking in a group and their feet are pointed at you (not toward the exit or someone else), that's your first clue. Their body is screaming ""I want to be closer to you"" even if their mouth is talking about the weather.

## 2. The Eyes Don't Lie (Especially the Pupils)

Eye contact is obvious, right? Wrong. There's eye contact, and then there's that kind of eye contact. When someone's attracted to you, they hold your gaze a beat longer than normal. But here's the kicker, their pupils dilate. You can't fake that. It's an automatic response controlled by the autonomic nervous system.

A study published in Psychological Science found that pupil dilation is directly linked to emotional arousal and attraction. So if you catch someone's eyes looking bigger than usual when they're talking to you, boom. That's biology doing its thing.

Also, watch for the triangle gaze. Their eyes move from your eyes to your mouth and back. That's not accidental. That's their brain imagining what it would be like to kiss you.

## 3. They Mirror Your Movements

Mirroring is one of those sneaky signs that flies completely under the radar. When someone's attracted, they subconsciously copy your body language. You lean in, they lean in. You cross your legs, they cross theirs. You pick up your drink, guess what? They're reaching for theirs too.

This comes from research on rapport building and connection. Mirroring creates a sense of ""we're alike"" and builds intimacy without anyone saying a word. Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in her work on charisma and connection, how mirroring is one of the most powerful nonverbal cues of attraction.

## 4. They Find Excuses to Touch You

Touch is huge. But we're not talking about obvious, over the top contact. It's the light brush on your arm when they're making a point. The ""accidental"" bump when you're walking. The playful shove when you make a joke.

According to touch research in social psychology, even brief, casual touch increases feelings of connection and attraction. If someone keeps finding reasons to be in your physical space or makes light contact, their brain is testing the waters. They want to see how you respond to closeness.

## 5. They Remember Weird, Random Details About You

Someone who's attracted to you pays attention. Like, creepy levels of attention (but in a good way). They remember that offhand comment you made three weeks ago about hating cilantro. They ask about your dog by name. They bring up something you mentioned in passing like it's important.

Why? Because to them, you are important. Our brains prioritize information about people we care about or are attracted to. It's called selective attention. If they're cataloging the small stuff, it means you're taking up real estate in their mind.

## 6. Their Voice Changes When They Talk to You

This one's wild but real. Research shows that people alter their vocal tone when speaking to someone they're attracted to. Women's voices often get slightly higher and more melodic. Men's voices can drop lower, becoming more resonant.

It's not a conscious thing. It's an evolutionary tactic to sound more appealing. A study from the Journal of Nonverbal Behavior found that vocal modulation is a key indicator of romantic interest. So if someone sounds different around you compared to how they talk to others, take note.

## 7. They Laugh at Everything You Say (Even Your Bad Jokes)

Laughter is a social bonding tool, and when someone's into you, they're going to laugh at your jokes even when they're not that funny. I'm talking full on giggling at your dumb puns.

This ties into something called ""humor affiliation."" When we're attracted to someone, we want to signal that we enjoy their company and find them entertaining. Laughter creates positive associations and releases feel good chemicals like dopamine and endorphins. If they're laughing more around you than seems normal, they're basically telling their brain, ""I like this person.""

## 8. They Get Nervous or Fidgety Around You

Attraction isn't always smooth. Sometimes it makes people awkward as hell. If someone fidgets with their hair, adjusts their clothes, or seems a little jittery when you're around, that's nervous energy. It means they care what you think about them.

The book The Like Switch by Jack Schafer (former FBI agent) dives into how nervousness and self grooming behaviors are attraction indicators. People primp and fidget because they want to look good for you. It's your brain's way of saying, ""Don't screw this up.""

If you want to go deeper into understanding these patterns and build real social confidence, there's an app called BeFreed that pulls insights from relationship psychology books, dating expert interviews, and behavioral research to create personalized audio learning. 

It generates custom podcasts based on goals like ""become more magnetic in dating"" or ""read social cues better as an introvert."" You control the depth, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples. The voice options are surprisingly addictive too, including a smoky, conversational tone that makes complex psychology feel like chatting with a smart friend. It's built by Columbia grads and backed by a growing library of dating coaches, communication experts, and peer-reviewed studies.

## 9. They Go Out of Their Way to Be Near You

This one's pretty straightforward but easy to miss. If someone consistently shows up where you are (even when it's not convenient), that's intentional. They take the long route to pass your desk. They happen to be at the same coffee shop. They volunteer for projects you're on.

Proximity is everything in attraction. We're more likely to develop feelings for people we see regularly (it's called the mere exposure effect). If they're engineering situations to be around you, it's because being near you matters to them.

## 10. They Ask Personal Questions and Actually Listen

When someone's attracted, they want to know you. Not just surface level chitchat, but real stuff. They ask about your dreams, your past, your weird hobbies. And here's the key, they actually listen. They follow up on things you told them before. They engage deeply with your answers.

This comes back to investment. People invest time and emotional energy into people they care about. If they're treating conversations with you like they're collecting puzzle pieces to understand who you are, that's attraction.

Here's the thing. Biology, psychology, and evolutionary wiring all play massive roles in how attraction works. These signs aren't guarantees, humans are messy and unpredictable. But if you're seeing multiple signals from this list, chances are high that person feels something.

The real challenge isn't spotting the signs. It's trusting yourself enough to believe them. Stop overthinking. Start noticing. And maybe, just maybe, take the leap and see what happens.",1,1770991650.0,MenInModernDating,0,1.0,False

1r3q25q,https://www.reddit.com/r/B2BSaaS/comments/1r3q25q/the_idea_validation_framework/,the idea validation framework,"I see tons of posts about ""idea validation"" and ""validate my idea."" You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant.** Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use **Miro**
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use [**Landwait.com**](http://landwait.com/)
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use **Google Docs**
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Us**e Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.**

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**

After this comes the pricing topic. If you want me to cover that in the next post, please let me know.",1,1770991590.0,B2BSaaS,0,1.0,False

Not just any underwear, her dad’s. Her dad has no idea about this addiction. Will she get the help she needs or will this addiction ruin her relationship with her dad?

Marsha is addicted to Kangaroos. Yes kangaroos 🦘.

She treats them like her children. They are her whole life. Will she be able to bounce back?

Angela is addicted to coffee like most people but the amount she consumes is more than anyone. The FDA recommends under 400mg of caffeine per day.she has around 5000 mg of caffeine per day. this addiction has gotten in the way of her sleeping and eating. Her children are worried for her health. Will she be able to kick this habit or is it too latte?

I was disturbed a lot watching this episode with Anissa. I was shocked. At first, I was thinking oh this is some sort of incest stuff in her father knows about it but to find out he had no idea about her doing this behind his back and his reaction, I was like oh this is deeper than what I thought initially. i’m glad she saw a therapist and is getting help but truly this was such an odd one for me. I really had to do double takes the whole time.

someone posted on this subreddit already about Angela and her coffee addiction. I also thought the entire time I was watching it that she must have a prior history with substances and replaced that addiction with another, coffee. I just think there’s no way a human can possibly have that much caffeine if they weren’t used to any sort of uppers before.

Cooked endless meals and drove people around for the last two days! Departures! Arrivals! 

Unimaginable dishes and clean ups with a sick cat and a very clingy teenage brother who insists on doing stuff with me!

A very loud house (cricket World Cup!). Endless smokes. Endless tea. The doorbell constantly ringing! Endless food deliveries! Endless pots of kahwa! With my cat in my lap or in my arms lol! 

Bike rides!

More guests!

More food!

More dishes!

More tea!

A random hug from my dad saying “u did well , djinnie!” And instantly I feel so happy!

A look from my partner- no words needed and we both just head out to walk together in absolute beautiful breeze on the beach!

A kind pat on my head by my nan!

A hug from my brother and a kiss on the cheek from my mum!

1r3q19o,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1r3q19o/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

1r3q0n4,https://i.redd.it/74zuazm3q9jg1.png,Leaked: Barun Sobti’s advice to Sidharth Malhotra on how to handle Parineeti Chopra’s trolling - The ‘Clean Guy’ Crisis: Part 3,"**Setting:** A quiet, dimly lit vanity van parked on the outskirts of Mumbai. **Sidharth Malhotra** has invited **Barun Sobti** over for ""coffee,"" but he has a secret agenda. Barun is sitting there in a plain grey hoodie, looking like he just rolled out of bed but somehow still looks like a cinematic shot.



**EXT. VANITY VAN - NIGHT**

Sidharth is pacing the small floor of the van while Barun calmly sips black coffee, watching him with an amused, steady gaze.

**SIDHARTH** Yaar, Barun... tune dekha na kya hua? Parineeti literally destroyed me live. Viral ho gaya hoon main as the 'Anxious Puppy.' I need to change the vibe, man. I need that... that 'Sobti Stare.'

**BARUN** (Looking at him blankly) Sidharth, it’s 9 PM. Tu dhang se baith pehle. What even is a 'Sobti Stare'? Main bas thaka hua hota hoon, bro.

**SIDHARTH** Nahi, listen! Sab kehte hain tu 'mysterious' hai, 'clean' hai, 'unreachable' hai. Even Karan Johar is obsessed with your 'intensity.' Mujhe bhi wahi seekhna hai. How do you stay so chill when everyone wants a piece of you?

**BARUN** (Setting the cup down, leaning back) Simple hai. Stop over-explaining. Industry mein sab ki aadat hai har cheez ka justification dene ki. If you don’t show up, you don’t have to tell them why. Just don’t show up.

**SIDHARTH** (Taking notes on his phone) 'Don’t show up.' Okay. Par agar koi ro raha ho? Like, if a co-star starts crying in front of me again?

**BARUN** (With a straight face) Toh rone de. If it’s real, they need space. If it’s fake, they want a reaction. Don’t give them either. Bas ek baar look de, and walk away. Silent treatment is the best PR, Sid.

**SIDHARTH** (Trying to mimic Barun’s intense, brooding look) Accha, look at me. Is this mysterious?

Sidharth narrows his eyes and tries to look deep and soulful. He looks more like he’s trying to read a distant menu without his glasses.

**BARUN** (Bursts out laughing) Nahi, nahi! Tu toh aise lag raha hai jaise tujhe acidity ho gayi hai. Relax your eyebrows, man. Mystery comes from *actually* not caring, not from pretending to think about something deep.

**SIDHARTH** (Laughing) Mushkil hai, yaar! My face just wants to be nice. I’m a nice guy!

**BARUN** (Smiling warmly) And that’s fine. But if you want to prank Parineeti back? Next time she talks, just look at her for ten seconds. Don't blink. Don't say a word. Just tilt your head slightly.

**SIDHARTH** (Practicing the head tilt) Aur phir?

**BARUN** Phir uth ke chala ja. No 'sorry,' no 'dinner on me.' Jab woh call karegi, pick up after the tenth ring and just say, ""Abhi nahi,"" and hang up. She’ll go crazy wondering what she did wrong.

**SIDHARTH** (Grinning) Damn. Tu sach mein khatarnak hai, Barun. This is 'Clean but Lethal.'

**BARUN** (Getting up to leave) It’s not lethal, it’s just peace of mind. Anyway, wife is waiting. Good luck with the 'mystery,' Bond.

Barun claps Sid on the shoulder and walks out into the night without looking back. Sidharth stands in front of the mirror, practicing the ""Barun Head Tilt"" for five minutes before he accidentally smiles at himself.

Somewhere between responsibilities, plans, and learning how to stand on my own, I realized that success feels a little quieter when you don’t have someone to share it with.

I guess I’m looking for a genuine connection. Someone who makes ordinary days feel softer. Someone I can be fully myself with — no pretending, no pressure to always be impressive. Just two people choosing each other’s company because it feels right.

I know life is already heavy sometimes. Maybe we can make it lighter for each other.

**About me:**

* 22, recent graduate, currently focused on building stability and figuring out the next chapter of life
* Introverted at first, but warm, playful, and talkative once I feel safe around someone
* Kind, empathetic, honest, and loyal — I value consistency more than grand gestures
* The listener type. I remember small details and check in when it matters
* Homebody energy, but I enjoy going out occasionally when the company feels right
* Emotionally aware and believes in communicating instead of guessing games
* Love languages: physical touch, quality time, and acts of service
* Supportive by nature — I like encouraging people to grow without making them feel pressured
* Mental health matters to me; I appreciate emotional maturity and self-awareness
* Physically: average to slightly chubby build, soft-looking rather than athletic. I’m not the gym-type but I take care of myself. Average height which is 5 flat. Often described as having an intimidating aura
* The type who enjoys slow moments: late-night talks, shared playlists, or just being together doing separate things

**Interests:**

* Music that feels nostalgic or comforting
* Movies or series after long days
* Deep conversations about life, dreams, and random thoughts at 2AM
* Memes and humor to balance serious conversations
* Coffee runs, quiet places, and walks where conversations just flow naturally
* Occasionally gaming (cozy games) or just staying in to recharge

**About you:**

* 24–32, single, emotionally available, and genuinely interested in building something meaningful
* Kind and gentle, especially during disagreements
* Honest and communicative — someone who says what they feel instead of disappearing or playing games
* Emotionally aware and understands that both people are still growing
* Someone affectionate in small ways: thoughtful messages, checking in, enjoying closeness
* Can hold conversations and share stories — someone curious about people and life
* Respects boundaries and believes effort should go both ways
* Authentic. Comfortable being imperfect and allowing others to be imperfect too
* No vices

**Physical preferences (just being honest, not strict requirements):**

* I’m generally attracted tall guys
* Slim to muscular build
* Nice smile and expressive eyes tend to get my attention more than anything else
* Bonus if you enjoy simple dates over loud party scenes

We don’t have to rush anything. Maybe we start with conversations, sharing stories, or keeping each other company after long days. And if it slowly turns into something deeper, then maybe we’ll know — sometimes all it takes is getting it right just one time.

# Chapter 1 Lock Her Up

Yvonne Lynch's heels clicked on the marble floor as she stepped into the Greenfield Estate foyer.

The maids immediately bowed their heads. ""Mrs. Shaw.""

Yvonne nodded, then spotted a pair of custom leather shoes by the door. Her voice lifted with excitement. ""Is Jackson home?""

""Yeah,"" one maid answered. ""Mr. Shaw got back a little after nine. He's in the study.""

Jackson Shaw traveled abroad for business at least twice a month. Yvonne never used to pay much attention to his comings and goings, but today was different.

She clutched the ultrasound report in her handbag, a smile spreading across her face. She couldn't wait to share the news with him.

She quickly changed her shoes and hurried upstairs. But as her fingers brushed the papers in her bag, she remembered the doctor's advice and forced herself to slow down.

The door to the study on the second floor was ajar, and faint voices of conversation drifted out.

Just as Yvonne was about to push the door open, Jackson's icy, resolute voice cut through the air.

""Yvonne is nothing more than a pawn to get back at Richard. Fall in love with my enemy's daughter? Give me a break,"" he sneered.

On the other end of the line, Andrew Foster roared, ""You bastard! Do you have a conscience? You even lied to me? If this blows up, I'm screwed.""

'I'm dead. If Jennifer finds out, she'll kill me,' Andrew thought, panic rising in his chest.

Jackson took a slow drag from his cigarette. The smoke blurred the coldness in his eyes, a stark contrast to his usual calm.

""Putting on an act means going all the way. Otherwise, where's the pleasure of revenge?"" he said

Outside the study, Yvonne gripped the ultrasound report so tightly she nearly tore it apart.

A chill shot through her, freezing her in place. Uncontrollably, she started trembling.

The excitement and hope in her eyes vanished, replaced by bitter sarcasm.

Andrew's voice exploded through the phone, even angrier than before. ""You're fucking ruthless! What did Yvonne ever do to you? Her father made the mistake.""

Jackson's tone was ice-cold. ""Relax, I haven't laid a finger on her. We're both using each other. Besides, she should answer for her father's mistakes.""

""You're a real piece of work. We're done being friends,"" Andrew roared, his voice so loud it almost blew out the speaker.

Just then, the housekeeper Luna's voice came from behind Yvonne. ""Mrs. Shaw, why are you standing here? Isn't Mr. Shaw in the study?""

She was holding Jackson's coffee, puzzled to see Yvonne frozen in the doorway.

Inside the study, Jackson casually ended the call and strode out.

He raised an eyebrow when his eyes met Yvonne's frosty expression, his tone casual. ""Heard everything, huh?""

Yvonne clenched the ultrasound report so tightly her knuckles turned white.

The joy she had been clinging to shattered like glass, and all that remained was a biting bitterness.

She forced a smile, her voice trembling yet sharp. ""Yeah, I heard. Pity I missed the whole show. You've put on quite the performance, Mr. Shaw. Doesn't it ever get tiring?""

Jackson's gaze hardened, a chill settling over his expression. ""If you want someone to blame, blame your father.""

Yvonne let out a bitter laugh. She only blamed herself for being so foolish, for ever thinking good things could come her way, for believing in his empty affection.

""Let's get a divorce,"" she said, holding his gaze with unwavering resolve. ""You picked the wrong target. If you wanted revenge, you should've married Natalie, his illegitimate daughter.""

Jackson nodded, his voice flat. ""Fine. Give your terms to my lawyer tomorrow. Just keep them realistic.""

The moment he finished speaking, Yvonne whirled around and slapped him hard across the face.

""Consider this what you owe me,"" she said, the ultrasound report slipping from her grasp and fluttering to the floor.

Jackson's head jerked to the side, his cheek burning. His eyes, however, were locked on the fallen paper.

He bent down and picked it up. The words ""early pregnancy"" leaped out at him, and his mind went blank.

Yvonne snatched the report back, her gaze cold and venomous. ""Don't worry. This won't ever be your problem. It'll never be born.""

With that, she turned and walked away, without a single glance behind her.

Jackson stared at her figure retreating into the distance. For a long moment, he couldn't say a word.

He turned to Luna, his voice cold and sharp. ""Do not let her leave the estate. And make sure she doesn't do anything to harm the pregnancy.""

Luna was stunned. ' Weren't they just talking about divorce? Why did Mr. Shaw's attitude change in the blink of an eye?'

But when she met the deadly chill in Jackson's eyes, she hurriedly replied, ""Yes, Mr. Shaw.""

""If she gets out, you'll all regret it,"" Jackson warned, his tone icy.

Luna nodded urgently, watching as he turned and strode back into the study.

\*\*\*\*\*

Jackson dropped into his chair, fingers flying over his phone: \[Cut all signals at the estate. Now.\]

He crushed the cigarette box in his grip, a lit cigarette smoldering between his fingers as ash drifted to the floor.

He stared into the swirling smoke, fixated on one thought. 'When did Yvonne get pregnant? We've been using protection the whole time.'

Suddenly, a hazy memory broke through. The last time he returned from Yariland, Yvonne had been unusually tender. That night, he'd been in a rush and forgotten protection. Afterward, he never reminded her to take her pills.

He let out a dry laugh. 'She sure is fertile. One shot, and she got pregnant.'

Jackson took a long drag, the smoke burning his throat, but the turmoil inside him only churned harder.

Just as the cigarette burned down to the filter, the study door flew open.

Yvonne stormed in, her eyes blazing with fury. ""What is this, Jackson? Locking me up like some prisoner?""

She'd packed a simple bag and marched toward the front door, only to be stopped. When she tried to call for help, her phone had no signal at all.

Jackson looked up casually, his tone calm. ""Have the baby. The child will be a Shaw, and I'll give you thirty million.""

Yvonne laughed coldly, her eyes sharp with contempt. ""Not a chance.""

She knew perfectly well that Jackson wanted this child only because of Maria, not because he loved the baby.

Maria had been pestering him for a great-grandchild for ages, but he always brushed her off, saying he was still young.

It wasn't until last month, when Maria fell seriously ill, that Jackson started taking it seriously. He wanted to fulfill her wish while she was still here.

""You're having this baby,"" Jackson said, rising to his feet and closing in on her step by step.

""I'll give you 30 million. Easy money, right?"" he added.

""I may not be rich, but I won't sell my child,"" Yvonne shot back, her voice edged with anger. ""If you want a baby, plenty of women would jump at the chance. But count me out.""

Jackson's expression hardened, his tone steel. ""If you refuse, you're not going anywhere.""

With that, he dialed the internal line.

Soon, Luna arrived with two sturdy maids, who seized Yvonne and began pulling her away.

Yvonne fought with everything she had, but she was no match for their strength.

""This is illegal detention. You'll go to jail for this,"" she yelled, her voice raw with fury. ""You'll pay for this, you bastard!""

Jackson didn't even flinch, just shot Luna a cold look. ""Keep a close eye on her and the baby. Clear anything dangerous from her room.""

Luna caught the desperation in Yvonne's eyes and felt a pang of guilt. She hesitated, then spoke softly, ""Mr. Shaw, are you really going to keep Mrs. Shaw locked up like this?""

Jackson's eyes darkened, his voice freezing the air. ""Since when do I answer to you?""

Luna quickly lowered her head. ""No, of course not.""

""Get a nutritionist and a doctor here. And keep a close eye on her condition,"" Jackson added.

""Yes, Mr. Shaw,"" Luna replied.

Suddenly, it hit Jackson, and he said, ""If Jennifer asks, tell her Yvonne went abroad on vacation. No return date set.""

Luna's heart skipped a beat, but she managed a nod. ""Understood.""

The study fell silent. Jackson walked to the window, absently rubbing the cigarette pack between his fingers, his gaze unreadable.

1r3pr5v,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1r3pr5v,Ascaso Steel duo plus vs Lelit Mara X V2 [3000$],"Hi everyone,

I’m currently trying to decide on my next espresso machine and I’ve narrowed it down to two options: the Ascaso Steel Duo Plus and the Lelit Mara X.

Space is definitely a real constraint for me, which is why it came down to these two machines in the first place. I don’t really have the room for a full-sized dual boiler or HX machine, otherwise I might be looking more seriously in that direction as well.

Budget-wise, this is more of a passion purchase. My girlfriend and I both love coffee and this is very much a hobby investment for us. Realistically, I don’t want to go past $4,000, but anything under that isn’t really the deciding factor. If one machine is more expensive, that just means saving up a month longer. So price isn’t the main issue. Getting the right machine is.

If I’m honest, my heart leans strongly toward the Lelit. I really like the brand, and I absolutely love the look of an E61 group. The white Mara X especially looks amazing. Aesthetically, it’s exactly what I picture when I think of a home espresso setup.

But I’m trying to be rational.

From a practicality standpoint, the Ascaso seems to have a few advantages. The heat-up time is a big one. I also understand the argument that it’s an advantage not to be constantly reheating the same boiler water. I also really like the customizable pre-infusion, the built-in shot timer, and the overall modern control features on the Ascaso. Those are definite positives for me. The Steel Duo Plus looks great too, just less classic and more modern compared to the Mara X.

That said, when I hear the Ascaso in YouTube videos, especially during steaming, the sound honestly seems a bit unpleasant. Hard to judge from videos, but it stands out to me.

Usage-wise:

	•	99% of the time it’s just my girlfriend and me.

	•	We will mostly make milk-based drinks. We love cappuccinos.

	•	Typically two cappuccinos back-to-back, maybe once or twice a day.

	•	We don’t host big groups often where we need to crank out 6 to 8 drinks in a row.

	•	But we do want to explore espresso more deeply. We want to experiment with different beans, play with espresso profiles, and really grow into the hobby.

•	We clearly like a white machine, why for example a profitec move isn’t a contender even tho we like the features

So I’d especially love to hear from:

	•	People who owned a Mara X and switched to the Steel Duo or vice versa.

	•	People who went from thermoblock machines like the Ascaso to traditional dual boiler or HX machines and either regretted it or loved it.

	•	Anyone who bought an Ascaso and later wished they had gone with a traditional dual boiler or HX setup.

	•	Or the opposite: people who compared dual boiler or HX machines and now really celebrate the advantages of the Steel Duo.

Basically: am I romanticizing the E61 too much? Or is the Steel Duo the smarter long-term move for my use case?

Would really appreciate real-world experiences.

I'm 24, first job out of college, and after all my monthly expenses I had ₹3000 set aside for Valentine's Day. My girlfriend likes Valentine's and I like making her happy, so I wanted to figure out how to make it special without going broke.

Here's what I'm not doing: buying ₹200 roses, teddy bears, or going to expensive restaurants and ordering the cheapest items. That all felt wrong.

Instead here's my plan: Morning: I'm setting up breakfast at her place before she wakes up. Fresh croissants from a French bakery, strawberries, orange juice, and coffee (₹400). Afternoon: Taking her to a pottery class she's been wanting to try. It's ₹800 for two hours and we both get to keep what we make, so it's like a gift we created together. Evening - Dinner at Hakuna Matata. Found a table on District app when phone booking was done they have really nice section and offers for valentine’s day honestly gamechanger. Nice rooftop vibe, decent prices, should stay under ₹1400 for both of us, they have really nice section and offers for valentine’s day. Gift - Made a 365 days jar with notes she can read every day for a year. Different compliments, memories, inside jokes, future plans. Cost ₹250 in materials plus 4 hours of my time. Also getting her favorite Ferrero Rocher chocolate.

Total comes to exactly ₹3000. I'm actually kind of proud I made this work without it feeling cheap. The pottery class and the notes jar feel way more meaningful than expensive dinner and generic gifts anyway.

Question though - should I tell her there was a budget or just let her enjoy the day? I'm proud I planned well within constraints but also don't want it to seem like I'm making excuses.

1r3pmoh,https://v.redd.it/fhjhsi6vn9jg1,Moksha Is Not Product Of Effort/Karma And Understanding/Jnana | Jñāna–Karma–Samucchaya?,"source: [Lectures](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqS0rzdAhIc&list=PLyTNxeJ5o0Bm0kM3S45TNcCPJxjBIjNuc&index=1) on the text ""Daśaślokī"" of Adi Shankaracharya in English

Sri Swami Tattvavidananda Saraswati explores the nature of attaining spiritual freedom (Moksha) and refutes the common idea that it is a result of hard work or a mixture of action and knowledge.

### **The False Mentality of ""How to Get It""**

The speaker highlights that when people ask ""how"" to get Moksha, they have already mistakenly concluded that it is a product of effort. This mindset treats liberation like a consumer product—such as an iPhone—implying there is a specific method, technique, or process that takes time to complete. He argues that any process involving time (e.g., studying for years to become free in the future) is a movement in time and not true liberation.

### **Effort vs. Looking**

The speaker clarifies the difference between effort (Karma) and understanding (Jnana):

* **Karma (Effort):** Moksha is not something to be ""gotten"" through physical or mental labor.
* **Looking (Understanding):** Understanding does not require effort; it requires ""looking."" He uses the example of knowing what a book is—you don't make an effort to know it; you simply look into it.

### **Refuting the Synthesis (Jñāna-Karma-Samucchaya)**

The video addresses the common attempt to compromise by combining effort and understanding, known as *Jñāna-Karma-Samucchaya* or synthesis.

* The speaker explains that Adi Shankara vehemently refuted this idea because he understood the human mind's tendency to want to ""do something"" to achieve a result.
* Understanding is compared to ""black coffee""—pure and unmixed with ""milk or sugar"" (karma or rituals). It is an effortless state that does not mix with anything else.

### **The Analogy of Sleep**

To illustrate the nature of effortless understanding, the speaker uses the example of sleep:

* An insomniac puts in immense effort to fall asleep but fails precisely because of that effort.
* To sleep, one must give up all effort and surrender. Similarly, Moksha comes through effortless understanding, not through finishing dozens of texts or performing rituals.

### **Conclusion: Understanding vs. Knowledge Systems**

The speaker concludes by defining Moksha as freedom from unhappiness and insecurity, which is attained through *Jñāna* (understanding). He warns against turning this into a ""knowledge system"" or a collection of information, emphasizing that it is a direct, effortless realization rather than an academic achievement.

1r3pkrz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenWithDiscipline/comments/1r3pkrz/how_to_walk_into_any_room_like_you_own_the_place/,How to Walk Into Any Room Like You OWN The Place: Science-Based Psychology That Actually Works,"I used to panic before walking into parties, networking events, literally anywhere new. Heart racing, palms sweating, that whole catastrophe. Then I spent way too much time researching this exact thing, books, psychology podcasts, body language studies, the whole nine yards, because honestly I was tired of feeling like an imposter everywhere I went.

Here's what actually works. Not the generic ""just be confident"" BS everyone parrots.

1. Fix your body before your brain catches up

Your physiology literally controls your psychology. Sounds dramatic but it's backed by solid research. Amy Cuddy's work at Harvard (yeah the TED talk lady) proved that holding power poses for 2 minutes increases testosterone and decreases cortisol. Translation: you feel more dominant and less anxious.

Before entering any room, find a bathroom or quiet corner. Stand tall, shoulders back, hands on hips or arms stretched overhead like you just won something. Do this for 90 seconds minimum. Your brain will follow your body's lead. It's weirdly effective.

Also, slow everything down. Walk slower than you think you should. Talk slower. Fast movements scream nervousness. Confident people don't rush because they're not trying to escape discomfort. Practice this in low stakes situations first, like walking to grab coffee.

2. Master the first 7 seconds

People form impressions insanely fast. Malcolm Gladwell breaks this down in [""Blink""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40102.Blink) (Pulitzer winner, millions of copies sold, legitimately changed how I see snap judgments). Your entrance sets the entire tone.

Here's the tactical breakdown: Pause briefly in the doorway. Not awkwardly long, just a beat. Scan the room calmly like you're assessing where you want to be, not desperately looking for someone you know. Make eye contact with a few people. Small smile. Then move with purpose toward wherever you're heading, drink table, a group, doesn't matter.

The pause is KEY. It signals you're comfortable being seen. People who belong don't skulk in trying to be invisible.

3. Assume rapport, don't beg for it

This one's huge. Most people enter spaces hoping someone will validate them, include them, make them feel welcome. Flip that script entirely.

Assume people are already glad you're there. Assume the conversation you're joining wants your input. Assume you have every right to exist in that space. Because you do.

Vanessa Van Edwards talks about this in [""Captivate""]() (Wall Street Journal bestseller, she runs a human behavior lab, this book is legitimately fascinating). She calls it ""assuming the sale"" in social situations. Don't ask permission with your energy. Just belong.

Practically: When approaching a group, don't hover anxiously at the edges. Step into the circle with your body angled toward them. Wait for a natural pause, then contribute. If someone's telling a story, react genuinely. You're not auditioning for acceptance, you're participating because that's what people do.

4. Try structured learning for deeper confidence work

If you want to go beyond quick tips and actually build lasting social confidence, [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is worth checking out. It's a personalized learning app that pulls from books like the ones mentioned here, expert talks, and psychology research to create custom audio content based on your specific goals.

Say you want to ""walk into rooms confidently as an introvert"" or ""build magnetic presence in professional settings."" Type that in, and it generates a structured learning plan with episodes you can listen to during your commute. You control the depth, anywhere from a 10-minute overview to a 40-minute deep dive with examples and context. Plus you can pick different voices, some people swear by the smoky, calm narrator for tough concepts.

What makes it useful is the adaptive learning plan. It tracks what resonates with you and evolves the content as you progress. There's also a virtual coach called Freedia you can chat with about your specific struggles, like ""I freeze when entering group conversations"" and it'll recommend relevant material or clarify concepts on the spot.

Built by folks from Columbia and Google, so the content quality is solid. It's basically designed to make self-improvement feel less like a chore and more like something you actually want to come back to.

5. Have a purpose beyond being liked

People who seem like they belong aren't obsessing over belonging. They're focused on something else: having interesting conversations, learning something new, finding potential collaborators, whatever.

Give yourself a mission that's bigger than ""don't be awkward and hopefully someone talks to me."" Decide you're going to have three genuine conversations. Or learn one surprising thing. Or make one person laugh.

Robert Greene explores this in [""The Laws of Human Nature""](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39330937-the-laws-of-human-nature) (New York Times bestseller, he's written for 50 Cent and Jay Z, knows power dynamics inside out). He argues that people are drawn to those who seem to have an internal compass, not those desperately seeking external validation. When you walk in with purpose, even if that purpose is just curiosity, you emit completely different energy.

6. Practice strategic vulnerability

Counterintuitive but being slightly imperfect actually makes you more approachable and real. Brené Brown's entire career is built on this (millions of books sold, viral TED talks, research professor at University of Houston).

Don't walk in pretending you're flawless and completely comfortable. If someone asks how you're doing, it's fine to say something like ""Honestly a bit nervous, I don't know many people here yet, but excited to meet some cool humans."" That's way more magnetic than a fake perfect performance.

The key word is ""strategic."" You're not trauma dumping or spiraling. You're just admitting you're human, which paradoxically makes you seem more confident because only secure people can admit vulnerability.

7. Build the skill in low stakes environments

You can't expect to feel comfortable walking into high pressure rooms if you never practice. Start small. Coffee shops, bookstores, casual meetups.

Challenge yourself to make brief eye contact and smile at three strangers. Strike up a 30 second conversation with a barista beyond just ordering. Sit at a communal table instead of hiding in the corner.

Each tiny interaction builds evidence for your brain that you can exist in spaces without imploding. Eventually walking into bigger rooms gets easier because you've accumulated proof that you survive, even thrive.

8. Remember everyone else is faking it too

Last thing, this genuinely helped me: almost everyone in that room is at least somewhat uncomfortable. Even the people who seem super confident are often just better actors.

That person who looks totally at ease? Probably rehearsed their entrance. That group laughing loudly? Might be overcompensating for awkwardness. The person holding court? Could be terrified of silence.

You're not uniquely anxious or out of place. You're just human in a situation that triggers our deep evolutionary fear of social rejection. Everyone's running similar software, some just hide it better.

The goal isn't to never feel nervous. It's to act like you belong WHILE feeling nervous. That's actual confidence. Doing the thing despite the fear, not because the fear disappeared.

I’ve been differing with gastritis for about a year and a half. It’s been a long road to recovery and although I’m not cured I’m 80% better if not more some days. I wanted to share what I’ve been doing in hopes that it could help even one person. I’ve been doing my own research and working with my functional medicine doctor. My GI has been no help, whatsoever. Here is a list of things I did. 

\- Famotidine 20mg - started only at night as directed by my GI. I saw a GI at Mayo Clinic and she said it would be safe to use it morning and night for a couple of months. I did that and was able to wean to only once a day. I now only use it in the morning bc the burning for me was worse upon waking up. I feel like I could slowly start tapering now. Fingers crossed! 

\-take a good probiotic

\- I eliminated coffee 

\- I don’t eat gluten or dairy (inflammatory foods) 

\- I limit alcohol to 1-2x a month 

\- no spicy/acidic food and I limit greasy food (my diet is healthy overall) 

\- I take BPC157/KPV oral capsules from a compounding pharmacy 2x a day. This helps a lot. 

\- 3000mg glutamine daily split into 2 doses 

\- zinc carsonine - since starting this I’ve seen a huge improvement 

\- I’m taking 1 tsp of colloidal silver for some gut bacteria I’m treating. It’s helping so maybe there is a link with the bacteria and gastritis? Not sure but something is working. 

\- take your omegas and curcumin

\- I’m also just starting DGL before meals. I’m on day 3 so I can’t speak on that yet but I’ve read a lot of good things about it. 

Hope this can help someone bc it all helped me a lot. Feel free to ask any questions! Wishing us all good health :) ",1,1770990240.0,Gastritis,3,1.0,False

This t-shirt is what happens when “Netflix and chill” takes a psychedelic detour and never comes back.

This shirt isn’t a plan — it’s a vibe. It’s ironic. It’s absurd. It’s the kind of phrase that makes people do a double take and then nervously laugh while trying to figure out if you’re serious.

You’re not promoting anything. You’re promoting energy.

This tee is perfect for:

• Festival season

• Late-night hangs

• Art kids and chaos gremlins

• Anyone whose personality includes “questionable suggestions”

• Weird and fun uncles

• Grandparents who like to chill and vape probably 

Soft, comfortable, and just subtle enough to wear in public while still causing mild emotional turbulence. It’s playful rebellion in cotton form — bright, weird, and fully committed to making you stand out.

Because sometimes “let’s grab coffee” is boring. Sometimes you need a shirt that escalates immediately.

Relax. It’s a joke.

The most useful takeaways for me 1 don’t plan the perfect schedule plan a minimum floor you can do on any day even a bad one like 10 minutes and one specific task 2 master the fundamentals before chasing the “fun” stuff because chaos kills consistency faster than anything 3 recovery is part of training not a reward for it otherwise you burn out and start skipping 4 doing it badly is better than staying silent and waiting for the perfect moment mistakes mean movement silence is the real stop button I stopped trying to be the perfect learner and started being the person who doesn’t skip and that alone has been surprisingly motivating because every day you prove to yourself you can keep your word

If you relate to I start strong and then fade try a one-week experiment pick one habit set a minimum floor decide your trigger in advance after coffee after a shower before bed and track not how much you did but whether you did it at all By the end of the week it usually clicks discipline isn’t about being harsh it’s about taking care of your future self small actions that don’t require heroics but compound into steady progress

Oh Terry, I really think you're great, but this tape nonsense is so, so bad. Why does 1985 Neighbours find it so hard to write people out?

Tapegate continues to dominate this week, so to recap: the tape is still missing, and everyone thinks everyone else has it. Barbara is now probably pretending to have come over to the good guys for some reason. It's still unclear if Terry's actually done anything illegal. It's even more unclear why she got with her husband's criminal associate after leaving him. She still doesn't have a gun, and we've ambling around this nonsense ever since the wedding. Not long left, thankfully!

Also this week, George and Eileen also leave in a puff of smoke (after a snap proposal, of course!). Please tell me it's not too long until Mrs Clarke rides again. Temu Mrs Mangel applies for Helen's, ahem, job, at the Robinsons', and faced with the prospect of maybe doing some housework Jim finally decides to go to work. Though he does look worryingly like a man about to impulsively propose to candidate number two... Also, everyone starts to go to the coffee shop instead of the bank! It'll never catch on.

Most importantly, Julie Robinson did indeed leave home without a word, and gets but two indirect mentions the entire week. Justice for Julie!",2,1770989685.0,neighbours,0,1.0,False

I recently found Index file manager from the Mauikit, and have been using it and really liking it. I love the overall look and feel - more modern kind of feel to it. But I am wanting to customize some settings to my preferences and whatnot, and have not been able to find much online like a forum or anything like that for help. Is there one that anyone knows of, or even an in-depth Wiki or user documentation?

I am really right now just trying to figure out how to set some custom folder icons for some of the entries under Quick Places and Bookmarks. I can set the folder icons easily for the most part but the links under Bookmarks for a folder with a custom icon does not show that icon next to the folder name in Bookmarks.

I have not tried it yet with anything in Quick Places yet, but was also trying to figure out if I can change any of the entries in Quick Places or adjust that panel in any way. Right now, every folder showing in the Quick Places panel is just a white folder and I can only actually tell what a given folder is by hovering over it and waiting for the little popup box with its name to show up. I'd rather be able to either see the name below the folder or change the icon to something specific I can recognize easily just by looking.

Any help or advice is greatly appreciated!!

I've done a few long fasts (one 18 days, one 14 days) 4 years ago and got down to my ideal weight of 130. But anxiety and stress around my job and being a remote worker, I let myself go again. 

The last time I was ever 191, I was 2 days away from giving birth.  So you can imagine my shock when I got on the scale Saturday after a year. 

I'm shooting for the 40 day fast because I know it's all mental.  Aside from a few hunger pains in the middle of the night and insomnia I have no problems. I take my electrolytes and have coffee, water, soda water with 0 calories.

My eating is 100% out of boredom.  Fasting clears my head and I do productive things like clean out my closet and garage to keep myself busy the past few days. 

Why 40 days? I'm the type that it goes all or nothing unfortunately. I used to workout insane hours and was in amazing physical shape in my late 20, early 30s. I used to count every calorie. I think I decided to rebel because even though I was in amazing shape, I was miserable.

I know I can do 40 and picked that number based on a video I saw on youtube where the woman did 30. She said, I'm going to do 30, and she did.  She didn't care if the scale didn't move one week. It forced her to keep going because she had the number 30. So, 40 here I come.  

I have before pictures and can't wait until I post my after. 

Stay tuned!

I tried the ""no coffee before 10 AM"" thing, the cold showers, the 5 AM wakeups but nothing worked.

Then I realized the problem wasnt my body; it was the 45-minute train ride.

I'd spend the entire commute scrolling my phone. By the time I hit the office, I'd already processed hundreds of headlines, 20 emails, and a dozen Reddit threads. My eyes were tired and my brain was basicaly overstimulated before I even opened my laptop.

For the last two weeks, I've banned my phone on the train. Total screen detox.

The first few days were akward, just staring at the back of someones head, but its actually changed my entire day. I tried reading a book but so far I dont think I really enjoy reading, maybe I havent found the right book to read just yet. I've started using that time to just ""think out loud."" I wear my daily glasses anyway (I have those audio-only Dymesty), so I just use the walk from the station to verbaly ""braindump"" my priorities into my notes app.

Instead of scrolling, Im looking out the window and just talking through what I actualy need to get done. I arive at my desk feeling... quiet. No eye strain, no dopamine crash, just a clear list of what I need to do. My thoughts get more organized as I have spent the past 30 minutes dumping all my thoughts out. Its the first time in years I havent felt like Im playing catch-up at 9:00 AM.

I’m opening up slots for small restaurant/cafe owners who need high-level culinary direction but can't afford to hire a full-time Executive Chef (which usually costs ₱70k - ₱100k++).

**Who I am:**

* **5 Years as Corporate Chef** for a popular Italian restaurant chain here in PH (I know operations, scaling, and consistency).
* **Former Personal Chef to the Former Spanish Ambassador** to the Philippines (I know high-end quality).
* Specialist in **R&D (Research & Development)** I don't just cook; I engineer menus that sell and are profitable.
* **11 Years Total Industry Experience.**
* **Currently acting as an F&B Director for known restaurants and bars around the Metro.**
* More experience available upon contacting me.

**The Problem:** Most small food businesses fail because they have great ideas but poor execution. You might be losing money on food costs, your menu might be too big/confusing, or your kitchen workflow is slow. You don't need a full-time chef standing there 12 hours a day, you need a strategist to set the systems and recipes.

**The Solution:** I am offering a **Virtual Corporate Chef** package. For a fixed, affordable monthly fee, I act as your culinary partner. We work 100% remotely. You provide the vision, I provide the corporate-grade systems to make it work.

**What you get:**

* **Menu Engineering:** Review of your current menu to identify high-profit vs. dead-weight items.
* **R&D:** Development of 1-2 new monthly specials sent to you as a complete deployment kit (Recipe + Costing).
* **Food Cost Audit:** I will calculate the *actual* food cost of your top sellers to ensure you are actually making money.
* **Supplier Access:** I can recommend suppliers I’ve trusted for a decade to help you lower costs.
* **On-Call Consultation:** Direct line to me for kitchen emergencies or troubleshooting.

**Who is this for?**

* Coffee shop owners who want to expand into hot meals but don't know how.
* Small restaurant owners struggling with consistency or high wastage.
* Home-based food businesses looking to scale up to a physical store.

**Why Remote?**

* It is significantly cheaper for you. You aren't paying for my commute or physical presence.
* It forces your team to learn the *system* rather than relying on a chef to hover over them.

**The Deal:**

* **Price:** 10,000php per month per brand.
* **Terms:** Retainer fee is paid **upfront** at the start of the month. No lock-in period, but I only take on a limited number of clients to ensure quality.

I bridge the gap between ""home cook"" passion and ""corporate chain"" profitability.

**Interested?** Send me a DM with a brief description of your business (concept, location, and current biggest struggle). Let’s schedule a quick chat to see if we’re a fit.",2,1770989310.0,classifiedsph,1,1.0,False
1r3p5ej,https://www.ft.com/content/4d1b3603-9d94-46d0-b70c-1dc28e5f7cc1,The college finance recruiting pipeline is insane,"(I know FT is serious about the paywall, so I'm copy-pasting the article here). As a student at a similar school, I can confirm that the process is ridiculous. I know people who have sent *hundreds* of emails, and that's considered low. Some of my friends were stressing about internships before finishing freshman orientation week. One of my friends had to do coffee chats and two rounds of interviews to join a finance club. People are skipping class to drill technicals, joining early insights programs in freshman year, waiting in lines out the door to hand a first-year Goldman anlayst their resume, the list goes on. Even if you're a top applicant and get a first wave, final round superday, you'll be one of hundreds interviewing for that day alone.

The playing field has only gotten bigger, and at many of these places (Bulge Bracket, Elite Boutique banks, etc.) the acceptance rate is lower than the Ivies these people attend. Just take a look at WallStreetOasis, and you'll see how neurotic this whole thing is. At the same time, it is an assured path to wealth and success provided you're willing to sacrifice 80-100 work weeks (at least for IB. S&T, ER, AM, are slightly better). The same goes for consulting, but we don't need to talk about that.

>  
  
**How elite college finance clubs pave the way to Wall Street**  
For George, a first-year undergraduate at The Wharton School, evenings on campus looked very different to what many other freshman students might expect.   
  
Rather than partying or working on course assignments, he says classmates at the University of Pennsylvania’s business school would fill study rooms in the library until midnight, preparing applications for highly selective finance clubs organised and managed by his fellow students.   
  
These members-only extracurricular clubs give students an intensive introduction to a future career in investment banking and can act as a crucial pathway into some of the most coveted jobs on Wall Street.   
  
But they are attracting fresh attention as the entry point into a system in which young people thinking about a career in high finance are having to make big choices in their early 20s and even late teens for jobs they will not start for many years.   
“The cost of being hyper career-focused too young is that you trade curiosity for certainty,” says Vitoria Okuyama, a former professional tennis player who later joined the investment banking group at Citi and is now a commentator on finance careers.   
  
Junior investment banking jobs are coveted for many reasons, from pay to prestige — but they are also seen as a route into multimillion-dollar careers in other sectors, such as private equity and hedge funds.   
  
Large US private equity firms completed their graduate recruitment intake for 2027 early this month, hiring a round of first-year bankers, six months out of university, in a single day of frantic interviews and assessments. Candidates were called on a Sunday night and told to appear the next morning at various conference rooms across midtown Manhattan. Many successful applicants were given offers the same day.   
  
The hiring spree was delayed by a few months after bankers including JPMorgan Chase’s Jamie Dimon last summer hit out at private equity firms such as Apollo and KKR for signing up junior analysts who had only just started their training on Wall Street. But its return soon into the new year highlighted how the pressured recruitment timetable in finance is showing little sign of easing. Many of the banks themselves scout for candidates who are just 18 or 19, setting a clock for students who have just left high school to think seriously about career decisions with little in the way of real-world seasoning. Those that fail to secure a top internship risk missing out on the best bank training schemes — and job opportunities further down the road.   
  
The result is a relentless career focus from a young age, with colleges, financial institutions, headhunters and others part of a fiercely competitive and at times dysfunctional system.   
  
“I wish I had gotten more \[time\] to explore,” says one college junior who has already locked up his dream banking internship.   
  
All sides seem to be dissatisfied with this status quo. But any collective action to improve it has been slow, as each company has an individual incentive to pluck the most promising prospects before their rivals do.   
  
“We have had many discussions over years with the banks about why we don’t feel that the current hiring timeline makes sense for them or the students, but nothing seems to have changed,” says Barbara Hewitt, executive director of Penn’s career services department.   
  
The finance rat race used to be less frenzied. More than 25 years ago, when I was a college student, I recall music majors stumbling upon the career centre during their senior year and landing at McKinsey. When I decided to go into investment banking, I did not need to do much until late into my third year of college. My dad took me to buy a cheap suit for a handful of summer internship interviews, none of which proved successful. But I had no trouble securing an offer when most students got their entry-level job: senior year with graduation just a few months away.   
  
The timing has now shifted far earlier. Wall Street banks typically fill summer internship slots during students’ second year of college, more than a year before they take place. Those interns will account for nearly all the full-time trainees starting two years later.   
  
The system forces nervous students to get their ducks in a row essentially from the moment they set foot on campus.   
  
With this in mind, virtually all big public and private universities now offer professionally focused finance clubs that help students prepare for careers on Wall Street. First years often seek places in these clubs within weeks of moving into their dormitory rooms.   
  
The funnelling begins with the club selection, a process largely supervised by the students themselves. George, the Wharton student who did not want to use his full name in case it put him at a disadvantage with potential employers, says those throwing their weight around on campus are increasingly not athletes or star scholars but second and third-year students who have secured prestige internships.   
  
Eighteen-year-olds who want to join these clubs are subjected to rigorous exams and an intensive interview, with perhaps only 10 per cent or fewer of an already elite pool being accepted. Even though they happen in the first year of college, when most students have not settled on one specific career, they are regarded as an important way to showcase drive, ambition and intellect to prospective employers.   
  
Alok, in his final years at the University of Chicago, recalls the mania when around a third of the 1,700 year group initially sought to join the finance club. The process included getting picked for a six-week training programme and then passing an exam. Around 30 students are selected each cycle. “It’s a decent amount of stress . . . it sort of sucks,” Alok says.   
  
Wharton School is widely considered to be one of the largest feeders into banking jobs. Its finance club has several branches that replicate a Wall Street trading desk, with names such as “special situations” (special sits) and “tactical opportunities” (tac ops). Discussions about which to pursue even start at gatherings of high school students who have just received college acceptances.   
  
Students might spend their meetings conducting case studies of buyouts or pitching stocks to buy from a modest-sized fund, often endowed by alumni to invest real money. They learn spreadsheets and discounted cash flow models, while they read Plato or conduct chemistry experiments for their main degree. “Wharton is very big on herd mentality . . . the clubs take precedence over school,” says George.   
  
The schools themselves are struggling to keep up. Wharton has tried to lower the temperature and regulate interview processes at the student-run clubs to prevent them favouring privileged applicants.   
  
The FT contacted several banks to ask why they are still chasing students who have just started college and all declined to comment.   
  
Okuyama says students pursuing finance careers are taking the path of least resistance at a moment in their lives when they should be exploring multiple options.   
  
“They risk going blindly into those fields, only to realise two years later that they hate the path they’re on and have to reinvent themselves.   
  
“But the greater danger is getting comfortable on that path and living an unfulfilled career simply because they never questioned it.”   
  
After competing hard to join Wharton’s finance club, George was ultimately accepted. With one year under his belt, he feels the process was over the top but still perhaps productive. “The club scene forces students to get better or risk being left behind,” he says.",7,1770989290.0,redscarepod,13,0.82,False

1r3p4me,https://www.reddit.com/r/phclassifieds/comments/1r3p4me/for_hire_virtual_corporate_chef_for_small_fb_rd/,[For Hire] Virtual Corporate Chef for Small F&B. R&D + Systems + Costing,"Hi everyone,

I’m opening up slots for small restaurant/cafe owners who need high-level culinary direction but can't afford to hire a full-time Executive Chef (which usually costs ₱70k - ₱100k++).

**Who I am:**

* **5 Years as Corporate Chef** for a popular Italian restaurant chain here in PH (I know operations, scaling, and consistency).
* **Former Personal Chef to the Former Spanish Ambassador** to the Philippines (I know high-end quality).
* Specialist in **R&D (Research & Development)** I don't just cook; I engineer menus that sell and are profitable.
* **11 Years Total Industry Experience.**
* **Currently acting as an F&B Director for known restaurants and bars around the Metro.**
* More experience available upon contacting me.

**The Problem:** Most small food businesses fail because they have great ideas but poor execution. You might be losing money on food costs, your menu might be too big/confusing, or your kitchen workflow is slow. You don't need a full-time chef standing there 12 hours a day, you need a strategist to set the systems and recipes.

**The Solution:** I am offering a **Virtual Corporate Chef** package. For a fixed, affordable monthly fee, I act as your culinary partner. We work 100% remotely. You provide the vision, I provide the corporate-grade systems to make it work.

**What you get:**

* **Menu Engineering:** Review of your current menu to identify high-profit vs. dead-weight items.
* **R&D:** Development of 1-2 new monthly specials sent to you as a complete deployment kit (Recipe + Costing).
* **Food Cost Audit:** I will calculate the *actual* food cost of your top sellers to ensure you are actually making money.
* **Supplier Access:** I can recommend suppliers I’ve trusted for a decade to help you lower costs.
* **On-Call Consultation:** Direct line to me for kitchen emergencies or troubleshooting.

**Who is this for?**

* Coffee shop owners who want to expand into hot meals but don't know how.
* Small restaurant owners struggling with consistency or high wastage.
* Home-based food businesses looking to scale up to a physical store.

**Why Remote?**

* It is significantly cheaper for you. You aren't paying for my commute or physical presence.
* It forces your team to learn the *system* rather than relying on a chef to hover over them.

**The Deal:**

* **Price:** 10,000php per month per brand.
* **Terms:** Retainer fee is paid **upfront** at the start of the month. No lock-in period, but I only take on a limited number of clients to ensure quality.

I bridge the gap between ""home cook"" passion and ""corporate chain"" profitability.

**Interested?** Send me a DM with a brief description of your business (concept, location, and current biggest struggle). Let’s schedule a quick chat to see if we’re a fit.",1,1770989231.0,phclassifieds,1,1.0,False

What's this?,"Wednesday morning, two days ago, I was preparing breakfast for my kids when suddenly I became ill and walked outside to puke.  A few moments later I vomited black.  Probably 12 oz. Unsure that it was blood because it was dark still, I began to walk back inside.  A few moments later I returned for round two and threw up bright blood.  Then I just laid on the ground for a moment dry heaving blood...

My wife and I had a gift card to a coffee shop we wanted to use after dropping off her car for service.  But unfortunately, that plan was derailed by the most horrifying thing I've experienced.

We drove to the hospital ER and I was able to walk in on my own.  I left five hours later.  My blood pressure had dropped to 55 over 32  but had stabilized about 100 over 75.

About me.  I'm a 44 year old male.  I am 6 ft 2, 180 lbs.  I run and have three young children.  Yea.  We had kids late.  What gives?  I've never had stomach issues before.  I don't drink or take aspirin.  The only thing I can think of is our last house had untreated well water. Maybe I picked up that bacteria I keep reading about.

I'm scared to eat much.  Any help understanding what you think may have happened here?

Edit for more info.  I have an appt with a GI doc this evening.

1r3oyqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1r3oyqt/found_a_cafe_bar_with_great_potential_but_the/,"Found a cafe bar with great potential, but the owner is one of the most frustrating people I've ever met.","I'm a nerd and this is the first ever cafe bar where I felt at home in my life. It's UFO themed, there's a PS5, and it's never crowded. There are also two resident dogs that are great therapy, and in general I could do anything I feel like. For example, recently a new album came out which I quite liked so I went there and the owner played it for me.

Problem is, the owner's crazy. He's autistic but that's not inherently bad. I'm autistic too. We're both clinically diagnosed. He's so obnoxious, though. He yaps non-stop and it's often TMI. First time I went, I felt good about it because we talked a lot and I don't usually have conversations with strangers. Then after a while I realised this guy just can't shut up. I take books with me to read and he talks to me even if I'm reading with airpods on. I noticed him talk to many customers who looked clearly disinterested. He even jokes about scaring people away and says he's, ""not for everyone"". The cafe is failing and he's not even making enough to pay off the rent. Bro, if you're not for everyone, then adapt. The least you could do is not talk people's ears off?

His girlfriend helps him with the cafe bar rent and pays their rent, as in, their apartment's rent. She even goes straight to the cafe after work to help out even though the guy could manage on his own. She never complains about this. You know what she complains about? Him going on these crazy weekends full of hard drugs and not picking up the phone and then spending a whole week depressed from the comedown of said drugs. She says she'll leave him if he doesn't stop doing that, but does he stop? No. Every week he tells me about his last, crazy weekend.

It's nice when I'm there. We listen to good music, play videogames, and go on these deep conversations that I quite like, but he's always on my ass to buy more coffee or something to eat. I spend enough there. He can't complain, but he's always on me. I finish my specialty coffee and he asks me if I want a refill the moment I put it down. I ask for a refill twice and feel like that's enough. Those things are expensive and they have a really good profit margin, but he keeps wanting more. He's like my grandma but rather than my well-being, he wants my money. It's not like I'm gonna spend a fortune every time I'm there. I spend a reasonable amount of money. I'm not rich. He should focus on getting more customers rather than bothering the ones he gets.

Speaking of getting more customers, he completely rejects any advice regarding marketing and making the place look better. He doesn't market the place and the only reason I found it was because it was on the way from where I parked my car to the place where I buy cat food. Inside looks dreadful. It's a hodgepodge of alien stuff from different eras and different genres (horror figurines, soft toys, vintage alien toys, etc) and the very serious, dark, and modern furniture that was there from the previous cafe. The walls are black with olive green for peat's sake. He hung mosaic, black and white pictures of aliens that are in terrible taste. The place is horrendous.

Why does it always have to be something? Why can't I just have a cool UFO themed cafe bar for nerds around here with no catch?",2,1770988796.0,rant,0,1.0,False

Today I am going to stop taking my medication to increase the chances of dying soon (the heart issuse isn't the reason that I can't get a licesne)

22M I posted about that before that I can't get a driving licesne due to a health con and I'm a lesser because of it and I've planned my suicide and I've never been happier. Whoever says a driving license doesn't ruin the quality of life is either delusional or lying

Other forms of transport like bikes, ebikes, or mopeds aren’t as good. They’re very limited and can’t even take you far and they aren’t as comfortable and walkable cities are not something I want and I can't move I just want a licesne it's not hard to understand

No matter what argument or solution you choose, having a license will always be a million times better. Not having one has ruined my whole life, and it doesn’t feel worth living anymore

I already requested a withdrawal from my university, even though I have a scholarship, but I really don’t care. What’s the point of a degree if you can’t even be independent enough to move around by yourself?

My girlfriend is so annoying. I told her to leave me alone, but she keeps coming back saying things like, “A driving license doesn’t matter to me trust me and stuff like that.

Like what does that have to do with you? This is about me My identity doesn’t revolve around you. I honestly don’t understand what “it doesn’t matter to me” is supposed to mean. If it doesn’t matter to you, fine but it matters to me. I have my own identity

Then she says a driving license isn’t important trust me but I didn’t reply because she already has a license, which means it clearly does matter. That’s why it feels like a lie when she said that

and she came again asking if we could go out for coffee to talk about it, but I left her on seen because there’s nothing to talk about and we haven't talked or met in 2 days now but she said that you can take all the time you need and stuff like that

And I don’t care anymore about uni because I’ve spent my last days entirely in bed, and I haven’t gone outside the apartment at all. I’m ready to end it all, and please don’t give basic solutions like walkable cities, buses, or similar thing

1r3oxl8,https://www.reddit.com/r/MenAscending/comments/1r3oxl8/how_to_be_romantic_the_sciencebased_playbook_that/,How to Be ROMANTIC: The Science-Based Playbook That Actually Works,"Been studying this for months because honestly, modern dating feels BROKEN. We're all chronically online, overstimulated, and have zero clue how to connect without it feeling forced or cringe. Scrolled through endless relationship advice, dove into psychology research, listened to Esther Perel's podcast religiously, read actual studies on attachment theory. What I found completely changed how I see romance.

Here's the thing nobody tells you: romance isn't about grand gestures or expensive dates. It's about intentional attention in a world designed to distract you. We're all so dopamine fried that genuine presence feels revolutionary. The dating industrial complex wants you thinking you need perfect date ideas and flawless execution. Bullshit. What people actually crave is feeling SEEN.

The art of paying attention is where real romance lives. Not checking your phone during dinner. Remembering the small stuff they mentioned three weeks ago. Noticing when their mood shifts. Sounds obvious but when's the last time someone gave you their full attention for an hour straight? Probably never. We're all half present, half scrolling, always waiting for something better. Break that pattern and you'll stand out like crazy.

Dr Sue Johnson (she literally wrote the book on emotionally focused therapy and has 30+ years researching couples) talks about this in [Hold Me Tight](https://www.amazon.com/Hold-Me-Tight-Conversations-Lifetime/dp/031611300X). She breaks down how emotional responsiveness creates secure bonds. The book won awards for basically proving that vulnerability and attentiveness matter more than compatibility. Read it and you'll understand why your ex relationships failed. Seriously, this book will make you question everything you thought you knew about love. Best relationship psychology I've ever encountered. It's not some fluffy self help garbage, it's clinical research made digestible.

Ask better questions. Stop with the ""how was your day"" bullshit. Try ""what made you feel most alive today?"" or ""what's something you've been thinking about lately that you haven't told anyone?"" Genuine curiosity is disgustingly romantic. Most people ask questions just to fill silence. Ask because you actually want to know their inner world.

Create tiny rituals together. Could be making coffee a certain way every Sunday. Could be a specific song you play on car rides. Could be a dumb inside joke nobody else gets. These microscopic traditions build your own private universe. Couples who last have their own language, their own ecosystem.

The Paired app is actually clutch here for building that connection. It's like Duolingo but for relationships, sends you and your partner daily questions that get progressively deeper. You'd be surprised what you DON'T know about someone you've dated for months. Helps you move past surface level conversation into actual intimacy territory without it feeling like therapy homework.

There's also this AI-powered learning app called [BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been useful for understanding relationship dynamics better. It pulls from relationship research, expert insights, and books like the ones mentioned here to create personalized audio content based on what you're struggling with. You can tell it your specific situation, like ""I want to be more emotionally available but not needy"" or ""help me understand attachment styles in my relationship,"" and it generates a custom learning plan. The depth is adjustable too, so you can get a quick 15-minute overview or a deep 40-minute dive with real examples. Makes absorbing this psychology stuff way easier when you're commuting or at the gym.

Anticipate needs before they ask. This is next level. Notice they always get cold at restaurants? Bring a jacket without being asked. Know they stress about work presentations? Text them encouragement that morning. See they're exhausted? Run them a bath. Small acts of service that show you're paying attention to their patterns. That's the language of devotion.

Alain de Botton's work on this is unmatched. [The Course of Love](https://www.amazon.com/Course-Love-Novel-Alain-Botton/dp/1501134515/ref=sr_1_1?adgrpid=139616790941&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.1QEv3yd8CFHQP4_WTVdHb03JgXbPbzH8HYBoB9LXUt9a3Cn0uDIgRC5KgrU_zDsotSyI76rqp44WWZElnzs8K_Yw4ZPs_juZ3SIRa5T6SGtmSQ4oQVOt4zEYK2_0oOHg8_fmIlEbeA3LcsoJoqrE3Nvwcb9ouYDogxhc-TZz5TG-w-ex_eZxWF9I0dH5YQGd_-GNifgzFSqPrtOUGlsDQ-XQ-NjqxYOkupbXzrACJQE.rppWyPP9LzCPpKy6CzsjzlXbPQnaD2MGIf_pe4vMMEE&dib_tag=se&hvadid=630182539657&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9060949&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=e&hvrand=12343371496121732716&hvtargid=kwd-300432630709&hydadcr=28510_14666745&keywords=the+course+of+love&mcid=bdb154f6cea33cb39842174224b58b95&qid=1770965025&sr=8-1) explores how relationships actually function past the honeymoon phase. He's a philosopher who founded The School of Life, and this book reads like watching your future relationship play out with all its beautiful messiness. Insanely good read that shows romance isn't about constant passion, it's about choosing someone even when it's boring or hard. Most romantic books are fantasy, this one is REAL.

Be present during sex but also outside of it. Physical intimacy matters obviously, but romance is sustained through nonsexual touch. Holding hands while walking. Playing with their hair while watching TV. Random hugs from behind while they're cooking. Skin to skin contact releases oxytocin which literally bonds you together. We're just mammals who need touch.

Write things down. Doesn't have to be poetry or love letters. Just observations. ""You looked happy today when you were talking about your friend's wedding."" ""I love how passionate you get about random documentaries."" Keeps you noticing the details that make them THEM.

The Gottman Institute's research (they've studied thousands of couples over 40+ years) shows that successful relationships have a 5:1 ratio of positive to negative interactions. Basically you need five good moments to balance one shitty moment. So romance isn't perfection, it's consistently showing up with small kindnesses that outnumber the inevitable conflicts. They have a card deck app that's weirdly helpful for sparking actual conversations instead of just existing next to each other in silence.

Be emotionally available but not needy. Share your feelings without making them your therapist. Ask for support without demanding they fix you. Secure attachment looks like ""I'm struggling with something, can we talk?"" not ""you're making me feel this way."" Understanding this distinction is massive.

Here's what's wild: once you start practicing this stuff it stops feeling like effort. Becomes automatic. Your brain literally rewires to notice opportunities for connection. Neuroplasticity works for love too. You're training yourself to be someone who SEES people fully, and that skill transfers everywhere.

The real enemy of romance is autopilot. We get comfortable and stop trying. Stop noticing. Stop being curious. Relationships die from boredom and neglect way more than dramatic betrayals. So the ultimate romantic move is refusing to let your attention drift. Staying fascinated by this person you chose. That's the actual work, and nobody warns you about it because it's not Instagram worthy.

But when you get it right? When someone feels truly cherished and known by you? That's the stuff that lasts past the butterflies and initial chemistry. That's the foundation for building something real in a world full of shallow connections and infinite options.

In 2026, it represents something deeper, personalization, intelligent functionality, and seamless aesthetics that enhance everyday living. Today’s premium homeowners are not just designing kitchens; they’re curating experiences where design, technology, and lifestyle merge effortlessly.

# As homes become more expressive and lifestyle-driven, kitchens are evolving into sophisticated spaces that balance elegance with performance. From smart storage to sustainable materials, the modern kitchen trends shaping high-end homes reveal one thing clearly: luxury now means thoughtful design.

# Let’s explore what defines the next generation of premium kitchens and what discerning homeowners expect from the [**best modular kitchens**](https://wurfel.in/) this year.

https://preview.redd.it/926whp1bi9jg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=a45cf68239babf7572341233044fca47a4bafa5c

# 1. Personalised Layouts Over Standard Designs

Cookie-cutter layouts are fading fast. Premium homeowners want kitchens tailored to their routines, how they cook, host, and live.

Designers are creating highly customized zones such as breakfast counters, hidden prep areas, appliance garages, and dedicated coffee or bar stations. Workflow efficiency is becoming a key priority, with layouts planned around movement rather than mere aesthetics.

A [**luxury modular kitchen in 2026**](https://wurfel.in/Luxury-Modular-kitchens.php) feels intuitive. Every drawer, shelf, and corner is designed with purpose, making the space effortless to use.

# 2. Seamless Minimalism with Statement Materials

Clean lines remain central to modern design, but minimalism is now warmer and more tactile. Instead of stark, clinical spaces, homeowners prefer layered textures and refined materials that add depth.

# Expect to see:

# • Fluted wood panels

# • Stone and marble countertops

# • Matte lacquer or glass finishes

# • Integrated lighting within cabinets

# • Handleless or concealed hardware

These materials create understated sophistication while keeping clutter out of sight. The goal is visual calm, where beauty meets function.

# 3. Smart Technology Integration

Technology has moved from “nice-to-have” to essential. Premium kitchens are becoming smarter and more responsive to daily needs.

Voice-controlled lighting, app-connected appliances, sensor-based drawers, and automated ventilation systems are redefining convenience. Built-in charging stations and hidden screens for recipes or entertainment are also becoming common.

Today’s premium modular kitchen blends technology invisibly, ensuring the space remains elegant without visible gadgets disrupting the design.

https://preview.redd.it/g81b0q2ci9jg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=5004947c514351aa4e21d1b5e9ca8b356ebf6d11

# 4. Sustainability as a Luxury Standard

Luxury is increasingly tied to responsibility. Environment-conscious homeowners are choosing eco-friendly materials that look good and reduce environmental impact.

Popular choices include:

• FSC-certified wood

• Recycled surfaces

• Water-based finishes

• Energy-efficient appliances

• Long-lasting modular components

This approach not only supports sustainability but also improves durability and indoor air quality. A thoughtfully crafted luxury modular kitchen now reflects both refined taste and mindful living.

# 5. Intelligent Storage That Disappears

Storage is becoming smarter, sleeker, and nearly invisible. Instead of bulky cabinets, designers are focusing on concealed solutions that maintain a clean aesthetic.

Features homeowners love:

• Pull-out pantry systems

• Corner carousels

• Deep drawer organizers

• Appliance lift-ups

• Hidden waste segregation units

These innovations maximize every inch of space while keeping countertops clutter-free. It’s this blend of practicality and polish that defines the best modular kitchens today.

# 6. Kitchens as Social Hubs

The kitchen is no longer a closed-off cooking space, it’s the heart of the home. Premium homeowners want kitchens that invite connection and conversation.

Open layouts, islands with seating, and fluid transitions into living or dining areas encourage interaction. Whether hosting friends or enjoying family time, the kitchen is now designed for gathering.

A well-designed luxury modular kitchen feels welcoming, stylish, and comfortable, equally suited for entertaining guests or enjoying quiet mornings.

https://preview.redd.it/kze8ao0di9jg1.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=1e159c25ab4b62ec5efb1dbd6d93d4c565578b81

# 7. Timeless Design Over Fast Trends

While trends inspire, longevity matters more. Homeowners are investing in designs that remain elegant for years rather than chasing fleeting styles.

Neutral palettes, versatile finishes, and modular flexibility allow kitchens to adapt over time. This ensures the space continues to feel premium without frequent renovations.

In essence, 2026’s [**premium modular kitchen**](https://blogs.wurfel.in/) philosophy is simple: design once, enjoy forever.

As we move into 2026, kitchens are becoming smarter, warmer, and more personal than ever before. The focus has shifted from excess to intention, from showing luxury to experiencing it.

# Whether through seamless storage, sustainable materials, or technology-driven convenience, the modern luxury modular kitchen is crafted around lifestyle, not just looks. For homeowners seeking the perfect balance of elegance and efficiency, investing in the best modular kitchens means creating a space that truly enhances everyday living.",1,1770988617.0,u_Wurfelkuche,0,1.0,False

You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant**. Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to - and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use Miro
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use Landwait(.)com
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use Google Docs
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Use Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical - and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**

I am currently using a cheap portable ceramic burr grinder with a 3 cup bialetti. I've been eyeing the delonghi EC890 for a while, but I've been told numerous time to get a capable grinder first, and then the espresso machine.         

A better grinder is more consistent, which results in better extraction and a cleaner cup.        

The question I ask is, is it still worth it chasing clarity and note distinction if I drink milk based?        

I am working with a budget of 15K for the grinder. I know I can add 5K more and go for Hibrew G5 or Baratza encore but even 15k is a stretch for me. I would have a hard time justifying to myself spending twenty thousand on a coffee grinder.        

My current setup is moka pot + mediocre grinder. For the best milk based drinks do I go route 

* a) Moka pot + good grinder

or

* b) Espresso machine + mediocre grinder (will have to use pressurized basket here)

Which one of these will yield better results? I understand that espresso requires a lot of tuning, learning and dialing in; and I am up for it.             

As mentioned, milk based drinks are my priority. Anyone who has gone through this phase in their brewing journey, your input is much appreciated.

# Episodes 23–24

* As the VP election approaches, Gu Chen escalates his attacks by weaponising Yu'an's past. Unfortunately, Jialu and Uncle finds out about Yi Jun's affair in the most awkward way possible.
* The evil team, I mean Gu Chen and his stooge, tries to imply that Jiaqi and Yu'an are having an affair of sorts, but during a high-stakes interview, Yu'an openly admits her feelings for Jiaqi  but frames them as respect and gratitude for how he helped her grandmother.
* The chairman overhears Yu'an's testimony and is quietly moved by her sincerity and is mad at the underhanded moves of Gu Chen and the slimy brown noser, especially after Gao reveals Yu'an's self-defense killing of Chen Ren's father to discredit Jiaqi 's judgment.

# Episodes 25–28

Although Jiaqi  wins the VP position he immediately resigns, much to the chairman's disappointment. Yu'an faces legal consequences with unexpected support, and one year later everyone finds new beginnings—some together, some apart.

**Key events:**

* Jiaqi discovers Yu'an's secret: that she had been spying on him via the listening app on his phone.
* Jiaqi finds Yu'an through a cleaning worker she'd helped, telling her: ""Even if life collapses, as long as you're alright, everything can start anew.""
* In the end, Jiaqi finds a way to let Yu'an and his friend off with a light punishment.  (Probably in exchange for the evidence to implicate Gu Chen?)
* Chen Ren leaves all the money she paid him at her grandmother's funeral before riding away silently
* Jiaqi resigns his VP position, founding Qiyuan Pharmaceuticals with Lao Song and colleagues joining him.
* Yi Jun accepts a position abroad to reunite with their son; Jiaqi supports her departure and seemed all supportive about it.

# What happened to the characters at the end?

**Gu Chen**  
His schemes unravel completely. Yu'an's recordings and hard drive evidence of his misconduct reaches the police. He's permanently dismissed from Sen'an and faces legal punishment.

**Vice President Gao**  
Fired alongside Gu Chen after weaponizing Yu'an's past during the VP election and delaying the announcement of voting results. Buh-bye!

**Jiaqi**  
He resigns shortly after winning the VP position, feeling the position should be returned to Pang Jian. After Yi Jun leaves for abroad, he lives alone.

You see him pottering about the house like a ... bachelor. But then he breaks down crying.

https://i.redd.it/v7z4e0q4h9jg1.gif

Why?

I personally believe it's because he finally had to face the reality that he couldn't save his marriage despite all the pain he had inflicted on himself. And that despite it all, he had failed at achieving the dream life he had wanted: the kind of he had with his family.

Or maybe because he could finally let out years of suppressed feelings because nobody was around.

Ironically, he finally found the courage to follow Yi Jun's advice to leave the company and create something for himself. Just exactly why, I'm not sure. Maybe he realised that being passive, hiding away and tolerating things quietly wasn't the way to achieve his dreams. I suppose he took to heart the lesson he learned from losing his family.

**Yi Jun**  
Is this an amicable parting? Are they still married? The drama never made it explicitly clear. But I'm leaning towards, yes, they're divorced or, no, they're keeping up appearances for their son, but they are all but divorced except in name.

Their separation feels bittersweet but mutually respectful.

**Yu'an**  
After disappearing to work at a supermarket (believing ""no one holds farewell parties for murderers""), she's found by Jiaqi. Following her grandmother's passing, she receives a job opportunity in Shenzhen from the chairman teaching sign language. One year later, she's transferred back to Chongqing and reconnects with Jiaqi at a coffee shop.

https://i.redd.it/a7029c77h9jg1.gif

Man, what a difference a year makes? I love that they showed that she now has friends, like any normal young woman. And her face is no longer darkened by grief. There's now hope in her eyes.

**Chen Ren**  
Our loan shark shows unexpected redemption at Yu'an's grandmother's funeral, leaving money and documents that clear Yu'an's name. He shares one silent, wordless look with Yu'an before riding away on his motorcycle, suggesting closure between them.

I never understood why he was so furious at Yu'an since he himself never really liked his own dad. But perhaps it was because he felt personally betrayed by her. So, while his ""redemption"" was unexpected, it didn't exactly filled me with warm, fluffy feelings. Like, good on you, babe. Now go forth and don't beat women again.

**Jialu & Youyou**

https://preview.redd.it/vs19rxh8h9jg1.jpg?width=1890&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c6e1ea0572a3c586041e7f9ef57d880c0075e725

They confess long-held feelings and begin dating. When Youyou's acting career takes off, Jialu selflessly pushes her into a taxi, believing his life as a truck driver shouldn't limit her potential. One year later, Youyou becomes a star while Jialu returns to scriptwriting. They reunite at Chu Dan's tavernm sitting opposite each other - I suppose their romance won't die. (*Restrains self from yawning*.)

**Chu Dan**  
She finally lets go of her years-long attachment to Zhiyuan's memory. She makes a new friend who loves the outdoors and plans a trek to Africa, embracing a fresh chapter.

**Uncle Yao** Uncle Yao and his wife reconcile and grow closer. Hokay, I guess lol. I mean I had zero doubts this would happen. It's as surprising as rain falling from the sky on an overcast day.

# My thoughts

What a lovely ending. I honestly, honestly, honestly don't want Jiaqi and Yu'an to end up as a CP. Their friendship and unique connection is beyond that, in my opinion.

It's the understanding of two mutual souls who had been in  very desperate situations. They *saved each other*. Jiaqi, with his empathy and kindness. Yu'an with her sleuthing, intelligence and yes, kindness.

Two souls that had started out suspicious and wary of each other formed a connection that transcends romantic love - that's how I see it.

https://preview.redd.it/xjsancdkh9jg1.png?width=889&format=png&auto=webp&s=784058052b88d2a17135d5e404bf127b0097ad31

The drama isn't perfect, of course. It was excruciatingly draggy at some parts and I honestly wished they had trimmed down the show further.

Was Jialu and Uncle's story necessary? I don't know. Sure, they exist to show the kind of family Jiaqi wanted and couldn't acheve with Yi Jun. But beyond that? I don't know, too much air time was given to them and I never understood how their storylines benefited the main one.

On the whole, I really loved Loving Strangers. A quiet, moving drama with solid performances from our leads.

# Let's discuss:

1. Did you think Yu'an really loved Jiaqi romantically or was it respect all the while?
2. After a year, do you think their meetup again signals romance? Well, personally I really hope not. I prefer them staying friends!! How about you?
3. Why did you think Jiaqi resigned the VP position and started his own company, especially since he fought against Yi Jun's advice at the start?
4. Do you think Yi Jun and Jiaqi are now divorced, or is this ""a break""?
5. What do you think of each character's ending?",3,1770988355.0,CDrama,0,0.81,False

Like, genuinely clueless. Someone could literally be leaning into my personal space, laughing at my objectively unfunny jokes, and I'd still convince myself they were ""just being nice."" Then I fell down this rabbit hole of behavioral psychology, body language research, and honestly way too many hours watching Vanessa Van Edwards and reading relationship psychologists like Esther Perel. What I found completely changed how I navigate social interactions.



The thing is, attraction isn't this mysterious force that only ""naturally charismatic"" people can detect. It's actually pretty systematic once you understand the psychological and biological mechanisms behind it. Our brains are wired to display interest in specific, observable ways, thanks to the limbic system (the emotional processing center) triggering involuntary responses before our conscious mind even catches up. The problem? Most of us are so caught up in our own heads, worrying about how WE'RE coming across, that we miss these signals entirely.



Here's what actually matters when someone's into you.



\*\*[Pupil dilation](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) is one of the most reliable indicators.\*\* This isn't some pseudo-science BS. When we see something (or someone) we find attractive, our pupils literally dilate due to increased dopamine and norepinephrine. Obviously you're not going to whip out a ruler mid-conversation, but in decent lighting, it's surprisingly noticeable. Pair this with prolonged eye contact (holding your gaze 2-3 seconds longer than typical conversation requires) and you've got a pretty strong signal. The neuroscience here is fascinating. Our brains process faces we find attractive differently, activating reward pathways that create this magnetic pull toward extended eye contact.



\*\*Mirroring your body language and speech patterns.\*\* This one's backed by tons of research in social psychology. When someone's attracted to you, they unconsciously synchronize with your movements, gestures, even your vocal tone and speaking pace. It's called the chameleon effect, and it stems from our primal need to build rapport with people we want to connect with. Notice if they shift their posture when you do, pick up their drink right after you do, or start using similar phrases. It's their brain literally trying to create harmony between you two.



\*\*They find excuses for physical proximity and ""accidental"" touch.\*\* Personal space is sacred, right? We typically maintain about 18 inches to 4 feet with acquaintances. But attraction makes us want to close that gap. Watch for someone who consistently positions themselves closer than necessary, finds reasons to briefly touch your arm during conversation, or ""accidentally"" brushes against you. Touch releases oxytocin (the bonding hormone), so this isn't just flirtation, it's biology driving connection.



If understanding these patterns clicks for you but you want to go deeper without spending months reading research papers, there's this app called[ BeFreed](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450) that's been genuinely useful. It's basically a personalized learning platform built by AI experts from Columbia that turns books, dating psychology research, and expert insights into custom audio content. You can tell it something like ""I'm an introvert who wants to understand attraction signals and become more magnetic in social situations,"" and it'll pull from resources like the books mentioned here plus relationship experts and studies to build you an adaptive learning plan. 



You can adjust how deep you want to go, from quick 10-minute overviews to 40-minute deep dives with real examples, and pick different voice styles (I use the smoky one because why not make learning about psychology feel less academic). Makes it way easier to actually internalize this stuff during your commute instead of just passively reading and forgetting.



\*\*Genuine smiling that reaches their eyes.\*\* There's smiling, and then there's SMILING. A Duchenne smile (named after the French neurologist who identified it) involves both the mouth AND the orbicularis oculi muscles around the eyes, creating those little crow's feet. It's nearly impossible to fake. If someone's giving you these real smiles consistently, especially when you first see each other or during random moments in conversation, that's their nervous system literally responding to your presence with joy. Paul Ekman's research on micro-expressions (the guy who inspired the show Lie to Me) demonstrates how genuine positive emotion is almost always visible in the eyes first.



\*\*They remember oddly specific details you mentioned.\*\* Like, you briefly mentioned you're trying to find good tacos in your neighborhood and three weeks later they send you a recommendation out of nowhere. Or they remember your weird coffee order, your childhood dog's name, or that random story about your coworker. This signals investment. Their brain is prioritizing information about YOU, filing it away because you matter to them. It's the reticular activating system at work, filtering information based on what we deem important.



\*\*Vocal changes when talking to you.\*\* Women's voices often become slightly higher pitched (subconsciously signaling youth/fertility from an evolutionary psych perspective, though obviously we're way beyond just biology here). Men's voices sometimes deepen (projecting strength/stability). Both might speak more softly, creating this intimate acoustic space that excludes others. Research from universities studying paralinguistics shows that vocal modulation is one of our most unconscious attraction displays.



\*\*Fidgeting or self-grooming gestures.\*\* Playing with their hair, adjusting their clothes, checking their appearance in reflective surfaces when they think you're not looking. These are displacement behaviors, anxiety responses to the nervousness that attraction creates. It's kind of endearing honestly. Their sympathetic nervous system is activated (mild fight or flight response) because you MATTER, and that creates this restless energy.



\*\*They orient their body fully toward you in group settings.\*\* Feet, torso, shoulders, all pointing your direction even when talking to others. This is called fronting in body language research. We unconsciously point toward what (or who) holds our attention and interest. It's basically their body betraying what their mind is focused on.



\*\*Asking personal questions and actually listening.\*\* Not surface level ""what do you do"" stuff, but genuine curiosity about your thoughts, feelings, experiences. They lean in when you talk, put their phone away, ask follow-up questions. Active listening is rare as hell these days, so when someone consistently does this, they're investing emotional energy into understanding you.



\*\*Finding reasons to extend your interaction time.\*\* ""Oh you're leaving? I'm heading that direction too."" Suggesting grabbing food when you mentioned being hungry. Bringing up new topics right when conversation seems to be winding down. They're essentially negotiating for more time in your presence, which is pretty much the clearest indicator that they value it.



The book \*\*The Like Switch\*\* by [Jack Schafer ](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/befreed-learn-anything/id6739747450)(former FBI behavioral analyst) breaks down attraction signals from an intelligence gathering perspective, sounds intense but it's insanely good at explaining the psychology. Also \*\*What Every BODY is Saying\*\* by Joe Navarro covers nonverbal communication in ridiculous detail.



Look, none of these are foolproof in isolation. Cultural differences, personality types, neurodivergence, all factor in. But when you see CLUSTERS of these behaviors consistently? That's when you know someone's probably into you. And honestly, the real game changer was realizing that recognizing attraction isn't about being manipulative or playing games. It's about being present enough to notice when someone's trying (often subconsciously) to show you they're interested, so you can actually respond instead of completely missing the opportunity.",1,1770987933.0,BuildToAttract,0,1.0,False

Next week I am taking my wife to NYC for a few days for her birthday. We are staying at the Pierre which is southeast of Central Park. If any of you are near this area, I would love a guide outside of AI that can tell me some favorites of yours. We love thrifting, but there are a billion stores for that, and I am having trouble sorting it all out. I was thinking about getting coffee at the Ralph Lauren coffee shop one day for example, seems kind of tourist trappy though.

  
I am also curious if anyone has ever been to the Morgan library, and if it's worth it or not. We have an evening concert in upper west Manhattan, and I am nervous traveling later at night. Is the subway still a good option around 10pm or should I plan to Uber/Taxi? Are Taxis actually just out and about most places of Manhattan for me to just reach my hand out for one? I genuinely have no idea how this works. I am from rural America. Since it's going to be winter, I'm curious how well the maintain the sidewalks as well, is it a sheet of chaotic ice out there? Are dress shoes going to be a horrible idea walking in Central Park?

$TLT $AMAT $ANET $RIVN $ROKU $BROS","Markets are lower following yesterday’s selling ahead of the inflation print. Crypto is holding above recent lows, which may be a constructive sign, though a retest remains possible if the tape deteriorates from here. TLT is attempting to break above its recent consolidation and should be watched closely.

Interesting movers:

AMAT reports Q1 EPS of $2.38, beating consensus by $0.17, with revenue down 2.1% YoY to $7.01 bln vs $6.87 bln expected.

1r3ofo1,https://lexusinternationalspa.com/,Why Bangalore Professionals Are Burning Out Faster Than Before,"Bangalore used to be called the city of dreams.  
Today, many professionals here feel exhausted, overworked and constantly tired, even on weekends.

But burnout isn’t just “feeling tired.”  
It’s a state of physical, emotional and mental fatigue that builds up over time.

Here’s why so many Bangalore professionals are feeling this way:

🧠 1. Work Culture Without Breaks

Many companies here operate long hours, tight deadlines, and heavy expectations.  
People work late, skip breaks, and rarely disconnect and the body pays the price.

📱 2. Always “On” Mode

Emails, Slack messages, and calls don’t stop after office hours.  
When your nervous system never gets time to switch off, stress becomes chronic.

☕ 3. Caffeine Doesn’t Fix Stress

Coffee gets you through the day, but it doesn’t help your body recover.  
Too much caffeine can actually increase anxiety and interrupt sleep.

😴 4. Poor Sleep Isn’t Treated as a Problem

Sleep deprivation is common, but people think it’s “normal.”  
Lack of good sleep increases cortisol (stress hormone) and makes burnout worse.

🪑 5. Sitting All Day

Desk jobs mean long hours of sitting, tight hips, neck strain and posture stress.  
This adds physical tension and pain to mental stress.

📋 6. No Recovery Time

Exercise is good, but recovery matters more.  
Without proper rest or therapeutic care, the body stays tense and fatigued.",1,1770987368.0,u_Lexusspa,0,1.0,False

Men in blue had no other choice then to stand around and watch these men ransack this place for all it had been worth. Sparing nothing as months long work would be ripped off the wall, to reveal the brickwork beneath. Every scrap removed tossed into the file boxes they once came, going so far as to use the rubbish bins besides desks once they ran out of boxes to take. Boxes stacked upon one another atop the cork board turned dolly they planned to take. One these men had been quick to lift and ferry out double doors from which none dare to bar them passage to the steps that await.

Jack had been reaching up to draw something upon the brick with what had been left of his chalk. Drawing that would never come to fruition as one of these caged men pulled it from his hand. Forced to watch as all the work he had done would be stripped from the wall. What had been the boy's mug of coffee tossed soon after to wipe away all traces of chalk and crayon alike from a quick scrub of this man's sleeve. Empty mug now placed back atop the table it had been taken from, Taking what had been left of the open files scattered across it. Squinted had been the boy's gaze upon that scrunched up face. Violent had been the shaking of his fist at the one that had come to pay him a visit. The boy about to share with him the old man's special words when pause was given with the sudden appearance of another.

""Now sport, I know you're upset you had to spend the night here, but that isn't anyway to greet your parents now, is it?"" His mother seen pushing his father aside now that she rushed into the room, Managing to hold herself back long enough to check him over for harm. No sooner had she finished, the boy found himself being squeezed so tightly within her arms it gave one little room to breath. Soft had been the  whispering of his mother's words. ""Thank god you're alright.""

""Mommy's sorry for leaving you all alone in this place, It must of been so scary to spend the night here"" The boy having his face buried within his mother's chest, Making it difficult for him to look upon the face that started to drip with rain. It had become clear the words that had been said, had been more for her own sake. Gentle had been the pat the boy now gave atop his mother's head. Being released a moment as he now watched his mother wipe away the drops of rain that stain upon her face.

Just as his mother had squeezed him, His father now did the same for her. Soft had been the words of his father. ""It'll be alright dear, He isn't harmed, just as the officer said. We can have a doctor come visit once they're able to get through the snow.""

Jack hadn't been able to hear what else had been said as words would be drowned out by slamming of an officer door, And of the slamming that would follow upon a desk that had been within. Leaving one to questioning if the loud crack that followed had been the sound of The Detective's fist breaking rather then the spot he struck upon the chief's  desk.

""You no good dirty son of a- "" Cut off by the ringing that came from within the phone Frank now slammed back down upon the hook. A call he had now been forced to cut short with The Detective's appearance. ""Sit your ass down Jack, This isn't the time or place for one of your little tirades, We've got guests.""

""This was all part of your plan wasn't it, You roll out the red carpet for those spooks you had locked up? Or they got you on a short leash like those bastards down at city hall?""

Had it been any other day Frank might of taken the bait, and gone a few rounds with The Hound barking at him from across his desk. Problem was he had no idea just who, or where these guys came from, or what reason they had come in the first place. Every call he made, no matter how high up the chain he went, Came back all the same. *Do not question, Do not hinder, Give them your full cooperation, Do not speak further of this matter.*

""This isn't the frontier Jack, Something you should of learned by now. Times have changed and we've been given our orders by the powers that be.""

Frank had taken the moment to try and light a cigar pulled from the wooden box atop his desk. The type Jack would only ever get a chance to smoke on a special occasion. One That'd be slapped from his hand now that The Detective had his finger pointed in his face.

""What about all those good men we've lost? Jones, Woods, Hank, and that kid I didn't even get a chance to ask!""

Frank standing up from behind his desk, With how quick, and close he had been to Jack's face, it was a question how he hadn't cracked his skull against his. Keeping his voice low, trying his best to keep his cool. ""Hank's been dead for years Jack, Or you knock back one too many to even remember that?"" 

""I know what I saw damnit, Why w- ""

Jack having taken hold of Frank by the collar of his shirt, Silence hitting the place a moment the office door had been forced open. To catch a glimpse of his own reflection upon the shades these two men dressed in similar fashion as The Detective . One left Swearing up a storm at their arrival, One that couldn't be silenced behind a door left to close a moment later. The boy glanced over at his father, whom seemed to have been staring at those that had just entered the office. His father only stopped watching once one of them had taken notice, and closed the shutters to the adjacent window.

""Wonder if those are to be dad's replacement, Maybe they'll stop calling him so he can enjoy his retirement.""

""Oh wouldn't that be wonderful, Maybe now we can go camping like we use to, Or maybe take a trip back home."" His mother having returned to her usual chipper self, attention drawing towards the squeaking of rubber now that Jack had been trying to pull on one of his gumboots. ""Wouldn't that be fun sweetie? To go camping out in the woods?""

That blank expression their son gave them had said more in that moment then a thousand words, Shame neither of them knew how to read it. That awkward silence that came within that moment brief, having been cut short by a door being thrown open. Detective heard yelling to the point it left one's ears ringing as words echoed off the office walls.

""You bastards are all the same, Five good men killed, and you want me to act like it never happened!?""

""We only have one confirmed dead, and the other two missing, Detective."" One of these men in grey would say. ""

We've humored you long enough by listening to these tall tales of monsters."" Man holding the notepad spoke. Question if he even bothered to write down what had been said.

""God damnit Frank!, You aren't listening! I'm telling you I saw Hank! Him and the others all dead from whatever that thing is lying in that basement!""

The other man taking a turn to speak now. ""We've already checked the basement of that old speak easy, All we found was an old dumping ground. Something you missed during your time dealing with the mob by the looks of it."" 

 The one standing beside the man speaking flipping through the pages of his note pad a moment, before asking a question of his own. ""Plates came back on the vehicle driven through the store front, Care to explain why you did it Detective? Or are you still going to claim it was this Williams character we aren't even certain exists at this point?""

The chief  had been watching from behind his desk now that the other two had turned to questioning The Detective, Clear he didn't like the direction the questioning had been going. Jack having been trying to make his way back towards his desk now that Frank decided to yell out to the officers that had been ordered to stand by. ""Men, If he isn't out of here in five minutes, I want you to drag him out. You're no longer welcome here Jack.""

The Detective had been looking through his desk, for anything that might take off the edge of his anger that had been reaching a boiling point now that they started to question his sanity, even worse to question the validity of his words. A smoke, A Drink, anything would  of been enough at this point. Even a cup of two month old sludge at the bottom of that pot, had the kid not already drank it all. Last thing he needed was these spooks hounding him, and barking orders.

""Hang up your coat Detective, and we'll extend you one last curtesy of overlooking all your involvement up to this point.""

 One of these men now moving to try and block The detective's way as had been reaching to pull open a bottom drawer of his desk. One left to wonder if it had been a haphazard attempt to get him to pay attention.

""Neither of us know why you've been given this chance, Despite our differences, I advise you take it.""

Question if The Detective had even been listening to the two speak now, as he glanced towards one of the officers. ""Got any spuds on you?""

Officer having been looking towards Frank for permission, as the man in grey holding the notepad decided to stand between the two of them.  ""Take a good, hard look over at that family of yours right over there, Be a real shame if you end up throwing all that way.""

If one had blinked, they'd of missed it. One moment The Detective had been fishing around for his lighter in his pocket, The next he'd knocked the glasses right off the man in grey's face. Struck him hard enough he'd of broken his hand, had it not been for his flip lighter he'd been squeezing.

""Even think about harming a hair on their heads, And I promise I'll hunt down every last one of you to the ends of the earth if I have to."" Words that had been said with an eerie calmness from The Detective.

 Such words left Frank alarmed now, Yelling from his office. ""What are you all doing standing around for, Get him the hell out of here!""

Man nearly knocked on his ass, reaching for something beneath his coat, only to be stopped by the other that had been standing beside him. Not given a chance to speak as the one that pulled him back upon his feet would do the talking for the both of them.

""You've been given your chance detective, Enjoy that fairy tale ending you deserve while you still can, Before it turns into a grim one.""

Officer that had been reaching for his pack of smokes, reaching for his billy club instead. ""I'd rather you not make me use this Sir, Not after the night we've been through""

""Their is no need for that officer, My father was just leaving. Weren't you dad?"" The Detective glanced over at his son that had placed a hand on his shoulder, knocking it away. ""Ya, Ya, I'm going. Least I won't be around when all hell breaks loose.""

The Detective having nearly made his way out the door when he'd pause, to yell back. ""Promise me this Frank, you'll be the one to personally tell all thirty two of those families they're up shit creek because you rather play grab ass with these goons.""

Frank staring passed the man in grey that had been stepping into his office. Look he gave Jack having been one of pity and exhaustion. The other man in grey having been collecting his shades, when he found himself face to face with the boy that had been standing so close it was a question how he hadn't bumped heads with him. Like a deer caught in the headlights the moment their eyes had met. Just how this boy had managed to get that close without him even knowing had left him rattled. Even if his expression didn't show it, his eyes had said all that was needed in that moment.

""Mind taking a step back kid, You're standing on my. . . "" The boy having been offering up the glasses he'd been reaching for. ""Glasses.""

""Thanks kid."" Shades placed back on his face, Yet something about that boy's look he couldn't shake. Something about it left him feeling watched, even now that his mother had come to lead him away by the hand. ""Come on sweetie, Let's get you home and something to eat, You must be starving.""

The sun couldn't of been up for more then a few hours at this point, Yet it had managed to melt away half the snow. What had been left was being cleared by those men once wielding hammers, now wielding shovels instead. Clearing away enough so the plow could finish paving the way.

The Detective having already gone, as his father would be a ways down the street, having parked along the curb that had been cleared up to that point. Having been busy trying to get the car to start with each and every rotation of the crank shaft at hand.

""I'm worried about your father, Can't remember the last time I've seen him that worked up, Can't believe he struck that man."" Having been busy lifting the boy up and upon the seat.

""He just needs a bit of time to clear his head, Once he returns home this evening it'll be like nothing ever happened, you'll see."" Crank shaft being placed upon the back of the car.

Jack having been reaching for that dial that would awaken the talking thing in the box, only to have his mother take hold of his hand. ""You'll have to wait till we get home dear, Your father is busy thinking.""

Sun had been starting to set by time they managed to crawl their way through the snow, A quiet trip broken by the huffing of a certain grumpy beast that had been sitting opposite of the car door the boy pushed open. Seemed Rex had been in no mood for their usual game of stare, or game of tag. Seemed the boy would be forced to partake in a new game of drag now that the canine took hold of him by the back of the coat. 

His mother having been watching this. ""Isn't that just the most adorable thing you've ever seen, Looks like we weren't the only ones worried sick."" 

""Well Isn't that just the darnest thing you've ever seen."" His father having been more focused on what was left of the front door. Rex having clawed and chewed his way through in the time they'd gone to retrieve their son. ""Need to see if I can get this fixed before dad shows up.""

""Swear I saw the basement door lying around here some where, Don't think he'll have any need for it.""

Sounds of a hammer heard as the frame of the door was being pounded back into place. Sound of his mother sweeping up the mess in the kitchen that came from shaking out the pockets of her son's overalls. Having no idea where he managed to get his hands on what looked to be flour. 

Rex sitting on his hunches, Sniffing at the boy standing beside him, one that now smelled of wild flowers. One left staring down at this thing called coco he'd been given by his mother. To stare at those fluffy treats floating upon the surface. Slurping heard a moment now that his attention had turned towards the large box they had been standing in front of. One that had taken the place of that which he was not allowed to feed.

Slow had been a small hand to extend towards one of the dials that had been placed beneath a window no larger then a ruler. That buzzing hum that came the moment the boy gave it a twist to awaken what looked to be a tiny man sitting behind a desk. One that had been eager to share things with him just as the talking box once had. 

📺 *Folks I come to you today with a heavy heart, We'll be starting the new year without The Hound patrolling our*

Clicking heard with static as the boy continued to slowly twist the dial before him. A new face appearing behind a desk.

📺 *While everyone was tucked in enjoy the warmth of a fire, One man had been out putting an end to a reign of terror. That's right ladies and gentleman, The hound has-*

Another appearing, this time standing with a cigar in hand. as the boy would twist further.

📺 *I don't know about you listeners, But I'll be able to sleep sound tonight knowing we can finally put this Hunter business behind us. Good rid-*

""Think I've heard enough of all this hunter business for one day, How about we find you something better to watch."" His mother having taken control of the dial now, taking a moment to twist through several faces.

📺 *We return to another heart pounding adventure of. . .* 

""Here we are sweetie, now be a good boy for mommy and watch your show while I finish preparing supper."" 

Plopping down in front of the tv now, Jack left to lay back against the canine that had been laying on his side behind him. For once this gluttonous beast had taken interest in something other then food now that he watch the one barking through the window with his name sake. Barking drowned out by the occasional slurping of coco.

The one dude said that we don’t even have the technology anymore to land and what not. This isn’t the first time I’ve heard someone state this but it’s beyond obvious we do. 

My understanding is the reason why we never landed on the moon since is the same reason why the Apollo project/missions ended. Financial, correct? From what I read, the Apollo missions were in the tune of over $300 billion+ in today’s money. 

I was researching further and from what I gathered, while the Saturn V rocket was an  I N C R E D I B L E  piece of engineering, the Artemis II is way more efficient. So we have progressed, and we should still have the capability to land in a more efficient and sound way, right?

My mom has this thing where she monitors what I spend money on and makes passive aggressive comments about how I’m“wasteful or spoiled whenever I buy something for myself. Could be a HK$20 shirt. Could be coffee. Doesn’t matter.
But here’s the kicker. She orders massive amounts of random stuff online that just sits in our garage unused. Last month she bought 80 kitchen towels because she found some deal about HK$60 off every HK$600 spent and decided that was her mission. We’re a family of four. We do not need 80 towels. She’s constantly browsing wholesale sites like marks and spencer, alibaba and fortress, looking for deals on things we don’t need. Plastic containers. Cheap gadgets. Fake plants. She justifies it by saying she’s being smart with money and getting bulk pricing.
Meanwhile I saved up from my part time job to buy a decent pair of headphones for school and she gave me a 20 minute lecture about how I don’t appreciate money and how she worked so hard to give me everything.
The hypocrisy is insane. She hoards junk but I’m the irresponsible one for buying something I’ll actually use. I can’t even argue with her because she’ll turn it into how disrespectful I am and how I don’t understand her sacrifices.

It took 7 months for me to get a job here that didn’t end up working out, so I thought it was hopeless. We weren’t willing to wait that indefinite amount of time again. Especially because I can only work for English speaking employers and my job relies heavily on knowing local employment laws and regulations. I was so defeated, even coffee shops wouldn’t take me, and the morning I got this offer I got a rejection from Sephora to sell makeup. Lol.

The offer I got is from an employer I’ve been applying to since before moving here Oct 2024. I interviewed with them last May and they tried to offer me something not in my field directly so I ended up getting ghosted. Well, continuous applying to the same job I wanted I got an invite out of the blue 3 weeks ago from the last time I applied in December.

I made sure to mention ‘as you can see, I’ve wanted to work with you since even before I moved here and I kept you in the loop on my other interview status because I knew this place was the best fit for me’. She appreciated the perseverance and said timing is everything and it’s great it worked out.

My advice would be: keep applying for those roles you see that keep getting re-posted, and if you hear back (or follow-up after a few applications) your case for your passion wanting to work there will be stronger I think.

Otherwise, hang in there. Going through job loss again only 5 months later got me to the darkest, scariest place I’ve been mentally. The process is so freaking bleak - being able to act chipper and enthusiastic after constant radio silence and rejections takes a special kind of resilience. I felt pathetic cold-messaging and grovelling on LI (btw premium did squat for me so I’m cancelling right after this post).

If you’ve made it this far.. thanks for listening. It really does come out of the blue when it does, and it does take pure persistence during that time.

I also wrote custom cover letters & resumes for each job - I have a master spreadsheet for resumes and as for cover letters, frankensteined them from past ones I’ve written with common themes. Happy to share.

Something was off with the world and the government knew. Somehow I got roped into helping them out as a test dummy/interpreter because my dreams could project me forward as far forward or far back as needed. But Something was wrong. No matter what we did. No matter how many calculations were done. Time was always coming to an end in 3 years time in my dream. There was something existentially frightening and harrowing on an eldritch level to see reality itself fade into an infinite nothingness. We thought technology would save us. So they used me and a woman as a test dummies again and we were sent to this pocket dimension. It contained a desert like realm with mountains and several buildings where we resided. We took main shelter in what looked kind of like an office/ drive through coffee shop. because it had the most supplies and food. But we quickly realized it didnt even matter. Becuase we were stuck in a strange time loop. everyday everything reset except our minds and so this went on for years. 

somehow we eventually made it out or were pulled out. They had figured out the equations. On how to save the universe. but it was to late. Right then and there the whole world starts fritzing out and we brace for unimaginable pain. 

but as that wave of nothingness hits us it was like for a .moment all timeliness coverged for a moment and we experienced and infinite outcome of what the end of the world looked and felt like for a of us. I felt horror, I felt peace, I felt pain. I felt nothing. and then after that true nothing. I was just simply apart of the void now. ceasing to ever have existed.

Hi guys, i am an 18 year old guy, currently in my 1st year of college and working part time as a coffee shop cashier. I really tired of this addiction, yet it's so hard to stop. i was exposed to porn when i was 13, and yeah i really hate it, even when i am in the middle of masterbation or self pleasure, i am still not enjoying that stuff, in fact I regret watching porn at the young age, after watch pornography, or even post masterbation. 

today I am an 18 year old guy who still struggle those, maybe i don't have an improvement of getting rid of my addiction, i tried myself watching self help videos on YouTube or TikTok or any social media apps available, i even go to the gym every 3 to 4 a week, 2 year trainee, yet it still not enough, still depressed, not severe but more, introverted guy, and yes still hard to be social, even struggle to look other woman, it's like having a phobia on women. 

I really hate watching pornography but idk why i watch those stuff, it's like a routine every night at 8 pm or 10 pm. I really hate drinking alcohol, smoking or even hates soda drinks, i know it's a weird flex, but looking at women online? still my only struggle. Today I relapsed again after watching pornography for a week, and for me it's not enough.

You might be hearing this for the first time, but I hadn't heard it either before I started working in this field. For the past two years of my life, **I worked as an idea validation consultant.** Let me briefly explain what that is. Companies and startups would come to us before launching a new product or pivoting - either on their own initiative or because their investors pushed them to and we'd help them with their next steps and product validation process. I'm going to share the framework and tech stack that'll answer all these posts once and for all and close this topic forever.

1. Think without limits If you want to generate ideas, you need to lock yourself in a room with the people you're brainstorming with (or by yourself) and think without boundaries. You have to accept that there's no such thing as a stupid or meaningless idea. Use **Miro**
2. Organize your ideas in the clearest and simplest way possible List out the ideas you've developed through limitless thinking and for the first 3 or 5 (up to you), find ways to explain your idea in the clearest and simplest way and make it presentable. Could be a one-pager, could be a landing page, or something else - totally up to you. Use [**Landwait.com**](http://landwait.com/)
3. Distribute as much as you can Talk about your idea everywhere without shame or fear. While having coffee with someone, on relevant subreddits on Reddit, on X. Pay attention to this: ""I have this idea, would you use it?"" is absolutely forbidden. If you've clearly defined the problem your product solves, write discovery questions that can help you understand if they're experiencing that problem. Directly asking ""Do you have this problem?"" is also forbidden. If you ask everyone the same questions, you'll get consistent results. Use **Google Docs**
4. Analyze the results How many people came to your landing page? Beyond how many people came, how long did it take you to reach that number (time-to-value)? What's the pattern in the answers to the questions I asked? Evaluate both qualitative and quantitative data together. You can use AI to analyze qualitative data and look for patterns. Us**e Google Sheets and ChatGPT, Gemini etc.**

And that's it. In the end, interpreting the results is critical and that's on you. You're the one who's going to dedicate your life to this. When evaluating the results here, you need to pay attention to two things, and actually, idea validation is done to answer these two questions:

1. **How many people are experiencing the problem my product solves? (Waitlist count)**
2. **How important is this problem to them? (Answers you get from your interviews)**
