1mnxl7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueChristian/comments/1mnxl7u/found_a_cool_youtuber_but_i_dont_think_i_should/,Found a cool youtuber but i dont think i should watch their content anymore,"I've been praying to God alot to not judge any christian influencer at all, so today I found one I was going to give a chance and her name is Ashley Hetherington and I thought, ""hm even though she looks the same as everyone else I'll give her a try"" so I watched her video about being a woman of Proverbs 31 and she did a good job honestly and I was happy to watch her videos, until I went to watch her shorts (https://youtube.com/shorts/qgcDsfvxvpA?si=7KdRiaiT_HmR19l0) now this link is about a youtube short about a morning routine as a Christian girl with timestamps, the video made me question things


1. At 5:00, why does she have a cup of water by her bed? I don't think Stanley cups have little closings so what happens if she got a bug in her drink? (This part took until 5:05, therefore 5 minutes)

2. At 5:05, I get brushing your teeth when you get up but shouldn't you read the bible or pray first? She also did her skincare routine and did that annoying tapping with the bottles (to mention the title on the video says asmr) and she brushed her hair (this took 15 minutes which is a bit long)

3. At 5:20 she made herself a aesthetic coffee which took 10 minutes, now it's good to have a drink by you when you read the bible and to study it for awhile but this should have been first like praying

4. At 5:30 she finally reads the bible and studies it and it took 20 minutes, now I'm trying to be back into God but if you are in the stage of highlighting the bible and studying then it should take 30+ minutes, if you are new christian you should read bible for 10 or 20 minutes but if you want to step up your life with God then do 30 minutes 

5. At 5:50 she's picking out clothes to wear thankfully she did a transition so we don't see her privates there is no problem with this part(this took 10 minutes)

6. At 6:00 she does more skincare? I know we want our skin to glow more and to be healthy but why wouldn't you do this earlier? She also has that skincare headband that's trendy, why not tie your hair in a bun or put clips in it so it won't get in your hair? (This took 15 minutes like on No.2)

7. At 6:15 she brushed her hair again even though it was fine, she grabbed her laptop and headphones indicating she's heading out to maybe study? (This took 15 minutes)

And at 6:30 she went out

In the comments (if you sort by newest and scroll down until a year) they will call her out about some of the points I've recorded in here, and she would respond with ""glad your watching"" by most instead of telling them why she does the routine. From this video she took 20 minutes with God while the rest of time altogether was 70 minutes or 1 hour and 10 minutes! If anything you should put God first and spend much time with Him instead of spending and hour and 10 looking good and making coffee. Should I watch her? Or no?",1,1754968098.0,TrueChristian,0,1.0,False

1mnxkb1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1mnxkb1/felt_like_a_soulmate/,Felt like a soulmate,"For reference, we had a 2 week fling, no contact for 3 months, then she texts asking if i wanted to fuck‚Ä¶my answer might surprise you

approached a girl in the school cafeteria, got her number

had a coffee date, i told her im good at cooking and would cook for her one of these days, she said she wanted to come over that night

for the first time ever, i couldnt get hard for her, even tho she was a 10, athletic, small, and we connected over music and some niche topic

i think part of it was i thought she was the woman i was always looking for, part of me wanted to perform well for her, but i had drank a bit the night before

in spite of this, we kept hooking up, in which i was able to perform those next times

anyways, she left after two weeks, abrupt and over text

it was the loverboy in me, was devastted, the woman i wanted who had everything i could hope for, left me high and dry, i went into a 3 month rot, didnt try in school, not eating some days, overindulgence in substances 

i would see her occasionally with a few other guys, that hurt when i would see her laughing and walking with him,

after those 3 months, she texts asking if i wanted to fuck before end of school.

i had her over for dinner that we made together, and when it was time to fuck, she was kissing and rubbing on me, but i kept my composure and took her for a drive

we came back, she starts again, i told her not tonight, and she stayed over

a few days later, i took her on a nice day out, in part to show her who i was, in part to contrast the purely physical relationship we had with emotional bonding

i really tried, we went to a museum, arcade, food, and thrift store, she said she had fun

later that night, she tried again to get laid, i said no, not if you would leave again like she did, she said she didnt know i was that type of guy

this led to a nice heart to heart (i feel like) 

we talked about childhood, she asked me questions like what i thought her original intentions were, what i was afraid of, why did i think she left like that

one moment ill never forget is when we are dancing, she hops on me and hangs backwards with her legs wrapped around me, she started to fall, so i grabbed her and lifted her onto the bed‚Ä¶the look she gave me, i dont know how to describe it but ill never forget her eyes looking at me, almost like disbelief, safety, she liked it

anyways, after that night, shes leaving in the morning and i gave her a gift of one of my posters of a band she mentioned she liked when she saw it, when she left out the door, i said dont be a stranger, and she winked at me

3 days later, she texts me asking to go camping, she says she‚Äôll check her schedule‚Ä¶never heard from her again

i dont know man, i feel like we connected so well, better than any of the women ive been with, and when i start drinking, i wonder if she feels a pull, a twang, an inkling of what i felt for her

Ask me questions and ill answer

1mnxjpm,https://www.reddit.com/r/fearofflying/comments/1mnxjpm/my_recent_positive_experience/,my recent positive experience,"just want to share my recent positive experience. long time lurker here. I saved the best advice I saw (or advice I liked the most) and applied it to a recent round trip cross country flight. 

background: nervous flyer since I was a teenager, flown 50+ times, doomsday thinking every time, dreading the countdown to the day of a flight, usually have a hard time sleeping the night before, liquor up pre flight, sweated profusely throughout the flight but powered through. 

recently flew US cross country round trip (5+ hours each way) and had the most positive experience flying that I can remember since I was a child (before I was too grown up to work myself up over flying).

advice that worked for me:
1. binging on a tv show/movies absolutely is a hack. I love Ken Burns documentaries (and they are long). watched a few parts of an especially long one and was successfully distracted. also watched one of my favorite TV shows on the flight back. 
2. lifting your feat during turbulence really does work. I‚Äôm pretty sure everyone reading this is aware. but it deserves to be emphasized. 
3. eating well the day before helped my usual stomach nerves. I would be the guy nervously farting on the plane (yeah that guy) and I swear I did not pass gas once on either flight. had a salad before the flight out and a high quality steak before the flight back. pre-flight/during I ate little to nothing (Rx bar, nuts) and drank only water. also avoided coffee, both flights were super early morning and I love coffee in the morning. 
4. simply did not allow myself to think of my impending doom. positive mindset only. 
5. was disciplined both nights before an early morning flight and scheduled a bedtime, stopped watching TV/staring at phone and avoided bad eating/drinking. 

I did not consume any alcohol prior to either flight, though I will say lorazepam helps me immensely and is a much better substitute. I take 1mg about 2-3 hours pre flight. I do not otherwise use this drug daily, hence the relatively low dosage. also I find that this drug has more of a ‚Äúramp‚Äù effect and it helps to slowly dose up starting the night before (0.5mg). it helps me sleep too. yes it still alters you but lorazepam at low doses sure seems like a much better alternative to alcohol. the after effects for me are minimal and I feel completely normal when consuming, just much, much more relaxed. 

Hoping for many more flights like these and I sincerely hope this helps someone. ",1,1754967976.0,fearofflying,1,1.0,False
1mnxizw,https://www.reddit.com/r/McBeeDynasty/comments/1mnxizw/mcbree_boys_with_steve_sr_in_nashville_steve_jr/,McBree boys with Steve Sr. in Nashville.  Steve Jr seems way too gleeful having his brothers going with him on a ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù asks party trip.,"Steve Jr. is intentionally trying to stir the pot between his brothers and their girlfriend and fianc√©.  I think he resents Kaycee getting pregnant and Jesse getting married.  
Steve Jr knows exactly what he is doing.  Knowing his father was showing up and he just happened to NOT tell anyone?  He is becoming more and more a snake in my opinion.  He is being performative for the cameras like when he raises his voice to Callah and grips his fingers together.  
They also knew Galyna was showing up and they left and ‚Äúempty‚Äù chair right next to Steve Sr.?  Oh come on now.  They also said Marsha was planning on going so did they tell Galyna or the girls‚Ä¶ probably it NOT!  The disrespect he shows for women is discussing and I see his father in him more and more after every episode.
I will say, I love that Mama McBee admits the boys behavior is unacceptable and appears to support the girls.  The fact that his mom walked out of the coffee shop on him says a lot!  He spoke to Calah the same way!!  Steve Jr. is acting like a man child and is beyond selfish!  Calah was smart to leave, I hope she doesn‚Äôt get sucked back in!

It all started with my first big assignment: a 5,000-word paper on environmental sustainability in the Great Barrier Reef. Deadline? Two weeks. Procrastination level? Expert. Instead of hitting the books right away, I decided to ""immerse"" myself in the topic. Hopping on a train to Cairns, I traded my laptop for a snorkel mask. Diving into those turquoise waters, surrounded by clownfish darting like hyperactive commas and turtles gliding like wise old professors, I felt the reef's pulse. But intrigue struck when a sudden storm rolled in‚Äîwaves crashing, visibility zero. Stranded on a boat with marine biologists, I grilled them for hours about coral bleaching and climate impacts. Their stories? Goldmine. Back on land, soaked and exhilarated, I wove those real-life tales into my paper, turning dry facts into a narrative that hooked my lecturer like a marlin on a line.
Fast-forward to mid-semester madness: a group project on Indigenous Australian history. My teammates? A mix of locals and fellow expats, all scattered across Melbourne's laneways.

That night, inspiration struck: We framed our project as a ""living timeline,"" blending oral histories with digital maps. Submitted just in time, it earned us top marks and a nod from the uni's cultural center. Who knew dodging kangaroos on dirt roads could lead to academic glory?
But the real thriller came during finals week‚Äîa thesis on urban wildlife in Perth. Sleepless nights loomed, coffee IV drip engaged. Then, plot twist: A quokka invasion! These smiling marsupials, famous from Rottnest Island, somehow became my muse. I cycled out at dawn, camera in hand, observing how they adapted to city life amid eucalyptus groves.

Through it all, Australia's wild spirit taught me the secret: Assignments aren't just words on a page; they're quests.

My parents helped me rent a small apartment near campus,luckily I won‚Äôt have to share a bathroom with anyone. They‚Äôve been really supportive and helped set up the place with all the furniture and appliances.



I‚Äôve been working at a coffee shop for almost 8 months, and here‚Äôs the list of gifts I got myself to celebrate:



Invisalign ‚Äì This basically took all my savings (and yes, my parents helped too). I‚Äôve always felt a bit insecure about my teeth,I had an overbite and never liked how I looked when I smiled. I thought about getting metal braces, but I really didn‚Äôt want to start college with a bunch of wires in my mouth, so I went with Invisalign



Soocas electric toothbrush and Zima Dental‚Äôs ultrasonic cleaner‚Äì¬† My dentist told me it‚Äôs super important to floss or use a water flosser. I found this Soocas one on Amazon that‚Äôs a toothbrush and water flosser in one, so it saved me from buying two separate things



Lululemon Double Zip Backpack 22L ‚Äì I used to use the Adidas Wonder Blue. Honestly, even though the Lululemon one is smaller on paper, it somehow holds more. I got the raw linen color and love how the compartments are set up. I keep my iPad in the laptop sleeve, lunch and daily stuff in the main part, a pouch of hygiene stuff in the front pocket, and my ADHD meds plus power bank in the top pocket. My favorite part? The stretchy mesh side pockets,one fits my water bottle, the other holds my umbrella. Super handy



Stanley THE ICEFLOW ‚Äî I ended up leaving with the Prickly Pear iceflow (which has the new lid/spout thankfully). Love that the accent on prickly pear is actually an olive color (originally it looked black or navy). And Petrol is a really pretty smokey blue in person‚Ä¶

1mnxf0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/OutdoorAus/comments/1mnxf0p/outdoor_entertaining_area_landscaping_ideas_for/,Outdoor Entertaining Area Landscaping Ideas for Perth Homes,"There‚Äôs something special about creating¬†*beautiful spaces where family and friends can gather, laugh and relax.*¬†[**Outdoor landscaping Perth**](https://www.lookinggood.net.au/landscaping/landscape-design/)¬†gives homeowners the chance to design backyard areas that truly fit the local lifestyle. With the right features and thoughtful planning, you can build a garden that‚Äôs perfect for everything from weekend BBQs to cosy winter nights around the fire.

Let‚Äôs explore some creative landscaping ideas that can help you design the ultimate outdoor entertaining space.

# Why Outdoor Entertaining Matters In Perth

# Embracing The Perth Lifestyle

Perth is made for outdoor living. Think¬†*warm, summer days, family BBQs sizzling in the background and weekends that roll effortlessly from day to night.*¬†This is what Perth¬†[backyard design](https://www.lookinggood.net.au/landscaping/residential/)¬†is all about: creating spaces that feel easy, welcoming and part of your everyday life. Whether it‚Äôs a¬†*quick coffee on the patio*¬†or¬†*a full garden party with friends,*¬†a good outdoor space brings the Perth lifestyle home.

# Maximising Outdoor Living Year-round

Outdoor living spaces Perth are not just for summer. Imagine¬†*cool mornings with coffee under a shaded pergola, lazy afternoon BBQs and winter nights spent around the soft crackle of a fire pit.*¬†Perth‚Äôs climate makes it possible to enjoy your garden through every season. With the right design, you can balance shade, breeze and sunlight to keep your backyard comfortable all year round

# Design Considerations for Entertaining Spaces

# Traffic Flow, Zoning and Privacy

*The best outdoor spaces feel open,*¬†but they work because they‚Äôre well-planned*.*¬†It‚Äôs all about how people move through your garden. Make sure there‚Äôs a natural flow between alfresco zones, outdoor kitchens and seating areas so guests can wander comfortably.

Use low hedges, screening plants, timber panels or decorative garden walls to create privacy while still keeping the space light and connected.¬†*A few well-placed screens can make the whole backyard feel more intimate and relaxed.*

# Blending Function with Aesthetics

[**Beautiful backyards work**](https://www.lookinggood.net.au/projects/)¬†hard behind the scenes. It‚Äôs the little things¬†*‚Äì the feel of solid paving underfoot, the soft touch of flowering plants nearby, the way feature lighting gently pulls everything together.*

Built-in seating, smart storage and easy-care surfaces all make outdoor entertaining smoother, but they should also look great. Balance durable materials with lush greenery and textured finishes to create a space that‚Äôs both practical and¬†*a joy to spend time in.*

# Must-Have Features For A Great Entertaining Area

# Decks, Pergolas and Alfresco Structures

Covered decks, pergolas and alfresco area landscaping Perth bring the whole space together. They give your entertaining area structure, shade and a natural place to gather. Picture¬†*soft festoon lights strung overhead, sheer curtains catching the breeze and climbing plants wrapping gently around the posts.*¬†These touches turn a simple pergola into a warm, welcoming retreat**.**

# Outdoor Kitchens, Bars and BBQ Setups

A well-planned¬†**outdoor kitchen garden design**¬†is a must for Perth homes that love to entertain. When your kitchen flows into the garden, cooking, serving and socialising all come together in one easy space.

Include built-in bench space, storage for BBQ gear and a quality cooking setup that‚Äôs made for the Perth lifestyle. Add a compact bar or a wine fridge to¬†*keep drinks close and the conversation going.*¬†Outdoor landscaping Perth is about creating these effortless connections, where every part of your backyard works beautifully together**.**

# Fire Pits and Heating for Winter Gatherings

A fire pit quickly becomes the heart of your garden. Firepit landscaping brings warmth, style and a place to gather when the¬†**nights get cool.**¬†Imagine¬†*the sound of crackling firewood, the warmth on your face and the glow lighting up your backyard as your family toasts marshmallows under the stars.*

Type 1 diabetic, living with thrombocytopenia since 36, both conditions under control. Take daily insulin injections for diabetes. No medications for the thrombocytopenia, just monthly blood tests to check platelet levels - when platelets become too low I do prednisone therapy. Except for the insulin injections, I take no medicine regularly, however I take daily vitamin D and magnesium supplements.

I live a sedentary lifestyle, don't go to gyms or exercise (though I do a relative good amount of walking and up/down stairs every day), and I work in IT so I spend most of the day sitting in a chair. I don't drink alcohol, never did drugs, mostly drink water (I always make sure to drink plenty of water every day to stay hydrated, since in the past I've ended up in the ER once for dehydration and it was entirely my fault), and I mostly eat homemade meals - junk food and fast food are not part of my daily diet. However I drink lots of coffee (black, sugar-free) and I've been a smoker for 22 years - would love to quit but I'm addicted. I was smoking nearly 1 pack every day for the last 4 years, but since about a year ago I managed to get it down to around 7 to 10 cigs per day. So smoking, sedentarism and too much coffee are my bad habits.

Now, about my current issues and the reason I'm writing this post. Since 5 days ago, I started feeling a dull, intense pain on my right groin, that often irradiates down to the front of my right thigh, or less often, to the side of my right buttock. The pains become a lot worse when there's no physical activity, i.e. about after 1 - 2 hours laying down in bed or sitting, and the pains gradually slowly subside (sometimes disappearing completely) with any kind of physical activity, like walking, doing squats, or doing a few physical therapy and decompression exercises I've seen on YT and my father taught me (since he's been living with sciatic pain for many years). The worst moments are when I go to bed to sleep. I'm often waking up in the middle of night with terrible pain, and have to change positions to alleviate the pain.

When it's time to get up, sometimes I'm barely able to get up and walk since the right leg hurts terribly and feels completely sore, stiff and numb, and I start walking on a limp. However as I get up and keep moving, walking to do my morning chores and prepare for the day, do some stretching exercises, squats and decompression exercises, the pains slowly subside and either the pain and soreness are still there but become tolerable enough for me to walk and go through the day normally, or sometimes they disappear completely if I'm lucky (until I spend some time sitting or laying down). I noticed I'm also currently unable to cross my right leg over my left leg, the ligaments and articulations just feel completely stiff and feel as if something's going to break if I force the move.

Since yesterday, I first tried taking ibuprofen to make the pains more tolerable, but it doesn't seem to have helped at all. Then I tried dypirone/metamizole (it's legal and sold over the counter where I live), and it's helping a lot.

I have no previous medical history of back problems, joint or muscular issues. So, in this subReddit opinion, what's the most likely diagnosis for this. I've read a lot about sciatic nerve issues and piriform issues, but also more serious things like lymph nodes, hernias or tumors, abdominal problems, osteoarthritis or other form of articular degeneration that got me concerned. I checked and pressed the entire affected region especially around the groin, and didn't notice anything abnormal like bumps, spots or hardness. What I find strange in my case, is that most articles on the web and YT videos say that in most of these issues the pains often become worse with movement or exercise, which is the opposite of what I'm having.

I don't know if there might be a correlation, but before these symptoms showed up, last month I was treated for a severe flu with symptoms that lasted nearly 3 weeks, including fevers up to 38.5 celsius, extremely sore and inflammed throat, lots of coughing with thick mucus, and chest pains. Prescribed treatment included azithromycin and loratadine pills, budesonide nasal spray, and ambroxol syrup, all for 7 days. I made a full recovery. Just the following day after I felt I was fully recovered from this flu, I started feeling the groin and thigh pains. Can't have an effin' break!

In the included image, I try to illustrate the areas where the pain is located. In green is the main pain source in the right groin, and in blue the areas the pain irradiates to, in the right thigh and buttock. Can anyone help with opinions and ideas? Thanks!

Chapter 1 - A Bouquet of Betrayal and Cold Roses

On their third wedding anniversary, Skye Marshall nearly died from massive blood loss during surgery.

Her husband, Maximilian Foster, sent her a bouquet of white roses.

His first love, Ariyah Fox, stood there with teary eyes, apologizing.

""Ms. Marshall, I'm so sorry. I mixed up the flower colors. Please don‚Äôt take it out on Max, okay?""

Maximilian pulled her into a tender embrace, murmuring reassurances, leaving Skye with only a cold remark.

""You‚Äôre blowing this out of proportion. Keep it up, and we might as well call it quits.""

Skye let go, ready to walk away.

But he refused to sign the papers.

------

Maximilian pushed the door open.

Fresh from his trip, he instinctively held out his arms, expecting Skye to step forward and help him with his tie and coat.

She barely glanced at him, staying seated on the couch, eyes fixed on the TV.

His brows furrowed slightly, but he said nothing, tossing his tie and coat onto the sofa before sitting across from her.

His silk shirt was casually unbuttoned at the collar, long legs crossed‚Äîstill relaxed, as if nothing had ever happened between them.

He reached for the cup on the table out of habit.

But this time, there was no warm coffee waiting for him, no carefully arranged cheese platter.

His frown deepened.

""I‚Äôm starving.""

Skye didn‚Äôt look up. ""There‚Äôs frozen pizza in the freezer.""

He exhaled sharply, forcing a smile as he placed a brand-new designer bag in front of her.

""Last week, Ariyah genuinely made a mistake with the roses. It was just a mix-up.""

""But she‚Äôs young. Cut her some slack. This is my way of making it up to you‚Äîfor her sake.""

Maximilian was always busy.

His secretary handled most of life‚Äôs mundane tasks‚Äîalways male, to put Skye at ease.

In the past, when he messed up and upset her, he‚Äôd pull her close, lips brushing her ear, begging like a puppy for forgiveness.

He‚Äôd take her out himself to pick a gift.

But ever since Ariyah returned, every present he gave Skye was chosen by someone else‚Äîfrom the white roses on their anniversary to this bag. All half-hearted gestures.

She barely glanced at the bag.

""Mr. Foster, since you ignored my calls all week, I took the liberty of drafting divorce papers. When can you make time to visit the courthouse?""

""Are you still hung up on this?"" His voice turned icy.

""They‚Äôre just flowers. No need to make a scene. Didn‚Äôt I bring Ariyah to apologize and replace them with red roses?""

""You‚Äôre two years older than her. Act like it.""

Ariyah Fox was Maximilian‚Äôs unrequited high school sweetheart.

She had turned him down back then to study abroad, and they lost touch.

Recently, she returned, and they reconnected at a reunion‚Äîfalling right back into old patterns.

Now, Maximilian traveled for work without his secretary, always with Ariyah in tow, sightseeing after meetings.

Skye wasn‚Äôt angry.

She didn‚Äôt blame Ariyah for knowingly being the other woman.

Because the real problem was Maximilian.

Chapter 2 - The Shattered Promise

If he hadn‚Äôt given such obvious signals, Ariyah wouldn‚Äôt have succeeded so easily.

And as for my reaction‚Äîthey‚Äôd both seen it coming.

The way Maximilian looked at me now carried that infuriating ""I told you so"" smirk.

He still thought I was being unreasonable.

""Skye, make me some late-night snacks,"" he ordered.

Once, hearing him call me ""Skye"" had felt like an endearment.

Now, it just sounded like a patronizing dismissal.

But I simply stood up, switched off the TV, and headed to my room.

""Too busy. I‚Äôm going to bed.""

""Let me know when you‚Äôre free, Mr. Foster. We have paperwork to settle.""

""Skye Marshall!"" Maximilian snapped, his voice sharp with anger.

""How long are you going to keep this act up?""

I turned, feigning innocence. ""Funny, isn‚Äôt divorcing me exactly what you wanted?""

""Once I‚Äôm gone, someone else can take my place.""

Maximilian‚Äôs glare turned icy.

""Giving you a week to cool off clearly didn‚Äôt help!""

""Out of consideration for your pregnancy, I‚Äôll let this slide‚Äîpretend you never said a word. But don‚Äôt push it.""

I hesitated.

Then, a bitter smile curled my lips.

""No need to pretend, Mr. Foster. I already took care of the baby.""

Ever since Ariyah returned from abroad, Maximilian had been glued to her side.

He claimed she was still adjusting to life back home and that, as an old friend, it was only natural for him to help her settle in.

It grated on me, but I tried to bear it.

Until a week ago.

Our wedding anniversary.

Maximilian had promised the day would be just for me.

We were supposed to revisit the beach where we first fell in love, then stop by the new mall opened by Foster Enterprises.

But the moment we arrived at the hotel, Ariyah called, and he rushed off.

""Ariyah‚Äôs running a fever. She needs someone to look after her.""

""She‚Äôs still just a girl. She can‚Äôt manage without me.""

And just like that, he left me behind.

Not long after he was gone, as I headed to the restaurant alone, a passerby knocked into me, sending me tumbling down the stairs.

By the time I reached the hospital, it was too late.

The baby was gone.

Our child had been shattered, then scraped piece by piece from my womb.

After the procedure, I lay there shaking, tears streaming as I called Maximilian.

But his voice was impatient.

""I told you I had something urgent. You‚Äôre an adult‚Äîcan‚Äôt you handle one day alone? It‚Äôs just an anniversary. I‚Äôll make it up to you later!""

Then, a soft, girlish voice chimed in. ""Maximilian, I‚Äôm hungry.""

Instantly, his tone softened. ""I‚Äôll make you some soup.""

He didn‚Äôt even wait for my reply.",2,1754966766.0,Novelnews,0,1.0,False

And I knew instantly‚Ä¶ this was going to be trouble because I recognized him.

But let‚Äôs rewind for context.

This guy used to be a regular until he got himself on our Do Not Rent list. He had a habit of obooking a room with an invalid card, promising to pay ‚Äúonce I get my salary,‚Äù then hanging out in the lobby for hours, drinking coffee, relaxing, before mysteriously disappearing without canceling.
He pulled it twice. The last time, he even came in early morning, had breakfast and then left. My manager warned him: lobby is for registered guests only, and if he did it again, he‚Äôd be banned. Of course‚Ä¶ he did it again.

Now back to that story. In the morning I saw his reservation popped up. I canceled it. And now this guy in front of me asking why he can‚Äôt stay here anymore. I briefly explained. 

He goes ‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt refuse service because of that. I spent here a lot of money here‚Äú. 

I said ‚ÄúYou can talk to my manager until then there‚Äôs nothing I can do‚Äù. 

He didn't accept my answer and continued to ask for details. 

And then I looked at his hand the way he hold his phone and ‚Ä¶ realized I was recorded all the time ‚Ä¶ 

I asked, ‚ÄúAre you recording me?

He said ‚Äúno‚Äù but I HEARD HIM TURNING OFF THE CAMERA. 

At that point I tell him to leave or I‚Äôll call the police, because he is not allowed to be here.

So if you stumble across a TikTok of a ‚Äúmean‚Äù front desk lady refusing some poor ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù guest‚Ä¶ yeah, that‚Äôs me. 

But honestly I don‚Äôt why but I felt really bad that day. I said nothing wrong and was polite as possible, but I don‚Äôt like being recorded without permission.

1mnx0uj,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mnx0uj,Stripe vs Square vs PayPal: The Brutally Honest Comparison That Could Save Your Business Thousands,"Let's cut straight to the chase: choosing the wrong payment processor can cost your small business thousands of dollars annually in unnecessary fees, lost sales, and operational headaches. I've watched too many entrepreneurs pick their payment processing solution based on what their friend uses or whichever company had the shiniest marketing campaign last month.

Today, we're putting the three heavyweight champions of payment processing in the ring together: Stripe, Square, and PayPal. No fluff, no corporate speak, just the real information you need to make the right choice for your specific business.

# The Stakes Are Higher Than You Think

Before we dive into the showdown, let's talk about why this decision matters so much. Your payment processor touches every single transaction in your business. Pick the wrong one, and you're looking at:

* Higher fees eating into already thin margins
* Frustrated customers abandoning their carts
* Hours wasted on clunky interfaces and poor integration
* Surprise account holds that can cripple your cash flow
* Chargeback nightmares that keep you up at night

I've seen businesses lose 2-3% of their total revenue just from being with the wrong processor. On $500,000 in annual sales, that's $10,000 to $15,000 straight off your bottom line.

# Round 1: The Fee Fight

Let's start with what hits your wallet directly: fees. All three processors have gotten more complex with their pricing over the years, so pay attention to the details.

**Square** comes out swinging with simplicity. Their standard rate is 2.6% + 10¬¢ for in-person transactions and 2.9% + 30¬¢ for online transactions. No monthly fees, no setup fees, no surprises. If you're doing $10,000 per month in online sales, you're looking at about $320 in processing fees.

**PayPal** matches Square's online rate at 2.9% + 30¬¢ for most transactions, but here's where it gets interesting: PayPal charges 3.49% + 49¬¢ for manually entered transactions. Running a service business where you invoice clients? That higher rate hurts. However, PayPal offers volume discounts starting at $3,000 monthly, dropping to 2.5% + 30¬¢ once you hit $10,000 monthly.

**Stripe** positions itself at 2.9% + 30¬¢ for online transactions, matching the others. But Stripe's secret weapon is custom pricing for high-volume businesses. I've worked with companies processing over $80,000 monthly who negotiated rates down to 2.4% + 24¬¢. That's a significant difference at scale.

**Winner: It depends on your volume.** For businesses under $3,000/month, Square's simplicity wins. For $3,000-$50,000/month, PayPal's automatic discounts edge ahead. Above $50,000/month, Stripe's negotiable rates take the crown.

# Round 2: The Chargeback Championship

Chargebacks are the bane of every small business owner's existence. One bad chargeback can wipe out the profit from dozens of good transactions. Here's how each platform handles these nightmares.

**Stripe** charges a $15 chargeback fee, win or lose. But their Radar fraud prevention system is genuinely impressive. One client of mine saw chargebacks drop by 40% after switching to Stripe. They also provide excellent documentation tools and templates for fighting disputes. Their win rate on contested chargebacks hovers around 30%, which is above industry average.

**Square** also charges $15 for chargebacks but takes a different approach. Their automatic chargeback protection on eligible transactions means you keep the money even if you lose the dispute. The catch? Only certain transactions qualify, and you need to follow their guidelines precisely. Miss one step, and you're on your own.

**PayPal** hits hardest with a $20 chargeback fee. However, their Seller Protection program is robust if you qualify. Ship to the address on file, keep your tracking information, and respond promptly to disputes, and PayPal often sides with sellers. Their massive user base also means customers are less likely to initiate chargebacks since they trust the PayPal dispute process.

**Winner: Stripe for prevention, PayPal for protection** (if you follow their rules religiously).

# Round 3: The User Experience Battle

You'll be living in your payment processor's dashboard daily. A terrible interface isn't just annoying; it costs you time and money.

**Square's** interface feels like it was designed by someone who actually runs a small business. Everything is where you'd expect it to be. Running reports takes seconds, not minutes. Their mobile app is particularly stellar. I've watched restaurant owners manage their entire payment operation from their phone while walking the floor.

**PayPal's** interface... well, it's gotten better. The problem is PayPal tries to be everything to everyone. You'll find yourself clicking through multiple menus to find basic features. Want to issue a partial refund? That's three screens deep. Need to pull last month's transaction report? Hope you bookmarked the direct link.

**Stripe's** dashboard is a developer's dream and a non-technical owner's learning curve. It's powerful, customizable, and comprehensive. But if you're not comfortable with technical terminology, you might feel overwhelmed initially. Once you climb the learning curve, though, Stripe's dashboard provides insights the others can't match.

**Winner: Square for simplicity, Stripe for power users.**

# Round 4: Integration and Compatibility Showdown

Your payment processor needs to play nice with the rest of your tech stack. Here's where things get interesting.

**Stripe** dominates the integration game. With over 300 direct integrations and the most comprehensive API in the business, Stripe connects to virtually everything. Using Shopify? Stripe's there. Running a subscription box on Cratejoy? Stripe works. Building a custom marketplace? Stripe's API makes it possible. If you're running multiple sales channels or planning to scale, Stripe's integration ecosystem is unmatched.

**Square** takes a different approach: they want to be your entire business operating system. Square Appointments, Square Inventory, Square Payroll, Square Marketing... the list goes on. If you buy into their ecosystem, everything works together beautifully. Step outside it, and integration options become limited. It's a walled garden, but it's a pretty nice garden if you're willing to stay inside.

**PayPal** sits in the middle. Their ""PayPal Checkout"" button is recognized by 89% of online shoppers, which can boost conversion rates by up to 44% according to their data. They integrate with most major platforms, though not as seamlessly as Stripe. The killer feature? International reach. PayPal operates in 200+ countries and handles currency conversion automatically.

**Winner: Stripe for flexibility, Square for all-in-one simplicity, PayPal for international reach.**

# Round 5: Customer Support Cage Match

When something goes wrong with payment processing (and it will), support quality can make or break your business day.

**Square** offers 24/7 phone support, which sounds great until you realize you're often talking to tier-one support who can't actually fix complex issues. Email support is better, with responses typically within 24 hours. Their community forums are surprisingly helpful, with actual Square employees providing detailed responses.

**PayPal's** support is... well, it's PayPal support. Horror stories abound of account freezes with no explanation and support tickets that disappear into the void. However, if you qualify for their Merchant Technical Support (processing over $3,000/month), the experience improves dramatically. Pro tip: Always use their callback feature rather than waiting on hold.

**Stripe** doesn't offer phone support for standard accounts, which seems insane until you use their email and chat support. Responses are fast, detailed, and from people who actually understand technical issues. Their documentation is so comprehensive that you'll rarely need support. For high-volume accounts, dedicated support becomes available.

**Winner: Square for accessibility, Stripe for quality.**

# The Industry-Specific Breakdown

Different businesses have different needs. Here's who wins in specific scenarios:

**Restaurants and Food Service:** Square dominates. Their POS systems, kitchen display systems, and integrated ordering make them the obvious choice. One pizzeria owner told me Square saved them 10 hours weekly on operations alone.

**E-commerce Stores:** Stripe edges ahead with superior checkout experiences, subscription handling, and fraud prevention. Their ability to handle complex scenarios like split payments and marketplace transactions is unmatched.

**Service Businesses:** PayPal works well here, especially if you're invoicing clients. Their invoice system is solid, and clients trust the PayPal brand. The ability to accept payments without clients creating accounts reduces friction.

**Retail Stores:** Square again. Their free POS software, inventory management, and employee management tools create an ecosystem that's hard to beat for brick-and-mortar operations.

**B2B Companies:** Stripe or PayPal, depending on transaction size. Stripe handles large transactions better and offers more payment methods. PayPal's brand recognition can speed up the trust-building process with new corporate clients.

# Hidden Costs and Gotchas

Every processor has hidden traps. Here are the big ones:

**Square's** instant deposit feature costs an extra 1.5%. Use it regularly, and you're adding significant cost to your processing. Their ""free"" POS software also pushes paid add-ons aggressively.

**PayPal** loves to hold funds for new sellers or unusual transaction patterns. I've seen established businesses have funds held for 21 days because they had one month of higher-than-usual sales. Their currency conversion fees (4% above market rate) can also sting international sellers.

**Stripe's** international card fees add an extra 1% for non-US cards. Their 0.5% fee for automated clearing house (ACH) payments seems small but adds up quickly for B2B companies. And while their API is powerful, you might need to hire a developer to fully utilize it.

# Making Your Decision: A Strategic Framework

Here's my framework for choosing:

**Choose Square if:**

* You're processing under $20,000/month
* You need a physical point of sale
* You want an all-in-one business solution
* Technical simplicity is your priority
* You're in food service or retail

**Choose PayPal if:**

* Your customers are consumers (not businesses)
* You sell internationally
* Brand recognition matters for trust
* You're processing $3,000-$50,000/month
* You invoice clients regularly

**Choose Stripe if:**

* You're technically savvy or have developer resources
* You need complex payment scenarios (subscriptions, marketplaces)
* You're scaling rapidly or processing over $50,000/month
* API flexibility is crucial
* You prioritize fraud prevention

# The Migration Reality Check

Switching payment processors isn't like changing your coffee supplier. You'll need to:

* Migrate customer payment methods (not always possible)
* Update all integration points
* Retrain staff on new systems
* Potentially redesign checkout flows
* Deal with parallel processing during transition

Budget at least 20 hours for a smooth transition, more if you have complex integrations.

# The Verdict

There's no universal ""best"" payment processor. Square wins on simplicity and ecosystem. PayPal wins on trust and international reach. Stripe wins on flexibility and scaling potential.

My advice? Start where you are. If you're just launching, go with Square for simplicity. As you grow and your needs become clearer, reassess. The cost of switching is far less than the cost of staying with the wrong processor for years.

Most importantly, treat this decision as reversible but important. You can always switch, but every month with the wrong processor costs you money and opportunities. Take action, monitor your actual costs and pain points, and adjust as needed.

The real winner in this payment processor gauntlet? The small business owner who takes time to match their specific needs with the right solution, rather than defaulting to what everyone else uses. Your business is unique. Your payment processing solution should match that uniqueness.

Remember: the best payment processor is the one that gets out of your way and lets you focus on growing your business. Everything else is just noise.

She was arrested on misdemeanor charges of resisting an officer without violence and trespassing in a structure or conveyance, according to a Sheriff's Office arrest report and county court records.

There is no mention in the arrest report of the sisters wanting Mejia taken to a mental health facility under the state's Baker Act.

Deputy Mallory Moyers, the arresting officer, said when she arrived, Mejia was ""causing a disturbance and randomly yelling at customers to leave the store in both English and Spanish.""

Moyers said in the report that she ordered Mejia, who was in the store parking lot, to leave with her two daughters who had arrived by that time. In addition, Moyers said that she warned Mejia several times that she was trespassing and would be arrested unless she left the store. But Mejia refused to leave, according to the arrest report.

A struggle ensued when deputies tried to take Mejia into custody. Mejia is accused of resisting arrest by pulling her arms away and refusing to comply with ""lawful"" commands from a Sheriff's Office corporal.

On Aug. 3, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) filed an Immigration Detainer against Mejia, saying the agency had ""determined that probable cause exists that the subject \[Mejia\] is a removeable individual.""

The DHS determination cited in the detainer document was in the form of a checked box for the following statement:

""Biometric confirmation of the individual's identity and a records check of federal databases that affirmatively indicate, by themselves or in addition to other reliable information, that the individual either lacks immigration status or notwithstanding such status is removable under U.S. immigration law; and/or the reason.""

The detainer further states that any immigration officer was authorized to arrest Mejia on warrants for ""immigration violations.""",0,1754966470.0,jacksonville,0,0.5,False

I saw some review on Trip Advisor that implied they were not honoring Globalist benefits, but this wasn't true for me. I had called up when I made the reservation and was assured this wasn't the case. The hotel seems to have been recently renovated and it is a nice, comfortable hotel that will provide a good home base for anyone who needs to be in this area. I certainly wouldn't call this hotel a destination in an of itself. There's no spa or spa services and the location surrounded by small businesses and warehouses as well as the aforementioned airport. 

The sound proofing is impressive and I couldn't hear any jets or airplanes anywhere inside. The lobby is nice, open, bright and contemporary. There's a small pool table for guest, a bar (as you'd expect), a convenient coffee and grab and go food counter as well as their main restaurant. Breakfast each morning was the standard fare, but entirely acceptable. All items were fresh and continually maintained. I also ate lunch there and was impressed by the Oriental chicken salad. It was delicious.

The gym was adequate for a quick workout. Dumbells only go up to 50 lbs which is a little disappointing, but not the end of the world.

I was solo and booked a king room. Upgrade was to the 6th floor (still a standard king room) of the 7 floor building. View was of the airport and downtown Irvine. At night, I had a nice view of the Irvine Spectrum Center. The room was contemporary and very well maintained. I liked the Lutron lighting system. It also has the old style HVAC with manual dials, so you can set the temperature and setting to whatever you want with no fear of it shutting off in the middle of the night because of no motion and not turning off if you open the sliding door to the balcony for a minute to take in the view. There are motion sensors on the lights which you can disable by pulling the ""air gap"" slider on the light controls. The bed was comfortable. Turn down service was unseen, but done each day.

The pool and hot tub were OK. They felt heavily chlorinated and while they try to make the most of their limited space, it does feel a little closed in and lacks any sense of lushness.

Parking is easy and they charge $30 overnight, but if you have guests, they can park in the self parking during the day without incurring any fee. Its also quick to get on the highway to get other anywhere in the area.

All in all, I'd recommend this hotel for someone staying in the area that needs a relatively basic hotel. It was perfect for my needs.",5,1754966415.0,hyatt,1,1.0,False

I had waited five years for Fredric to acknowledge me publicly as his wife . Five years of a hidden marriage .

  
But truth be told , had loved him for fifteen years since we were children . Even if he was cold as ice.I was willing to keep warming him saying "" I love you "" again and again , even if it took ninety - nine times to melt him . & Everyone thought I would never leave Fredric . But two weeks ago , the day my mother was dying , I begged him to drive me to the hospital . He left me on the side of the highway in a torrential downpour , all because his first love had called .

  
By the time I finally made it to the hospital , drenched and trembling , my mother only had enough strength to hold my hand before she passed away . That moment shattered me . I had always told myself Fredric was just emotionally distant , not heartless . But at the hospital , his first love smiled sweetly at me and said ,"" Can't you tell ? Fredric is cold to everyone except me . "" Then she threw a photo in my face .

# Introduction

Welcome to the third post in my Salary Series! In my previous post, I wrote about¬†[how companies determine employee salaries](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-2-unpacking-company-salaries-and-bonuses/). In this post, we‚Äôll leverage all the knowledge we learnt and my experiences to help negotiate a salary raise!

Below, I share a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to¬†[operate from a position of strength](https://thewealthmeta.com/operating-from-a-position-of-strength/)¬†to get the salary raise you want.

# Fundamental methods to increase your salary

Before we dive in, I want to share the ways to increase your salary, which are to:

* Negotiate a higher salary for your current role
* Get a promotion or job offer within the same company with a higher salary
* Get a job offer with another company that pays higher (job hopping)

For this post, I‚Äôm focusing on negotiating a higher salary for your current role. Future posts will cover how to negotiate salaries when getting a promotion and also when job-hopping.

# But first: The most critical factor to long-term salary (and career) growth

In the short term, negotiating and job hopping will lead to salary increases, but that‚Äôs a short-term bump.

In the long term, salary growth will ultimately need to come from 2 underlying factors:

1. **Value**. The more that you deliver, the more you are compensated for it. This is derived from
   * Locus of responsibility ‚Äì the more people and scope you look after, the wider potential value you can deliver due to the ability to drive outputs using the resources assigned to you
   * Magnitude of Impact ‚Äì how much change and positive outcomes you affect
2. **Scarcity.**¬†The harder it is to attain the skills and experience required of the role, the higher the salary for the role. This typically boils down to (non-exhaustive)
   * Supply of similar candidates. In the industry, we describe markets as candidate-long or candidate-sort markets
   * Generic vs specialised skillsets. Specialised (or technical skillsets) that are harder to acquire will command a premium, but only up to a point.

**The TL:DR is, you need to be a high performer.**¬†High performers take on more responsibility, get more senior positions, and ultimately deliver higher value. And that‚Äôs what ultimately drives a sustained upwards trajectory in your salary that lasts for decades.

If you‚Äôre an average (or below average) performer, and you keep on asking your manager every year for an above-average salary increment, you‚Äôre just going to frustrate your manager.

Don‚Äôt forget to constantly develop yourself and perform better than the day before.

# Principles of salary negotiations

No matter the process you take, the principles below are what I believe are true in all salary negotiations.

**Understand the process.**¬†If you don‚Äôt understand the process and play the game, you‚Äôre trying to swim against the current. That‚Äôs why I wrote the previous¬†[post on how companies decide employee salaries](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-2-unpacking-company-salaries-and-bonuses/).

**Pre-read before meetings.**¬†The bigger the stakes, the more important it is to send a pre-read before a meeting. Pre-read is giving upfront information/documentation ahead of the upcoming meeting to allow the audience to digest the information and prepare for it. This allows the audience not to be caught off-guard, be informed and prepared before the meeting. You should do the same in salary negotiations. No manager likes being put on the spot when a team member suddenly asks for a salary raise.

**Document everything.**¬†You‚Äôre going to need data points. No one can argue against objective data on results, contributions, and positive feedback from others. If you take the time to document everything immediately throughout the year (and not 3 days before you have the meeting), you‚Äôre going to have a mountain of data to justify your promotion that will be hard to argue against.

**Timing matters.**¬†You don‚Äôt ask for a raise when the company (and the economy) is struggling. You also need to find the best timings to schedule meetings with your manager. The right conditions are 1) The company is performing well, 2) You are performing well and have just achieved a milestone, and 3) Your manager is also in good standing at work.

**Be professional, polite and positive**. Your manager is not going to react well to direct/veiled threats. The uncomfortable truth of the workplace is that everyone is replaceable, including you. So why burn bridges?

**Make it easier for your manager.**¬†Your manager either has to justify your raise to their manager or ask someone higher up the ladder for approval. Make it easier for your manager by 1) removing barriers, 2) creating materials to easily communicate your proposal (see Business case later on)

**Show future commitment.**¬†Most people justify salary increases based on past performance. The more compelling narrative is to justify a salary raise based on what you can deliver in the future. Why would a manager agree to a raise if they don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll stick around in the next 6 months?

**Use annual gross salaries.**¬†This shows your business acumen. Fully loaded employee expenses are typically 1.5x ‚Äì 2.0x of gross annual salaries (because of insurance, office space, equipment, other benefits, etc). The layperson thinks in terms of a monthly base salary. Leaders and business-savvy people think in terms of the total package. You know your cost to the business, you can quantify the ROI of salary increases versus the value you bring. Gross means annual salaries, including employer EPF and allowances (exclude bonuses, include ‚Äú13th month salary‚Äù). If you stick to a mindset of monthly base salaries, you potentially leave money on the table, i.e. higher employee EPF contributions, allowances, and also big picture thinking from a PF perspective.

# The salary negotiation process

Alright! Let‚Äôs get into the nitty gritty of it. Another disclaimer here, many are going to think this is way too much work, and that it‚Äôs not worth it. But then again, above-average performers put in the work and get better salary raises. How badly do you want it?

[\[Chart 1: Negotiation Process\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise.png)

**Step 1**:¬†**Investigate processes**

This is super important. Uncover the detailed salary policies and processes for your company. You need to tailor your approach to how your company manages the process. Don‚Äôt fight against the current; work with it.

Where and how do you find this information?

* **Search internal HR policies and documentation.**¬†This would be on your company intranet/portal and sometimes even part of an employee handbook. If you‚Äôre lucky, the whole process might be explicit and transparent
* **HR announcements and emails.**¬†Before performance reviews, you‚Äôll normally receive emails and updates on how the process works, along with key dates.
* **Chat with your team members/colleagues**. Many people are willing to share information about their salaries, experiences and insights. If you‚Äôre lucky, you can get a lot of insights, especially with more senior/experienced colleagues who might share with you data points that can help you argue your case for a salary increase (such as what they‚Äôre earning, what are typical salary increments, which managers are receptive to it, etc)
* **Make friends with HR and Finance.**¬†These two departments are key. If you have friends / close colleagues in Finance, you‚Äôll know in greater detail what the annual budget planning key dates are, how the employee expense budgets are shaping up for next year (e.g. 5% increase to total pool), and senior management‚Äôs sentiment on the company performance. If you build relationships with HR, you might even get snippets on what the grade levels are like for your level (and above you), or even who the actual decision makers are for salary increases, etc.
* **Ask your direct manager**. You‚Äôre in good standing with your manager, right? You‚Äôre a good performer, have good rapport, and have regular fortnightly 1-on-1 catch-ups, right? So go ahead and ask your manager, ‚ÄúHow does the salary review process work here?‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not in good standing with your manager, maybe you should be working on that first before even thinking of asking for a raise
* **Connect with previous employees.**¬†Know someone who used to work at your company? They might be willing to be more open and transparent, as there‚Äôs less risk of any consequences for them sharing information with you

**Step 2: Initial discussion and alignment**

You‚Äôve developed an understanding of how the game is played at your current company; now it‚Äôs time to plant the seeds and set things in motion. If you haven‚Äôt asked your manager how salary reviews and increments work at your current company, this is an excellent way to broach the topic of a salary raise.

How do you go about it? Well, before your next 1-on-1, send a note to your manager with your usual pre-wire updates, at least 2-3 days beforehand (pre-wiring in general is such an underrated move, I should write a whole article about it).

Something like this:

>

This gives your manager the time and space to gather thoughts and react accordingly in the meeting. Contrast this with ‚Äúambushing‚Äù your manager during the performance review period; your manager would highly appreciate it if you brought this up beforehand.

In the meeting itself, you would ask questions to get better clarity on the process, close any gaps in your understanding, and most importantly, to test the waters. Some key points to broach during the meeting, once your questions about the salary review process have been answered:

>

As you can see, this is not the meeting where you already know how much you want (although you may have a number in mind). You don‚Äôt know if your manager hates people asking for raises. You don‚Äôt know what the barriers are in the process. Your immediate objective is to see how your manager reacts and use that to prep for the next discussion.

Some managers may want to see if you already have a number in mind, which I would say:

>

If your manager reacts badly to this meeting, you know you‚Äôre not in good standing, and you might want to consider your prospects in that team (or company).

If your manager is neutral, e.g. proposes to revisit salary discussions closer to the performance review cycle, it‚Äôs still alright. You‚Äôve flagged upfront your intentions, and you can skip the next steps (3 & 4).

Ideally, you would have received some feedback during the meeting that you can use to propose targets at the next 1-on-1 on what you need to achieve to get a salary raise. A simple 1-pager with bullet points articulating¬†[SMART goals](https://thewealthmeta.com/how-smart-are-your-financial-goals/)¬†should do.

The best time to do this is at the beginning of the financial year, during the KPI setting season. As you‚Äôre setting up your KPIs with your manager, it‚Äôs opportune because you can set the typical targets, but also stretch targets to get that salary increase.

**Step 3: Agree on written targets**

Based on the initial discussion and other pieces of information, develop a draft one-pager or bullet points in an email of what you propose as targets to achieve to get a raise. Send that to your manager a few days before your next 1-on-1, similar to step 2.

In your 1-on-1, you refine the targets and hopefully get an agreement/understanding that your manager will increase your salary above the baseline (meaning, the basic inflation salary increment all employees will receive).

Your manager might ask how much you expect to receive as part of the agreement. Your manager may not. My suggestion is to reemphasise what I suggested in Step 2.

Once you agree on the targets, save the document with your targets and send it to your manager. This is important to ensure that the agreement is locked in.

**Step 4: Document everything**

Note: Some company KPI targets have base and stretch goals. Whether you align the stretch goal KPIs to the targets for getting your salary raise is up to you.

Again. Document everything. I have an email folder in my inbox titled ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù. Every praise, every milestone achieved, every performance result worth documenting goes in there. Every report/dashboard that is related to your outputs should go in there.

Outside of that email folder, every few weeks or every month, block out time to gather data on your projects and daily tasks. How well you‚Äôve performed versus your targets AND in comparison with your colleagues (yes, working life is competitive). Keep track of it in your performance file, a.k.a. detailed CV. It‚Äôs like a lengthy journal of accomplishments; it will also serve you well when looking for a new job. I‚Äôll cover it in more detail in a future post about job hopping.

All the information you gather will be important in creating the business case that you forward to your manager when asking for the raise.

**Step 5: Check-in and iterate**

You‚Äôre still having fortnightly check-ins, right? Every month or two, take the opportunity to discuss your progress towards hitting those targets and also receive feedback so you can improve. Continue documenting and getting alignment so that you know you‚Äôre on the right track.

In a 1 on 1 check-in that coincides with budget season, remind your manager of the agreed plan, and get a deeper pulse check on how your manager views your performance.

**Step 6: Deliver on agreed targets**

I don‚Äôt need to tell you how you‚Äôre going to excel at your job and deliver above expectations. That‚Äôs up to you!

**Step 7: Communicate achievements**

Sometimes your manager may not even know the extent of the hard work you‚Äôve put in, and sometimes they may not even know the outcomes or results of your efforts. This is where the extroverts and people who promote (brag) about themselves shine. You need to be comfortable with promoting yourself.

Now there is one other person who it‚Äôs even more important to promote yourself to. It is the decision maker who is highly likely to be your manager‚Äôs manager. Does he/she know who you are? What have you achieved? The value do you bring to the company? Do you have a good relationship with him/her? If the answer is no to all these questions, why would that person approve your salary raise, even if your manager fights for you?

The simplest way to promote yourself to your manager‚Äôs manager is to have a coffee catch-up with them. In that meeting, be curious but also subtly reveal what you have been doing and achieved, and heap praise on your manager. Bring up how you enjoy working at the company, how you want to deliver more impact and more value, etc.

**Step 8: Build network and political capital**

How is this relevant to your salary raise, you may ask? Many companies have 360 feedback loops for each employee as part of performance reviews. But even if not, the more advocates and ‚Äúsponsors‚Äù you have in the company, the more people you have to vouch for you via ‚Äúback channels‚Äù.

This becomes especially important if performance reviews undergo calibration among managers across the company. Other managers whom you don‚Äôt report to may vouch for you in these calibration meetings. When I was in consulting, it was quite typical for us to approach as many ‚Äúseniors‚Äù above us, all the way to partner level, to support our promotions/reviews in these meetings. I‚Äôve also been a manager who has vouched for other employees in these discussions.¬†

**Step 9: Develop business case**

What is a business case? It‚Äôs a general term to describe a document that articulates a proposal or pitch, with justifications clearly articulated (typically in the form of an ROI).

Developing a business case is crucial to getting the best outcome. Why? It shows black and white proof with all the research and analysis proving you deserve a raise, eliminating any objections in the process.

It can be in the form of a Word document or PowerPoint slides. Whatever suits your style. What‚Äôs important is putting it in writing.

Your business case would have the following components (along with examples of ‚Äúwhat good looks like‚Äù).

**Context.**¬†Recap previous discussions and the agreement between you and your manager. Don‚Äôt forget to include ‚Äú**The Ask**‚Äú, being the specific amount of raise you‚Äôre asking for.

Something like the slide below:

[\[Slide 1: Overview\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise-1.png)

**Justifications.**¬†Technically, the example above had the justifications already. But in the following section, you would expand the justifications in more detail. You also need to show evidence for each point. Some examples of types of justifications:

* Achieved previously agreed targets for a salary increase (as per step 3)
* Delivered exceptional value above BAU targets, totalling \[XX\] for the company, contributing \[XX\] in revenue and \[YY\] in cost savings
* Performance in the top 25th percentile across comparable roles in the company (relative to peers)
* Underpaid relative to internal and external benchmarks
* Position assumed higher responsibilities over time compared to the original role responsibilities

The slide below shows how you could translate your achievements into quantitative benefits (which would ideally be more than the raise you‚Äôre asking for):

[\[Slide 2: Justification 1 - Achievements\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise-2.png)

The example below is a sample slide outlining how the responsibilities of your role might have expanded from when you first started in the role. Don‚Äôt forget to quantify how much additional tasks, time and effort are spent because of the increase in responsibilities.

[\[Slide 3: Justification 2 - Increased responsibilities\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise-3.png)

Showing data points showing how your salary stacks up versus other comparable roles is extremely powerful. It‚Äôs a lot better than just verbalising ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done market research and I think I‚Äôm 20% underpaid‚Äù.

Research salaries on Glassdoor, MalaysianPAYGAP, recruitment firm salary reports, job portal salary reports, etc. Also, do include links/screenshots in the appendix for proof of these salaries, for which you compare your current and proposed salaries.

[\[Slide 4: Justification 3 - Salary benchmarks\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise-4.png)

**Stakeholder feedback.**¬†Show comments/feedback from others/champions, which validates your performance and how much that ‚Äústakeholders across the company and customers recognise and value what I deliver‚Äù.

[\[Slide 5: Stakeholder feedback\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise-5.png)

**Plans to deliver additional value.**¬†You need to show that you are committed to the company and are not a flight risk. You need to show them that it is worth investing in you and granting that salary increase.

So what do you do?

* You identify new opportunities to deliver value, eg more process improvements, will take on more responsibility, etc., and propose that you take them on in the future.
* You emphasise that you want to be involved in key projects and be a significant contributor to the success of the company, so you have aligned interests and show even more commitment

Something like below:

[\[Slide 6: Future value and commitment\]](https://thewealthmeta.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/20250831-Salary-Series_How-to-negotiate-a-salary-raise-6.png)

**Appendix.**¬†Include any additional supporting documentation/evidence as necessary to back up your case.

**Step 10: Meeting preparation**

You‚Äôve got the business case, now you need to make sure it is bulletproof. Three key ways to prepare to land the negotiation:

1. **Ask someone to review your business case.**¬†A friend, a mentor, or your partner can help. No errors, nothing too aggressive or rude. Always worth having a second pair of eyes to spot any gaps or issues.
2. **Practice by role-playing.**¬†Similar to practising for interviews, have someone role-play your manager and so you can rehearse your key talking points
3. **Send the pre-read**. Send your business case as a pre-read to your manager before the meeting where you will discuss your business case. A few days to a week before. This gives time and space to your manager to carefully consider the business case, and he/she will respect you for that (in addition to being impressed at the amount of due diligence you have put into your business case)

**Step 11: Business case presentation**

This can be daunting for many people, especially if it‚Äôs your first time. The good news is, you‚Äôve done all the legwork throughout the year and emailed a pre-read. As a reminder, the pre-read gives your manager space to think, and makes the conversation easier to manage.

Be confident, assertive, yet collaborative and polite. An example flow and scripts for how to carry the conversation are below. Do ensure you rehearse this as part of Step 10 Preparation.

**Cover key points**

>

**Re-emphasise commitment to the company**

>

**Share that you‚Äôre happy for your manager to forward the document to whoever is part of the review/approval process**

>

**Seek open-ended feedback from your manager**

>

**Pitch it like a collaborative effort, remove blockers**

>

**Step 12: Objection handling**

If you‚Äôve done the work and your justifications are valid, there should be fewer chances of pushback from your manager.

However, it can still occur more likely than not. You can only show your worth and try to influence the decision. Some additional tips

* Use open-ended language (avoid yes or no questions)
* Empathise with your manager (who may be in a difficult spot), reframe the conversation to be collaborative, e.g. ‚ÄúWhat could we do together to solve this challenge?‚Äù
* Focus on using calibrated questions, e.g. ‚ÄúHow does this sound to you?‚Äù

I won‚Äôt plagiarise too much, so I recommend reading this article titled ‚Äú[Asking for a raise? Here‚Äôs what a hostage negotiator would do](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/how-to-ask-for-a-raise)‚Äù for some of the best negotiation tactics using collaborative, unthreatening language. No point regurgitating a post that has better information and experience than I do on the topic.

**Step 13: Outcome**

If you receive the raise you requested, congratulations! Be appreciative, thank your manager and celebrate!

If you were rejected or received less than you asked for, accept it gracefully. Again, be polite, professional and positive. Ask your manager, ‚ÄúWhat can I do to get the raise next year?‚Äù. This demonstrates grace, commitment, openness to collaboration, and, most importantly, the ability to manage expectations that you‚Äôll continue the negotiations in the next annual cycle.

# What you should never do when negotiating

**Use personal reasons as a justification.**¬†Your manager and company are not responsible for your personal commitments and circumstances. It‚Äôs unprofessional to use guilt and a sad story to try to appeal for a raise.

**Discussing your salary raise potential at every single check-in**. Focus on delivering value, i.e. performance and improving from feedback. Don‚Äôt be needy.

**Threaten to find another job**. Most people don‚Äôt respond well to threats. Especially when every employee is fungible and replaceable.

**Get the raise and then quit**. This is just extremely bad etiquette.

**Propose a salary range**. Always be specific. It shows that you are confident and have done the work to ascertain your value. Plus, if you give a range, why would the decision makers give you anything less than the minimum of the range you proposed?

**Use a colleague‚Äôs salary as a justification to increase your salary**. You found out your colleague is being paid more than you. A lot more. You‚Äôre envious. It‚Äôs not fair. You raise it as a point. It‚Äôs not going to end well. There could be a multitude of reasons why your colleague is paid more (even though they are a much better performer than you). Don‚Äôt open up a can of worms or Pandora‚Äôs box. You might not like what you see. Play the game.

# FAQ

**Not all roles have quantifiable metrics that can translate to dollars and cents**

I‚Äôd wager 95% of job responsibilities can be quantified into metrics and compared. Examples:

* **HR**¬†‚Äì Average time to hire of 2 months from job posting request to signing of offer letter across 50 hires, 20% faster than department average, with 100% offer acceptance rate (vs 95% department average)
* **Software engineer**¬†‚Äì Shipped 30% more commits than team average, with 20% fewer defects identified during code review and test phases
* **Nurse**¬†‚Äì Patient-to-nurse care ratio 20% above ward average, with a 0.001% medication error rate vs the hospital average of 0.008%
* **Graphic designer**¬†‚Äì Delivered creative outputs consistently 2-3 days before SLAs (30% higher efficiency), resulting in a productivity uplift of 20% additional client deliverables

And once you can quantify, you can convert that to cost savings (hours saved to salary cost) or revenue uplift (additional sales or yield from your contributions).

**Won‚Äôt sending a pre-read to my manager give them time to come up with counter-arguments?**

Sure. But if your business case has gaps and counterpoints to begin with, that just means your business case isn‚Äôt strong, and maybe the raise isn‚Äôt justified.

**Some of these steps seem over the top, like having an agreement on stretch targets or developing a business case document. Isn‚Äôt it too presumptuous / try hard?**

I‚Äôm outlining a comprehensive step-by-step salary negotiation process based on ‚Äúwhat good looks like‚Äù.

Most people don‚Äôt even ask for a salary raise. And out of those that do, are underprepared for it. What makes you think putting in less effort than I described will get you that raise?

Of course, there‚Äôs an element of what‚Äôs suitable based on your specific situation (e.g. if you just got promoted, don‚Äôt go discussing a potential raise in the next cycle). Use your best judgment.

# Wrapping up

Salary raise negotiations aren‚Äôt easy, and there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll get the raise you want.

If you feel that you‚Äôre not getting raises because you‚Äôve reached the ceiling for that grade level (or some other reason), perhaps it‚Äôs time to¬†**get a promotion or job hop**.

Which are the next two topics for my upcoming posts in this Salary Series. Stay tuned!

1mnwula,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1mnwula/divorce_now_you_kneel_novel/,Divorce? Now You Kneel Novel,"Chapter 1 By the time Marceline Ballard arrived at the hillside villa, she was breathless, and the party inside had long since started. The person at the front door was surprised to see her. He clearly hadn't expected her to show up. ""Ms. Ballard, what are you doing here? Everyone's already eaten‚Ä¶"" This was her husband's birthday celebration, and yet, no one had thought to invite his legally wedded wife.

  
Among all these people in their social circle, not a single person bothered to contact her. Marceline gave the doorman a faint smile and was just about to push open the door when she heard voices from inside. ""Jenna, what did you get him? Curtis hasn't taken his eyes off your gift for a while now. He's been looking forward to opening it all evening."" ""Have I now?"" ""Don't pretend. The bag's practically got two holes burned into it from your staring.

  
Since Jenna's finally back, why don't you just divorce Marceline already? It's better than keeping things awkward for everyone."" ""Exactly. If you hadn't married her out of pity after she drugged you to save her reputation, she would've been publicly shamed to oblivion."" The man seated in the very center wore a sharp, dark suit, with the top two buttons of his shirt undone. His features were striking and sharp, with deep-set eyes, a high bridge, and thin lips.

  
He was like a colorful but poisonous butterfly, and his slightly upturned eyes gave him a distant and prideful appearance. ""There's no rush,"" he said. ""Curtis, it's been three years. What do you mean there's no rush? It was her fault Jenna's sister ended up in a vegetative state. If your grandmother hadn't protected her, we would've destroyed her long ago."" Curtis Wolfe fiddled with the lighter between his slender fingers, his gaze flickering to the figure at the doorway.

  
It was only then that the others realized Marceline had been standing there for some time now. Someone whispered, ""Did any of you invite her?"" No one responded, which meant that she had come uninvited. Marceline lowered her gaze. She had a light colored cashmere sweater on, and her hair was neatly tucked behind her ear. With her gentle demeanor and delicate features, she hardly seemed like the type to do anything shameless. But apparently, she had.

  
As she held a gift in her hands, she looked at Curtis in the center. She felt as though barbed wire was coiled around her chest, the piercing pain burrowing so deeply that she involuntarily clenched her hands into fists. Marceline walked up to Curtis, but before she could hand him the well-thought-out gift, he knitted his brows slightly and sneered with indifference. ""Who said you could come?"" Derisive laughter echoed around Marceline, chipping away at her dignity.

  
Jenna Farrell was seated nearby. She playfully glared at Curtis before pulling Marceline to sit down. ""Come on, she's your wife. It's only right that she came to give you a gift. ""Sit, Marceline. Curtis is just grumpy as always."" Marceline kept silent, her lips tightly pursed. She was his wife, and yet it was his ex-fianc√©e who was helping her smooth things over.

  
No one here welcomed her, but Marceline still came-all because Curtis had said that they'd spend his 28th birthday together back when he was 18. Without hesitation, she took a seat beside Curtis and edged Jenna out of the way. Jenna's expression faltered for a moment, looking displeased. She then asked, ""So, what gift did you get for Curtis?"" A curious onlooker reached over and opened the gift directly. It was a scarf without a label-most likely a hand-knit one.

  
""Oh, wow."" Jenna remarked, ""We must really think alike-I also made him a scarf."" The two hand-knit scarves were then placed side by side. It was hard to tell which was better made. Just then, someone accidentally bumped the table. Then, an opened bottle of wine tipped over, sending a stream of red liquid rushing toward both scarves. Curtis reached out to grab one of them while the other got soaked in wine. The one he grabbed was Jenna's.

  
Upon seeing the scarf she'd spent two months knitting now drenched in alcohol, Marceline went pale, and her heart felt numb and heavy. Jenna let out a sigh, linking arms with her in a comforting gesture. ""Don't be upset, Marceline. Just wash it when you get home, and it'll be good as new."" Ignoring her, Marceline turned to Curtis. He was looking down, concealing whatever emotions he was feeling. The atmosphere became a little awkward.

  
Then, as if Marceline had ruined what was meant to be a cheerful gathering, one by one, people started standing up and claiming they had to leave. Marceline sat still, staring at the scarf abandoned on the coffee table. It resembled her own situation. As the others gradually left, she saw Curtis getting up as well. She softly said, ""Curtis, happy birthday."" But Curtis acted as if he hadn't heard her. The people around him were all part of his elite circle.

  
Curtis had only been found by the Wolfe family when he was 21, but by then, he was already a self-made business prodigy-and beside him had been the 19-year-old Marceline. Within just seven years, the rising business star had become a central figure among the elite. But the love between them had long since vanished. Those tough, humble days they had weathered together now seemed like a past life. Curtis soon asked someone to drive Jenna home.

  
Jenna lightly tapped his shoulder, saying, ""You two should talk things out. Stop fighting all the time."" Someone nearby snorted. ""Jenna, you really are too nice."" ""It's not about being nice. Marceline was young and foolish back then. She probably didn't mean it."" ""As if. She ruined someone's life, shamelessly stole your place, and still has the nerve to show up here."" The voice, thick with contempt, gradually faded. Marceline sat there as if frozen in place.

  
Every inch of her blood began to go cold, and even her lips lost their color. She stood up, grabbed her soaked scarf, and looked at Curtis. ""Curtis,"" she softly called out. Curtis had already slung his suit jacket over his arm by then. Upon hearing her voice, he loosened his tie slightly without looking at her.

  
Visibly irritated, he asked, ""What do you want to say now?"" With a faint smile, Marceline uttered, ""Let's get a divorce, Curtis."" A flicker of surprise crossed his gaze, but it soon gave way to a chilling, dark stare. ""What's your angle this time? First, you drugged me to get me into bed, and now you're acting all high and mighty, demanding a divorce.

  
Aren't you tired of all this, Marceline?"" ""I'm sorry for wasting three years of your life, but I'm serious this time."" The scorn in Curtis' eyes slowly faded. He yanked Marceline toward him and clamped her chin between his fingers. When she winced in pain, it eased the inexplicable tension in his chest. ""You're talking about wasting time now? What the hell were you doing three years ago? You want a divorce, you say?

  
Fine, but don't expect me to give you a damn cent!"" ""I'll leave with nothing."" Marceline's eyes were clear, and her voice remained calm and unbothered. After Curtis was brought back to the Wolfe family back then, Marceline-who had been with him-was formally acknowledged by his parents as their goddaughter. However, everyone knew that they only did it because they didn't want their long-lost second son to marry a woman of humble origins.

  
Giving her that title was merely their way of silencing public opinion. Curtis stared at her indifferent face, his throat tightening soundlessly before he turned away. ""Fine. Leave with nothing. Just don't regret it."" Previous Chapter

1mnwq64,https://www.reddit.com/r/TalesFromTheFrontDesk/comments/1mnwq64/i_think_i_might_have_a_stalker/,I think I might have a stalker‚Ä¶,"I‚Äôve been at my property for a year now. When I first started, I worked both AM and PM shifts. About a few months in, I got switched to full time AM with the occasional PM shift once in a while to help out. These last 3 weeks, I‚Äôve been pulling 2 PM shifts a week since we are down an agent. 

When I worked both shifts, this guy ‚ÄúX‚Äù would come stay with us 2-3 times a month. Usually on points, but sometimes he pays. everyone remembers him because he‚Äôs always got something to complain about. We always played nice just to keep the peace. We noticed he hadn‚Äôt been staying with us for a bit, and thought he finally moved on to another hotel. 

Fast forward to me working mainly just AM shifts. I would randomly see ‚ÄúX‚Äù come in and grab breakfast and some coffee. I would look up in our system to see which room he was in to prep for any complaints, but he never had a reservation when I saw him get breakfast. (When he was actually staying I never saw him get breakfast. Just come downstairs and leave for the day saying bye on his way out). Still, whatever. I don‚Äôt ever make a fuss about people grabbing breakfast if they‚Äôre not a guest, as long as they don‚Äôt make it noticeable and other guests don‚Äôt complain. ‚Äî this turned from occasionally to frequently. He never caused issues with other guests, so I‚Äôve always let it slide and just smiled at him. 

A couple months ago, I started seeing him in the early afternoon, towards the ends of my shifts, just kinda lingering around - again, no reservation. One of these afternoons, he finally leaves after sitting in the lobby drinking coffee. Not even an hour later, I see his name pop up on the caller ID at the hotel phone. I answer it, he starts off saying he had a great stay, employees were great blah blah blah. He then asks if I‚Äôm single. I kinda just laugh it off and tell him I‚Äôm married with a kid, but thank you for the flatter. He then goes on this 8 minute (pretty close to it) spiel about how my husband is a lucky man snatching me up, what he would give to be my husband, telling me I‚Äôm pretty. I tel him thank you and be super nice to get him off the phone. He then switched his attitude and started talking about the incidental hold we did on a previous reservation *eyeroll* 

When I go to lunch sometimes I‚Äôll sit in my car, and there‚Äôs been 3 different days he pulls up right next to my car, sometimes even with an empty lot. Coincidental I know. Probably. But regardless, he knows what my car looks like. The very few PM shifts I have pulled over the last few months, I‚Äôll see him walk in, smile at me, and walk to the bathrooms. He walks down the hall outside, and I go to watch him on cameras, and quite often his car is parked next to mine or a few spots down. He‚Äôll wait for hours until the end of my shift and ‚Äúaccidentally ‚Äú run into me outside. The last few weeks I have seen him so much on my PM shifts and his car is parked next to mine. Sometimes he‚Äôs in his car when I leave, sometimes he‚Äôs not. Last night, I had my NA walk me to my car because I saw his car out there again. His car drove off once my NA walked outside with me. 
I saw him tonight in the halls. He saw me and waved but didn‚Äôt saw anything to me thankfully, and kept walking to the outside door. 

I‚Äôve asked the other PM shifts and AM shifts if they see him, and they say no unless his reservation is in house already. I don‚Äôt think anyone is giving out my schedule. It could be purely coincidental, but I‚Äôm just getting bad vibes from it all. He‚Äôs never been aggressive, besides the complaints. Idk. I could be overreacting, it‚Äôs just really weird that he seems to show up on my shifts and no one else‚Äôs. ",10,1754965635.0,TalesFromTheFrontDesk,8,1.0,False

# Introduction

Welcome to the third post in my Salary Series! In my previous post, I wrote about¬†[how companies determine employee salaries](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-2-unpacking-company-salaries-and-bonuses/). In this post, we‚Äôll leverage all the knowledge we learnt and my experiences to help negotiate a salary raise!

Below, I share a detailed, step-by-step guide on how to¬†[operate from a position of strength](https://thewealthmeta.com/operating-from-a-position-of-strength/)¬†to get the salary raise you want.

# Fundamental methods to increase your salary

Before we dive in, I want to share the ways to increase your salary, which are to:

* Negotiate a higher salary for your current role
* Get a promotion or job offer within the same company with a higher salary
* Get a job offer with another company that pays higher (job hopping)

For this post, I‚Äôm focusing on negotiating a higher salary for your current role. Future posts will cover how to negotiate salaries when getting a promotion and also when job-hopping.

# But first: The most critical factor to long-term salary (and career) growth

In the short term, negotiating and job hopping will lead to salary increases, but that‚Äôs a short-term bump.

In the long term, salary growth will ultimately need to come from 2 underlying factors:

1. **Value**. The more that you deliver, the more you are compensated for it. This is derived from
   * Locus of responsibility ‚Äì the more people and scope you look after, the wider potential value you can deliver due to the ability to drive outputs using the resources assigned to you
   * Magnitude of Impact ‚Äì how much change and positive outcomes you affect
2. **Scarcity.**¬†The harder it is to attain the skills and experience required of the role, the higher the salary for the role. This typically boils down to (non-exhaustive)
   * Supply of similar candidates. In the industry, we describe markets as candidate-long or candidate-sort markets
   * Generic vs specialised skillsets. Specialised (or technical skillsets) that are harder to acquire will command a premium, but only up to a point.

**The TL:DR is, you need to be a high performer.**¬†High performers take on more responsibility, get more senior positions, and ultimately deliver higher value. And that‚Äôs what ultimately drives a sustained upwards trajectory in your salary that lasts for decades.

If you‚Äôre an average (or below average) performer, and you keep on asking your manager every year for an above-average salary increment, you‚Äôre just going to frustrate your manager.

Don‚Äôt forget to constantly develop yourself and perform better than the day before.

# Principles of salary negotiations

No matter the process you take, the principles below are what I believe are true in all salary negotiations.

**Understand the process.**¬†If you don‚Äôt understand the process and play the game, you‚Äôre trying to swim against the current. That‚Äôs why I wrote the previous¬†[post on how companies decide employee salaries](https://thewealthmeta.com/salary-series-part-2-unpacking-company-salaries-and-bonuses/).

**Pre-read before meetings.**¬†The bigger the stakes, the more important it is to send a pre-read before a meeting. Pre-read is giving upfront information/documentation ahead of the upcoming meeting to allow the audience to digest the information and prepare for it. This allows the audience not to be caught off-guard, be informed and prepared before the meeting. You should do the same in salary negotiations. No manager likes being put on the spot when a team member suddenly asks for a salary raise.

**Document everything.**¬†You‚Äôre going to need data points. No one can argue against objective data on results, contributions, and positive feedback from others. If you take the time to document everything immediately throughout the year (and not 3 days before you have the meeting), you‚Äôre going to have a mountain of data to justify your promotion that will be hard to argue against.

**Timing matters.**¬†You don‚Äôt ask for a raise when the company (and the economy) is struggling. You also need to find the best timings to schedule meetings with your manager. The right conditions are 1) The company is performing well, 2) You are performing well and have just achieved a milestone, and 3) Your manager is also in good standing at work.

**Be professional, polite and positive**. Your manager is not going to react well to direct/veiled threats. The uncomfortable truth of the workplace is that everyone is replaceable, including you. So why burn bridges?

**Make it easier for your manager.**¬†Your manager either has to justify your raise to their manager or ask someone higher up the ladder for approval. Make it easier for your manager by 1) removing barriers, 2) creating materials to easily communicate your proposal (see Business case later on)

**Show future commitment.**¬†Most people justify salary increases based on past performance. The more compelling narrative is to justify a salary raise based on what you can deliver in the future. Why would a manager agree to a raise if they don‚Äôt know if you‚Äôll stick around in the next 6 months?

**Use annual gross salaries.**¬†This shows your business acumen. Fully loaded employee expenses are typically 1.5x ‚Äì 2.0x of gross annual salaries (because of insurance, office space, equipment, other benefits, etc). The layperson thinks in terms of a monthly base salary. Leaders and business-savvy people think in terms of the total package. You know your cost to the business, you can quantify the ROI of salary increases versus the value you bring. Gross means annual salaries, including employer EPF and allowances (exclude bonuses, include ‚Äú13th month salary‚Äù). If you stick to a mindset of monthly base salaries, you potentially leave money on the table, i.e. higher employee EPF contributions, allowances, and also big picture thinking from a PF perspective.

# The salary negotiation process

Alright! Let‚Äôs get into the nitty gritty of it. Another disclaimer here, many are going to think this is way too much work, and that it‚Äôs not worth it. But then again, above-average performers put in the work and get better salary raises. How badly do you want it?

https://preview.redd.it/vrsk0t20hhif1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=54c76138040537135c1625878ca4bdb7ab48238b

**Step 1**:¬†**Investigate processes**

This is super important. Uncover the detailed salary policies and processes for your company. You need to tailor your approach to how your company manages the process. Don‚Äôt fight against the current; work with it.

Where and how do you find this information?

* **Search internal HR policies and documentation.**¬†This would be on your company intranet/portal and sometimes even part of an employee handbook. If you‚Äôre lucky, the whole process might be explicit and transparent
* **HR announcements and emails.**¬†Before performance reviews, you‚Äôll normally receive emails and updates on how the process works, along with key dates.
* **Chat with your team members/colleagues**. Many people are willing to share information about their salaries, experiences and insights. If you‚Äôre lucky, you can get a lot of insights, especially with more senior/experienced colleagues who might share with you data points that can help you argue your case for a salary increase (such as what they‚Äôre earning, what are typical salary increments, which managers are receptive to it, etc)
* **Make friends with HR and Finance.**¬†These two departments are key. If you have friends / close colleagues in Finance, you‚Äôll know in greater detail what the annual budget planning key dates are, how the employee expense budgets are shaping up for next year (e.g. 5% increase to total pool), and senior management‚Äôs sentiment on the company performance. If you build relationships with HR, you might even get snippets on what the grade levels are like for your level (and above you), or even who the actual decision makers are for salary increases, etc.
* **Ask your direct manager**. You‚Äôre in good standing with your manager, right? You‚Äôre a good performer, have good rapport, and have regular fortnightly 1-on-1 catch-ups, right? So go ahead and ask your manager, ‚ÄúHow does the salary review process work here?‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not in good standing with your manager, maybe you should be working on that first before even thinking of asking for a raise
* **Connect with previous employees.**¬†Know someone who used to work at your company? They might be willing to be more open and transparent, as there‚Äôs less risk of any consequences for them sharing information with you

**Step 2: Initial discussion and alignment**

You‚Äôve developed an understanding of how the game is played at your current company; now it‚Äôs time to plant the seeds and set things in motion. If you haven‚Äôt asked your manager how salary reviews and increments work at your current company, this is an excellent way to broach the topic of a salary raise.

How do you go about it? Well, before your next 1-on-1, send a note to your manager with your usual pre-wire updates, at least 2-3 days beforehand (pre-wiring in general is such an underrated move, I should write a whole article about it).

Something like this:

>

This gives your manager the time and space to gather thoughts and react accordingly in the meeting. Contrast this with ‚Äúambushing‚Äù your manager during the performance review period; your manager would highly appreciate it if you brought this up beforehand.

In the meeting itself, you would ask questions to get better clarity on the process, close any gaps in your understanding, and most importantly, to test the waters. Some key points to broach during the meeting, once your questions about the salary review process have been answered:

>

As you can see, this is not the meeting where you already know how much you want (although you may have a number in mind). You don‚Äôt know if your manager hates people asking for raises. You don‚Äôt know what the barriers are in the process. Your immediate objective is to see how your manager reacts and use that to prep for the next discussion.

Some managers may want to see if you already have a number in mind, which I would say:

>

If your manager reacts badly to this meeting, you know you‚Äôre not in good standing, and you might want to consider your prospects in that team (or company).

If your manager is neutral, e.g. proposes to revisit salary discussions closer to the performance review cycle, it‚Äôs still alright. You‚Äôve flagged upfront your intentions, and you can skip the next steps (3 & 4).

Ideally, you would have received some feedback during the meeting that you can use to propose targets at the next 1-on-1 on what you need to achieve to get a salary raise. A simple 1-pager with bullet points articulating¬†[SMART goals](https://thewealthmeta.com/how-smart-are-your-financial-goals/)¬†should do.

The best time to do this is at the beginning of the financial year, during the KPI setting season. As you‚Äôre setting up your KPIs with your manager, it‚Äôs opportune because you can set the typical targets, but also stretch targets to get that salary increase.

**Step 3: Agree on written targets**

Based on the initial discussion and other pieces of information, develop a draft one-pager or bullet points in an email of what you propose as targets to achieve to get a raise. Send that to your manager a few days before your next 1-on-1, similar to step 2.

In your 1-on-1, you refine the targets and hopefully get an agreement/understanding that your manager will increase your salary above the baseline (meaning, the basic inflation salary increment all employees will receive).

Your manager might ask how much you expect to receive as part of the agreement. Your manager may not. My suggestion is to reemphasise what I suggested in Step 2.

Once you agree on the targets, save the document with your targets and send it to your manager. This is important to ensure that the agreement is locked in.

**Step 4: Document everything**

Note: Some company KPI targets have base and stretch goals. Whether you align the stretch goal KPIs to the targets for getting your salary raise is up to you.

Again. Document everything. I have an email folder in my inbox titled ‚ÄúFeedback‚Äù. Every praise, every milestone achieved, every performance result worth documenting goes in there. Every report/dashboard that is related to your outputs should go in there.

Outside of that email folder, every few weeks or every month, block out time to gather data on your projects and daily tasks. How well you‚Äôve performed versus your targets AND in comparison with your colleagues (yes, working life is competitive). Keep track of it in your performance file, a.k.a. detailed CV. It‚Äôs like a lengthy journal of accomplishments; it will also serve you well when looking for a new job. I‚Äôll cover it in more detail in a future post about job hopping.

All the information you gather will be important in creating the business case that you forward to your manager when asking for the raise.

**Step 5: Check-in and iterate**

You‚Äôre still having fortnightly check-ins, right? Every month or two, take the opportunity to discuss your progress towards hitting those targets and also receive feedback so you can improve. Continue documenting and getting alignment so that you know you‚Äôre on the right track.

In a 1 on 1 check-in that coincides with budget season, remind your manager of the agreed plan, and get a deeper pulse check on how your manager views your performance.

**Step 6: Deliver on agreed targets**

I don‚Äôt need to tell you how you‚Äôre going to excel at your job and deliver above expectations. That‚Äôs up to you!

**Step 7: Communicate achievements**

Sometimes your manager may not even know the extent of the hard work you‚Äôve put in, and sometimes they may not even know the outcomes or results of your efforts. This is where the extroverts and people who promote (brag) about themselves shine. You need to be comfortable with promoting yourself.

Now there is one other person who it‚Äôs even more important to promote yourself to. It is the decision maker who is highly likely to be your manager‚Äôs manager. Does he/she know who you are? What have you achieved? The value do you bring to the company? Do you have a good relationship with him/her? If the answer is no to all these questions, why would that person approve your salary raise, even if your manager fights for you?

The simplest way to promote yourself to your manager‚Äôs manager is to have a coffee catch-up with them. In that meeting, be curious but also subtly reveal what you have been doing and achieved, and heap praise on your manager. Bring up how you enjoy working at the company, how you want to deliver more impact and more value, etc.

**Step 8: Build network and political capital**

How is this relevant to your salary raise, you may ask? Many companies have 360 feedback loops for each employee as part of performance reviews. But even if not, the more advocates and ‚Äúsponsors‚Äù you have in the company, the more people you have to vouch for you via ‚Äúback channels‚Äù.

This becomes especially important if performance reviews undergo calibration among managers across the company. Other managers whom you don‚Äôt report to may vouch for you in these calibration meetings. When I was in consulting, it was quite typical for us to approach as many ‚Äúseniors‚Äù above us, all the way to partner level, to support our promotions/reviews in these meetings. I‚Äôve also been a manager who has vouched for other employees in these discussions.¬†

**Step 9: Develop business case**

What is a business case? It‚Äôs a general term to describe a document that articulates a proposal or pitch, with justifications clearly articulated (typically in the form of an ROI).

Developing a business case is crucial to getting the best outcome. Why? It shows black and white proof with all the research and analysis proving you deserve a raise, eliminating any objections in the process.

It can be in the form of a Word document or PowerPoint slides. Whatever suits your style. What‚Äôs important is putting it in writing.

Your business case would have the following components (along with examples of ‚Äúwhat good looks like‚Äù).

**Context.**¬†Recap previous discussions and the agreement between you and your manager. Don‚Äôt forget to include ‚Äú**The Ask**‚Äú, being the specific amount of raise you‚Äôre asking for.

Something like the slide below:

https://preview.redd.it/o2m8p913hhif1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=bc39a7cb7613fe8e6a311df0fe60734436d255e2

**Justifications.**¬†Technically, the example above had the justifications already. But in the following section, you would expand the justifications in more detail. You also need to show evidence for each point. Some examples of types of justifications:

* Achieved previously agreed targets for a salary increase (as per step 3)
* Delivered exceptional value above BAU targets, totalling \[XX\] for the company, contributing \[XX\] in revenue and \[YY\] in cost savings
* Performance in the top 25th percentile across comparable roles in the company (relative to peers)
* Underpaid relative to internal and external benchmarks
* Position assumed higher responsibilities over time compared to the original role responsibilities

The slide below shows how you could translate your achievements into quantitative benefits (which would ideally be more than the raise you‚Äôre asking for):

The example below is a sample slide outlining how the responsibilities of your role might have expanded from when you first started in the role. Don‚Äôt forget to quantify how much additional tasks, time and effort are spent because of the increase in responsibilities.

Showing data points showing how your salary stacks up versus other comparable roles is extremely powerful. It‚Äôs a lot better than just verbalising ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done market research and I think I‚Äôm 20% underpaid‚Äù.

Research salaries on Glassdoor, MalaysianPAYGAP, recruitment firm salary reports, job portal salary reports, etc. Also, do include links/screenshots in the appendix for proof of these salaries, for which you compare your current and proposed salaries.

**Stakeholder feedback.**¬†Show comments/feedback from others/champions, which validates your performance and how much that ‚Äústakeholders across the company and customers recognise and value what I deliver‚Äù.

https://preview.redd.it/fq7hudk7hhif1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=755bd4c86ae2280dc71a51e03b57235dff80e7ff

**Plans to deliver additional value.**¬†You need to show that you are committed to the company and are not a flight risk. You need to show them that it is worth investing in you and granting that salary increase.

So what do you do?

* You identify new opportunities to deliver value, eg more process improvements, will take on more responsibility, etc., and propose that you take them on in the future.
* You emphasise that you want to be involved in key projects and be a significant contributor to the success of the company, so you have aligned interests and show even more commitment

Something like below:

https://preview.redd.it/cpzm22f8hhif1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d4ef2f04f489af28cd1fe4bbefdb11c97dc6a0

**Appendix.**¬†Include any additional supporting documentation/evidence as necessary to back up your case.

**Step 10: Meeting preparation**

You‚Äôve got the business case, now you need to make sure it is bulletproof. Three key ways to prepare to land the negotiation:

1. **Ask someone to review your business case.**¬†A friend, a mentor, or your partner can help. No errors, nothing too aggressive or rude. Always worth having a second pair of eyes to spot any gaps or issues.
2. **Practice by role-playing.**¬†Similar to practising for interviews, have someone role-play your manager and so you can rehearse your key talking points
3. **Send the pre-read**. Send your business case as a pre-read to your manager before the meeting where you will discuss your business case. A few days to a week before. This gives time and space to your manager to carefully consider the business case, and he/she will respect you for that (in addition to being impressed at the amount of due diligence you have put into your business case)

**Step 11: Business case presentation**

This can be daunting for many people, especially if it‚Äôs your first time. The good news is, you‚Äôve done all the legwork throughout the year and emailed a pre-read. As a reminder, the pre-read gives your manager space to think, and makes the conversation easier to manage.

Be confident, assertive, yet collaborative and polite. An example flow and scripts for how to carry the conversation are below. Do ensure you rehearse this as part of Step 10 Preparation.

**Cover key points**

>

**Re-emphasise commitment to the company**

>

**Share that you‚Äôre happy for your manager to forward the document to whoever is part of the review/approval process**

>

**Seek open-ended feedback from your manager**

>

**Pitch it like a collaborative effort, remove blockers**

>

**Step 12: Objection handling**

If you‚Äôve done the work and your justifications are valid, there should be fewer chances of pushback from your manager.

However, it can still occur more likely than not. You can only show your worth and try to influence the decision. Some additional tips

* Use open-ended language (avoid yes or no questions)
* Empathise with your manager (who may be in a difficult spot), reframe the conversation to be collaborative, e.g. ‚ÄúWhat could we do together to solve this challenge?‚Äù
* Focus on using calibrated questions, e.g. ‚ÄúHow does this sound to you?‚Äù

I won‚Äôt plagiarise too much, so I recommend reading this article titled ‚Äú[Asking for a raise? Here‚Äôs what a hostage negotiator would do](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/teamwork/how-to-ask-for-a-raise)‚Äù for some of the best negotiation tactics using collaborative, unthreatening language. No point regurgitating a post that has better information and experience than I do on the topic.

**Step 13: Outcome**

If you receive the raise you requested, congratulations! Be appreciative, thank your manager and celebrate!

If you were rejected or received less than you asked for, accept it gracefully. Again, be polite, professional and positive. Ask your manager, ‚ÄúWhat can I do to get the raise next year?‚Äù. This demonstrates grace, commitment, openness to collaboration, and, most importantly, the ability to manage expectations that you‚Äôll continue the negotiations in the next annual cycle.

# What you should never do when negotiating

**Use personal reasons as a justification.**¬†Your manager and company are not responsible for your personal commitments and circumstances. It‚Äôs unprofessional to use guilt and a sad story to try to appeal for a raise.

**Discussing your salary raise potential at every single check-in**. Focus on delivering value, i.e. performance and improving from feedback. Don‚Äôt be needy.

**Threaten to find another job**. Most people don‚Äôt respond well to threats. Especially when every employee is fungible and replaceable.

**Get the raise and then quit**. This is just extremely bad etiquette.

**Propose a salary range**. Always be specific. It shows that you are confident and have done the work to ascertain your value. Plus, if you give a range, why would the decision makers give you anything less than the minimum of the range you proposed?

**Use a colleague‚Äôs salary as a justification to increase your salary**. You found out your colleague is being paid more than you. A lot more. You‚Äôre envious. It‚Äôs not fair. You raise it as a point. It‚Äôs not going to end well. There could be a multitude of reasons why your colleague is paid more (even though they are a much better performer than you). Don‚Äôt open up a can of worms or Pandora‚Äôs box. You might not like what you see. Play the game.

# FAQ

**Not all roles have quantifiable metrics that can translate to dollars and cents**

I‚Äôd wager 95% of job responsibilities can be quantified into metrics and compared. Examples:

* **HR**¬†‚Äì Average time to hire of 2 months from job posting request to signing of offer letter across 50 hires, 20% faster than department average, with 100% offer acceptance rate (vs 95% department average)
* **Software engineer**¬†‚Äì Shipped 30% more commits than team average, with 20% fewer defects identified during code review and test phases
* **Nurse**¬†‚Äì Patient-to-nurse care ratio 20% above ward average, with a 0.001% medication error rate vs the hospital average of 0.008%
* **Graphic designer**¬†‚Äì Delivered creative outputs consistently 2-3 days before SLAs (30% higher efficiency), resulting in a productivity uplift of 20% additional client deliverables

And once you can quantify, you can convert that to cost savings (hours saved to salary cost) or revenue uplift (additional sales or yield from your contributions).

**Won‚Äôt sending a pre-read to my manager give them time to come up with counter-arguments?**

Sure. But if your business case has gaps and counterpoints to begin with, that just means your business case isn‚Äôt strong, and maybe the raise isn‚Äôt justified.

**Some of these steps seem over the top, like having an agreement on stretch targets or developing a business case document. Isn‚Äôt it too presumptuous / try hard?**

I‚Äôm outlining a comprehensive step-by-step salary negotiation process based on ‚Äúwhat good looks like‚Äù.

Most people don‚Äôt even ask for a salary raise. And out of those that do, are underprepared for it. What makes you think putting in less effort than I described will get you that raise?

Of course, there‚Äôs an element of what‚Äôs suitable based on your specific situation (e.g. if you just got promoted, don‚Äôt go discussing a potential raise in the next cycle). Use your best judgment.

# Wrapping up

Salary raise negotiations aren‚Äôt easy, and there‚Äôs no guarantee you‚Äôll get the raise you want.

If you feel that you‚Äôre not getting raises because you‚Äôve reached the ceiling for that grade level (or some other reason), perhaps it‚Äôs time to¬†**get a promotion or job hop**.

Which are the next two topics for my upcoming posts in this Salary Series. Stay tuned!

The emphasis I sing it with in my head makes it work flow wise but that might be wishful thinking so lmk what u think! I wrote most of this raw mid breakdown with only necessary fixing after, just for context.

Called *I can't control them*:

[Verse 1 - soft, slow]
i cry and i cry and i cry a million times
and i don‚Äôt even know why
but i‚Äôm still crying
so i blast the music to let me feel it
let it out ‚Äòcause i can‚Äôt bear it
don‚Äôt know why
i‚Äôm always crying

[Pre-Chorus - building up]
always at the worst times
when i think i‚Äôm o-kay
i feel myself spiral
down like a staircase
makeup smearing
face is heating ... up
think it won‚Äôt get better
feels like it won‚Äôt ever

[Chorus - begin with beat drop, sung fast]
but it dries up when i need it
then suddenly i stop feelin'
tear up at the worst times
thinkin' im losing my mind
what‚Äôs this thing playing with me
makin' me feel like i‚Äôm crazy
i know everyone has emotions
so why cant i just control them


[Verse 2 - slower]
i‚Äôm tired, so tired
i wake up, i‚Äôm tired
coffee gets me wired
scared that i‚Äôll get fired
or that i‚Äôll fail
i‚Äôm tired, so tired
i go out, i‚Äôm a liar
i get home and i‚Äôm tired
hurts if u do or dont inquire ... how i am

[Bridge]
my mind only wakes up when in bed
then i can‚Äôt seem to empty my head
it spins around in circles
black and blue and purple
tells me everything goes wrong
and i just get dragged along

[Verse 3 - middle speed]
i love and i laugh and i cry
but sometimes there‚Äôs nothing inside
feels like a black hole
trying to take over all ... of me
but then i get past it
everyone is with me laughing
smile 'cause i'm happy
life of the party
overwhelmingly content ... then i'm crashing

[ Final Chorus - full intensity]
so it leaves just when i need it
then suddenly i stop feelin'
no smile though i'm fine
think I'm losing my mind
what‚Äôs this thing playing with me
making me feel like i‚Äôm crazy
i know everyone has emotions
so why cant i just control them

[Outro - fading out]
i can‚Äôt control them
cant control them

I was there for six months, and he arrived around my second or third month. He was super nice, and since we were from the same country, talking to him felt natural and easy.

Over the next few months, we grew closer while hanging out with others from the house. I introduced him to my school friends, and he became part of our group. Sometimes I felt he was trying to get closer physically ‚Äî holding my hand, little touches ‚Äî but I was scared. I had never kissed anyone before.

One night, after getting home late, he knocked on my bedroom door to talk. I let him in, and when I sat on the bed, he leaned in to kiss me. I said no ‚Äî not because I didn‚Äôt want to, but because the girl I shared a bathroom with (we weren‚Äôt close, but she was nice) had a crush on him. He seemed a little frustrated but was understanding and left after we talked.

That night, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about him. He was the first person to make me feel something real. He wanted me, and I felt like I deserved to be happy. Plus, he didn‚Äôt feel the same way about her, and that was okay.

The next day, I asked him to meet me at the park. I told him I liked him too but admitted I‚Äôd never kissed anyone before. He was so chill about it, said things that made me feel safe and comfortable ‚Äî and then we kissed.

After that, I would sneak into his room almost every night to make out. I fell in love hard. He looked at me like I was the most wonderful thing he‚Äôd ever seen. He made me feel confident in my body, calmed my anxious mind, and made me feel loved and at peace.

Months later, it was time for him to return home, while I still had two months left abroad. We kept in touch every day, counting the days until we could see each other again.

When I finally returned to my country in early 2020, I decided to visit him in his city before going home to mine. It felt so good to see him, kiss him again, and be together ‚Äî even though it was just for a few hours. Not long after, the pandemic hit, and we began a long-distance relationship for almost a year. We made plans to travel together, maybe even move back to the country where we met and build a life just the two of us.

But over time, things started to change. I was afraid to tell my father about him, and I think that was unfair to him. By mid-2021, we decided to break up but remain friends.

We didn‚Äôt talk for months. I missed him every single day. He muted my Instagram stories, probably to forget me, and even though I understood, it hurt.

In September that year, I returned to his city for an English test. I met up with old friends, including him. One night, after being out drinking with the group, I couldn‚Äôt sleep and sat in the hallway of the hotel. He came to sit beside me, and I just started crying. He hugged me, we talked about the past few months, and we kissed again.

For the next few days, we were together, but it wasn‚Äôt the same. One night at his house, with his whole family there, he didn‚Äôt even introduce me. It felt like I wasn‚Äôt important to him. We tried to be intimate, but in the middle, he said things felt different and that his feelings had changed. I stopped, agreed, and later went back to my friend‚Äôs place.

Before I left the city, we talked at the park about life and what had happened while we weren‚Äôt speaking. I still cared for him deeply and thought we could at least remain friends. But after a few months of occasional meme exchanges, he blocked me.

That crushed me. I kept wondering if I‚Äôd done something wrong, if I could have helped him somehow. But eventually, I realized he just didn‚Äôt want me in his life, and I wasn‚Äôt going to shrink myself to fit where I wasn‚Äôt wanted.

Months later, he messaged me, apologizing. He said he‚Äôd been dealing with personal issues, had distanced himself from friends, and even blocked me to ‚Äúwork on himself,‚Äù but that he had unblocked me ‚Äúout of friendship.‚Äù

That hurt ‚Äî because shortly after, in another conversation, when I told him I wouldn‚Äôt let him come and go from my life whenever he wanted, he said:

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to come back to your life. That‚Äôs not what I meant.‚Äù

That contradiction marked me deeply. If unblocking me was ‚Äúout of friendship,‚Äù how could he then say he didn‚Äôt want to come back into my life at all?

At some point in 2022, I moved to his city, but we weren‚Äôt in touch. Then last November, he followed me on Instagram. I followed back, and a few days later, he messaged asking how life was and if I wanted to meet at the park. I said no, that I didn‚Äôt think there was anything to talk about. He said that was fine and that if I ever wanted to grab a coffee, I could let him know.

Since then, I haven‚Äôt been able to stop thinking about him. I started psychotherapy after our breakup because losing him destroyed me. Even without contact, in the past few months I followed his work as a photographer and felt happy for him ‚Äî I could see his passion in it.

Two months ago, he unfollowed me again. And yet, I still think about him constantly. I‚Äôve never allowed myself to open up to someone else the way I did with him. I think I‚Äôve never stopped loving him.

I wonder if I should message him, maybe to finally get closure or to see if we‚Äôve both grown enough to try again. But I‚Äôm also scared ‚Äî scared he‚Äôll tell me again that he doesn‚Äôt feel the same, scared to relive the heartbreak. 

I know I wasn‚Äôt perfect in this relationship either. I made mistakes, and I don‚Äôt blame him for everything that happened between us. Over the years, I‚Äôve worked on myself a lot ‚Äî trying to understand who I was back then, who I am now, and the patterns and problems we both brought into the relationship. Looking back, I see that it wasn‚Äôt only his fault. It just hurts that even with all this growth, I still carry the weight of how things ended and how his words made me feel.

Part of me thinks I should just let go, focus on therapy, and move on. Another part wonders if meeting could be the closure I need‚Ä¶ or the start of something new.

So, Reddit ‚Äî here‚Äôs where I need your perspective:

	‚Ä¢	Would it be stupid to message him?
       ‚Ä¢    Should I truly let him go for good?
	‚Ä¢	Or should I hear what he wanted to say the last time he asked to meet?


TL;DR: Met a guy at 18 while abroad. First love, deep emotional connection. Did long-distance, broke up, but he came in and out of my life multiple times. He once said he unblocked me ‚Äúout of friendship,‚Äù then later told me he didn‚Äôt want to come back to my life ‚Äî this contradiction really hurt and confused me. Moved to his city, barely spoke. He recently followed and unfollowed me again. I still think about him constantly, never opened up to anyone else the same way, and I‚Äôm torn between reaching out for closure or letting him go forever.

This one is 8 years old and finished in a port style wine cask (this is the bottle that made me understand wine cask whisky).

Non chill filtered, natural color, 54.2% ABV, Paid $104USD

Nose:  raspberry and dark chocolate, definite yet subtle oak presence, ripe apple, it's all very sweet and delicate, the longer you live in it the chocolate turns into coffee.

Palate:  it continues seamlessly from the nose, rich creamy coffee, vanilla, berries and plums, heavily roasted malt.  Again very sweet, but not overly so.  It's also quite syrupy despite the relatively low proof.

Finish: that roasted maltyness and fruitiness continue into the finish, dark coffee and berries, lingers for longer than you'd think.

This goes head to head with any single malt from anywhere in the world. This might be my absolute favorite bottling. The way this spirit and cask come together are absolutely amazing and a unique experience.

1mnwhgl,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mnwhgl/i_m24_want_to_reignite_an_old_relationship/,I (M24) want to re-ignite an old relationship without crossing boundaries with my current girlfriend (F24),"Throwaway because my friends know my main account.

Here‚Äôs the situation: I‚Äôve been in a relationship with my ex-girlfriend for 2.5 years, from 2017-2020. We were high school sweethearts, first love type of thing. She was head over heels for me and so was I. In 2020, beginning of covid I ended things between us. Covid was extra hard because I regretted that decision a few weeks after, but I still thought it was the right decision.  
  
Fast-forward to today. I‚Äôm now 24 so is she, she has been in a relationship for 4.5 years and I have been in a relationship for 1.5 years now. For nearly 10 months, I‚Äôve had the temptation to text her. I haven‚Äôt been able to fully understand my intentions of texting her, but I want to see her and catch up. When we parted ways, we were both starting university and so much has happened since then. I knew university was uncertainty for her and I‚Äôd like to know what she‚Äôs doing. I think I know deep down what my desire is, and I am just hoping she feels the same way tbh.  
  
Why haven‚Äôt I texted her when I was single like 2 years ago? I think I grew up between that time, learned why I really left her, and it wasn‚Äôt because I fell out of love, but I think it‚Äôs more about the fact that I had FOMO and the desire to live the way my friends were, go out, experience, meet other people etc. I‚Äôve always been a big nostalgic and FOMO person, and I think it‚Äôs playing a part here. Maybe it‚Äôs even just nostalgia about her.  
  
There are a few things that have happened in the last year that enabled this desire. First, my mom and she texted each other because they met a mutual and anyway, she texted my mom. My mom told me that she ended the message saying she hopes they meet once again. Maybe I‚Äôm reading too much into things here. Also, I talk a fair bit with my current girlfriend about her because she brings it up a lot, I don‚Äôt. She thinks it‚Äôs sweet because she is my first love and has no resentment towards this person just because she‚Äôs my ex. My girlfriend thinks it‚Äôs cute the way I‚Äôm talking about her and that I‚Äôve never said anything negative about this ex-girlfriend. She says she thinks my ex-girlfriend was ‚Äúthe one‚Äù for me. That struck a chord. Finally, I talked with my mom about my feelings about this yesterday, and my mom always loved this girl. She told me she and my ex-girlfriend‚Äôs mother always thought that we met too young and if we met now, we would have made it until the end. Of course that made me sad, and I think I feel the same way somehow.  
  
Now I just don‚Äôt know what to do. I want to write to her, invite her for a coffee to talk. You know, that could bring me closure, maybe, but I don‚Äôt think deep down it‚Äôs really what I am after. I know that if I don‚Äôt text her, I will always regret it and it will be my ‚Äúwhat if‚Äù. I‚Äôm young and I kinda want to just say fuck it and do it. If I wasn‚Äôt in a relationship, I would‚Äôve done it already. But here I am, in a relationship, I know that if I want to write to her, I need to have a talk with my current girlfriend. I wouldn‚Äôt want to hurt her, but I feel that is what would be best for me, maybe it‚Äôs selfish. If I didn‚Äôt write to her, I would feel like it would be emotionally cheating. My girlfriend and I have had an eventful first year together, and honestly, I have a hard time imagining her living her life with someone else, or even maybe with me.

I want you to know I am in pain.
Perhaps you'll find it in your heart,
To help a new connection start.

1mnwfmi,https://i.redd.it/fute1tgdzhif1.jpeg,Ground scored pizza and good company (story),"I was walking to 7-Eleven for hot water and coffee while coming up with a new song, when some guy stopped me and asked for a song. A song turned into a walk and a talk, and then next thing I knew, he was walking me me all the way to the 7-Eleven. On the way, I found some kettle corn and a pizza box with 3 slices of veggie pizza in it, and he drunkenly talked about life and his hard day while failing to tie the kettle corn bag the whole time. Eventually, a walk and talk there turned into a walk and talk back, and it was made clear we both needed the company. About half way back to my camp, I casually mentioned needing to fill up my water jug so I could take a bird bath‚Äîto which he led us through one or two cuts through the streets, and before I could even realize, we were suddenly at his place. It was supposed to be just a few minutes, enough to fill a one gallon jug with water‚Äîbut good conversations rarely can manage that. 

""I don't need a whole lot of water, I just wanna take a shower and water my dog"", I said
""I would love to let you use my shower dude... But I just met you""
""Nah you're all good, that's not what I meant‚ÄîI've mastered bird baths. I meant a little under a gallon of luke warm sink water is more than enough""

We walked through the doorway‚Äîone of those San Francisco doorways that hides between small, tall shops that juxtapose the rest of that particular street so well it all just becomes one. It seems the only time you can really see these doors is at night is when there's no people running around like distracting ants‚Äîor maybe only when you're led to them. We crept up steep creaking stairs as the air began to smell like dust and the cold remains of somebody's late dinner, opposed to the wannabe petrichoir the ocean fog spills over the city every night. We walked in, and I awkwardly found the first seat and sat. It's always a little awkward going into a random stranger's house. Despite happening pretty frequently as a traveler, it's never not a little odd. Silence filled the room only briefly, while we both stared at my busted jug as it was getting filled for some reason. 

""Hey dude... Do you want eggs?"", he broke the silence
""Hell yeah, I love eggs""
""Do you like... Cheese? 
""Who doesn't?""

So he capped my jug and pulled out eggs and two slices of Kraft cheese, threw my groundscored pizza in the oven, and got to work. We conversed more, talking about birthdays and family and music and death‚Äîall of it‚Äîso much so that his roommate came in to tell us to shut up. We didn't. He served me over easy eggs with delicious hot sauce, hot floor pizza in a Ziploc bag, and he asked if I needed a glass for my water.

""I'm all good, I live off of coffee. The water is really just for my dog and a birdbath""
""Dude I really would let you use my shower... I love helping people out, and you're a good kid""
""Nah man it's all good""
""It's just... I'm involved with somebody. I don't want it to seem...""
""Hell yeah, me too. I totally get ya""
...
""Let me good you a towel. But after this... Goodnight""

And like that, I was taking a hot shower with a full belly‚Äîlife's good. And like all showers I get, I had my pepper spray on the shower rack, above my bandana hanging off. Thank goodness I've never had to use it in the shower. When I got out of the bathroom, I was expecting to leave immediately‚Äîbut he seemed a little more sober and excited to continue hanging out. He immediately invited me into the other room, to which he clearly saw my hesitation when I asked ""You tryna jam?"". He said yes, which might have actually reassured both of us once again. I think we both really just needed some good company from a random stranger. His living room looked like a desert dwelling hippie kid's dream‚Äîit was awesome. Lots of plants‚Äîmostly cacti, contrasting colors, and meaningful, unique decorations. We sat on his couch and he pulled out his guitar‚ÄîI pulled out my baritone ukulele. It started with just a song or two, then suddenly we had danced with our instruments and souls all the way through dawn.

""I really needed this dude... I had a rough day""
""Same. Thanks for asking for a song and walking with me... And everything else""
""If we made a band, would it be called over easy eggs?""
""Haha... Sure""

We rudely forgot about his roommate for a bit‚Äîsinging and playing like our lives depended on it. Maybe they did that night, when we both bumped into each other on that cold and lonely street. San Francisco is deceiving‚Äîsometimes it's hard to tell if it's 6 pm, 2 am, or 6 am. But it was 6 am, and it was time for me to go. He gave me some wool socks, we exchanged words of genuine appreciation and well wishes, and I was off.  

And like that, there's now another stranger intertwined into the threading quilt of my life‚Äîbut only for a beautiful stitch or two. Here's to another fleeting moment to keep me warm at night.",21,1754964804.0,vagabond,2,0.8,False

A/n: (before some/all of you read this, Just letting you know that this was my version of leviathan before leviathan's Cannon design was revealed)

(We start the scene where we see the I.M.P company building was usually at, until we cut to the break room where we see Loona on her phone with her legs on the table and we see Moxxie and Millie, as they enter the break room)

Millie: *sits down* Are you sure you don't want my help hon?

Moxxie: Is fine Millie, *grabs the coffee bag* I can handle it.

(After Moxxie poured the coffee into the filter and filled the water tank, he then pressed the button and waited for the coffee to be done. As he goes towards the fridge and opens the door to get the milk. Suddenly, a giant anchor came crashing through the roof and destroyed the fridge. Then Moxxie, Millie and Loona freak out and run out of the break room. As they did, they peek from the doorway and see the anchor still there)

Moxxie: *whisper* What is that?

Millie: *whisper* It looks like a giant anchor.

Loona: *whisper* But why did it have to land in the break room? 

(As they look at the anchor, blitz√∏ see's the gang and walks towards them)

Blitz√∏: *walking in* Hey hey, what are you guys doing? I don't pay you three standing outside the break room like I do at m&m's place!

Moxxie: What now?

Blitz√∏: Don't worry about it, now get to w-*then he sees the anchor though the ceiling, then he gets angry* WHO THE F*CK DROPPED AN ANCHOR IN MY BUILDING!?

Moxxie: I don‚Äôt know, sir, it just crashed through when I was just making coffee for me and Millie. Which is something we really need to discuss about.

Blitz√∏: *Angry* Who the fuck cares?! What matters is that where the fuck it came from?!

Millie: No idea, *looks at the anchor, until he sees the chain* but my guess is to climb up the chain and find out for ourselves.

Blitz√∏: *rums palms together* Well, I'm gonna get to the bottom of this thing!

Moxxie: Wouldn't that be the top?

(Blitz√∏ looks at Moxxie and he narrows his eyelids, until he starts to climb the chain)

Moxxie: sir, wait! Wait!

(Then Moxxie climbs the chain)

Millie: blitz√∏, hold on! don't go alone!

(Then Millie climbs the chain too)

Loona: *sighs* Why do I even bother? 

(Then Loona started to climb the chain as well, as the gang climbed the chain. They wonder to themselves ‚Äúwhat the hell will the chain end up?‚Äù)

French Narrator: A few inches later‚Ä¶

(We then see the gang still climbing up the chain, though they had what look like beards on their faces)

Millie: Man, this chain is long as hell! And why are we wearing fake beards?

Moxxie: because blitz√∏ made us wear them.

Blitz√∏: I wanted to spice things up. Besides, you didn't want to wear the funny glasses I had.

Moxxie: Sir, i-* looks and points up* Ship!

 Millie: *takes off her face beard* hon, I told you to go before we started our job.

Moxxie: No, look, *points up again* a giant flying ship!

(Then they look up and see Moxxie was right, there was a giant flying ship. This ship had black wood with purple wooden fins on the bottom, a purple serpent head at fount and a purple tail from behind, it has green trim on the back of the neck, on top of the scales and on the tail, it had a purple sail with the symbol from the ‚Äúenvee‚Äù app on the sails with the evil Smirk face symbol on the right side and the Angry face symbol on the left side)

Blitz√∏: Great, Now I can finally give this anchor fucker a piece of my mind!

Millie: I don‚Äôt know blitz√∏, the ship has an ominous emerged green glow around it.

Blitz√∏: Probably because the owner is a lazy ass fuck that can't just do one thing, Now let's go! *start to climb again*

Millie: *climbs up* Blitz√∏! Wait!

(As they kept climbing, they made it to the ship. As blitz√∏ was the first one to climb on board)

Blitz√∏: All right, who owns this tugboat?!

(As Blitz√∏ looks around, he spots a sign saying ‚ÄúOwner‚Äù and walks towards it)

Blitz√∏: *Walks over to the door and knocks on it* Come on out! I wanna file a complaint about your anchor, you piece of shit!

(As blitz√∏ keeps pounding on the door, Moxxie, millie and Loona look around the place. Until she spotted a black flag with a purple envy sigil on it)

Loona: Uh guys, Doesn't this place seem familiar?

Millie: What makes you say that?

Loona: Well, doesn't this ship ring any bells?

(Then blitz√∏ started to ring the doorbell, with a sign saying ‚ÄúRing for questions‚Ä¶.or ye booty‚Äù)

Moxxie: Well, now that you say it. Where have I seen this ship before? 

(As they walk towards blitz√∏, they don't notice a barrel behind them that says ‚Äúproperty of Leviathan''. Blitz√∏ angrily pounds on the door until smoke appears in front of him. As he backs away while coughing, he sees the culprit. Who was a female with a serpent-like body with purple scales and a pink under belly, she had a cobra-like fins with ‚Äúenvee‚Äù symbols on them, wearing half of a mask on their left face, has a light blue fins on their tail, has a light blue fin on their back, had a outfit that looks like a pirate and magician mix together and had a hat that was mix with both pirate and magician as well. As the smoke clears, the culprit was revealed to be none other than the queen of the envy ring herself, leviathan. Or Lucy for short)

Lucy: *Enraged* Who dares disturb' the princess of envy's own ship?!

Moxxie: *scared* I-It's blitz√∏. He wants to complain to you about your ship, Miss leviathan. 

(Then Lucy gives Blitz√∏ an evil look)

Blitz√∏: *scared* I-i...no, I don't.

Millie: *scared* Well, what about all that stuff about ‚Äúher having a dirty ship and being lazy and all‚Äù?

Blitz√∏: *laughs nervously* I-i never said that.

Lucy: Insultin' a demon's ship be worse than insultin' her mother!

Loona: *thinks* Wait, I think you WERE talking about her mother that was dirty, Not her ship.

(Once Loona said that, Lucy uses her hands and zaps lightning at blitz√∏ as he screams)

Blitz√∏: *in pain* ow!

Lucy: *looks at Moxxie & Millie* Ye two are next! 

(Then Moxxie & Millie scream and jump off the ship)

Moxxie: That was a close one! 

(Then they land back on the ship) 

Lucy: Ahoy there!

(Then Moxxie & Millie scream and jump off the ship again)

Millie: That was a closer one! 

(Then they land back on the ship again)

Lucy: Welcome back! 

(Then Moxxie and Millie scream and jump off the ship again, only making blitz√∏ annoyed)

Blitz√∏: *Annoyed* Hey! Wait a fuckin minute, How come when m&m act up, all they get is the welcome wagon? If you ask me, it's‚Ä¶

(But before he could continue, Lucy zaps him)

Lucy: so, are you gonna try that again?

Moxxie: Uhh‚Ä¶

Blitz√∏: *covers moxxie's mouth* No, no, they're not‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶*sighs* Whew.

(But Lucy zaps blitz√∏ again, just for fun)

Blitz√∏: *Angry* OH COME ON!!

Lucy: Alright, that was fun. Now listen *summons a scroll and puts on a monocle* Whosoever sets foot on the great leviathan‚Äôs ship, uninvited or otherwise, shall become members of his ghostly crew forever! *close the scroll* And, uhh *opens the scroll again* Ever. *closes the scroll again*

Blitz√∏: *sarcastic* Gee, Will we be getting business cards?

Lucy: *Demonic voice* Silence! *normal voice* You're part of my crew now, and our job is to sail around and steal from people. It'll be grueling, mind-numbing, and repetitive. Just like... daytime television.

(As Moxxie, millie and Loona think about it. Blitz√∏ was angry of the idea)

Blitz√∏: *Angry* Now you listen here, miss. If you think I'm gonna spend more than five minutes on this dumpster, then you're crazy. I mean, look at this place. It's disgusting! *shows a green jockstrap* Whoever told you that having oil lamps next to hardwood paneling was a good idea-

(Then Lucy was annoyed by Blitz√∏ and picked him up)

Blitz√∏: Oh, oh, now what? I suppose you're gonna show me‚Ä¶

(Then Lucy turns and shows him her treasure chest) 

Blitz√∏: *dollar sign eyes* Is that a treasure chest?

(Then Lucy then opens the treasure chest and drops him in, causing him to scream in horror. As he falls through a void of Demonic and horror versions in terror, Moxxie, millie and Loona look inside and were scared of what happen to blitz√∏)

Lucy: *Smirks, while she close her treasure chest* Would anyone else like to enter the ‚ÄúChest of maddening horror""?

Moxxie: *scared* No! We know our place now, miss leviathan!

Millie: *scared* We'll do anything you say!

Loona: *scared* Just don't throw us in there!

Lucy: *evilly grins* Then, for starters, you can...swab the deck! (hands Moxxie & Millie a mop and a bucket)

Millie: *looks at the mop* Oh, I got a mop!

Moxxie: *looks at the bucket* I'll I got is a bucket.

Lucy: Listen! We're heading down to Pentagram tonight for a little ‚Äúshopping‚Äù spree, so I want this ship to look good and scary!

Moxxie: You mean you want it to look good...and scary. Well, I think we can probably‚Ä¶

Millie: No, no, I think she means she wants it to look so good that it's scary.

Moxxie: Or maybe that by looking so scary you forget that it doesn't look good!

Millie:...Ok, you lost me there.

Moxxie: Look, it's easy, it simply means that‚Ä¶

Lucy: *Demonic voice* GET MOVING!!

(As Lucy scream at them, moxxie and Millie started to sweeping the floor with the mop & bucket)

Moxxie & Millie: *singing, while sweeping with the mop and bucket* A sailor's life is a wonderful life / A wonderful life for sure!

Loona: *to Lucy* Well, what do you want me to do?

Lucy: Well, *looks at Loona with bedroom eyes* came to my quarters and we can talk about it~ *slithers away*

Loona: ‚Ä¶.*gulps, while blushes*

(Montages & song)

(We then cut the outside of the ship, as we go inside and see Moxxie and Millie sitting on a bunk bed. Waiting for lucy)

Moxxie: Why do you think Lucy said we needed to talk?

Millie: I don‚Äôt know, and I haven't seen Loona in awhile. Wonder what she's doing?

(Then Lucy suddenly appeared in the room and took her pirate/magician hat off her head to show she was serious)

Lucy: look, i‚Äôve been thinkin‚Äô This whole crew for eternity thing isn't working out. It's not really you so much as it is me.

Moxxie: So, You're letting us go? 

Lucy: Well, actually, I'm gonna take you both to my ring where I have free reign and hang you both from the gallows. *puts her pirate/magician hat back on* See ya at 8!

(As Lucy disappears, Moxxie & Millie look at where Lucy was and scream in horror)

Millie: Wait, why don't we just leave!? 

Moxxie: But the door is locked and the only way out is through the... *looks at right* perfume department.

(As Moxxie points where the perfumes where at, m&m looks at it for a few minutes and they have decided)

Millie:.....*deep sighs* Let's do it

Moxxie: *gulps*

(One minute later)

(We then see m&m, as they got out of the perfumes department room while they were coughing after being getting sprayed by the perfumes)

Millie: *coughs* I hate that perfume department so much!

Moxxie: *coughs* Why did there have to be so many!?

???: Guys, what are you doing here?

(As they turn their heads, they see Loona. As she was in a purple robe with the ‚Äúenvee‚Äù symbol on the left side of it)

Moxxie: We're getting out of here and-*notice Loona wearing the robe* Why do you have a robe on?

Loona: *blushes*.....uh, don't change the subject fatty! 

(As Moxxie was gonna scream ‚ÄúI'm not fat!‚Äù, Millie heard something from the other side of the room)

Millie: *whisper* Shh, Listen. 

(As the three put their ears on the door, they could hear Lucy talking on the other side. We then cut in Lucy's quarters, as she was writing what looks like her dairy)

Lucy: Dear dairy *Demonic voice* And you better f*cking write back this Time! *normal voice* I told those imps I'm gonna execute them tonight, I bought out my good old executing ax for the occasion. Ahh, it's a good thing I found my executing gloves. Remember the last time I lost my executing gloves? I couldn't kill for a whole month. yes sir, sometimes I wonder how I would survive If anything ever happen to my-*tunes her chair, only to see her executing gloves were gone* WHAT THE?!?!

(As Lucy looks at where her executing gloves were at, she spotted Moxxie, millie and Loona run to the main deck while Moxxie had Lucy's gloves from her window. Angrily, Lucy suddenly appeared in fount of them in her full demon form, which her whole body was big, she had wings behind her back that were massive, she had 3 eyes and her claws are sharp)

Lucy: *full demon form* Give me my gloves back, everyone knows I can't kill without them!

(As Lucy slithers towards Moxxie in her full demon form, millie grabs the gloves and pulls a lighter out)

Millie: You better let us go, or I'll burn your gloves!!

Lucy: *Full demon form* You wouldn't dare!!.....

Millie: *narrow* Try me, b*tch!.....

(As Millie and Lucy narrow their eyes at each other, Moxxie decided to break the silence)

Moxxie: It would seem we have reached an impasse.

Lucy: *turns back to normal* The imp is right. Tell you what. You give me back my gloves, and I'll give you...three wishes.

Moxxie: Wishes? I wish we had known that earlier!

(Then Loona looks at her phone, spotted the clock on Going backwards one minute)

Lucy: Okay, now you got two wishes left.

Loona: *Annoyed* Damn it Moxxie! 

Millie: *thinks* I wish blitz√∏'s was here right now, I wonder where he is right now? 

(We then cut back to blitz√∏, as he was still falling through the chest of maddening horror, until he eventually falls through a hole and crashes into his chair from falling though of his office)

Blitz√∏: *sighs* Man, I'm glad all that's over!

(Then he suddenly disappears, only to reappear on the ship)

Blitz√∏: *looks around* Oh, you have got to be fuckin kidding me!!

Millie: Oh, hey blitz√∏! Lucy gave us three wishes! Moxxie used the first one, and I guess I... *realizing* just used the second one.

Blitz√∏: Then, the last one you owe me because you got me back into this mess!

Moxxie: *Annoyed* You?! You weren't even here when me and Millie did everything! And that wasn't even a wish I asked for! 

Loona: I deserve it, and you don't want to know what I've been through! 

Blitz√∏/Loona/Moxxie/Millie: *arguing*

Lucy: *Demonic voice* That's enough! *normal voice* Using my mystic other-worldly powers, I shall decide who gets the last wish! *uses the eeny-meenie-minie-mo method* Eeny, meeny, miny, mo, catch a sailor by the toe, if he hollers, let him go, my mother told me to pick the very best one and‚Ä¶

Moxxie: *Grabs blitz√∏'s shoulders* Now, think, sir! We're about to get killed. What can you wish for to make it so we don't get killed?

Blitz√∏: *thinks* Hmmmmmmm, *Gets an idea* I know! 

Loona: *Angry* I SWEAR TO FUCK BLITZ√ò, IF YOU SAY ‚ÄúHORSE‚Äù, I WI-!!

Blitz√∏: No Loonay, my wish obviously would be *shouts* FOR THAT STUPID FUCKING ANCHOR NEVER CRASHED THROUGH THE CEILING IN THE BREAK ROOM IN THE FUCKING FIRST PLACE!!

(As blitz√∏ said that, Lucy just Smirks and let's out a seaman's laugh, until she realizes what the wish was)

Lucy: *realized* Oh, fuck me!

(Just then, a light flash before their eyes. We then go back where we see the I.M.P company building was usually at, until we cut to the break room where we see Loona on her phone with her legs on the table and we see Moxxie and Millie, as they enter the break room)

Millie: (sits down) Are you sure you don't want my help hon?

Moxxie: Is fine Millie, (grabs the coffee bag) I can handle it.

(After Moxxie poured the coffee into the filter and filled the water tank, he then pressed the button and waited for the coffee to be done. As he goes towards the fridge and opens the door to get the milk. When suddenly‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶)

Moxxie: *sniffs* Oh my Satan, the milk expired! *shouts to blitz√∏* Sir, We really should go grocery shopping for the break room! 

(Then blitz√∏ entries the break room)

Blitz√∏: Oh Shut it Moxxie, i-*realized* Hey, I'm not the only one getting a feeling that something was supposed to happen. right? 

Loona: *looking at her phone* No.

Moxxie: *pours sugar in his and Millie's coffee* I don't know anything About it sir.

Millie: *shrugs* Beats me.

(Then he walks out of the break room while he hums. As we cut outside of the I.M.P company, we see Lucy's ship from above. As Lucy was banging her head hard against the railing Angrily)

Lucy: *Angry* 3 WISHES?! COME ON LUCY, YOU'RE LOSING YOU'RE EDGE HERE!! *sighs* I hate being a pirate, why am I even one in the fucking first place?!

Hello modding fam,

In collaboration with AndoAndoAndo, we set out with 3 big goals for a new NH34 case:
	1.	Make it the slimmest on the market.
	2.	Make it beginner-friendly for mods.
	3.	Give it an original design that still plays nice with your favorite parts.

Fast forward 6+ months (and more prototypes than cups of coffee we probably should‚Äôve had), and we‚Äôve finally got the finished piece:
	‚Ä¢	Just 11mm thick ‚Äì that‚Äôs with the case back and flat crystal.
	‚Ä¢	No chapter ring ‚Äì because let‚Äôs be honest, nobody enjoys removing a crystal just to swap it. Instead, we laser-engraved the bezel with minute markers.
	‚Ä¢	Tested for compatibility:
	‚Ä¢	Works with all flat SKX007 bezel inserts (picture attached of dial and bezel insert from popular modding sites)
	‚Ä¢	Fits all 28.5 mm dials
	‚Ä¢	Plays nice with 29 mm crystals (hundreds of SEIKO 5 models use them) ‚Äî we‚Äôve got a flat sapphire preinstalled, but if you‚Äôre brave, you can swap in your own.
	‚Ä¢	Straps: Fits most 20mm straps & 20mm flat-end bracelets.

We made 10 limited edition watches using this case to help cover molding fees and kick off mass production. You can check them out now on Ando‚Äôs site.
AndoAndoAndo dot com

We‚Äôre stoked to finally share this and can‚Äôt wait to see what you‚Äôll build with it when start producing it, Feedback, questions, memes ‚Äî all welcome.

(Also, yes, we tested a double-domed crystal in the pics, but the case ships with flat sapphire. Double dome is just showing off.)

in order to make the slimmest GMT case with a rotating bezel we had to make the crystal only 1mm thick and that will make the watch only rated for 5ATM . ‚Äúknowing that people always want higher water resistance rating, while in reality, the majority of them don‚Äôt get into situations that require water resistance above 5 ATM. This is a great example of having a design concept and using reasoning to decide on the details‚Äù Ando‚Äôs words

Finally, those GMT hands are also getting a boost to mass production! They‚Äôll be available in two super luminous colors, printed directly onto the hands. This design will give you that cool vintage fallen lume vibe, but don‚Äôt worry, they‚Äôll still be super bright! I‚Äôll tell you more about that later.

We feel that painting the concrete the same or similar colour as the house would be too much green and may make the house look taller (it's already tall AND on a hill).

Sugar ants and termites disagree,"I used to think my office building was spotless. Janitors clean every night, we have those fancy automatic air fresheners, even the break room smells like a hotel lobby. No reason to worry, right?

Wrong.

A few weeks ago, I noticed a few tiny ants on the kitchen counter near the coffee machine. Just a couple. I squashed them and didn‚Äôt think much of it.

Then I started seeing more. Not a swarm, just 3 or 4 at a time always near the same spot. I mentioned it to the office manager and they shrugged it off: ‚ÄúProbably nothing. Maybe someone spilled sugar.‚Äù

Cut to two weeks later the cabinet under the sink is full of them. Crawling up the sides, behind the pipes, inside unopened boxes of tea. Turns out they were sugar ants, and they‚Äôd made themselves right at home behind the break room wall. And guess what else they found during the inspection?

Termites in the baseboards. On the opposite end of the building.
They‚Äôd apparently been there for months without anyone noticing.

Management had to call in a full extermination crew. Half the staff got temporarily relocated because of the chemicals, and the landlord is now dealing with potential structural damage from a building that looks squeaky clean on the outside.

We've been bootstrapping an agritech startup for the past eight years. We've been fortunate to be incubated by IITs and IIMs and have successfully closed grants. Last year, we hit a major milestone with around ‚Çπ1 crore in revenue.

Now, we're at an exciting inflection point where demand for our product is far greater than our current supply capabilities. Our bootstrapped funds are no longer enough to support this growth, and we're ready to scale.

We're looking for a highly motivated individual to join us and lead our fundraising efforts for an angel round of ‚Çπ4-5 crores. This person will work directly with me and be comfortable with modern CRM and outreach tools.

What we offer:

 * Initial compensation: ‚Çπ5k-‚Çπ10k per month, based on skills and input.
 * Post-funding: Upon successful closure of the round, this role will evolve into a full-time position in the Founder's Office with a compensation of ‚Çπ6-10 LPA, plus ESOPs.

Who we're looking for:
 * Someone with fundraising experience or a background from an Ivy League institution.
 * We're also open to connecting with potential angel investors who might be interested in our space.

I always think about our first date. When we asked eachother at the same time, ‚Äúdid I know you in a past life??‚Äù It was so shocking and so funny. It must have been true. 

I hate that I miss you this much. I have never felt heartbreak like this. I actually feel the physical pain. I genuinely am unsure if I can move on from this. 

I miss your smell. It still gives me butterflies, visions of our first kiss. I still have your tshirt as a pillowcase. 

I miss your laugh. It was the most genuine, comforting sound. You being happy is the greatest sound. 

I miss your hair. Playing with it while you drove. When I would stop, you would grab my hand and put it back on your head. Sometimes I would stop on purpose just for that. 

I miss your friendship. The way you throughly and genuinely understood me as a person. The way you would listen and remember things. Your emotional intelligence is admirable. 

I miss your cooking. Watching the passion and skill you had.. I could taste love in everything you made. You would always give me your first bite, no matter where we were. I dream about standing in your kitchen again, and you spoon feeding me the desserts you made for me. 

I miss the pure, incredibly effortless way we just understood each other. You got me. My urge to bite you out of pure, genuine love. Sometimes you would put your arm up to my mouth if I was sad. 

I miss the moments driving home, where you would purposely pass my house if a song was playing that I loved. You would circle the block until the song was over. 

I miss how silly you were. Painting my nails for me at 2am. The way you would make me play board games while we had coffee in the mornings. 

I miss going to concerts with you. Looking over at you, seeing how happy you were, how gorgeous you are- singing, dancing. I remember one time I started crying because of how happy I was. I grabbed you and layed my head on your chest while we sang. Wishing that moment would never end. Concerts with you hold some of my favorite moments. 

I miss how easy you made it to be in love. 

Do you remember that time we were on the phone? You were playing video games and I made a comment that I wish I could be there watch you play. You know how much I loved that. What did you do? You said you had to go. But to my surprise, within the 30 minutes it took you to call me back, you created a twitch account and sent me an invite to your stream. So I could watch you play. That was the moment I knew without a shadow of a doubt that you are the one. 

Yet given all of this love. It still ended. 

Not because our love ended for eachother. But because of your family. Your culture. This truly will never make sense to me. 

I don‚Äôt know how I can hold soo much love yet such an enormous amount of anger and hatred. I did everything for your family to accept me. I studied their religion, your culture, learned how to cook the meals your mom makes back home. I even became fluent in your native language to communicate with them. To better understand you. Your past. Your friends. Your humor. 

The love I had for you saw no boundaries. 

But it wasn‚Äôt enough. In the cruelest way, your family gave you an ultimatum. It has taken me months to come to terms that I cannot fully blame them. I understand and accept the fact that I will never understand being an immigrant. Nor the family pressure that provides. It‚Äôs so engrained in your culture. You experienced the western way of life. Your parents have not. They have never left their village. 

Unfairly, you had to pick. Me or them. 

Whichever side you chose, you lost someone.

If you picked me, you would have lost your family. They would have disowned you. Cut you off. Excluded you forever. This meant never seeing your sister again. Your nephew. Your cousins. As selfish as I wanted to be, I would have never let you choose me anyways. You would have grown to resent me. I would feel guilt and pressure to make it up to you. Being the only one left in your life that was family. 

But sitting here having been the one not chosen, I am lost. I am devastated. It hurts. There doesn‚Äôt have to be an ultimatum. Why can‚Äôt two people in love be together?! 

But what hurts the most is knowing how alone he is now. I feel so bad for the position he was put in. He deserves a family that loves him and supports him. I would have done everything for him, but that wasn‚Äôt good enough for his mom. 

Just because I am not Indian. 

I remember the day it happened. We had such a fun weekend together. Not a care in the world, we were snuggled on the couch watching a movie. I was biting your arm when you got up and went to the bathroom, but I could hear you arguing on the phone. 

When you got back you were different. You seemed scared. But you said nothing was wrong. I now realize you were processing what just happened. 

What happened next I could have never imagined. It replays in my head. You say, ‚Äúwe can‚Äôt be together anymore‚Äù with huge tears running down your face, and everything for me went blurry. I was so caught off guard. Your dad had called you. It was news to me, but apparently your mom was refusing to talk to you for months. Because of me. Your dad finally reaches out to tell you to break up with me, or your mother would kill herself. 

I truly didn‚Äôt believe it. But Indian culture is cruel and manipulative. It quickly became apparent you were not joking. 

The rest of that afternoon was a blur. I had never seen him cry before, it broke my heart but I felt like I was watching it like a movie. I sat on the couch. You were running around my house fixing things you knew needed done. Probably knowing you‚Äôd never see me again, and i couldnt do these things on my own. I didn‚Äôt stop you. I was in shock. I watched you put together my bookshelf with tears rolling down your face. You fixed my controller, wiping the snot and tears on your sleeve. You ordered my favorite food, knowing I would refuse to eat or cook. You know how I get when I‚Äôm upset. You put it in the fridge for when I get hungry. 

Before you left we held each other for what felt like forever. I wasn‚Äôt crying. I wasn‚Äôt feeling. I was in disbelief. I hadn‚Äôt processed it yet. I was so confused and had so many questions. 

The last thing you said before you left was, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll find you in my next life time.‚Äù

I hope I do. 

I did find out that your parents made you move back home. And you have an arranged marriage. This equally breaks my heart. Not solely due to my selfishness and jealousy. But because you deserve happiness. You deserve someone who understands you. Someone who in so in love with you that they don‚Äôt know who they are in your absence. 

I truly do wish you the best of luck. You will forever be my person in every life time. 

This world is so cruel.

1mnw7f1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mnw7f1,MMS Metalworks Low Profile Stem: a TMtugboat review,"I‚Äôve had this stem all week and I‚Äôve just done a deep clean. Here‚Äôs my take on a few aspects:

Appearance: I love the look of it! It‚Äôs really well machined and the ‚Äúlip‚Äù of the device fits comfortably with my draw style. It is really well and smoothly machined. It also keeps my device discreet. It looks almost like a nicotine vape. I use this out on the street sometimes and this was why I went with this design.

Durability: I‚Äôve dropped it a few times. No damage. This thing is solid. 

Loading/unloading: The flat screen sits in the stem snugly and the cooling system remains solidly in place, allowing for me to use the straw method to load and a debowler to unload with minimal effort or fiddling (one of my issues with glass stems basket screens). The only time things get difficult is when it becomes clogged with reclaim after some longer sessions.

Cleaning: This was the category that had me worried. I have never had a stem with this cooling system before. Essentially the stem is filled with small steel plates that form little cooling domes. The fact that you can thread them on the included wire tool means my worries were unfounded. I‚Äôve included pictures of the process. I got everything cleaned in my ultrasonic and back together in five minutes.

Cooling: Now for the performance categories. This thing cools surprisingly well. I use the higher end of the temperature range and it stays cool on the lips for about 6 heat cycles, hitting each stem 2-3 times. I usually hit it while it‚Äôs warm to the touch for 5 or six more, and then set it aside to cool down a bit. It‚Äôs usually back to comfortable temp within about 10 minutes, so I use my Grav up line taster for a bit in that time.

Vapor: This stem produces about 15-20% thicker and more voluminous vapor than the up line, which I‚Äôll use for comparison purposes. This is likely due to how short the vapor path is. I can actually feel the air pulling in to the intake holes while I hit this which actually allows me to adjust my hit as I go. The clouds are opaque and I have whitewalled my car with it using this native.

Flavor: When this thing is clean, the coolness and thickness of the vapor has allowed me to taste new notes in a few strains: an almost ice cream like flavor off a kush hit me today for example. The flavor compared to glass does drop off with use for one reason: I tend to clean my glass more during my sessions because I can see the build up. 

Extraction: I have taken a stem from green to coffee color in one heat cycle, much darker than I can get with other stems including the up line. I attribute this to increased airflow. However there is usually a ring of green material around the edge so I often hit it lighter, stir, then hit it for all it‚Äôs worth.

Let me know if there‚Äôs anything else I can cover about this handy piece of design and craftsmanship!

There are a lot of other details that I could talk about but to sum the parts that are really preventing me from truly moving on are the lies. 
Now for the record I did not know this person long. I did not trust my ability of judgement because I met them at the point I was ready to build my esteem and confidence up several months after a break up. The one thing I did make clear was my morals and views about single moms with children and new men. I was not going to bring him around my son at all I never had the intention to. 
I timidly allowed this person out of fear for their safety because I was told a lie that they‚Äôre traveling home from work and they don‚Äôt want to wreck etc‚Ä¶ as dominantly aggressive I was about how lame and stupidly pathetic that sounded as an excuse to see me I was very resistant to this because I had only met them once offline for a coffee, we had virtually only been talking for six days before we met and he gave me this bullshit at about two weeks of realizing another existence. I felt like I was being played about his fear of safety, but I couldn‚Äôt get comfortable with thinking what if they do wreck and die. So I caved and I caved because the projected time of arrival was going to be several hours after I have my son asleep. And I decided the plan that I preferred was because I had an early morning, they could just sleep in and once they are are awake after their long drive to just please lock the door don‚Äôt let my dog escape. Money can replace anything stolen. I was going to sleep in my sons room and they can have my bedroom. 
However, he arrived not five to six hours later like he mentioned but instead 45 minutes later and my son and I were just in front corridor of our home when this person walks in, doesn‚Äôt say anything, walks past us, and goes upstairs and nearly slams the door to my bedroom. My son and I look at each other but of course I wanted my son trust me and giggled with my child about how rude and said I would be right back. Everything was fine they were tired so I get my son ready I tell him that‚Äôs mommy‚Äôs friend he said he was super tired and he is very appreciative of us letting him stay over. And then ask my son if it was okay if I can sleep on the couch in his room and he says okay and everything was fine and the morning was fine as well. 
This mf never leaves my house. 
I did not want to teach the wrong ways to handle situations during the whole experience of this individual being my boyfriend for the last year and 9 months. 
I could throw a lot of terms around but I‚Äôm not a psychologist I‚Äôm not a professional. In fact I went from the bread winner to an alcoholic that carried the responsibility of a functional 6k monthly expenses for a comfortable life for my toddler son and husky dog, to a jobless, childless, drunk, that is in therapy with currently praying that I get blessed with a donation at this point so I am not evicted out of my home right before the court systems allow me to begin the reunification process of my son. 

However I cannot get over the guilt of this. The thoughts in my head. With the amount of lies and terror that reigned and controlled me with me fighting back everything I had toe to toe with him. At times choosing silence and then privately speaking with my son about the environment and how it is not cool and not nice and what is nice and what is okay to do with people whom are not so nice, and then other times I am calling my mother at the last minute, asking for help, and picking up ice cream for my child taking him to Nana‚Äôs for an hour that turns into 3-6 hours just so I can‚Äôt give this mf a pos of my mind finally for things going on in my home. Sometimes it would be violent but not usually. Mostly hollering belittling, very psychologically abusive spiritually battering etc. there were limits to things I couldn‚Äôt lower myself to meet him on his level and he would refuse to get up and come to mine. 
The police had been involved multiples times. I had kicked him out the neighbor had thrown him out of my house. But eventually it wouldn‚Äôt matter because either he would stay in my driveway for days at a time literally and then one time when taking the keys from him, locking myself in his car to find the copies of the keys he made himself and getting him out of the house and then tossing the few things he would bring inside of the home out the window‚Ä¶but he just climbed the balcony and kicked in my door. So at that point there is no getting rid of this person until they are ready to be done with me. And at this point decided to change scripts on my end to making the best of something I didn‚Äôt want or approve. 

And it was at this time that I am struggling to regain employment because of the abuse and keep the steady job for the childcare etc. and I hated it but I needed him to babysit for four hours in the morning my son could stay asleep during this time for a cleaning job. And it wasn‚Äôt far from my house either. I‚Äôm doing what I have to do. And for some reason I‚Äôm checking the security camera the nanny camera as the notifications of like human detection was one and stuff out of no where they are all shut off. And his phone is turned off. Of course like anyone else in that position I figured I would just ask for forgiveness later. 

How do I cope with this situation the questions, the not knowing, not triggering my son, and being able to be the person he needs to be, accepting my weaknesses to turn them into strengths and not be desensitized so much that I no longer feel guilt or burden about something that couldn‚Äôt control but also being the safe person I need to be and be mentally healthy and okay. Because what if it is every parents nightmare??? He‚Äôs out of the home and has been. I didn‚Äôt lose my son to drinking or violence but to the mental health issue that trigged cpstd to be in full range and even tho I can fake it for my son for the moment I can‚Äôt trick a professional and my cpstd being triggered mental health issues from the abuse. 

But when my son comes back, the negative self talk, the social anxiety of guilt the, obsessive fear of never dating anyone again. How do I cope with empty answers from a stranger that has only ever lied to me being a Christian woman wasn‚Äôt enough because I allowed my protective instincts to turn me into a monster and then Christian guilt for everything else. When leaving the part of denial happens and I face the truth of what I have put my house through‚Ä¶ with no one to turn to the police couldn‚Äôt do much help because he was so good at manipulating everything‚Ä¶ and then when facing the truth it‚Äôs all bad, how do I not kill him‚Ä¶ and then live with the fact that I didn‚Äôt kill him ‚Ä¶.

***OWNER SURRENDER***

Evaluation Notes:08/05/2025
Owner surrendered due to owner issue.
Dog is lunging, snarling and barking at the barrier upon first approach. He is avoidant by retreating to the other side of the kennel with a tucked tail as I open the door. He is avoidant of the leash by moving his head away and snapping and biting the leash when it's near his head. He is able to be leashed utilizing a safety tool and walks outside where he pulls heavily on the leash. He walks circles around me with a tense body, tucked tail, avoiding eye contact and is not able to adjust for the entirety of the interaction. He does not take treats at this time and is not interested in interacting with any handlers. He is walked back to his
kennel as he continues to pull heavily on leash. Behavior possibly due to environment and/or under socialization. Continue to monitor.

Dog is tense with a tucked tail and retreats to the other side of the kennel with a lowered head upon first approach. He is avoidant of the leash by moving his head around. He is able to be leashed utilizing a safety tool after two attempts and he walks out on his own where he pulls heavily. He flinches when handlers touch any point on his body. After some time, he allows the safety tool to be replaced with a slip lead and walks into the play yard slowly with a tucked tail and tense body. He is avoidant of the female dog in the yard by walking to the other side with a tense body and tucked tail. His leash is dropped and he stays in place with the same body language and allows the dog to come up and sniff his hind end and chest area. When the dog attempts to sniff/lick his face, he communicates for space appropriately by snarling. He stands in the same spot for the entirety
of the interaction and does not adjust. He is easy to return to his kennel. Behavior possibly due to environment and/or
under socialization.

I maybe need help here or maybe I‚Äôve stumbled on the best gift idea since birthdays learned about chocolates. Has ANYONE else seen or gotten an ""AI gift card?"" Wait, stick with me‚Äîbecause, yes, AI. Gift. Card.

First impression: kind of like giving someone magic beans, except if the beans wrote you a poem, drew your portrait *and* helped with your taxes. So I sat there staring at this little digital portal and‚Äîwait for it‚Äîit‚Äôs not just money you‚Äôre giving away. You‚Äôre gifting access to the wizardry enclave of bots, creative engines, personalized suggestions.

Like, imagine:

- Want your friend to have an AI design them a custom bedtime story every night? (Me: Yes please.)
- Or maybe they want to use AI to organize their November closet into something less terrifying? (Also me.)
- Or‚Äîpicture this‚Äîthey get a key to chat with smart storytelling bots and hook themselves up with exclusive novels and content at https://goodnovel.org/ (BTW, why didn't we have this in high school? I'd have scored higher in lit, not gonna lie.)

But here's my confusion and excitement colliding:

‚Ä¢ Is this actually *personal* or has gifting now become FULLY digital?
‚Ä¢ What if you don‚Äôt *use up* your AI credits and it's just floating in tech purgatory?
‚Ä¢ Is it weird that I‚Äôd HAPPILY receive this over another dusty candle?

I tested it for myself‚Äîpicked a card that let a friend unlock a treasure trove of creative AI tools and reading perks at https://goodnovel.org/ (yes, again because it‚Äôs *that* cool), and they sent me chapters of stories they generated within like, an hour. Dystopian, romantic, holiday-themed‚ÄîAI churned ‚Äòem out like literary party favors.

Okay, now I‚Äôm thinking‚Äîwhat if the real luxury gift isn‚Äôt diamonds or handcrafted silk scarves, but an *experience* that adapts to me in real time? Just saying, lightning fast algorithms and unlimited prompts feel a lot sparklier than socks.

But here‚Äôs my hang-up:

- Does this make lineage/family heirloom gifts look outdated, or is AI tech just a different flavor?
- Are we all about to get *way* lazier now that an artificial brain can do everything?
- (Low key want to see Hallmark try this. ‚ÄúFor the bot in your life.‚Äù LOL.)

So yeah‚Äîthat‚Äôs the short circuit in my brain. Am I overthinking? Do I need less coffee and more time on https://goodnovel.org/ just reading AI-generated stories‚Äîand maybe next time, gifting credit to myself?

Curious what YOU all think‚Äîtoo out there, or ridiculously perfect for our digital lives? What‚Äôs next, AI perfume samplers?? Hit me with your weirdest (or smartest) AI gift ideas.",1,1754963860.0,LuxuryGiftsf,0,1.0,False

1mnw0xi,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedditHorrorStories/comments/1mnw0xi/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:

‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô

‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù

‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù

Some even claimed to see images of Bad Mouse himself in the background of scenes of terror and bloodshed, though those were usually not very clear. Occasionally, a clip of Bad Mouse would be shown and then just disappear. All of this was absolutely chilling, especially considering it was shown to young children, but it was far from over. During a hijacking of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse on the morning of July 25, a message from Bad Mouse claimed that August 12 would be ‚Äúdeath day‚Äù. Everyone‚Äôs blood ran cold. What did Bad Mouse mean? No one could know, but the message was already out there, so everyone braced for the worst.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all in a panic. They cut all broadcasts, including off-air and live shows, and immediately called up their network technicians. To everyone‚Äôs horror, the technicians were unable to locate the origin of the hijackings. They could find no source, no one was even able to log in to the programming or mess with the technical equipment, and no technician was able to determine the cause. There was no foreign software or anything of the sort.

Security cameras showed no suspicious activity. Arguments ensued, fingers were pointed, hardworking employees were fired without warning, and the situation looked grimmer and grimmer. This was an all-out war, and no one knew why it was happening or how to stop it.

By August, the situation had spiraled out of control. It was no longer just a technical issue, but an outright attack on the three major children‚Äôs networks. The situation spiraled into full chaos, with Bad Mouse still unstoppable and the networks still in chaos. By now, all the technicians who were responsible for maintaining these networks and getting them up and running had been fired, leaving all the channel‚Äôs executives at a loss of what to do. All they could do was wait and see.

On August 12, the atmospheres at the three studios were tense. They made the conscious decision to stay open, not wishing to appear weak or stupid, and wanting to show Bad Mouse that they were not afraid of it. Their broadcasts of beloved children‚Äôs shows began as normal. For a while, everything actually seemed relatively normal. No hijackings happened yet, but just as everyone at the studios were beginning to think that they might be okay, something happened, a massacre of unimaginable brutality, a tragedy of such a scale that the world would never be the same again.

In a little over half an hour, six napalm bombs went off, two at each studio. In the blink of an eye, 115 people were dead and hundreds more were injured. They came out of nowhere, with no warning, and no way to tell who, what, or where they came from. One Nickelodeon employee, Mike Ewart, was speaking with a colleague near the front doors. One moment, she was laughing and smiling, sipping her Starbucks coffee, and the next, she was completely and utterly obliterated. Ewart said that ""it was like slow motion...I saw her body just vaporize. I felt her warmth just vanish. I felt her coffee splash on me. I was just numb.‚Äù

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was. That was all they had to go on for physical evidence besides the bombs themselves, which were found to be homemade devices filled with both black powder and a highly flammable petrochemical substance, both of which were placed in three-gallon plastic gas containers. Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty. No one saw any suspicious activity at any time in any of the studios, and no one knew who could have or would have done such a horrific thing. FBI analysts even took a look at the original tapes, the ones that were rejected by the three studios, to see if there was something they missed. Still...nothing.

All three targets were devastated, but the Nickelodeon building received the greatest damage, with three fifths of the building destroyed. Much of the buildings were rendered uninhabitable by the immense heat and force of the explosions, and while they have since been repaired and remodeled, the damaged portions have been sealed off and turned into memorials.

The perpetrator behind Bad Mouse is a mystery. No suspects or leads were ever found. Clearly, they were a lunatic with an insane dream that they wanted to see realized, who wanted to make a big impact on the world. They went off the deep end when their show was rejected. Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney all closed for months after the incident and are still getting back on their feet today.

As time went on, people began to wonder why the networks would never make a statement on the incident. Many thought that maybe it would scare everyone away from watching their programming, but there's definitely more to it than that. Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network executives were all interviewed by the press, but they were extremely vague, simply saying that they were still working on ‚Äúa little something‚Äù to pay their respects to the victims and they never commented on Bad Mouse itself.

But the scars still exist. Bad Mouse is still burned into the minds of those who lived through it, and many are too afraid to talk about it or discuss the memories they have, but a few brave souls have come forward to share their experiences through interviews and documentaries. Even the intern was interviewed, though he wished to remain anonymous.

No one knows who Bad Mouse really is, and no one ever will. People have wanted to know more about the perpetrator of such a heinous crime. It was beyond obvious what their motivations were, but the question of whoever was encrypted as Bad Mouse, much like Jack the Ripper and the Zodiac Killer, will simply never be known.

1mnw04a,https://www.reddit.com/r/terrifying/comments/1mnw04a/bad_mouse/,Bad Mouse,"It all started on a sunny summer day in 2009 when three separate packages arrived on the doorsteps of the Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney studios. They were anonymous packages with no postmarks or return addresses. No one saw them being delivered, and each had only a simple note attached which read ‚ÄúI have created something I love. From me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù. Strange, but the recipients decided to humor the packages anyway, thinking it was fanmail or something of the sort. When they were opened, they revealed several video tapes.

They all had titles hastily scribbled on, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 1‚Äù, ‚ÄúBad Mouse: Episode 2‚Äù, and so on. There were 13 in total, the last of which had an additional notation reading ‚ÄúThis is the last‚Äù. As to the contents of the tapes, they contained what everyone assumed to be ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù, who was a mouse sock puppet, complete with two large ears, eyes, and buck teeth all clearly made with paper, but it had arms that were clearly stitched on in post and a cartoony tail that did not match the rest of the sock puppet.

All of the tapes were in black and white, and had very simple premises. In a high-pitched and nasally voice, Bad Mouse talked about numbers, the alphabet, animals, colors, and other really straightforward topics. They were only about four or five minutes long each, with no background music, title cards, or anything. Just Bad Mouse talking.

Nothing was too unusual or frightening about the ‚Äúshow‚Äù, so to speak. Clearly, it was done on a very low budget, but what exactly was the point of it? It surely would not entertain anyone over the age of three. Some dismissed it as some kind of stupid prank, while others joked that whoever delivered these tapes to the studios was banking on Bad Mouse being made into an actual show. Unfortunately, that was not how it worked, and after all the episodes were viewed and everyone got a good laugh at someone‚Äôs pitiful attempt at stardom, the episodes were all dismissed and promptly canned, though there were some who found Bad Mouse to be unsettling and creepy, but they would never bring that up in front of their colleagues.

That was supposed to be the end of it, but just one week later, more packages arrived, with the note now reading ‚ÄúFrom me to you, Bad Mouse‚Äù, the ‚ÄúI have something I love‚Äù being notably omitted. Inside the packages were 13 tapes, just like last time, and when everyone gathered to watch them, they were actually surprised. While each episode was about the same length as before, the show actually had color, plots, music, title cards, more sock puppet characters, and environments, though it was still clearly made on the smallest ounce of a budget.

The visuals and effects were shoddy at best, whoever was voicing Bad Mouse clearly voiced the other sock puppet characters, there was a strange hum of static in the background, and occasionally a loud beeping noise came from out of nowhere and bloodied the ears of all who heard it. Needless to say, it was not nearly enough to convince the executives to even fathom the idea of greenlighting it, and Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network all tossed the tapes into the garbage.

‚ÄúBad Mouse is getting desperate!‚Äù a Nickelodeon executive quipped after sipping his coffee.

Was that the end of it? Everyone thought so until another week had passed and three more packages just bearing the words ‚ÄúBad Mouse‚Äù arrived at each studio, and all three went straight to the trash can. However, a curious Cartoon Network intern secretly fished their package out of the trash. He had heard of Bad Mouse‚Äôs depravity from his colleagues, and as an avid collector of lost and unknown media on the side, this would be absolutely perfect for him. He took the tapes home and immediately popped them into his old VCR.

Judging by the small increase in quality in the second round of packages, the intern assumed that whoever was behind Bad Mouse had finally learned their lesson, but each tape showed a disturbing clip of the same thing: no color, no plots, no music, no title cards, no other characters, and no environments‚Ä¶just Bad Mouse sitting motionless and staring straight at the camera. Every thirty seconds or so, the sock puppet would say the words ‚ÄúGetting desperate‚Äù, but only in syllables:

‚ÄùGet‚Ä¶ting‚Ä¶des‚Ä¶per‚Ä¶ate‚Äù.

The intern did not scare too easily, and he did not think much of it other than it being pretty odd. Shrugging, he popped the tapes out of the old VCR, placed them with his other tapes and DVDs he had acquired throughout the years, and went to bed.

No more packages showed up after that. No more tapes. No more Bad Mouse. The whole ordeal seemed to be over‚Ä¶and it was. Until about a year later, when Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network‚Äôs channels were all hijacked.

By this point, everyone had basically forgotten about Bad Mouse. It was now just a fleeting memory of some desperate and depraved soul thinking they would make it big, something to bring up if you wanted to point and laugh. But the first signs of trouble were on Nickelodeon, specifically Nick Jr.

The characters Moose and Zee had in-between blocks where they provided information and education between shows. On the morning of July 12, 2010, a segment where Moose was supposed to teach the audience about names was hijacked by none other than Bad Mouse. In the middle of speaking, Moose went frozen and silent, the music cut out, and the screen glitched until Bad Mouse was there for the entire world to see.

Though no one watching at home could recognize what they were seeing, the network executives certainly did. Bad Mouse spoke to a bunny character (which was clearly just a stuffed animal and was aptly named ""Bunny"") about the importance of sharing. The mouse sock puppet ripped a toy truck out of Bunny's hands and ran away laughing, and Bunny just stood there, staring at the camera for about a minute. After that, it switched to a scene of Bad Mouse riding a little bike through a very poorly made cardboard field. A kindergarten play could create better sets than Bad Mouse ever could. He sang this song that sounded like complete nonsense in a voice that would make ears bleed.

""That petty asshole..."" said one network executive. It seemed that if they did not air Bad Mouse, then Bad Mouse was just going to do it themself.

The network executives were too embarrassed to simply power down the channel over what was definitely a stupid prank. They thought just slapping the technical difficulties screen on it would do the trick every time, but that did not stop Bad Mouse. For the next two weeks, all the shows on air were cut off and the broadcasts became a mess due to Bad Mouse jumbling everything up.

Bad Mouse would always return, just playing the same 13 crappy episodes on repeat. Calls were made by angry parents and their confused children, and each channel promised to resolve the issues, but they never could. While all three channels were determined to solve the issues, in the grand scheme of things, no one took them \*that\* seriously. They came off as more annoying than anything.

Nickelodeon, Disney, and Cartoon Network made it absolutely clear that this was \*not\* their doing and that their broadcasts had been hijacked, and they did not know who it was or where it was coming from. With those statements out to linger in the air, the internet began to fill with rumors and speculation. Everyone was curious about the problems their children‚Äôs channels were having. There were still people assuming it was just a very clever prank and was the work of people who had nothing better to do but get a rise out of these channels and their viewers.

Others had‚Ä¶darker theories, many of them poked and made fun of for being just as stupid as Bad Mouse itself, ranging from Bad Mouse being the work of a disgruntled employee, an artificial intelligence, a paranormal phenomenon, aliens, or some kind of supernatural or superhuman entity. In today‚Äôs world, we are all pretty cynical and seem to disregard more dramatic notions because it does not align with our short-ordered view of reality.

Despite the many rumors, as July came to a close, things seemed to be getting better. By then, the executives at Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Disney had found a way to block out all the messaging and instead broadcast either a default bumper or a continuous feed of static for the channels until they could figure out the issue. As a result, the hijackings had slowed down significantly. They defeated Bad Mouse.

By September 1st, there was no more hijackings at all, so it seemed that Bad Mouse had simply moved on to other things. Everyone was relieved, but there was still the occasional hushed murmur that whoever was behind these hijackings would be back, because clearly, Bad Mouse seemed like a persistent weirdo. Some even went so far as to say that Bad Mouse would bring violence with it, which was laughed off as completely and utterly ridiculous.

How very wrong those people were.

For a long time, there was nothing, like before. All of it was the calm before the storm, and boy, did it storm. 2011 was coming and going with nothing unusual happening. SpongeBob cooked Krabby Patties, Mickey Mouse took us on adventures around his clubhouse, and The Amazing World of Gumball was premiering its first season to massive success. Even the once active internet forums were completely empty, with Bad Mouse just being touted as a fun, if bizarre, little piece of lost media that was stuck in the past. All was well until the summer arrived‚Ä¶

There were so many more hijackings. All three networks were affected. Instead of just being Bad Mouse episodes, they were much more...disturbing. Each one lasted anywhere from 15 minutes to a full hour, depending on the severity, and each one was worse than the last. Beginning the same way, either flickering, frames repeating themselves, sound not syncing up, waving and jittering, or random pauses, something would always happen. Sometimes the screens would be replaced with deeply disturbing edits of whatever character was on screen, often making them appear angry at the audience.

Sometimes, the screen would fade into bloodied static for a few moments, then go right back to normal programming. Sometimes random images and videos would flash on the screen, such as a pictures of the White House on fire, footage of mice, someone walking outside at night, and random YouTube videos, but there was also disturbing imagery of people being tortured, mutilated, beheaded, people being shot at point-blank range, and even all manners of illegal pornography. Sometimes, an extremely loud beeping sound would bloody the ears of all who heard it (not unlike what was head in the first Bad Mouse video tapes), blocking out everything that was being said. Sometimes vague or threatening messages were displayed such as:

‚Äúi‚Äôm here‚Äù‚Äô

‚Äúis it getting desperate?‚Äù

‚Äúi hate you all‚Äù

‚Äúi have to get attention‚Äù

‚Äúi‚Äôm desperate!‚Äù

‚Äúyou love me, but I don‚Äôt love you‚Äù

The police found a lone Bad Mouse sock puppet lying amongst the rubble at the Disney Studio, charred and damn near impossible to identify what it even was.

Each one was placed in dense areas within each target to maximize the death toll.

A task force of hundreds of police officers from all over the country and federal agencies converged on all three studios. Thousands of leads were investigated, and they all came up empty.

1mnvzkq,https://www.reddit.com/r/BarracudaNetworks/comments/1mnvzkq/vacation_season_is_open_season_for_cybercriminals/,Vacation season is open season for cybercriminals: Here‚Äôs why,"For school children, summer means lazy days of swimming pools, splash pads, melting ice cream cones, and camp.¬†For cybersecurity professionals, it means being on guard 24/7, because cybercriminals don‚Äôt take a summer break.

# The summertime impact

Cyberattacks now occur every 39 seconds globally, while¬†[worldwide cybercrime costs are estimated to hit $10.5 trillion annually by 2025](https://cybersecurityventures.com/hackerpocalypse-cybercrime-report-2016/). Additionally, summer brings its own set of complications that amplify these already staggering statistics. While you are applying the next layer of sunscreen by the hotel pool, hackers are hard at work.¬†

Reduced staffing during summer vacation season creates critical vulnerabilities, with temporary staff often lacking adequate security awareness training and being more susceptible to phishing attacks. Meanwhile, the increase in remote work from vacation rentals and coffee shops exposes organizations to unsecured WiFi risks, creating new attack vectors that cybercriminals are eager to exploit.¬†

‚ÄúWhile summer usually means vacation for most people, we‚Äôve seen quite the opposite on the cybersecurity front‚Äîphishing scams are spiking, artificial intelligence (AI)-generated fraud is getting smarter, and remote access vulnerabilities are still a major weak spot,‚Äù says John Hansman, CEO of cybersecurity company Truit.¬†

Perhaps most troubling is the timing factor.

Automated out-of-office replies provide attackers with valuable intelligence about employee absences, allowing them to time their attacks for maximum impact when security teams are operating with skeleton crews.¬†

The convergence of relaxed vigilance, reduced staffing, and increased online activity creates a Petri dish of summer cybercrime.¬†

# What MSPs need to do

For managed service providers (MSPs) serving clients across multiple industries, understanding these seasonal threat patterns isn‚Äôt just helpful‚Äîit‚Äôs the key to maintaining robust security postures when businesses are most vulnerable.¬†

Mike Kutlu, GTM Operations at c/side, mentions that while many organizations are focused on endpoint and network-layer risks, there‚Äôs a growing storm at the browser layer that‚Äôs catching even seasoned MSPs/managed security services providers (MSSPs)/chief information security officer (CISAs) off guard.¬†

‚ÄúThis summer, browser-side attacks, especially those exploiting third-party JavaScript dependencies, are emerging as one of the most active and least visible threat vectors,‚Äù Kutlu adds, mentioning that these attacks don‚Äôt target your infrastructure directly, but instead weaponize code that loads in the end user‚Äôs browser, often from trusted tools like analytics, chat widgets, or payment processors.¬†

‚ÄúThe kicker is that most organizations have no idea what‚Äôs running in that browser environment or how it‚Äôs changing,‚Äù as Kutlu notes that summer is prime time for campaigns like these.¬†

To stay ahead, Kutlu advises that MSPs and MSSPs should prioritize a few key actions, including:¬†

* Regularly auditing client websites to inventory all first and third-party scripts and understand what those scripts actually do.¬†
* Adding real-time monitoring in place to catch unauthorized changes to scripts and HTTP headers (sampling-based approaches are no longer sufficient).¬†
* Ensuring clients comply with PCI DSS 4.0.1, which now mandates tamper-detection mechanisms for any site handling cardholder data.¬†
* Scrutinizing the provenance of every script, as even a widely used library can become malicious after a silent update or DNS takeover.¬†

# The seasonal spike in cyberthreats

Meanwhile, Brian Blakey, vice-president of cybersecurity strategies at ConnectSecure, agrees that summer is an important time for MSPs to stay vigilant.¬†‚ÄúFor cybersecurity professionals, summer is anything but quiet,‚Äù he shares, noting that major U.S. holidays like Memorial Day, July 4th, and Labor Day consistently bring sharp spikes in cyberattacks. Ransomware incidents can rise by as much as 30 percent during these low-staff periods.

‚ÄúThreat actors know that IT and security teams are stretched thin, with slower response times and relaxed oversight creating the perfect storm for exploitation,‚Äù Blakey asserts, adding that what‚Äôs especially ‚Äúhot‚Äù this summer isn‚Äôt just AI-powered malware or new zero-days ‚Äì it‚Äôs human downtime.¬†

‚ÄúLax coverage, temporary admin access, and out-of-office replies all become attack vectors. We‚Äôre seeing a rise in weaponized OOO replies, spoofed multi-factor authentication (MFA) fatigue prompts, and ransomware campaigns precisely timed for maximum impact before a long weekend,‚Äù as he adds that summer is the peak season for cybersecurity ‚Äì not a lull.¬†‚ÄúMSPs and CISAs must stay proactive by tightening access controls, strengthening coverage during holidays, and treating long weekends as high-risk periods. Because while your team may be out of office, adversaries are very much clocked in.‚Äù

Summer may signal downtime for many businesses, but for cybercriminals, it‚Äôs go time. With rising attack volume, smarter tactics, and human vulnerabilities at their peak, MSPs and MSSPs must treat the season as a critical threat window, not a break. Staying vigilant, tightening controls, and monitoring overlooked areas like browser activity aren‚Äôt just best practices. They‚Äôre essential moves to keep clients safe while everyone else is unplugging.

Drove home checked in with family and friends. Did a little work. At the end of the day, I get a message.

It's from the biological mother of the young lady I was hoping to raise with my wife. 

We have a short business conversation. I say some nice things to her. She says some nice things to me. It's the first connection with anyone related to my soon to be ex-wife in a year. She thanks me for all I did for her daughter, which means the world to me.

And then she starts, asking me to do or not to do certain things during my divorce. She does it from the stance of a mother‚Ä¶ Which only makes sense. She asks me not to disturb the home, that my wife and her child are living in. The home I put the majority of my net worth down on. 

Then she tells me how disappointed she is that I won't be a lifelong father figure to her daughter. 

I will never be able to make this woman understand what it was like behind closed doors. No one will. I would give a lot to have recorded what it was like In my own bedroom for the last seven years. The fear. The insanity. The rage. The complete and total Transformation into alcohol fueled insanity. It would be worth being embarrassed for people to see me there, acting, helpless and pathetic as she excoriated me with her bulging eyes, her red face, her swollen neck, the spittle forming on her lips, as she rocked back-and-forth and fought for breath between screams.

I will never get anyone to understand this. And as this mother asks me to sacrifice more for the sake of a child I had hoped to raise‚Ä¶ My stomach begins to turn. My pulse quickens. I feel a disturbed and sick weakness run through me that I haven't felt for months.

I type and send ""understood"", which I immediately regret. She starts acting as though I have agreed. Sending hearts and thank yous‚Ä¶ I don't know what to say. I feel chaos and fear begin to run through me, and I resist the urge to say anything more. I put down the phone. I call a friend, and he pulls me back to reality. It's good to have a friend.

It's OK to block people out. They will never understand. They are part of my wife's narrative. The years of love and service that I gave were not enough for my wife. The respect that I had earned was lost the moment my wife decided to start turning her people.

It's OK to block out her people.

I used to love being liked. Part of me still does. But it can't be more important than what's right. It can't be more important than peace and safety.

There are 8 billion other people.

I have no debt. I have no criminal record. I have been a kind and respectful person most of my life. I have been lucky in so many ways.

It's OK to block out her people. I don't need to make them understand. I need to leave them be. I need space.

It's OK to block people out.

Even the people you cooked for at Christmas. Even the people who loved you and hugged you. Even the people who clapped you on the back. It's OK to block them out. They are my wife's people. They are my wife's followers. They are inside my wife's narrative.

It's OK to block people out.

1mnvxos,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1mnvxos/part_1_the_pancake_house_apocalypse_guide/,Part 1 The Pancake House Apocalypse Guide,"Chapter 1 - Mick

	Driving down the mostly deserted street, I finished my cheap motel coffee, tasting the even cheaper whiskey, burning my throat and igniting a fire in my stomach.¬† I crested a rise in the road and saw two of the most iconic signs known to people throughout the southeastern portion of the United States.¬† Two signs with black letters on yellow backgrounds filled the horizon ‚ÄúS E R G E A N T D O L L A R‚Äù and ‚ÄúP A N C A K E H O U S E.‚Äù¬† I parked my Jeep Cherokee in the spot next to the dumpsters on the side of the Pancake House and flicked the cigarette in the general direction of the trash can.¬† As I opened the door an empty beer can rolled out and tumbled across the pavement.¬† I sighed, bent over and picked it up, tossing it into the dumpster before anyone could see.¬† The sun hadn‚Äôt quite made it over the horizon yet but was still too bright for my hung over eyes.¬† Blinking away a splitting headache, I noticed that the parking lot was empty, not even my manager‚Äôs car was parked by the back door.¬† I looked inside the diner and saw that the kitchen and dining room was empty.

	‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù¬† I said in confusion.

	Then I heard some rustling by the dumpster and saw the scraggily head of Cain pop out from behind one with scrambled eggs on his beard.¬† Cain was our resident crackhead that we allowed to kick it at the dumpster and occasionally fed him the extra food we had at the end of shifts in exchange for keeping away less savory crackheads.¬† He wasn‚Äôt the biggest guy around but you know what they say about the size of a dog in a fight and it surely fit Cain, he was a right bastard.

	‚ÄúHey!‚Äù¬† I called out to Cain, ‚ÄúWhere the hell is everybody?‚Äù

	Cain turned and studied the diner, ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù¬† Then he turned back to his scrounging.

	‚ÄúThanks for the help dick.‚Äù¬† I muttered before making my way inside the building and double checking that my car was locked.

	As I walked from the back room towards the front the sounds and smells of a kitchen invaded my senses.¬† The smell of oil, bacon and coffee filled my nose and twinged my unsettled stomach.¬† My feet slid ever so slightly as a mix of dish water, mop water and grease covered the chipped tile floor.¬† The hanging lights over the bar were still lit and all the flat surfaces were clean and spotless, there did seem to appear to be a mess behind the counter where someone dropped a plate of food and just left it for me to clean.

	‚ÄúFucking night shift.‚Äù¬† I muttered, grabbing a broom and mop.

	I idly wondered where my coworkers were at and hoped I hadn‚Äôt missed something important.¬† I really wish I hadn‚Äôt dropped my phone in the toilet full of puke the night prior so I couldn‚Äôt even text or call anyone.¬† After cleaning the mess, I let my body go through the familiar task of setting up for the day while my mind entered a pseudo meditative state where I thought of leaving and moving on to the next small town like I had been doing for the past few years.

	After about an hour, I finished all my opening duties and the duties of my still missing coworkers and really began to think that something was off.¬† Cain was usually one of the first people I saw everyday but he‚Äôs never been the **only** person I saw.¬† Come to think of it, I didn‚Äôt even see any cars on the small but (comparatively) highly trafficked road to the interstate right outside of the small town.¬† I went outside for a cigarette and I could definitely see tons of cars moving slowly down the interstate which made me feel a little better.¬†¬†

	‚ÄúMaybe there was a bad accident and that‚Äôs caused everyone to be late.‚Äù¬† I said to myself knowing full well at least Alice, my manager, lived in town not too far from the motel I stayed at.¬†¬†

	I made my way back inside and set to cooking myself some breakfast, seeing as no one was around to stop me or judge my voracious appetite.¬† Apparently, I wasn‚Äôt the only one that had this idea, as I had just plated myself a ‚ÄúTexas Pancake Melt‚Äù and double chunked, peppered and covered hashbrowns when Cain walked in, hesitantly looking around.¬†¬†

Sighing, I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Cain, c‚Äômon in.¬† Want pancakes?‚Äù

He nodded and took a seat at the bar while I set to cooking him pancakes and filled a fresh pot of coffee for the two of us.¬† We didn‚Äôt usually let Cain inside or near the entrance during busy hours as he would harass exiting patrons for change and lick his lips at pigeons that lined the roof of our building.¬† The last time Cain had come in, he had blatantly taken half eaten food off of people‚Äôs plates and, in one case, took a french fry from a child‚Äôs hand.¬† Before long however, we were sharing a meal together in only slightly uncomfortable silence staring at the cracked brown tile and pictures of the original ‚ÄúPancake House‚Äù and owner.

‚ÄúSoo, ya‚Äôlike cooking boy?‚Äù¬† He said in his raspy (scottish?) accent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the worst job I‚Äôve had, certainly not the hardest or easiest but I never go hungry.‚Äù¬† I winced, looking at the frail frame of Cain but he didn‚Äôt seem to take offence to the faux pas.

‚ÄúHad many jobs?‚Äù¬† He asked.

‚ÄúI suppose,¬† been around and worked around.¬† I was in college then moved to oil work, pipe laying, circus clown here and a ranch hand there.‚Äù¬†¬†

Cain nodded his head and raised his eyebrows in appreciation.

‚ÄúHave- you had many jobs?‚Äù¬† I asked, stumbling not sure how to ask or if to ask the question.

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù¬† He said simply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought for, been fucked for or stole everything I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

Coffee shot into my nose at his casualness of that statement and Cain laughed at my discomfort.

‚ÄúBut, like you said, this gig ain‚Äôt too bad for me neither.¬† I fight for my dumpster and I get the occasional full pancake and hot cup of coffee.‚Äù¬† He said with a pleased smile that showed off his whole three teeth.

‚ÄúWell, where do you think everyone is at?‚Äù¬† I asked, blatantly changing the topic

‚ÄúLike I said earlier lad, I haven‚Äôt got the foggiest of fucking clues.¬† It‚Äôs not like I've got a phone or nuffin.¬† But, I did hear quit the fucking racket when all those stars fell from the sky but that was after I shot up so that‚Äôs a wash if it was real or not.‚Äù

I searched my foggy memory of last night trying to think of any ‚Äòstars falling‚Äô but all I could remember was a pretty caramel face, brown curls and an unearthly color growing from the depths that made me feel nauseous when I thought of it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù¬† I said eventually. ‚ÄúI was plastered last night so I can‚Äôt exactly prove you wrong.‚Äù

We continued the rest of our meal in silence until Cain stood up from his stool.¬† ‚ÄúWell thank you for sharing a meal with me Mick, makes me feel like a man again but I got a couple of chores to do around the ole‚Äô abode.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh yeah, no problem Cain.¬† Guess I‚Äôll see you later.‚Äù¬† I said thinking of what kind of chores a crackhead has to do in a dumpster.

For the rest of the day, not a single soul got off the interstate.¬† No one entered the diner, the Sergeant Dollar behind the diner or the gas station across the street.¬† I noticed on one of my smoke breaks that neither store appeared to be open.¬† That made me anxious as I was running low on cigs and the Sergeant Dollar was the only place that got frequent shipments of Reds.¬† When I came back into the diner from that smoke break, there was an old box television and vcr on a cart in the middle of the kitchen.

‚ÄúNow what the fuck is this?‚Äù¬† I asked to the empty room.

I once again explored the diner and found no one inside and double checked the parking lot for a car and only saw my red Cherokee.¬† I went back inside and checked out the anomalous cart and found on top of the vcr was a vhs tape labelled, ‚ÄúThe Pancake House Apocalypse Guide.‚Äù¬† With growing confusion, I rolled the cart to the back office and plugged the ancient technology into an outlet and played the vhs tape, reminding me of when I was a kid at my grandparents‚Äô house watching old westerns.¬† The screen flickered green for a moment and went through the customary legal disclaimers and then the Pancake House company logo and my heart dropped, fearing a training video filled with monotone monologues and washed up 90s sitcom actors.¬† The screen flicked to a still photo of the exterior of a Pancake House and a tinny pompous male voice came out of the speakers.¬†

‚ÄúCongratulations loyal employee of the Pancake House corporation!¬† You have been selected to be a part of an elite cooking team to happily serve the weary survivors in the coming apocalypse!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck.‚Äù¬† I said for the third (fourth?) time today.

‚ÄúAs you know Pancake House has held a long tradition to stay open 24/7 365 days a year rain or shine in as many locations as possible.¬† In the past, we have implemented Jump Teams to aid areas under natural disasters, well that has evolved into Star Teams because you sir are a **star!**‚Äù¬†¬†

I idly thought about the likelihood of this being some elaborate prank by my coworkers because there was no way a corporation in the 2020s was going to use a definitive gender noun rather than a gender neutral one, no matter how tiresome it became.

‚ÄúIn these unprecedented times, we ask you, the best of our very best, to serve your company to the best of your abilities and we will provide you with everything you shall need.¬† The rest of this guide shall guide you through the apocalypse with ease and shall become your new holy doctrine.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes at hearing the cheery voice utter ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù I was so tired of hearing that fucking word.¬† It seemed like at every turn in my life there was another ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù event that would ‚Äúirrevocably‚Äù change the world.¬† Y2k, 9/11, 2008 housing crash, 2012 the false apocalypse and Covid-19 of the 2020s.¬† To my generation, none of these really made any difference in our lives as we were either too young to understand or too poor for a financial crisis to affect our ramen noodle diet.

‚ÄúYour location had been deemed an ideal spot for weary survivors to stop by to rest and strengthen their will to continue on their travels through the coming storm and as such, it is your responsibility to maintain the store with dignity, grace and courtesy.¬† For when the dark days come to an end, you shall be rewarded greatly for your efforts and be heralded as a hero!‚Äù¬† Cheered the voice as clearly A.I. generated vignettes of cooks and servers served Mad Max extras complete with explosions filling the windows.¬† ‚ÄúYou are to complete weekly training via these informational videos which are going to be vital not only to your survival, but also providing excellent customer service! You will receive periodic shipments of supplies to insure that our customers get only the best we can provide them during these trying times of hardship.¬† Be sure that you don‚Äôt take more than what you need, otherwise you will be terminated‚Ä¶ HAHA!‚Äù¬† The voice finished that particular spiel with an almost manic laugh.¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúI wonder what their definition of ‚Äòterminated‚Äô means during the apocalypse.‚Äù¬† I thought to myself before the video changed to a scene where an obese employee was gorging himself on bacon and pancakes, a gaunt family looked sadly at him through the window.¬† It wasn‚Äôt long before he was shot in the back of the head, spewing blood, brain matter and bone fragments across the table and window to the delight of the young children watching him.¬† The camera panned over to the shooter, revealing a suspiciously buff guy in a manager‚Äôs apron with an uncanny smile on his face before he holstered the strange pistol and pulled out a rag and broom.

‚ÄúAlrighty then.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúBeing as your craven coworkers have abandoned their sacred posts to be with their FaMiLiEs.‚Äù¬† The voice said with venom and sarcasm.¬† ‚ÄúYou are charged with being the sole defender of your new holy land, as such, we expect you to not leave your post for longer than the standard one hour per eight hours for your lunch break.‚Äù¬† It said, mimicking a certain popular mouse‚Äôs laugh at the end.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be fucking kidding me, this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù¬† I said incredulously.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you expect me to do?¬† Sleep here in the back room?!‚Äù¬† This was all far too ‚ÄúBethesda.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha! Yes!‚Äù¬† It said, seemingly in response to my question before continuing.¬† ‚ÄúThis may seem ridiculous at first, but rest assured that we are entirely serious, as proof we have provided your first adjusted check in the vhs case.¬† Please open the envelope now.‚Äù¬†¬†

Obeying the questionably sentient vhs tape, I picked up the case for the vhs tape and sure enough, there was an envelope that I hadn‚Äôt seen when I pulled the tape out.¬† I took my car keys out of my pocket and opened the envelope carefully at first until the paper just started ripping down the middle and I gave up all pretense of care and tore it the rest of the way open like a neanderthal.¬† Pulling the check out of the massacred envelope, I read the five digit sum after the supposed nonexistent government had taken its ‚Äúshare‚Äù and my mouth opened and closed like a gasping fish.

‚ÄúQuite the sum eh?‚Äù¬† Asked the voice cheekily.¬† ‚ÄúWell fear not, you will be fairly compensated to make yourself a comfortable man for whatever civilization rises from the ashes of the previous.¬† This shall conclude your introductory training course for this week, please flip the tape over to the other side and play me in one week's time or if you are ever in desperate times.¬† Remember, duty and grace!‚Äù¬† It said before the screen went black.

I contemplated leaving right then and there to deposit the huge sum and getting out of Dodge myself.¬† Then I realized I could just mobile deposit the check with my phone.¬† Then, as I was reaching for my pocket, I remembered the fallen soldier, drowned in puke and water that I had laid to rest in a bag of rice, hoping to revive him.¬† Then I shook my head and decided that I would go on about my day as normal and ride around town to see if I can‚Äôt find anyone around.

A few hours passed and I occasionally checked the stinky fried phone and eventually gave up on it before tossing it, still in the bag, in a drawer of Alice's desk.¬† By then, my relief, George, should have arrived but there was no sign of him nor anyone else for that matter.

‚ÄúWell there‚Äôs nothing else for it I guess.‚Äù¬† I said to the empty room.

I briefly thought about trying to lock the doors to the building but realized I had never seen any such key for the doors let alone possess one as the diner was supposed to be open 24 hours a day.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving now!‚Äù I shouted, into the void that was the diner.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer my fault if someone doesn‚Äôt come to their own shift!‚Äù¬† I waited for a response, nothing came.¬†

‚ÄúGoodnight!‚Äù¬† I said before leaving the building.

Before I got into my car, I heard a strange sound almost like a trumpet or train horn emit a single long tone before ceasing.¬† I hadn‚Äôt recalled being able to hear the train from this side of town but it was the only thing I could think of.¬† I drove down the still empty two lane road headed back towards town, I kept glancing at my rearview mirror, watching the unmoving line of cars on the overpass.¬† I couldn‚Äôt make out any forms in the vehicles.¬† What I did see were enormous black clouds rolling fast from the east and the strong wind that buffeted the trees.¬† I saw dogs and cats either roaming the empty roads or sitting in the driveways, waiting on something or someone.¬† Something else was bothering me and I couldn‚Äôt place it until I got to the first red light and the light was out, the intersection was empty save for me so I just went on by.¬† The storm was rolling in fast now and the light of the sun was dimming to a drab gray, usually the street lights would have turned on by now, but they seemed to be on the fritz as well.¬† I idly wondered at how early we lost power seeing as the storm hadn‚Äôt even really gotten to the small town, but yet there wasn‚Äôt a single light in town that I could see.¬† I pulled into the local bank to cash out half the check and deposit the rest but the parking lot was empty and the lights were off as well.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhere the fuck is everybody at?‚Äù¬† I wondered, thinking I might have missed an evacuation order from last night.

Figuring there was nothing for it, I headed back to my humble abode that was my motel room on the same road the Pancake House was on.¬† It was on the seedier side of town and there was at least one form of degenerate hanging around the busy corner with a sign or hiked up skirt but not even the local homeless seemed to be home.¬†¬†

As I was pulling into the parking lot of the motel, it started coming down the rain blistering the air as it was shot down by the storm, it felt like I was in an enormous car wash.

‚ÄúOf course it starts raining right when I‚Äôm about to get out of the car.‚Äù¬† I mumbled unhappily.

¬†I thought that would be the worst of it as the rain stung my skin as I ran to the safety of my door but halfway there, I started hearing wet and heavy splotching sounds all around me like paper bags filled with jello falling to the floor.¬† One such splotch landed directly in front of me and I saw that it was a fat frog, or at least used to be a frog.¬† The sudden arrival of the concrete sidewalk in the middle of its terminal velocity flight appeared to have bested the poor creature.¬†¬†

‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ!‚Äù¬† I yelled as more splotches hit the ground and a shock of lightning struck in the distance marking my profane vulgarity.

I spared no time trying to guess how the frogs were yeeted at such speeds, instead, doubling my efforts at reaching the safety of my room.¬† I threw open the door to the shitty room and slammed it shut against the howling wind and nightmare inducing ‚Äúsplotching.‚Äù¬† I opened the curtains to the big pane glass window that looked over the parking lot and I saw the hundreds of little green bodies scattered throughout the area, their blood mixing into the rain water making a brown slurry of foul and would surely smell like hell once the storm passed.

‚ÄúWhat in the hell is going on?‚Äù¬† I thought, the sight of it all making me speechless.

I desperately tried to rationalize the situation, I was bordering the south and was sort of nearish to several bodies of water.¬† Hadn‚Äôt I heard of water spouts or tornadoes launching frogs and fish into the sky before?¬† If that was the case, there was surely going to be a lot of very happy birds and some pissed off DNR guy wondering where all his wildlife had been raptured to.¬† Something in my gut told me this wasn‚Äôt so mundane as a freak act of nature but my devoutly agnostic mind refused to give in and willfully chose to ignore this in favor of getting blitzed out of my gourd.

I turned to the pig sty of a room Past Mick had left for Future Mick to deal with knowing full well that neither would have to deal with the mess as Present Mick would, like always, be left with the shit end of the stick that neither of the other versions of myself seemed to end up with.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhere has my weed gone.‚Äù¬† I said in a goblin like tone, searching through all the nooks and crannies of the nest.

I eventually found my grinder and half a joint next to a thoroughly gunked pipe, so, lighting the joint I methodically cleaned the pipe and filled it back up with the rest of my precious herbs.¬† This specific strain was called ‚ÄúForbidden Fruit,‚Äù which obviously made it sound like it would be ‚Äúfruity‚Äù but just ended up tasting like every other weed strain I had tried.¬† The shit was REALLY good on the other hand and before I had even lit up the pipe, I was well on my way of completing my quest of becoming blitz. ¬† That‚Äôs when I heard a strange noise coming from the exterior door.¬† It was a sort of ‚Äúthump-flisch-pause-thump-flisch‚Äù which intrigued my addled mind to no end.

In what I thought was an excellent Sherlock Holmes impression, I said.¬† ‚ÄúI must find out what is making that strange noise I do say!‚Äù before giggling to myself.

The journey to the door was long but I eventually made it and opened the door to reveal no one.¬† Then something hit my leg and I nearly jumped out of my skin as my gaze landed on an enormous Bull Frog.¬† I screamed like a little girl and jumped back into the threshold of my sanctuary.

‚ÄúHey calm it down won‚Äôchya?‚Äù¬† Said the Frog in a (Boston?) accent.

This of course sent me into another tizzy and it was official, my vibe was thoroughly harshed.

‚ÄúI said calm down, not cry like a sissy.¬† Now what‚Äôs a guy gotta do to get some good grub in this joint, eh?‚Äù¬† Asked the ridiculous little creature.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬† I began to ask as I peered over the sideways couch that had been overturned in my full blown retreat from the invader.

‚ÄúNevermind, I can see the buffet you‚Äôve laid out so helpfully.‚Äù¬† He said before bounding into the little kitchen area where there were indeed a hoard of flies circling the overflowing trash can.

The large frog was like a mix between an anti air gun from the WWII documentaries I used to watch in college and a cowboy with his magic lasso that caught everything it was thrown at. ¬† Within minutes, the Bull Frog had wiped out the generations of flies that had built up over the past months.

‚ÄúMuch obliged Mick, you are indeed a kind host if I do say so myself.‚Äù¬† The frog said as he made his way back over to me, hopping from one piece of furniture to another.

‚ÄúTh-thank you?‚Äù I stammered.¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here¬† Mr.-‚Äù

‚ÄúFrank, Frank the Fucking Frog at your service but you can just call me Fank for short.‚Äù¬† He said, finishing my sentence and bowing at his full name.

‚ÄúWell, Frank, what uh what seems to bring you to my humble abode.‚Äù¬† I squeeked.

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm your trip sitter bro, and after you sober up you gotta get back to the Pancake House.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait what?‚Äù¬† I asked incredulously.

‚ÄúYou gotta get back to work numbfuck.¬† Don‚Äôt you remember that weird ass vhs tape?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did-‚Äù¬† I began but my addled brain was not in any shape ready to go down a line of questioning with this frog.¬† I decided, for now, to just chill out with the strange frog, at least for now.

I righted the furniture that I had knocked over and gathered the pipe that had miraculously not lost its cargo in the commotion.¬† We sat there in silence for a while, I looked out the window at the storm while we puff puff passed.¬† Rain came down like a shower from the heavens washing the world‚Äôs sins down the storm drains to join filth we flush out of our houses.¬† The storm was picking up again, wind was violently whipping trees, trash cans were rolling down the streets and I even saw a trampoline fly over one of the houses.

‚ÄúI gotta admit, you‚Äôre handling this a lot better than I thought you was going to.‚Äù¬† Said Frank after a while.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬† I asked, taken off guard by the sudden statement.

‚ÄúGod you aren‚Äôt the quickest one are you?‚Äù¬† He replied.¬† ‚ÄúListen, you really gotta get back to your work as soon as you can.¬† They‚Äôll let this first instance to go by without punishment but if you stay out too long, they‚Äôll have to do something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?¬† Who‚Äôs they?‚Äù¬† I asked, interrupting him.

‚ÄúFor the love of God and all that is holy I‚Äôm trying to explain that to you you feckless fuck.‚Äù¬† He said sharply and turning a hairy (slimy? scaly?) eye on me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just having a little trouble taking all this in seeing as you‚Äôre a fucking talking frog!¬† Now please enlighten me, shitty Kermit.‚Äù¬† I said hotly.

Frank seemed to take a breath to calm himself.¬† ‚ÄúPancake House needs you to do your job and to not leave the diner except on your OSHA mandated breaks, otherwise you are not going to like what they do to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck do they care about OSHA?‚Äù¬† I asked.

‚ÄúHO-LEE FUCK.¬† Listen to me fucker!‚Äù¬† He practically screamed.¬† ‚ÄúGo, stay I don‚Äôt give a fuck.¬† I‚Äôm outta here, I held up my end of the bargain.‚Äù¬† He said before storming to the door and jumping on the doorhandle, which allowed the door to swing open from the wind.¬†¬†

I sprung to my feet and fought to close the door and when I eventually did, I looked around and out the window but Frank was nowhere to be seen and I was no longer high.

I looked around the dark room again and sighed to myself.

‚ÄúAt least the Pancake House has power.‚Äù¬† I thought, ‚ÄúI could at least ride out the storm there until the power comes back on in town using the back up generators.‚Äù

So, I gathered up my meager belongings and braved the storm once again, dodging frogs as best I could.¬† In case you're wondering, driving down a road slick with frog bodies is not pleasant to say the least but I was soon pulling into the Pancake House Parking lot for the second time that day.¬† There wasn‚Äôt any sign of Cain outside and assumingly went inside to at least get out of the rain.¬†

Cain was indeed in the dining area, drinking a cup of coffee and he had guests.¬† He was seated at one of the booths playing cards with a family of raccoons?

‚ÄúHey Mick.‚Äù¬† Said Cain distractedly.

I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure if anything I was experiencing recently was even real so I decided to not engage with the odd scene and instead made my way to the back.¬† To my surprise, there was a freshly made cot large enough for me to sleep on more or less comfortably.

‚ÄúI guess this is home for now.‚Äù¬† I said, setting my belongings in the office and arranging the bedding.

For about the first week we didn‚Äôt see a single soul nor did the rain let up at all; the streets were absolutely flooded at this point and I was surprised that the store hadn‚Äôt been flooded either. ¬† I entertained myself by cooking for Cain and myself, journaling and stealing cigarettes from the Sergeant Dollar next door.¬† I was going to eventually hit the gas station as I had already used up all of my favorite products.

Finally, during one of the evening shifts, I was sitting in the kitchen with my feet propped on another stool while bouncing a ball off the ceiling when I heard the door chime open and the muted sound of the storm became clearer.¬† I got up in such a hurry that both chairs toppled over and I smacked the ball right into one of the circular lights that dangled over the counter.¬†¬†

	‚ÄúJesus Fu - I mean, Welcome to Pancake House!‚Äù¬† I blurted out while fumbling with the chairs.¬†¬†

	Standing in the doorway was an older man with dark skin and the first hint of grey on an unshaven beard along with two dark skinned girls, the older looking preteens and the younger no older than nine.¬† The small family looked surprised and a little startled at my appearance and the father stepped forward in front of the two young girls.

	‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want no trouble now, we were just looking for some food.‚Äù¬† Said the man with just a hint of a southern accent.

	‚ÄúWell you‚Äôve come to the right place my friend.‚Äù¬† I said with what I had hoped to be a disarming smile and waved at the two girls.¬† ‚ÄúThis Pancake House location is still open and running and I would be more than happy to cook for you guys.‚Äù

	‚ÄúAre you serious?¬† I mean I know the old joke about the ‚ÄúPancake House Index‚Äù but y‚Äôall are staying open?¬† In this?‚Äù¬† He gestured vaguely to the apocalyptic storm behind him.¬†¬†

	‚ÄúWell sir, if I‚Äôm being completely honest, I thought it was crazy too, but they‚Äôre betting on the long game and I guess I am too.‚Äù

	‚ÄúOookay then, I have some cash-‚Äù

	‚ÄúYou got any smokes?‚Äù¬† I asked, cutting him off in my haste to quench my addiction.

	Taken slightly aback, the man unconsciously reached into his jacket pocket, ‚ÄúY-yeah I‚Äôve got some wintergreen dip, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after.‚Äù

	Only slightly disheartened by the lack of cigarettes I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got yourself a deal Mr‚Ä¶.‚Äù

	‚ÄúCall me Marcus,‚Äù Marcus said, handing me a can of Copenhagen Wintergreen.

	‚ÄúPleasure doing business with you Marcus, I‚Äôm Mick.‚Äù¬† I said cheerily.

	‚ÄúSo where are y‚Äôall from?‚Äù¬† I asked as I cooked healthy portions of bacon, eggs and a large stack of pancakes for everyone.¬†

	‚ÄúSavannah, we‚Äôre from Savannah, Georgia.‚Äù¬†¬†

	‚ÄúDo you mind if I ask how it is over there?¬† And what it‚Äôs like out there in general?‚Äù

	Hesitantly, Macus said, ‚ÄúWell I guess I could tell you our story, it‚Äôs the least I could do for the first hot meal we‚Äôve had in days.‚Äù

	‚ÄúEat your fill first, then you can tell me if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù¬† I said setting plates down in front of hungry faces.¬†¬†

	Marcus didn‚Äôt verbally respond but nodded his head as he chowed down on bacon.

	Cain, out of curiosity or boredom, decided to grace us with his presence wearing a komodo robe, fluffy bunny slippers, ‚ÄúJUICY‚Äù sweatpants that were absolutely drenched and a cane with a golden animal head as a handle.

	Marcus eyed the man suspiciously and his hand went tense on his thigh, the girls avoided looking at the admittedly strange man.¬† Cain, for the first time since I‚Äôd known him, read the room and sat a polite distance away and warmed his hands around a cup of coffee.

	Driving down the mostly deserted street, I finished my cheap motel coffee, tasting the even cheaper whiskey, burning my throat and igniting a fire in my stomach.¬† I crested a rise in the road and saw two of the most iconic signs known to people throughout the southeastern portion of the United States.¬† Two signs with black letters on yellow backgrounds filled the horizon ‚ÄúS E R G E A N T D O L L A R‚Äù and ‚ÄúP A N C A K E H O U S E.‚Äù¬† I parked my Jeep Cherokee in the spot next to the dumpsters on the side of the Pancake House and flicked the cigarette in the general direction of the trash can.¬† As I opened the door an empty beer can rolled out and tumbled across the pavement.¬† I sighed, bent over and picked it up, tossing it into the dumpster before anyone could see.¬† The sun hadn‚Äôt quite made it over the horizon yet but was still too bright for my hung over eyes.¬† Blinking away a splitting headache, I noticed that the parking lot was empty, not even my manager‚Äôs car was parked by the back door.¬† I looked inside the diner and saw that the kitchen and dining room was empty.

	‚ÄúWhat the fuck?‚Äù¬† I said in confusion.

	Then I heard some rustling by the dumpster and saw the scraggily head of Cain pop out from behind one with scrambled eggs on his beard.¬† Cain was our resident crackhead that we allowed to kick it at the dumpster and occasionally fed him the extra food we had at the end of shifts in exchange for keeping away less savory crackheads.¬† He wasn‚Äôt the biggest guy around but you know what they say about the size of a dog in a fight and it surely fit Cain, he was a right bastard.

	‚ÄúHey!‚Äù¬† I called out to Cain, ‚ÄúWhere the hell is everybody?‚Äù

	Cain turned and studied the diner, ‚ÄúI dunno.‚Äù¬† Then he turned back to his scrounging.

	‚ÄúThanks for the help dick.‚Äù¬† I muttered before making my way inside the building and double checking that my car was locked.

	As I walked from the back room towards the front the sounds and smells of a kitchen invaded my senses.¬† The smell of oil, bacon and coffee filled my nose and twinged my unsettled stomach.¬† My feet slid ever so slightly as a mix of dish water, mop water and grease covered the chipped tile floor.¬† The hanging lights over the bar were still lit and all the flat surfaces were clean and spotless, there did seem to appear to be a mess behind the counter where someone dropped a plate of food and just left it for me to clean.

	‚ÄúFucking night shift.‚Äù¬† I muttered, grabbing a broom and mop.

	I idly wondered where my coworkers were at and hoped I hadn‚Äôt missed something important.¬† I really wish I hadn‚Äôt dropped my phone in the toilet full of puke the night prior so I couldn‚Äôt even text or call anyone.¬† After cleaning the mess, I let my body go through the familiar task of setting up for the day while my mind entered a pseudo meditative state where I thought of leaving and moving on to the next small town like I had been doing for the past few years.

	After about an hour, I finished all my opening duties and the duties of my still missing coworkers and really began to think that something was off.¬† Cain was usually one of the first people I saw everyday but he‚Äôs never been the **only** person I saw.¬† Come to think of it, I didn‚Äôt even see any cars on the small but (comparatively) highly trafficked road to the interstate right outside of the small town.¬† I went outside for a cigarette and I could definitely see tons of cars moving slowly down the interstate which made me feel a little better.¬†¬†

	‚ÄúMaybe there was a bad accident and that‚Äôs caused everyone to be late.‚Äù¬† I said to myself knowing full well at least Alice, my manager, lived in town not too far from the motel I stayed at.¬†¬†

	I made my way back inside and set to cooking myself some breakfast, seeing as no one was around to stop me or judge my voracious appetite.¬† Apparently, I wasn‚Äôt the only one that had this idea, as I had just plated myself a ‚ÄúTexas Pancake Melt‚Äù and double chunked, peppered and covered hashbrowns when Cain walked in, hesitantly looking around.¬†¬†

Sighing, I said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs alright Cain, c‚Äômon in.¬† Want pancakes?‚Äù

He nodded and took a seat at the bar while I set to cooking him pancakes and filled a fresh pot of coffee for the two of us.¬† We didn‚Äôt usually let Cain inside or near the entrance during busy hours as he would harass exiting patrons for change and lick his lips at pigeons that lined the roof of our building.¬† The last time Cain had come in, he had blatantly taken half eaten food off of people‚Äôs plates and, in one case, took a french fry from a child‚Äôs hand.¬† Before long however, we were sharing a meal together in only slightly uncomfortable silence staring at the cracked brown tile and pictures of the original ‚ÄúPancake House‚Äù and owner.

‚ÄúSoo, ya‚Äôlike cooking boy?‚Äù¬† He said in his raspy (scottish?) accent.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not the worst job I‚Äôve had, certainly not the hardest or easiest but I never go hungry.‚Äù¬† I winced, looking at the frail frame of Cain but he didn‚Äôt seem to take offence to the faux pas.

‚ÄúHad many jobs?‚Äù¬† He asked.

‚ÄúI suppose,¬† been around and worked around.¬† I was in college then moved to oil work, pipe laying, circus clown here and a ranch hand there.‚Äù¬†¬†

Cain nodded his head and raised his eyebrows in appreciation.

‚ÄúHave- you had many jobs?‚Äù¬† I asked, stumbling not sure how to ask or if to ask the question.

‚ÄúNope.‚Äù¬† He said simply. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fought for, been fucked for or stole everything I‚Äôve ever had.‚Äù

Coffee shot into my nose at his casualness of that statement and Cain laughed at my discomfort.

‚ÄúBut, like you said, this gig ain‚Äôt too bad for me neither.¬† I fight for my dumpster and I get the occasional full pancake and hot cup of coffee.‚Äù¬† He said with a pleased smile that showed off his whole three teeth.

‚ÄúWell, where do you think everyone is at?‚Äù¬† I asked, blatantly changing the topic

‚ÄúLike I said earlier lad, I haven‚Äôt got the foggiest of fucking clues.¬† It‚Äôs not like I've got a phone or nuffin.¬† But, I did hear quit the fucking racket when all those stars fell from the sky but that was after I shot up so that‚Äôs a wash if it was real or not.‚Äù

I searched my foggy memory of last night trying to think of any ‚Äòstars falling‚Äô but all I could remember was a pretty caramel face, brown curls and an unearthly color growing from the depths that made me feel nauseous when I thought of it.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know,‚Äù¬† I said eventually. ‚ÄúI was plastered last night so I can‚Äôt exactly prove you wrong.‚Äù

We continued the rest of our meal in silence until Cain stood up from his stool.¬† ‚ÄúWell thank you for sharing a meal with me Mick, makes me feel like a man again but I got a couple of chores to do around the ole‚Äô abode.‚Äù

‚ÄúUh yeah, no problem Cain.¬† Guess I‚Äôll see you later.‚Äù¬† I said thinking of what kind of chores a crackhead has to do in a dumpster.

For the rest of the day, not a single soul got off the interstate.¬† No one entered the diner, the Sergeant Dollar behind the diner or the gas station across the street.¬† I noticed on one of my smoke breaks that neither store appeared to be open.¬† That made me anxious as I was running low on cigs and the Sergeant Dollar was the only place that got frequent shipments of Reds.¬† When I came back into the diner from that smoke break, there was an old box television and vcr on a cart in the middle of the kitchen.

‚ÄúNow what the fuck is this?‚Äù¬† I asked to the empty room.

I once again explored the diner and found no one inside and double checked the parking lot for a car and only saw my red Cherokee.¬† I went back inside and checked out the anomalous cart and found on top of the vcr was a vhs tape labelled, ‚ÄúThe Pancake House Apocalypse Guide.‚Äù¬† With growing confusion, I rolled the cart to the back office and plugged the ancient technology into an outlet and played the vhs tape, reminding me of when I was a kid at my grandparents‚Äô house watching old westerns.¬† The screen flickered green for a moment and went through the customary legal disclaimers and then the Pancake House company logo and my heart dropped, fearing a training video filled with monotone monologues and washed up 90s sitcom actors.¬† The screen flicked to a still photo of the exterior of a Pancake House and a tinny pompous male voice came out of the speakers.¬†

‚ÄúCongratulations loyal employee of the Pancake House corporation!¬† You have been selected to be a part of an elite cooking team to happily serve the weary survivors in the coming apocalypse!‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat the fuck.‚Äù¬† I said for the third (fourth?) time today.

‚ÄúAs you know Pancake House has held a long tradition to stay open 24/7 365 days a year rain or shine in as many locations as possible.¬† In the past, we have implemented Jump Teams to aid areas under natural disasters, well that has evolved into Star Teams because you sir are a **star!**‚Äù¬†¬†

I idly thought about the likelihood of this being some elaborate prank by my coworkers because there was no way a corporation in the 2020s was going to use a definitive gender noun rather than a gender neutral one, no matter how tiresome it became.

‚ÄúIn these unprecedented times, we ask you, the best of our very best, to serve your company to the best of your abilities and we will provide you with everything you shall need.¬† The rest of this guide shall guide you through the apocalypse with ease and shall become your new holy doctrine.‚Äù

I rolled my eyes at hearing the cheery voice utter ‚Äúunprecedented,‚Äù I was so tired of hearing that fucking word.¬† It seemed like at every turn in my life there was another ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù event that would ‚Äúirrevocably‚Äù change the world.¬† Y2k, 9/11, 2008 housing crash, 2012 the false apocalypse and Covid-19 of the 2020s.¬† To my generation, none of these really made any difference in our lives as we were either too young to understand or too poor for a financial crisis to affect our ramen noodle diet.

‚ÄúYour location had been deemed an ideal spot for weary survivors to stop by to rest and strengthen their will to continue on their travels through the coming storm and as such, it is your responsibility to maintain the store with dignity, grace and courtesy.¬† For when the dark days come to an end, you shall be rewarded greatly for your efforts and be heralded as a hero!‚Äù¬† Cheered the voice as clearly A.I. generated vignettes of cooks and servers served Mad Max extras complete with explosions filling the windows.¬† ‚ÄúYou are to complete weekly training via these informational videos which are going to be vital not only to your survival, but also providing excellent customer service! You will receive periodic shipments of supplies to insure that our customers get only the best we can provide them during these trying times of hardship.¬† Be sure that you don‚Äôt take more than what you need, otherwise you will be terminated‚Ä¶ HAHA!‚Äù¬† The voice finished that particular spiel with an almost manic laugh.¬†¬†¬†¬†

‚ÄúI wonder what their definition of ‚Äòterminated‚Äô means during the apocalypse.‚Äù¬† I thought to myself before the video changed to a scene where an obese employee was gorging himself on bacon and pancakes, a gaunt family looked sadly at him through the window.¬† It wasn‚Äôt long before he was shot in the back of the head, spewing blood, brain matter and bone fragments across the table and window to the delight of the young children watching him.¬† The camera panned over to the shooter, revealing a suspiciously buff guy in a manager‚Äôs apron with an uncanny smile on his face before he holstered the strange pistol and pulled out a rag and broom.

‚ÄúAlrighty then.‚Äù¬†¬†

‚ÄúBeing as your craven coworkers have abandoned their sacred posts to be with their FaMiLiEs.‚Äù¬† The voice said with venom and sarcasm.¬† ‚ÄúYou are charged with being the sole defender of your new holy land, as such, we expect you to not leave your post for longer than the standard one hour per eight hours for your lunch break.‚Äù¬† It said, mimicking a certain popular mouse‚Äôs laugh at the end.

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got to be fucking kidding me, this can‚Äôt be real.‚Äù¬† I said incredulously.¬† ‚ÄúWhat do you expect me to do?¬† Sleep here in the back room?!‚Äù¬† This was all far too ‚ÄúBethesda.‚Äù

‚ÄúHaha! Yes!‚Äù¬† It said, seemingly in response to my question before continuing.¬† ‚ÄúThis may seem ridiculous at first, but rest assured that we are entirely serious, as proof we have provided your first adjusted check in the vhs case.¬† Please open the envelope now.‚Äù¬†¬†

Obeying the questionably sentient vhs tape, I picked up the case for the vhs tape and sure enough, there was an envelope that I hadn‚Äôt seen when I pulled the tape out.¬† I took my car keys out of my pocket and opened the envelope carefully at first until the paper just started ripping down the middle and I gave up all pretense of care and tore it the rest of the way open like a neanderthal.¬† Pulling the check out of the massacred envelope, I read the five digit sum after the supposed nonexistent government had taken its ‚Äúshare‚Äù and my mouth opened and closed like a gasping fish.

‚ÄúQuite the sum eh?‚Äù¬† Asked the voice cheekily.¬† ‚ÄúWell fear not, you will be fairly compensated to make yourself a comfortable man for whatever civilization rises from the ashes of the previous.¬† This shall conclude your introductory training course for this week, please flip the tape over to the other side and play me in one week's time or if you are ever in desperate times.¬† Remember, duty and grace!‚Äù¬† It said before the screen went black.

I contemplated leaving right then and there to deposit the huge sum and getting out of Dodge myself.¬† Then I realized I could just mobile deposit the check with my phone.¬† Then, as I was reaching for my pocket, I remembered the fallen soldier, drowned in puke and water that I had laid to rest in a bag of rice, hoping to revive him.¬† Then I shook my head and decided that I would go on about my day as normal and ride around town to see if I can‚Äôt find anyone around.

A few hours passed and I occasionally checked the stinky fried phone and eventually gave up on it before tossing it, still in the bag, in a drawer of Alice's desk.¬† By then, my relief, George, should have arrived but there was no sign of him nor anyone else for that matter.

‚ÄúWell there‚Äôs nothing else for it I guess.‚Äù¬† I said to the empty room.

I briefly thought about trying to lock the doors to the building but realized I had never seen any such key for the doors let alone possess one as the diner was supposed to be open 24 hours a day.¬†¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving now!‚Äù I shouted, into the void that was the diner.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer my fault if someone doesn‚Äôt come to their own shift!‚Äù¬† I waited for a response, nothing came.¬†

‚ÄúGoodnight!‚Äù¬† I said before leaving the building.

Before I got into my car, I heard a strange sound almost like a trumpet or train horn emit a single long tone before ceasing.¬† I hadn‚Äôt recalled being able to hear the train from this side of town but it was the only thing I could think of.¬† I drove down the still empty two lane road headed back towards town, I kept glancing at my rearview mirror, watching the unmoving line of cars on the overpass.¬† I couldn‚Äôt make out any forms in the vehicles.¬† What I did see were enormous black clouds rolling fast from the east and the strong wind that buffeted the trees.¬† I saw dogs and cats either roaming the empty roads or sitting in the driveways, waiting on something or someone.¬† Something else was bothering me and I couldn‚Äôt place it until I got to the first red light and the light was out, the intersection was empty save for me so I just went on by.¬† The storm was rolling in fast now and the light of the sun was dimming to a drab gray, usually the street lights would have turned on by now, but they seemed to be on the fritz as well.¬† I idly wondered at how early we lost power seeing as the storm hadn‚Äôt even really gotten to the small town, but yet there wasn‚Äôt a single light in town that I could see.¬† I pulled into the local bank to cash out half the check and deposit the rest but the parking lot was empty and the lights were off as well.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhere the fuck is everybody at?‚Äù¬† I wondered, thinking I might have missed an evacuation order from last night.

Figuring there was nothing for it, I headed back to my humble abode that was my motel room on the same road the Pancake House was on.¬† It was on the seedier side of town and there was at least one form of degenerate hanging around the busy corner with a sign or hiked up skirt but not even the local homeless seemed to be home.¬†¬†

As I was pulling into the parking lot of the motel, it started coming down the rain blistering the air as it was shot down by the storm, it felt like I was in an enormous car wash.

‚ÄúOf course it starts raining right when I‚Äôm about to get out of the car.‚Äù¬† I mumbled unhappily.

¬†I thought that would be the worst of it as the rain stung my skin as I ran to the safety of my door but halfway there, I started hearing wet and heavy splotching sounds all around me like paper bags filled with jello falling to the floor.¬† One such splotch landed directly in front of me and I saw that it was a fat frog, or at least used to be a frog.¬† The sudden arrival of the concrete sidewalk in the middle of its terminal velocity flight appeared to have bested the poor creature.¬†¬†

‚ÄúJesus fucking Christ!‚Äù¬† I yelled as more splotches hit the ground and a shock of lightning struck in the distance marking my profane vulgarity.

I spared no time trying to guess how the frogs were yeeted at such speeds, instead, doubling my efforts at reaching the safety of my room.¬† I threw open the door to the shitty room and slammed it shut against the howling wind and nightmare inducing ‚Äúsplotching.‚Äù¬† I opened the curtains to the big pane glass window that looked over the parking lot and I saw the hundreds of little green bodies scattered throughout the area, their blood mixing into the rain water making a brown slurry of foul and would surely smell like hell once the storm passed.

‚ÄúWhat in the hell is going on?‚Äù¬† I thought, the sight of it all making me speechless.

I desperately tried to rationalize the situation, I was bordering the south and was sort of nearish to several bodies of water.¬† Hadn‚Äôt I heard of water spouts or tornadoes launching frogs and fish into the sky before?¬† If that was the case, there was surely going to be a lot of very happy birds and some pissed off DNR guy wondering where all his wildlife had been raptured to.¬† Something in my gut told me this wasn‚Äôt so mundane as a freak act of nature but my devoutly agnostic mind refused to give in and willfully chose to ignore this in favor of getting blitzed out of my gourd.

I turned to the pig sty of a room Past Mick had left for Future Mick to deal with knowing full well that neither would have to deal with the mess as Present Mick would, like always, be left with the shit end of the stick that neither of the other versions of myself seemed to end up with.¬†¬†

‚ÄúWhere has my weed gone.‚Äù¬† I said in a goblin like tone, searching through all the nooks and crannies of the nest.

I eventually found my grinder and half a joint next to a thoroughly gunked pipe, so, lighting the joint I methodically cleaned the pipe and filled it back up with the rest of my precious herbs.¬† This specific strain was called ‚ÄúForbidden Fruit,‚Äù which obviously made it sound like it would be ‚Äúfruity‚Äù but just ended up tasting like every other weed strain I had tried.¬† The shit was REALLY good on the other hand and before I had even lit up the pipe, I was well on my way of completing my quest of becoming blitz. ¬† That‚Äôs when I heard a strange noise coming from the exterior door.¬† It was a sort of ‚Äúthump-flisch-pause-thump-flisch‚Äù which intrigued my addled mind to no end.

In what I thought was an excellent Sherlock Holmes impression, I said.¬† ‚ÄúI must find out what is making that strange noise I do say!‚Äù before giggling to myself.

The journey to the door was long but I eventually made it and opened the door to reveal no one.¬† Then something hit my leg and I nearly jumped out of my skin as my gaze landed on an enormous Bull Frog.¬† I screamed like a little girl and jumped back into the threshold of my sanctuary.

‚ÄúHey calm it down won‚Äôchya?‚Äù¬† Said the Frog in a (Boston?) accent.

This of course sent me into another tizzy and it was official, my vibe was thoroughly harshed.

‚ÄúI said calm down, not cry like a sissy.¬† Now what‚Äôs a guy gotta do to get some good grub in this joint, eh?‚Äù¬† Asked the ridiculous little creature.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬† I began to ask as I peered over the sideways couch that had been overturned in my full blown retreat from the invader.

‚ÄúNevermind, I can see the buffet you‚Äôve laid out so helpfully.‚Äù¬† He said before bounding into the little kitchen area where there were indeed a hoard of flies circling the overflowing trash can.

The large frog was like a mix between an anti air gun from the WWII documentaries I used to watch in college and a cowboy with his magic lasso that caught everything it was thrown at. ¬† Within minutes, the Bull Frog had wiped out the generations of flies that had built up over the past months.

‚ÄúMuch obliged Mick, you are indeed a kind host if I do say so myself.‚Äù¬† The frog said as he made his way back over to me, hopping from one piece of furniture to another.

‚ÄúTh-thank you?‚Äù I stammered.¬† ‚ÄúWhat are you doing here¬† Mr.-‚Äù

‚ÄúFrank, Frank the Fucking Frog at your service but you can just call me Fank for short.‚Äù¬† He said, finishing my sentence and bowing at his full name.

‚ÄúWell, Frank, what uh what seems to bring you to my humble abode.‚Äù¬† I squeeked.

‚ÄúOh I‚Äôm your trip sitter bro, and after you sober up you gotta get back to the Pancake House.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait what?‚Äù¬† I asked incredulously.

‚ÄúYou gotta get back to work numbfuck.¬† Don‚Äôt you remember that weird ass vhs tape?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow did-‚Äù¬† I began but my addled brain was not in any shape ready to go down a line of questioning with this frog.¬† I decided, for now, to just chill out with the strange frog, at least for now.

I righted the furniture that I had knocked over and gathered the pipe that had miraculously not lost its cargo in the commotion.¬† We sat there in silence for a while, I looked out the window at the storm while we puff puff passed.¬† Rain came down like a shower from the heavens washing the world‚Äôs sins down the storm drains to join filth we flush out of our houses.¬† The storm was picking up again, wind was violently whipping trees, trash cans were rolling down the streets and I even saw a trampoline fly over one of the houses.

‚ÄúI gotta admit, you‚Äôre handling this a lot better than I thought you was going to.‚Äù¬† Said Frank after a while.

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù¬† I asked, taken off guard by the sudden statement.

‚ÄúGod you aren‚Äôt the quickest one are you?‚Äù¬† He replied.¬† ‚ÄúListen, you really gotta get back to your work as soon as you can.¬† They‚Äôll let this first instance to go by without punishment but if you stay out too long, they‚Äôll have to do something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean?¬† Who‚Äôs they?‚Äù¬† I asked, interrupting him.

‚ÄúFor the love of God and all that is holy I‚Äôm trying to explain that to you you feckless fuck.‚Äù¬† He said sharply and turning a hairy (slimy? scaly?) eye on me.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm just having a little trouble taking all this in seeing as you‚Äôre a fucking talking frog!¬† Now please enlighten me, shitty Kermit.‚Äù¬† I said hotly.

Frank seemed to take a breath to calm himself.¬† ‚ÄúPancake House needs you to do your job and to not leave the diner except on your OSHA mandated breaks, otherwise you are not going to like what they do to you.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy the fuck do they care about OSHA?‚Äù¬† I asked.

‚ÄúHO-LEE FUCK.¬† Listen to me fucker!‚Äù¬† He practically screamed.¬† ‚ÄúGo, stay I don‚Äôt give a fuck.¬† I‚Äôm outta here, I held up my end of the bargain.‚Äù¬† He said before storming to the door and jumping on the doorhandle, which allowed the door to swing open from the wind.¬†¬†

I sprung to my feet and fought to close the door and when I eventually did, I looked around and out the window but Frank was nowhere to be seen and I was no longer high.

I looked around the dark room again and sighed to myself.

‚ÄúAt least the Pancake House has power.‚Äù¬† I thought, ‚ÄúI could at least ride out the storm there until the power comes back on in town using the back up generators.‚Äù

So, I gathered up my meager belongings and braved the storm once again, dodging frogs as best I could.¬† In case you're wondering, driving down a road slick with frog bodies is not pleasant to say the least but I was soon pulling into the Pancake House Parking lot for the second time that day.¬† There wasn‚Äôt any sign of Cain outside and assumingly went inside to at least get out of the rain.¬†

Cain was indeed in the dining area, drinking a cup of coffee and he had guests.¬† He was seated at one of the booths playing cards with a family of raccoons?

‚ÄúHey Mick.‚Äù¬† Said Cain distractedly.

I wasn‚Äôt entirely sure if anything I was experiencing recently was even real so I decided to not engage with the odd scene and instead made my way to the back.¬† To my surprise, there was a freshly made cot large enough for me to sleep on more or less comfortably.

‚ÄúI guess this is home for now.‚Äù¬† I said, setting my belongings in the office and arranging the bedding.

For about the first week we didn‚Äôt see a single soul nor did the rain let up at all; the streets were absolutely flooded at this point and I was surprised that the store hadn‚Äôt been flooded either. ¬† I entertained myself by cooking for Cain and myself, journaling and stealing cigarettes from the Sergeant Dollar next door.¬† I was going to eventually hit the gas station as I had already used up all of my favorite products.

Finally, during one of the evening shifts, I was sitting in the kitchen with my feet propped on another stool while bouncing a ball off the ceiling when I heard the door chime open and the muted sound of the storm became clearer.¬† I got up in such a hurry that both chairs toppled over and I smacked the ball right into one of the circular lights that dangled over the counter.¬†¬†

	‚ÄúJesus Fu - I mean, Welcome to Pancake House!‚Äù¬† I blurted out while fumbling with the chairs.¬†¬†

	Standing in the doorway was an older man with dark skin and the first hint of grey on an unshaven beard along with two dark skinned girls, the older looking preteens and the younger no older than nine.¬† The small family looked surprised and a little startled at my appearance and the father stepped forward in front of the two young girls.

	‚ÄúWe don‚Äôt want no trouble now, we were just looking for some food.‚Äù¬† Said the man with just a hint of a southern accent.

	‚ÄúWell you‚Äôve come to the right place my friend.‚Äù¬† I said with what I had hoped to be a disarming smile and waved at the two girls.¬† ‚ÄúThis Pancake House location is still open and running and I would be more than happy to cook for you guys.‚Äù

	‚ÄúAre you serious?¬† I mean I know the old joke about the ‚ÄúPancake House Index‚Äù but y‚Äôall are staying open?¬† In this?‚Äù¬† He gestured vaguely to the apocalyptic storm behind him.¬†¬†

	‚ÄúWell sir, if I‚Äôm being completely honest, I thought it was crazy too, but they‚Äôre betting on the long game and I guess I am too.‚Äù

	‚ÄúOookay then, I have some cash-‚Äù

	‚ÄúYou got any smokes?‚Äù¬† I asked, cutting him off in my haste to quench my addiction.

	Taken slightly aback, the man unconsciously reached into his jacket pocket, ‚ÄúY-yeah I‚Äôve got some wintergreen dip, if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre after.‚Äù

	Only slightly disheartened by the lack of cigarettes I said, ‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got yourself a deal Mr‚Ä¶.‚Äù

	‚ÄúCall me Marcus,‚Äù Marcus said, handing me a can of Copenhagen Wintergreen.

	‚ÄúPleasure doing business with you Marcus, I‚Äôm Mick.‚Äù¬† I said cheerily.

	‚ÄúSo where are y‚Äôall from?‚Äù¬† I asked as I cooked healthy portions of bacon, eggs and a large stack of pancakes for everyone.¬†

	‚ÄúSavannah, we‚Äôre from Savannah, Georgia.‚Äù¬†¬†

	‚ÄúDo you mind if I ask how it is over there?¬† And what it‚Äôs like out there in general?‚Äù

	Hesitantly, Macus said, ‚ÄúWell I guess I could tell you our story, it‚Äôs the least I could do for the first hot meal we‚Äôve had in days.‚Äù

	‚ÄúEat your fill first, then you can tell me if you don‚Äôt mind.‚Äù¬† I said setting plates down in front of hungry faces.¬†¬†

	Marcus didn‚Äôt verbally respond but nodded his head as he chowed down on bacon.

	Cain, out of curiosity or boredom, decided to grace us with his presence wearing a komodo robe, fluffy bunny slippers, ‚ÄúJUICY‚Äù sweatpants that were absolutely drenched and a cane with a golden animal head as a handle.

	Marcus eyed the man suspiciously and his hand went tense on his thigh, the girls avoided looking at the admittedly strange man.¬† Cain, for the first time since I‚Äôd known him, read the room and sat a polite distance away and warmed his hands around a cup of coffee.

1mnvrt0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1mnvrt0/my_girlfriend_never_existed_and_i_still_miss_her/,My girlfriend never existed and I still miss her.,"I know how it sounds. I know I sound crazy. I'm not crazy. I'm not. 

About 2 years ago I was at a bar with my friends. I don't tend to go out and drink. I don't like clubs or raves or big events with loud music, I like people and socializing but generally in a more relaxed environment like a house party or something. However I was convinced to go out by one of my close friend Andrew. He was cheated on by his girlfriend about a week prior and he lived by the philosophy of ""to get over someone you must get under someone new"". I never understood that mentality but since he was there for my last break up I thought I'd be there for his. 

I spent most the night sipping on cheap whiskey I over payed for in the back watching my friend talk to this girl he's been trying to impress with his dance moves that seem to imitate the dance of a bird looking for a mate. Strangely enough it seemed to be working. I wasn't really looking to find a girl myself. After my last relationship ended I kinda swore of dating. Not really because it ended poorly, we are still friends vaguely, just too much to deal with emotionally at this point in my life. I felt like I needed to be by myself for a while longer to figure out who I am and what I truly want. Until that night when what I truly wanted accidentally bumped into me spilling her drink all over me. 

I looked up and I saw her. She was panicking and apologizing about spilling her gin and tonic all over me but I was just trying to catch my breathe after she stole it with her eyes. I mean this girl was gorgeous. Not supermodel statues or anything but just something about her. She felt like the girl next door you'd have a crush on in elementary school when you first started to discover that girls don't have cooties and if they did it was worth getting. 

I remember this night vividly like it happened yesterday. It was all so surreal. After the general apologizies that were shared, her for making my white button up with rose designs all over it soaked, and me for... Well I don't know what I apologized for I just felt like I should say sorry for breathing the same air as her. She finally asked me my name.

""Desmond""

""Hey Desmond my name's Mary"" 

We proceeded to talk all night. She was wonderful. She was a psychology major on her final year of her bachelor course planning on getting her PhD and minoring in philosophy. She loved hiking, dogs, smoking weed, kids cartoons. Her favorite thing to do she said was taking walks at night. She said it was just the perfect time to do so. ""Everyone's asleep so it feels like the world is yours and just yours"". She was funny in a witty pun way. We talked so long my friends dance moves finally got the girl he's been talking to all night. He came up to tell me he was leaving and he's give me a ride home if I wanted but I told him no thanks I'll just walk home I'm enjoying my time. 

Mary and I went on a walk that night until the sun came up. I swear I was already in love. We shared phone numbers and set up a coffee date in a couple days. 

Months went by and everything was going perfectly. Since I worked weekends and she went to school weekdays the only time we could hang out was at nights. We watched movies at the theater, went on walks, cooked dinner at my place. We never went over to her apartment, she said she lived in one of those 4 bdr with 4 random people places where everyone shares a common room and kitchen but pays for their individual room as rent. At nights they would throw parties that were filled with drunk college kids or they would be up late in the common room studying with each other so it was always my place we'd go to. She always had issues with her roommates so I wasn't ever gonna push to go over there cause frankly based on her stories I wouldnt like them much either.

After about a year of dating little over a year ago she randomly knocked on my door. She was supposed to be studying for her mid terms with her roommates so wasn't expecting her but I gladly let her in. She was crying something fierce. I quickly sat her down asked her what happened while making her, her favorite caramel tea we get at a local tea shop. She explained to me that her and her roommates got into a massive fight and she had to get out of there. She talked about she hated living with them but she couldnt afford to move out. I, without skipping a beat, asked her to move with me. My lease was ending and I was already looking at this 2 bedroom outside of town that isn't too far away from her college and my work. We talked about it all night until she finally agreed with me that she would. Her biggest fear was she didn't have much money to help with the lease which wasn't an issue to me seeing as I was planning on moving there with or without her.

After she moved in the first 3 months was amazing, everything went smoothly. She was happy I was happy, we were learning to live with each other and grow with each other. I knew I was gonna marry her. Until things started getting weird.

In the last 9 months looking back in hindsight there were dozens of instances that just felt off or out of nowhere. For example, she has met my parents which my mom loved her, but I never met hers. When I asked her about it, she started to tear up and explained to me that they died when she was in middle school. She was on a field trip in school and when she got back her parents weren't there to pick her up. After waiting a while she said a cop came up to her and told her that her parents died in a car wreck. Apparently on their way to pick her up a semi t boned them running a red and died on impact. She lived with her grandma until she was 17 and sadly her grandma go cancer and passed away right before her 18th birthday.

I felt it to be strange that after a year and a half she is just now telling me but I just assumed it was a touchy subject and left it there. 

Another strange thing I noticed is she didn't really have friends nor was interested in making them. I never heard any stories about them other than a classmate saying something funny or dumb in class. I tried to set up a double date with Andrew and Christy (the girl he met at the bar) but she usually had an excuse of being too tired from school or not the right time. It always felt like the only person she hung out with was me. 

In the last two months she started to become distant. It wouldn't be anything major, she just talk less, focus less on conversation. She didn't want to go on walks that much, she stayed late at school to study. She missed dinners more frequently, and most the time I wouldn't see her until I woke up in the morning and she was in bed next to me. I was planning on talking to her about this haze she was in but I was praying that it was something harmless like her finals just eating up her time or stress of graduating afterwards and seeking employment. Our relationship was pretty solid so I don't think it was her cheating on me or breaking up with me.

However I started to get worried the more and more she came late, or how much she slept in the day. She slowly stopped eating more than some fruits and snacks. I was worried she was getting sick so I begged her to see a doctor to get a check up. After a couple weeks of her saying she was fine but clearly wasn't she gave in and told me to make an appointment. That appointment was set for last week. August 1st. It was set for 930 am which doesn't seem early but for two night owls it was a rough wake up. I got up to the alarm and went to roll over to wake her up and she wasn't there. I figured she just didn't sleep well and woke up early so I got up got dressed and headed into the living room. No sign of her. I started to call out her name to be met with the silence of an empty apartment. I walked outside to see if she was out there or took our car somewhere and our car was still there. 

I started to freak a little. I went to call her but when I went to my phone her name wasn't in my contacts. It confused me because how could I accidentally delete a contact. I quickly dialed her number manually only to be met with ""this line has been disconnected or out of service"". I started to tear up. At this point I assumed she ran away or something. It was the only logical excuse I had but why go through the effort of deleting my contact in my phone just to disconnect hers? Why would she just leave? Nothing in our relationship was going badly and I thought after all we been through together I at the very minimum deserved a note or a conversation. Hell an email... Just something. My brain went full force, so I called Andrew. He picked up, still hungover from the night before. I could tell because he still was slightly slurring his speech.

""What's up bro bro, why you calling so early you know i was at a party last night?""

""Bro she left, disconnected her phone, deleted her contact in my phone. She left man she just left..""

""Who left?""

""MARY!? WHO ELSE?""

""Calm down man, first off who's Mary?""

""Are you fucking with me right now? This is not the time to mess with me!""

""Dead ass dude I don't know who Mary is. I'm not messing with you""

My heart sank on that sentence. I was so confused, my mind racing a million miles a second and none of it was making sense.

""What do you mean you don't know Mary? She's my girlfriend, the one I live with. The girl at the bar. We've been dating for two years.""

""Dude you haven't dated anyone since Jessica, are you okay? Did you take any drugs last night? Do I need to go over there?""

I just hung up the phone. I just couldn't in that moment. I needed to go look for her. The first place that came to mind was the college, I sped over there as fast as I could and ran into the lobby of the main building. 

""Hi can I help you with anything?""

""Uh, yeah"" I said in the calmest demeanor I could muster. ""I'm looking for my girlfriend I was seeing if she had any classes today or something.""

""What class would she be in and what's her name?""

""Mary Fulbright and uh.. I think the earliest class would be psychology with professor Jackson""

She started to clack on her keyboard for what felt like eternity. ""Well psychology class won't start until noon and professor Jackson won't be here until 10 but I don't see any 'Mary Fulbright's' on the attendance register.""

""What do you mean? She's on her masters right now, she's been going to this college for 5 years now. How could she not be on the registration?""

""I don't know Sir but I don't see her here. You can ask professor Jackson when he arrives if you want to go to his room. It's room 312 in building C""

I sprinted out there and found the building and the room. I sat there trying to slow my shaking down. I could barely breathe. A mixture of fear and confusion was raging through my body to the point where it was the only thing I could notice. I barely caught prof Jackson as he walked by me. 

I rushed to him ""hey I'm so sorry to bother you, the receptionist lady told me you'd be here soon. I was asking about my girlfriend wondering if you'd know anyone she takes your first class. Mary Fulbright?""

""Who?"" He responds caught off guard and confused. 

""Mary, she is getting her masters. You've been her teacher for two years?""

""I'm sorry I don't know a Mary, do you have a picture of her?""

I grabbed my phone and opened gallery, I started looking through the images and all of her pictures were gone. Any selfie she sent that I sceeenshotted just wasn't there. Then I noticed something strange... We went to a national Park last weekend, I requested the day off. We had a stranger take a picture of us in front of a statue at the hub (her idea). I have that picture but she wasn't in it. I was just standing there smiling by myself. I almost dropped my phone, at this point I was breaking. I looked up at the professor and apologized and excused myself before I was about to fall apart. I sprinted outside. My breath out of control. Nothing felt real. I scrolled through my entire phone and nothing. Any pictures we were in together it was just me, some I was even doing a weird hand placement like I was relaxing my arm on an invisible person. Nothing of just her. I called my mom in a panic just trying to get something to ground me. She's met her dozens of times she has to know. 

It rang. And rang. And rang. And finally ""hey sweetie what's up? You okay?""

""Hey mom, do you know Mary Fulbright?""

""No am I supposed to?""

""Oh.. uh okay thanks anyways I'll talk to you later. Love you."" I quickly hung up the phone.

I spent the last week looking for any evidence of her existing. It felt like my mind was fractured and nothing was real. Maybe Andrew was made up, maybe my job was made up. Maybe this is a like shutter Island and I'm in a mental hospital. I felt like I should be in one. Hell I was about to check myself in if it wasn't for me going back home and looking at a picture. All the pictures of her weren't there anymore like they never were there in the first place. Our lease only had my signature. All her school work and clothes aren't on the desk or closet anymore. I was defeated until I looked at my desk after sitting on the couch shell shocked like I just lived through d day. Trying to figure out why my memory of her was so vivid. So detailed. Until I saw a picture. She wasn't in it but it was a picture of me on the couch. She loved that picture of me. 

The thing was... She was the one who took it. If she didn't take it who did? It was the only evidence I had to show that she was real. That I wasn't crazy. I've been researching ever since. People's disappearances. People's stories. Seeing if there's any one with something like mine. That's why I'm writing this post. I found a couple of stories online, no connection to Mary but the people were saying the same thing. Their significant other disappearing out of the blue. Their fear of going insane. Some lost their minds. Others moved on. I found a small group still looking still believing. I have a ticket to Peru, that's where one of them (someone who is going through something similar) his name is Tom is at. He said that there's a lead of someone who might now what's going on. A shaman or something. I don't know, I don't care. I will find you Mary.

That's why I'm posting this on reddit... Mary if you are reading this by chance I know you exist. I'm looking for you. I'll find you I swear.

Any advice appreciated","Hi, I'm in California and work at a big green coffee company after a few years of unemployment in my field with mass layoffs that never recovered. So my first fear is that if I sue my employer for this, it'll come up on my background checks and I'll have an even worse time finding future work. 

  
Back in May I had a grand mal seizure at work very obviously caused by the action of my store manager. My 2nd one as an adult, where the last one years ago a gene test was done based on childhood history and we found out I have GEFS+....basically febrile (heat related) and sleep deprivation related seizures that are really hard to provoke as an adult (it seems there needs to be some excessive second thing). My boss kept scheduling me for back to back clopens (store closes at 7 and opens at 4am) and I spoke up politely a few times before this that I just couldn't handle that sleepless schedule. I got shrugged off and a few coworkers witnessed this and got more worried than me over how dismissive it was. I just figured I'd keep looking for another job. 

Then one opening shift/clopen in May I couldn't function at all I was so tired. I remember getting my allergies called out too and told to take a zyrtec. I did because food service, but otherwise wouldn't have since \*I\* know it's just allergies and allergy shots were in a few days (pushed back needlessly because my manager never recognizes needing that one day a month off to get that done, this was talked about in interview). I didn't know that that allergy med was a stimulant and that paired with no sleep = had my first grand mal seizure in years.

  
The ER basically pushed me out quickly to clear a bed and even my neurologist later was mad they did this because it was obvious they didn't do their job right. From what I can tell I guess they didn't report to the DMV either, but my neurologist did (teaching hospital, so probably impossible to avoid). ER said I ""fainted"" but paramedics, coworkers, and all customers that were witnesses said it was an obvious grand mal seizure and they ALL knew immediately what likely caused it.

  
Corporate denied worker's comp because ""this could happen to anyone"" and I'm now left with an $800+ ambulance bill for an ambulance call I didn't make, and a $3k bill for a representative to get my license reinstated (it was suspended as of yesterday, got the letter today, even though it's almost 3mos since the seizure). 

  
I've only found 1 lawyer willing to take the case and had a near identical case recently, but something seemed off, and a half dozen calls to worker's comp lawyers with paralegals who don't seem to understand what a seizure is....and then case gets denied. I'm not really sure what's normal or expected going about this kind of thing or what to look for that would be a sign someone would be a good lawyer to go with?

Is my employment screwed over this if I go this route (might not have a choice since I can now say this job has cost me more than it's made me total)?

Any advice on finding or screening for a good lawyer for this kind of thing?

Reese says her pancreatitis makes her feel for people who have serious ongoing health problems.   
  
Reese's Bible superchatter uses her monthly membership message to say that she and her prayer group have been praying for Reese since Wednesday in Jesus' name. ""That's hard core,"" Reese says. Another superchatter also prays for her in Jesus' name. Reese says she's a new believer and she's not sure about the proper etiquette for praying, but if someone asked her to pray for a friend now, she would do that.  
  
When a chatter tells Reese pancreatitis is very serious and not to take it lightly, she replies that she's not even sure what it is and she probably needs to read about it. ""All I know is it's incredibly painful,"" she says. Reese claims she's trying to be grateful about her life and that she doesn't have something more serious like cancer. She's been talking to God a lot, she says.  
  
Reese says she's surrounded by people on YouTube but she's also isolated. She wants to move where there's a community she can go out and be a part of, she says.   
  
A woman she was on Zoom calls with today and last week told Reese today that her face looks less puffy. Reese starts making faces and doing a monologue about whether it's noticeable that she's been eating mashed potatoes. She then goes off on how awkward it is for other people to comment on someone's body. It's safer to just tell people they look fantastic, she advises.   
  
She says she wants to move out of the country because Americans complain all the time. Reese clearly doesn't go back and watch her own streams or she would see how much time she spends complaining.   
  
Recently a guy was about to cut her off while they were walking and he looked at her and said ""Go!"" That made her not want to live here because she can't stand being around people who are in a hurry and rude, she says. That bothered her for a good 40 minutes, she says. Reese has found a new catchphrase she uses lately when talking about people she doesn't like. She says she hopes this guy gets a large tuft of pubic hair in his coffee and that it gets stuck in his throat. So classy.   
  
Reese has been sending herself even more recipes while she's been sick, she says. She plays a reel she found of a man telling people that they have one chance at life and not to waste it feeling held back by something mean or hurtful someone said.   
  
Hydrocodone is magical, she says, and she can see how someone can get addicted to it. She gets excited to take it at night, she says. Reese and one of her superchatters have taken to calling Reese's pancreas ""panky."" She says her doctor gave her 10-milligram pills and she's started to break the pills in half because she has to ration them and she's afraid to run out of them. I highly doubt that her doctor only prescribed her one pill a day. I think she's just messing with her audience.

She's joking about being an addict or becoming an addict. She's claiming she just learned in this stream that hydrocodone is an opioid and says she remembers Tommy talking about those. Hydrocodone makes her silly, she says. She claims she woke H up at 2 in the morning and was walking around asking ""Who is farting?"" because it smelled like shit in her house. He got her back to bed, she says.   
  
Her Bible superchatter spends $5 to send her a verse saying that the Lord looks at her heart, not outward appearances.   
  
Reese claims she's only taking 5 milligrams of hydrocodone a day now and that she only takes that dose before going to bed at night. There's no way severe pain could be numbed for 24 hours just doing that. Something is not adding up.   
  
She starts joking about who will let her fans know if she dies because she doesn't have any YouTube friends who will spread the word. ""The haters will tell everyone,"" she says. Reese keeps asking people to hit the subscribe button and says that she's not going to stay on much longer because she's tired.   
  
Near the end of the stream, her Bible superchatter spends another $10 for Reese to read a verse telling her to pursue righteousness and a godly life.   
  
Reese and her chat start joking about who would get her caftans, her horse sweaters and her pets if she dies. She says she'd want her elderly dog, Gertie, to be put down if she died because Gertie would be miserable without her. ""I don't know who wants Beau. You guys can fight over him,"" she says of her large dog who she's been talking about rehoming because of her plans to move.   
  
She picks up Gertie and asks the dog if she wants to go live with one of her fans if Reese dies or if she would mind dying because Reese died.   
  
Her Bible superchatter spends yet another $10 to send what she says is a better closing verse. ""May the Lord bless you and protect you,"" it says. Reese thanks that Bible superchatter for sending her a T-shirt and for all of her other gifts.  
  
No wonder Reese wants to move to a community where there's a church she likes. Maybe she thinks she'll find more Christians who will just throw money at her.",3,1754962009.0,OT42,2,0.81,False

So, you've a friend or friends in the cast. You're showing your support by watching. You're excited until.......

Pangit yung show. As in. Or okay naman siya, maganda nga, may mga elements lang na di mo nagustuhan.

I want to say:

a) valid ang feelings and kritisismo mo about sa napanuod mo, valid ang feedback mo. Spectators' comments are valid, whether or not bumili ka ng ticket or nabigyan ng compli ni friend actor;

b) if may negative comment ka whether sa whole show or part, heto ang aking unsolicited advice.......

When meeting your friend at the stage door after the show, do NOT in any way give them your critique. No matter how long na kayo friends. No matter na kilala mo siya na matibay as steel sikmura niya sa kritisismo. No matter if paghug ninyo tinanong niya, ""What did you think?""

Do NOT give negative feedback.

Say the parts that you liked, if any. Congratulate your friend. Give only honest, positive feedback. Then say ""Coffee tayo soon,"" ganon.

Here's why. Actors are a vulnerable bunch. Actors pour out their hearts on stage. Actors are constantly honing their craft. Pagod sila after a show. Hindi nila pa kakayanin or kailangan emotionally ang critique mo. Not after they bared their souls on stage.

Kasi ganito. Ang makakatanggap ng kritisismo mo right after a show is the Inner Child Artist nung actor friend mo. You'll do them damage if you give negative feedback.

After some time, perhaps a few days, when you meet for coffee or pizza, basta pag nakasettle down na si actor friend, he or she will have the courage to ask, ""So, what did you really think?"" Ayan, ibig sabihin si Inner Adult Craftsman na ni actor friend mo ang nagtatanong, yung side niya na hungry for feedback para ma-improve niya sarili niya sa kanyang craft.",28,1754961386.0,TeatroPH,2,0.87,False
