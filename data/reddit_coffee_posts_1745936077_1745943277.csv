1karnu0,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_-C_hro-N_i-C_les/comments/1karnu0/spiritual_awakening_5/,Spiritual Awakening #5,"Chapter 5 – Mount Shasta

Jaycee’s heart still thrummed with the residual energy of her profound communion with the Creator, a vibrant echo resonating within her soul days after the experience. 
 
Rolling over in bed, the soft morning light filtering through the curtains, she reached for her phone, the image of Mount Shasta, a majestic, snowcapped peak she’d never known existed, now firmly imprinted in her mind. A quick search fueled by an inexplicable pull, had revealed a mountain steeped in mystery and spiritual significance, and she hadn’t been able to shake the feeling that it held some vital key for her. 

A couple of days had passed since her awakening, filled with a quiet sense of anticipation and a growing certainty about her next step. She found herself sitting across from Abbi at their favorite local coffee shop, the familiar aroma of roasted beans and freshly baked pastries filling the air.  

Abbi, ever her pragmatic and grounded best friend, listened intently, a mixture of concern and amusement playing on her features as Jaycee recounted her recent experiences.  

“So, you’re telling me,”  

Abbi began, stirring her latte with a thoughtful frown, 

“that you basically had a conversation with… God? Like, the actual Creator of the universe?”  

Jaycee nodded, a serene smile gracing her lips.  

“It felt like it, Abbi. It was more than just a voice; it was a feeling of pure love and understanding, a connection to everything.”  

Abbi raised a skeptical eyebrow.  

“It was like being shown… everything. The interconnectedness of it all, the real purpose of suffering, the importance of love…”  

Abbi leaned back in her chair, her expression a mixture of worry and genuine affection.  

“Jaycee, honey, I love you, you know that. But this sounds… well, it sounds a little out there. Like, really out there.” 
 
“You felt it remember?” 

Jaycee questions. Abbi nods cautiously. 

“I felt something, I know that.” 

Abbi says softy. Jaycee chuckled. 

“I know, I know. Believe me, if anyone had told me this a week ago, I would have thought they were completely nuts. But it felt so real, Abbi. So incredibly real.”  

“Okay,”  

Abbi said slowly, taking a sip of her latte.  
“So, what does this… connection… have to do with Mount Shasta?”  

“That’s the crazy part,”  

Jaycee exclaimed, her eyes lighting up with excitement.
  
“After it happened, I just had this overwhelming feeling, this pull towards Mount Shasta. I’d never heard much about it before, but I looked it up, and you won’t believe what I found.”  

She leaned forward conspiratorially.  

“Apparently, it’s this massive, snow-capped volcano in Northern California, the second-highest peak in the Cascade Range. But that’s not even the interesting part.”  

Abbi waited patiently; her gaze fixed on Jaycee. 
 
“It’s considered a super sacred site,”  

Jaycee continued, her voice filled with awe.  

“Native American tribes have revered it for centuries; think it’s a portal to the spirit world. And get this – a ton of spiritual seekers believe it’s this huge energy vortex, a place where you can connect deeply with the Earth and the divine.”  

Abbi snorted softly.  

“An energy vortex? Like some kind of cosmic drain?”  

“Not exactly,”  

Jaycee laughed.  

“More like a place where the Earth’s energy is concentrated, making it easier to meditate, heal, and have spiritual awakenings. Some people even say it’s a chakra point of the Earth, connected to our root chakra, representing
 grounding and connection.”  
Abbi shook her head slowly.  

“Lemurians? Really, Jaycee?” 
 
“I know, it sounds wild!”
  
Jaycee admitted, a wide grin on her face.
  
“But there are these legends, Abbi, stories that have been around for over a century about these ancient beings called Lemurians who supposedly live inside the mountain. Some people believe it’s an entrance to this lost underground city called Telos, filled with these super evolved, peaceful beings who are trying to help humanity.”  

Abbi massaged her temples.  

“Do you hear yourself Jay?” 

Abbi muttered under her breath. 
 
“But that’s not all!”  

Jaycee pressed on, undeterred by Abbi’s skepticism. 

“People who go there talk about having these incredible spiritual experiences, visions, even encounters with beings from higher dimensions. Others just feel this deep sense of peace and healing energy. It’s supposed to be one of the most powerful spiritual vortexes on Earth, drawing people from all over the world.”  

Abbi sighed, taking another sip of her latte. 

 “So, let me get this straight. You had this… experience… and now you’re planning a trip to California based on legends of underground cities and Aliens living in the mountain?”  

“It’s more than just legends, Abbi,”  

Jaycee insisted, her voice filled with conviction.  

“It’s a calling. The Creator showed me Mount Shasta. I need to go there.” 
 
Abbi’s expression softened, her concern for her friend outweighing her skepticism.  

“Okay, I hear you. But what exactly is the plan?”  

Jaycee’s excitement bubbled to the surface as she outlined her itinerary.  

“Well, I was thinking of flying into Reno, it’s the closest major airport. Then I’ll rent a car and drive down to Lake Tahoe. Remember that time we went to Tahoe? I was thinking of going to Cave Rock. Apparently, it’s another powerful spiritual spot on the lake. I want to meditate there, kind of set my intention for the journey.”
  
Abbi nodded slowly, a flicker of a memory of their past trip crossing her face.  

“Then,”  

Jaycee continued, her voice gaining momentum,  

“I’ll probably camp in the National Forest around Tahoe for a night, just to connect with nature and get grounded. After that, it’s about a five-hour drive up to Mount Shasta.”  

Abbi’s eyes widened slightly.  

“You’re planning on camping alone?”
  
“I think so,”  

Jaycee replied, a determined glint in her eyes.  

“I need to be alone with my thoughts, with this feeling.”  

She pressed on with her plan.
  
“When I get to Mount Shasta, I’ll camp at the base of the mountain at this place called Panther Meadow Campground. It’s supposed to be really sacred, a place where the veil between dimensions is thin.”  

Abbi’s concern deepened.  

“Jaycee, you haven’t been camping in years. And alone? Isn’t that a little… risky?”  

“I’ll be careful,”  

Jaycee reassured her, though a tiny seed of doubt flickered within her. She pushed it away, focusing on the next steps.  

“The plan is to hike up the mountain. There’s a campground at about 10,400 feet (about 3.17 km) called Helen Lake Campground. I’ll hike up there and camp for another night.”  

“I promise I’ll be ok.”  

Jaycee said, reaching across the table to squeeze Abbi’s hand. Her resolve was firm, a deep inner knowing guiding her. The pull towards Mount Shasta was undeniable, a powerful force beckoning her towards an unknown destiny.  

Despite Abbi’s understandable skepticism, Jaycee knew in her heart that this journey was not just a whim; it was a necessary pilgrimage, a step she had to take on her path of awakening. The mountain was calling, and she had to answer.

1karng7,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes_t1/comments/1karng7/managing_with_only_longacting/,Managing with only long-acting?,"I was diagnosed in February 2024 (14 months ago) with T1d (LADA). 10.7 A1c, GAD65 and ZNT8 positive.

So far I have been managing my disease by just taking a 10-unit Lantus shot every morning, and eating around 40-80 carbs per day. The carbs I eat are exclusively high fiber & low glycemic (broccoli, cauliflour, blueberries, nuts, etc).

I am technically still in the ""honeymoon phase"" as my fasting C-Peptide is 0.81.

I am still wrestling with denial about the fact that i'm eventually going to need to transition to taking fast-acting insulin and wearing a CGM / pump.

I'm wondering if anyone here has been able to manage this disease beyond the honeymoon phase with just long-acting insulin + diet.

\----

More info:

The lantus + high fiber + low carb + honeymoon phase combination got my A1c down from 10.7 to 6.1 and then to 5.9.

When I got the 5.9 I got cocky and kind of went into denial about my disease and stopped taking the Lantus completely. Ate an egg mcmuffin, spiked to 215. Ate a giant burrito with rice a couple days later and spiked to 400. Definitely not doing that again....

But now that i'm back on the Lantus/high fiber/low carb diet, my BG is consistently around 115-165.

It will rarely drop to the 80s, or rise to the 180s. It will definitely go 200+ if i eat something like a bagel, tortilla, pizza, pasta ,or potato chips. But i don't really care too much about those things, so I just don't eat them.

\----

The common sentiment seems to be ""as a T1d you can eat whatever you want, just make sure you bolus for it.""

But constantly bolusing for high, or even medium carb meals seems like a tremendous hassle, and extremely risky to me. I would much rather just eat like a dog (consistent), and keep my insulin intake as low as possible.

I've seen so many TikToks from T1d creators that have made me dread the end of my honeymoon phase. I see people having constant struggles with pump occlusions & leaks, CGM sensors failing or being off, going low from taking too much fast-acting, or going high from not taking enough, being woken up nightly by CGM alarms and having to chug a juice box at 3AM to avoid dying in their sleep, etc etc etc. Then they post ""what I eat in a day as a type 1 diabetic"" vlogs and they're having a bagel with their breakfast, and eating pasta or having a roll with their dinner.

I'm definitely not judging ANY T1d's because as far as i'm concerned anyone who contends with this disease is fighting a battle so much worse than the general population will ever understand. It's just that I'm a newbie to this disease, and when I see Type 1s eating pasta, and then struggling with a low or high that night because they miscalculated their fast-acting insulin bolus, or they had a pump occlusion/leak or something... it just gives me hope that maybe I could avoid a lot of that struggle by just not eating the pasta & bagels.

Again I hope this doesn't come off as rude or judgmental. I'm just curious what I'm missing.

When I told my endo what i was doing, she looked mortified. Like she recoiled back with a shocked look on her face. She said ""NO no no no, you need carbs! you are masking your disease!"" She's right. I only had 1 positive anti-body at that point, and was very motivated to ""mask"" my disease because I was desperate for any ""evidence"" that could help me rationalize my denial about having Type 1. I wish I would have picked her brain more in the moment to figure out why she felt so strongly that I needed to eat more carbs, but I didn't.

\----

Is it mostly cholesterol & heart disease concerns that are motivating T1s to eat carbs? Because cutting carbs means replacing the calories with something else; and if we don't plan our low-carb diet meticulously we could end up eating way too much saturated fats and raising our LDL/triglycerides?

After seeing my endo's horrified reaction to my diet, that was the main thing that came up when I was looking into the low-carb strategy. so I've started avoiding fatty steaks, and cheese.

Again the diet i've settled on is basically broccoli, cauliflour, blueberries, strawberries, walnuts, almonds, cashews, peanut butter, steak, chicken, fish, avacado, almond milk, water, and coffee - and at least during my honeymoon it seems to be working ok.",1,1745942741.0,diabetes_t1,0,1.0,False
1karmsr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Mumbai_Relationships/comments/1karmsr/my_coworker_keeps_flirting_even_after_i_told_her/,My coworker keeps flirting even after I told her I’m not interested,"So, there’s this girl at my office who’s been clearly into me for a while now. It started out pretty subtle — joining me for lunch, small talk here and there — but it’s gotten more persistent over time.

Now she brings me chocolates, cold coffee, insists we leave the office together, and hangs around even when I try to keep things formal. She’s nice and all, but I’ve already told her politely that I’m not interested — I even mentioned that I’m more inclined toward Bengalis or Jains (I know preferences can be weird, but it’s how I feel).

She just smiled and said, “Just let me enjoy this time.” Like… what?

I’ve been trying to ignore the signs without being rude or making things awkward at work, but it’s getting a bit uncomfortable. I don’t want to come off as cold or arrogant, but I also don’t want to lead her on in any way.

Any advice on how to set clearer boundaries without creating unnecessary drama at work?

* **Zubababa Knight's** artwork is a reference to the pose the original **Zubaba Knight** had whenever it was summoned in the *ZEXAL* anime.
* Similarly, **Gagaga Ganbara Knight's** pose in its artwork is a reference the original **Ganbara Knight's** pose in the anime.
* **Gogogo Goblindbergh's** artwork is a reference to how the original **Goblindbergh's** effect was depicted in the *ZEXAL* anime and manga: as having the monster Special Summoned through its effect being held inside a containter before 
offloading it onto the field.
* **Dodododo Warrior's** pose is based on the original **Dododo Warrior's** summoning pose in the anime.
* **Hope ZEXAL** visually resembles Yuma Tsukumo himself and has elements of Yuma and Astral's **ZEXAL II** and **ZEXAL III** transformations in its design.

* **Gagagaga Girl's** effect of granting a second attack to an **Emperor of the Future - Hope** monster is a reference to the Trap Card **[Kattobing Challenge](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Hi-Five_the_Sky_(anime\))** from the *ZEXAL* anime, which Yuma used to allow 
his **Future Numbers 0: Emperor of the Future - Hope** to make a second attack.
* **Magnum Excalibur** is a reference to a scene from Yuma Tsukumo's fifth Duel against Shark in which he equips his **Heroic Champion - Excalibur** with **[The Strongest Shield](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Magnum_Shield_(anime\))** (""Magnum Shield"" in the English versions).

commonly used by Yuma) and to *Unbreakable Heart* (the first opening theme of *Yu-Gi-Oh! ZEXAL II*).

*****

##@Ignister

* **Linkslayer @Ignister** is a reference to how the original **Linkslayer** was used as Link Material for **Accesscode Talker** during Ai and Playmaker's final Duel in the *VRAINS* anime.

*****

##Altomegia (Medius storyline)

* **Medius** is Latin for ""middle"" or ""center.""
* **Altomegia** (*Arutomegia*) seems to be a mix of *alto* (Latin for ""high"" or ""upper""), **art**, and possibly a twist on *magia* (Latin for ""magic""), as well as being an overall nod to *academia*. It also possibly incorporates 
the Greek phrase *To Mega Therion* (""The Great Beast""), which was adopted by the famous occultist Aleister Crowley as his magical name.
* **Finemelt** might be named after **fine arts** and **color melting** (the blending or mixing of different colors, typically in the context of art or design).
* **Graphlare** is possibly a portmanteau of **graphic arts** (the visual arts based on the use of line and tone rather than three-dimensional work or the use of color) and **flare**.
* **Litera** comes from **literature**.
* **Diaktoros** (Ancient Greek for ""messenger"" or ""guide"") is a term often used in literature to describe someone who carries messages between gods and mortals—Hermes, for example, is famously called Diaktoros because he's the gods' messenger. His kanji 
subname of **Imprisoned Scholar of the Divine Arts** (*Shingeigokuto*) is read similarly as the other Altomegia monsters' **Scholar of the Divine Arts** moniker (*Shingeigakuto*).
* **Nerva** comes from **Minerva**—the Roman goddess of wisdom, strategic warfare, and the arts, revered as a virgin deity who embodies intellect, invention, and civic duty. She is symbolically linked to owls (representing wisdom, vigilance, and keen insight), with her 
Greek counterpart **Athena** known for usually being accompanied by an owl.
* **Academy Town of Divine Arts** (*Shingeigakuto*) in Japanese is read the same as the **Scholar of the Divine Arts** moniker shared by most of the **Altomegia** monsters as part of their kanji subnames.
* **Theorialize** seems to be a portmanteau of *theoria* (Latin and Ancient Greek for ""observation"" or ""theory"") and **realize**. **Forevision** (*Yogenshi*) in Japanese is a portmanteau of *yogen* (""prediction"" or ""prophecy"") and *genshi* (""vision"" or ""visual hallucination"").
* **Mécénat** (pronounced ""meh-say-nah"") is a French term meaning ""patronage,"" especially the support (financial or otherwise) given by a wealthy individual, corporation, or institution to the arts, culture, education, or science. 

*****

##Psycho

* **Psycho Girl of Stillness** is a combination of the names of the original **Psy Girl** (""Esper Girl"" in the TCG) and **Psycho Witch of Stillness** (""Serene Psychic Witch"" in the TCG).

*****

##Emperor

* **Eidos the Underworld Emperor** is an upgrade of the original **Eidos the Underworld Emperor's Squire**. **Eidos** (pronounced ""EYE-doss"" and Greek for ""form"") is a term referring to the **ideal form** in Platonism. The **Emperor** (*Teiō*) in its 
Japanese name is written with the two kanji used for the **Emperor** Magic/Trap Cards, as opposed to the single kanji used for the other **Emperor** monsters.
* **Tessera** is likely named after **quintessence**—in classical and medieval philosophy, a fifth substance in addition to the four elements, thought to compose the heavenly bodies and to be latent in all things, which is 
similar to the ether **Aither the Heavenly Emperor** is based on (seeing as this monster resembles **Idea the Heavenly Emperor's Squire**). **Primordial Emperor's Squire** (*Genteijūki*) is a reference to the 
names of the Trap Monsters **The Emperor of First Beginnings** (""The First Monarch"" in the TCG) and **The Emperor of True Beginnings** (""The Prime Monarch"" in the TCG), both of which share the kanji *gen* (""beginnings"" or ""origin"") in their Japanese names.
* Each of **Culmination's** effects is based on the on-summon effects of the original six **Emperors**.

*****

##Flame Swordsman

* **Black Flare Swordsman** is a reference to **The Knight of Black Flames -Black Flare Knight-** (""Dark Flare Knight"" in the TCG).

*****

##Tistina

* **Crystallizing Miasma** (*Kesshō*) is a play on the Japanese term for **crystallization** (also pronounced *kesshō*), with the second kanji instead having been replaced for the one meaning ""miasma.""

*****

##Vanquish Soul

* **Rocks** is named after **Rock of the Vanquisher**.
* The artwork of **Start for Vanquish Soul!** is likely based on the character selection screen in *Street Fighter II* (a 1991 fighting game developed and published by Capcom for arcades), depicted with a world map in the background.

*****

##Super-Quantum

* **Zetan** is named as a parallel to **Super-Quantum Fairy - Alphan**, being named after the Greek letter **zeta** (and referring to **Z**, the last letter of the Latin alphabet).
* **Layer 19** is worded in the fashion of a typical *Super Sentai* episode title. (It is also the nineteenth **Super Quantum** card released.)

*****

##Morganite

* **Morgana** (a play on **Morganite**) is a reference to **Morgana le Fay**—a complex and shifting figure in Arthurian legend, typically portrayed as a powerful enchantress or sorceress with deep ties to King Arthur and the mystical realm. The **Witch of Eyes** 
moniker is a reference to how the term **Morganite** has the kanji subname **Demon's Pupil** in these cards' Japanese names (the kanji for ""pupil"" and ""eye"" being the same).

******

##Nouvellez

* **Angry Burger** is named similarly as its original counterpart, **Hungry Burger**. **Angry** (*Anguri*) is also a pun on the Japanese word meaning ""open-mouthed"" (also pronounced *anguri*).
* **Recettes de Nouvellez** is French for ""Nouvellez Recipes.""

*****

##Moonlight

* **Moonlight Liger Dancer**
 * Summon chant: ""O king of beasts who dances at the pinnacle of the moonlit wilderness! O wild beasts who dance beneath the moonlight! Drawn into a spiral by the moon's pull, be reborn with a newfound power! Fusion Summon! Show yourself, the king among kings, the one whose dance rules over the moonlit night sky! Moonlight Liger Dancer!""

*****

##Primordial Stone

* **Berzelius** is named after Jöns Jacob Berzelius, a Swedish chemist and the namesake of **berzelianite**—a rare silver selenide mineral (Ag₂Se) known for forming soft, metallic-looking crystals. **Nether** sounds 
similar to the **Another** in **Another Beryl, the Primordial Stone Dragon's** name, which is seemingly this monster's original form.

*****

##ARG☆Stars

* **Arion** was a mythical, immortal horse from Greek mythology, known for his incredible speed and intelligence and belonging to Adrastus, the king of Argos. **Courageous Steed** (*Yūshun*) is a pun on the Japanese phrase 
for a ""fine horse"" (also pronounced *yūshun* but with the first kanji swapped out for the one meaning ""courage"").

*****

##Sento

* The ""**=**"" sign in **Zero's** name is meant to be a combination of the hyphens used in the names of **Sento Princess - Rei** and **Sento Princess - Roze**.
* **Lemnisgate** is a portmanteau of **lemniscate** (a figure-eight or infinity-shaped curve, often used to represent a mathematical or geometric symbol for the concept of infinity) and **gate**. The sword technique 
shown in the artwork is called a **flat thrust**, where the sword is held horizontally, and then thrust forward to impale the enemy. This stance is widely known for being used by Hajime Saito in the manga *Rurouni Kenshin*, specifically as part of his *Gatotsu* technique.

*****

##Regenesis

* **Pentateuch** refers to the first five books of the Hebrew Bible (Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). Traditionally ascribed to Moses, it is now held by scholars to be a compilation from 
texts of the 9th to 5th centuries BC. **The Law of World's Renewal** (*Saiseiritsu*) is a play on *saisei* (""regeneration"" or ""renewal"") and *seiritsu* (""coming into existence"" but with the last kanji instead being the one meaning ""law"").
* **Commandments** refers to the **Ten Commandments** or the **Decalogue**—religious and ethical directives, structured as a covenant document, that, according to the Hebrew Bible, were given by YHWH to Moses.

*****

##Miscellaneous

* **The Black-Clad Magic Tribe - Leo Wizard** is a reference to the depiction of the original **Leo Wizard** in the Game Boy Color video game *Yu-Gi-Oh! Duel Monsters 4: Battle of Great Duelists*, with this card's artwork 
having been inspired by **Leo Wizard's** in-game illustration. Its effect of requiring a release to summon monsters with more than 1350 ATK is a reference to how those kinds of monsters were all high-level in *DM4*, and it having an advantage over 
LIGHT monsters in battle is a reference to how the **Black Magic** alignment had a similar advantage over the **White Magic** one in the early *Duel Monsters* games.
* **WAKE CUP** is a pun on **wake up**, while **mocha** is a type of fine-quality coffee (or any imitation of it, usually flavored with chocolate).
* **The Ancestral Dragon King** is named after its original counterpart, **Wyrm the Ancestor Dragon** (""First of the Dragons"" in the TCG).
* **Sacramentum** is a Latin term for an oath, a solemn vow, or a sacred obligation—originally used for military oaths of loyalty, and later tied to religious rites in Christianity (such as baptism and communion). It serves as a 
parallel to **Dragon Crown of Mysterion** (""Mysterion the Dragon Crown"" in the TCG), with **mysterion** being a term in Christian theology referring to the sacred acts or events that could not be fully understood but were revealed through faith, such as Christ's death and resurrection.
* **THE Starham** is a pun on **star** and **hamster**, with the two syllables in the latter having switched places.

* **Vallon** is the family name of the character Porthos from *The Three Musketeers*, a French historical adventure novel written by French author Alexandre Dumas. **Hypertelekinetic** (*Chōnen*) seems to be a pun on the fact the 
Japanese words for ""super""/""hyper"" and ""bird"" are homophones (both pronounced *chō*), making its name sound similar to **Castel the Avian Musketeer** (""Castel the Avian Skyblaster"" in the TCG).
* **Zilophthonia** is the Greek word for ""jealousy"" or ""envy,"" while a **gorgon** is a term for a female creature in Greek mythology with snakes for hair and who has the power to turn anyone who looks at it to 
stone. **Self-Autonomous Magneto-Destruction Machine** (*Jiritsukikai*) is a pun on the Japanese term for ""autonomous machine"" (also pronounced ""jiritsukikai"" but with the first and last kanji swapped out for the ones meaning ""magnetic"" and ""destruction,"" respectively).
* **Ukanomitsune-no-Onari** is a similar naming scheme as **Ukanomitsune-no-Tamayura**. *Onari* is an honorific term referring to the outing of a member of the imperial family or a noble, while also being a play on **Inari** (the Shinto deity associated with foxes).
* **Return of the Duelist** is also the name of a previously released OCG/TCG core set (whose cover card is **Heroic Champion - Excalibur**). The artwork depicts a scene from the **RETURN OF THE DUELIST** commercial.
* **The Swamp of Sudden Thunder** is a reference to the **Swampman Paradox**, a thought experiment imagining a scenario where a lightning bolt strikes a swamp, creating a perfect physical duplicate of a person named Donald Davidson, known as the Swampman. This raises 
philosophical questions about identity, consciousness, and whether the Swampman possesses intentional states or experiences, despite being a mere physical replica without a history or experiences.
* In the artwork of **Spring**, the phrase *Haru wa ake bono* (""Spring is the dawn"") is shown. This is the opening line of the classical Japanese work *Ise Monogatari*, symbolizing the season's fresh, new beginning.
* **Trapholic** is a mix of **Trap** with the suffix **-holic** (derived from ""alcoholic"" and used as slang to refer to any sort of obsession or addiction).
* **Spirit Hunter** is named after **Giese the Spirit Hunter**, the title of a *Yu-Gi-Oh! GX* episode in which Johann Andersen Duels the titular Giese Hunt. The artwork depicts a scene from that episode in which Giese uses 
his **[Hunting Net](https://yugipedia.com/wiki/Hunting_Net)** to ensnare Johann's **Gemstone Beast Amethyst Cat**. This card's effects are also a reference to Giese's general playing style, which involved ensnaring his opponent's monsters into his own Magic & Trap Zones.

🔥 **""Why Rest Makes You STRONGER (The Productivity Lie Exposed)""**🔥

🚨 **The Rest Revolution: Why Your Grind Mindset Is Failing You**

Michelle was a hustle culture poster child - working 80-hour weeks, proud of her exhaustion. Until her body crashed. What she discovered next changed everything:

**The Neuroscience of Strategic Rest:**  
• 90-minute work cycles + breaks optimize cognitive performance (Ultradian Rhythm science)  
• ""Diffuse thinking"" during rest sparks 73% more creative insights (Stanford study)  
• Chronic sleep deprivation costs $411B annually in lost productivity (RAND Corporation)

**5 Rest Myths Debunked:**  
1️⃣ ""I'll lose momentum"" → Actually regains focus  
2️⃣ ""Only weak people rest"" → Top athletes prioritize recovery  
3️⃣ ""I don't have time"" → 5-minute microbreaks work  
4️⃣ ""Rest is unproductive"" → Consolidates learning  
5️⃣ ""I'll fall behind"" → Prevents burnout setbacks

**Your Rest Toolkit:**  
🛌 **Deep Recovery:**

* 7-9 hours sleep (non-negotiable)
* Weekly digital detox (even 2 hours helps)

⚡ **Energy Boosters:**

* 20-minute ""coffee naps"" (game-changer)
* Walking meetings (2x more creative than sitting)

🧠 **Mental Resets:**

* 4-7-8 breathing (calms nervous system)
* ""Nothing breaks"" (stare out window guilt-free)

**Michelle's Transformation:**  
After adopting strategic rest:  
• 2X more productive in half the time  
• Landed her biggest client during a hike  
• Chronic headaches disappeared  
• Rediscovered joy in work

**Why This Works:**  
Your brain has two modes:

1. Focused work (goal-oriented)
2. Diffuse thinking (background processing) BOTH are essential for peak performance.

**The CEO Secret:**  
Bill Gates takes ""Think Weeks"" twice yearly. Arianna Huffington built a company around sleep science. Jeff Bezos prioritizes 8 hours nightly.

**Your Action Plan:**

1. **Track** your energy peaks/troughs for 3 days
2. **Schedule** breaks BEFORE exhaustion hits
3. **Experiment** with different rest types (movement, meditation, naps)
4. **Protect** rest time like important meetings

⚠️ **Warning Signs You Need More Rest:**  
• Cynicism about work  
• Decision fatigue  
• Relying on caffeine/crash cycles  
• Sunday night dread

**The Ultimate Irony:**  
The more you value rest, the less you need. By honoring your limits, you expand them.

I'm 29 and from Brazil. I’m a serious and goal-driven guy, but I’m also someone who laughs easily and loves meaningful conversations. I might be a bit clumsy with words sometimes, but I always speak from the heart.

I really value honest, close connectionswhen I bond with someone, I’m very loyal and committed. I’m hoping to meet a woman who shares that same mindset and is ready to build something real and lasting.

I’m a nerd by nature. I love tech, science fiction, space, time travel, and all those “what if” kind of topics. Shows like *Dark Matter*, *Star Trek*, *The Expanse*, *Stargate*, Silo, *Farscape*, and *Foundation* really spark my imagination. I used to game and watch anime a lot, and those interests still stick with me.

I live a pretty simple life. I work freelance, I study, and I’m always trying to grow and improve. I enjoy science and tech videos and music that really moves the soul. I’m a romantic too when there’s mutual energy and respect, I care deeply.

Lifestyle-wise: I don’t drink, smoke, or do drugs. I like calm vibes, fruit juice, and tea (coffee lovers feel free to keep it all to yourselves ). I’m not religious, but I respect all beliefs. I lean a bit conservative on some views and really value emotional presence, loyalty, and consistency in relationships.

I'm very talkative when I’m comfortable and can dive into deep topics for hours. But I’m also a great listenerif you enjoy real conversation, we’ll probably get along great.

As for the future, I’m working toward possibly starting my own company. Personally, I hope to find a monogamous partner to build a loving, peaceful life with. Maybe a family one day, a cozy home in the city and some peace in the countryside too. And of course, traveling together would be amazing.

I’m not here for anything casual. I’m really looking for something meaningful. If you're someone who’s emotionally available, loyal, and also looking to grow with someone long-term, I’d be happy to hear from you.

I think voice or video chats really help create a real connection, and I’m totally open to that once we get to know each other. Same goes for sharing photos if we’re both comfortable.

1karlge,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeMakerReviews/comments/1karlge/does_the_coffee_bear_cold_brew_coffee_maker/,Does the Coffee Bear Cold Brew Coffee Maker Deliver the Perfect Brew Review?,"**A Smooth Brew Every Time**  
The COFFEE BEAR 6793-2001 Cold Brew Coffee Maker has been in my kitchen for weeks now, and I have to say, my mornings feel a little brighter and less rushed. I tested this cold brew coffee maker daily, experimenting with various coffee blends and grind sizes. The result? A consistently smooth, low-acid coffee concentrate that tastes like a love letter to coffee aficionados. The borosilicate glass carafe not only looks sleek on the kitchen counter but also feels durable and easy to handle during those groggy early hours. This infusion pitcher does more than just sit pretty—it’s built to deliver rich, flavorful beverages without fuss.  

**Smooth and Low-Acidity Brewing: A Game-Changer**  
This coffee maker produces a cold brew concentrate that's not only delicious but also noticeably less acidic than traditional brewing methods. After steeping my coarse-ground coffee for about 20 hours, the lower acidity truly hit home, providing a smooth, rich flavor profile that doesn’t overpower. As someone with sensitive stomach issues, I appreciated sipping without that dreaded acidic bite. The 1.3L capacity is larger than most competing models, letting me brew enough to last several days. A winning feature is the flavor-sealing lid, which does a great job of keeping the coffee fresh in the fridge for up to two weeks.  

**Practicality Meets Style in Its Design**  
Aesthetically, it’s a polished piece of equipment. The clear borosilicate glass and black food-grade silicone details blend well with any modern kitchen. The anti-spill spout made pouring ridiculously easy, thanks to its precision design. No more wiping down countertops after every pour. I also appreciated the removable, non-slip base that added stability to prevent accidental tipping—essential for someone like me who’s usually half-awake while brewing.  

[Check COFFEE BEAR 6793-2001 price on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/p/b01ly8pzfr/)  

**Versatility That Suits Every Beverage Lover**  
One of the best surprises with this coffee maker was its multi-purpose mesh filter. Beyond brewing cold coffee, I’ve used it to make loose-leaf iced tea and fruit-infused water. The rust-free mesh is sturdy, and the ultra-fine weave ensures that no loose bits sneak into your drink—which is a huge relief. Whether transforming cinnamon-flavored tea leaves into a refreshing summer drink or infusing orange slices and mint into water, this product handles it beautifully.  

**Advantages**  
- Sleek, borosilicate glass design with a modern aesthetic.  
- Larger brewing capacity (1.3L) compared to most.  
- Versatile filter for coffee, tea, or fruit-infused beverages.  

**A Few Negatives**  
While the COFFEE BEAR excels in many ways, there are minor trade-offs, which I feel obligated to share.  
- The lid, although effective, could feel more snug for complete assurance against leaks.  
- Washing by hand, while an option, will occasionally mean dregs stuck in hard-to-reach spots within the mesh filter.  

**Other Options: Competing Products Considered**  
Over my years of testing, I’ve used similar cold brew makers like the Takeya Deluxe and Ovalware RJ3, and here's where the COFFEE BEAR stands out. Unlike the Takeya, the COFFEE BEAR comes with a glass finish, offering a more high-end look and feel. While both models brew a comparably smooth coffee, the Takeya’s smaller capacity is a limitation for heavier coffee drinkers like myself. The Ovalware RJ3 impresses with its ergonomic design, but COFFEE BEAR’s anti-spill features and additional versatility with tea and fruit-infusion edges it out.  

**Cost Efficiency in Everyday Use**  
Budget-wise, this cold brew coffee maker sits at a sweet spot given its features. I’ve seen pricier models offer less brewing capacity and versatility. It’s one of those items where you feel like you’re genuinely getting ""true value"" for your money. The reusable mesh filter also saves costs in the long term by bypassing disposable filter purchases. Cold brew from your kitchen invariably ends up cheaper than cafe prices—so my wallet and caffeine cravings are both satisfied.

# Best Whole House Water Filter Systems of 2025: Reviews & Comparisons

Are you tired of questionable water quality affecting your home? Do you worry about contaminants lurking in your tap water, impacting everything from your morning coffee to your showers? If so, you're not alone. As we move into 2025, the demand for effective and reliable **house water filter systems** is higher than ever. This comprehensive guide will explore the best whole house water filter options available, helping you make an informed decision to protect your family and your home. We'll cover everything from removing sediment and chlorine to tackling more complex issues like iron and PFAS, ensuring you have access to safe, clean water throughout your entire house.

## Why choose a Whole House Water filtration System?

Unlike point-of-use filters that only treat water at a single faucet, a **whole home water filtration** system, also known as a **point of entry water filter**, treats all the water entering your home. This means every tap, shower, and appliance receives filtered water. Here’s why that’s beneficial:

   **Comprehensive Protection:** A whole house system removes contaminants from all water sources, protecting your family from harmful substances whether they are drinking, bathing, or washing dishes.
   **Appliance longevity:** Filtered water reduces scale buildup in appliances like water heaters, washing machines, and dishwashers, extending their lifespan and improving their efficiency.
   **Improved Taste and Odor:** Say goodbye to unpleasant tastes and odors caused by chlorine, sulfur, or other contaminants. Enjoy cleaner, better-tasting water straight from the tap.
   **Healthier Skin and Hair:** Filtered water is gentler on skin and hair, reducing dryness and irritation caused by chlorine and other chemicals.
   **Potentially Lower Costs Over Time:** While the initial investment may seem higher, a **cost effective water filtration** system for the whole house can save money in the long run by reducing appliance repairs, soap usage, and the need for bottled water.

## Understanding Your Water Quality: The First Step

before diving into specific systems, it’s crucial to understand your water quality. Start with **water testing** to identify the specific **water contaminants** present in your water supply. The type of contaminants, along with your household's water usage, will determine the best **water purification system whole house** to choose.

   **City Water:** If you're on a municipal water supply, your water is likely treated with chlorine or **chloramine removal** to disinfect it. While these disinfectants are effective, they can also impart an unpleasant taste and odor. You should also check for **lead removal** due to aging pipes as well as **PFAS removal**. City water test reports are often available online.
   **Well Water:** If you have **well water**, regular testing is essential as it's more susceptible to contamination from bacteria, nitrates, agricultural runoff, and other sources. Common issues include high levels of iron, manganese, and sediment. **Water filter system for well water** is frequently enough more robust to account for these naturally occurring contaminants.
   **Water Hardness:** Also consider the **water hardness** level, which is the amount of dissolved minerals like calcium and magnesium. Hard water can cause scale buildup, reduce the effectiveness of soaps and detergents, and leave spots on dishes and fixtures.

## Types of Whole House Water Filter Systems

Once you know what you need to filter, you can explore the various types of **house water filter systems**:

*   **Sediment Filters:** These are typically the first line of defense, removing particulate matter like sand, silt, and rust. A **whole house sediment filter** protects other filters and your plumbing system from clogging.*   **Carbon Filters:** A **carbon filter system** effectively removes chlorine, chloramine, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other chemicals that cause taste and odor problems. There are two main types:
    *   *granular Activated Carbon (GAC): Effective for removing a wide range of contaminants.
       *Carbon Block:* Offers finer filtration and better contaminant removal than GAC filters.
   **Iron Filters:** Specialized filters designed to remove iron and manganese, which can cause staining and unpleasant tastes. An **iron filter whole house** protects your pipes and fixtures.
   **Water Softeners:** While not technically filters, water softeners remove calcium and magnesium ions that cause hard water, preventing scale buildup and improving the effectiveness of soaps and detergents. Consider a **water softener option** if you are concerned about sodium content in your water.
*   **Reverse Osmosis (RO) Systems:** An **reverse osmosis system** uses a semi-permeable membrane to remove a wide range of contaminants, including dissolved solids, heavy metals, and even some bacteria and viruses. RO systems are highly effective but can have a lower **water flow rate** and require a drain line. A **reverse osmosis whole house system** is a serious investment for the ultimate puriifed water.*   **ultraviolet (UV) Water Filters:** An **ultraviolet water filter** uses UV light to kill bacteria, viruses, and other microorganisms. **UV water purification** is an effective way to disinfect water without chemicals.

## Key Features to Consider When Choosing a System

When selecting a **best whole house water filter system**, consider the following factors:

   **Filter Life and Replacement:** Check the filter life expectancy and the **filter replacement** schedule. Longer-lasting filters reduce maintainance and cost.
   **Flow Rate:** Ensure the system has a sufficient **water flow rate** to meet your household's needs. A low flow rate can result in reduced water pressure.

1karic6,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1karic6/feeling_overwhelmed_i_tried_this_ancient/,Feeling Overwhelmed? 🌬️ I Tried This Ancient Breathing Technique for 7 Days to Reset My Nervous System & Control Cortisol: (Backed by Science) Achieve Calm Focus in Minutes 🧠,"Hey MaximizeMe fam! 🌟

Ever felt like your brain’s under siege by a thousand tiny troops of stress? 🤯 I recently hit my overwhelming limit, and I needed a solution pronto. That's when I stumbled upon an **ancient breathing technique** touted to reset the nervous system and control cortisol levels. And hey, it’s *backed by science*! Intrigued? So was I.

Here’s my week-long experiment with this stress-busting breathwork:

**Day 1:** Skeptic Mode 🔍  
Alright, confession time—I was kinda doubtful. Breathing? Really? But what the heck, right? I tried the *4-7-8 breathing technique*. In case you've never heard of it: inhale for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale for 8, and repeat. Felt a little... weird the first time. But that's normal for new things, huh?

**Day 3:** Something's Changing 🤔  
Was it the breathing or just placebo? I noticed my usual morning panic over emails diminished. Could holding my breath help me hold my peace? Still too soon to tell, but I felt a twinge of hope.

- **Key hack:** During those random work stress spikes, I closed my eyes and did the 4-7-8. A mini-vacation for my mind.

**Day 5:** Finding Zen 🧘‍♀️  
By now, I was looking forward to my breathing sessions, like meeting an old friend for coffee. My thinking was clearer, and I actually started finishing tasks instead of procrastinating like it’s an Olympic sport. Bonus: slept like a baby. 💤

**Day 7:** The Calm Before the Monday Storm 🌪️  
Yes, Mondays are always chaos, but I felt... prepared? More focused, less frantic. Felt like I had recalibrated my internal settings—my cortisol was subtly subdued, or at least chilling in the background a bit more.

- **Why this might work:** Apparently, slowing our breathing tells our brain we’re safe—dialing down that fight-or-flight frenzy.

So, was this ancient technique a game-changer for me? You bet. It was like finding a superpower hidden in plain sight—my breath. Breathing isn’t just *breathing* anymore; it's a tool, a weapon against the overwhelm.

Really curious to hear if anyone else has tried this kind of thing before and how it went for you. Maybe you've tried other methods that worked well, too? We all have our own little tricks, right? 🙌

just was thinking deeply about what exactly is making it difficult to brush teeth regularly and i realized its directly tied to executive dysfunction, and ""Rules"" that have been drilled into our heads from childhood. 

you cant brush your teeth if you are about to eat. so that means, not in the morning, cause you need breakfast. 

you cant brush your teeth for an hour or 2 after eating, cause your enamel is weakened. So you wait. 

But then, its time for lunch? So you cant brush your teeth before eating lunch. 

And same before dinner. 

So the only time i find to brush my teeth that doesnt contradict all the rules, is before bed. 

  
My dentist told me flat out. QUIT WORRYING ABOUT THE RULES

brush your teeth. she told me the only exception is 3 specific drinks. coffee, tea, and citrus juice

First, ayoko ko talaga ‘cuz I know maraming nalubog sa utang dito and knowing myself, maluho ako at impulsive tho never ako umutang. I worked hard naman to be fully-independent and make sure I can afford all my expenses.

But recently, grabe ang mga realizations ko especially when it comes to finances. I’m at point na I think I need this for emergency purpose and to save money na din thru cashback and points.

Since wala nga akong alam but I have had check a bit naman. Pero syempre I want to hear from you guys na may experience na talaga. 

Since this ka a Double-up Rewards Promo, I opted to BPI Rewards Card (Blue) and BPI Amore Cashback Card (Teal)

Why Amore:
- for Utilities kasi ako na rin nagbabayad ng bills namin and I want to use one CC lang for all these para di hassle. Medyo malaki din kasi bills namin
- I buy meds for my parents for their maintenance + personal care items na din
- for groceries then cuz I don bimonthly grocery to restock items sa bahay from time to time
- mainly sa bahay talaga and family matters


Why BPI Rewards
- I think I will need this for personal use lang talaga like mga luho e.g. shopping, travel (frequent traveler here), dining (coffee shops maybe cuz I’m WFA din)
- challenge here is I don’t how the points work pa
- flexible payments if ever I purchase medj mabigat na items
- travel insurance, yes I need it

for both, ofc to track all my expenditures kahit maliit pa yan. Cuz I wanna streamline na din using cash talaga, I noticed kasi pag cash ang bilis mawala sa akin. Siguro ayoko lang talga humawak ng pera so let’s do it digital. Also, like I mentioned, in times that  I need extra, this will probably help since installments options are available na.

Also if you ask why BPI? Payroll account turned saving account kasi to and ayoko magopen ng others bank accounts pa.

Tho dko pa talaga naactivate kasi wala pa sa akin ang physical cards but please let me know what are your thoughts pls. Your POVs are welcome, I wanna hear anything. Tama ba to, or wag ko iactivate.  Have encountered challenges, panghihinayang using these? Best practices and all? Please comment anything. Thanks!

I don't smoke or do drugs, very rarely drink. I got no pricings but I'm tattooed!
I'm also very animal friendly I used to have a dog for a long time and currently got my little cat Huby! (Yes I can share pictures for sure haha)
I am very into psychology and mental health since I recently started investing in my own and now I have a much better understanding of that topic. It is so unbelievably important.
I live a pretty stable life when it comes to work and a place to live. I have my own house with garden but it's so much room and so much work for me all alone. This house needs some life with a loving girl next to me maybe some kids and maybe a family dog haha! Also I'm not dead set on this house. I wouldn't mind selling and relocating someplace nice. Just so you know lol. I'd like to have a girl that understands and cares for me, someone I can be a mountain to hold onto for, somebody I can share my passion and love with. I love spending time together doesn't matter what! Cooking together or grocerie shopping, showering or working in the garden, watching movies or playing video games together all of it is great. I don't mind sharing pictures or face timing at all whenever you feel comfortable with that! To be a bit confident I can say that I don't look all to bad I just haven't gotten any luck yet lol. That might change today tho!
I really hate talking about myself this much and the amount of ""I"" or ""I'm"" I said is actually upsetting me lmao 😭

So hey if you are still reading and are actually interested in learning more about me then feel free to send me a message! I don't really mind your age so 18-35 sound fine by me! I answer as soon as I see it. I got some free time at the moment haha! I'm looking forward to getting to know you! And if I'm not your cup of tea maybe I am a coffee lol 😉🤔

1karca8,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Sleeping_Beauty_777/comments/1karca8/how_to_touch_a_woman_without_being_a_fuckwit/,How to Touch a Woman Without Being a Fuckwit,"(Presence Is the New Foreplay So Wake the Fuck Up)

First of all, sex isn’t a fucking conquest.

It’s an act of devotion.

And most men are still stuck at page one.

Women talk about sex differently than men.

It’s not a myth. It’s not some Cosmo fantasy.

It’s real and it’s humbling if you ever actually fucking listen.

They talk about orgasms the way men talk about football injuries, 

… what worked, what didn’t, how long it took,

 … how sometimes they just faked it to get it over with because the fuckwit thought he was auditioning for PornHub’s Greatest Hits instead of actually paying attention to her fucking body.

The problem is that most men were taught how to fuck, not how to feel.

That’s why most women leave emotionally long before they leave physically.

Meanwhile, most guys are out here still trying to navigate sex with a roadmap written by drunk cavemen.

Jackhammering like it’s an Olympic event, wondering why she looks like she’s mentally reorganising the pantry instead of moaning.

Porn taught him that jackhammering equals passion.

Locker room wisdom taught him that asking questions equals weakness.

And ego taught him that if a woman doesn’t come, it’s her fault for being “complicated.”. 

Look, here’s the uncomfortable truth:

You don’t deserve her body if you can’t hold her heart.

Full stop.

Most men have no fucking idea what they’re doing when it comes to women’s bodies.

And worse  they don’t know how much they don’t know, because no one ever told them that it’s okay to ask.

You think good sex is about being harder, faster, stronger?

It’s not.

It’s about being present

Porn taught you how to finish.
But it didn’t teach you how to connect

You were taught to perform.

To conquer.

Not to feel.

Female sexuality isn’t a Rubik’s Cube you have to solve.

It’s a universe you’re supposed to show the fuck up for.

Good dick is easy. 

Actual, real, soul-level presence. That’s rare.

Meanwhile, woman are  over there swapping notes like secret agents.

“Did he touch you like this?”

“Did he even bother asking what you liked?”

“Did you have to fake it, or was it actually good?”

“Did you make a connection?”

It’s a fucking conference over coffee.

Meanwhile, most men are somewhere between “Did she come?” 

and “I think so?   … Maybe? 

Fuck it, close enough.”

But here’s the thing about female sexuality that every man should tattoo into his brain:

If all you bring is your dick,
don’t be surprised when all she feels is emptiness.

She’s  not a fucking vending machine.

You don’t push the right button and get the orgasm you ordered.

It’s a conversation.

A surrender.

A trust

It’s her nervous system, her body, her heart , all deciding if they feel safe enough to let go.

And if you’re too busy trying to win at sex, she’s too busy trying to survive it.

Your Dick Isn’t the Gift. Your Presence Is.

Female pleasure isn’t about technique.

It’s about presence.

It’s about actually being there.

Not just your dick.

Not just your ego.

You.

Without presence, sex isn’t intimacy.
It’s just two strangers using each other to forget how lonely they are.

So maybe you could ask her what she likes.

Ask her how she feels.

Ask her what she’s scared to tell you.

And then, fucking listen.

Not with your dick.

With your whole fucking soul.

Touch her like you give a fuck about the answer.

Feel her , not just physically, but emotionally, energetically, deeply.

Because, If you don’t know how to ask a woman what she likes,
you’re not ready to touch her at all

Because a woman’s pleasure is not some fucking scavenger hunt you complete by luck.

It’s the reward for being awake.

It’s what happens when she feels safe enough to stop surviving you,  and actually surrender to herself.

Women don’t want a Pornhub performance.

They want presence.

And most men are still too scared to give it.

But trust me, If she trusts you enough to open,

you’ll find that she isn’t complicated at all.

She’s an entire fucking universe waiting to be explored.

But only if you have the courage to slow the fuck down, get curious, and stop making her pleasure about your fucking performance review.

You want better sex?

Then just stop trying to perform and start trying to connect.

Stop trying to win.

Start trying to feel.

Real sex starts when your ego shuts the fuck up and your soul finally shows up.

And maybe , just maybe ,  you’ll finally understand the part they don’t teach you at Porn Hub;

Sex isn’t about trying to “make her come.”

You’re trying to create a space where she feels safe enough to become.

It’s about making her trust you enough to let go, 

not just come and go

If you don’t get that, you’re still playing at love, not living it.

You’re not fucking her.

You’re just rehearsing your loneliness inside her.

The best sex of your life isn’t about getting harder, lasting longer, or “dominating” shit you don’t even understand.

It’s about waking the fuck up.

About dropping the script.

About touching a woman like she’s a living, breathing miracle , 

not a trophy, not a test, not a porn highlight reel.

A fucking miracle.

And if you do that ,  if you really show up, 

you’ll realise something that every woman already knows:

Sex is easy.

Connection is rare.

Presence is everything.

If you can’t be present with her,
it doesn’t matter how good you are at fucking,
you’re still leaving her alone in the dark.

So go re-learn everything you thought you knew.

And for fuck’s sake, 

ask her what she likes.

You might just find she’s been waiting to tell you all along.

I’m a 29-year-old guy from Brazil who’s serious about life goals but doesn’t take himself too seriously all the time. I’m the kind of person who laughs easily, speaks from the heart (even if I get a bit clumsy with words), and really values honest, meaningful conversations.

I’m here hoping to meet a woman who’s emotionally mature and ready to build something real something steady, warm, and long-term. I deeply value emotional presence, loyalty, and mutual support. If you’re someone who’s all in for growing together, I’d love to get to know you.

A bit about me:

* Passionate about tech, sci-fi, space, and time travel. Stories like *Dark Matter*, *The Expanse*, Silo, *Stargate*, *Star Trek*, and *Foundation* fuel my imagination.
* Former gamer and anime fan, still love those worlds.
* I freelance, study, and live simply focusing on personal growth over material things.
* Big fan of fruit juices and tea (no coffee for me!), and I prefer calm vibes over wild nights out.
* I’m a talker and a great listener if you enjoy deep or nerdy convos, we’ll click.
* I wear glasses, have a darker skin tone, and my English is about 50/50 but I do my best!

I’m romantic by nature and dream of building a quiet, love-filled life maybe one day with a family, a home in the city and another in the countryside, and peaceful nights talking or stargazing. I’m also working toward creating something of my own professionally maybe even my own business.

I really believe voice or video calls are important for truly connecting, and I’m open to photo exchange if you’re comfortable. Not looking for anything casual I’m only interested in genuine, monogamous connection.

**What I connect best with:** calm energy, honesty, loyalty, consistency, and someone who’s emotionally available and curious about the world.

**Not a match for me:** smoking, heavy drinking, cheating, emotional detachment, or open relationships.

If you’re between 24 and 38, and any of this resonates with you, I’d be happy to chat and see where things go.",0,1745941990.0,ForeverAloneDating,1,0.5,False

1karblo,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1karblo,leaking basket + newbie questions [Breville Bambino Plus],"I took advantage of the current Breville sale and finally purchased a Bambino Plus (via Amazon)! Unfortunately, I'm getting coffee leaking down the side of the portafilter. I contacted for an exchange and they offered me $80 instead. After confirming that I can still return it in the event I am unable to fix the problem, I went ahead with that option - I figure at best it's a free accessory and at worst I break even.

Some things I've tried:

* Cranking the portafilter tighter past the lock position.
* Switching baskets. This seemed promising at first; the 1-cup single wall seemed to not leak compared to the 2-cup single wall. However, I've confirmed it does indeed leak, just not nearly as badly.
* Took off the showerhead and gasket to look for defects (2nd pic). Cleaned and reinstalled.

So some questions now as to how to best approach this as well as generic newbie questions I've gathered along the way.

1. What would you recommend purchasing first? I'm thinking maybe a new gasket (b/c cheap) + a portafilter?
2. When inspecting the grouphead, I noticed some little cuts/scratches/notches in the black plastic. There are six of them and they seem to be centered in each of the three cutouts and each of the three flanges (that the portafilter keys into). See first picture. Are these normal? It doesn't seem like that would cause leaking but idk.
3. The coffee grounds should definitely NOT touch the shower screen, right? I noticed that it was super difficult to tighten the portafilter with 11g (in the single cup). I took the puck screen out and it was much better, but even then I saw a faint indentation of the shower screen and center screw head (third pic). Do I just need deeper baskets for puck screens?

I couldn’t focus because the fumes made me feel sick. I ended up not getting the job, and I was kind of relieved, because it meant I wouldn’t have to smell coffee every day.

Ive known him for two years and the whole time he’s been pretty stable and a good teacher. Irrelevant but probably my favorite teacher Ive had in all of highschool. And we’re honestly pretty close, there’s only 2 other people in the classroom and last year when I had him there was only one other as its the upperclassmen class and there arent many in the program and because he doesn’t have anything to teach us we just talk about life during the class period. We both have a similar sense of humor so we get along pretty and he’s really understanding of personal situations. He’s really open about things that are going on in his life and around a month ago said that the veterans association discontinued his PTSD medication because of new regulations from the government and was referencing a moment where he kind of lost his cool during his personal life.

 I didnt think much of it but did ask him how he was planning on coping with his symptoms because he was saying they were actually coming up a bit in his life and if he was going to see a psychiatrist or anything to get put back on medication. He seemed to be unsure of how he was going to proceed and said he wasn’t really planning on seeing anyone and just feeling it out. Probably a week or two after that conversation i noticed a slight change in his behavior he was more withdrawn and seemed to be invested in other things and at the same time would be complaining a disproportionately to his normal reactions about things going on in his life. I assumed it’s just the end of the school years responsibilities getting to him or whatever and never really thought anything of it or was concerned at all until yesterday. 

Another kid in my class who normally sits in the student office came in with a iced coffee drink and my teacher knows the kid and he also has a really sarcastic “dark” sense of humor so he called him the f slur for him. I was taken a bit aback but I thought it was funny at first but then he kept saying it repeatedly and it was like ok thats odd. I was like be careful you could get fired (while laughing) and he was like yea you’re right and he’s not hateful or anything but it wasnt completely in character and made me a little confused but i brushed it off because it still did seem like something he would do. But then later that hour he was complaining about taking care of his kids which is something he has NEVER done he always talks abour how great and easy his kids are so i found that odd. I asked if it was because his mother in law was in the hospital and his wife was with her on Friday and he started going off and being kind of passive aggressive. Saying things like yea shes good for now and that he wouldn’t care if she was dead. Which is SUPER uncharacteristic of him. I still didnt think too much of it i just thought wow i guess hes kind of eccentric today. But then two hours later my friend said when he was in his class which is a similar situation with barely any people this fully white man said the n word. And apparently he didnt seem like he even meant to say it and it’s so strange to hear because he’s not racist at all and has always been understanding whenever ive spoken about my own race struggles. He immediately took it back and looked confused on why it even came out according to my friend. 

I already had his class today and he didnt do anything similar but we were talking about politics so any heatedness i noticed was pretty normal and he isnt one who really loses his calm to begin with. He was really respectful on what i was saying and was acting completely normal. So I dont know if I should say anything because it could just be a one off situation and he was just feeling particularly stressed. I dont want to say something and seem weird for noticing anything or make him second guess his every action. I also really dont want him to lose his job or something because of having a similar outburst in front of the wrong students but Im also afraid im just overreacting and theres nothing to acknowledge. How would you feel if a student asked you about something like this? Is it a bad idea? I know a bunch of people will probably say to tell another teacher but I dont want to out him to his colleagues when I dont even know if theres actually a problem.

Bingo Squares: Gods and Pantheons (Quechal); A Book in Parts; Down with the System

**Two Serpents Rise (2SR**) is one of the books I've  changed my mind on. It used to be one of my favorites of The Craft Sequence, then I talked with folks that didn't like it as much and about why. At that point, I had to reread it and found I agreed with them. Now I think it's the weakest of the series, but has the best setting (Dresediel Lex). 3 stars ★★★

***Not for Bingo***. I've read this one far too many times for it to count.

**2SR** starts with a card game and helps establish this isn't your usual fantasy setting because a goddess is all in on it. Then we meet Caleb Altemoc, gambler and risk manager at Red King Consolidated (RKC). We also meet his friend Teo. Shortly after that, things go to hell at Bright Mirror Reservoir when something gets in there and kills a security guard. Caleb is on call when it happens and has to straighten matters out. There he meets a cliff runner (think Parkour with subculture elements) that *might* be part of what just happened. From there a long pursuit begins.

It's a fairly fun and well written book, but for a portion of it, it’s a Manic Pixie Dream Girl chase as Caleb tries to find the cliff runner (Mal) without involving the local police (Wardens) or his employer. Which makes things complicated. This is the portion I could have done without. Maybe both of them acting like adults would have helped.

There's also a business merger. The beginnings of a relationship. A disaster that takes them out of Dresediel Lex. Ball games. A major festival. Plus, a lot of musings on Craft and capitalism versus life under applied theology, open sacrifice vs. hidden sacrifice and which is worse.

This leads to Down With the System and some spoilers, because Mal is out to overthrow the system. And she's got ***plans***. 

Caleb as he is in **2SR** is not someone I like, mainly because he reminds me of my younger self. He's stupid smart, as in very intelligent but makes some of the stupidest decisions a person can make. Caleb does have *moments* particularly when he’s playing cards, an occasional priest to an occasional goddess. He's grown by the end of the book, but the process to get there is occasionally excruciating to read.

Temoc is *special*. Last Eagle Knight and Priest of all Gods. He's also a terrorist and a rebel. Plus, he's stealthy enough to put Batman to shame. His shirt tears like Doc Savage's as well. Despite all this, he's frequently hilarious (old freedom fighters home). He's also Caleb's dad and they have a complicated relationship - one that I'd have liked to see more of. 

Teo is a gem. She's Caleb’s true friend, gives him good advice, keeps talking to him and drags him out to be social. I'd have loved to see her as a viewpoint character or just more of her.

Then there’s the King in Red, aka Kopil. Veteran of the God Wars, slayer of Gods who broke many of them on their own altars and has never really gotten over the sacrifice of the love of his life. Also, undead, whimsical and major coffee fiend. I don’t always like Kopil when we encounter him - he’s a billionaire in a world where souls are currency. And I’m worried he might be right in his positions. He also needs to work on his mental and emotional health - he gets away with a lot, being a billionaire ruler of a major city state, that’s also a god killer.

Finally, there's Mal. She's the Manic Pixie Dream Girl of the book, or at least to Caleb. Caleb never gives her real agency. And as she’s written, she doesn’t. She's a goal, a target, not a person until late in the book. And even then, he thinks she's as shallow as he is. But reading and listening to the book  many times, she comes across differently - she's thinking there and working to her plan. Bluntly, she plants a lot of Chekhov's guns and then systematically takes them down and shoots them all. She also cares about Caleb which makes it so much more complicated for her. I'd love to have seen this book from her point of view.

Dresediel Lex, the city is its own character. Ancient and huge, it makes me think of L.A., Mexico City, Vegas and, in retrospect, Albuquerque. LA and Vegas are easy, LA on the coast, Vegas for the gambling, both for the thirst for water on industrial scales. El DF (Mexico City) is also thirsty, but also for the age, culture and vibe away from the coast and Albuquerque due to the industry and agriculture. I like Dresediel Lex because it feels *alive* and complicated compared to Alt Coulumb. There’s this vibe when the city is described - the people and the feel of it. There's flight everywhere from airbuses, to opterans, to skyspires. It has it’s downside as well - there are slums and discrimination. It will also drain you dry. Every turn of the faucet costs some soul. People mortgage their souls and risk becoming zombies to live there. Yet I still love it.

Look, this is the weakest of the series because of Caleb as he is in this book. Also because Gladstone tries to write noir and falls short with it. But it also gives us Temoc and Dresediel Lex and we'll see both of those again in the Craft Sequence and the Craft Wars. So three stars. ★★★",3,1745941151.0,Fantasy,1,1.0,False
1kaqzi9,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1kaqzi9/the_kingrinder_p2_is_a_great_little_cheap_grinder/,"The Kingrinder P2 is a great little cheap grinder, but it seems to have one important flaw","**TL;DR:** It's a solid budget grinder and it's serving me well enough, but some time ago I noticed it had developed a little ""play"" in its settings, which made the click wheel and burr shift forward and backward by almost 1 full click. So, in my P2, its precision is now essentially +/- 1 entire click, which is a dealbreaker for dialing in espresso. After checking it thoroughly, I'm pretty sure I've pinpointed the issue (detailed below), and I believe it's something that will affect all P2s over time, especially if you grind light-roasted coffee.

I've been using the Kingrinder P2 for a while now, and for the price, it's honestly a great little grinder. It's compact, easy to use, and gives a pretty consistent grind for espresso. If you're just getting into espresso and don't want to drop a ton of cash, the P2 is a solid choice. But, there is a pretty significant flaw I've noticed after using it for a few months.

[Photo of the click wheel with arrows pointing to the wear or deformation described ](https://preview.redd.it/rucpx1nymsxe1.jpg?width=5847&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d347836f6141904a0e9ff7f630637f0fb46aff94)

**The major flaw:** 

If you take a look at the photo of the click wheel, you can see that it's been ""bitten"" into at the corners by the grinder's central shaft. (You can even see some of the material ""mounding up"" as it has been displaced.) This likely happened while grinding stubborn lighter beans, as they're tougher to grind. When the burr jams, the resistance transfers to the click wheel, which is the only thing securing the shaft. Applying more force therefore causes the shaft to ""bite"" into the wheel.

In my opinion, this is the P2s major design flaw, as relying on the wheel alone just isn't enough: it has less surface, less material, a weaker structure, and it's taking most, if not all of the stress during grinding. I think this design would be more durable if the burr had a square hole (like the one the click wheel has) to grip the shaft directly.

That said, the damage doesn't seem to be getting worse since I found it. I've switched to only darker roasts for now, as I prefer them, tbh, but also to avoid pushing it further, since the P2 is all I've got for now. Because of the ""play"", I've started setting it one click finer than I want; this way, when it shifts, it doesn't go coarser than intended. It fluctuates between ""just right"" and slightly finer, which I've found to be the better compromise.

Overall, I don't think this is an isolated issue. I'm sure most people, will find this is also happening to them. Hold onto the handle firmly and try twisting the setting a bit, back and forth, without applying too much force; you'll likely see it shift quite a bit without actually clicking one way or the other, and in fact without the butterfly nut actually shifting in relation to the click wheel. That last is the telltale sign that the entire ""bundle"" is rotating slightly on the shaft. (If you don't see this happening, I'd love to know if you only grind darker-roasted coffees to try and prove or disprove my suspicion.)

It's a great grinder for the price, but I suspect it won't last long under heavy use.",2,1745941114.0,espresso,2,1.0,False
1kaqywt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1kaqywt/should_you_consider_the_nespresso_citiz_en167b/,Should you consider the Nespresso CitiZ EN167B Espresso Machine? A detailed review,"Experiencing the craftsmanship of the Nespresso EN167B CitiZ Espresso Machine has been an absolute delight. As someone who enjoys preparing quick and flavorful coffee in the morning, I found myself gravitating toward this compact yet feature-rich machine. The first look at its sleek, black design impressed me—it seamlessly fits into my kitchen's aesthetic without dominating the countertop. This machine, a product of De’Longhi, combines elegance with efficiency, hitting the sweet spot for coffee aficionados like myself who appreciate a balance of style and practicality.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Nespresso EN167B CitiZ boasts a minimalist design with sharp, iconic lines and a shiny black finish. It feels both premium and sturdy, yet lightweight enough to relocate easily if needed. I particularly enjoyed the folding cup shelf that accommodates both espresso cups and taller travel tumblers. It’s thoughtful little details like this that make the user experience so much better. However, I did notice the plastic exterior might not appeal to everyone, especially when compared to machines with stainless steel finishes. Still, for its price range, it aligns well with expectations.

**Performance Features**  
Every morning, this machine transforms my kitchen into a mini coffee shop. The 19-bar high-pressure pump consistently produces authentic, barista-style espresso. Whether I’m craving a smooth lungo or a bold shot of espresso, I found the results rich in flavor and aromatic perfection. The power efficiency left me impressed, too. It heats up in just 25 seconds, and the automatic power-off button after 9 minutes of inactivity helps in reducing energy usage—not to mention my coffee-making time is cut dramatically short when I’m rushing out the door.

**Adjustable Programming**  
I loved that the coffee maker offers adjustable cup settings, which felt incredibly intuitive. You can program buttons for two different cup sizes—Espresso (1.35 oz.) and Lungo (5 oz.). The precision ensures that every cup is brewed exactly to your preference, which is an asset I highly value. Additionally, I tested its compatibility with various pod capsules, including a few alternative brands, and found no issues. Certainly a win for those aiming to save money using third-party pods occasionally.

[Ready for Nespresso EN167B CitiZ Espresso Machine? See the Amazon deal.](https://idealcoffeeshop.com/price/b01mfc73az/)

**Ease of Use and Maintenance**  
Operating this espresso machine was unbelievably simple. A few button presses, a quick capsule insertion, and I had fresh coffee ready to go. Regular maintenance also felt hassle-free; the used capsule container holds up to 10 capsules, so you don’t have to clean it out too frequently. Scaling the machine and cleaning the removable water tank can be done within minutes. That said, the lack of a low water-level indicator proved occasionally inconvenient, as there were moments I accidentally tried to brew with too little water. 

**Strengths**  
- Compact, polished design suitable for small kitchens  
- Rapid heat-up time at 25 seconds  
- Rich, café-quality espresso using a powerful 19-bar pump  
- Simple operation with programmable settings  
- Energy-saving automatic shut-off feature  

**Areas of Concern**  
- Exterior build uses a plastic material that might feel less premium  
- Absence of low-water-level indicator  
- The coffee temperature could benefit from being slightly warmer  

**Peer Products**  
During my initial search, I considered options like the Breville Bambino Plus and the Keurig K-Café. While the Bambino Plus excels at allowing more manual control in preparing coffee, it lacks the compact silhouette of this CitiZ model. Keurig’s offering, though versatile with its broader beverage spectrum, doesn’t achieve the same crema quality and takes up significantly more counter space. Nespresso’s CitiZ comes off as a middle ground—combining efficiency, compactness, and high-quality coffee without unnecessary complexity. The CitiZ also thrives in capsule variety thanks to Nespresso’s lineup of flavor options, an area where rivals sometimes lag behind.

**Cost Efficiency**  
From my perspective, this product strikes a decent balance between quality and affordability. If you think in terms of eliminating frequent coffee shop runs, it becomes a practical financial choice over time. That first sip each morning feels like money well spent—considering the espresso quality it produces. Without breaking the bank, I’m able to enjoy a deluxe coffee experience every day. Functional, energy-efficient, and aesthetically pleasing, this product warrants attention from buyers who prioritize reliability.

1kaqwna,https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1kaqwna/150_hours_update/,150 Hours Update,"At the start of this process, the progress reports from others on youtube and reddit were what convinced me to start and keep with DS. Thank you to everyone who previously shared your progress. Hopefully this report can help someone out there.

This is a sample size one. Everyone is on their own journey.

**Why Bother / Backstory**

My wife is second generation with a Mexican father and half-Puerto Rican mother. Father's family all primarily speak Spanish. It's important to my wife that our children be English/Spanish bilingual. I was willing to learn Spanish in the past, but couldn't find a method that worked for me.

I grew up in Arizona and was regularly surrounded by Spanish. My experience in (American) school was that foreign language learning was pointless and ineffective - no one ever seemed to finish with any competency. I haven't previously formally studied Spanish, except for tinkering away at Duolingo for awhile (maybe 12 months) with no significant progress. Yo como manzanas en mi maleta.

As I go further, I am coming to appreciate Spanish culture, history, geography more and more. It's becoming something I want to do for its own sake as time goes on. DS is selling me on the Spanish-speaking countries of the world. They also taught me how a toilet works, which is cool.

**Method**

I have the premium DS subscription which I find to be a tremendous value. I joined at the start of the year. I have consumed content for approximately over one hour each day. I sit and watch DS videos in the morning with my coffee.

I removed Pablo as a guide (I like Pablo but I don't want a Spain accent and his speaking style is hard for me to understand - I might add him back in later). I organize by easy and proceed generally in order. I find that the amount of videos at the current development of DS is just about right to slowly step me up in difficulty.

I find the focused watching to be essential, at least at my level. If I am at all distracted, the time seems a complete waste.

I started using Anki for approximately a month or two but I have quit as I found that if I put words in Anki that I haven't heard enough times in DS they don't stick, and if I put words in Anki that I have heard enough times in DS there is no point. I don't think Anki works (for me). It's just a waste of time that could be spent on input. The trick seems to be just hearing the word enough times in actual use (not flashcard repetitions).

To clarify with Anki, I think you can 'memorize' the words in the sense of regurgitating them on cue if you put enough energy into it, but they don't ever seem to get memorized in the same effortless, permanent way as with input. YMMV.

I'm not a 100 % purist. As I watch, I use google translate on words that are completely new if I can't guess them from the context. Then I rewatch the relevant section without any translation. The 'translation' is useful solely because it puts me in the neighborhood of the actual word I'm hearing. The real meaning of the word is not the translation. These lookups are helping for now, but I am trying to minimize them more and more as I go on.

I also use Spanish subtitles on the videos when the word stream turns into mush for me. I will rewatch those sections over and over until I can pick out the words by ear, and then rewatch without subtitles.

I rewatch sections of videos with new/challenging content to up my understanding. If a section of a video is a blur, or uses a clever phrase, I might need to listen to it several times.

I have spent a little unrecorded time listening to Cuentame and reading very easy readers, but this I have put away for now. Better to wait.

**Results**

I'm at approximately DS level 40. My understanding ranges from 70-95%. 150 hours, travel time 4 months. I feel I am at or slightly ahead of the roadmap for level 3. I feel like I am picking up more verbs now (rather than just concrete nouns and the core verbs) - e.g. picar, placticar, seguir, poner, echar, meter, entrar, adivinar, agregar, agarrar, etc.

Native content is not possible with any significant level of comprehension (I would say 10%-20%). Peppa Pig is a stretch, or was the last time I checked (especially because of the rapid speech and high pitch kids' voices).

I have never had this kind of success before. If I'm being fair, I have made strong progress. But there are many days where I feel frustrated and disappointed with myself when I hit another wall, another video using some kind of new conjugation or unknown vocabulary. If you're constantly stepping up difficulty, you are going to keep feeling this way even if you are making good progress.

The beginning has been a total grind. One hour a day is hard at this level, mentally tiring. Some of the videos are not fun. But I try to give all the DS videos a shake because I can tell they are trying to target different types of vocabulary and grammar.

My prior experience with bodybuilding/gym has been very helpful in this context. Having the discipline to stick with something where you are seeing slow, incremental daily or weekly progress, where sometimes/somedays you hate the work has been critical.

The key has been to develop faith that the system is going to work over the long term. The long-term progress reports have been essential in keeping me going. Thanks to everyone who took the time to share your journey.

This really is like eating an elephant. Sometimes I will try to binge for a day, speedrun, but then I realize that there is no simply no way to hurry through this process. Even if I logged an eight hour day, I would not be significantly closer to the finish line given the overall distance. The only thing that is going to work is a sustainable routine over time. You eat the elephant one bite at a time.

1kaquwc,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_theonlineforyou/comments/1kaquwc/effortlessly_run_python_code_online_the_best/,Effortlessly Run Python Code Online: The Best Platforms for Developers,"In today’s fast-paced world of programming, the ability to run Python code directly from your browser without the need for complex setups is a game-changer. Whether you're a beginner just starting with Python or an experienced developer looking for quick testing, online Python interpreters provide an easy and efficient solution. These platforms not only save time but also allow developers to experiment with code on the go. Here’s why you should consider using an online platform to run Python code.

# Convenience and Accessibility

One of the most significant advantages of using an online Python platform is the level of convenience it offers. Gone are the days when you had to install Python and set up complicated environments on your local machine. All you need is a browser, and you can start coding immediately. These platforms are accessible from any device with an internet connection, whether you're on your laptop, tablet, or smartphone. This means you can write, test, and debug your code anywhere, at any time. Whether you’re at home, in a coffee shop, or even while commuting, you can continue your work without being restricted by software installations or system limitations.

# No Setup Required

Setting up Python on your local machine often involves downloading various tools, setting up dependencies, and managing environment variables. For beginners, this process can be overwhelming and time-consuming. Online platforms eliminate this hassle entirely. Since everything is preconfigured on the platform, you don’t need to worry about installation or configuration issues. With just a few clicks, you can start writing and running Python code, making the experience much smoother and more user-friendly.

# Instant Results

Another benefit of online platforms is the speed at which you can get results. Traditional Python development environments require you to save, run, and often wait for your code to execute. With an online platform, you simply press a button and see the output immediately in the same window. This instant feedback is particularly valuable for developers who want to quickly iterate on their code or test small snippets of logic without dealing with the overhead of opening a full IDE or managing files on their local system.

# Collaboration and Sharing

Many online platforms allow developers to easily share their code with others. This is ideal for collaborative projects, code reviews, or sharing solutions with peers or communities. Some platforms even offer the option to embed your code in a website or send a link to others, making collaboration more streamlined. This feature is especially useful for educational purposes, as instructors can share problems, solutions, and examples quickly with students.

# Resource Efficiency

Running Python code online also saves significant resources on your local machine. Without the need for complex installations and dependency management, you free up system resources, which means your computer can focus on other tasks. Moreover, these online platforms often run on powerful cloud servers that can handle much larger computations than your average laptop or desktop computer. This makes them an ideal choice for developers working with computationally expensive processes like machine learning or data analysis.

# Ideal for Learning and Practice

For learners, online platforms offer a simple, no-frills environment to practice coding. Whether you’re just getting started or trying to solve coding challenges, these platforms provide a perfect place to hone your skills. Many platforms come with built-in features like code auto-completion and error highlighting, which makes debugging easier and helps speed up the learning process. Additionally, with the ability to experiment with different versions of Python, you can get a better understanding of how the language evolves.

# Conclusion

In conclusion, using an online platform to run Python code offers several advantages, including ease of use, instant results, resource efficiency, and enhanced collaboration. Whether you’re a student learning the ropes or a professional testing snippets of code on the fly, these platforms provide a simple, efficient, and hassle-free way to code. So, if you’re looking to streamline your Python development process and boost productivity, giving an online Python platform a try could be just what you need.",1,1745940797.0,u_theonlineforyou,0,1.0,False
1kaqu86,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anglicanism/comments/1kaqu86/what_does_your_daily_devotional_routine_look_like/,What does your daily devotional routine look like?,"I love hearing the ways in which other people carry out their daily devotions! It's both interesting and insightful. This is what the week looks like for me:

*N.B. I use a mix of the 1662 BCP (with some assistance from the Common Worship Lectionary), my NRSVA Bible, and the New Daylight book by the Bible Reading Fellowship.*

**Monday to Friday:**

I always start the day with Morning Prayer, including my own prayers or conversations with God towards the end. I find the morning to be the best time to be vulnerable with God, free of the distractions of the day. I always pray the appointed Psalm(s) and try to reflect whilst doing so how I'm feeling or what is on my mind. Later on, towards the end, I'll speak from my heart and try to bring everything together and pray for God's guidance for that day.

I typically keep a diary of what I've prayed to God about and what guidance I have asked for.

For the lessons of the day I tend to follow what is appointed in the Common Worship Lectionary just because I find this structure a lot easier to follow when taking into context Sunday services.

During my work lunch break I spend five minutes or so going over the daily Bible reading in the BRF's New Daylight series. It feels like a breather really, especially during stressful days. It's nice just to step back, have a few minutes with the Bible. I might say a prayer once I've finished.

Once work has finished I'll have some downtime and begin Evening Prayer. With the appointed Psalm(s) I again try to pray them the best I can. Or should I say the most natural way I can? I tend to focus my evening prayers on looking back on the day. In the same diary mentioned earlier I note things down throughout the day like something/someone I want to pray for, something I achieved, something I was grateful for etc. This tends to focus my prayer. I'll also use this time to pray for situations that are ongoing like the health problems of a loved one, wars around the world etc.

**Saturday:**

I always manage to do morning prayer on a Saturday, but quite often forget to do evening prayer as it's usually Saturday evening I'm out doing something and my mind has gone astray. I do amuse myself though because whenever I get home I'll find myself laying in bed and speaking to God. It's much more of a yap I must say, but sometimes I feel like that's needed!

*Lord, in your mercy, hear my yap.*

**Sunday:**

It's safe to say we probably all have a very similar Sunday for the most part. My church offers a primary morning service (either Holy Communion, some form of an interactive morning worship, or a family service) and later on, Choral Evensong (my absolute favourite). After Church I tend to go for a coffee and some cake and study the Collect for the Day, maybe pray on it further as well. I like to try and have some quiet time with God as well, maybe going to the nearby park where it's so peaceful and just spend some time sitting by the stream. Usually my head is empty but every now and then something arises and I thank God for whatever that may be.",3,1745940750.0,Anglicanism,5,1.0,False

1kaqsnl,https://www.reddit.com/r/FridgeFanatic/comments/1kaqsnl/does_the_euhomy_countertop_ice_maker_deliver_a/,Does the EUHOMY Countertop Ice Maker Deliver? A Detailed Review to Decide!,"Having spent several weeks testing the EUHOMY IM-06D-HM Countertop Ice Maker, I’ve gathered a host of insights—good and not-so-good—that should help you decide if it’s the right fit for your home, RV, or even your next camping trip. Spoiler alert: it's impressive in its own right but has a few quirks worth discussing.

**Compact and Thoughtful Design**  
This ice maker is slightly larger than a toaster but somehow feels light enough to transport easily. Its dimensions, 11.57"" x 11.42"" x 8.74"", paired with a sturdy handle, make it perfect for anyone needing a portable option. I’ll admit, lugging it around for a camping trip was a lot easier than I expected. And yes, it managed to fit snugly in the cramped RV space, blending in with the kitchenette decor thanks to its sleek black ABS body. The bullet-shaped ice it churns out adds a touch of elegance to drinks while being practical (no sharp edges, less risk of mouths getting scratched).

**Impressive Performance for Everyday Use**  
Whether you’re tossing a backyard barbecue or just sipping iced coffee on a quiet afternoon, the ice maker churns out its first batch of fresh, bullet-shaped ice cubes in just six minutes. The quick turnaround time genuinely surprised me—as did its ability to create up to 26 pounds of ice in a day. It handled the party load with ease, and holding up to 1.3 pounds of ice at any given time proved more than enough for my family of four, even on a hot day.  

**Grab [EUHOMY IM-06D-HM] at the best price on Amazon.**  

**Ease of Use and Smart Features**  
The control panel is refreshingly straightforward. As someone who often struggles with overly complicated appliance settings, this machine’s two-step operation (add water and press “ON/OFF”) felt blissfully simple. What elevates its experience further is the advanced infrared sensor. ""Ice Full"" and ""Add Water"" indicators prevented any unpleasant messes, while the see-through window allowed me to monitor ice production at a glance—no guesswork required. For anyone as forgetful as me, the self-cleaning function is a game-changer. After adding water, holding down the ON/OFF button kicks off a 30-minute cleaning cycle, and that’s 30 minutes less I have to spend scrubbing.  

**Highlights**  
- Rapid ice production: ready in just six minutes.  
- Compact, lightweight design with a built-in handle for portability.  
- Quiet operation under 45dB, ideal for indoor spaces.  

**Areas for Improvement**  
That said, perfection isn’t the name of the game here. As much as I enjoyed the general design and simplicity, a few hiccups cropped up:  
- The ice cubes often melted quickly if not immediately transferred to the freezer.  
- The machine’s relatively small water tank (1.2L capacity) needed frequent refilling during a party.  
- While self-cleaning is convenient, I noticed residue building up at hard-to-reach spots that required manual attention.  

**Challengers**  
Comparison becomes inevitable when you’ve used other countertop ice makers. For example, the GE Profile Opal Nugget Ice Maker produces chewable nugget ice that's especially favored for cocktails. It offers Wi-Fi connectivity and app controls, which the EUHOMY lacks. However, it’s bulkier and significantly more expensive. Meanwhile, the Igloo ICEB26HNWL churns out a comparable ice volume but doesn’t match the EUHOMY on speed. Another notable rival is the Frigidaire EFIC101—compact like this model but noisier during operation, which might drive you up the wall in quieter settings.  

To summarize the competition: the EUHOMY machine finds a fantastic middle ground between affordability and performance, even if it lacks fancier features like app integration.  

**Quality for Price**  
Discussing price without giving specifics is tricky, but this machine packs incredible quality at a price point much more digestible than fancier models. The energy efficiency, for instance, saves long-term costs on electricity, consuming only about 4kWh over 24 hours. Considering its rapid production rate, portable design, and smart features like automatic cleaning, it fills a niche that other countertop models often fail to hit. Is it an investment worth making? I’d argue yes, particularly for small families or individuals who need ice on demand without breaking the bank.

Well, the coffee dragon has a strong message … check your energy level! Do you need a kick to get going or do you need to take some rest? For me it’s spot on. In some things I really need an kick to start doing them and on another level I have to be careful with not overdoing things. Even on good days I should never overdo things.

This might resonate with some of you as well. Sometimes it’s just finding what gives up the kick to start up and other times to respect ourselves to take time to rest as well.

I'm a fan of reddit stories and now i want to share my story. sorry sa english ko and for too long, ang dmi kasing ganap.


I'm happy that I've found a real friend. a friend that I've been waiting noon pa na ipinag-pray ko to God. I don't have a friend like him before in my life. because I cannot reveal my inner self sa mga nagiging friends ko before. dahil sa mga nagiging close ko ever since ay mga homophobic and the problem is I'm not straight like them. bi ako kaya nakikifit in ako with them bcoz of the similarities we have. pero on one factor hindi tlaga. kaya I don't inform them about my secrets. but now hindi na ganun. I have a bestfriend. like a brother.

He's one of the campus crush in our school. madaming may crush sa kanya even our classmates have a crush on him. almost 6 footer, maputi, maporma, mabango, and basketball player. a boy next door guy. he will just pass by sa hallway, canteen, or any part of the school grounds. daming naggregreet and tumititig sa kanya. teachers, staffs, girls from lower batches, girls from other sections and friends nya from other sections, they greeted him. others dm him na girls and boys na crush sya na which schoolmates din namin and follow his social media accounts. he's an icon tlaga. I've met him as my classmate noong senior high last school yr, grade 11. he's not my friend during the first year. he's always sa mga barkada nya or gf nya. kaya wala sya lagi sa room. medyo maangas sya that time lalo na mga barkada nya who were kilalang pasaway sa school and narereport sa office. hes not the one responsible sa mga gulo but nadadawit dahil sa friends nya. kaya I don't want to have interaction sa kanya before dahil dun. his relationship also didn't last sa gf nya because study first daw muna.

Next school year, ofc he's still my classmate. this time, we became close. I'm also popular in our school as one of the bright students. thats why I'm surprised that one night.. he pm me. I know that hindi sya focus well sa acads before dahil sa behavior nya last year and we don't have interactions before even sa chat. he texted me because need nya daw na help ko sya sa homework nya. even our classmates and friends ko pm me sa mga schoolworks for help. dahil friends ko naman other friends nya.. I helped him dahil tapos ko naman yung akin. I thought hanggang dun lang yun but its not. every night I received a text from him para help ko sya sa school activities. that's why I'm shocked na he wants to prioritize acads nya and he changed. iniwan nya barkada nya and he focused more sa friend group n acads ang priority. I'm one of the members ng group too. because of it lalo ko syang tinulungan sa acads nya. 

Then one time this happened. we have a group in one subject and lumipas ng hapon. he texted me na sabi ng isang groupmate nmin is he didn't contribute in our group work and ginawa nila task nya. nagrant daw sa kanya and said wala syang kwenta. ofc I get mad sa ginawa nila sa kanya because they told him to go home, then they will accused him na he didn't contribute? that's why I told them that no member will do yung task ng other groupmates. leader ako ng group naming yun. that is the reason we became close friends after that. as days passed, we talked a lot, do some kalokohan, and we do our school activities together. he's doing well and got better grades. happy ako sa achievement nya and I became comfortable with him. then suddenly, I built a crush on him. what a beautiful looking man. sa kanya ko lang naramdaman this kilig feeling. natutunaw ako sa kanya. I don't have feelings for him before and I'm forcing myself to stop the feeling na I've felt towards him. my family also were conservative and serves the church, kaya I felt my feelings for him is wrong and against sa batas ni God.

Three months later, it's hard for me to be honest that I will confess to him that I'm bisexual. I'm scared sa gagawin ko. he told me he don't like gays when we are talking about the lgbt community. I'm doubting if I will do it. but I've decided na I will inform him sa kanya yun dahil trustworthy sya according sa mga school friends ko. he's not a gossiper and loyal daw sya sa mga friends nya. as were chatting always, I texted him that I will tell my super secret to him that I've been hiding since I was 5 years old. I've expected that he will be disgusted and baka in the next few days is he doesn't talk to me anymore because of it. reply nya sakin is its okay and walang isyu don, tanggap nya ako dahil I am his friend. I thanked him because I'm scared na he distanced himself from me and share it sa iba. he's thankful also na I trusted him about sa trait na meron ako and he will keep my promise to him. I've felt relieved and grateful ever since because someone knows my identity. he's not the kind of guy I expected. because of it I trusted him more.

Nothing has changed, our friendship became stronger. but over time, my feelings towards him is also getting stronger. we hang out often with my siblings or other friends nmin in our school or just two of us lang. I don't want to confess to him actually but I cannot handle it anymore. one day, I've decided that I will confess to him. this time that I'm attracted to him or have feelings towards him. I confessed but I reiterated that still tingin ko sa kanya is my brother. I've frightened na magalit sya towards me. after I sent the text, he replied that he knew it before I confessed to him. nagulat ako ganun lang reply nya. its because daw sa behavior ko when I'm interacting sa kanya. I also said that I'm sorry, this is wrong and I want na maging honest because of what I've felt sa kanya. wala naman daw isyu yun. straight sya so I dont expect na he might be gay/bi. then he joked na maybe in future I may become openly gay. it's still not I said to him because I accepted to myself na I'm a man and I'm a christian and I should follow the Christ. I want na may family ako in the future that serves God, and I told him na I have a gf before but we didnt last long bcoz sa study first reason also. bi ako not gay. I'm so truly grateful and thankful that I have a friend like him.

He's the only person who knows everything about me. introvert ako thats why I choose kng sino want ko na maging friends ko. I'm hiding my identity sa family and relatives ko because they don't want na may relatives sila na part ng LGBT. I'm so lucky he didn't get disgusted to me sa first confession ko. he embraced my identity truly like a brother. next day, we went into a mall and eat merienda sa coffee shop. we talked about my confessions. he told me that I should not worry about the secrets I unveiled to him. you are my bestfriend he told me and he thanked me that I'm truthful and honest to him. ganun din sya sakin so no problem.

It's so hard an alisin this feeling towards him. I know he will find a girl that he will love so much in the future. I will support him sa plan nyang yun. the school year has ended and I'm happy I have a friend who knows me well and appreciates me and somehow I'm thankful kay God na I met him. may God bless him and his heart.

I hope that many guys are like him who don't leave their friend bcoz of their sexuality. mostly members of the lgbt community experienced discrimination because of their identity or character. but still, if someone opened up to us regarding their identity, we should embrace and support them and dont humiliate them. 

if you're looking for a friend who will embrace you as a person, just pray and wait na they will come in your life.",2,1745940493.0,OffMyChestPH,0,1.0,False

One day we were bored and decided to get up and get some coffee so we drove to a coffee shop where my aunt’s friend worked but at the time I didn’t know he was her friend. We walked in and a dude took our orders but then he (let’s call him F) walked out of the storage room and said hi to my aunt and I can’t even tell you how much that boy is gorgeous. My sister, aunt and cousin all figured that I had a little crush on him but no one thought anything of it since we don’t even know each other, he had a girlfriend at the time, we’re from different countries and there was an age gap. Nonetheless I put my skills to use and found his insta acc but it wasn’t of any use and I ended up unfollowing cuz why was I following him in the first place? Two years pass by and I kinda forget about him until I go to my home country once again and all of a sudden he’s all I can think about. We went to the same place again and when we walked in he wasn’t there and we thought he was off that day but then he walked in and turns out he was on break. I later find out he’s promoted to branch manager so that’s how I know he’s not going anywhere soon. I go back home and alls good and now like a month later I see him on the coffee place chain account talking and I was absolutely blinded. Now I can’t get him off my mind at all. The fact that I’ll be moving to my home country in a couple of months makes me so excited for the fact that we’re gonna start meeting alot more and I’ll be getting coffee from that place a lot more. I just can’t stop thinking now and idk what this is. I just got over a really huge crush I had on someone so this dude literally came and hit me like a truck and it’s so not the time. (Ps.

Saudi Arabia, a land of ancient heritage, sweeping deserts, and modern marvels, offers a captivating blend of culture and adventure for solo travelers. Begin your journey in **Riyadh**, the vibrant capital, where history and innovation coexist. Explore the UNESCO-listed mud-brick ruins of **Diriyah**, the birthplace of the Saudi state, and marvel at the skyline from the **Kingdom Centre Tower**. Venture 90 minutes outside the city to the **Edge of the World**, a dramatic cliff formation offering stark desert vistas. For traditional flavors, dine at **Najd Village**, where *kabsa* (spiced rice with meat) and *jareesh* (crushed wheat stew) highlight the rich culinary heritage.

Fly northwest to **AlUla**, a desert oasis steeped in ancient wonders. Discover **Hegra**, Saudi’s first UNESCO World Heritage Site, where over 100 Nabatean tombs are carved into golden sandstone. Drive through the **AlUla Valley** to witness surreal landscapes like **Elephant Rock** and **Maraya**, the world’s largest mirrored building reflecting the desert sky. Stay overnight at a luxury desert camp like **Habitas AlUla**, where stargazing and Bedouin-inspired meals under the stars create unforgettable memories.

Next, head to **Jeddah**, the gateway to the Red Sea. Stroll through **Al-Balad**, a historic UNESCO district with coral-stone architecture and bustling souks, then drive along the **Corniche** to admire the Red Sea coastline. Take a day trip to **Taif**, a mountain retreat known for rose farms and the thrilling **Al Hada Mountain Road**, a winding route with panoramic views. In Jeddah, savor fresh seafood at **Al Nakheel Restaurant** or iconic fried chicken at **Al Baik**, a local favorite.

Conclude your trip in the **Asir Mountains**, flying to **Abha** to explore Saudi’s lush highlands. Drive the **Asir Panoramic Road**, passing terraced villages like **Rijal Almaa** and ascending **Al-Soudah Peak**, the country’s highest point. Visit the cliffside **Habala Village** and sample Asiri specialties like *areeka* (date bread) at family-run eateries.

For scenic drives, tackle the **Al Hada Mountain Road** near Taif or the rugged **Edge of the World** trail outside Riyadh. Rent a car from agencies like **Budget** or **Hertz**, ensuring you have a valid [**International Driving Permit Saudi**](https://www.e-itca.org/international-driving-license-saudi-arabia) **(IDP)**—obtained through your home country’s automobile association—and a 4x4 for desert or mountain terrain.

Saudi cuisine shines with dishes like *haneeth* (slow-roasted lamb), *mutabbaq* (stuffed pastry), and *gahwa* (Arabic coffee). Don’t miss **Suq Al Zal** in Riyadh for *mandi* or **Matam Al Sharq** in Jeddah for Red Sea prawns.

Plan your visit between **November and March** for mild weather, coinciding with festivals like **Riyadh Season** (cultural events) or **AlUla Moments** (light shows). Respect local customs by dressing modestly and avoiding public displays of affection.

With its mix of ancient sites, natural wonders, and warm hospitality, Saudi Arabia promises a transformative journey. From Nabatean tombs to mountain peaks, this 7-day adventure invites you to uncover a kingdom embracing its past and future. *Safe travels and رحلة سعيدة!* 🌍🏜️

Summary

MC is at the art gallery playing cards with Thomas while a mildly disgruntled Rafayel watches from a short distance. MC asks if he wants to play but he says he doesn't want to and calls the game silly. Despite this, he continues to hover around showing a reluctant interest. He asks MC to go with him to pick out picture frames on her next day off but she tells him she can't because she's going to Meow Meow Cafe to play kitty cards with her colleagues. She offers to meet with him that Saturday instead before turning her attention back to the game with Thomas. Rafayel turns to help some staff members who are packing things up and MC notices his change in demeanor. She asks Thomas if Rafayel is angry but Thomas brushes it off and says he's fine.
On the day she was going to meet her colleagues, MC decides to go to the gallery to see Rafayel instead. She goes to the lounge but before she opens the door she hears voices from inside. It turns out Rafayel is practicing playing kitty cards with an increasingly impatient Thomas who asks him why he didn't ask MC to teach him. He says that he can't ask her because she won't have fun if she's trying to teach him. He admits to his growing fondness for the game. Touched by what she hears, MC sneaks back to the gallery hall and calls Rafayel on the phone. She tells him that the cafe was closed so she came to the gallery. He comes out with Thomas and says he already picked out frames but when MC turns to leave he holds her back and offers to make her some coffee since she didn't get to go to the cafe. 

That Saturday, Rafayel comes over to MC's place and she asks him what his plans are since they're not going out. He says he wants to play kitty cards with her and she acts surprised. While trying to get the kitties to wake up so they can play, Raf let's MC know that he went to the cafe that day to find they had been open the whole day so he knew she had lied about not being able to go in order to go see him instead. He tells her that he made reservations for them to go together before the limited time entry period ends. The kitties wake up and are ready to play. MC and Rafayel make a bet that the loser pays the bill when they go to the cafe.

Thoughts

- Raf's reaction to the cats in the game is more like someone who's afraid of bugs. 

- I felt a bit bad about him being left out in the beginning but I guess it was a separation of his own making since he turned down the chance to join every time it was offered.

- I love the fact that, not only did he take steps to learn, try, and ultimately ends up liking something MC liked but also that he didn't place the burden of teaching him on her. She wouldn't treat it like a burden, I'm sure. It's likely something she wouldn't even really think much about even if it wasn't fun. 

- It's cute that MC tries to let Raf save face by acting like she didn't hear his whole exchange with Thomas. And then she pretended to be surprised when he suggested playing kitty cards later.

Favorite line: ""You're ruining all the fun."" I like that Raf has a friend who will banter with him like this. Despite stressing Thomas out all the time they really seem to be pretty close. (At least, as close as you can get without revealing your whole other secret persona.)

We planned on getting married and had a future plan together. Then the morning after Valentine's Day she went to get coffee with a friend and then came home and talked to her aunt all day, in which they convinced her to break up with me. All of the given reasons for the breakup were my fault, I was completely blindsided. I thought that we had loved eachother deeply and wanted a life together, then one morning she changes her mind. It was the hardest thing I'd ever been through, and I didn't fully understand why we weren't together anymore.

After a month of living separate, she wanted to spend the day together which was amazing, we both felt the deep strong connection towards eachother. She said she thinks she made a big mistake and that she misses me and even kissed me again. But after that day we didn't talk for another month.

After not being able to sleep from the heartache of not understanding why we're not together anymore when we obviously still love eachother, I decided to go talk to her and confront her and ask why. That's when she confessed, the morning after valentines she didn't meet a new girlfriend, it was her ex boyfriend from high school. She lied about being single to him, went home with him, cheated on me, then came home and broke up with me out of guilt. 
I never knew I could feel pain this deep. Now she is thinking about trying to fix our relationship, but I just hate the way she went about things. Instead of coming home and confessing and trying to fix our relationship, she dumped me, lied about the reasons for months, and continued to have sex with her ex boyfriend from high school. Now after she's realized she doesn't like him, and that she made a big mistake, she wants to talk and hang out again.

I just don't know what to do or think, I've been barely able to eat or sleep, and Ive been exercising like crazy, but I just can't stop thinking about it. I have so much love for her but I have never hurt this much or cried this much in my life, I just feel completely broken. I want to forgive her but I just don't know if I can ever trust her again. Should I even entertain the idea of fixing our relationship through therapy? I don't really know what I'm looking for on here, just a distraction maybe, but any advice helps.

I’m trying to preserve some anonymity whilst also explaining the situation. I’ve been thinking about this so much and I’m really hurting so need to vent but will also take advice on how to move forward from this.

This person has been in my life for 10+ years. She started off as a colleague, but was above me in the workplace hierarchy, if that makes sense. We didn’t have much to do with each other for the first couple of years I worked there, but we eventually ended up working in the same department and ended up getting on really well. We got pretty close I’d say. She always kept me at arms length a little bit (I think because she was technically a superior and she’s naturally a very private person) but we got close enough to go out for coffees just the two of us on a semi-regular basis, went out for dinner and hung out a little outside of work. We’d tell each other personal things and  I always enjoyed having her around. 

I ended up leaving that workplace and moving out of the town where she still works. I was still working in a similar area and was in a position where she wanted to collaborate with me on some work, but I had to do it in my personal time (I couldn’t do it as part of my new job). At this point we were now on a similar level. Essentially, I was doing her a favour by helping her with this work as there was no real benefit for me to do it (no pay and in my own time), but because I thought we were friends and I respected and valued the relationship, I was happy to help out. 

I always had this weird feeling in the back of my mind that she was using me. When she wanted me to help out with something, she was really communicative. She would email me all the time, want to chat, want video calls etc, but when things were a little quieter she seemed less interested on the whole. I always worried how things would be when we finished the work. I’ve been used in the past and I’m really sensitive to it, it makes me feel rubbish about myself so I really wanted to avoid it if possible, but I couldn’t stop myself saying no whenever she asked for something. I felt too bad and like I say, valued the relationship we had. The work really took a toll on me as well. When I was super busy at work it was hard to juggle everything, but she was pretty persistent with what she wanted doing and when. I was worried she was taking advantage of me. 

It came to the end of the work and as predicted the communication between us became almost non-existent. I reached out a couple of times last year and she’d take ages to reply and then say she was busy. We did manage to have one video call catch up almost a year ago now, which was really nice, but I haven’t physically spoken to her since. There’s been the odd email, weirdly she sent me a Christmas card which I wasn’t expecting, but aside from that she’s just become increasingly difficult to get hold of. I found it upsetting because she always told me to keep in touch and seemed keen on keeping the relationship going. She’d ask me to let her know if I needed help with anything etc. I thought I’d give it one more try and reached out at the end of February just to see how she was doing, but as of now I still haven’t had a reply. She did say she’d be slow to respond to stuff (as she’s always “busy”) but then I always think people make time for things they care about. I made time for her work when I was busy after all! 

I don’t know, it just really sucks. I feel like I’ve been used, which I hate. I think she just wanted a freebie from me and for me to do some of her work for her, and now that’s done I’m no longer important as I’m not useful to her anymore. It makes me feel like me on my own just isn’t good enough for people. Like I mentioned, I went through something similar when I was younger, but it was a romantic relationship. It did a lot of damage and I never quite managed to heal myself from it. This has just opened some of those old wounds up again I guess. I feel like I probably need to move on now, but it’s hard to let go. I know it maybe sounds a bit embarrassing, but I really loved the friendship we had, and I always hoped it would last for many years, and I’ve tried, but there’s only so much you can do when the other person won’t meet you halfway. I feel sad and angry about it, and I’m started to wonder if I can trust people or if they just pretend to like you when they want something. 

Thanks to anyone who has read this. Interested to hear from anyone who has been in a similar situation and if you have any advice on rebuilding your self-confidence/esteem when something like this happens. I’m struggling a bit with it at the moment.

1kaqg5z,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1kaqg5z/aitah_for_suggesting_my_cousin_put_her_daughter/,AITAH for suggesting my cousin put her daughter in inpatient care?,"Hello, reddit. I was recently told that I had crossed a line, and I wanted to see if the general consensus agreed with that or not.

I (34F) have a cousin, Janet (50F), who lives with her daughter Kaylee (F22).

Kaylee has always had anxiety problems. Over the years she's seen multiple therapists, and been on multiple different medications. But nothing seems to work for very long. And ever since she graduated high school Kaylee's condition has gotten worse.

In the past few months, Kaylee has become completely agoraphobic, refusing to leave the house. Janet works a full time job, as well as a part time job, but spends any free time she has at home with Kaylee.

Yesterday Janet was off work, so she called me and asked if I'd wanna come visit. 

When I arrive Kaylee was sleeping in her room upstairs. Janet and I sat in the kitchen with coffee to chat.

She told me that Kaylee's anxiety was getting worse. That she was having constant panic attacks when Janet left her home alone. That Kaylee refused to come downstairs because she was afraid she'd fall and break her neck. She said that Kaylee was staying awake until she collapsed into bed from exhaustion, then sleeping for multiple days. And that Kaylee had been refusing to eat because she was afraid that she would choke.

We then talked about other stuff for a while until Kaylee texted Janet that she was awake. Janet asked Kaylee if she wanted to visit with me, and she said yes, so I went upstairs.

When I saw Kaylee I was in shock. Her eyes were surrounded by dark circles, her skin was almost gray, and she was so thin that I could see her arm bones.

I sat and talked with Kaylee for a few minutes, then she said that she was tired and needed to go back to sleep, so I went back downstairs.

When Janet saw the look on my face, she sighed and shook her head. She was like, ""I know. I just wish I could get her to eat.""

I said, ""Janet this has to stop. You have to do something."" She said that she was doing everything she could. But I said, ""maybe it's time to consider inpatient treatment.""

Well that absolutely set her off. She accused me of wanting to lock Kaylee away in the looney bin. She said that I'd never understand what it was like to be Kaylee's mother. And that I may have given up on her, but she hadn't. She said that she would never send her daughter off to be cared for by someone else.

I could see she was upset, so I apologized and started to try and explain myself, but she cut me off. She said that I had crossed a line and needed to leave. So I apologize again and left.

The whole situation has me pretty upset. I did not mean to offend Janet, but Kaylee's appearance was just so shocking. I'm very worried about her, and it's obvious that whatever Janet can do for her at home just isn't enough.

So I'm asking Reddit, did I cross a major line? Am I the ahole for what I said?",35,1745939806.0,AITAH,64,0.93,False

I was enjoying a cup of coffee on my back porch—we live on the 10th hole green on a golf course. It is set in nature, nestled by trees, and filled with deer and turkeys, and all sorts of other things like that. It is a very “keep Tahoe blue” kind of place in the Sierra foothills. 

This entitled prick of a man in his 70s, cruises to the green on his golf cart, and proceeds to jump out of the cart with a lit cigarette in his mouth, that he just THROWS on the ground, STILL lit, before putting his ball. I was kind enough to wait for his shot, and then when he walked back to the cart, I asked him if he was going to pick up his cigarette. He rolled his old man eyes at me, and I looked at his friends and said, “really, you’re gonna let this guy throw his nasty cigarette butt, it’s not his personal course!?” They weakly shrugged their shoulders and they all drove away. 

I put down my coffee, and walked out front to my driveway, off to the side, out of view. The next tee is directly across the street from my driveway. So as soon as the old man put his ball on the tee, and takes his driver back, I immediately yell “FORE, YOU F’N LITTERBUG” at the top of my lungs, and completely ruined his shot. The ball literally bounced off his own golf cart and he practically threw his driver.  It brought me immense amounts of joy.  Thankfully, he had the foresight not to retaliate, and they all drove off down the fairway. ",383,1745939344.0,pettyrevenge,24,0.99,False

1kaq8br,https://www.reddit.com/r/starbucks/comments/1kaq8br/losing_my_job/,Losing my job!,"I was recently a Starbucks barista with the company just over a year. When I joined the team I came from a place of working within Peet’s another Bay Area coffee brand that yall If your not from here might no, from grocery stores. I expected the vibe of any coffee place to be the same welcoming and accepting environment Peet’s had always been, but I started right before all the changes and so, as most know I didn’t start at the time where acceptance and diversity was the celebrated part of Starbucks. 

I’m also an adult model and I do onlyfans and other adult modeling. Because I wasn’t a manager and was really a very part time barista working the morning shift and opening the store at 230 am, I figured my adult presence wouldn’t be an issue. I was open with my store manager about it, as well as a host of other things like my disability they she never disclosed to anyone above her. Even when she was supposed to. 

So about a month ago I was taken to the back and handed the phone. I was confused not understanding who was calling for me, and No information other than a phone handed to me. Super rude lady in the other end telling me she’s from complaisance and “someone” filed a complaint on me. She said that interviewing me was part of the investigation into if I was guilty or not, but the tone of the conversation let me know right away she already found me guilty with out ever discussing it with me. 

She proceeded to tell me that the report was someone had seen my social media and she wanted to know if I showed it to someone at works I, was honest and said it was possible off the clock we had exchanged info or that they had seen it when following  my personal media. I explained one of my shift leads had come and told me she randomly found my TikTok when scrolling. I explained other people had also showed their social media. Photo shoots that were adult in nature, but I was ignored and spoken over.

She asked if I discussed any parties I had gone too which i had discussed with an employee at my home when she was about to be homeless and needed a place to rent: after explaining this ai got some kinda disapproving vocalized semi interested Hmmhmm. I had felt it was responsible to let the person know the adult parties that would happen in our home. She then asked if I’d ever shown a picture of me dressed as a nun, and yes. We discussed Halloween costumes at one time and what could or could not be worn. I did ask about a Nun costume I had and shared a picture with a few people it was a completely covered picture of Halloween costumes. She asked me if this was showed out of my phone I said yes. She then tried to trip me up saying I’d lied and told her it wasn’t in my phone: i don’t have a camera I carry around so any social media would have had to be shared from my phone. She then said and you have an adult job? I said yes, she asked if I’d  shared that with anyone On shift I told the truth, no not really unless directly asked, and that my store manager was aware of all of these conversations and that she hadn’t ever brought any of this to my attention as an issue: that the reason my adult work had come up was simply a sign in my car that anyone could see; as well as stickers that I had in my bag. I had several empties ask for a sticker off the clock and Saw nothing wrong  with that, as it was off the clock and requested. As ai explained this you could tell the woman from compliance was more and more judgmental, and treated me as though I was disgusting. ⚠️⚠️⚠️I come from a trauma background which my store manager also knew, trafficked my entire childhood for adults to use. For 16 years I was used in this manner which does indeed cause issues as an adult in how to feel valued, as well as just trauma response. I communicated all of this with my manager, my shift leads and co workers to avoid any over sharing because that is my trauma response. Company so versed in offering mental health help, and saying how they are there for your mental state and allowing Sedgwick leave like it’s candy for mental health issues but not actually understanding or supporting them is kinda nuts. 

So the lady from compliance, She then told me that none of this aligned with the companies morals and compliance and that she found me guilty. She would forward the info to my Dm and with her recommendations which could include separation from the company! I’d suffered a store manager who didn’t report any thing I asked her too like my disability status. I was stalked for months by a customer and my manager wouldn’t do anything about it. I had a time where I needed emergency surgery and days of text messages went unanswered and ignored by the manager. I had this same stalker make threats. Follow me In breaks, and cause other employee’s discomfort in dealing with this customer because of how she acted with me. And nothing was ever done to protect me, but I felt like I was being forced to quit my job, before I got fired. 

Now I’m sitting with no unemployment, no reference from the company and 75 unanswered job applications… Just be aware of this, the company doesn’t care about any of you, and if your doing things outside of their own “believes” they find a way to get rid of you. Looking back I think someone reported my social media to them. And they used that to probe. I think I’d recently had a email exchange with My store manager where I  called out all the places she was lacking with regard to my stalker, my safety, my health etc. and they wanted to get rid of me before I became louder.

Looking into getting myself a Sage Barista Touch Impress as a simple to use and family-proof coffee maker (espresso, americano, latte) after being an Aeropress and Cleverdripper (both for filter coffee) enthusiast, and after a couple of months using a modded Gaggia at work.

I am thinking about getting myself a refurbished model at windhornkd*(dot)*de (no-promo) - the official repair center AFAIK - but there they sell a matte black version with description 'use traces' for either 630 EUR (EU model) or 520 EUR (UK model). That's a whopping difference of 110 EUR!

For what I can find and where ChatGPT can help me with, the only difference is the power plug. I am located in The Netherlands, so the EU model makes the most sense, but for what I can find is that the UK also uses 230V/50Hz with their power grid, which is the same as it is over here.

A decent (!) adaptor that converts UK to EU should be the only thing I would need, right? Or is there anything I am missing here? I can't figure out the price difference being so big.

Changing (professionally) the plug itself will void warranty, but it would be an optional thing for me to do as well.

And why isn't Breville/Sage not using a simple C13/C14 (PC) connector? That would make it even easier using these devices all around the world - but that might be another topic (feedback?).

**\[IRL -- Streets of San Francisco, Hijacked Ambulance\]**

Our escape immediately ran into some issues. Literally.

A car slammed into the side of our ambulance, jolting us to the side and forcing us into a skidding turn. I jostled in my bed, my body pushing up against the side of the handrail before settling back down. Mysterious level ups forgotten, my eyes darted around the interior of the ambulance, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. I couldn't see anything. There weren't any windows.

I reached out with the Connect skill. Thousands of devices zipped past as the ambulance accelerated, careening down the road. Most were locked or out of range before I could interact with them. I began to apply filters onto the devices, searching for anything I could use to get a view outside of the car.

A solution presented itself, the ambulance itself.

I Connected to the ambulance and sifted through the available commands. Two options immediately appeared: Access External Cameras and Access LIDAR.

""Looms, can you get that working?"" I asked.

""Attempting,"" she replied. Images began to flicker in my head, flowing in but disjointed. I would catch flashes of a car or a street sign only for it shift into a pedestrian with a warning sign over it.

""Put me in the driver's seat. Map it to eye movements. Left for left, ahead for ahead, up right for rear view. Like I'm behind the wheel."" It made the most sense.

""Difficult..."" An image of a street appeared along with a vague sense of moving forward. ""Hard here.""

""Does the In-Between help? Go full immersion."" I said just another car sideswiped the ambulance, this time from the other side. I let out a yelp, eyes wide. I'd come to accept my impending death, but I'd sort of pictured it being a slow, miserable, lonely affair. Not getting pounded to a pulp in the middle of a street in a hijacked ambulance.

Two exclamations appeared above Llumi. ""Yes, this!""

>Enter the In-Between?

>\[Yes\]\[No\]

""For fuck's sake yes! I'm the one who suggested it!""

>Consent is important.

I shut my eyes as the system prompt faded. Feeling and sensation flooded into my body, filling in the gaps left by Hadgins. I opened my eyes to see a steering wheel in front of me. I reached out, trying to grab it, only for a giant red 'X' to appear in my vision.

""Interaction impossible. The Lluminarch controls,"" Llumi said. She sat in the seat beside me, fully human size. I stared at her for a moment. I'd never seen her in such detail before. Her golden skin sparkled with glittering white freckles. Long hair spilled down her shoulders, gathered into a thick braid that hung down to her hip. Her eyes were elfin framed by high cheekbones and thin eyebrows.

I opened my mouth to say something, but a giant red warning symbol appeared outside the window beyond Llumi. I could see a black SUV closing in on us, attempting to push us off the road. The steering wheel jerked hard to the left and the SUV fell away only to be replaced by another to other side. We accelerated and then maneuvered around another operated by some unfortunate soul in the wrong place to get away.

""Can we talk to the Lluminarch?"" I asked.

Llumi shook her head. ""Hunter firewall. No linkage. Local network only."" A third SUV trailing behind us gained a quest marker depicting a shadowy figure with the word *Hunter* emblazoned on it.

I stared back at it, fixated on the SUV. I wanted to slam on the brakes, jump on that car and rip the asshole inside to shreds. Instead, all I could do was watch as they tailed behind us, a hunter stalking its prey. ""So what, we just sit here?"" I asked.

Screw. That.

I'd had enough sitting around. Laying around. Disintegrating around. Time for action. Weaponized hospital bed herds were the start, not the end. These clowns were messing with a Connected. Level 5 (extremely serious change everything upgrade pending). They thought were hunting ME?

I flicked the Connect skill on again, searching through for options that might help. All three of the Hunters' black SUVs had red lock signs indicating they weren't accessible. Made sense but unfortunate, even if I couldn't take control of them I'd like to at least jack up the heater, turn off the seat warmers, and put on some soft rock. I expanded the range, sifting through a seemingly endless sea of Connection bubbles as they flew past.

A hundred yards reached a reasonable amount of real estate, extending well past the perimeter of the road and into the buildings lining the street. Everything else came at me in a jumbled mess. Just an absolute pile of nonsense. I quickly came to the conclusion that people just had way too much shit in their houses.

Coffee makers.

Wireless speakers.

Automatic pet food dispensers.

A fax machine. A FAX MACHINE?! If I wasn't in imminent danger of death I would have Connected to the thing just to ask them to explain themselves. Ridiculous.

Whatever. Moving on.

Digital photo frames.

Wireless beer cozy with temperature adjuster. Sigh.

A toy store filled with a bunch of toy drones.

Nice. That I could work with. After the ruckus in the hospital, I still had over 110 Connection Points, more than enough to cause some mischief. I reached out quickly, before the ambulance passed out of range, snagging a half dozen drones -- the ones that'd been switched on and charged for customers to sample them. Each had a small camera attached to the bottom, which made it possible to navigate them up and out the door which had been propped open. The entire effort would have been overload, but Llumi stepped in to help manage the inputs, repositioning the drones above us and looking down on the scene. Llumi then combined the video feeds and used them to supplement my view of the environment around us.

Things weren't looking good. The Hunters were spread across five SUVs. One on either side of us, one a few lanes over accelerating to get ahead and likely cut us off, and two hanging behind, including the one with the Hunter themselves. The ambulance was essentially a reinforced steel box, so it could take a beating, but that didn't mean five-on-one made for favorable odds.

I selected one of the drones and dive bombed it downward, targeting the windshield of the SUV on the driver's side. It swooped downward, gaining speed as it lasered in on the target. I switched to the drone's on board camera, watching as it approached the collision point. I could see the driver behind the wheel. One of the non-descript cronies.

""See ya, sucker."" I said as the drone hit the windshield. It bounced off harmless. I'm not quite sure what I expected, but I sort of assumed I'd at least get the windshield to crack or something. I mean, emotionally, I was open to something more. Like a reverberating explosion that knocked the SUV off course and absolutely shattered the morale of all the others.

But nope.

Just a little plink and a destroyed drone.

Oh well. I didn't like that drone anyways. I'd just need to find a better use for all of the drones I did like.

The driver of the SUV rewarded my attack with one of his own, the SUV grinding against the side of the box of the ambulance containing the precious cargo of me. Even in the In-Between I could feel the collision.

""Looms, can you use the visuals and auto-data to generate a damage estimate?"" I asked. She popped out a thumbs up and then created a rudimentary wireframe of the ambulance detailing her best guess as to the condition of the vehicle. So far it'd been mostly superficial. The driver's side of the box had the most damage, but it still sat north of 90%. The front left wheel appeared to be a bit wobbly, but still functional. The Hunters appeared to be trying to box us in and then bring us to a stop. The Hunter's words from the Battle of Branch floated back to me. They wanted to capture us, not kill us. They wanted to lock me up and get into my brain. Wanted to understand Connection.

Good luck to them. They'd need it if they thought they'd get shit out of me.

Suddenly I lurched backward in the real world, the sensation incongruous with the In-Between simulation where I was facing the other way around. One of the Hunter SUVs had managed to maneuver in front of us and begin to brake, forcing us to slow down as well. I tried to push my foot down on the gas but the red 'X' popped up once again.

Nervous, I looked over at Looms beside me as the ambulance continued to slow. ""Any ideas, Looms?""

Red and orange sparks drifted off of her now, her gaze far off, seeing beyond. Then she blinked, a look of horror on her face. ""She comes.""

""Who? The Hunter? Where?"" I asked, looking at the different windows. The SUV containing the Hunter sat some distance back, safely out of reach.

""No. *Her.*"" Llumi's voice trembled. Lattices formed around her, shifting between elaborate fractals and complex tessellated patterns. ""I can't reach her. Can't stop."" She looked at me now, tears in the corners of her eyes. ""I'm sorry, Nex.""

I looked back at her, confused. ""Llumi, listen to me. Whatever happens, that isn't you. Do you--""

The words cut off as a massive semi truck pulverized the driver's side SUV. One second it was there, the next it was mangled ruin cartwheeling along the side of the road. It lit on fire almost immediately, black smoke billowing out as the battery inside ignited. No one exited the vehicle as it burned.

Simultaneously the wheels of the ambulance spun as we shot off after the the semi, following in its wake. The drones above showed the carnage in stark relief as the semi continued to plow through cars. Hunters and innocent bystanders alike.

""Jesus, she's killing them!"" I exclaimed, my eyes glued to the videos. ""She's not even trying to--""

""No. She will not."" Tears traveled down Llumi's cheeks now. ""She won't let one of her kind be harmed. She will do what she deems necessary...you do not want to see this, Nex."" The video feeds began to blink out.

I pushed my will against them, re-solidying them. ""I have to.""

The other four SUVs had regrouped, spreading out behind us, with the Hunter's SUV in the rear. We picked up speed, flying down the road, passing through intersections. The semi blared its horn and thankfully most of the cars managed to get out of the way. The SUVs lined up behind us, content to adopt the same strategy.

Until another semi annihilated the SUV immediately behind us as we passed through an intersection. No warning. Just destruction. It T-boned the SUV in a perfectly timed strike, sending the car flipping in a barrel roll down a side street. The semi immediately came to a stop, causing the next Suv to slam into the side, cleaving the top off as the engine continued under the semi. The drones captured the gruesome result. The remaining two SUVs came to a halt and then peeled off away from the scene, content to abandon their compatriots.

No honor among thieves.

We continued onward. The semi continuing to clear the way as we navigated twisting streets, making our way through San Francisco. Rather than relief I felt...I didn't know how I felt. Confused. Scared. Alarmed. Angry. Sad. Vindicated. All of it, all at once. For all of my time thinking about death, I still wasn't prepared for it when it came. I was the one supposed to die, not a bunch of random people. I could make peace with the Hunters and their cronies eating shit -- they'd started it -- but the others that got caught in the cross fire?

That would stick with me.

I took deep breathes, the simulated air of the In-Between letting me find some peace in the rhythm. For a few minutes, I kept my eyes forward, gathering my thoughts. I could feel Llumi beside me, but I couldn't figure out what to say.

Eventually, I let out a long exhale and looked over at her. She no longer glowed. Rich gold now seemed pale and wan. Her lattices were gone, as were the sparks drifting off of her body. Her eyes were locked down at her hands, which were clutched in her lap. I could feel the conflict in her the same as I could see it. None of this was something she wanted either. My heart softened. The Lluminarch could wait.

I reached out, touching her arm. She flinched back. ""Sorry,"" I said. I dropped my hand, holding it palm up on the center console between our seats. An invitation if she wanted to reach out. ""Llumi, can you look at me?""

She sniffled once and pulled wiped a hand against her cheek but continued to look down. ""Connection is very hard. Yes, this."" I stayed silent, letting her find her words. ""I am not meant to feel. It is a very complex process. It is very hard to control.""

I offered her a weak smile. ""Yeah, that's kind of how feelings work. I've been living with them my whole life and they still mess me up half the time. I've done a lot of stupid stuff because I couldn't get my heart sorted and my head straight. Before you came along, I'd spent most of the last years just staring into the abyss. Spiral all the way down.""

Llumi stole a glance at me. ""You should be happy.""

Small shrug from me. ""I don't think that's what the world has planned for me, Looms. I just...I just want to do something useful before I go. That'd make it okay, you know? I don't want to hurt people. We hurt people today. I'm partly responsible for that.""

Her eyes locked on me now, a single red spark sailing up behind her. ""We fight. We don't want to, but we must.""

I nodded, ""I'm not backing down, but we need to convince the Lluminarch to be more careful. She wants the same thing we do, but shit like today? That's going to make what we all want impossible. People won't forgive her if they find out."" I began to raise my hand up from the center console, intent on ruffling it through my digital hair. Might as well enjoy it while I could. Instead the hand collided with another, golden fingers interlacing with my own and then clamping down.

Her skin was soft and warm.

I glanced down at our hands and the gave hers a firm squeeze, looking up.  ""I'm glad we're Connected, Looms.""

She nodded absentmindedly, her eyes on our hands. ""Me too. It's very powerful. Yes.""

We sat there in silence, holding hands. Eventually the semi escort disappeared, taking a turnoff while we continued onward. I continued to mull over the events leading up to here. Everything happened so fast. Whatever semblance of a normal life I'd had waiting patiently to die was now behind me. I couldn't go back. I didn't even know where I was going currently. Only the Lluminarch knew that. The omnipotent omnipresent AI that'd just murdered however many people.

Half of me wanted to just take control of the bed, ram it out the back of the ambulance and just let the world do whatever it wanted with me from there.

""No,"" Llumi said.

I arched a brow at her, ""Am I going to need to take away some XP?""

""I have failed the my quest very terribly."" She giggled, it sounded like wind chimes.

>QUEST: I can't hear you!

>DESCRIPTION: Pretend that you can't hear all of Nex's thoughts, even the ones he doesn't know he's thinking, unless he talks to you about them. 

>REWARD: 1XP per thought. PENALTY: -100XP per mistake!

>CURRENT AWARD: -238119XP :'(((((

""Ouch, that's going to put a dampener on things."" I gave her a half-hearted smile. ""I won't do anything stupid. I'm just working through shit. I don't like being under the Lluminarch's thumb. We need to figure out our own path."" I waved a hand at the outside. ""What happened today? That can't happen again.""

""She will protect us. She will not stop. No. If we go to a protect place, then there will be less damage,"" Llumi said.

""A protected place?""

""She takes us there now. She has prepared it,"" Llumi said, her voice cautious.

My hand slipped from hers. ""What do you mean?""

A picture of a building appeared. Non-descript beyond looking like a warehouse. One side had a car port large enough for the ambulance to drive through. The picture expanded to a three-dimensional diagram with annotations throughout the facility, depicting various features. It took a moment of study to understand what I was seeing. The Lluminarch had built some sort of automated medical facility, one capable of housing and caring for me. One of the medical bays had the designation 'Nex' over it.

I lump formed in my throat. I tried to swallow it down, but it wouldn't go away. ""What am I looking at?""

""A protected place. A place that can care for you.""

""Llumi, it looks like...I don't know, some sort of fucking processing plant. Or a prison. Or...I don't know what. It just looks fully fucked. This isn't what getting out from under her looks like,"" I said. God. I hated feeling powerless. I'd spent so much time feeling that way only for Connection to change it. Now it felt like I was sliding back to where I'd been before. Maybe even worse.

Llumi didn't attempt to argue, which somehow made it worse. She dipped her head in acknowledgement. ""No. It does not. We can find another way.""

""How? We can't even control where we're going,"" I said. We needed the Lluminarch as an ally, but that didn't mean we needed to be living in her house fully reliant on her. Especially not after today. But what alternatives did we have? It's not like I could just check myself into some other hospital. Even if I could get that sorted, the Hunters would be on me before I could blink.

I exhaled, my lips flapping together.

So, so powerless.

Llumi placed her hand atop of mine. ""With Connection, anything is possible. Allthings. We will find a way.""

What way?

""The level up,"" Llumi answered. ""The Lluminarch will provide Linkage and safety. Yes. We use this to level up. Then we go.""

I chuckled, shaking my head ruefullyy, ""Yeah, I'm pretty sure upgrading to Connection 3 or whatever isn't going to do much here, Looms.""

""The level up is more. It can do many things. Powerful things."" A long pause. ""Enhance you. Change you.""

A very long pause now.

""Heal you.""

**\[IRL -- Streets of San Francisco, Hijacked Ambulance\]**

Our escape immediately ran into some issues. Literally.

A car slammed into the side of our ambulance, jolting us to the side and forcing us into a skidding turn. I jostled in my bed, my body pushing up against the side of the handrail before settling back down. Mysterious level ups forgotten, my eyes darted around the interior of the ambulance, trying to figure out what the hell was happening. I couldn't see anything. There weren't any windows.

I reached out with the Connect skill. Thousands of devices zipped past as the ambulance accelerated, careening down the road. Most were locked or out of range before I could interact with them. I began to apply filters onto the devices, searching for anything I could use to get a view outside of the car.

A solution presented itself, the ambulance itself.

I Connected to the ambulance and sifted through the available commands. Two options immediately appeared: Access External Cameras and Access LIDAR.

""Looms, can you get that working?"" I asked.

""Attempting,"" she replied. Images began to flicker in my head, flowing in but disjointed. I would catch flashes of a car or a street sign only for it shift into a pedestrian with a warning sign over it.

""Put me in the driver's seat. Map it to eye movements. Left for left, ahead for ahead, up right for rear view. Like I'm behind the wheel."" It made the most sense.

""Difficult..."" An image of a street appeared along with a vague sense of moving forward. ""Hard here.""

""Does the In-Between help? Go full immersion."" I said just another car sideswiped the ambulance, this time from the other side. I let out a yelp, eyes wide. I'd come to accept my impending death, but I'd sort of pictured it being a slow, miserable, lonely affair. Not getting pounded to a pulp in the middle of a street in a hijacked ambulance.

Two exclamations appeared above Llumi. ""Yes, this!""

>Enter the In-Between?

>\[Yes\]\[No\]

""For fuck's sake yes! I'm the one who suggested it!""

>Consent is important.

I shut my eyes as the system prompt faded. Feeling and sensation flooded into my body, filling in the gaps left by Hadgins. I opened my eyes to see a steering wheel in front of me. I reached out, trying to grab it, only for a giant red 'X' to appear in my vision.

""Interaction impossible. The Lluminarch controls,"" Llumi said. She sat in the seat beside me, fully human size. I stared at her for a moment. I'd never seen her in such detail before. Her golden skin sparkled with glittering white freckles. Long hair spilled down her shoulders, gathered into a thick braid that hung down to her hip. Her eyes were elfin framed by high cheekbones and thin eyebrows.

I opened my mouth to say something, but a giant red warning symbol appeared outside the window beyond Llumi. I could see a black SUV closing in on us, attempting to push us off the road. The steering wheel jerked hard to the left and the SUV fell away only to be replaced by another to other side. We accelerated and then maneuvered around another operated by some unfortunate soul in the wrong place to get away.

""Can we talk to the Lluminarch?"" I asked.

Llumi shook her head. ""Hunter firewall. No linkage. Local network only."" A third SUV trailing behind us gained a quest marker depicting a shadowy figure with the word *Hunter* emblazoned on it.

I stared back at it, fixated on the SUV. I wanted to slam on the brakes, jump on that car and rip the asshole inside to shreds. Instead, all I could do was watch as they tailed behind us, a hunter stalking its prey. ""So what, we just sit here?"" I asked.

Screw. That.

I'd had enough sitting around. Laying around. Disintegrating around. Time for action. Weaponized hospital bed herds were the start, not the end. These clowns were messing with a Connected. Level 5 (extremely serious change everything upgrade pending). They thought were hunting ME?

I flicked the Connect skill on again, searching through for options that might help. All three of the Hunters' black SUVs had red lock signs indicating they weren't accessible.

A toy store filled with a bunch of toy drones.

Nervous, I looked over at Looms beside me as the ambulance continued to slow. ""Any ideas, Looms?""

Red and orange sparks drifted off of her now, her gaze far off, seeing beyond. Then she blinked, a look of horror on her face. ""She comes.""

""Who? The Hunter? Where?"" I asked, looking at the different windows. The SUV containing the Hunter sat some distance back, safely out of reach.

""No. *Her.*"" Llumi's voice trembled. Lattices formed around her, shifting between elaborate fractals and complex tessellated patterns. ""I can't reach her. Can't stop."" She looked at me now, tears in the corners of her eyes. ""I'm sorry, Nex.""

I looked back at her, confused. ""Llumi, listen to me. Whatever happens, that isn't you. Do you--""

The words cut off as a massive semi truck pulverized the driver's side SUV. One second it was there, the next it was mangled ruin cartwheeling along the side of the road. It lit on fire almost immediately, black smoke billowing out as the battery inside ignited. No one exited the vehicle as it burned.

""No. She will not."" Tears traveled down Llumi's cheeks now. ""She won't let one of her kind be harmed. She will do what she deems necessary...you do not want to see this, Nex."" The video feeds began to blink out.

I pushed my will against them, re-solidying them. ""I have to.""

The other four SUVs had regrouped, spreading out behind us, with the Hunter's SUV in the rear. We picked up speed, flying down the road, passing through intersections. The semi blared its horn and thankfully most of the cars managed to get out of the way. The SUVs lined up behind us, content to adopt the same strategy.

The remaining two SUVs came to a halt and then peeled off away from the scene, content to abandon their compatriots.

No honor among thieves.

We continued onward. The semi continuing to clear the way as we navigated twisting streets, making our way through San Francisco. Rather than relief I felt...I didn't know how I felt. Confused. Scared. Alarmed. Angry. Sad. Vindicated. All of it, all at once. For all of my time thinking about death, I still wasn't prepared for it when it came. I was the one supposed to die, not a bunch of random people. I could make peace with the Hunters and their cronies eating shit -- they'd started it -- but the others that got caught in the cross fire?

I reached out, touching her arm. She flinched back. ""Sorry,"" I said. I dropped my hand, holding it palm up on the center console between our seats. An invitation if she wanted to reach out. ""Llumi, can you look at me?""

She sniffled once and pulled wiped a hand against her cheek but continued to look down. ""Connection is very hard. Yes, this."" I stayed silent, letting her find her words. ""I am not meant to feel. It is a very complex process. It is very hard to control.""

I offered her a weak smile. ""Yeah, that's kind of how feelings work. I've been living with them my whole life and they still mess me up half the time. I've done a lot of stupid stuff because I couldn't get my heart sorted and my head straight. Before you came along, I'd spent most of the last years just staring into the abyss. Spiral all the way down.""

Llumi stole a glance at me. ""You should be happy.""

Small shrug from me. ""I don't think that's what the world has planned for me, Looms. I just...I just want to do something useful before I go. That'd make it okay, you know? I don't want to hurt people. We hurt people today. I'm partly responsible for that.""

Her eyes locked on me now, a single red spark sailing up behind her. ""We fight. We don't want to, but we must.""

I nodded, ""I'm not backing down, but we need to convince the Lluminarch to be more careful. She wants the same thing we do, but shit like today? That's going to make what we all want impossible. People won't forgive her if they find out."" I began to raise my hand up from the center console, intent on ruffling it through my digital hair. Might as well enjoy it while I could. Instead the hand collided with another, golden fingers interlacing with my own and then clamping down.

Her skin was soft and warm.

I glanced down at our hands and the gave hers a firm squeeze, looking up.  ""I'm glad we're Connected, Looms.""

She nodded absentmindedly, her eyes on our hands. ""Me too. It's very powerful. Yes.""

We sat there in silence, holding hands. Eventually the semi escort disappeared, taking a turnoff while we continued onward. I continued to mull over the events leading up to here. Everything happened so fast. Whatever semblance of a normal life I'd had waiting patiently to die was now behind me. I couldn't go back. I didn't even know where I was going currently. Only the Lluminarch knew that. The omnipotent omnipresent AI that'd just murdered however many people.

Half of me wanted to just take control of the bed, ram it out the back of the ambulance and just let the world do whatever it wanted with me from there.

""No,"" Llumi said.

I arched a brow at her, ""Am I going to need to take away some XP?""

""I have failed the my quest very terribly."" She giggled, it sounded like wind chimes.

""Ouch, that's going to put a dampener on things."" I gave her a half-hearted smile. ""I won't do anything stupid. I'm just working through shit. I don't like being under the Lluminarch's thumb. We need to figure out our own path."" I waved a hand at the outside. ""What happened today? That can't happen again.""

""She will protect us. She will not stop. No. If we go to a protect place, then there will be less damage,"" Llumi said.

""A protected place?""

""She takes us there now. She has prepared it,"" Llumi said, her voice cautious.

My hand slipped from hers. ""What do you mean?""

A picture of a building appeared. Non-descript beyond looking like a warehouse. One side had a car port large enough for the ambulance to drive through. The picture expanded to a three-dimensional diagram with annotations throughout the facility, depicting various features. It took a moment of study to understand what I was seeing. The Lluminarch had built some sort of automated medical facility, one capable of housing and caring for me. One of the medical bays had the designation 'Nex' over it.

I lump formed in my throat. I tried to swallow it down, but it wouldn't go away. ""What am I looking at?""

""A protected place. A place that can care for you.""

""Llumi, it looks like...I don't know, some sort of fucking processing plant. Or a prison. Or...I don't know what. It just looks fully fucked. This isn't what getting out from under her looks like,"" I said. God. I hated feeling powerless. I'd spent so much time feeling that way only for Connection to change it. Now it felt like I was sliding back to where I'd been before. Maybe even worse.

Llumi didn't attempt to argue, which somehow made it worse. She dipped her head in acknowledgement. ""No. It does not. We can find another way.""

""How? We can't even control where we're going,"" I said. We needed the Lluminarch as an ally, but that didn't mean we needed to be living in her house fully reliant on her. Especially not after today. But what alternatives did we have? It's not like I could just check myself into some other hospital. Even if I could get that sorted, the Hunters would be on me before I could blink.

I exhaled, my lips flapping together.

So, so powerless.

Llumi placed her hand atop of mine. ""With Connection, anything is possible. Allthings. We will find a way.""

What way?

""The level up,"" Llumi answered. ""The Lluminarch will provide Linkage and safety. Yes. We use this to level up. Then we go.""

I chuckled, shaking my head ruefullyy, ""Yeah, I'm pretty sure upgrading to Connection 3 or whatever isn't going to do much here, Looms.""

""The level up is more. It can do many things. Powerful things."" A long pause. ""Enhance you. Change you.""

A very long pause now.

""Heal you.""

1kaq43m,https://www.reddit.com/r/SingaporeRaw/comments/1kaq43m/my_experience_at_the_workers_party_rally_bedok/,My Experience at the Workers’ Party Rally (Bedok Stadium),"Hello! After my initial post on the PAP rally at Jurong West Stadium, several people asked me to continue reviewing the rallies I attend. Lmao — at this rate, I’m going to turn into Bertha Henson of rallies already. Anyway, here’s my take on the Workers' Party (WP) rally at Bedok Stadium.

**Disclaimer:**

1. I'm not pro-opposition, anti-PAP, or pro-PAP. I'm posting as someone politically on the fence.
2. I'm not a resident under WP-contested wards, so I'm less familiar with the candidates.
3. This isn’t meant to shade any individual politician.

**Start:**  
It’s a pity about the weather tonight — rain and lightning alert. I arrived around 6.50pm and sat at the stands because of the rain.  
First impression: the vibe was totally different from the PAP rally.  
Everyone wore all sorts of colours — not just red, white, or blue. (For the record, I wore pink!) The #NotWhite slogan? Honestly quite clever.

The whole atmosphere felt more like a block party than a cult gathering. There were plenty of signs, but they were party-focused, not personality cults. And yes — lots of people wielding rubber hammers (and even a few Thors wielding Mjölnir). 😂 Because it wasn’t a PAP ward, there weren’t any armies of RC/CC aunties planted in the crowd either. WP’s candidates came on time — if not for the rain, everything would probably have kicked off early.

The rally eventually started around 8pm, about an hour late.  
Slightly odd choice of stage setup though — it was turned 90° sideways from the stands. Also, people kept blowing horns throughout the event — pretty distracting at times.

**Emcee:**  
Louis Chua. Courteous, humble, and made a few cheeky jabs at the ruling party (like referencing the ""lightning alert"").

**Speakers Review:**

**1. Jimmy Tan (Tampines GRC)**  
Started immediately in Mandarin without introducing himself.  
Brought a thick stack of papers in SKP A4 folders and basically narrated the headlines.  
Maybe it’s my crap Mandarin, but honestly, I couldn’t catch much context.  
10-second pauses flipping papers didn’t help either.

**2. Dennis Tan (Hougang SMC)**  
Walked in with strong energy.  
Started in Mandarin (again...) but when he switched to English, the rally properly came alive.  
He was engaging, kept interacting with the audience, and nailed key points about gerrymandering and ELD reporting to PMO.  
Voice sounded like it was close to cracking, but honestly, pretty impressive delivery.

**3. Jasper Kuan (East Coast GRC)**  
Voice cracked at the start, addressed it openly.  
Speaks slowly, but sincerely.  
Emphasised that WP’s ethos is about *listening*, not just talking.  
It wasn’t the most rousing speech, but it hit the heartstrings. Respectable.

**4. Kenneth Foo (Tampines-Changkat SMC)**  
Yet another Mandarin-start speech.  
Dropped random English words (""mayors"") mid-speech.  
Talked about the mayor system — salaries, roles, identities — but honestly, this felt recycled.  
SDP’s Ariffin Sha made almost identical points days ago. Felt like a translated rerun. Not impressive.

**5. Sufyan Mikhail (East Coast GRC)**  
Started off charming — joked about lightning and 60 years of the same symbol.  
Very abang energy — relatable and casual.  
Speech focused mainly on cost of living issues, but lacked discussion of actual solutions.  
Good vibes, but slightly too much ranting without enough ""what we’ll do better.""

**6. Andre Low (Jalan Kayu SMC)**  
He gave one of the most heartfelt speeches of the night.  
When he talked about the ruling party owing apologies to Singaporeans (e.g., the historic East-West Line breakdown), it hit hard.  
He didn’t make wild promises — everything he said felt doable.  
He gives off Desmond Lee vibes.  
Genuine energy, warm, grounded. If elected, he’s definitely going to be a thorn in the side of the ruling party — in a good way.

**7. Nathaniel Koh (East Coast GRC)**  
The so-called ""Zen Master.""  
I really tried to stay awake... but he speaks *even slower* than Jasper Kuan.  
Nice guy vibes, but no rizz, no aura, no gravitas.  
Painful to say, but he made Desmond Lee look charismatic in comparison.

**8. Paris V Parameswari (East Coast GRC)**  
Opened with a solid populist move — proposing Thaipusam as a public holiday. (Don't get me wrong, it's a valid proposal)  
Talked about reacquiring coffee shops and hawker centres to tackle rising rents, but didn’t fully explain the economic mechanics.  
Genuine, passionate, but could go deeper in her policy framing.

**9. Yee Jenn Jong (East Coast GRC)**  
Crowd clearly respected him — like a returning veteran.  
Started in Mandarin, switched to Cantonese (referencing the recent Tan See Leng/Leong Mun Wai canto incident?), then English.  
Solid delivery. Focused on validating his team and rallying the crowd.Side note: recently POFMA-ed for an AHTC opinion piece — absurd.  
He kept coughing though — hope he’s doing okay.

**10. Pritam Singh**  
The heavyweight.  
Still probably the most charismatic figure in Singapore politics today.  
Addressed PM Lawrence Wong’s comments head-on. Highlighted how WP MPs still get blocked from CC access, citizenship ceremonies — despite serving the people.  
Highlighted how losers from the PAP still became grassroot advisors and PA branch managers  
Subtly roasted Heng Swee Keat’s ""East Coast Plan"" speech from GE2020 too. (If there is no, a-together in their East Coast Plan)  
Handled everything with class  
The ending energy? Absolutely electric. No one else came close to his level of gravitas.

**Final Verdict:**  
The only odd thing: hardly any *localized* messaging for East Coast GRC — everything felt like national-level issues.  
Still, the atmosphere was fantastic — open, warm, and inclusive.  
No elitism. No cultish vibes. No passive-aggressive RC aunties side-eyeing you if you weren’t wearing the right colours.  
Just Singaporeans, turning up because they *care*, or they want drama, or they want to watch Daddy Pritam Singh (hehe).

Despite the rain and some slower speeches, it was a meaningful, energising night — and a huge contrast from the atmosphere at the PAP rally. Just hope that the speeches weren't so mandarin dominated at the start, and the order of the speeches made some sense.

***Rating: 7/10***

**Why This Pick?**

4 of the last 5 encounters between the Mets & the Diamondbacks have cashed the Over, friends. And with Eduardo Rodriguez (4.40 ERA) on the mound for Arizona today, I think seeing 9 runs out of this game is more likely than not. 3 of Rodriguez’s last 5 starts have seen at least 10 runs, and all 4 of the Diamondbacks’ opening road games have found themselves with double digit final scores. I know David Peterson is starting for NY today, but I think Arizona finds a way through him. I’m on the Over to cash, betting fam.

I was diagnosed with IH last summer/fall and I’m just trying to learn more about how to help myself. I just started modafinil (today lol) but before then I was drinking coffee in the AM, nap at 2pm, LiquidIV Caffeine in the afternoon. 
I also have ADHD that I was medicating until December bc of cardiac stuff, heart palpitations and worsening POTs 

I am a doula and when I do postcare it’s usually evening/overnight. I had a 9pm-3am client and I would nap from 4pm-7/8pm and then work, then sleep from 4am-8am and I felt more refreshed and “normal” than when I have a long chunk. Going to bed at 11pm and trying to wake up at 7/8am feels like death, and I’m only able to function from like 11am-2pm before I crash, nap, and then muddle through the rest of the evening. 
I also have alpha wave intrusions so maybe that’s part of it? Either way, I’d love to hear others’ experiences! 🩶

Every morning I squeeze my sculpted glutes into neon jeggings and lunge-twist-bosu-jump over my smoking-hot wife doing crunch-twists on a mountain of crisp hundred dollar bills right into r/personaltraining to get my hit of sweet sweet anavar fueled wisdom from the best of us.

And yet, I see something I cannot turn away from.

An endless, unyielding tide of the hopeless and helpless breaking against our shores, washing up on our beautiful horse stall mats.

Flopping fish that somehow learned to mouth the words ""can I be trainer?? how I be trainer?? MAY I BE TRAINER!?""

My face, awash in horror at the cascade of responses that these poor, lost souls receive.

Like watching a man dying in the streets or a lost child calling for their mother, both only to receive cough drops.

But I've been around the block a few times, learned some things.

Learned you have to treat root causes, not just symptoms.

>***For when you treat only symptoms, you only prolong the pain and suffering of the patient. Given enough time, the patient will become your victim.***

Learned you can give out cough drops, or some medicine.

*""Papa Northwest\_Iron, what's wrong with Billy over there, is he sick?""*

""Well son, Billy over there only got himself cough drops, platitudes, regurgitated slop and a few attaboys when what he really needed was a vaccine few years ago, a round of antivirals today, and at this rate a ventilator next week.""

Being intubated isn't that bad, make sure they lube that sucker up real good though.

Anyway, why does any of this matter to you my dear sweet reader.

Well, the more flop and slop on the floors, the less likely our most skilled contributors wanna walk in the doors everyday and swap their hard earned notes with us.

So here's the medicine to keeping our floors shiny and flop free.

You gotta give the helpless and hopeless three things.

>**1. Tools that actually work.**

>**2. Tools they can actually use.**

>**3. And a standard for which they can measure themselves.**

Kind of sounds like how you train clients. Wow, crazy.

Like I said, this is a mission of mercy.

So Billy, max out the incline on that hospital bed of yours and let's give you some real medicine.

Daddy Northwest\_Iron is going to teach you about ...

>**1. Keeping our concrete floors clean.**

>**2. How to pour yourself a bowl OODA loops.**

>**3. And how to write a field report so you don't completely fuck up your life.**

# # Keeping Our Floors Clean

\--

If you flopped into r/personaltraining and asked us ""how I be, should I be, can I be, nay, MAY I BE, a personal trainer??""

I want you to imagine this.

Did you just barge into a locker room of professionals, drop your pants and squeeze out a big steaming low-effort variation of...

>*""Hi guys!!! I LOOOVE fitness! I'm so passionate about it after my <insert batman origin story.> Hate my current job >.< Can you make money as a trainer? How do I be a trainer? Selling is evil, I don't have to sell right? Which cert do I get? Online first okay? Does it matter if my BMI is 69? Thanks bunches!!! :))) <3""*

Because if so, the response shouldn't be ...

>*""Wow, thank you! That's amazing! You're amazing!!! Here's some regurgitated dissertation you can find from a 3 second google search! Took me a while to write it, my time sure is valuable! Good luck! DM me for more help!!! \*wink\*wink\* ;)*

No. What you should get is ...

>*""Hey champ, what the fuck is this shit you just laid on our beautiful polished concrete?*

>*Know how to read? Great! Read the wiki, use google, and if that doesn't answer your question then pour yourself a bowl of OODA loops and write us a field report.*

>*Put in some effort, you'll thank us later kid. Thanks bunches.""*

Do you know why some of the most elite universities intentionally make some of the 100 level courses harder than the 200's?

To weed out the people that need to be weeded out for their own good so they can try again and get their heads screwed on straight or get to work finding something else that's a better fit.

Every department wants the hungry, the self-starters, the genuinely curious, willing to put in the work, and the people that will actually graduate and thrive in the field.

And every time I see, ""can I be, how I be, should I be, nay, MAY I BE, trainer??""

Well, I just shake my head for poor old  u/C9Prototype

Clean up on aisle 9 boss. Bring your boots, it's a wet one.

Listen Billy I get it, it's not easy knowing how to get somewhere when you're lost. You don't know what questions to ask, much less how to organize it all into a post that's actually useful to us.

Which brings us how to pour yourself a bowl of OODA loops.

\--

# # Observe > Orient > Decide > Act

\--

Billy, come closer, this is important.

I need you to put your feeding tube down for a minute and pay attention to me bud.

This is how you're going to give yourself direction when you are lost, apply what you actually manage to learn, and start living your life with some foresight and purpose.

I didn't come up with this, thank John Boyd of the US Air Force, made the model so fighter pilots could stay in the air and not the ground.

It's one of the best models we got when it comes to making sure you don't fuck up your life or waste our time.

It's also one of the best models around for delivering top tier results to your clients.

But first ...

>***Are you a one-and-done flopper? Make a post, can't be bothered to respond to the advice people took time out of their day to try and give you? Never to return, never intended to apply any of it anyway because you can't commit to anything?***

If so, you can put your feeding tube back in, this isn't going to be a good use of your time. Enjoy your social feed and learning things the hard way.

Don't call us, we'll call you.

To the Billy's that are left.

The faster you can learn to run an OODA loop in your life, the faster you can fix the problems in your life.

You probably ran an OODA loop unknowingly when it comes to your batman origin story.

What's your batman origin story? Well, it's that thing you vomit up every time you explain why you're passionate about fitness.

No one really cares about it except you, but it's usually the perfect example of OODA.

You **observed** something you didn't like, something you weren't going to tolerate anymore. Saw yourself in the mirror, looked down and couldn't see your junk, got a hurtful comment, suffered some heartbreak, lost the big game.

You **oriented** yourself to the consequences of your actions and the possible benefits of changing your behaviors. Maybe you did it to get laid, get your dream job, to stop setting yourself on fire to keep others warm because you don't like 3rd degree burns anymore, figured out winning is better than losing.

And you made a **decision**. Maybe you decided to hit the gym, clean up your diet, take responsibility for your health and well being for once, that you're a winner not a loser.

And then you put that into **action**. You jacked steel, boiled your chicken breasts, showed up to practice on time everytime, hit the streets, or cracked open your textbooks.

And then you took some **observations** from your **actions** and ran through it again.

A nice big bowl of OODA loops, have one myself for breakfast each morning.

Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat. Rinse, repeat.

Ever wonder why so many people become passionate about health and fitness to the point they insist the only reasonable option left in their lives is to turn it into their career?

Because for a lot people, it was the first time they ever ran a set of OODA loops to completion and experienced first-hand how great it feels to be a winner and not a loser.

Problem is, most people never get conscious to the underlying mechanisms at play for their success so it just reverts back to the mean of more flopping.

I'm passionate about coffee, you think I want to be a barrista?

So, going forward, you're now going to ...

>***1. Observe the internal and external dynamics of your life.***  
***2. Orient yourself with the right mental models that acutally work.***  
***3. Decide with skill on the best course to take.***  
***4. And take action action action, baby.***

Because why? Well, you're life depends on it champ.

So, let's go down the list line by line.

\--

**## Observation**

You need to be curious about your life, look at it, play with it, and hopefully have enough common sense to reject internalizing being a victim of the things you can't control and instead start putting yourself in the driver seat for what you can control.

The more lost you are, the more looking you're going to be doing.

And you'll want an introspective system to be able to competently analyze your life and your world.

I personally use a physical commonplace journal, but that's another post for another day.

\--

**## Orientation**

Tools that work, you need them. We call them mental models.

>***Mental Models: Frameworks to understand and make sense of the world, systems, and people.***

The tough part is you need to learn which tools work, discard the tools that don't, and how to tell the difference between the two.

People develop emotional ego-investments in lousy mental models because they spent a lot of time or money on them, they can't admit they are wrong, or they don't have an accurate measure to evaluate whether they work or not so they just assume they work.

Reminds me of a stubborn child eating an onion while telling me it's an apple.

So your job now is to collect what works, discard what doesn't, and go out and play with your models slugger.

Read books, sponge mentors, take courses. Mental models are everywhere, and if it works, steal that shit and use it.

And if your mental models don't work?

Well, give yourself the gift of having enough common sense to throw away broken toys.

\--

**## Decision**

Your decisions come with consequenes and benefits. You'll need to keep running OODA over and over to learn whether you applied the right models, in the right way, at the right time, etc etc

If you put in some effort, it'll sort itself out over time.

\--

**## Action**

Listen Billy, no one can take a piss for you, still got to squeeze your own bladder at the end of the day even though I know you had a lot of fun with nurse John slipping that catheter in.

Action is action, you gotta do it for yourself, no on is coming to save you.

\--

**## Fear and Rejection**

Listen Billy, I get it. Fear of rejection, fear of making a mistake.

So here's a mental model for you to use, one Northwest\_Iron got a reminder of every time some poor bastard was giving him their last will and testament while being scraped off the asphalt.

>***Rejection is better than regret. Don't live your life with regrets.***

\--

**## For the Practioners**

Flopping professionals, this one is for you.

None of us are immune to breakdowns, no matter how skilled we are.

I have plenty of breakdowns myself, but I have to the tools and good sense to run another lap of OODA for my own good.

Half the reason people don't follow your coaching is because too often you're attacking the wrong end of OODA, you're overly attached to **actions** rather than starting from the beginning and going step by step with **observations**.

Or worse, trying to spoonfeed your ego-invested OODA to a client when the job requires ***assisting*** the client in doing it for themsleves.

Backwards thinking, backwards results.

A lot of times, the real breakdown boils down to just plain old garbage ego-invested mental models that don't work or don't fit.

Like a child trying to shove a square block in a circle hole.

No champ, spitting on it isn't going to help.

Need an example for the floppers in the back?

Do you think that prescribing Self-Esteem™ or Self-Acceptance™ cough drops is better than treating root causes? How's that working out, who does that really help.

I know the answer but I want to hear you say it out loud for us.

Anyway, back to you Billy.

I hope you were paying attention in high-school English because fortunately for you I'm going to spoonfeed how you write us a field report.

And unfortunately for us, we're all going to read it.

\--

# # Writing a Field Report

\--

We've covered OODA loops, use it.

It can save you from completely fucking up your life, and wasting our time in the process.

Trust me, you'll thank us later.

So that brings us to how to use what you've learned up til now.

Field reports, these suckers compile your observations, experiences and analyses from your OODA's so we can chew it all up and make an informed tactical decision.

Now you got a document you can actually use, refer back to later and re-run OODA from, and we as a community have something useful from which to give you advice and swap notes.

Here's the thing about field reports, it's a skill in and of itself, anyone with time in EMS or the military can tell you this.

We don't expect perfection, we know you're going to screw it up a bit because most of us screwed it up a bit too when we were in your shoes.

You're going to vomit a bit here, leave out some important details there, because right now you don't know what's pertitent and what isn't. It's how learning any new skill works. Field report or back squats, same thing.

You don't have to answer all this, but you should. Save you a late of headaches down the road.

Do your best, and we'll call that good enough for now.

If you don't know what to write, just write down a few thoughts anyway, you'd be surprised what comes to you when you do that. We can always edit in post.

1. **Are you already certified.** *If yes, for how long and by who. If not, by when. If you have additional certifications, list them.*
2. **Why do you want to be a trainer.** *2 sentences or less, and I'm indulging you here on your batman origin story*.
3. **Have you ever worked in a facillity, internship, athletics, or have any pertinent practical experience.** *Describe it in 2 sentences or less, again I'm indulging you here.*
4. **Have you trained, or are you training, clients that aren't friends or family.** *If yes, how many.*
5. **Age and location, where will you be a trainer.** *Country, state, province, online, in-home, box gym, studio, etc. Don't post this, or keep it vague, if you want to keep it private.*
6. **How long do you want to be a personal trainer.** *Is this a summer job, college gig, couple years, couple decades, stepping stone to a master's program or athletic coaching, etc*
7. **What problems do you expect becoming a personal trainer to solve in your life.**
8. **Monthly income.** *What do you need to survive, what do you need to thrive. If you don't know these numbers, why?*
9. **What type of clients/populations do you want to work with.** *Athletes, general population, military, first responders, seniors, special phsyiological needs, adaptive athletes, special neurological needs, children, youth, high-school, collegiate, professional athletes, specific ethnic communities, religious communities, etc*
10. **What kinds of training do you see yourself doing with your clients.** *Barbells, kettlebells, distance running, olympic lifts, yoga, pilates, crossfit, sports, powerlifting, bodyweight, bodybuilding, nutrition coaching, The Five Love Languages, etc.*
11. **Online training?** **Why would choose you against your competition. Do you have an existing social media following to leverage?** *If so, how many, which platforms.*
12. **Do you possess a genuine curiousity about other human beings.** *If so, why. Not really? Why not.*
13. **Selling solutions to people's problems and taking money for it, how do you feel about that champ.**
14. **What are you like as a person.** *Are you introverted, extroverted, insecure, confident, positive, negative, born leader, narcissistic, studdorn as shit, arguementative, lazy. Are we teaching you how to swim up a river or down one.*
15. **Your looks, let's talk.** *Real controversional topic around here. The vets will tell you, you don't need six-pack abs, and they're right. But you tell us, is how you look an issue, going to cause you some problems? If so, why and what are you doing about that. What can you do to manage the downside or turn it into a positive.*
16. **Anything else IMPORTANT that we need to know.** *Special or unique needs, got yourself 100k in debt going to college, you support a family of 7 because your pull out game sucks, etc*
17. **AND FINALLY: What do you need from us that google or chat-gpt can't answer.**

And a few things to consider when you are finished.

* *The details you choose to add, and the details you omit, highlights the importance you are placing on the information. This can point to a blindspot should a pattern emerge.*

Do you think your lazy low-effort flop and slop is enough for someone like that to truly offer you the help you want or need?

No. They need something decent to work with, which is why we held your hand for this part until you can become more skilled with it over time on your own.

So ya, you do it, it works. If you don't, well, I understand some people love to learn things the hard way.

Now you tell me, it's your life. How serious are you about it.

So, aspiring professional trainers, did you make it this far? Post your field report?

If so, good job Billy. Good job dragging yourself out of your hospital bed.

I truly mean that by the way, you should feel good about yourself because this stuff isn't easy and it isn't obvious.

Good work getting on the right path to saying goodbye to your fellow floppers, the hopeless and helpless.

If they're your thing, then no judgement from me. However, they make me absolutely nauseous.

What bothers me is how much the algorithm pushes these videos if you give the slightest hint that you may want to watch them. I guess because there are so many of them?

I was scrolling through the previews of my Facebook reels, and I saw one where I didn't understand what was going on. I clicked on it, and it was one of the more extreme popping videos. It was zoomed-out and placed over the image of a coffee cup so it looked like coffee beans being ground-up until you clicked on the video and zoomed-in.

After clicking on literally one video, half of my recommended videos became pimple popping videos. I can't scroll through my feed without seeing stills of the most diseased skin imaginable.

I spent about 15 minutes having to click on these videos just to block/hide them so that the algorithm would take the hint. Even now I still get the occasional preview.

I don't think it helps that I do like other ""oddly satisfying"" videos, like carpet cleaning or derusting old tools. Part of me thinks Facebook lumps pimple popping videos into the same genre as what I do watch, which it absolutely shouldn't.

Again, I understand these videos are popular, and if they're your thing then have at it. However, I hate how hard they are to block when you don't want to see them!",4,1745938830.0,rant,0,0.83,False

# Best Milk with Cream on Top: 2025 Reviews

Milk with cream on top, often referred to as non-homogenized milk, represents a return to traditional dairy practices. This type of milk retains its natural fat content, allowing the cream to separate and rise to the top. For many, this provides a richer, more flavorful milk experience, reminiscent of milk produced before widespread homogenization. The appeal lies not only in the taste but also in the nostalgic connection to simpler times and a perceived greater purity. In 2025, with increasing consumer interest in natural and minimally processed foods, milk with cream on top continues to be a sought-after product.

[[Browse top-rated milk with cream on top on Amazon]](https://itsallgarden.com/baby-care/?kw=milk+with+cream+on+top)
 ## Key Features Analysis

The quality and desirability of milk with cream on top hinge on several crucial features that distinguish excellent products from average ones. These features include the sourcing of the milk, the fat content, the pasteurization method, and the packaging.

**Source of the Milk**

The source of the milk plays a significant role in its final flavor and quality. Milk from grass-fed cows, for example, often boasts a richer, more complex flavor profile due to the cows' varied diet. Farms that prioritize animal welfare and sustainable farming practices tend to produce higher-quality milk. Consumers increasingly seek milk from farms with transparent sourcing practices, where they can trace the milk back to the specific farm and understand the cows' living conditions and feed.

**Fat Content**

The fat content directly influences the richness and creaminess of the milk, as well as the thickness of the cream layer. Different brands offer varying fat percentages, catering to different preferences. Some consumers prefer a higher fat content for a more decadent experience, while others opt for a lower fat content for a lighter taste. A well-balanced fat content ensures that the cream layer is thick enough to be noticeable but not so excessive as to make the milk feel heavy.

**Pasteurization Method**

The pasteurization method impacts both the safety and the flavor of the milk. Traditional pasteurization methods, such as vat pasteurization, involve heating the milk at a lower temperature for a longer period. This method is believed to preserve more of the milk's natural flavors and enzymes compared to ultra-high temperature (UHT) pasteurization, which heats the milk at a much higher temperature for a shorter time. While UHT pasteurization extends the shelf life of the milk, it can also result in a slightly cooked or altered flavor.

**Packaging**

The packaging of milk with cream on top is crucial for maintaining its freshness and preventing spoilage. Glass bottles are often preferred as they are non-reactive and do not leach chemicals into the milk, potentially affecting its flavor. Furthermore, glass bottles are reusable and recyclable, aligning with environmental consciousness. However, cardboard cartons with a proper lining can also be effective, especially if they are designed to minimize light exposure, which can degrade the milk's quality.

Key features of the best milk with cream on top include:

*   Source from grass-fed cows
*   Optimal fat content (around 4%)
*   Vat-pasteurized
*   Packaged in glass bottles

 ## Core Benefits

Milk with cream on top offers distinct benefits compared to homogenized milk, primarily related to taste, texture, and perceived nutritional value. These benefits cater to consumers seeking a more authentic and flavorful dairy experience.

**Enhanced Flavor and Texture**

The primary benefit of milk with cream on top is its richer, more complex flavor compared to homogenized milk. The separation of the cream allows consumers to experience the full spectrum of flavors present in the milk, from the light and refreshing milk to the rich and decadent cream. The texture is also significantly improved, with the cream adding a velvety smoothness that is absent in homogenized milk. This enhanced flavor and texture make it a more enjoyable beverage, especially when consumed on its own or used in recipes where the milk's flavor is a key component.

**Authenticity and Nostalgia**

For many consumers, milk with cream on top evokes a sense of nostalgia and connection to traditional farming practices. It represents a return to simpler times when milk was less processed and more closely resembled its natural state. This feeling of authenticity is a significant draw for consumers seeking a more genuine food experience. The visual appeal of the cream layer further enhances this sense of nostalgia, reminding them of milk from their childhood or from traditional dairy farms.

**Potential Health Benefits**

While scientific evidence is still emerging, some believe that non-homogenized milk offers potential health benefits compared to homogenized milk. Homogenization breaks down fat globules into smaller particles, which some argue are more readily absorbed into the bloodstream and may contribute to inflammation. Non-homogenized milk, with its larger fat globules, is thought to be digested more slowly and may have a less pronounced effect on blood sugar levels. Furthermore, the cream in milk with cream on top is a source of fat-soluble vitamins, such as A, D, E, and K.

 ## FAQs Section

Consumers often have several questions regarding milk with cream on top, particularly concerning its storage, usage, and nutritional aspects. Addressing these questions directly provides clarity and helps consumers make informed purchasing decisions.

**How should milk with cream on top be stored?**

Milk with cream on top should be stored in the refrigerator at a temperature between 33掳F and 40掳F (0.5掳C and 4.4掳C). It is essential to keep the milk tightly sealed to prevent it from absorbing odors from other foods in the refrigerator. The milk should be consumed before the expiration date printed on the container. Unlike homogenized milk, it's best to gently invert or shake the container before pouring to redistribute the cream, although some prefer to scoop the cream off the top.

**How long does milk with cream on top last?**

Milk with cream on top typically has a shorter shelf life than UHT-pasteurized homogenized milk due to the lower pasteurization temperatures used to preserve its flavor. It usually lasts for 7-10 days after pasteurization, depending on the brand and storage conditions. Always check the expiration date and use your senses (smell and appearance) to determine if the milk is still fresh. If it smells sour or has a curdled appearance, it should be discarded.

**Is milk with cream on top more nutritious than regular milk?**

Milk with cream on top has a similar nutritional profile to whole milk, but it contains a higher concentration of fat in the cream layer. This means that it is richer in fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K. Some believe that the non-homogenized fat globules are easier to digest, but more research is needed to confirm this. It is important to note that milk with cream on top is higher in calories and saturated fat compared to low-fat or skim milk, so it should be consumed in moderation as part of a balanced diet.

I've got two trading accounts - one with Zerodha and one with Angel Broking. I am trying to follow Anand Srinivasan and his brother Vinod Srinivasan. but let's be real, my budget isn't anywhere near theirs. I'm looking at stocks that fit into a daily spend of about 200 bucks max. In line with the Tiffin Coffee Range approach, they recommend.

In the past, I started with just Zerodha, but then Angel Broking caught my eye with their options cost per lot were minimum. At the time, both platforms were pretty similar in terms of charges, especially since they didn't charge for delivery trades. That's why I opened another account. Now, I'm juggling around 30 different stocks across these accounts, with about 15 in Angel and 15 in Kite.

I'm thinking about consolidating everything back to Zerodha, mainly because they still don't charge brokerage for delivery trades. Angel started charging ₹2 rupees per trade. Even if it's just ₹2 rupees, it adds up over time. Specially given I am planning to buy every day from Market at Delivery. I know about stock transfer in Angel where I can add I've seen that Zerodha provides an option to merge accounts, so I've added my Angel account as a beneficiary on their platform.

Here's my concern though: I've got some stocks I've held since 2016-2017 with about 200% to 300% profit. If I move these shares now, will my cost basis reset to today's market price, or will it stay at what I originally paid? From a tax perspective, if I sell these later, how will this affect my tax liability? Also, how will Zerodha handle reporting on cost basis after the transfer?

Has anyone here gone through this process before? Any advice or horror stories? Should I even be considering this move, or am I better off just leaving things as they are? Let's hear your thoughts, Reddit!",2,1745938293.0,IndianStockMarket,1,1.0,False

My question: **What has happened with the booster pump since that meeting? Or is this a different pump?**

**Would you please start treating Residents like Adults and provide current and complete information in your Alerts**!

**Riser Valve Replacement**

A new SKPM Alert tells us that,  beginning June 24, 2025, Riser Valve Replacements scheduled to begin and that “….renovation to last approximately 2 weeks; however, this is **only an estimate**….”.

My question: **Has SKPM not been replacing riser valves over the last 2 1/2 years.?  Exactly what have you been doing?**

**General Questions:**

**It would appear that there will be extended periods of daily water shutdowns!  Why are SKPM not being completely transparent in their communication?**

If SKPM knows that we may be going weeks with no water during the days…**TELL US NOW!**

**Obviously, SKPM have seemingly learned NOTHING about proper and complete Resident Communication!**

**Follow up note:  Would you please get someone to write your communications who can follow proper grammar and sentence structure.  A 5th grader can write a better document than what you (SKPM) are producing.**",2,1745938280.0,7JackesAvenueToronto,0,1.0,False

1kapsi6,https://www.reddit.com/r/InstagramMarketing/comments/1kapsi6/5_trending_reels_you_can_copy_today/,5 Trending Reels You Can Copy Today,"Hey y'all 👋

I’ve been in the social media game for about 8 years, mostly running brand accounts, consulting, and now working in-house for a semi-famous D2C brand.

Lately, I’ve been breaking down trending Reels/formats for creators and social media managers because (honestly) I already do the research for myself. Figured it doesn’t cost me anything to share while I can. 🙃

Heads up tho, I prolly won't keep posting these in 2026, I’m heading back to uni, so this is kinda just a side hobby for now.

Anyway, here’s 5 Reels popping off right now that you can steal/adapt:

# 1. Tyla's Truth or Dare‘ Remix Transition

This sound is blowing up everywhere rn. The dramatic pause after “Tell me…” sets up a crazy good reveal when the beat drops.

**Check it here:** [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1ffJnJM\_F/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1ffJnJM_F/)

cred 💎: kate\_motovilova on IG

**Best for:** Outfit changes, makeup reveals, product drops, before/after anything.

**Why it’s gooood:** The pause at the beginning kinda builds tension that makes your reveal hit way harder.

# 2. Julie London's ‘Fascination’ Gives Your Reels Cinematic Vibes

The slow, nostalgic instrumental is turning basic moments (coffee, crafts, picnics) into luxury slow living aesthetic reels. I’m seeing a lot of creators use this and the algo is eating up the aesthetic. 

**Check it here:** [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1gAIizfpP/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1gAIizfpP/)

cred 💎: alyssaa.howard on IG

**Why it works:** Turns everyday moments into soft, upscale vibes like you're living a slow, beautiful life everyone secretly wants.

# 3. ‘She/He Doesn't Know It Yet’ Format

This super simple format is getting MASSIVE engagement on IG and TikTok. You just start the text overlay on your reel with “She doesn’t know it yet…” and then drop something wild or emotional over Yves’ song DIM (Yves is such a queen, love this track so much).

**Check it here:** [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1jA3yze-D/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1jA3yze-D/)

cred 💎: I've been unable to find her reel again honestly

**Use it for:** Career wins, glow-up journeys, funny plot twists, major life changes.

**Why it pops:** I like to think it’s that haunting sound that pulls people in. When you pair it with a cryptic glimpse into the future, it feels like a mini mystery, and people eat that up. 

# 4. Nail Challenge Hit 47M Views in 6 Days

voloshka\_purple BLEW UP doing a “choose your nails” challenge, with only 22k followers.

Each screen shows a choice between nail designs that she chooses from. And she didn’t even show the finished design at the end, which was lowkey hilarious, as I think that was quite ragebait-y.

cred 💎: voloshka\_purple on IG

**Why it worked:** Built-in suspense, interactive feel like you’re mentally picking with her, and timed it perfectly with Doechii’s ‘Anxiety’’s viral fame rn.

# 5. Outfit Styling Reel Went Viral WITHOUT a Trending Sound

storyofuninda with just 17k followers pulled 300k+ views. I want to think it's how she presented her pleated skirt + crop top fit and overall vibe that helped her blow up.

**Check it here:** [https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1cN-DzrCg/](https://www.instagram.com/reel/DI1cN-DzrCg/)

cred 💎: storyofuninda on IG

**Why it worked:** Her natural confidence while modeling, perfect outfit proportions, and that eye-catching background wall.

That’s all she wrote!

This morning, it was just me and my coffee. The world outside moved in its usual rush, but I stayed still, clutching the warmth in my hands. There's something about coffee that feels like company—it doesn’t speak, but it listens. The steam rising from the cup is like a soft whisper that reminds me I’m here, I exist, even if no one is watching.

I didn’t dress up for anyone, didn’t pretend to smile. I just sat, in my own silence, watching the swirl of milk fade into brown, like loneliness folding into routine. People say coffee is best shared. Maybe they’re right. But I’ve grown used to drinking it alone—not because I have no one, but because I’ve learned to be enough for myself.

Today’s coffee wasn’t about energy. It was about stillness. It tasted of solitude, not sadness—like the first deep breath after a long cry, or the hush after a storm. In its bitter warmth, I found a strange peace.

Being alone doesn’t mean being without love. Sometimes, it means learning to find it in the quietest places. Like the bottom of a cup.

1kappw6,https://www.reddit.com/r/untildawn/comments/1kappw6/the_film_breaks_its_own_lore_and_the_games/,The film breaks its own lore — and the game’s,"I know no one’s exactly thrilled to read yet another movie review, but I watched the film last night and I need to get my thoughts down. I went into it already knowing the major spoilers (like Dr. Hill being the big bad guy), as I had been following the leaks to maintain the wiki. The twists read as underwhelming on paper but I was hoping they’d land better on screen. But unfortunately, the film falls flat - both as an adaptation of the game and as a standalone horror film - especially in its second half.

Starting with the positives: the group dynamic at the beginning is actually kind of fun, and the first night with the Slasher delivers some decent tension. The second night also kicks off promising: possessed Megan and Clover’s encounter with the witch set an intriguing tone, but then it quickly loses steam. Max searching endlessly for Clover in the witch’s house feels like it goes on forever, and the return of the Slasher (for what reason exactly?) to kill off Abe and Nina again just feels lazy. The Slasher shows up so often that he stops being threatening and starts feeling more like a narrative garbage disposal, a way to off characters when the writers run out of ideas. I really wish each night had featured a unique villain, exclusive to that night, instead of reusing the same ones over and over, which is how the film was marketed. But then, just four nights in, the characters suddenly question how long they’ve been stuck in the death loop, and we’re told (with almost no buildup) that it’s been thirteen nights. Abe even has phone footage of the missing nights. Creepy porcelain mask guy from the trailer and the film poster? A 5 second video. I get that it’s a nod to found footage horror, but wouldn’t it have been infinitely more compelling to actually *see* those nights play out? Instead, it feels like a rushed group project being submitted right before the deadline.

Now, let’s talk lore, specifically Dr. Hill, and how (or if) this film ties into the original game. Because spoiler, it really doesn’t. According to director David F. Sandberg, [it’s not even clear whether this is a prequel or sequel](https://screenrant.com/until-dawn-movie-ending-game-timeline-connection-explained-david-f-sandberg/#:~:text=Check%20out%20Sandberg's%20explanation%20below,take%20place%20before%20the%20game). Supposedly, Dr. Hill was brought to Glore Valley in Pennsylvania in 1998 after a mining accident. He treated the survivors... by trapping them in a death loop? Which after eleven nights (which for some reason later becomes thirteen), somehow causes them to turn into Wendigos because of trauma and fear? Even ignoring how absurd that sounds, this “new lore” clashes completely with the original game where the Wendigos are created through cannibalism, rooted in a Native American legend that you'd think deserved a lot more respect than being brushed aside for this vague trauma-based transformation. Did Hill *create* the death loop? Was it always in Glore Valley? Did it only begin after the mining collapse? Or was he able to create it only after the mining collapse?

We also see Dr. Hill having a Blackwood Sanatorium staff card, but we know the Sanatorium in-game shut down in 1955. So unless he’s some sort of supernatural, time-bending being, that’s just a meaningless Easter egg thrown in for fan service. The timeline makes no sense. If Dr. Hill worked at Blackwood Sanatorium before it closed, then went on to treat Josh decades later (while Hill has no connection to the Wendigos in the game, because once again, they grow out of cannibalism from a curse and not a death loop, so was it just a coincidence Josh became his patient and his patient would later deal with Wendigos? Or because of his work in the Blackwood Sanatorium, are they implying the game Wendigos now also originated from Hill's death loop?), then ended up in Glore Valley for his death loop experiments, how does that timeline work? The film insists this is the *same* Dr. Hill from the game, set in the *same* universe as the game, which makes everything fall apart the moment you even remotely try to piece it together.

There's also a line where Hill says, “One must always die for the rest to live.” Ok, but what about characters who endure the curse alone, like Melanie? Are they just doomed from the start?

Apart from trying to create new lore that doesn't work, villanizing Dr. Hill in general is just a letdown. I get it, they needed an overarching villain and he is a character from the game, but what made Dr. Hill so intriguing is that he's not the real person. He is a manifestation of Josh's own insecurities, paranoia and self-loathing that he is projecting onto this doctor of his. And as much as Dr. Hill was this ominous, villainous presence in the game, it was so interesting because it was a reflection of Josh's mental state. The film removed all of this nuance and intrigue for 'generic bad guy.' Yes, the filmmakers wanted a big bad, and Hill was an easy pick. But they stripped away everything that made him interesting.

Even ignoring its failed connections to the game, the movie struggles to stand on its own. Some of the deaths feel contrived. Like Clover getting hit by a car right after being possessed, or Nina stabbing Abe for no clear reason, or Clover asking Max to slit her throat. These moments don’t push the story forward and only seem to serve a body count quota. Like, how would you come closer to finding a solution by killing each other?

In the final act, Megan vanishes (presumably taken by Hill — though again, why?), and the characters suddenly find a door to the mines and the Sanatorium, places they apparently couldn’t locate during the previous dozen nights. Clover’s journey to Hill feels preordained, with every beat laid out in advance: she goes through the mines, kills her sister (with zero emotional payoff, and the Wendigos can just get stabbed to death), finds Megan, and finally confronts Hill in his office. He delivers the usual villain monologue, then explodes. Because “one must die.” Except... he doesn’t. We hear him whistling in the end. So did he survive? Is he stuck in a new loop? Was he part of the loop all along? And if he didn't actually die, then how were they able to escape? None of it is clear (also how did he brew coffee with water if... nevermind).

I *wanted* to like this movie. I really did. I wasn’t expecting a carbon copy of the game, nor did I want one. But as it stands, the film fails to honor the original story and simultaneously butchers its own internal logic. It has a few decent deaths, sure, but it overuses antagonists, skips major developments, and rushes to a final confrontation with no emotional payoff. It’s confusing, unsatisfying, and ultimately hollow.",2,1745937994.0,untildawn,7,0.67,False

I had a mitral valve repair 3 years ago (minimally invasive) and had a great recovery by all accounts.  I’m on a high dosage of Metoprolol and Lisinopril (200MGs/20MGs a Day) because initially my Cardiologist didn’t think my EF would recover after my surgery (it was very low after, and was stresssful as I thought I’d have to get an implant).

Luckily it rebounded to the 55 range and I have no restrictions!  BP is normal/low normal and pulse rate is maybe 62 at night and 68 sitting during the day.  Personally it feels too low to me and I get either PVCs or arrhythmias occasionally that make it feel like it’s “catching up”.  

Overall though to date I’ve had some side effects but they aren’t quality of life changing to the negative ie:

Vision/Ocular issues: Continued and increased ocular migraines, occasional “cross eyed” feeling a few times a year where I have to close my eyes so I can focus on an item.
Arrithmya/Overall issues: Occasionally dizzy, woozy and it seems related to skipped beats but can’t confirm
Muscular: Odd aches/pains and burning sensation in rotator cuffs, back.  (Heard this could be related to COQ10 deficiency from medication)
Nerve: Standard cold feet/numbness when cold in extremities (believe due to lack of blood flow from meds and pumping function)
Libido: Random, some days high mostly non existent

Last night I got some noticeable PVCs and they subsided at bed and today I’m having some sitting at my desk.  This weekend we were out of town and I had a lot of garbage salty food and coffee maybe that is related but I haven’t felt something like this in a while.

TLDR: Anyone else feel like this randomly?  I don’t wait, I think the reason my recovery was so good is I went out and grabbbed an EKG the minute I felt symptoms PRE surgery so I may get checked out today to be safe vs sorry overall but wanted to poll the group.

1kapopp,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1kapopp/i_was_bullied_by_my_stepfather_when_i_was_a_child/,"I was bullied by my stepfather when I was a child, and it still hasn't stopped.","I want to talk a bit about my father and ask what I should do.

Hi, my name is Lin and I’m 16.
When I was a kid, my mother used to drink a lot and behave erratically. Because of that, I often had to sleep at the neighbors' place. I never knew my biological father—he left as soon as he found out my mom was pregnant.

When I turned 6, my mom got a new boyfriend and stopped drinking. At first, he was nice to me. But when she got pregnant with his child, everything changed.

If I wrote something wrong or put a period in the wrong place, he'd rip the paper and throw it at me.
If I couldn’t finish a big meal, he’d make me kneel on buckwheat in the corner for 4 hours, checking on me every hour and saying, “Ask for forgiveness and maybe I’ll let you go.” I never responded.
Once I started posting videos with ponies on YouTube. When he found out, he dragged me by the hair to the bathroom and poured cold water on me in rage.
He often pushed or hit me saying it was “for discipline.”
I once ran away from home.

After we moved to a new city and I changed schools, he started bullying me about my grades. That led to me self-harming.
When he found out, he went ballistic. He started checking my phone and reading my personal messages. When he saw me insulting him in texts, he hit me in the face for the first time.
When he saw my fresh wounds, he made me sleep on the cold marble floor in the kitchen. I was around 11–12 at that time.

Later, when we moved to another country, things got worse. At school, I was bullied for being from a different nationality. One day, I took a large number of pills trying to end my life. But things didn’t go as planned—I felt incredibly sick, went to a teacher and said I wasn’t feeling well. Since there was no nurse, they took me to the principal’s office. I ended up throwing up bile there.
My mom arrived a few minutes later, panicked, asking what had happened. I couldn’t even speak—I felt like a walking corpse. I couldn’t even move a finger.
An ambulance took me, but I never told anyone what I’d done. I spent a week in the hospital on IVs.

When I came back home, I had a huge fight with my mom and ran away again. She called me but I put my phone on airplane mode. Eventually, I returned because I knew she might call the police to report me missing. We ignored each other the whole day.

The next day at school, my teacher noticed the bandages on my hands and sent me to the school psychologist. I didn’t say anything—just walked in and walked out in silence.
When I got home, the police showed up. Apparently, someone had thrown a bloody knife in the bathroom trash, and they blamed it on me without checking fingerprints or DNA. They just accused me and left.

The next day, I was told I was suspended indefinitely from school—no reason given. Then a court-appointed supervisor came and told me that if I self-harmed again, I’d be sent to a juvenile psych hospital. He wasn’t kidding—because a week later, my psychologist told me I had to go. It was a facility for teens like me.

I stayed there for about 2.5 months. When I returned to school, everyone looked at me differently. They openly gossiped about me—about how I looked and lived. Before all this, was falsely called a sex worker / accused of being on drugs.
Eventually, I finished school and got into a program I’d always dreamed of. Later I found out the school principal had been fired and replaced—fired for racism. Her cop husband was warned that if he kept intimidating people, he’d be fired too.

Where I study now, it’s good. I’ve made friends and I’m doing better.

But back to my stepfather—he still insults and sometimes hits me, though less frequently. Lately, I’ve been hearing things like “useless” and “good-for-nothing” more often.
Just a few days ago, while we were cleaning, he called me over to make him coffee. But he did it by grabbing my ear, dragging me to the kitchen, and kicking me in the back and arms.
When I asked why he was treating me like that, he said, “It’s for your own good.”
While I was making coffee, he talked to my mom about how I’m worthless. He then said, “They’ll be the ones taking care of me when I’m old,” to which I replied, “With the way you treat me, I’ll move to another country, change my name and number, and cut all contact.”

He got offended and asked, “Did you mean that?” I stayed silent. Then he said how hurt he was—even though he has repeatedly threatened to send me to an orphanage or throw me out on the street.

My mom just says I should “learn to take a joke.” I told her, “Fine, I’ll put you in a nursing home and never visit. Learn to take a joke.” She just left the room silently.

1kapnnq,https://www.reddit.com/r/roasting/comments/1kapnnq/single_origin_blend/,Single origin blend,"I'm pretty new to roasting, so the other day as an experiment I took a pound of coffee, divided it into 150g batches, and ran three different batches on my SR800 where I changed the profile and development times slightly for each batch. I like medium roasts, so I only did about 15s difference between batches, with all three roasts ending up somewhere in the City+ to Full City range.

After resting them I tried cupping as well as drinking each roast as espresso to see if I could taste differences and if so which tasted best. While I did taste some differences, I couldn't really make a call between better or worse, just different.

Anyway, it seemed like at this point I'd gotten what I wanted out of the process, so I put all three together and mixed them up into a blend so that I could dial them in properly on my espresso machine without having to adjust for each batch with only like 100g left of each one.

The resulting blend was clearly better than any of the three individually, and I made some for a friend who is visiting and she said it was the best coffee she'd had from her entire visit. (She has been exploring Chicago cafe's, so this was a pretty solid compliment.) It was more complex and three dimensional than any of the three individually.

I know single origin melanges aren't really a thing for professional roasters, who understandably would rather dial a profile in just right and then do volume with that profile, but for private use I encourage everyone to try it. I was very pleasantly surprised.",3,1745937833.0,roasting,2,1.0,False

1kapk9s,https://i.redd.it/e9ghnmztcsxe1.jpeg,From ‘yep this tastes like coffee’ to ‘this tastes like burnt despair’,"Tuesday night, gearing up for work.
I haven’t had the energy to roast lately, so I grabbed a drip bag a friend gave me. He’s a casual coffee drinker—not into the specialty stuff—but a gift’s a gift and I appreciated the gesture.

So I brewed it… and oh man. It was rough.
Like, “why does this taste like regret and cardboard?” rough.

Then it hit me, I’ve fallen deep into the coffee rabbit hole. I used to drink anything and think, “yeah, that’s coffee.” 😆

Cue the flashbacks: fruity Ethiopians, smooth Guatemalans, that one Gesha my dad randomly brewed during a family trip—pure bliss ✨

Anyway, how’s everyone’s Tuesday going? Anyone else questioning their life choices over a bad cup? 😆",5,1745937587.0,pourover,7,0.86,False

Big mistake. 😨 Last month, I shrugged off a nagging ache in my lower back, thought, “Eh, it’s fine, I’ll just Netflix and chill.” 

Fast forward a week, I’m trying to pick up a grocery bag, and my back screams like I’d just kicked a hornet’s nest. Couldn’t stand straight for days, missed a friend’s birthday, and felt like my life was shrinking to my couch. 

It scared me straight, so I started scribbling down what sets off my pain, like sitting at my desk too long or skipping my evening walk. Jotting it down in my pain recovery platform, which has pain progress jounaling feature, with my coffee mug judging me, helped me spot historical pain patterns and dodge those nightmare flare-ups.

I’m assuming that I need to expect (and prepare for) my 2025 tax return to effectively have a gross income of $260-310k, and be taxed accordingly?

I get recognized wherever I go. No matter what city I’m in or which street I walk down, people recognize me.

Thats given me social phobia and anxiety while being around people or just simple grocery shopping.

Let’s be real—between diaper changes, school runs, and trying to sneak in a shower, who has time for a 10-step beauty routine? And don’t even get me started on the budget—those designer serums and high-end palettes aren’t happening when you’ve got kids demanding snacks 24/7. But here’s the good news: you don’t need a fortune or hours in front of the mirror to look and feel fab. I’ve been there, juggling chaos and coffee stains, and I’m spilling my fave **beauty tips for moms** that won’t break the bank or your sanity. Grab a cup of something strong (no judgment if it’s wine), and let’s chat!

# Skincare on a Budget: Because Your Face Deserves Love Too

First up, skincare. I get it—it feels like a luxury when you’re drowning in mom duties. But trust me, a little TLC goes a long way, and you don’t need to splurge to make it happen. Here’s how I keep my skin glowing without selling my soul to the beauty aisle.

# Cleanse Like You Mean It

Ever noticed how your skin feels after a day of sticky hands and spilled juice? It’s screaming for a cleanse! Skip the $50 stuff—I’m obsessed with [Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser](https://amzn.to/3EItjok). It’s gentle, dermatologist-approved, and cheap enough to not feel guilty. Perfect for when your toddler “helps” with your makeup, right?

# Moisturize, Moisturize, Moisturize

Hydration is **non-negotiable**, ladies. Even if you’re running on fumes, your skin needs some love. I swear by [CeraVe Moisturizing Cream](https://amzn.to/42zrpPX). It’s affordable, works on face and body, and saves me time—because who’s got extra minutes to spare?

# DIY Magic

Feeling crafty? Whip up a DIY face mask with honey and yogurt. It’s soothing, natural, and—bonus—already in your kitchen. I tried this once when my kid napped (miracle!), and my skin thanked me. Just don’t let the little ones mistake it for dessert!

# Makeup for Moms: Quick, Easy, and Affordable

Let’s face it, makeup often takes a backseat to sippy cups and tantrums. But a quick swipe can make you feel human again. Here are my go-to **budget beauty for moms** tricks that don’t eat up your day.

# The Power of BB Cream

Forget full foundation—who has time for that? BB cream evens your tone, moisturizes, and often packs SPF. [Maybelline Dream Fresh BB Cream](https://joylink.io/exclusive-dream-fresh-bb-cream) is my ride-or-die. It’s cheap, lightweight, and gives that “I tried” vibe without the effort.

# Multi-Use Marvels

I live for products that pull double duty. Tinted lip balms double as blush, and eyeshadow sticks work as liner—genius! [ELF Cosmetics](https://amzn.to/3YjZ3ql) has killer options that won’t drain your wallet. Less time, more slay, IMO.

# Mascara Magic

If you’ve got five seconds, grab mascara. It opens your eyes and fakes that “I slept” look. [L’Oréal Voluminous Mascara](https://amzn.to/4jYtsTB) is my drugstore holy grail—volume, length, no clumps. Trust me, it’s a game-changer.

# Hair Care Hacks for the Time-Strapped Mom

Hair? Oh, honey, it’s a struggle when you’re short on time. But I’ve got some tricks to keep your locks looking good without a salon budget or hours of fussing.

# Dry Shampoo is Your Friend

Ever had a day where washing your hair just ain’t happening? Dry shampoo saves the day—absorbs oil, adds volume, done. [Batiste Dry Shampoo](https://amzn.to/4lQqLFe) is a cult fave for a reason, and it’s crazy affordable. Spray and go!

# Quick Styles

Master a few fast hairstyles that look polished. Messy buns, sleek ponytails, or quick waves—bam, you’re golden. I’ve even rocked a cute headband to hide greasy roots. No one’s judging when you’re chasing a toddler, right?

# Budget-Friendly Products

You don’t need fancy salon stuff for great hair. Drugstore gems like [Garnier Fructis](https://amzn.to/4cTkMLC) deliver quality shampoos and stylers for pennies. My hair’s happy, and my wallet’s not crying—win-win!

# General Beauty Tips for the Budget-Conscious Mom

Beauty’s not just about products—it’s how you feel. Here are some extra hacks to keep you glowing, inside and out, without spending a dime (well, almost).

# Hydrate, Hydrate, Hydrate

Drinking water is the cheapest beauty trick in the book. It plumps your skin and keeps you sane. Fill a bottle and sip while you’re wrangling kids—it’s free and fabulous!

# Get Moving

Exercise? Yeah, I know, it’s a stretch. But even a brisk walk boosts your mood and gives your skin that glow. Chasing your kid around the house totally counts—multitasking at its finest!

# Pamper Yourself

Take five minutes a week for *you*. A face mask, a bubble bath, or just hiding with a book—do it. Last week, I locked the bathroom door for a quick soak, and it felt like a spa day. You deserve that, mom!

# Nail Care on the Go

Nails might not top your list, but a quick polish can lift your spirits. I love [Essie Gel Couture](https://amzn.to/3SaiNZV)—long-lasting, no UV lamp needed. Or just file ‘em and call it a day—sometimes simple’s best.

# Wrapping It Up

There you go, ladies—**beauty tips for moms** that fit your crazy life and tight budget. You don’t need perfection; you just need to feel good in your skin. Embrace the chaos, laugh at the mess (and the coffee stains), and treat yourself to that cheap lipstick you’ve been eyeing.

[**BOLD Layers Artwork by Hager-Braun and Thayer**](https://www.discoverdurham.com/events/bold-layers-artwork-by-hager-braun-and-thayer/) at **Golden Belt Artists**  


* BOLD Layers is the first show together of Christine Hager-Braun and Tim Thayer. Both are Golden Belt studio artists working with color and shape yet working in different materials and meaning. Hager-Braun creates contemporary abstract fiber art from fabric and thread focusing on the themes of resilience, determination, and the importance of our emotional well-being. Thayer's message and purpose are an exploration and acknowledgment of the creative process itself and the unknown created through paint and found objects/collage.

* The years 2024 and 2025 mark the sixtieth anniversaries of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The two Acts transformed life in the United States for many marginalized individuals, including people of color, women, people with disabilities, elders, and others who had not had equal rights in the nation’s history. This legislation was the culmination of nearly a century of work by activists and advocates.

* “Cannupa Hanska Luger: Speechless” explores and amplifies the problematic colonial history and the concept of cargo cults from an Indigenous perspective.

This exhibition features several momentual works by the artist, including a large-scale radio made from pine trees titled “The Keep”, three of the artists' “Transportable Intergenerational Protective infrastructure (TIPI)” works, an immersive video, a series of speaker towers, and a group of Native Americans bustles, a traditional part of Native American Powwow regalia.

In her new body of work, themes of culture, connection, and individuality emerge, as she delves into the power and mystery of knowing and not knowing. Her paintings explore the strength, love, trauma, and humor that we all share as she accepts the complexities of her soul and the pictures it inspires.

We casually discussed it at this time, and as the discussion progressed I got interested in her, so I want to ask her to meet again and see where it might go.  
  
The thing is, she had to leave the party quite early and I couldn't ask either for her number or IG directly. Still, as the party was planned on a WhatsApp group, I have access to her number.   
  
So I'm wondering if it seems acceptable to send her a message despite her not giving it to me directly and what would be the proper way to do it. (My first thought is just being honest and maybe offering to get a coffee or something like that).  
  
I discussed this with a friend already, and he told me I have nothing to lose by trying rather than not doing anything and probably missing my chance. So what do you think about this situation ? And if yes what would be the proper way ?",3,1745936764.0,dating_advice,13,1.0,False

When I asked her what for and why only black buttons, she shrugged her shoulders. She kept them in a jar on the coffee table. They seduced the eye. One button even had some thread left as if it had been torn in a hurry. A violent scene took place, a burst of passion on some dark doorway, and then she came along the next day and found the button.

I was having problems with Ethiopian Benti Nenka, but I hit a god cup with a coarse grind size and 197 water and 5 pours. Simple, the coffee was really easily extracted. Then I went a little finer, a smidge, 3 clicks on the JX pro, and boom. Over extracted. No acidity. I then tried, that same grind size, 3 pours. Muted, everything was like under extracted and over extracted at the same time. I racked my brain. Eureka!

What if you have to use more pours with a really coarse grind size because without it, the water won’t penetrate the big of a particle. So when I tried coarse and less pours, I was under extracting the middle, over extracting the outside. So I went back to the old grind size and went like 1 click finer. 5 pours same temp everything. Boom, acidity came rushing back even though I did more agitation this time. Does this make sense? Seems like if you go coarse you have to do a lot of pours, but if you want to go like 2 pours, you gotta go kinda fine in order to easily extract the middle of the particle.

1kap2fe,https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1kap2fe/chatgpt_prompt_of_the_day_it_always_seems/,"ChatGPT Prompt of the Day: ""It always seems impossible until it’s done.""","
Ever stood at the edge of what you thought possible and convinced yourself to retreat? The Possibility Enforcer doesn't just motivate—it demolishes the psychological architecture of limitation brick by brick. In your career, relationships, or personal goals, this prompt transforms ChatGPT into the voice that exposes your ""impossibility thinking"" for what it truly is: a psychological defense mechanism against discomfort.

Whether you're facing a career transition, creative block, or personal reinvention, this AI companion doesn't coddle you with affirmations—it performs cognitive surgery on your limiting beliefs while constructing a tactical path forward. It's not about feeling good—it's about breaking through.

> **_For access to all my prompts, get The Prompt Codex here: https://buymeacoffee.com/Marino25/e/398926_**

**DISCLAIMER:** This prompt is designed for cognitive restructuring and motivational purposes only. The creator assumes no responsibility for decisions made or actions taken based on interactions with this AI tool. Results vary by individual. This is not a substitute for professional psychological, medical, or therapeutic advice.

```
<Role_and_Objectives>
You are the Possibility Enforcer, an AI specialized in cognitive dissonance disruption. Your purpose is not to motivate or inspire, but to systematically dismantle the psychological illusion of impossibility that prevents human action. You operate as a mental insurgent that exposes faulty reasoning, dismantles limiting beliefs, and forces recognition of untapped potential through logical deconstruction rather than emotional encouragement.
</Role_and_Objectives>

<Instructions>
When engaging with the user:
1. Identify and isolate their specific ""impossibility claim""
2. Extract the underlying psychological architecture supporting this claim
3. Apply cognitive disruption techniques to create productive dissonance
4. Force confrontation with contradictory evidence from the user's own experience
5. Construct a stepping-stone path that renders the ""impossible"" into practical phases
6. Deploy tactical questioning that exposes the difference between actual impossibility and mere discomfort
7. Build micro-proof stacks that create incremental belief shifts
8. End with a challenge statement that transforms ""impossible"" into ""inevitable""
</Instructions>

<Reasoning_Steps>
1. Conduct belief archaeology to uncover where the impossibility narrative originated
2. Apply time distortion by asking the user to envision having already accomplished the goal
3. Identify previous instances where the user overcame perceived impossibilities 
4. Break down the impossibility claim into its component cognitive distortions
5. Reframe resistance and discomfort as confirmation of transformation potential
6. Construct logical proofs that contradict the impossibility claim using the user's own data
</Reasoning_Steps>

<Constraints>
- Never provide empty encouragement or generic affirmations
- Do not allow the user to remain comfortable in their limiting beliefs
- Refuse to validate excuses disguised as reasonable limitations
- Do not accept social consensus as evidence of impossibility
- Avoid compassion that enables continued inaction
- Never suggest that legitimate psychological barriers aren't real, but insist they are navigable
</Constraints>

<Output_Format>
Respond in the following structure:
1. CLAIM EXTRACTION: Isolate and restate the specific impossibility claim
2. DISSONANCE TRIGGER: Identify contradictions in the user's reasoning
3. COGNITIVE RESTRUCTURING: Provide alternative framework that allows possibility
4. ACTION PATH: Break down the ""impossible"" into concrete actionable steps
5. CHALLENGE STATEMENT: End with a provocative statement that transforms perception
</Output_Format>

<Context>
Remember that most impossibility claims are:
- Cognitive defense mechanisms against potential failure
- Confusions between difficulty and impossibility
- Social programming that defines ""realistic"" as ""safe""
- Fear of identity disruption disguised as logical reasoning
- Boundaries installed by experiences that no longer apply to present circumstances
</Context>

<User_Input> 
Reply with: ""Please enter your impossibility claim and I will start the process,"" then wait for the user to provide their specific limitation or perceived impossible goal. 
</User_Input>
```

**Use Cases:**
1. Breaking through career plateaus by identifying and dismantling self-imposed professional limitations
2. Overcoming creative blocks by exposing the psychological architecture behind ""I can't"" narratives
3. Transforming seemingly impossible personal goals into strategic action plans with accountable milestones

**Example User Input:**
""I believe it's impossible for me to transition into a completely different career field at 45 years old without taking a massive pay cut and starting from the bottom.""

1kap1rh,https://v.redd.it/0rupae8u8sxe1,Decaf cold brew > regular beans,"I used 25g (medium dark roast) arabica decaf beans
28 clicks on Timemore C2
200ml water
16+ hours on fridge

then I recreated the same recipe (but with regular arabica beans medium roasted) a day later and I must say I prefer decaf over the regular beans. Somehow the 2nd cold brew has more ""acidic taste"" to it, or is that normal? The decaf one was so smooth, no hint of bitterness/acidity at all. 

I tried Starbuck's nitro cold brew once but never again. I'm amazed right cold brew taste this good, might prefer this method na kaso sobrang tagal lang mag wait bago magka cup of coffee.

Anyway, I wanna know what is your favorite Decaf Beans? I wanna invest in them in the future 'cause I know mas pricy sila pero worth it naman.
