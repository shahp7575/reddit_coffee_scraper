“You can quit your job after marrying me. You just need to take good care of me at our home and give me a chubby little son within a year! No daughters, please. Daughters are expensive to raise!”

How very condescending.

The man who made that remark sat in front of Corrinne Carew, and he happened to be her prospective partner during a matchmaking session. At nearly 40 years of age, his hair was thinning and he had a pot belly.

Corinne’s stepmother, Lilliana Reece, was worried that she might end up marrying someone better and so forced her to meet with this crass, middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was initially very displeased with Corinne’s dark makeup because it was really heavy on the eyeshadow, but upon seeing her slender figure and decent character, he could imagine how deliciously beautiful she would be if she stood naked in front of him.

“And how tall are you again?” he asked.

Corinne absent-mindedly stirred the coffee inside the cup and replied curtly, “A hundred and sixty-eight centimeters.”

The middle-aged man was delighted to hear her answer. “Hmm… That’s more or less the standard of a woman that’s fit for me. My height is nearly one point eight meters, so I guess that’s what they call the perfect height difference for a couple! You’d have to tiptoe whenever you kiss me in the future, but that’s not really an issue. I can still bend you over and take you from behind!”

For the record, whenever men who like to talk big say that their height is nearly 1.8 meters, their true measurements were only 172 centimeters at most!

Corinne rolled her eye-shadowed eyelids and said, “I don’t think you’re aware of how tall a man is if his woman needs to stand on her toes to kiss him.”

The middle-aged man frowned unhappily. “What do you mean by that?”

At that point, a tall and stern-looking man walked into the cafe. He was 2.8 meters tall. As Corinne looked up and laid eyes on him, a playful twinkle appeared in her eyes. She decided to get up from her chair and walk over to him.

“Hey there, handsome. Could I borrow you for a sec to demonstrate what a true height difference is?”

The man frowned. Before he could refuse, Corinne grabbed his tie, yanked it downward, and tiptoed to plant a firm kiss on his thin lips.

“See? You need to be at least as tall as him for women to stand on tiptoe and kiss you!”

“How dare you…” The pot-bellied middle-aged man was angry due to that embarrassment. He stood up in a rage and pointed at Corinne, saying, “You wh\*re! Who the hell just grabs random men and kisses them? I’ll tell the person who introduced us to each other about your sluttiness soon enough. Your notoriousness will soon spread within the matchmaking circle, and you’ll never be able to find your perfect match here.”

‘That’d be perfect!’ Once word of her actions got out, her stepmother Lilliana would surely have a hard time trying to play matchmaker again!

Corinne snorted in disdain, kicked the crass, big-talking man away, then waved her hand in a gesture of thanks to the tall man who ‘stood up for her’ in her moment of need.

“Thanks for helping me out there, kind sir! See you around, I guess. Bye!” She ended her sentence and turned around to leave, but a palm that was cold to the touch grabbed her wrist.

“Are you just going to leave after kissing me without my consent?” a hoarse, stern male voice reached Corinne’s ears, and an oppressive chill came up her spine. She felt riveted when she looked up and saw the man’s handsome face.

His attractiveness knew no bounds.

There was a certain maturity and meticulousness in the way he styled his hair, chiseled facial features on his fair-skinned handsome face, and an expression brimming with danger and fierceness.

‘Uh-oh!’ Corinne had been so worked up about the man from her blind date that she just randomly chose the tallest man in sight without paying much attention to his appearance.

Upon a closer look, she came to realize just how uniquely handsome he really was! As if that were not enough, she could tell at a glance that there was more to him than what met the eye!

Corinne frowned slightly. “What do you expect me to do?”",1,1746699090.0,BlackNovel,0,1.0,False

I see a post in this sub reddit from a year ago that partially answers my question, but I need more info.

I am opening a little take-out restaurant and will be focusing on poké bowls, but will be serving boba tea, banh mi, and various street-food items.

I want to serve Vietnamese iced coffee. I want to do it authentically. I'm tired of seeing Vietnamese coffee on western menus only to find Arabica bean coffee-machine coffee with condensed milk. Luckily, there's plenty of vendors that sell real Robusta coffee from Vietnam (I'm in Norway).

My question is: How do the thousands of coffee shops in VN brew coffee for iced coffee in bulk?
I'm assuming that they don't put out dozens of phin filters and combine them (maybe they do 🤷‍♂️). 
I know they sell large phin filters, but that will still take a lot of repetition to get a large amount of pre-made coffee.

How do the aunties do it beforehand? 

I would like to make up to 5 liters to have on hand so that I can just drop in the condensed milk and servenat a high volume.

Thanks in advance! 😊

## What is Sumix Prowess?

**Sumix Prowess** is an automated trading platform designed to help users trade **cryptocurrencies, forex, stocks**, and more with minimal manual input. It uses **AI-based algorithms** to analyze market data in real-time and execute trades based on predetermined strategies.

Think of it like having a tireless, data-obsessed assistant who watches the markets 24/7 and jumps in at just the right moment. You set your preferences, and it does the heavy lifting. That’s the promise, at least.

Whether you're into **Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Tesla stock**, Sumix aims to help you trade more efficiently, even if you don’t have years of trading experience under your belt.

## Who Created Sumix Prowess?

The team behind Sumix Prowess has kept things relatively low-key, which isn’t entirely uncommon in the trading software world. From what I found, it appears to be developed by a group of experienced **fintech professionals and software engineers** who’ve worked on other automated platforms before.

While we don’t have a big-name founder to attach to the project (no Elon Musk here), the platform does borrow heavily from the same tech stack used in other reputable systems like **Bitcoin Code** and **Immediate Edge**. That’s both a good sign and a minor flag—it works well, but I’d love a little more transparency.

### [🔥 Start Trading with Sumix Prowess Today](https://t.co/lOSJT4s3B9)
## How Does Sumix Prowess Work?

Sumix Prowess uses **advanced algorithms** and **machine learning** to scan the markets, identify trends, and open or close trades based on your chosen settings. It’s kind of like giving your trading account autopilot mode—but with some manual controls.

Here’s the simplified flow:

- You set your **risk level**, asset preferences, and trading limits.
- The **algorithm** looks for profitable opportunities.
- When it finds a match, it **executes the trade** on your behalf.
- You can monitor everything in real-time and adjust settings as needed.

It’s super intuitive. Beginners can stick to the default settings, while more advanced users can tweak strategies to better suit their style.

## Sumix Prowess Pros and Cons

Like any platform, Sumix Prowess has its ups and downs. Here's my quick take:

**Pros:**

 I just got off the phone with you and decided to take this time to write you something. Where do I even start, seriously. The way you make me feel…let’s start with this. If I could describe this feeling it would have to be “you give me wings” you make me fly. Describing this may throw you off a little bit but my god do I feel untouchable when I’m with you. Your love, affection, touch, and kisses take me high above the clouds. I sometimes forget what’s going on around me and what stressors are in my life. Today, I brought up a few trips I’d like to take in my lifetime and in my head I pictured you with me on every single one. I pictured me holding your hand as the plane takes off to Maine, kissing you on the jetties as the lighthouse shines on the ocean and the sound of seagulls are Behind us. I pictured Laughing with you at a famous restaurant as we gobbled down luxury fish and lobster. I thought of looking at you as we walk in an old town, with tall street lights, your bitter cold hands touching mine and us kissing under the moon light as the different shades of leaves fall to the ground. 

When I brought up New York I thought of both us in big coats walking in Central Park with a mouth full of pizza. I began to look at you while you’re not looking and I hear hundreds of peoples voices in the back ground but all I see is your beautiful face. We take a walk to see a HUGE Christmas tree but on the way you asked if we could get some coffee. We make it to the tree and this moment couldn’t be more powerful…I turn to look at you and the dozens of lights from the tree ricochet from your beautiful black hair. You smell off coffee beans and expensive lotion lol and I can’t get enough of you. I kiss your forehead and we stare at the green colorful beauty.

When I spoke of Bahamas I thought of your sexy dark skin in a black swimsuit. You have your big face shades and you look heavenly. We are on the beach, toes in the sand and the kids are just laughing as they play with a kite. We’re both a little buzzed with drinks in our hands. You smile at me and ask me why I’m looking at you that way. I say “no reason babe” but I’m really thinking how beautiful you are. We stay on the beach for hours and play in the water. I take it a little too far and tackle you, pick you up and throw you in the water. Then swim to you and give you a big salty kiss. 

We’re on a cruise now and both of us are complaining about how small the rooms are and how we really don’t like the food. But you and I always make the best out of these type of situations so we decide to go to a country club on this big ass boat . I ask you for a dance and hold my hand out and you grab it with a huge buck tooth smile lol. I swing you around and we two step to some George Strait and Jason Aldean. Meanwhile we’re still In our swimming gear and we look like a hot mess. After this we walk to the end of the boat. And as gay as this sounds I’ve always wanted to kiss here just like the titanic. I grab you from behind and my chin is on your shoulder with my arms completely wrapped around you . We hear nothing waves crash against the walls of the boat and see nothing but darkness in front of us. I kiss you on your neck. 

Vegas! Now both of us are trying to let out some steam from working so hard and it’s a getaway without the kids. We pack our LV and Supreme luggage and jump on the first flight to sin city. We get tot he hotel and change into our best fits and step out on the town. We have dinner at some fancy restaurant, you look gorgeous as you take a sip of wine. I smile at you and you say what? I respond with “nothing babe” but I’m just thinking of how lucky I am.. we head to a few gambling spots and we play a few slot machines. You sit on top of me while I’m barely winning Pennies on the damn thing but you turn your head and I kiss you as the sounds of the music, laughter of people, and slot machines fill the room. 

I figured this might bring a smile to your face. I wanted you in my world for a minute ..think heavy on these moments because you will forever live In my mind and heart. I love you forever, MK. I mean that .

“You can quit your job after marrying me. You just need to take good care of me at our home and give me a chubby little son within a year! No daughters, please. Daughters are expensive to raise!”

How very condescending.

The man who made that remark sat in front of Corrinne Carew, and he happened to be her prospective partner during a matchmaking session. At nearly 40 years of age, his hair was thinning and he had a pot belly.

Corinne’s stepmother, Lilliana Reece, was worried that she might end up marrying someone better and so forced her to meet with this crass, middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man was initially very displeased with Corinne’s dark makeup because it was really heavy on the eyeshadow, but upon seeing her slender figure and decent character, he could imagine how deliciously beautiful she would be if she stood naked in front of him.

“And how tall are you again?” he asked.

Corinne absent-mindedly stirred the coffee inside the cup and replied curtly, “A hundred and sixty-eight centimeters.”

The middle-aged man was delighted to hear her answer. “Hmm… That’s more or less the standard of a woman that’s fit for me. My height is nearly one point eight meters, so I guess that’s what they call the perfect height difference for a couple! You’d have to tiptoe whenever you kiss me in the future, but that’s not really an issue. I can still bend you over and take you from behind!”

For the record, whenever men who like to talk big say that their height is nearly 1.8 meters, their true measurements were only 172 centimeters at most!

Corinne rolled her eye-shadowed eyelids and said, “I don’t think you’re aware of how tall a man is if his woman needs to stand on her toes to kiss him.”

The middle-aged man frowned unhappily. “What do you mean by that?”

At that point, a tall and stern-looking man walked into the cafe. He was 2.8 meters tall. As Corinne looked up and laid eyes on him, a playful twinkle appeared in her eyes. She decided to get up from her chair and walk over to him.

“Hey there, handsome. Could I borrow you for a sec to demonstrate what a true height difference is?”

The man frowned. Before he could refuse, Corinne grabbed his tie, yanked it downward, and tiptoed to plant a firm kiss on his thin lips.

“See? You need to be at least as tall as him for women to stand on tiptoe and kiss you!”

“How dare you…” The pot-bellied middle-aged man was angry due to that embarrassment. He stood up in a rage and pointed at Corinne, saying, “You wh\*re! Who the hell just grabs random men and kisses them? I’ll tell the person who introduced us to each other about your sluttiness soon enough. Your notoriousness will soon spread within the matchmaking circle, and you’ll never be able to find your perfect match here.”

‘That’d be perfect!’ Once word of her actions got out, her stepmother Lilliana would surely have a hard time trying to play matchmaker again!

Corinne snorted in disdain, kicked the crass, big-talking man away, then waved her hand in a gesture of thanks to the tall man who ‘stood up for her’ in her moment of need.

“Thanks for helping me out there, kind sir! See you around, I guess. Bye!” She ended her sentence and turned around to leave, but a palm that was cold to the touch grabbed her wrist.

“Are you just going to leave after kissing me without my consent?” a hoarse, stern male voice reached Corinne’s ears, and an oppressive chill came up her spine. She felt riveted when she looked up and saw the man’s handsome face.

His attractiveness knew no bounds.

There was a certain maturity and meticulousness in the way he styled his hair, chiseled facial features on his fair-skinned handsome face, and an expression brimming with danger and fierceness.

‘Uh-oh!’ Corinne had been so worked up about the man from her blind date that she just randomly chose the tallest man in sight without paying much attention to his appearance.

Upon a closer look, she came to realize just how uniquely handsome he really was! As if that were not enough, she could tell at a glance that there was more to him than what met the eye!

Corinne frowned slightly. “What do you expect me to do?”",1,1746698421.0,Hot_Romance_Stories,0,1.0,False
1khmaox,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicalKeyboards/comments/1khmaox/im_giving_my_keychron_k6_pro_one_last_chance/,I'm giving my Keychron K6 Pro one last chance.,"My Keychron K6 Pro is the keyboard I like the least. My typo rate with this keyboard is too high. Right out of the box, I wasn't sure whether it was the keycap profile, the pitch between the keys, or the switches that caused the issue.  
I first swapped the switches for Keychron G2 (blue) clicky switches, but without much success.  
This time, I opted for Kailh Box Navy switches, which require 75g of actuation force.  
I'm assuming my typos are linked to the fact that when I press a key, I also tend to press the neighboring key due to the low pitch between them.  
Using switches that require a higher actuation force should help prevent accidentally triggering a neighboring key if it isn't pressed firmly enough.  
I topped the switches with a set of Johanna Coffee SA profile keycaps that I bought for €19 on Aliexpress.  
The result is, in my opinion, visually beautiful — but of course, that's subjective. However, the main goal of reducing my typos seems to have been achieved for now.  
That said, I still don't think I'm made for anything other than 96% or full-size (100%) keyboards.

What do you think about this? Are you a fan of layouts smaller than 100%, and what is your opinion on the tighter key pitch found on smaller keyboards?

He said to never contact him again. I respected that. I sent a final closure message stating how i felt and why I initiated the break up (apologising and explaining with regrets…..)

I went on with my life for the next 3-4 days, accepting that he will no longer be in my life. Yesterday, he texted me and spammed me messages wanting to talk and also called me (which i didnt reply at first but i gave in). I responded to talk it out.

We agreed to meet for coffee today. He told me that we are not compatible and during the talk, he said he just doesnt feel that we are compatible. And we left the cafe, amicably (he initiated a hug). He said we could stay friends and told me not to block him. We texted after the departure and agreed to be chill with each other.

I am left feeling confused and sad…. Why did you come back and text me? Was it a moment of weakness?…. The meet up was not supposed to happen, should have just left me alone…. But he said he appreciated the closure…. I guess if that makes him feel better, then let it be…….

I will bear the consequences of my actions…..

We had a conversation two weeks ago where she talked about how she needs to try harder and how she is going to put in more effort for intimacy. 

Well, the day after she dropped on me that the only days that are on the table are 24 out of the year. With the likeylyhood that one of us are on our period for one of those, we have 12 opportunities a year. Most of the time what happens is she says she needs out food and a fancy coffee. We go out for a while, she has to wind down from the day for hours, we try but by then it's too late. 

So, even with her best effort, it's still probably going to be much less than 10 times a year. 

One of those days is this weekend and she just mentioned that she's tired, so she's not going to be doing anything this weekend(not specifically indicating sex, more she's just going to try to relax)

1khm8vq,https://www.reddit.com/r/limerence/comments/1khm8vq/i_had_never_been_in_limerence_before_being_aware/,I had never been in Limerence before. Being aware of it makes more painful.,"I met someone at work. I am deeply infatuated with this person. I know she does appreciate me as a colleague. However the uncertainty of knowing if she harbors feelings similar to mine is deeply troubling. Even if she were to reciprocate. It would do no good. I am married. And I have a strong moral code. I do not want to cheat on my wife.

After being married for a time, and having a child, we lost ourselves. Since day one my wife has been devoted to the child. I struggled to find a place as a father and as a husband. Today I found my place as a father but I feel like I have no place as a husband. I know for a fact that this attraction to another person is a symptom of this. Rationally, it makes no sense. I actually recognize this and feel all the more ashamed because of it.

Since LO arrived at the workplace, she has been “close” to me, in the sense that for her I have been a point of reference since we met during the interview process and I had to keep in touch with her during her onboarding process. During the first days it was more comfortable for her to come to me for help because of this. We also have some common background, same degree, similar origins, which makes me more relatable.  I felt nothing romantic during this time, but I guess it felt good to be needed and useful. 

As time went by I noticed she had beautiful eyes. I thought nothing of it since in any case I have always noticed the features of female coworkers. That’s just nature. What ails me deeply, is that I believe I started to catch signals. Mostly how she looked at me (knowing i like her eyes) and overall body language. It ails me because I have trained myself to recognize body language in order to better do my job. However with her I cannot be certain. It cast doubt in my ability to discern genuine interest from normal body language. But the fact of the matter is that from that moment I fell for her.

I feel better when I see her or talk to her, even via chat. Sad when I don’t. I am compelled to maintain eye contact when talking face to face. Weekends feel terribly long. I feel jealous when she interacts with other male coworkers. And overall ashamed of my feelings. I think that part of me only wants to know if she actually feels attracted to me, just to confirm that the body language and signals I think I detected, and feel that I am not dumb or delirious.

I am tired of being in an altered state of mind. One morning I got very angry. For no particular reason. When I reached the office I was hoping to seeing my LO and to make my anger go away. However, as the morning went by I realized she was working from home. I felt stupid.

The next day I woke up sad with a pessimistic outlook on life. Since she was not at the office the day before I did not expect her to be in that day. And that made me sad, among other things because it was going to be a long time before I saw her again: the next day was bank holiday, the day after the weekend and on Monday she was going to start working off-site. That, also made me angry. I felt like an idiot because my happiness is contingent on seeing a person that has no idea that seeing her makes me happy.

As It turns out she was in that day. I was late to the office and feeling sad until she asked me if I was coming. I was elated even though it probably meant nothing. We had a coffee and a chat in the morning and it felt great, like we were old friends. I also had lunch with her. She seemed elsewhere. Probably because she had her sights set on an exam on the afternoon. We had a coffee on the afternoon as well with another male colleague I appreciate. However, even though he’s marrying, I felt a bit jealous because it felt to me as if she was more at ease with him. Probably because there is no age gap between them.

On the afternoon, with of the end of the day looming, I felt really sad and I did something that I think is really childish even though my brain told me not to: I know she likes a particular type of coffee capsules. Coffee at our company is free but those capsules are rarely available. I swept the entire building looking those and I prepared a small packet with napkins. A way of saying “please remember me”. Since she was in meetings, my plan was to leave the packet for her to find where I was sitting, because I needed to leave. I told her I was leaving via chat. She left her meeting to give me an update on something we were both working on. I told her the packet was for her. She took it and she told me we wouldn’t be seeing each other for at least a month, since she’ll be off site. That piece of information came down like a hammer. I did not think it would be so long. I told her I was going to miss her. And she went back into her meeting. She thanked me via chat for the gift with a smiley. I told her it was a farewell gift. She responded with a heart. I thought of the ending of the movie AI: one last perfect day. That’s how it felt. I was numb on the way home.

I spent a terrible night. So far I had never dreamt of her. This time I did. On the morning a swell of emotions hit me REALLY HARD. The sadness of knowing I won’t be seeing her in a long time and that my feelings will fade. The fear of relapsing since I will see her again eventually. The shame and guilt to thread it all because I am married. The loneliness of carrying the burden with no one to talk to.

Sea-inspired colors

Wooden Accents

I’m definitely gonna go, but I’m not sure how to act.

So, here’s the deal — I’ve been out of the game for a while. Life took a few unexpected turns, and I became a single dad. It’s been a wild, rewarding ride focusing on raising my little man, but now that the dust has settled a bit, I’m realizing I miss adult conversations, laughs, and yeah, maybe a bit of flirtatious fun too.

About me:

* 30 years old, down to earth and sarcastic by default, with a soft spot for dad jokes (sorry in advance).
* My hobbies include stepping on LEGO in the dark, trying to cook like I’m on a cooking show, and pretending I understand how the school app works.
* I’m emotionally available, baggage-claimed, and just looking to connect — whether it’s a witty exchange, flirty chats, or something that grows into more.

About you:

* Someone who’s open-minded, good-humoured, and doesn’t mind a guy who occasionally has to pause a conversation because of bedtime chaos.
* Bonus points if you're into cosy nights, coffee-fuelled mornings, or can recommend a good show to binge when the kiddo’s asleep.

Not looking to rush anything — just good convo, mutual vibes, and maybe some playful banter to break the ice.

Coffee in the cupholder, sunglasses on, vibes immaculate. I was driving the same boring stretch of highway I’d driven a hundred times before — a straight shot with nothing but trees, signs, and the occasional smug SUV. To break the monotony, I hit play on a podcast hosted by three guys who sounded like they were recording from inside a collapsing circus tent.

One had the voice of a smooth-talking audiobook narrator, another sounded like he was always mid-eye roll, and the third? A human car alarm with the energy of a raccoon who just found caffeine. They were telling stories, arguing about something stupid — I think it involved who would win in a fight between them and a bear, or maybe a bear-themed vending machine. The details are foggy. What I *do* remember is that one of them made a sound so outrageous — part goose, part kazoo, part spiritual awakening — that I laughed harder than I ever have behind the wheel.

Tears filled my eyes. My abs clenched involuntarily. I was mid-chortle when I realized I had stopped steering.

My car, a loyal but confused sedan, veered gently off the road like it was trying to remove itself from the situation. We bounced into a ditch, past a ""Caution: Soft Shoulder"" sign, and came to a gentle but humiliating stop against a decorative boulder shaped like a frog. The airbag deployed. My coffee exploded. My GPS solemnly announced: ""Recalculating.""

And through it all? The podcast was still playing. One of them was arguing about dirt. Another was yelling something about a horse. The third was wheezing like a haunted accordion. I sat there, bruised in body but not in spirit, and realized I had just become *that* listener. The one who crashes their car because three adult men are yelling nonsense into microphones.

Since then, I've driven only in complete silence. But sometimes, late at night, I swear I can still hear a distant voice saying, ""Technically, I'm right,"" followed by uncontrollable laughter and a sound like a rubber chicken being run over by a lawnmower.

Be careful out there.

Everyone is entitled their own opinion.
But I feel like, purple prose is really popular amongst the people here… which confuses me a little.
I would be really interested in your reasoning and your opinion. What is the appeal?

To me: When someone layers on metaphor after metaphor or uses grand, overly elaborate language for a simple idea, it reads like the writer isn't sure if their thoughts are interesting enough. I always feel like they have to coat them in poetic flourishes to give them artificial weight. — like the writer doesn't trust the raw thought or feeling to stand on its own.


The best advice I ever got was this:
""If you want to convey big emotion, go small"" means that the most powerful emotional writing comes from focusing on small, concrete, and specific details rather than grand, sweeping declarations. It makes it real. Relatable.
Look at the difference:


Overblown: 
""He screamed his heartbreak to the stormy skies, weeping an ocean of tears as his entire world collapsed around him.""

Small: 
""He stood quietly at the table, staring at two untouched cups of coffee, now slowly growing cold. He had filled hers again. Habit, hope, denial-was there even a difference anymore? For a moment he paused- then poured them both down the sink.""

Today me and Rowley went to clean up Roderick’s room. Why? Because he'll give us a pretty penny if we do it.

His room was disgusting. Cheetos everything, paper balls blocking my footsteps. Most importantly there were a lot of magazines.

I didn't look because mom said, I'll go to hell if I see any magazines that have adult women in them that aren't her or our neighbours.

Unfortunately I forgot to tell Rowley about my magazine limitation.

He picked a weird magazine, titled Moto mamas.

There  in a bikini who was being all whatever a motorcycle.  

I think I knew why Roderick had it but Rowley had a different idea.

“He loves motorcycles,"" Rowley said.

Normally I would tell him the truth, but it's too funny to be honest.

So I joke about him being in love motorcycles 

After me and Rowley went on to clean Roderick's filth cave.

After we were done he gave us our reward.
An actual penny.

Seriously I did that for a coin!

Rowley being Rowley danced like it was the one piece.

Tuesday 

At school I was getting heat of Rodricks deception. 

Wait, should it be honest. He actually said a penny.

At lunchtime Rowley was talking to everyone on how Rodrick is in love with motorcycles.

Chirag Gupta went to my locker asking if this is true. 

Well I wanted some vengeance. So I lied about Rodrick being romantic with motorcycles 

A few hours later everyone was talking about Rodrick and his Juliet motorcycle.

After school we saw a motorcycle with an intimidating biker. He had these spikes on his helmet, and glass that made his eyes invisible to my naked eye.

At home mom I told mom that Rodrick cheated me.

She said Rodrick was being all ‘honest’.

Man she never listens 

Rodrick came late to dinner claiming he was rehearsing a band but it was all Grinchey.

Wednesday 

In school the talk about Rodrick being romantic with motorcycles was all the rage.

Clyde Thompson came to me and said, I'll be calling for bikes like Rodrick too.

I didn't care because Clyde failed 10 times over. He looks like fossils like a horseshoe crab.

Saw Rodrick being bullied. The bullies called him motorhead for choosing motorcycles as dates.

The girls Rodrick’s age were screaming like banshees at him for choosing mike's over then at that they ain't good enough for him.

Really girls that are interested in Rodrick.

After that Rodrick was all bruised upike was beaten up in a war.

Wait I saw him being shoved in a locker.

Thursday 

In science class. Holly Hills herself was on stage for the presentation.

I was excited. But it's about men being in love with motorcycles.

She went on to say that the number of boys with bikes has increased while boys in relationships have gone south.

She then talked about the end of man coming from boys choosing motorcycles.

Rowley was listening all the way. He told me that the world is going to end because of Rodrick.

Well I wasn't the only one who fell for Holly's paranoia. Right?

Well. All the boys attack Rodrick, bullying him about motorcycles.

While the girls through coffee at him for dooming the world 

After that, they decided to stay near Rodrick. The dude looked like he was holding gallons of tears from the looks of it.

But a group of bikers came.
They were huge towering over us.

Their leader's motor head came.

Motor head claimed Rodrick dishonoured the motorcycle and they kidnapped him.

I could fight them but it's like a cat fighting an elephant.

Friday
Well Rodrick's been missing a Day.
Dad told me it's taken your kid to work and it was Rodrick's turn to come.

Well I told him Rodrick was on Tour for his band. Which made that break his teeth, ranting about Rock music ruining teens.

What am I supposed to say? Rodrick was kidnapped by evil bikers by me finding a magazine. Mom would ground me for life.

So I decided to take problems into my own hands.

I went to Rowley's house to get his help. Rowley was in this armour, preparing for what he called bikagidon.

I told him why Rodrick actually had the magazine which set his mind straight.

We searched for the bikers and found nothing.

Rowley googled the natural habitat of bikers which turned out to be a bar.

We went to the nearest bar and in no time found Rodrick who was at death's door.

The bikers were there beating him to a puddle.

I remember there were girls who were mad at the boy who liked bikes.

I called holly about the bikers and alike 1000 girls showed up 

She attacked the bikers. The bikers not giving a punch allowed the girl to finish him.

He saw  Rodrick, who was unconscious, dragging to my house.

Well I'm not looking at magazines again and Rodrick not take your kid to work days.

1khlnyy,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1khlnyy,I lost the first mouse/pet I ever had. I feel bad about how sudden it was.,"I lost my oldest pet mouse last Monday night, she just left peacefully – I thought she was only sleeping. I've had her for 9 months. It was too brief. I was hoping she could stay with us for another Christmas, but she quickly became lethargic the day I brought home the two little ones.  
  
I had to euthanize her first companion due to a large tumor, just a month after they had been together. She was alone for a few days but she was still active and normal before I introduced her to a new companion. Then, just three weeks ago, she lost her second companion, whom she had been with for six months. She was appearing less energetic the first few days, but she was starting to be normal again, although she was eating less and was looking thinner than her normal healthy shape. I thought she would be excited and happy to have new companions. I brought home a pair. At first, she was aggressive like she usually is with a new companion. But the next day, she became dejected and was barely leaving her spot. I brought her upstairs to walk and roam freely for a few minutes before I went to sleep. Then on Monday, I separated her from the two new companions to see if she would come back to normal, but she was just staying put, staring into space and not sleeping. I awoke at night due to a heavy rain, went down and checked on her, and she was gone. Just like that. I cried for a bit while I drank my coffee before heading to work. 

She isn’t showing any signs of illness, and I’m not sure if mice can lose the will to live out of sadness. But it looked as if she were just waiting for the end. I don’t know if I made her sad by bringing new companions – because as soon as she met them, she became dejected. I keep thinking that if I hadn’t decided to give her a companion, she might still be with us. Then again, I was originally planning to get only one mouse, but at the last second, I brought home a pair. Maybe my heart mouse didn’t want to leave me until I had a new set of mice to take care of. I just feel very sad because of the sudden loss. I wish I could've done more for her.

I'm a first-time owner and I've never had any pets before. I'm seeking advice on how to be better and also any clarification on what just happened. Did she become overly depressed because she had already lost two companions?

First photo: When she was still active and happy.

Second photo: Just a few days before she passed. I don't know why she just stared into space all day.",4,1746695688.0,PetMice,2,1.0,False

I’ve been brewing coffee at home for the past 7 years—everything from espresso to V60, moka pot, and cold brew. Currently, I’m using the 1Zpresso K-Ultra for both V60 and espresso, and while it’s been great, I’m now looking to invest in a solid electric grinder that can handle espresso-level grind consistency.

I’ve searched Shopee and Lazada but haven’t found many good options for quality espresso grinders. So I’m wondering—where do you guys get your grinders from? Are there specific websites, retailers, or physical shops (especially in or around Penang) that you’d recommend?

Appreciate any suggestions!

Most people see freelancing online and think it's just laptops, coffee shops, and freedom.
But the truth?

A freelancer is a developer, marketer, project manager, accountant, and support agent all in one.

When I started freelancing, I made every mistake possible:

Writing weak proposals

Accepting unclear projects

Undervaluing my work

Chasing payments for weeks


But I also learned:

Always define the scope, deadline, and payment terms in writing

Don’t price based on what others charge — price based on value and effort

You don’t need hundreds of clients. You need the right ones.

A strong portfolio beats a degree every time


Thinking about going freelance?
Ask yourself: Can you market yourself? Handle pressure? Work without external structure?

Question for you:
If you're already freelancing, what's the hardest lesson you've learned?
And if you're just starting, what scares you the most?

Let's share real stories.

You’re not just a developer anymore — you’re a marketer, a project manager, a negotiator, and a support agent.

Soft skills matter just as much as tech skills. Communication, time management, and client handling are everything.

1khllhk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Filmmakers/comments/1khllhk/film_school_advice_from_a_soontobe_graduate/,FILM SCHOOL ADVICE FROM A SOON-TO-BE GRADUATE,"I've seen alot of film students, including myself, post more on this subreddit recently, and I noticed a solid percentage of them were either about the trials and tribulations of being in film school or whether they should attend in the first place. As much as I know my opinion may ultimately mean nothing to perspective film students in the long run, I wanted to give at least some advice I was never given when I decided to go to school for film: 

  
**1. Work as much as you can outside of school related projects!**

I noticed this alot with many of my classmates, in that they were so far consumed with their own projects and getting them done for school that they never really looked at getting experince outside of film school. I was incredibly lucky and was able to intern at an editing house for close to two years and it gave me boundless more insight than what editing classes in my program would have given me. From my limited experince, filmmaking is 70% practice and 30% theory. 

Get onto as many sets as possible and do as many things as possible, whether that be running batteries, helping to hold the boom for the sound recordist, or even doing the classic PA past-time of running to grab coffees for the crew. These experiences, can not only help you get your name out there more, but also help you figure out what niche you prefer to have on set and where you want to put the most amount of effort into specializing in. 

**2. Network, Network, Network**

Tying into the previous point, it's important that you get your name out there as much as possible to as many people as possible. If the city you are located in has a somewhat present film industry try to go to as many mixers as possible, and the best way to find out about those is either Facebook groups or even LinkedIn. Heck, even posting about yourself or posting a question on your local filmmaking facebook group can garner you some connection and people that may even be able to help mentor you in what you are interested in. 

One of the biggest advantages many film students have in networking is being students. I have found that you can cold message someone on LinkedIn and get a response from them around 50% of the time if you pose your message as being a curious student who wishes to learn. Often times, the people who respond were in the same shoes as you at one point. 

But most importantly, be patient and kind to those who are willing to converse with you. The amount of times I have seen classmates fumble connections is insane, as many of them come at it as if the people they are talking to owe them their time. 

**3. Be Kind & Be Patient**

This point I think is probably the most important. For those of you who have gone to film school, or are currently in film school, you may already understand what I'm getting at here. For those contemplating going to film school, this incredibly important. During your degree path you may bump into people or groups who will act as if film school is High School. You will find many of your classmates forming into cliques and creating their own ecosphere from which nobody is allowed to enter. Many of these people are so far up their own butts they are practically sniffing their colon. 

My only advice in avoiding this is being open to others and not allowing tribalism to block colaboration. While these popular cliques may seem to be all emcompassing, the second many of these people get out into the real world, they will soon find that high school politics dont work on professional sets. Sure there is still alot of gatekeeping in some areas of the industry, but more than likely you will still find more people who are accepting of newcomers than those who want to bar them out. 

But its also important to be patient with people. We are in an incredibly choatic industry and sometimes people's wires get crossed and stuff gets forgotten. If this happens, its important to be kind and open with them about what you are wanting to get done. However, this does not mean to let people walk all over you. In both school and on sets you will occasionally find people who are lazy and do their work to the bare minimum. For these guys, its best to just keep on them politely, but if that doesnt work out, then don't be afraid of severing ties with them in a professional manor. 

**4.**  **Teachers don't always know best**

This point is a bit more abstract and school dependant. In your program you will find two types of professors: those who are still working porfessionals, and those who are just professors. What I mean by this is that you will have some teachers who straight up have no clue about what is happening in the industry outside of your campus and will often give you dated advice. However, this is not to totally dismiss them entirely, as sometimes the advice they give may be good common sense. But they will be very unknowledgeable in specific areas or think they are the best filmmakers in the world. A great example of this is my programs director who thinks he is literally the second coming of Scorcese, but his films are actually worse than some student films*.* 

As for those who are still praticing professionals, they may have way more insight, but not the best professional practice. A personal example that comes to mind is when I worked with one of my professors at the editing house I was interning at. The way he edited and communicated, was suboptimal to say the least. But it was because of him I got that internship, so I learned that its best to do as they say but not as they do. 

  
**Final Thoughts:** 

This four-point guide is nowhere near universal on the experinces you may have in film school. Some programs are fantastic and are ran very smoothly, then there are some that are money pits that really give you no clue as to what filmmaking really is. Ultimatly the choice to go to film school or stay in it is up to you. But as a veteran of poorly run sets, nonsensicle drama, great first experinces, and everything in between, there is still massive amounts of opportunity in this industry and its there for the taking. Its solely up to you whether or not you want to put in the effort of getting it. 

If you decide this is for you, there are going to be alot of negative people crawling out of the wood work to tell you that the industry is full and that you will be out in the next 5 years. They will also say that this is a terrible time to join filmmaking, but in all reality, in my limited experience, I have found that there really is no good time. This industry is always in flux and its best to role with the punches and do the best you can with what you have.

1khlkzz,https://i.redd.it/hhgaxrmzxize1.jpeg,The Power of Branding: Why Logos Are More Than Just Pretty Pictures,"Ever wondered why some brands just stick in your mind while others fade away? Let’s talk about the magic of branding—and no, it’s not just about a fancy logo It’s about what that logo represents. Check out this eye-opening graphic I stumbled across:

Apple 🍎: iPhones aren’t the most advanced phones, but they scream status symbol.
Starbucks ☕: Not the best coffee, but it’s the vibe—happiness in a cup.
Toyota 🚗: Not your dream car, but you know it’s safe and reliable.
McDonald’s 🍔: Not gourmet burgers, but cheap, fast, and always there for you.
Branding isn’t just a logo—it’s what the logo represents. And let me tell you a story that’ll make you see branding in a whole new light.

Last year, my neighbor Lisa decided to throw a fancy dinner party. She spent hours cooking, but when it came to drinks, she didn’t grab the generic soda from her fridge. Nope—she proudly pulled out a couple of Coca-Cola bottles. Why? Because that silver can with the iconic logo made the night feel special. It wasn’t about the soda itself; it was about the memories of childhood, celebrations, and that “Coke” feeling of joy. Her guests lit up, and the vibe of the party instantly leveled up. That’s branding—it’s emotion, it’s connection, it’s a story in a single glance. 

Here’s the kicker: great branding can make or break a business. Remember when Coca-Cola tried to change its formula in the ‘80s with “New Coke”? People lost their minds—not because the new taste was bad, but because Coca-Cola wasn’t just a drink. It was nostalgia, happiness, and tradition. They brought back the original formula because the brand’s identity mattered more than the product.

So, Reddit, let’s hear it! What’s a brand that’s won you over—not because of the product, but because of what it stands for? Drop your stories below—I’m ready to be amazed! 🚀

1khljnn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NestorBlend/comments/1khljnn/foods_that_should_never_touch_your_fridge/,Foods That Should Never Touch Your Fridge,"Here are some foods that generally should not be stored in the refrigerator to maintain their optimal flavor, texture, and quality:

Fruits:

- Tomatoes:  Refrigeration can make them mealy and diminish their flavor. They are best stored at room temperature.

- Bananas: Cold temperatures slow down ripening. If you want to ripen them, keep them at room temperature. Once ripe, you can refrigerate them to extend their shelf life, but the peel will turn brown.

- Avocados: Like bananas, they ripen best at room temperature. Refrigerating them will halt the ripening process.

- Melons (whole): Whole melons like watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew should be stored at room temperature until they are cut. Refrigeration can dull their flavor and slow down the increase of antioxidants. Once cut, they should be refrigerated.

- Stone Fruits (peaches, nectarines, plums, apricots): These fruits ripen best at room temperature. Refrigerating them before they are ripe can result in a mealy texture and loss of flavor. Once ripe, they can be stored in the refrigerator for a few days.

- Berries: It's generally best to store berries at room temperature and avoid washing them until you are ready to eat them. Moisture can encourage mold growth.


Vegetables:

- Potatoes: Refrigeration can convert their starch into sugars, leading to a sweet taste and gritty texture. Store them in a cool, dark, and dry place like a pantry or cellar.

- Onions: Refrigeration can make onions soft and prone to mold. They are best stored in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place, away from potatoes.

- Garlic: Similar to onions, refrigeration can cause garlic to become rubbery and sprout. Store it in a cool, dry, and well-ventilated place.

- Cucumbers: Cold temperatures can cause cucumbers to become watery and develop a pitted surface. Store them in a cool place or on the countertop.

- Bell Peppers: Refrigeration can make bell peppers lose their crispness. They are best stored at room temperature for optimal texture.

- Winter Squash (butternut, acorn, etc.): These should be stored in a cool, dry place outside of the refrigerator.


Other Items:

- Bread: Refrigeration dries out bread and makes it stale faster. Store it at room temperature in a bread box or sealed bag, or freeze it for longer storage.

- Coffee (beans or ground): Refrigeration can cause coffee to lose its flavor and aroma and absorb odors from other foods in the fridge. Store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

- Honey: Refrigeration can cause honey to crystallize and become thick and difficult to pour. It is best stored at room temperature.

The stars above twinkled softly, a backdrop to the quiet peace that had settled over the world after the war. In his arms, cradled carefully against his chest, was his daughter—tiny, delicate, and more precious than anything he had ever known.

She had only been born a few days ago, yet already, Lucifer had found an unspoken connection with her—something deeper than words, something older than time.

The newborn stirred slightly in his arms, her tiny wings fluttering like whispers of wind. Her eyes, glowing faintly with the light of both demon and angel, locked onto his face. It was as if she could see him in ways even he had never been seen before.

""Hey there, little one,"" he whispered, his voice unusually soft. ""You’re safe now. I promise.""

Her tiny hand reached up, her fingers weak but determined as they grasped at his finger. His heart swelled with an unfamiliar warmth. He couldn’t help but smile—a rare, genuine expression that softened his fierce features.

For a long while, he simply held her, feeling the steady rhythm of her breathing against his chest. It was peaceful. Quiet. A peace he never thought he’d find.

After a moment, Lucifer lowered his voice again, speaking to her as if the entire universe was listening, but only she could hear.

“You know, they’ll tell you stories about your father and mother. About all the battles we’ve fought.”

He paused, letting the weight of his words hang in the air before continuing.

“But to you... We are just your parents. And we’ll protect you with everything we have. From the dark... and from the light, if I must.”

His daughter made a soft cooing sound, a smile curling on her tiny lips as if understanding him in her own way. Her wings flitted softly, sending out a gentle breeze that ruffled Lucifer’s hair. He chuckled quietly, a sound that was surprisingly full of warmth.

""You’ll be strong,"" he murmured. ""Stronger than I ever was. But you’ll also be kind. You’ll have the heart of your mother.""

Lucifer shifted, bringing her closer to his chest, and slowly, he rocked her in his arms, humming a lullaby—one that echoed with both angelic beauty and deep notes. It was a lullaby he had never imagined singing, not even to himself.

But to her, it felt right.

The stars above seemed to shine a little brighter as he continued to hum. For the first time in his existence, Lucifer felt whole—his heart filled with love and hope for the future, a future that was no longer shaped by darkness alone.

This child, this beautiful soul who carried both light and shadow, would be his redemption.

And, for the first time in his life, Lucifer was content to simply be a father.


Six months later, the villa in Hell was no longer quiet.

It started small. Their daughter, whom Vickey had named Liora (light), started glowing when she giggled — literally. Then came the accidental fireballs, the levitating toys, and once… a minor summoning circle drawn in chocolate pudding on the floor.

“Lucifer,” Vickey called one evening from the nursery. “Why is your daughter summoning a hellhound in her sleep?”

He blinked, completely unbothered, sipping coffee. “Strong bloodline.”

She glared. “She's six months old!”

Still, Lucifer was obsessed. He built her a training crib — lined with sigils to absorb bursts of chaos magic. He handpicked enchanted lullabies sung by ancient sirens and read bedtime stories like ""How to Outwit an Archangel in Three Steps.""

Vickey tried to balance it out with classic baby books and love-filled lullabies, but she couldn’t lie — seeing Lucifer rock their daughter with one wing wrapped around both of them made her heart melt every time.

One day, while Vickey napped, Lucifer sat cross-legged in front of Liora, who now had a habit of floating two inches off the ground when excited.

“Alright, small demon,” he said, holding an apple toy. “If you’re going to be my heir, we start with basics. Step one: charming manipulation.”

Liora blinked.

Lucifer smiled. “Step two: master the art of eyebrow raises. Watch Daddy.”

“Lucifer,” Vickey’s sleepy voice came from the doorway. “She’s a baby, not your political apprentice.”

He turned to her, grinning. “Can’t start too early.”

Vickey rolled her eyes but smiled. She loved seeing this side of him. The king of hell, now wrapped around the tiny fingers of a glowing infant with wings made of light and shadow.

Their home became filled with tiny disasters — floating spoons, magical burps, nap time tantrums that caused mild earthquakes in the villa — but neither of them would trade it for anything.

The baby sighed, curling into her mother’s chest.

“She’s strong,” Vickey whispered.

“She’s ours,” Lucifer said softly. “She’ll burn the world... but she’ll know love first.”

And as they lay together in the silence that followed — Vickey, Lucifer, and their tiny, chaotic flame — they knew something for certain:

The war was over.

But their legacy had just begun.

Although i have multiple hobbies, i think i love programming the most, i’m not great at it but it’s very fun when doing it with my friends and working on a project. I also love collecting antique medals from old wars, i have a small collection of medals, i also used to play tennis but i quit it a while ago.

Winter by a mile, i love winter so much, i don’t even know why, i just like cold and it’s very calm while sitting in your warm home, drinking hot coffee or something and playing games with my family, epic tbh.


I don’t really have a specific hairstyle and i only saw it on myself, it’s a unique one and i tried finding the closest one to it, they look pretty similar but my hair is kinda shorter and darker, with like a twist at the end.

I just wear casual. One white shirt with black pants with a jacket is enough, not too fancy and it’s comfortable so why not.

Definitely Salut by Joe Dassin, one of my favorite songs since childhood and i have so many memories with it, i cannot even explain.

I love African Grey parrots, the one in the picture is mine, his name is Pluto and i love them because they are very fun, smart and very clingy to their owners, they can talk like real humans and it’s really funny.

I don’t really have a type, i’m much more of a personality person and putting it as mbti I’d probably go for infj’s as well as entp’s, based on my experience.",2,1746694933.0,MbtiTypeMe,11,1.0,False

""Mrs. Vanderbilt, the food's gone cold again. Should I reheat it?"" The housekeeper's cautious tone carried a hint of impatience as she glanced at Paisley Sutton.

Paisley sat alone at the large dining table, the vast space around her amplifying her solitude. She glanced at the time and then at the housekeeper, whose frustration was over her face. ""Just clear it away,"" said Paisley with a faint smile that barely masked her weariness.

It was her birthday today, yet neither her husband nor son had bothered to come home. The stark absence of their presence made the silence in the room deafening.

The housekeeper began clearing the table with swift, almost annoyed movements, muttering under her breath, ""Mrs. Vanderbilt, not to be rude, but why go to all this trouble? You knew neither your husband nor your son would be back tonight, yet you insisted on preparing a whole feast.

""Reheating this food three times tonight? It's exhausting. Honestly, as a wife and mother, you're not exactly winning any awards. Otherwise, why would they both avoid you like this?""

""You're right. I've failed spectacularly,"" Paisley replied with a bitter smile. The words stung, but she no longer had the strength to argue. In this house, even the housekeeper had no qualms about being openly dismissive toward her.

She understood that the housekeeper's attitude mirrored the Vanderbilt family's treatment of her. She scoffed internally, 'If my husband and son don't respect me, why would anyone else?'

Seeing Paisley's quiet despair, the housekeeper softened slightly, a flicker of pity crossing her face.

With a sigh, she muttered, ""People always cling to things that don't belong to them. If I were you, I'd let go. Let it all go. You'd be doing yourself a favor—and maybe even others.""

Paisley didn't respond, but the words lingered, sinking deep into her mind like stones dropped into a still pond.

The room remained quiet, save for the clinking of dishes being cleared away. The chandelier overhead cast a soft, golden glow, but it only emphasized how hollow the space felt. Paisley's chest tightened, her heart weighed down by the emptiness she'd grown accustomed to.

The housekeeper finished clearing the table and retreated to her quarters, leaving the vast dining room eerily silent.

Paisley turned off all the lights, her movements slow and deliberate, as if each step required effort.

Cradling the cake box, she climbed the grand staircase and returned to her bedroom. The space was cold, the kind of cold that seeped into her soul rather than her skin.

She settled onto the plush sofa by the window, the moonlight spilling in faintly, casting soft shadows on the walls.

Carefully, she opened the cake box. Inside was a delicately crafted dessert meant for celebration, though the atmosphere couldn't feel less festive.

She removed the cake, placed a single candle on top, and lit it. The flickering flame reflected in her tired eyes in an overwhelming darkness.

Just as she was about to gather her thoughts, a sharp WhatsApp message shattered the silence in the room. The sound was jarring in the quiet space, its abruptness making her heart jump. She hesitantly reached for her phone, only to find it was a video message.

She clicked on it, and the screen revealed a scene from a VIP hospital suite. Her husband, Dominick Vanderbilt, and her young son, Grayson Vanderbilt, sat by the bedside of a gorgeous, frail-looking woman.

Paisley recognized her instantly. It was Marissa Prescott, Dominick's childhood sweetheart, to whom Dominick had once been engaged. This video was from her.

""Dom, I'm so sorry to keep you here so late,"" Marissa's weak voice came through, punctuated by soft, deliberate coughs.

""It's no trouble,"" Dominick replied, his tone warm and gentle, with a tenderness Paisley hadn't heard from him in years. It wasn't just warmth—it was affection, even indulgence.

'So, he's been with her all day,' Paisley thought, a faint, self-deprecating smile curling her lips. She couldn't even remember the last time Dominick had spoken to her without an edge of irritation, let alone with this kind of fondness.

A pang of bitterness twisted in her chest as she wondered when his voice, once a source of comfort, had turned into a weapon. Now, it seemed, every word he directed at her was either critical or cold.

""Marissa, you don't need to worry,"" came Grayson's soft, childlike voice from the video. His small, chubby body crawled up onto the bed, snuggling into Marissa's arms. ""Daddy and I love staying here with you. We don't wanna go home.""

The boy's next words hit like a dagger. ""I love having Marissa around. I wish she was my mommy.""

The video ended abruptly, leaving Paisley staring at the blank screen.

Her hands trembled as she set the phone down. The candle on the cake flickered, its glow dim against the suffocating darkness in the room.

Finally, Paisley made up her mind. She drew a deep breath and blew out the flame. The dimness swallowed the room as her voice broke the silence, soft and almost a whisper. ""Happy birthday to me.""

Dominick returned home well past midnight. The house was shrouded in darkness, an unusual sight. There was always a light left on for him, no matter how late he arrived, but tonight, that small comfort was conspicuously absent.

His brow furrowed with irritation as he handed Grayson off to the housekeeper. Without a word, he strode toward the master bedroom, his steps brisk and sharp. When he noticed the light spilling out from under the door, his grim expression eased slightly.

Inside, Paisley sat upright on the sofa, her posture unnervingly composed. Beside her was a neatly packed suitcase, and on the low coffee table in front of her lay a divorce agreement, stark and unmissable.

Dominick's fleeting relief vanished, replaced by a cold, impenetrable look. His voice was clipped and edged with annoyance. ""Paisley, what is this? Another one of your stunts?""

Paisley could feel the tension between them crackle like static in the air. She didn't have the energy to entertain his accusations, nor did she have the desire to dig into the complicated mess he called a ""stunt"".

She stood her ground, her voice quiet but unwavering, ""Dominick, I want a divorce.""

He sighed heavily, his fatigue evident as he loosened his tie and tossed it onto the sofa. That was when his gaze fell on the small cake sitting on the coffee table, its candle burned down to the wick.

""It's your birthday today?"" His tone carried faint disbelief, laced with a trace of guilt. He'd forgotten, and his assistant hadn't reminded him either.

""It doesn't matter,"" Paisley replied, shaking her head. She pushed the divorce agreement closer to him, her expression unwavering. ""Sign it. Let's end this.""

Dominick's brows drew together, his irritation and confusion flaring as if she were the one making a scene. ""Why?"" he demanded, his tone accusatory. ""Because I forgot your birthday? Don't you think that's a little melodramatic?""

He glanced at the agreement with a hint of mockery in his eyes, and then stretched out two fingers, pinching the paper between them. Slowly, he began flipping through it, one page at a time, as if inspecting it like some trivial document that didn't matter.

He sneered, ""You ask for nothing? You're going to leave empty-handed? Paisley, where would you even go without me?""

A bitter laugh escaped Paisley's lips, though her heart felt heavier with every beat.

'So that's it,' she thought. 'He's so certain that I'm trapped, that I have no one to rely on in Harrowfell, no place to go. That's why he's so confident, so sure he can keep draining me of every last ounce of love and patience.'

Her inner voice hissed with venom, 'What an arrogant, self-satisfied jerk.'

Yet on the outside, Paisley remained eerily calm, her silence more cutting than any retort.

She let out a cold, mirthless laugh. ""Where I go is none of your concern. All you need to do is sign the papers and meet me at the City Hall tomorrow."" Her voice was calm, but the ice in her tone could cut through steel.

At that, Dominick's temper flared, his voice laced with frost. ""Have you really thought this through?""

She didn't bother responding, simply tossing the pen onto the table near his hand. ""Stop wasting time. Sign it.""

Her unwavering resolve struck him like a blow. For a moment, Dominick faltered, his mind clouded with a fleeting sense of unease. Her once-soft eyes now burned with an unyielding determination he hadn't seen before.

Slowly, he drew in a deep breath and massaged his temple, the weariness in his expression growing more pronounced. ""Fine. Divorce it is,"" he said, his tone heavy with frustration. ""But Sonny's custody? That's off the table. You're not taking him.""

Before Paisley could react, a small voice pierced the tension. Grayson had woken at some point and now dashed into the room, clutching Dominick's arm tightly.

He glared at Paisley, his little face twisted with anger as he yelled, ""I'm staying with Daddy. I don't want to go with you. You're a horrible mom. A witch!""

""Sonny,"" Dominick snapped, his voice sharp enough to startle the boy.

But Grayson was undeterred, his tear-streaked face defiant after getting screamed at. ""I'm not wrong,"" he shouted, his words tumbling out in a storm of emotions. ""You're just a useless housewife. Grandma and Aunt Kayla said so.

""If you hadn't come between Daddy and Marissa, she would be my mom right now.""

Pinching the bridge of his nose, Dominick sighed deeply, ""Grayson, enough—""

But Paisley cut him off, her voice slicing through the air like a blade. ""I don't care about Grayson. I don't care about anything. I just want a divorce."" Her tone was final, leaving no room for negotiation or second-guessing.

Dominick's lips tightened into a thin line, his expression hardening in disbelief. He hadn't expected Paisley to say something like that—something so resolute, so cold. To refuse to take Grayson with her after the divorce, after everything she had been through for Grayson, felt unthinkable.

Dominick couldn't forget the sacrifices she had made to bring their son into the world. Paisley had nearly lost her life on the operating table, and afterward, she had poured herself into raising Grayson, tending to him with an intensity that bordered on obsession.

She had given him everything, every part of herself, to make him safe, healthy, and loved. And now, she was simply saying she didn't want him and didn't want anything to do with him.

Even Grayson seemed stunned into silence by her words, his sobs abruptly halting as he stared at her in disbelief. But the shock didn't last long. A twisted smile crept onto his face, one too bitter for a child. ""Good.

""Daddy, hurry up and divorce her. Then Marissa can be my mommy.""

The words hung in the air like poison, choking the remnants of warmth left in the room. Dominick ignored Grayson's outburst entirely, his sharp gaze fixed on Paisley like a predator sizing up its prey.

His voice dropped an octave, cold and commanding. ""I'll ask you one last time—are you absolutely sure about this divorce?""

Paisley met his eyes without flinching, her tone calm yet resolute. ""Yes.""

She watched Dominick's pen carved his name onto the divorce agreement, his movements deliberate yet forceful. Without hesitation, she picked up her copy, the weight of it oddly liberating.

She grabbed her suitcase and headed toward the door. Her voice was steady, but the undercurrent of finality was unmistakable. ""9:00 a.m. tomorrow. City Hall. Don't be late.""

Just as her fingers tightened around the handle of her suitcase, her wrist was seized in a firm grip. Dominick's hand was broad, his veins prominent along the back of it, exuding a raw, masculine allure that once had her utterly captivated.

She'd been obsessed with those hands, with the man they belonged to. But now, his touch felt like repulsive shackles.

""Let go,"" she said icily, her voice stripped of all warmth.

Her thoughts churned bitterly. 'What's the point of clinging now? Isn't this divorce exactly what everyone wanted? Dominick, his family, and the housekeeper seemed eager to see me gone.'

Dominick's lips curled into a mocking smile, his tone laced with dark amusement. ""In such a hurry to leave? What? Got yourself a lover on the side already?""

A wave of exhaustion swept over Paisley, sinking into her very bones. She looked into his eyes, her words cutting through the tension like a knife. ""Dominick, I have never hated you more than I do right now.""

For a moment, her words seemed to shake him. His grip loosened, and he let her wrist slowly slip from his grasp. His tone softened, almost imploring. ""It's late. Even if you're set on leaving, you could wait until morning.""

A dry, humorless laugh escaped her lips. She pulled her hand back, her gaze unwavering.

Without sparing him another glance, she grabbed her suitcase and walked out. The sound of the door closing behind her echoed in the vast emptiness of the house—a house that had imprisoned her for four long years.

Her departure felt like breaking free, but the weight of her pain and disillusionment lingered, trailing behind her like a shadow she couldn't quite shake.

# 2.Chapter 2

The airport buzzed with activity, a symphony of distant announcements, hurried footsteps, and rolling suitcases blending into the steady hum of life. Crowds ebbed and flowed in a rhythm that was both chaotic and strangely orderly.

The cool, filtered air carried faint traces of coffee and jet fuel, grounding Paisley in the reality of her impending departure.

Her flight had begun boarding. Just as she was about to step forward to hand her boarding pass to the attendant, her phone buzzed insistently in her pocket.

She slid her ticket across the counter and answered the call without checking the caller ID. But before she could say a word, Grayson's young voice shrilled through the speaker. ""I want rainbow pasta!""

Paisley paused mid-step, glancing down at the phone. It was Dominick's number.

""There's frozen pasta in the fridge,"" she replied coolly, her voice even and detached. She collected her boarding pass and continued walking toward the gate.

""The nanny said it's all gone."" Grayson's voice climbed in pitch, sharp and grating the way children's voices do when they're on the verge of a tantrum.

Paisley's lips tightened. She'd worked hard to instill discipline in Grayson, especially when it came to shouting or making demands in public. But this naughty boy had his father's stubborn streak, and lately, her corrections only seemed to irritate him further.

Her tone remained indifferent as she replied with a frown, ""Then it's gone.""

""That's not fair,"" Grayson wailed. His voice rose again, teetering on the edge of a full-blown fit. ""Come back right now and make it for me. I want it now.""

Paisley inhaled slowly, her grip on her phone firm but calm. ""Ask your precious Marissa to make it for you,"" she said, her voice laced with an edge that cut through his whining.

The line went silent for a few heartbeats, but it wasn't long before Grayson's crying and howling began in earnest, loud enough that Paisley had to hold the phone slightly away from her ear.

After a muffled scuffle on the other end, Dominick's deep, irritated voice finally came through. ""Paisley, why are you picking a fight with a child? He's just a kid. He doesn't understand.""

By this point, Paisley had stepped into the cabin, her heels clicking softly against the carpeted aisle. She flashed a polite smile at the flight attendant and handed over her handbag before settling into her seat in first class.

Reclining slightly, she adjusted her tone to one of detached finality. ""If a child doesn't understand, then surely the adults should, don't you think?""

Her mind drifted as the seatbelt light blinked on. Grayson hadn't always been this way. Up until the age of two, he'd been a sweet, clingy little boy who adored her, proudly declaring to anyone who'd listen that his mother was the best in the world.

'When did that start to change?' she wondered. The answer came to her with a pang of bitterness. 'It must have been when Marissa came back to Harrowfell.'

Everything Paisley had forbidden, Marissa would indulge. If Paisley said no to candy, Marissa would slip it to him behind her back. If Paisley enforced bedtime rules, Marissa would sneak him out for late-night games.

At first, the Vanderbilt family had always looked down upon Paisley. Slowly but surely, their obvious preference for Marissa over Paisley began to seep into Grayson's perception. In his young, impressionable mind, Paisley had been recast as a villain—a meddling outsider, a scheming woman who broke up the family.

""Dominick,"" Paisley said firmly, ""we're divorced now. There's no reason for us to keep in touch anymore.""

Without waiting for a response, she ended the call and switched off her phone.

As the plane ascended, Paisley stared out the window, the city shrinking beneath her until it was no more than a blur of lights and distant memories.

She took a deep breath, the hum of the engines steadying her frayed nerves. 'It's over,' she thought. 'I've left it all behind.'",1,1746694752.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Spoiler alert: it didn’t.

The drink arrives, drowning in ice and tasting like someone whispered ""coffee"" into a glass of cold water. I asked the barista if something went wrong, and he hits me with:
“Sir, this coffee brews for 18 hours… that’s why it tastes like this.”

Ah yes, the classic longer = worse formula.

I asked if he could maybe fix it. He nodded solemnly, went back, and returned with the same drink now featuring two generous pumps of syrup...

“Sir ab pi ke dekho, theek lagega.”
Bravo, Chef.

Oh and the beans? Had a “manufacturing date” from 2–3 months ago just sitting there like it’s still fresh. Because nothing says specialty coffee like stale beans and sugar shots.

# What is ""Common Sense Consulting (Week 1–50) – Alan Weiss""?

So, what *exactly* is **Common Sense Consulting (Week 1–50) – Alan Weiss**? In a nutshell, it’s a weekly video series where Alan Weiss—yes, *the* Alan Weiss—drops a new bite-sized consulting gem every week for 50 weeks. That’s almost a year of pure, unfiltered wisdom from the consultant who literally *wrote the book* on consulting. Each week you get a five-minute video and an accompanying resource—could be a doc, a chart, even a cheeky joke.

And the kicker? It's super practical. No fluff. No bloated theory. Just smart, actionable ideas that you can use *right now* to level up your consulting business.

# Who is Alan Weiss?

If you don’t know Alan Weiss, you’re probably new to consulting (no shame). He’s the author of “Million Dollar Consulting,” and arguably the godfather of solo consulting success. The guy has been mentoring consultants for decades, charging high-ticket fees, and teaching others how to do the same. And with **Common Sense Consulting (Week 1–50) – Alan Weiss**, he’s distilled a lifetime of know-how into a digestible weekly format.

Basically, imagine having coffee every week with the world’s top consultant—and he drops a new trick each time.

# Why Should You Care?

Because this isn’t just about “working smarter,” it’s about making *more* by doing *less*. You get weekly ideas that improve your positioning, pricing, client management, proposals, negotiation—everything. Weiss doesn’t just want you to be good at consulting—he wants you to *own* it.

At $250 for the full package (yes, that’s $5 a week), it’s a no-brainer investment. Seriously, a single tip from Week 8 or 22 could make you that money back tenfold. If you're a consultant—new, growing, or seasoned—this is like adding rocket fuel to your engine.

1khla7s,https://i.redd.it/evr279vxtize1.jpeg,My feedback after a 11 days / 2881km ring road trip with an electric vehicle in April,"I decided to rent an electric vehicle for my second Icelandic trip on the ring road during April 2025, and I thought I'd give my feedback so it may be useful for people who are considering doing the same.

---

**Facts and numbers**

- **Car type:** Opel Corsa 2023 with a 50Kwh battery
- **Total distance:** 2881km (1790mi)

---

**Charges**

I always charged up to 80% battery max, except when I could use a free charger at hotels where I went for 100%.
I mostly used fast charging stations with a cost of 59 to 69 ISK par kWh.
Here is the list of my charges:

- Charger type: eONE
    - 13.8 kWh / 386 ISK
    - 1 kWh / 28 ISK (the charge failed after a few seconds, had to relaunch)
    - 25.8 kWh / 1522 ISK
- Charger type: ON
    - 17.2 kWh / 724 ISK
    - 24.1 kWh / 1662 ISK
    - 27 kWh / 1865 ISK
    - 15.1 kWh / 1043 ISK
    - 14 kWh / 965 ISK
    - 1.1 kWh / 78 ISK (the charge failed after a few seconds, had to relaunch)
    - 28.2 kWh / 1948 ISK
    - 22.8 kWh / 1575 ISK
    - 0.3 kWh / 20 ISK (the charge failed after a few seconds, had to relaunch)
    - 15.1 kWh / 1045 ISK
- Charger type: Tesla
    - 17 kWh / 1003 ISK
    - 23 kWh / 1334 ISK
    - 23 kWh / 1334 ISK
- Charger type: Ísorka
    - 18.2 kWh / 729 ISK
    - 19.2 kWh / 478 ISK
    - 23.4 kWh / 1405 ISK
    - 5.59 kWh / 195 ISK
    - 34.7 kWh / 1214 ISK
    - 25.6 kWh / 614 ISK
- Charger type: Hotel for free
    - 40 kWh / 0 ISK
    - 40 kWh / 0 ISK
    - 30 kWh / 0 ISK

- **Total charged:** 510 kWh
- **Total cost:** 21,167 ISK

---

**Cost**

I paid a total of 21,167 ISK to drive 2881 km, which gives a 7.35 ISK per km cost.
If I had chosen a fuel vehicle it would have cost me 2 to 3 times the price as per my calculation:
- 28.81 (km) * 315 (ISK) * 5 = 45,375 ISK given a 5 liters per 100km efficiency
- 28.81 (km) * 315 (ISK) * 7 = 63,526 ISK given a 7 liters per 100km efficiency

Data shows that the price is unbeatable, if I am not mistaken?

---

**Charging**

The charge from 30% to 80% took about 30 minutes.
Almost each time I had to charge the car there was a coffee shop or a supermarket I went to shop and use the bathroom, and the charge was already over before I finished what I was doing.
The few times I charged in the middle of nowhere, I took time to eat and relax while enjoying the scenery.

---

**Pain points**

The biggest pain point I can remember was the drive between Mývatn and Egilsstaðir: I charged up to 100% at my hotel in Mývatn and arrived at Egilsstaðir with less than 20% battery capacity remaining. There was no charging station between those 2 cities, so I highly suggest doing the same and loading up the battery to a 100%.
The temperature during the drive was between -3°C (26°F) and 0°C (32°F), so I guess it does not help with the battery usage either but I am not an expert.

Slight inconvenience only: I used a total of 4 apps to be able to charge my EV: having to create an account and link my credit card to each app is a bit annoying.
I think that the situation will inevitably improve and at the end all-in-one apps will eventually come up.

The last one is about the car: I did not find much model options at rental companies, it was either a Tesla or an Opel Corsa.
I chose an Opel Corsa, and I found the system very old fashion / outdated:
- It was a pain to find how to display battery percentage instead of a gas tank gauge
- There was no option to automatically stop the charge at 80%
- The Android auto link was buggy and kept disconnecting

After using a Volkswagen ID.3 in my previous trip in Norway last September, the Opel seemed like a 10 years set-back.

---

**Conclusion**

I am glad I opted for an EV for this trip: cost-wise, charging has been way cheaper than using gas while also being better for the environment. It is a win-win for me.
It would be even better if more hotels were equiped with chargers, and I hope it will be the case for my next trip!",11,1746694006.0,VisitingIceland,4,0.92,False

I came from a household where everything felt heavy. You wake up and it’s either someone yelling, someone guilt tripping you or someone reminding you that you owe them your whole existence just because they raised you. I got tired of it. I didn’t want to just survive in a house that felt more like a cage than a home.

So I left.

I didn’t have much. Just a couple thousand pesos and a few basics. My first bed was just a kutson on the floor. One fan. A couple of plates. I ate instant noodles on the floor and slept listening to random YouTube videos just so I wouldn’t feel the silence too hard.

But you know what? That silence started to feel like peace.

It’s been years now. I live in a small studio. Nothing fancy. Some of my furniture is still secondhand. I have a few plants, some LED lights and a fridge that’s mostly filled with iced coffee and leftovers. I don’t always cook. I rarely go out. But I’m content. No one is shouting. No one is watching over my shoulder. No one is making me feel like I’m not enough.

People sometimes ask me if I get lonely.
Honestly? Not really. I’m alone yes but I’m not lonely. There’s a difference.

Being alone means I finally have space to breathe. To think. To rest. I have peace. I’m healing. I’m not where I want to be yet but I’m far from where I came from. And that’s something I’m quietly proud of.

So if you’re living alone too starting from scratch figuring things out you’re not weird or selfish or broken. You’re just choosing yourself. And that’s not something you ever need to apologize for.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------

I love you mother

But you are blinded too easily.

Why does the cub

Have to save the 

Mama Bear?

/

When stepdad was drinking

Wine bottles 

Whole,

He saw himself on the porch of a farmhouse,

Drinking freshly brewed coffee

Made with beans from 

Arabica trees.

/

When that man 

Slashed your tires,

He imagined himself in a field,

Harvesting grains and vegetables

With a light weighted and sharp sickle.

/

When he kicked our door in,

He felt as if he was in a barn,

Kicking the feed bag over

For the livestock to satisfy their hunger.

/

Maybe,

You began seeing that too.

/

You grew comfortable in that inferno.

You were ignorant of his ill-will.

You forced me to mature,

And pick the lock to the jail cell he had locked us in,

That you had the key to.

/

I refused to submit,

And let us starve and stagnate in that pit

While he was pissing on us.

So I put a target on my back.

I forced the government to give chase,

And led them to our Alcatraz.

/

Prosperity endorses those who dare.

I am a visionary,

And a first-mover.

We would have died if not for me.

Maybe physically,

But certainly spiritually.

/

I love you mother,

But that shouldn’t have been me.

You are still in a deep hole of debt,

And once again

The cub

Will have to save

people often say that coffee is the cause for stress and anxiety, and thats why they want to quit. But my theory is that a person is already stress and probably has underlaying issues and when you start drinking caffeine, it gets much much worse. Same can be said for any other drugs. As an example in a far far past, when i smoked weed when i was angry or upset it would not be a fun experience. On the other hand if i was in a happy state, it would be awesome. 

Does anyone think this might be true, and therefore its not all to blame on caffeine.. how we feel after 3/4 cups of coffee.

After killing my 17th houseplant (RIP Fernando the fern, we hardly knew ye), my friends staged what they called a ""plant intervention.""

\----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# First Impressions

When the AeroGarden Harvest Elite arrived I was terrified I might somehow break it before even getting it out of the box. ""Don't worry,"" I whispered to the package, ""I've watched at least three gardening YouTube videos. I’m practically an experts now.""

The stainless steel finish immediately made my kitchen look about 30% fancier, which is saying something considering the rest of my appliances are in that special category of ""inherited from someone else who’s just bought an upgrade."" 

Setting it up was pretty easy. It's basically foolproof (which I took as a personal challenge.)

I filled the reservoir with water, popped in the seed pods that came with the kit (basil, parsley, dill, thyme, mint, and something called ""Thai basil"" which sounds exotic enough to make me feel trendy), added the plant food, and set the timer. Then came the weirdest part - I just... walked away? This felt like cheating at gardening, but not complaining.

The LED grow light is bright enough that my kitchen now resembles a small-scale alien abduction scene. The first night, I woke up in the night, stumbled into the kitchen for water, and nearly had a heart attack when I saw the purple-blue glow. For a solid five seconds, I was convinced either aliens had finally come for me or my refrigerator had achieved sentience. Neither scenario seemed great for my security deposit.

By day 3, I was checking on my garden with the same obsessive frequency that new parents check their baby monitors. ""Are they sprouting yet? Is that a leaf? OH MY GOD IT'S A LEAF!"" I texted pictures to friends who, until this point, had only received plant funeral announcements from me. Their shock was palpable. My mother called to ask if I was feeling alright.

Within a week, actual visible plants were growing. ME. GROWING PLANTS. This is like a fish suddenly learning to ride a bicycle. I started referring to myself as ""Farmer Sofia"" and making casual references to my crops in conversation. Nobody was impressed, but I didn't care.

# Key Features

**The LED grow light system.** It’s basically plant sunscreen in reverse. Instead of blocking harmful rays, it's beaming down the perfect spectrum of light to make your plants think they're living it up in some tropical paradise rather than next to your coffee maker. The 20-watt LEDs combine white, red, and blue light in a way that apparently makes plants grow up to five times faster than in soil. I can confirm this works somehow.

**The hydroponic growing system.** eliminates soil entirely, which means no mess, no pests, and no accidentally spilling dirt on your white rug when you're trying to water your plants after two glasses of wine.

**The digital control panel.** So user-friendly makes smartphones seem complicated. It tells you exactly when to add water and nutrients with illuminated reminders that are impossible to ignore. There's even a vacation mode for when you abandon your plant children to go sit on a beach somewhere. Nice. 

**Seed pod kit.** comes with the AeroGarden, it’s like a starter pack for plant parenthood. Each pod contains pre-seeded grow sponges, so you don't have to mess around with tiny seeds that inevitably end up everywhere except where they're supposed to be. The plastic domes that go over each pod create a mini greenhouse effect that had me feeling like a mad scientist. ""RISE, MY PRETTIES, RISE!"" I may have shouted once or twice. The neighbors have questions.

**Adjustable grow height.** means your light can rise up to 12 inches as your plants grow taller. This is crucial because without it, your plants would eventually press against the lights. My basil got so ambitious it needed this adjustment after just three weeks. I've never been so proud of something I didn't actually do myself. 

# Pros

* **The ""no soil"" aspect.** This cannot be overstated in its brilliance. As someone who has managed to get potting soil in her hair, under her fingernails, in her coffee, and once inexplicably in her bra, the clean nature of hydroponics is great. My countertops remain spotless, my manicure intact, and my dignity somewhat preserved.

* **Consistent results.** This make me feel like I've finally cracked some secret gardening code. Every single seed pod sprouted. ALL OF THEM. In my previous gardening attempts, I considered a 10% germination rate a rousing success. Now I'm swimming in herbs. Last week I made pesto FROM MY OWN BASIL. I texted everyone I know about it. My ex blocked me, but it was worth it.

* **Year-round growing capability.** Still early days, but I’m hoping my seasonal depression is about to turn into year-round smugness. In February, while everyone else was staring dejectedly at snow and barren trees, I was harvesting fresh mint for mojitos. In my kitchen. In my pajamas.

* **Kinda educational.** Watching plants grow from seed to harvest has given me a new appreciation for the growing process. I now understand why my previous plants died (it was me, I was the problem). The AeroGarden is like having training wheels for amateurs like me. I've learned about pruning, harvesting, and the importance of not touching the plants every five minutes to see if they've grown (they don't like that).

* **Conversation starter.** Having this on my counter has replaced my personality at dinner parties. ""Yes, I grew these herbs myself. No, there's no dirt involved. Yes, I'll tell you all about hydroponics for the next 45 minutes."" People are either fascinated or desperately looking for escape routes. Either way, I'm talking about something other than my failed dating life, so it's a win.

# Cons

* **The price.** You could buy a lot of herbs from the grocery store for the cost of this system. 

* **Replacement pods.** They add up cost-wise if you get hooked and want to try different varieties. 

* **The light.** It’s BRIGHT and runs for 15+ hours a day. My kitchen now glows at night. I've had to explain to multiple people that no, I'm not growing something else, just really enthusiastic about basil.

* **Water pump.** It makes a slight humming noise that you might notice when everything else is silent. It's not loud enough to be a real problem, but just noticeable enough.

# Final Verdict

Overall, I'd say the AeroGarden Harvest Elite is pretty cool.

It's probably not ideal for people on tight budgets, those sensitive to light, people with very limited counter space (it's not huge, but it's not small either), or anyone who derives pleasure from the tactile experience of soil gardening (not me).

Is it worth it? If you're like me, curious but horticulturally challenged, then yeah. I've had my AeroGarden for three months now, and I've harvested enough herbs to flavor every meal, make friends with my local pizza delivery guy by sending him home with fresh basil, and develop a slightly concerning obsession with different varieties of mint.

The system has paid for itself in both herbs and self-esteem. For the first time in my life, I'm keeping plants alive. And they're thriving. They're practically showing off at this point.

1khkyqb,https://www.reddit.com/r/aircanada/comments/1khkyqb/13hour_flight_without_water/,13-hour flight without water,"Long story short, we were told about 20 minutes before boarding our 13-hour transpacific Air Canada flight that there would be no water on the plane.

This meant no tea or coffee, but also NO running water in the washrooms to wash our hands. First class bathrooms had a handful of small alcohol wipes, but nothing for the other washrooms.

We had a few minutes to rush to buy some bottled water and, for those of us who drink hot water (This was a flight to Asia), we had to beg the nearby airport coffee shop to fill our mugs (Thankfully we brought them) with hot water, which we then rationed through the 13 hours that followed.

Needless to say this was not an enjoyable experience. Not having hot water to drink, and not being able to wash our hands (incredibly unhygienic) for such a long flight is hardly acceptable.

I was expecting some kind of contact/email from AC afterwards for compensation, but so far nothing at all.

Have any of you experienced this before? Should we reach out to customer service and ask for some sort of compensation?

Edit: I am shocked at the downvotes this is getting. Do people not believe our story? Or is it that you think this is not worthy of compensation? I’m genuinely curious.",0,1746692547.0,aircanada,22,0.48,False
