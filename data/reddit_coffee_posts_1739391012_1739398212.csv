# üîó¬†[MetaChain: Natural Language-Based Framework for Automated LLM Agent Development and Deployment:](https://aimodels.fyi/papers/arxiv/metachain-fully-automated-zero-code-framework-llm)

MetaChain introduces a fully automated framework for creating LLM-based agents using natural language instructions instead of code. The core innovation is a three-layer architecture that handles agent creation, task execution, and safety monitoring while enabling continuous self-improvement.

Key technical aspects:

* Meta Layer translates natural language to agent specifications using advanced prompt engineering
* Chain Layer manages task decomposition and execution through recursive skill acquisition
* Safety Layer implements real-time monitoring and ethical constraints
* Multi-agent coordination system allows dynamic collaboration between agents
* Novel ""recursive self-improvement"" mechanism for automatic skill development

Results from their evaluation:

* 92% success rate in zero-code agent creation tasks
* 45% performance improvement over baseline frameworks
* 98% effectiveness in preventing harmful actions
* 30% performance increase through self-improvement
* 40% better resource efficiency vs traditional approaches

I think this could significantly lower the barrier to entry for creating AI agents. While the resource requirements might limit adoption by smaller teams, the zero-code approach could enable rapid prototyping and deployment of specialized agents across various domains. The safety-first architecture also addresses some key concerns about autonomous agents.

The framework still has limitations with specialized domain knowledge and edge cases, and the scalability of self-improvement needs more investigation. However, the results suggest a viable path toward more accessible agent development.

TLDR: New framework enables zero-code creation of LLM agents through natural language, with built-in safety measures and self-improvement capabilities. Shows strong performance improvements over baselines but has some limitations with specialized tasks.

Her iqos cigarette butts are behind every couch and bed no matter how many times I clean it!

Then the lying. No matter how many times I catch her lying and try to tell her that honesty is a number 1 rule in a relationship she just rolls her eyes and continues. It goes as far as her saying something rude to someone and when I try to explain that you shouldn‚Äôt speak like that to someone she says oh but I didn‚Äôt say that‚Ä¶ 

Racist remarks in the house and the public. It‚Äôs so embarrassing. Rude to old people. Extremely judgemental. 

She is very entitled and has had everything given to her. She studied for years and worked her dream job but still complains how she hates to work and is never satisfied 

I invested a little over 40k usd to she could take her practice independently and 2 years later instead of being a business partner I am pathetic and unemployed. Ever since I stopped being involved in her business it is not doing as well. She even had police come pick her up from the house for salary fraud investigation. Not a single thank you just more lies 

I asked her many times not to feed the dog. The next day she takes a full box of raw heavy garlic sausages and gives it all to the dog. She got poisoned and we had her on IV for couple days and she died in my arms

I met this guy in late November, and we hit it off immediately. From our first date, we started going out three times a week and talking on the phone for hours in between. He‚Äôs smart, understanding, and very accepting of my 4-year-old daughter, despite never having dated someone with a child before.

I‚Äôm American, and he‚Äôs Nigerian, so it‚Äôs been fun introducing him to American culture and learning about his. He moved here for his master‚Äôs degree, which he completed in Michigan, and now we both live in Iowa, where he got his first job. However, on January 6, his company put him on an involuntary leave due to financial issues (he works in the EV trucking industry). Since he‚Äôs on a work visa, they didn‚Äôt officially lay him off, but it was essentially the same thing. Despite only knowing him for about six weeks at the time, I used my network to help him get interviews, and he eventually landed a great job in Dallas. We talked about doing long distance, and since I have a flexible job that allows me to work remotely, I was open to visiting.

Everything seemed great‚Ä¶ until last Tuesday. After I took him out to celebrate his new job, he dropped me off and casually mentioned that his ex-girlfriend was coming to town and staying with him for five days that weekend.

For context, when he moved from Michigan, she was supposed to move in with him, but he changed his mind last minute, and they broke up. While in Iowa, he spent his first eight months driving her mom‚Äôs car, and some of her belongings were still at his place. Now that he‚Äôs relocating to Dallas, she was coming to pick up her things‚Äîincluding the car, which he was paying to have shipped back to Michigan.

I had immediate concerns:
	‚Ä¢	He lives in a one-bedroom apartment, and I can‚Äôt imagine she had so much stuff that it would take five days to pack.
	‚Ä¢	He originally told me he had been renting an old friend‚Äôs car month-to-month, not that he was still driving his ex‚Äôs mom‚Äôs car.
	‚Ä¢	He claimed he didn‚Äôt know the exact dates she was coming because he paid for her flight, but why not just pay to ship the car with her stuff instead?
	‚Ä¢	He only told me on Wednesday, when she was arriving on Saturday, which felt like he was springing it on me last minute.

I suggested he stay at my place overnight while spending the day helping her pack, but he insisted that wouldn‚Äôt make a difference because, ‚ÄúIf I wanted to cheat, I could do it no matter what.‚Äù He reassured me over and over that there was nothing romantic there and that they weren‚Äôt even friends‚Äîjust connected by the car. He even swore that once the car was gone, they‚Äôd be done for good.

I wanted to trust him‚Ä¶ but then Saturday night happened. I found out he took her out to bars that night. That was my breaking point. I felt like he was talking to me way less than usual in those 24 hours, and it just didn‚Äôt sit right with me. So, on Sunday, I blocked him on everything.

Twelve hours later, he messaged me on Facebook (where we weren‚Äôt even friends) saying, ‚ÄúIf I acted in any way to disrespect you, may all the curses of the Bible fall on me.‚Äù But honestly, I feel like even letting an ex stay with you for five days like they‚Äôre family or a close friend is disrespectful enough. He insists this is just a ‚Äútest of trust‚Äù we need to overcome.

I eventually unblocked him on WhatsApp and offered to meet his ex at a coffee shop to clear the air. He said she refused and wanted to stay out of it. I showed up anyway, just in case he came‚Äîbut neither of them did. That was last Tuesday. Now it‚Äôs Wednesday afternoon, and I feel like I have a hole in my heart.

Even in such a short time, he became my best friend. We talked about everything for hours every day. He took care of me when I was extremely sick with influenza B, helped me buy my first new car, and started going to church with me and my daughter every Sunday. Our friends liked each other, and we were even talking about meeting each other‚Äôs families.

Now I‚Äôm stuck between logic and my heart. On one hand, it‚Äôs only been three months, and maybe I should just walk away. On the other hand, I fell for him fast‚Äîby the end of December, I already felt like I was in love.

So‚Ä¶ was I wrong for blocking him before fully hearing him out? Or should I take this as my sign to move on?",2,1739397911.0,AmIOverreacting,2,1.0,False

I‚Äôm going to preface this by saying I know I have a low pain tolerance, so when I say a 5/10 to me, it‚Äôs probably a 3-4 to most.

I have been having occasional achey/crampy back pain (probably 4/10 pain) for a few months, maybe once a week. I noticed it more frequently when I drank coffee first thing in the morning, so I just stopped drinking coffee and haven‚Äôt had other issues

I got sick with the flu about 10 days ago (not confirmed, but multiple people I travelled with a few days prior tested positive for Flu). I‚Äôm vaxxed and my flu symptoms only lasted about 4 days, mostly malaise and respiratory symptoms. During that time I had one bout of back pain, shortly after eating soup. It was made of only a 15 bean mix, frozen veggies, low sodium chicken broth, and herbs (not fatty like you‚Äôd usually expect with gallstones). The back pain was achey with 6/10 pain; I also felt nauseous and was burping.

For the last 5 days I have consistently had one episode each day of 5-6/10 back pain in the lumbar region that is sometimes accompanied by nausea and burping. The back pain is the main symptom and lasts a few hours; nausea is pretty mild, and I will burp maybe 5-6 times over the course of 1-2 hours (as opposed to once every few days). It has started somewhere around 9a-12p every day.

I don‚Äôt know if we‚Äôre breaking or just bending, but either way, it scares me. ‚ÄúYou look like someone trying to solve a problem,‚Äù a voice says.

I glance up. It‚Äôs the old man who‚Äôs always here gray hair, worn leather jacket, black coffee. We‚Äôve never spoken, but today, he‚Äôs watching me like he already knows. I let out a breath. ‚ÄúYeah. Relationships are complicated.‚Äù He chuckles. ‚ÄúAren‚Äôt they always?‚Äù He takes a slow sip of his coffee, then sets it down. ‚ÄúLet me guess you‚Äôre trying to fix something that feels like it‚Äôs slipping away.‚Äù

I nod, surprised by how much that one sentence holds. He leans forward. ‚ÄúMost people, when love starts feeling like it‚Äôs breaking, focus on what‚Äôs wrong. But the real trick? Remember why it worked in the first place.‚Äù His words settle into me.

‚ÄúYou mean‚Ä¶ instead of focusing on the problems, I should focus on what made us fall in love?‚Äù ‚ÄúExactly.‚Äù He taps the side of his cup. ‚ÄúThe fights, the stress, the things that feel so big right now they matter.

My CTO job description at a glance.,"Are you sitting in the gutter right now looking up at the C-Suite stars? If so, I've got the inside scoop for all fellow tech nerds on what a CTO actually does all day.

I'm not just talking here about always showing up rocking a crisp shirt and dishing out snacks at meetings - though that never hurts. I've seen guys that have clambered out of the trenches to Chief Technology Officer glory - and others who can't even reprogram the break room microwave.

So, let me break down for you everything a CTO should be (at least in theory):

**Visionary technobabbler**

Just tossing around phrases like ""blue sky thinking"" won't cut it. If you're going to be a CTO the buck stops with you when explaining to the board exactly why you need a bajillion dollars to install that shiny new AI system on everyone's workstations. 

My pro tip: Throw in some 'Treknobabble' to dazzle the board then make a swift exit before anyone can ask for explanations. 

**Translator supreme**

Sure you can sometimes BS your way out of trouble with tech jargon. However, you also need to translate between 'Geek' and 'Suit' fluently. That means one minute you might be delving into thousands of lines of code with the development team. Next, you might be on the links patiently explaining to the CEO why ""just adding more blockchain"" won't magically solve every corporate issue.

**Fighting fires**

When the $#! hits the fan - and believe me it will - guess who gets the call? Yep, it's you. You don't get to switch off your corporate cell phone and relax by the pool, as at any moment your organization's at risk of a massive data breach. Or perhaps it's just Dave in accounting who's accidentally deleted the entire customer database - again. Either way, every minute offline costs big so grab your hose and dive in.

**Talent whisperer**

I've left this one 'til last as some of the bigger firms I've worked with spare the CTO from headhunting and doing interviews so he could focus on all the amazing tech stuff I've touched on above. 

If you're a CTO at a startup or SMB though, you'll probably be tasked with finding and keeping all the local tech talent. This is about as easy as herding cats - if the cats could code in their sleep and know that Google has better treats.

Now, at this stage you might well be thinking:

""Well this doesn't sound so bad, I could do all that stuff, boss a few guys around then return to my desk and play with my Newton's cradle all day."" 

Oh you sweet summer child! The reality is as a CTO of course you'll get to play with gadgets. That's a key part of the role. Still, beyond the shiny toys you also have to make key decisions that can make or break your organization.

Still, despite the occasional lack of gadgetry, coming in on Sundays, and the inevitable gray hairs, it can be a pretty rewarding gig. 

You're not Tony Stark, who builds robot suits every five minutes (as cool as that would be) but you do shape major tech decisions at your company. You also are never alone, as you often get to train up and mentor the next generation of tech wizards.

So, what's the most important thing a CTO does? From what I've seen, it has nothing to do with the expensive toys and putting out fires. It's about having the vision to see how technology can solve business problems, then have the cojones to make it happen.

Still, that's my two cents. What do you say it takes to be a kick-ass CTO? Strategy planning? Team leadership? Coffee bribes? Sheer willpower? Let's hear it in the comments.",1,1739397469.0,TheCTOClub,0,1.0,False
1io2xya,https://www.reddit.com/r/covidlonghaulers/comments/1io2xya/nicotine_patches_cautiously_optimistic/,Nicotine patches - cautiously optimistic,"First off - I was a pack to pack-and-a-half cigarette smoker, but quit 50 years ago. I should also mention that I am highly suggestible so I'm always on the lookout for things that might be attributed to the placebo effect.

I've tried lots of stuff, with little to no results. I started using 3.5mg patches (half of a 7mg Step 3 patch) and after five days I was feeling noticeably better. My Kaiser NorCal LC specialist said they don't usually recommend them, but since I was already using them and feeling better I could continue, with the caveat that I not go above 7.5mg.

Starting Jan. 31st, I used 3.5mg patches for 6 days, took a day off, and then stepped up to 7mg. (I'm taking today off, too, FWIW.) At first, I was taking the patch off before bedtime, concerned that it might affect my sleep, but after experimenting with leaving it on or taking it off, it doesn't seem to make much difference. So I've been leaving them on for 24 hrs.

I use the Visible app and armband to monitor my energy expenditure. For those not familiar with it, it's a pacing app that tracks your heart rate.  Once you've set up the app, it gives you a ""pace"" budget, and keeps track of how much rest, activity and exertion you use throughout the day. It's a bit like the ""spoons"" theory, if you're familiar with that.

My Visible ""Pace Points Budget"" is 19. Last Friday, Feb. 7, I had an insanely busy day, lots of driving, walking across campus, presenting an in-person guest lecture, talking to students afterwards for over half an hour, running a few errands on my way home. Completely blew out my Pace Budget of 19 points - **I did 103.5 points!** Normally, this would have caused a HUGE crash. The next day (Saturday), I felt kind of exhausted (but not crashy), the next day, about the same. Monday, lots of physical effort, lots of mental effort - **61.4** points!

These were by far the highest numbers I've had since I starting using Visible around Thanksgiving. And just four days apart! A typical ""too high"" day for me would be around 35 Pace Points, so I should have had a big crash. Not so far.

I considered myself a coffee connoisseur, but I gave up coffee when I developed LC in late 2023. I never completely lost my sense of smell and taste, but they were noticeably diminished. The middle of last week, I had received a freshly roasted batch of coffee from a roaster whose product I'd never had before. I brewed up a batch, took a sip of my wife's coffee, and it practically *exploded* in my mouth. I said to my wife, ""Oh my god, that's really good coffee, isn't it!"" She agreed.

This morning, I brushed my teeth and was shocked at how minty my toothpaste was. 

I know everything about this malady can go up and down, be sporadic, and temporary, but as the subject line says, I'm cautiously optimistic.

Tomorrow, I'm going to go down to the pool and swim for the first time in many months. Just a short swim - 200 yards max. if I'm feeling okay.",2,1739397353.0,covidlonghaulers,0,1.0,False

So, first order of business: I think Staten Island pigeons are in on something. Like, they‚Äôre not just birds. They‚Äôve seen things. They know things. The other day, I was walking to class, and this pigeon? Bro, it made eye contact with me‚Äîheld it for a solid three seconds. That‚Äôs too long. That‚Äôs a socially uncomfortable amount of time for a bird to look at you. You know what it did next? It flew straight at my face. Not over me, not around me. AT ME. That was a *message*, man.

Speaking of problems‚Äîwhy do people in coffee shops always look like they have life figured out?

Alright, serious question: If you had to fistfight one historical figure, who would it be?

But this isn‚Äôt always the case, sometimes a parent or parents will abuse the power that they have to  abuse and neglect a child and unfortunately this is something that happens more often then most people realize. The story that I‚Äôm about to tell is at times traumatic and the pain still lingers but this is my story.     

I was born in a small town in central Indiana May 1997 to my mother 20 and father 26, I was there 2nd child i had an older brother . Around this time my dad was in the army but not long after he joined the navy he had a track record of resisting arrest and dealing drugs present even before I was born. The illegal activities he engaged in  were consistent even now . When I was a year and a half we lived in a trailer outside of town of corse it was filthy and the room my brother and I shared was littered with dog poop and soaked in pee . My father would deal drugs out of the trailer and one of the men who would stop by was a man named Brock who was a close friend of my dads and there was another man but his name is lost to my memory. At times the 3 of them would play cards and drink together well one night they were playing around with a gun  it‚Äôs unclear who shot and why it happened but Brock was shot and died . Both my father and the unnamed man where not charged for any wrongdoing in Brock‚Äôs death and life went on like it never happened.  

Skip forward I was two years old and we still lived in the trailer and of corse my dad was dealing a large amount of weed and pills. One day I was playing with my toys and I knocked over a bag he had on the coffee table spilling a half pound of weed along with a fine powder, this is the first time I remember being physically abused he punched me in the stomach and slapped me around until I peed myself and my nose was bleeding i remember crying for my mom to save me she was at work. 

For a time my uncle stayed with us , he slept with knives in his bed and for some reason when he moved out we were given the same bed to sleep in. He forgot one of his knives and while I was sleeping i rolled onto it and it stabbed me in my lower back leaving a very nasty scar that sometimes still aches.

My father was sent to navy basic training at the academy in the Great Lakes all the while we moved out of the trailer and temporarily into my grandmothers house . She was a sweet lady sometimes stubborn but genuinely cared about us. Time passed and my father finnished basic training and we were sent to meridian Mississippi l. He developed a bad drinking habit and a love for wwe while in Mississippi. The base commander was part of a notorious racist group and my dad being himself made friends with them and would invite them over for fires and cookouts while they where dressed in what resembled to me at the time ghost costumes. 

In 2001 we moved to San Diego California while we lived here he breed pitbulls and sold them on the side for extra money , some of his customers where involved in dog fighting rings but he sold to them regardless for extra money. Not long after moving to California we were sent inland to a small town near Fresno. We lived in a circle neighborhood surrounded by several homes with other kids. My dad would host party‚Äôs where alcohol was available to these same kids some where as young as 6. I am uncertain why we moved to a town less than 10 miles away but i believe it was something to do with one of our pitbulls killing a neighbors dog and him trying to cover it up as a hit and run gone wrong. 

The new house we moved was actually closer to the school I went to  but there were fewer kids. Across the street there was a highly religious couple with 2 kids that would watch us after school they where a bit odd and would sometimes speak in tongues or run outside naked drunk but that was relatively tame compared to things happening at home. Around this time my dads drinking problem got extremely bad he would make me and my older brother fight for his entertainment and sometimes if he thought we weren‚Äôt hitting hard enough he would join in and beat us up these fights would happen when wwe wasn‚Äôt on . A common occurrence when he would drink would be him thinking someone stole his beer so he would chase us down and beat us up. 

Something that haunts me to this day happened one summer night my father was drinking ,he told us to dig a hole and it ended up being big enough for both me and my brother to fit in but it wasn‚Äôt ment for us . The hole was ment for our dog my dad made us lay this healthy dog down in the  and made us watch him execute one of our family pets. The smell the twitching the sounds all of it is burned into my memory I feel sorrow for this poor baby. 

On another one of his drunken episodes he had us invite our friends over for a sleepover and convinced us to skinny dip with him the oldest was a 14 year old boy . I believe he was watching us for some sort of gratification , our friends had a troubled home with parents addicted to substances I‚Äôm sure this played a factor in how bold he was. 

Months later he was drinking yet again , he was arguing with my mom he hit her she hit him then he grabbed his gun and chased he with it, i feared for my moms life so i did the only thing a 7 year old can do i called the police and told them what was happening they told me to stay on the line but i was afraid that if i was caught on the phone with them i would be next so i hung up and hide until it was over. He never shot her but the gun was loaded safety was off and he did have it pointed at her I believe if I didn‚Äôt call the police he would have killed us maybe not that night but some time not long after. The police showed up arrested him and questioned us and I told them everything. I‚Äôm not sure why but my mom bonded him out maybe because of fear but he grilled me for what I told the police for the upcoming court case but I told him nothing so he beat me violently demanding what I told them . I went to school the next day and cops was going to take me my brother and my younger sisters who where babies at the time . The religious neighbor across the street worked for cps and tipped my mom off so she fled the state with us just hours before cops would arrive . In doing so she retained us kids and fled the state where she was the primary witness in an attempted murder case . Because she fled he got a lesser charge and was given a year of probation a few sort months later. 
 
We fled to Indiana where most of our family lived and where taken in to live with my grandmother again, life seemed better and our grandmother showed us love that we had to that point not experienced  it was surreal. We were able to experience a short childhood while we lived with her but good things don‚Äôt last forever. The very next year right before my 9th birthday the Parole office allowed my dad to transfer to Indiana .

When he transferred back he was in the process of being discharged for the military not honorable or dishonorable but was still able to use his military status to take out lones for a 2 story 4 bedroom home and 3 apartment buildings, his plan was to rent them out for cash to pay for legal fees and make a passive income only issue was all 3 apartments where in bad shape and needed new shingles/ drywall. Before we started work restoring the apartment while on probation he was high / drunk/ and took pills ,climbed up a tree 30 to grab a raccoon that was perched on a limb . This didn‚Äôt end well the chain lock he was using wasn‚Äôt ment for climbing so he fell 30 feet breaking his hip a a rib  and broke his arm in 2 places. He nearly died from the fall but even this didn‚Äôt change his corse.immediately after his accident he forced my brother who was 11 and myself who was 9 to work on his apartment buildings and when we failed to work like grown men in his words he beat us with a Cain. He ended up hiring people he was selling weed and pills to  for the job and they did a shorty job Which he blamed us for since we weren‚Äôt good enough. He even treated one of the men he sold drugs to like a son and would have him punch us for a quick laugh.

Although a lot of work was done and the apartment where still in bad shape he started renting them out to drug addicts and people that where desperate as to take advantage of them , he would sometimes make people pay rent twice a month threatening violence if they didn‚Äôt compile. One of the worst things he ever did happened one day in summer I was 10 and my younger sisters where 4,2 and my brother was 12. Our 4 year old sister spilt a whole bottle of shampoo on the carpet he found out first and all he saw was red , he started punching my brother violently I tryed to stop him and he replied your next so I ran to my room ,he followed kicked the door in and proceeded to beat me up until I peed myself then said to me did you just piss yourself!!! Which must have made him angrier because he started punching me harder all I thought at that moment was I‚Äôm going to die. But he stoped after he threw me into the wall and called me worthless. He then demanded we pack are bags and planed to drop us off at foster care but it‚Äôs was a bluff. He did drop my 4 year old sister off on the highway for 15 minutes alone and I can‚Äôt forgive him for that.

Due to us not having a stable income the bank foreclosed on our house and we had a sub pump issue that flooded the basement, he wanted my brother and me to go down there and grab all the stuff out  there was 22 inches of water and it was just a inch drum the wall plugin so we didn‚Äôt have much time where it would be safe . He wanted 200 boxes moved out of a flooded basement in 2 hours we failed  by only getting 137 so he smacked us around and forced us to grab the rest while he watched threatening when he thought we where going to slow. We eventually got everything but were punished with nothing to eat for dinner.

We moved into one of the apartments in better shape we would occasionally be hit or smacked around but it was a bit more rare at least until we moved to a small town on the edge of the county where we had a wood burning stove and had 8 pitbulls that would use the restroom inside making it smell awful . We were forced to cut wood and keep the fire going he didn‚Äôt want to lift a finger we would cook, clean, and take care of our siblings all while he would wright books that he thought would make him rich. If the fire went out he would wake us up beat us and Make us cut firewood at 3 am on school nights. He started flirting with one of the girls he was selling weed to he was 38 and she was 15 it was very uncomfortable they told each other they loved one another and soon he kicked my mom out of the house and would send her death threats if she ever tryed to get custody of us . The mother of the 15 year old girl as well as my mother put restraining orders on him but he broke them daily to harass and threaten my mom and to see and kiss the underage girl. He definitely had sexual relations with this girl before she was 16 and even after they constantly had a sexual relationship all while the restraining order was in effect. When she turned 17 he got her pregnant and right before she gave birth he was able to marry her effectively grooming her . 

While this under age girl was pregnant we moved into my grandmas house they then developed a spice addiction and drained her life savings we were helpless and unable to stop him or he would threaten to kill is. The baby was born but had a possative thc test and the spice addiction gave him a learning disability. About a year later they kicked there spice addiction and started saving to move out of my grandmas home, there was a town named freedom indiana where we ended up moving to . My dad lost all his apartment due to foreclosure right before he divorced my mom but was able to rent to own a modular on 10 acres of land , his plan this time to make money was to start a farm  and have me take care of it for him . My brother stayed with my grandma and was of age at this point and I was 16 so now I had to take care of my younger siblings and 100 animals. He purchased 16 goats 50 chickens 25 ducks 4 pings 4 turkeys 3 lambs and we owned 6 dogs . He would buy 150 lbs of break and expect that to be enough for all these animals to eat for 2 months. My only gift for my birthday was a axe to build a fence with for a 10 acre plot of land . My heart still sinks being forced to choose what animals would live or die and being blamed for his actions. Whenever an animal would die he would blame me when he wouldn‚Äôt listen to my pleads for grains and feed for the animals. One of our dogs was so hungry it attacked a lamb breaking the lambs leg . I was blamed for this and was forced to watch my dad shoot the lamb in the head  and was told to throw the animal in the woods. While in freedom he started drinking again and nearly shot me in the head one night when the barn light went out  and he sent me out to fix it. Food was scarce and I lost 20 pounds I knew that if it kept up like this we would starve my siblings and myself hadn‚Äôt eaten for nearly a week while my dad and his wife would eat fast food as to not have leftovers for us. I went outside in the middle of winter with my axe and killed 3 chickens to eat . To take the like of an animal is to lose a pice of oneself but I couldn‚Äôt watch my siblings starve and I could feel myself growing weak for hunger. My explanation to him was the chickens froze to death which wasn‚Äôt much different then what had been happening we had already lost 8 to the cold and I would be blamed regardless. He never put a once of effort into the farm he desperately wanted he just wanted his children to do the work for him without food for themselves or the animals.

He failed to pay on the modular and we were evicted and soon moved  right outside greencastle Indiana where we were on roughly 4 acres of land . He demanded I build a fence in less than a mouth with just my axe and trees. I was able to do it but the skin on my hands would peel off exposing the unripe skin underneath, blood would drip from the hilt of my axe and I would feel every swing each being worse than the last . I dug post holes and soon the fence was finnished but the work was rushed and shoty. The land was more fertile so the animals were able to eat and give birth to healthy offspring unlike the previous address where we had a dozen still birth goats. I would soon find a way to move in with my grandmother he was regaining to fear I might be able to overpower him at the age of 17 so he forced me to live with my grandmother. 

Although my grandmothers house was ravaged and would soon be condemned due to the damage my dad did to her house the peace I felt living with her was like nothing I experienced up until this point. She treated me differently to my brother and seemed to favor him but to me I didn‚Äôt care I was starved for affection and didn‚Äôt know what it felt like to be loved I didn‚Äôt mind being lesser. The summers were moderate because we hade a working ac but in the winter the house would get as low as 20 degrees. The cold was a minor issue and was easy to get past. In the spring I had a strangulated hernia that nearly took my life I was told that if I waited just 4 hours longer to go to the hospital I would have died . The recovery from my surgery was long no one stayed with me while I was in the hospital I was all alone for 2 weeks. When I was able to leave my dad picked me up and had me for 3 days and in that time I was forced to babysit and feed and water his animals when the doctor told me to be in bed rest. I was finally able to go back to my grandmothers house but to my shock  a week later my dog that my dad still had at his house died from him starving him to death . I think he did this to spite me for not constantly coming over to take care of his farm  but I buried my pup. 

The recovery from my surgery took a year and still I needed a follow up to Finnish the repair. In the summer of 2016 we moved to an apartment and my grandmothers house was condemned . Our new home was in town where finding a job would be easier , both me and my brother found work to pay the bills and around this time my dad kicked my sisters out so we took them in to raise them. A few years later my grandmother died and I cut my dad off . I haven‚Äôt talked to him since 2020 .


If you made it this far thank you so much for reading my story I hope that if you have similar issues in your own life knowing you are not alone will help you stay strong , you can survive.

1io2smr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1io2smr/proposing_to_her_on_valentines_day/,Proposing To Her On Valentine's Day,"Ilang weeks na 'kong (37M) kabado para sa gagawin ko bukas. Ready na ang venue at ring. I wanted to invite her friends and family to witness us but she has social anxiety who hates too much attention so I just asked my work buddy to capture the proposal. From the moment I met her (35F) alam kong siya na ang magiging partner ko sa buhay hanggang pagtanda. Corny man pero in love na in love talaga ako sa kanya kahit more than a year pa lang kaming mag bf-gf. After our anniversary, I realized I can't go on another year na hindi ko siya napapakasalan.

Let me simp about her for a while. I met her in one of my business trips in Negros. I was having coffee nung pumasok sila ng mga friends niya sa shop. Walang slowmo na naganap but her smile and eyes felt home to me. I can't explain it but I felt the kind of comfort na hindi ko pa na experience sa iba. I can't take my eyes off of her at sabi ko sa sarili ko na pag single 'to ito na magiging asawa ko haha! Tipid lang yung mga ngiti niya but her eyes have so much kindness in them. I knew that I must know her more, so before I left, I mustered the courage to introduce myself sa group nila, pretended I was asking for directions then kinapalan ko na mukha ko to ask her name, number and socials. I felt bad when I saw her discomfort when she was being teased by her friends. I just gave her a reassuring smile and apologized for my intrusion.

That night, I didn't waste time and called her. Nakakahiya pero pinagnasahan ko na agad sa sobrang lambing ng boses niya üòÜ I found out she's single (nbsb) but had no interest to be in a relationship kasi raw andami niyang insecurities sa katawan and that she was happy sa current state ng buhay niya. 

I am a well-established man and confident naman sarili ko but when I found out who she is and what she does, medyo nag alangan ako noong una because I didn't know where to stand in her life. She pretty much covered everything and she didn't need any man to complete her. At 35, she has a job with lucrative pay, takes care of her own bills, pays her mortgage, owns a car, has investments, insurance and likes jet setting alone. She's admirable, smart and hell of a boss lady. 

5 months na suyuan with calls, VCs and dates na hirap na hirap akong mapa Oo siya para sumama lol. I thought parang hindi na talaga  ako kailangan sa buhay niya until she gave me a chance. Although she refused to live with me, I settled in Bacolod to be with her more often. She's a woman of principles who knows what she want but she never made me feel na I'm not equal to her, instead, she has been supportive, understanding and kind to me. Never nanigaw or naging bastos. Sobrang mature niya emotionally at mentally na minsan nagugulat na lang ako on her advices and thoughts in different aspects of life. She so eloquent and never brags about anything kahit ang dami niyang achievements. At first she's a bit reserve and uptight but eventually naging comfortable na siya sa'kin. Para talagang boss ang vibe niya noong una na akala mo ang hirap i please but I was wrong. She's the kindest with the wittiest humor. I learned that she's just a kid na maagang nag man-up to support her family. She's so adorable kapag nagpapa baby. Ang sarap pakinggan ng mga tawa niya at nakapabait sa ibang tao. She listens alot and she always wants us to address the elephant in the room kapag may tampuhan, hindi yung may pa silent treatment until the issue dies down. Because of her, I learned that communication fills the cracks in the relationship. She said she's not domesticated (im cool with it) but I know she's a nurturing woman. I know because I can see how she treats her family well. Sobrang maalaga niya and never failed to remind me how much she loves me through gestures and words.

I'm so lucky to have her and it breaks my heart  whenever she tells me she feels ugly because of her weight. She been doing portion control and work outs pero dahil sa pcos niya hindi madali ang progress. Despite of her insecurities, mahal na mahal ko siya. Tanggap ko lahat sa kanya. I'll still give her the world and I'm working harder to make sure she doesn't need to hustle much to have a comfortable life. I want to baby her and treat her like a queen for the rest of our lives. Please wish me luck that she'd say 'YES' tomorrow üíç  Ready na ang budget for our wedding at bagong bahay once sa simbahan na ang tuloy üíí

really fair:

revolver ammo , rifle ammo, Flare Shells, Mukluks, Manufactured Arrow.

at early game, books are very easy to get to skill up!!!

about medicine items: they are very fair. mostly you need harvestable item so early game use your produced medicens!!! save your herbs to trade later. i mean, you need 24 rose hips to use! 6 painkillers need 4 harvestables!!! same as for other medical items. (after completing the trader request)

almost free after completing requests!!!

hatchet, hacksaw, Quality Tools, Sewing Kit, films, Caffeine Pills, Vitamin-C Pills, Manufactured Arrow

trade coffee its not wise :)  you need 1 cured suppling

however  Caffeine Pills n Vitamin-C Pills need 9 harvestables only!

some items which are mostly recipies you need to trade a car battery! save your batteries!

after completing the request! no battery need to trade!

Last Resort Soup, Pemmican Bar, Porter's Soup, Vagabond Soup

about cured leather for the end game... boots are fair to trade, if you harvest you get 2 n repair whatever you need to repair! better to bring you extra fuses to CH!

After causing catastrophic damage to both Taco Bell and their own reputation, Taco Time decided to take a vacation.

A normal person‚Äôs idea of a vacation? Relaxing.

Taco Time‚Äôs idea? Turning an Airbnb into a crime scene.

Chapter 1: Gavin Unleashed

The squad pulled up to the beach house, ready to ruin the peace and quiet.

JD kicked open the door. ‚ÄúTHIS HOUSE BELONGS TO US NOW.‚Äù

Brody walked in and looked around. ‚ÄúDamn, this place is actually nice.‚Äù

Zoey sighed. ‚ÄúNot for long.‚Äù

And then, before anyone could even process their surroundings‚Äî

Gavin took off.

Not just walking. Full sprint.

BOOM.

He vaulted over the couch, landed on the coffee table, and‚Äî

CRASH.

The table exploded into wooden pieces.

JD choked. ‚ÄúBRO, YOU JUST PULLED A KARLI.‚Äù

Karli, arms crossed, nodded in approval. ‚ÄúFinally. Somebody else breaks things.‚Äù

Zoey groaned. ‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt been here for five minutes.‚Äù

Gavin got up like nothing happened. ‚ÄúY‚Äôall built like that weak-ass table.‚Äù

JD started dying. ‚ÄúBRO.‚Äù

But Gavin wasn‚Äôt done. He sprinted outside, climbed onto the roof, and‚Äî

JUMPED STRAIGHT INTO THE POOL.

A huge wave splashed over everyone.

Brody shook his head. ‚ÄúI swear, we‚Äôre gonna get kicked out before we even unpack.‚Äù

Chapter 2: The Neighbor‚Äôs Regret

Just as Taco Time was getting comfortable in their chaos, a voice interrupted.

‚ÄúEXCUSE ME!‚Äù

The squad turned.

A Karen and her balding husband stood at the fence, arms crossed.

‚ÄúSome of us are trying to enjoy a peaceful vacation,‚Äù she snapped. ‚ÄúAnd you kids are being absolutely unbearable.‚Äù

Gavin grinned. ‚ÄúOh, this gon‚Äô be fun.‚Äù

Chapter 3: The Roast of No Return

Gavin hopped out of the pool, walked straight to the fence, and sized them up.

Then he pointed at the husband.

‚ÄúAyo, my guy, you out here built like a baked bean with a mortgage.‚Äù

JD started wheezing.

The guy‚Äôs eye twitched. ‚ÄúExcuse me?!‚Äù

Gavin wasn‚Äôt done.

‚ÄúAnd your wife? Bro, she got the energy of a librarian that hates kids but works at a school for some reason.‚Äù

Zoey choked on her drink.

Karen gasped. ‚ÄúHow dare you‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNah,‚Äù Gavin interrupted, pointing at her haircut. ‚ÄúYou tryna tell us what to do when you got a hairstyle that screams ‚Äòlet me speak to the manager.‚Äô‚Äù

JD collapsed. ‚ÄúHE‚ÄôS ENDING LIVES.‚Äù

The husband tried to step up. ‚ÄúListen here, you little‚Äî‚Äù

Gavin stepped closer. ‚ÄúListen here, you little what? You little can‚Äôt-keep-a-hairline? You little still-wearing-New-Balance-in-2025? You little ‚Äòhoney, the neighbors are too loud‚Äô built-ass?‚Äù

Karen grabbed her husband‚Äôs arm. ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs just go.‚Äù

‚ÄúBut‚Äî‚Äù

‚ÄúNOW.‚Äù

And just like that, the neighbors vanished.

JD wiped a tear. ‚ÄúBro. That was legendary.‚Äù

Gavin stretched. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what happens when people test me.‚Äù

Karli cracked her knuckles. ‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ what‚Äôs next?‚Äù

JD smirked. ‚ÄúI say we take this chaos to the beach.‚Äù

As Dark Things Are Meant to be Loved‚Äî 

Lapsang souchong tea, aloeswood, smoked black amber, aged dark patchouli, tonka, Amazonian breuzinho, Moroccan bhakoor, labdanum, temple incense, caramelized opium, black coffee, black coconut, soft Russian leather, and tabac leaf.


Old Books and Fresh Flowers‚Äî 

Fresh neroli orange flowers and heliotrope blossoms pressed between the delicate paper pages of a leather-bound book.


Heres what it smells like to me layered together:

It smells like decadence and solitary pleasures. It smells like a room filled with books and dark desires. It smells like a solitary cigar sequestered in a boozy club where you have memorized every crack in your seat. A hint of edge. It smells like old copper canister filled with the smothered, dark, and pungent astringency of the coffee beans within. It smells like the flowers you forgot to water in the vase on your desk, sweet and clear and sickly. It smells like meeting your secret lover by the fruit trees with the humid warmth of the night clinging to your lungs. It seeps out in the overripe juice of the oranges scattered beneath your feet. It smells like a pleasant daydream shifted into a melancholy pining and alluring adoration; every word on your foxed pages mingling together and swimming in the perfumed night.",6,1739396209.0,Indiemakeupandmore,0,1.0,False

I am looking for all the Fall Foliage, Foodie Spots, Helpful tips on traffic/avoiding crowds etc. for a Family Fall Trip to the Northeast. I am also curious if the itinerary I am thinking about will even work? Any advice is appreciated! Thanks in advance! (ALSO, am I missing any great stops for fall foliage/cider donut farms?) 

Things we Enjoy: Great food, Fall Foliage/Cider Donuts/Cider/Quaint Farms, Beautiful Beachy/Hallmark Main streets/Towns, Coffee Shops/Thrift Stores/Quaint Shops etc. 

Things We Would Want to Avoid: Large Busy City vibes (\*obv other than our Day in NYC), Crazy crowds/Traffic/Super Expensive Fancy areas. :) 

Our Itinerary: 

  
Thursday, 10/9:   
Fly from Denver to NYC (I found an early flight that gets in at noon) 

\*Do we get a car here? Or avoid that for now, due to traffic & expensive parking?  
I figure we could get to the city Maybe by 3 or 4pm? Walk around & grab dinner (we'd love a Super greasy/Thin cheesy pizza) 

  
Friday, 10/10 (We do Not want to spend much time in NYC. Just enough for our teenage son to see Times Square & a few other staples then head to Boston)

So, I think we will wakeup, grab bagels and coffee here then do a little site-seeing before possibly taking the Amtrak/Train to Boston?)

  
Once we arrive in Boston I'd like to go to Faneuil Hall for lunch then walk around all day to any popular spots. 

Check into our hotel/airbnb then grab dinner in Boston. 

Saturday: 10/11 \*(Grab a rental car?)  
1/2 Day in Boston? (Or ... do we grab breakfast in Boston & use that 1/2 - 3/4 day heading to NH & or VT for foliage and site-seeing before we head to Maine for the night?) 

  
\*This is where I need some help. We don't have to STAY or stay long in many spots in Maine. 

We can simply stop for a little site seeing in the smaller towns and keep driving to our top locations for longer stays there. 

We will be flying back home from Portland Maine to Denver, so I'm wondering since we want to see some smaller towns briefly ... and eventually spend a day In Bar Harbor and Maybe a day or 1/2 day in Acadia Park ... Should we head to Bar Harbor (after stopping in a few smaller towns) first ... passing Portland and not stopping yet? And save Portland for the last 1/2 day before we head to the Airport? 

  
So, here's my possible Maine itinerary: 

  
Sunday: 10/12 - Kittery, York, \*Ogunquit, Wells, \*Kennebunkport (Spend night in Kennebunkport?)

Monday: 10/13 - Rockland / Camden 1/2 day then Bar Harbor 1/2 day - spend the night. 

Tuesday: 10/14 - Bar Harbor/Acadia National Park \*Do we do 1/2 day here then 1/2 day in Portland before airport? - fly out evening.

or

Wednesday 10/15 - Breakfast in Bar Harbor? Drive to Portland 1/2 day there then evening flight Portland to Denver?

  
Thank you SO much in advance!

1io2egv,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/1io2egv/why_was_i_selected/,Why Was I Selected?,"I graduated this¬†past December with my bachelors in CompSci, no internship or previous experience in tech.¬†I started applying to roles in February, sent out about 200 applications until I heard back from a moderate sized tech company as a QA Engineer.I received an email from a recruiter saying he saw my application and had some questions to ask. He sent me a list of around 20 questions, ranging from ""What's your prior experience"" to ""What language are you most familiar with"" to ""What's your expected starting salary"". I wrote one to two paragraphs per answer that called for it, then received a call from him the next day stating he was setting me up for an interview with the lead SDET. This surprised¬†me, as the recruiter had previously¬†told me in the initial email that this position had already received a ton of applications, although the company was hiring for two positions.

I virtually interviewed with this lead SDET, we'll call him Josh. Josh asked me questions such as ""What do you think of when someone says testing framework"", ""Can you give me some examples of object oriented programming"", ""Can you give me some examples of using python"", etc. I answered some of these okay but felt like I completely floundered on others. For example, when asked what object oriented programming was, I gave the example of a base car object that can later be modified with things like different colors, types of engines, etc, but I was then asked what the four pillars of OOP were, and I couldn't list one. Towards the end of the interview, I had already written this company off as another rejection, but was shocked when Josh informed me that he was going to recommend that I move on in the interview process. I thanked him and stopped the meeting.

I had the final interview on-site with multiple different people, including my future manager, the senior manager of another team, and the VP of software engineering. The manager gave me her phone and asked how I would test the functionality of it, then the rest of the interview she gave me tips on interviewing with the other two coming up next. The VP asked me specific programming algorithm questions such as how bubble sort worked and what the runtime of bubble sort was (I stupidly got this one wrong), and then he talked about how he needed all engineers to use tools like copilot so the company did not fall behind in production. The senior manager talked about our work commutes and the company culture and benefits. These three back-to-back interviews were odd in that they were far less technical than my first interview, they almost felt like I had already been hired and this was more of a formality (which I later learned was basically the case). I received a call from the recruiter the next day stating they were offering me the position. 

I finished onboarding and started working for the company. I worked very closely with Josh, as he was my ""mentor"" (kind of like a preceptor) and showing me all the ropes. Josh had interviews all day on Tuesdays and half the day on Thursdays. My desk was right next to his and my manager, so I was privy to overhear their conversations about how the interviews went. This is where the original title assertion comes [from.At](http://from.At) this point, Josh has interviewed at least 25 people, most likely more, for my role and the same second role, and I am the only candidate he has chosen for either. Josh's¬†reasoning for why he did not go with one candidate or another are always very small, minute details that don't make sense to me. For example, he turned someone away because they suggested our company use a certain testing framework, another because they only had experience with a different testing framework (mind you I had zero testing experience), another because their commute would be too long, you get the picture. I understand that in this job market, companies and interviewers can be extremely picky, but that doesn't answer the question as to why I was chosen. I had zero experience, was fresh out of school, and felt like I had failed the interview. I have heavy imposter syndrome, I feel like at any moment I will be pulled aside and told, ""sorry, we decided to go with another candidate."" Rationally I know this won't happen, as I've been with the company for two weeks now and they've spent money getting me the proper equipment and training resources, but I can't shake the feeling. I have indirectly asked Josh why he chose me, and his answer was, ""Honestly, I don't really remember your interview,¬†I've done so many at this point."" Maybe it was because we interviewed right after his coffee break and he mistook the good feelings of the caffeine buzz with the good feelings of a good interview? I do not know.

Here are things I did well, not that they should have landed me the job:¬†

I studied a ton on what the company did, even asking recruiter for advice,

During the interview, I said I didn't know if I didn't know and didn't try to bullshit,

I built a small Selenium testing framework and python scripting project for my github in the two weeks between Josh's interview and the onsite interview, although I don't think this did anything because Josh already selected me,

I applied to the job one day after it was posted,¬†I dressed in a white button up and black tie for every interview, including the virtual one,¬†

I had a 4.0 GPA, something the VP pointed out multiple times and said, ""You achieved a 4.0 GPA while working full-time, we need more hard workers like you"",¬†

My previous job has me working with people all day, so my soft skills and eye contact are on point (although I feel like I floundered even these during Josh's interview).

My strongest programming language was python, and that was the language in which we would be building the framework.

Does anyone have any idea as to why I was selected based on these things, or is the process truly luck? The one I think affected me the most was the 4.0 GPA, as that was brought up by both the recruiter and VP, and also my strength in Python.

I learned that it's mostly about selling investment products to clients, which I don't find appealing. 

I prefer trading for return performance for the firm. I was wondering if a buy-side hedge fund would be a better fit for me.

If so does anyone have a good knowledge of what sales and trading is?",2,1739395851.0,FinancialCareers,3,1.0,False
1io2c25,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1io2c25/old_friendcrush_30f_reached_out_after_a_decade/,Old friend/crush (30f) reached out after a decade acting strangely avoidant,"This is a bit lengthy, so thank you if you read through. To help me understand her side of things‚Äî avoidants, how would you feel in her position? How would you feel if a friend you had feelings for confessed to you?

A little context‚Äî We were friends for about 4 years. Talked frequently, shared all the same interests/humor, could talk to each other most of the day, and regarded one another as one of the other's closest friends. I had a huge crush on her which she was aware of, but she was dating somebody at the time so I never made a move. Things were good for years until I started growing more awkward around her due to my crush intensifying (which I also felt had gone on too long) and this became reflected in me taking longer and longer to reply back. Then one day, mid-conversation, she just stopped replying. There was no read receipt. Feeling this was a confirmation of her not caring about me anymore, I just never reached back out.

9 years later she reaches out at 3am with a friend request (I'd reached out myself 5 years earlier, but my attempt was left on read for a week which'd led me to unfriend her) and a random exclamation of ‚Äúwhoa. whoa. **\*name\***‚Äù. I said what's up, was left on read for 4 days before asking if she got my message, then was left on read for 3 more days, before she finally asked me how life had been going, ignoring my previous question. I was confused but assumed something just got mixed up and replied, and was left on read again for several days. This continued for 3 weeks as we exchanged small messages (I mean like one reply from her each time) and the excited re-connection I'd expected never seemed to materialize. I at last point-blank asked her why she had messaged me after so long and it took a week of that question being on read plus me re-prompting to get ‚Äúyou were always just such a good friend, I wanted to reach out.‚Äù

Oddly enough, that was the beginning of the single good conversation we had during this whole period. I decided to ask her out for coffee and she immediately opened up. It was like a switch had been flipped and we were both suddenly so excited to be talking to the other again. We spent an hour sending instant replies. I couldn't even get everything I wanted to say in because she was replying too quickly, and it took me several attempts to end the conversation. (I had plans that evening.) She gave me a week/weekend of full availability to choose from and it felt like that awkward hump had been cleared. We were talking like we used to and I couldn't help but feel that something more could potentially happen. It had that kind of unspoken momentum.

Well, two days later she no-shows coffee. It takes several days for me to hear from her and she tells me something about getting a flat and trauma relating to a car accident and that she spiraled and didn't want to ‚Äúput that on me‚Äù. She's upset and apologetic and I try to comfort her but she ends up turning off notifications for the week. She returns several days later apologizing for a ‚Äúlittle meltdown‚Äù.

The two months following that are marked by her agreeing to several more attempts to hang out, whereupon she never follows up on the plans I present, both of us growing more emotionally upset, her apologizing for being a bad friend and not being able to keep up with people, and awkward attempts at breadcrumb conversation. She tells me ‚Äúwe will stay in contact and we will hang out again‚Äù, thanks me for wanting to be around, and stresses time and again that she has and always will care for me.

We don't have another conversation like the month previous. I tell her that my feelings are returning and that I wanted to let her know if she intends on continuing to talk to me, to give her the opportunity to turn me down, but she ignores my acknowledgment and continues to engage. I become more explicit with my feelings over the course of the holidays as her avoidance becomes more obvious to the both of us, again to give her clear chances to turn me down, but she always ignores them. I at last tell her, after the 4^(th) or 5^(th) time of attempting to hang, that if she isn't interested she just has to actually tell me. She waits 5 days and ignores that message, telling me instead that our favorite band is on at the bar.

It fell apart after that. I told her that maybe I shouldn't go through with hanging out because this situation hadn't been good for me, and she ended up apologizing, saying that she shouldn't have reached out if she wasn't ready. Things got more emotionally charged and I was stupid and confessed to her that I'd loved her all along, ever since we were first friends. It's not something I wanted to do or would have ever done in any other circumstance, but at the time I truly believed it was over and I didn't want to live not having told her.

My confession caused her to withdraw completely, I think. It's been on read almost a month, although she still read my several follow-ups quickly.

I just don't understand what's going on. I don't know why she seemed to withdraw from the very beginning. We used to be able to talk to each other so easily and I'd never seen anything like this from her before. My assumption is that she's avoidant and has feelings for me to some degree, but is worried about either hurting me (a fear she has directly expressed), or is worried about the seriousness a relationship between us would entail. What kills me is I don't think we have another chance at this and the only reason it might not be materializing is because she fears the strength of it. I fear constantly that time is running out but don't know what to do, if there is anything I can do.

I always felt like affection and sexual attention was one sided. He'd never say I'm sexy or appealing, just ""you look nice!"" with a thumbs up. He'd laugh at me if I tried to do anything sexy, like brush my hand across his chest or nibble his ear. We have such a close and kind friendship and love each other's company, but there's something about it that's just not like what I see other couples have. 

He wants to do butt stuff all the time. I peg a lot. And he can't orgasm with my body; it's always a hand job. 

Dirty talk always consists of pleasuring another man in a 3some. Usually him performing sexual acts on another man. 

He sometimes requests to perform oral sex on our spare dildo while I perform intercourse. With his eyes closed. He never looks at me when he achieves climax. 

He always looks bored during intercourse, but denies it every time I try to gently bring it up into a healthy, safe discussion. He just lays there. Doesn't really want to keep going. Falls asleep sometimes. We never try new things.

He never comments on my body the way a man who's attracted to women would. Sometimes he grabs my ass or breasts, but it feels very forced. Not a caress or gentle touch. We've talked about it, but that behavior hasn't changed. 

He will make specific compliments about a man's appearance sometimes. He compliments muscles a lot. He will look a man up and down repeatedly. He will not check women out. Just men. He doesn't even check me out. But I've caught him checking men up and down often when we are out grabbing coffee or grocery shopping. 


We never really make out. We peck on the mouth. It's never sensual or romantic. It's sweet and cuddly and loving, yes. But never romantic. Never sexual. He doesn't initiate sex. When he does, it's a very straightforward verbal request that just has no romance to it. No foreplay. I do all the work. He used to never request at all. We've had dozens and dozens of conversations about what I like in a relationship and what he likes. He is very vague. It just hasn't gotten better. 

I feel like a shell of a person and so untouchable/unlovable. We've talked and talked and cried and talked, but it's stagnated for 3 years now. I've just kinda accepted that this is my life until recently. 

I see what love looks like for others. I want that. I WANT love and romance. 

We just bought a house. We just moved. His family helped. I feel like the worst person in the world.. but I'm not happy. 

His family is very very catholic and have disowned gay family members. His uncle and cousin are gay. 

I think he's afraid to be who he is. He was mentally prepared to cut family off when he dated guys before we got together. He told me that.  

I will always love him. I will always cherish our times together.  He is a sweet, gentle soul and is so so thoughtful. But I'm just... struggling. I don't want to make him hurt. his family was the only family I've ever had. I'm going to be sad losing that. I don't look forward to divorce, but I can't keep living like this.

After matching, we started talking and immediately hit it off. I asked her out for coffee one evening, but she declined, saying she had a flight to her hometown the next morning and needed to finish her work before that. Initially, I thought it was the same old story and that she might ghost me, but surprisingly, we kept the conversation going.

After a while, I asked for her Instagram, and we agreed to meet once she was back in town. We did meet, and since then, we‚Äôve met 4-5 times and talk to each other daily.

The problem is, she recently got selected for PhD opportunity in another country, and she‚Äôll be leaving in the next 4-5 months. So far, we‚Äôve vibed well as friends and haven‚Äôt defined anything between us. Neither of us is ready for a commitment, and we both agreed to keep things as they are. However, as our conversations grow deeper day by day, there‚Äôs a sense that we should consider taking things more seriously.

Knowing that she‚Äôs leaving soon makes me hesitate to take that step. She did mention once, casually, that she‚Äôs okay with long-distance and can manage it, but I‚Äôve had bad experiences with relationships in the past. I really don‚Äôt want to commit or develop serious attachments right now.

With Valentine‚Äôs Day coming up, I‚Äôm thinking of asking her out. I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll say yes, but I‚Äôm unsure about what kind of outing would be ideal. Should I plan something special to show her I‚Äôm more into her, or should I keep it casual, like a simple dinner date, and just part ways afterward? Can you all suggest ideas for both? What special thing could I do to make it memorable, and what would be a good plan for a normal, casual date?

Also, before she leaves, I want to give her something special so she remembers me, even if we lose touch. What would you suggest as a meaningful gift for her?",2,1739395011.0,AskIndianMen,3,1.0,False

I roast my own beans using a Gene Cafe for nearly a decade.  
I currently have a 9 year¬†old Breville Smart Grinder Pro. It does the job but I've a lot of (annoying) issues with it.¬†

So my birthday is coming up soon and I'm itching for a new coffee related toy.  
I have narrowed it down to the DF series of coffee grinders. It was initially thinking of the DF64 but I have a budget cap of $1,000. With that said, I'm willing to go with the DF83 series, either the V3 or the V(ariable).

Question, is it practical to go with the 83mm size of the 64mm will be more than enough? I'm sure I can get away with the DF64 but if given the opportunity to go with the DF83, would anybody go that route? I make 1-2 cups of espresso a day on average, more if my wife asks for it.¬†

**My last flip-flop decision is to stick with the DF64 Gen 2 with stock burrs** with a future (cheaper than 83mm) upgrade path with burrs. I'm not considering the variable speed to keep it simple, I heard some issues with it? The DF64 gen 2 seems more stable.  Unless someone can prove that wrong.

Thanks.

1io1yko,https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1io1yko/moral_maturity_of_the_general_authorities_second/,Moral Maturity of the General Authorities (Second Anointing and Societal Morality),"Reading [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/exmormon/comments/1inz4rb/my_lack_of_religion_does_not_mean_a_lack_of_morals/) made me think about the morality of the Q15 and general authorities and at what level do they operate on [Kohlberg's scale of moral development](https://www.google.com/search?q=kohlberg%27s+stages+of+moral+development&rlz=1C1GCEU_en___US1063&oq=kholber&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgCEAAYChiABDIGCAAQRRg5Mg0IARAAGJECGIAEGIoFMgkIAhAAGAoYgAQyDwgDEC4YChiDARixAxiABDIJCAQQABgKGIAEMg8IBRAAGAoYgwEYsQMYgAQyCQgGEAAYChiABDIPCAcQLhgKGMcBGNEDGIAEMgkICBAAGAoYgAQyFQgJEC4YChiDARjHARixAxjRAxiABNIBCDQ4MTNqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8). It was enough of an aside from the original post I thought I'd post separately.

TSCC preaches that obeying commandments is the fundamental method to mature morally. An interesting [study from 1966](https://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/etd/4715/) tested high school LDS church members and compared against Kohlberg's study - one take away:

""\[The distribution of development being a normal curve\] does seem to indicate that the most common types of judgment used by the sample are types three and four, which are characterized by a morality of conventional role-conformity. *This can probably be explained as a result of the emphasis on conformity to LDS norms that is characteristic of the Mormon culture*."" -Gilliland, p.47

From my understanding, the general doctrine in terms of commandment obeying is to first obey out of fear, then obey because you see the personal benefit of it, and then obey because it's your way to show you love Heavenly Father. Phrases like 'the bonds that make you free' - an emphasis on your agency to choose and the existence of God does not lead one to defer moral reasoning entirely but leads to accountability, such as this from Madsen:

""It was Dostoyevsky's character Ivan Karamazov who believed that if God is dead, then everything is allowed. Well, both the premise and the conclusion are misleading. Neither God, nor law, *tell* you what you must do. That is a fiction. They tell you what the inevitable consequences will be of what you do do."" -Madsen, 2000; see [Winder 2009](https://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1451&context=etd)

So the established moral growth is emphasized with agency to choose the right with the underlying motivation of pre-conventional morality of *avoiding punishment.* This carries with it a moral loophole: *I am morally justified if I am not caught, because I have avoided punishment.* Now for the God-fearing member of TSCC the assumption is *God is always watching* so you aren't morally justified with God because He sees all, right?

The laws of God and morality, are not, however, the same as morality found in our societies. If the absolute morality of God is to believed, that means that societal moral norms *are not actually moral.* This statement is backed up by the specificity TSCC goes into support the laws of the land - stating it specifically in the [twelfth Articles of Faith](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/image/meme-articles-faith-twelfth-fe0bd2e?lang=eng) and having the question on honest dealings with your fellow men as a temple recommend question. If these were clearly encompassed in the morality presented in the faith then it would not be necessary to emphasize or restate these things.

The hypocrisy that is often pointed to, however, is how the general authorities actually behave when it comes to lawsuits, building permits, reporting SA, reporting wealth, awarding building contracts (nepotism), and many other instances of perceived amoral behavior that directly contradicts the twelfth article of faith, but by the metric of morality it is (until recently) relatively hidden from the world and is not in contradiction to the morality of God (from their own moral convention) and is, therefore, *justified and moral.*

The final gap - being against the charge to be honest with your fellow men, is covered by having your calling and election made sure in the second anointing. This is the key that allows the societally immoral behavior that is *seen* be justified insomuch that they are free from the 'true' punishment in eternity, and can pay the fine or handle the minimal temporal punishment dictated by societal morality.

The adherence to pre-conventional morality doesn't change, just the justification for their actions. Particularly in the last decade, massive amount of emphasis has been put on obeying, and obeying commandments that are very black and white. Threats of what that [one cup of coffee](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/2007/04/remembering-repenting-and-changing?lang=eng) will do to you - essentially, eternal damnation - and other temporal or spiritual threats for disobeying are constantly made. There seems to be an effort to hold members at that morality level which keeps members controlled by the general authorities. It's the same in regards to lessons in church being watered down to re-reading conference talks - real moral development leads to *true independence* \- no bonds to make you free, because you are *actually free* and exercise your morality by of your own free will and choice.

Of course, this backfires when it comes to actual obedience. Anecdotally I know plenty of TBMs that drink a coffee every once and a while or don't wear garments or occasionally drink alcohol - *and they aren't 'caught' so there is no punishment and thus feel morally justified.* It's that old joke - 

*Why should you always take at least two Mormons fishing?*

*Because if you only take one, they'll drink all your beer!*

 

The summary statement then is the moral maturity of LDS members is purposefully stunted to keep them in line - but that same impeded morality that they themselves adhere to to justify their own immorality - *if you aren't caught, you did nothing wrong.*",5,1739394874.0,exmormon,0,1.0,False

1io1we1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1io1we1/confused_abt_this_situation_w_a_guy/,confused abt this situation w a guy,"I'm a 22F, and I've been in this weird situation with a guy (24M) I met through mutual friends back in 2021. We added each other on social media but didn't really talk much. Over the years, we'd chat here and there, but nothing significant.
mind you he would always say happy birthday or try initiate conversation but i didnt really give much into it.
Fast forward to 2024, I texted him saying how he was doing. He asked me out for coffee, and our first hangout was kind of awkward. A month or two later, he asked me out again, and this time it was actually fun because he picked me up, so we had more time to talk and break the ice.

During our second coffee, he mentioned going to the movies the following Monday, but then he didn‚Äôt text me. Instead, he sent me a random reel that day and nothing more. There was also a time when we were supposed to go out, but because of our work schedules, it just never happened. Another time, I saw him with his cousin, and my friend joined us. Since we all know each other from years back, it was fun. Weeks went by without seeing each other, and then he went out of the country for work.

While he was away, he became more talkative, but it seemed like he only texted me when I wasn't initiating anything. It felt like he liked being ignored or something. Now, he's coming back and says he misses me and wants to see me. He mentioned before how he has to see me when he's back because he misses me. Throughout the years, we were always just friends, platonic, and there was never any flirting.

I'm really confused about what's going on. Is he interested or just playing games? I might of left out a lot of questions, this is my first reddit post so im open to advice and feel free to ask questions  ",1,1739394722.0,Advice,0,0.99,False
1io1w8v,https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodAllergies/comments/1io1w8v/microwave_popcorn_or_biodegradable_coffee_cups/,Microwave Popcorn or biodegradable coffee cups,"Has anyone had a reaction after eating microwaved popcorn (from one of those ready to go pouches)? 

Or drinking from a biodegradable takeaway coffee cup?

I have a suspected latex allergy but I can‚Äôt seem to find any info online saying that either contain latex. However after eating / drinking from both recently I reacted with minor hives.

Could there be a chemical or coating in either that might trigger a similar reaction to latex?

Trying to determine if it‚Äôs that or something entirely different. (Yay! Allergies‚Ä¶)

1io1uqr,https://www.reddit.com/r/constipationAyurveda/comments/1io1uqr/foods_to_avoid_for_constipation_ayurvedic/,Foods to Avoid for Constipation ‚Äì Ayurvedic Perspective üö´üçû,"In Ayurveda, **constipation (Vibandha)** is mainly caused by an imbalance of **Vata dosha**, which leads to **dryness, irregular digestion, and sluggish bowel movements**. To prevent constipation, it‚Äôs important to **avoid foods that increase dryness, coldness, and sluggish digestion.**

Here‚Äôs a list of foods that can **worsen constipation** and should be avoided or minimized:

# ‚ùå 1. Dry & Hard Foods (Increase Vata & Cause Dryness in the Colon)

Dry foods absorb moisture in the digestive tract, making stools **hard and difficult to pass**.

üö´ **Avoid:**

* **Dry toast, crackers, biscuits**
* **Chips, popcorn, dry-roasted nuts**
* **Processed cereals (e.g., cornflakes, granola bars)**
* **Overly dry or undercooked grains (e.g., dry bread, stale rice)**
* **Raw vegetables (especially in large amounts)**

‚úÖ **Prefer:** Moist, well-cooked, and warm foods like **soups, stews, and khichdi.**

# ‚ùå 2. Cold & Raw Foods (Weaken Agni & Slow Digestion)

Cold foods weaken **Agni (digestive fire)** and slow down bowel movements. Ayurveda recommends avoiding excessively cold foods, especially for people prone to constipation.

üö´ **Avoid:**

* **Cold water & ice-cold drinks**
* **Ice cream, frozen desserts, and cold dairy**
* **Raw salads (especially in winter)**
* **Cold smoothies (especially banana-based or dairy-based smoothies)**
* **Cold, uncooked foods (like sushi or raw veggies in large amounts)**

‚úÖ **Prefer:** Warm herbal teas, warm water, and cooked vegetables.

# ‚ùå 3. Heavy & Hard-to-Digest Foods (Cause Sluggish Digestion & Ama Buildup)

Heavy foods cause **stagnation in the gut**, slowing down peristalsis and making elimination difficult.

üö´ **Avoid:**

* **Red meat (beef, pork, lamb, processed meats like bacon & sausages)**
* **Fried foods (deep-fried snacks, fast food, pakoras, fries, chips, etc.)**
* **Hard cheeses (cheddar, parmesan, paneer in excess)**
* **Excess eggs (especially if eaten without vegetables or fiber-rich foods)**
* **Thick dairy products (excess yogurt, curd, or heavy creams can cause blockage)**

‚úÖ **Prefer:** Light, warm, and easy-to-digest meals like **lentils, moong dal, soups, and khichdi**.

# ‚ùå 4. Processed & Refined Foods (Lack Fiber & Cause Digestive Stagnation)

Refined foods have very little fiber and disrupt the natural rhythm of digestion, leading to **dry, hard stools**.

üö´ **Avoid:**

* **White bread, refined flour (maida), and white rice (in excess)**
* **Pasta, noodles, and processed foods**
* **Sugary cereals and pastries**
* **Excessive sweets, chocolates, and artificial sweeteners**
* **Junk food & packaged snacks**

‚úÖ **Prefer:** Whole grains like **brown rice, quinoa, millets, and whole wheat.**

# ‚ùå 5. Excess Caffeinated & Carbonated Drinks (Dehydrate & Aggravate Vata)

Too much caffeine and carbonated drinks can **dehydrate the intestines** and worsen constipation.

üö´ **Avoid:**

* **Excess coffee, black tea, and energy drinks**
* **Carbonated sodas & soft drinks**
* **Alcohol (especially beer, whiskey, and hard liquors)**
* **Artificial fruit juices with added sugar**

‚úÖ **Prefer:** Herbal teas like **ginger tea, fennel tea, or warm cumin water**.

# ‚ùå 6. Astringent & Gas-Forming Vegetables (Worsen Dryness & Bloating)

Certain vegetables **increase Vata dosha**, making constipation worse by causing dryness or gas buildup.

üö´ **Avoid:**

* **Raw cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli (gas-forming)**
* **Brussels sprouts, asparagus, and onions (increase bloating)**
* **Green bananas and unripe fruits (cause dryness & blockage)**

‚úÖ **Prefer:** Cooked, well-spiced vegetables like **carrots, beets, zucchini, bottle gourd, and pumpkin**.

# ‚ùå 7. Excess Legumes & Beans (Difficult to Digest & Cause Bloating)

While legumes are fiber-rich, some are difficult to digest and can cause **gas, bloating, and indigestion**.

The problem is that the doctor was questioning me about drinking soda or sweet tea insisting that I can't have anything like that which is fine because I only drink water. Also said I can't have sugar and coffee which again is fine because I don't drink coffee. But now he has me very nervous about having any sugar and then I read a lot of bad things about the Actos.

About three years ago, I was diagnosed with Scheuermann's disease, a blockage in the sacroiliac joint, Schmorl's nodes and a few months ago, I was diagnosed with an anxiety disorder.

December 2023, I woke up from sleep feeling a very strange discomfort in my left testicle. It wasn't painful, but it was a new and odd sensation. This lasted for about a week, during which both testicles felt sensitive, requiring me to be cautious about sitting down (haha), rarely painful, and if they were, it was very mild 1/10. After about a week, it went away, but just in case, I visited my primary care doctor.

I told her about my issue and she performed a physical examination of my testicles. She said she didn't think it was anything serious and that, due to my back issues, it was quite possible that they were the cause of my discomfort. She advised me to see a urologist if it worsened. Different sensations (discomfort, mild pain, sensitive testicles, enlarged-like epididymis) returned a week later, but this time in my right testicle, where it has persisted to this day. So, I decided to visit a urologist, who conducted a CT scan, blood tests for cancer markers, and a sperm sample analysis to check for bacteria. The only thing the urologist found was very mild varicoceles in the left testicle.

The tests came back clean, and the urologist said he couldn't help me with my issue since there was no apparent problem from a urological perspective after all those tests. However, if it continued to concern me, I should consult an orthopedic specialist and primarily look for the cause in my back.

These strange sensations mostly subsided over time; if they returned, it was only occasionally, perhaps once every couple of months, and lasted a maximum of a day, so I didn't really address it until I had to travel for work abroad. Since I wanted to go there healthy and not have any health issues on the way, I sought out an orthopedic specialist, to whom I presented all my medical reports. He performed a physical exam and said that unfortunately, some people experience these things without any apparent cause. He recommended some vitamins and sent me home.

I felt helpless. Along with all the symptoms, I also experienced a very unusual numbness sensation on the right side of my scrotum, which seemed to indicate some neurological issue. Sometimes after waking up, whether I had slept on my left or right side, the outer side of my thigh would mostly feel numb. However, I attributed that to poor-quality underwear that had a seam pressing against my thigh all night. Additionally, I experienced a very strange sensation in the area (which I don't know the name of) between my scrotum and the inner right side of my thigh, just below where it connects to the lower abdomen. For a while, I attributed this phenomenon to caffeine, as the constricting sensation and discomfort usually occurred after drinking coffee or energy drinks. So, I stopped consuming them, and it seemed to help.

Then there was a longer period of silence during which these problems almost completely disappeared, and I didn't encounter them for some time. Symptoms appeared maybe once every lets say 5-6 months in the form of a sensitive scrotum and a very constricting feeling in the area I described earlier (as if it was inside the right side of my thigh). I didn't really address these issues, as they didn't bother me often, and over time, not at all. However, today is a different story.

This occurrence primarily happens when I sleep on my right side, as whenever I experienced these issues first thing in the morning, it was a consequence of that. The same thing happened this morning; I felt that my scrotum was sensitive, but I didn't pay much attention to it and continued with my day. To be honest, I didn't realize I had any problem at all. After returning home, due to my health anxiety, I began to stress and touch my scrotum in an attempt to figure out the cause. That's when the constricting feeling and numb sensations hit (the scrotum always retracts as if it's cold), and it troubled me for a few hours. Now it's much better; my scrotum is relaxed, I don't feel any pain, and I have no other problems, just constant thoughts about the core of this issue.

Can anyone advise me what can be the cause of this? I've considered the possibility that due to my back issues, a nerve might be compressed, causing these sensations, or possibly an irritated nerve that somehow runs between the inner thigh or lower abdomen. What is particularly inexplicable to me is that these states come and go and are never permanent or cause any significant pain. It's primarily always about discomfort and a constricting sensation in the inner thigh. This is a big unknown for me, which is why I wanted to ask if anyone has encountered a similar form of scrotal pain that isn't permanent but comes and goes occasionally for a long period of time. All the important causes for me, like testicular torsion or cancer, have been ruled out from a urological perspective (especially since these sensations initially occurred in one testicle and then moved to the other). I have some doubts about the orthopedic examination since it didn't seem particularly helpful; I respected what the specialist said, but I am still suffering.",1,1739394400.0,AskDocs,1,1.0,False

Cup of coffee and overdose
I pop these pills like crackerjacks
And the prize, the glazed eyes just watching you react
When you‚Äôre depressed you sleep too much
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm waking up‚Äù 

These lyrics are very relatable and one time I actually attempted suicide this way. It‚Äôs like a knife to the heart and I‚Äôm sobbing so hard I‚Äôm tensed up and shaking. I think about doing it again all the time. I just sleep my days away and I believe I‚Äôm falling into an ED which makes this depression thing 10x worse. I feel so lonely and sick I cry all day and can‚Äôt wait until I can go to sleep (if I even can I‚Äôve been dealing with insomnia). When does it get easier? I would kill to be happy again like I was before 2020. I wasn‚Äôt that happy but I also wasn‚Äôt severely depressed and suicidal like this. Those feelings have been consistent over the past 5 years and it‚Äôs hard to remember life without them. The only reason I‚Äôm still here is because I‚Äôm a pussy and never go far enough. I relapsed and cut myself a couple days ago and I hadn‚Äôt cut myself in a few months (I was vaping instead but quit which was a horrible idea as that was the only thing that made things easier). My dad yelled at me and almost hit me the other day (had he swung slightly closer he probably would have knocked my shoulder out of place he didn‚Äôt touch me but went for it). He told me I can never drive his truck again (all I have right now because I was in an accident not caused by me a year ago that totaled my car) because I drive like a ‚Äúmaniac‚Äù even though I thought I was doing good. I thought I couldn‚Äôt possibly feel more insecure but that was a low blow because that was one of the last things I had. He‚Äôs saying I can drive it now but I‚Äôm terrified of driving after all of that shit so I won‚Äôt bother. My mom constantly tells me she doesn‚Äôt know what more she can do to make me happy and that nothing is ever enough for me but I try so hard to be happy. I do my best not to cry around her but sometimes I can‚Äôt hold back and I break down and she gets angry at me. Then she apologizes and when I emphasize how much her words hurt me she says ‚Äúeverything I do is always wrong‚Äù just guilt tripping the fuck out of me. My sisters say they couldn‚Äôt imagine life without me but have both told me to just go ahead and kill myself. Even losing weight I don‚Äôt feel pretty and being a lesbian is fucking hard. I‚Äôve never kissed a girl and I‚Äôm a virgin. Both of those things are by choice, I have girls who like me but we never make it past a talking stage because they either love bomb the fuck out of me and ghost me or love bomb the fuck out of me and develop an obsession. I have high standards because I know even though I hate myself I deserve better than those women but fuck it‚Äôs lonely. Sometimes I wish so deeply I could be straight I almost go out and let a man fuck me so I can feel something. Idk what holds me back I guess it‚Äôs just so disgusting I can‚Äôt let myself stoop that low. I wish I could time travel to 2008 and able to go to Katy Perry‚Äôs Hello Katy tour. One of the Boys has become  my favorite album of all time and the only thing that can comfort me. I was only 3 turning 4 when it released so I couldn‚Äôt really enjoy it which makes me so nostalgic I feel sick. Even my chinchillas have been angry at me lately I guess they sense that I‚Äôm depressed because usually we are very close so I don‚Äôt have them. I have no friends they all ditch me when I start showing signs of being depressed (except a few of my online friends that have been in my life for years but it‚Äôs not the same as having someone to talk to in person). I almost got a therapist again but she wanted to consult with my mom first instead of me as if I was a little kid so I said no (I don‚Äôt want my mom to speak for me or set the tone for my therapy sessions) so I‚Äôll just deal with this alone I guess. I don‚Äôt want to feel alone or sad anymore. I can‚Äôt go back to a psych hospital and meds do nothing for me. I‚Äôm going to go crazy there‚Äôs nothing left. I don‚Äôt know what to do with myself anymore. I don‚Äôt even really want to be dead but I also don‚Äôt want to be alive. I‚Äôm stuck because existing is rough but imagining not existing and listening to my comfort album on loop sounds horrible. All I feel is constant guilt because it‚Äôs selfish to kill myself but it feels selfish to make the people around me suffer in my presence any longer. I suck. I don‚Äôt know I guess I‚Äôm typing into the abyss but I want to feel heard by somebody who can maybe relate. ",0,1739394376.0,depression,0,0.5,False

Is leagues better. Maybe even galaxies better than ever taking a leadership role. 

My eyes are still smiling. The managers got this droopy little pair of dog eyes that is incredibly hard to notice but once you do. Don't stop noticing. 

Yes everything is downright hell out here. From writeups to fucking store cards. It's hell. Got that out of the way. Having the job equivalent of damacles dagger over my head is definitely gonna give me early onset dementia eventually. But for now. Notice your managers. 

Rarely does anyone smile in retail. The ones who do are psychotic and not to be trusted. Like. Me. I love this job. It's the bare minimum to get paid and with jobs going to shit left and right. I'm getting paid rn. What the fuck ever. 

But they all have the same set of eyes. They don't do drugs. That I know of... 

Its like the sad face the theater masks. The happy sad ones. Those almost inverted bean shaped holes in their eyes. 

Every manager I've met in the near decade of retail. Had these same eyes. Like a bassethound is near the end of its life. Just sitting on the porch. Lifeless. 

Glazed, cloudy stares. It's almost like being here for a decade sucks the ever lasting humanity out of you. The face of 20 years or 10. Flashing by. Still the same vest. Still the same name tag. You can get a vacation. But being a manager means you can manage now. Relax later. 

Being a cashier is fucking AWESOME. because I won't be soul sucked into a position that will scare away any friends I've made here. 

I won't be able to have those eyes. The eyes of a strange despair. One I only see in people who have reached the dead end of life. 

Even the youngest crew member will get puffy eyes or two. It comes it clopening. Some days your fresh and ready to rock. 

Other days you're staring down the same thing you seen for years. A sterile yet somehow extremely messy store with Chaotic orders. Yeah I can cashie-oh I can take stuff to departments.... Oh I'm now pushing carts. That was 3 rapid fire orders and I still don't know what my job title is. 

Being this low on the ladder mean yes I'm the first to be stepped on and last to be useful in times of need. But fuck that noise. I'm a slave to the register. No the store. My job is coupons. Not taking shit back. You have plenty of other overworked logistics to help and I'll just stay up here. 

I know I'll be piled on with other people's shit to let them relax. 

THOSE eyes are from years of managerial ""Hey can you do this? Thanks."" for days weeks and months on end. Piling up work while other sad eyed coworkers gossip over coffee. 

You get the work so they can relax. Not the other way around.

As I write this, I‚Äôm even shaking slightly-as you would if you were reading it. But I know you never will.

I miss the things-only you know exactly what- I miss the way you did them, in that certain way that no one else could ever match. Just like you said to me on our last night, nothing else will ever compare.

It‚Äôs been six months now. I feel like I‚Äôm becoming a better man-I‚Äôve worked on myself, found new work, and improved physically and mentally. But the pain remains. I hope one day these feelings will fade, because this emotional burden is becoming too heavy to carry.

I‚Äôve lived some life, and I know-the flames we had will never be matched by anything this universe could offer again. You know it, and I know it. That‚Äôs the imprint you left on my soul, just as I left on yours.

Do you remember the evening a couple of weeks ago, when we saw each other from a distance as I was getting into my car?

18mg- didn‚Äôt notice any benefits. Harder to sleep and heart palpitations. 

27mg- felt more focussed for 2 days then didn‚Äôt feel any benefits, woke up with mild chest pain day 3 for 30 mins but got it checked at A&E to be extra safe and all was normal. Psychiatrist was happy for me to continue. It causes excessive sweating and heart palpitations for 1st week but then settled. I received stressful news about a family member‚Äôs health on the 3rd day also so maybe this threw off any positive affects I mightve otherwise seen over those two weeks? Maybe stress was causing lack of focus and thoughts muddled?

36mg- Immediately felt great results. Very focussed, calmer, very productive, I could think straight, quietened my thoughts. My manager mentioned it to me that I was no longer falling behind in work on this dose. 

Well I had my psychiatrist review on 1st of Feb and told him how much 36mg had helped. He was very happy with this and prescribed me another 3 months of 36mg. 

3 days ago, (starting new box of meds that should be exact same) I accidentally had a caffeinated coffee instead of a decaf within the same hour I had my meds. Well I honestly felt high. Like dilated pupils, couldn‚Äôt sit still, stimming loads more, so anxious, couldn‚Äôt focus, heart palpitations etc. 

And now yesterday and today, for the first 2 hours after taking meds I genuinely feel like that again. Just soooo driven by a motor (which isn‚Äôt a usual adhd symptom of mine before meds), can‚Äôt focus, my eyes are blurrier, talking faster, anxious, heart palpitations etc. 

Then after the 2 hours I turn into a zombie for the next 6 hours. No thoughts, slow reactions to everything, can‚Äôt focus, honestly feel so out of it that I don‚Äôt feel fully sober, I avoid talking to people in the office incase they see I‚Äôm just so different or in case my pupils are dilated.

I awoke with a start. I felt like I was choking on something. My face hurt like I was just hit. Where am I? I don‚Äôt remember a thing. Wait‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember a thing! Do I have amnesia? I looked around, I was in a living room, and I didn‚Äôt seem to be in any immediate danger. What do I remember? Let me start at the basics, my name is Gerald Graham, my job is‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I live at‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt a good start. Where am I anyway, and how did I get here? I‚Äôm in a living room, is this my house? If it is this is a nice place. I looked out the window, I was on the second floor of the house.

¬†

The house had a massive garden surrounded by three-metre-high walls. It seemed to be night, near the window was a grandfather clock, it was eleven past nine. I realised I was holding something; it was a vial of Lacocelex. What is Lacocelex again? I think it‚Äôs that new experimental drug meant to lessen some of the symptoms of heart disease, though in overuse it can have the side effect of temporary memory loss. Wait‚Ä¶ How the hell do I know all that?

¬†

I peered into the vial, it was empty. Why would I consume a whole vial of heart disease medicine? Do I have heart disease? I think I would know if I did. To be fair I don‚Äôt even know what my job is, if I even have a job. I suppose I should just wait until the effects of the Lacocelex were off. Patients usually regain memory after about an hour. How do I know that!? Okay, I need to remain calm; this is a nice place!

¬†

A nice cozy modern living room. I guess I could watch television until I figure it out. I sat down on the surprisingly comfortable couch and turned it on. It seems I recorded the recent soccer match to watch. I don‚Äôt like soccer that much, so I‚Äôll probably watch something else. Wait‚Ä¶ why would I record a soccer match if I don‚Äôt like soccer? Do I like soccer? I should watch it in case I do. I started watching the match, which team do I support again? I suppose I‚Äôll remember in due time.

¬†

I watched the game for a few minutes, not particularly enjoying myself. Suddenly I heard a loud shattering noise from the bottom floor. Fear shot through me; someone was breaking into my house. Was there a weapon here? How could I defend myself? I grabbed a nearby chair, I suppose it could do. I heard another sound, like a door opening. I cautiously stepped down the stairs equipped with my chair. I walked into the house‚Äôs kitchen. I saw a short, masked man looking around the house. I dropped the chair when I saw they had a gun. I froze and raised my hands.

¬†

‚ÄúHey!‚Äù I said in shock. They aimed it at my face.

¬†

‚ÄúListen you can take what you want,‚Äù I pleaded desperately. The gun started shaking in their hands, they were looking into my eyes.

¬†

‚ÄúTake what you want, please,‚Äù I begged. They diverted their eyes. If I could remember more of my life, it would probably all flash in front of my eyes now. All I could now recall about my life was my ever-present paralysing fear of death. A fear I knew was always there and now was right in front of me.

¬†

‚ÄúPlease,‚Äù I said finally. They closed their eyes; the gun was wildly shaking. In a single instant, I heard the gunshot, felt a quick stabbing pain in my forehead and saw the smoke emerge from the barrel, a moment later everything went dark. I felt this cold wash over my body, like a freezing shower. Before I could even process the numbing coldness consuming my body, I awoke with a start. Again, I felt like I was choking on something. I looked around, I was again in the living room on the top floor. I grabbed my chest; my heart was pounding. My body no longer felt numb. I felt my forehead, it felt perfectly intact. I swear just a moment ago I felt the bullet pierce my skin.

¬†

I stood up, it had to be a vivid dream, right? I looked around, everything looked the same as it did in my ‚Äòdream‚Äô. If I was dreaming, I should remember everything now, right? No‚Ä¶ I still don‚Äôt remember a thing, just my name, that‚Äôs all. The paradox of what happened overwhelmed me, I couldn‚Äôt‚Äôve been shot, else why would I still be alive now? Yet I can‚Äôt shake how vivid it all was. I can practically still hear the shot, feel the pain and sense that numbness. I saw the same grandfather clock from earlier. It read eleven past nine, just like in my dream. It had to be a dream; it had to be. I once again sat on the couch. I switched on the TV again, like the last time I saw the soccer game I had recorded.

¬†

While I still don‚Äôt remember much about soccer, I know that this game was the same as it was in my dream. While I slowly began noticing all the similarities between this game and the one in my dream, anxiety slowly built up inside of me, the type of anxiety that I imagine someone would experience if they encountered a ghost or any other paranormal experience. Had I peered into the future? No! That‚Äôs ridiculous! I‚Äôm a man of logic, not superstition! Yet logic cannot explain how vivid that dream was, and why everything is the exact same as it was in the dream.

¬†

I heard a noise downstairs, the same one as earlier. Whether what I experienced was a dream, or precognition or whatever, I should‚Äôve heeded its warning. I stood up to run. When I reached the stairs, I saw the masked robber waiting for me at the bottom. I turned to run. Seeing no better option now I suppose my best option is to escape from the window. When I reached the window, I looked back to see the robber walking towards me, eyes closed and gun shaking wildly. I closed my eyes in turn. What would my last thought be? Regret, probably regret.

¬†

I heard the gunshot, felt the flash of pain and once again felt cold envelope me. I awoke with a start. I immediately stood up and walked to the grandfather clock, like the last two times it displayed eleven past nine. I took a deep breath, I had just had two ultra-realistic experiences of death, too realistic to chalk up to dreaming. I must face the possibility that I was in some kind of a time loop. If that‚Äôs true then that means that there is a robber on his way, and I must get out of here now. I set off downstairs. The last time I was here I didn‚Äôt even realise it was the kitchen and dining room. Next to the dining room table was a large whiteboard I also hadn‚Äôt noticed.

¬†

The whiteboard had some kind of technical drawing on it. There was a large circle barely enveloping a ring of evenly spaced smaller circles. There was also a horizontal line protruding from the bottom of the large circle. The large circle was labelled ‚Äú2‚Äù with the smaller ones being labelled ‚Äú1‚Äù. Was this something I was working on before I lost my memory? I had no clue what it could be. Below the whiteboard was a strange electronic ball, I picked it up. It seemed to be homemade and very cobbled together. It had a green light attached to it as well as three buttons labelled ‚Äú1‚Äù, ‚Äú2‚Äù and ‚ÄúX‚Äù. Again, I had no clue what this was. I realised that there was still a robber on their way.

¬†

I tried to open the front door, though it was locked. Where are the keys? I went to the kitchen to look for them. I have no clue where they could be. While checking one of the countertops I accidentally knocked over a coffee mug which was there. I don‚Äôt have time to clean that up now. I stopped searching for a moment. I know that a dangerous robber is going to break into the house at any moment. I can‚Äôt waste my time searching for the keys. I must get out of here now. I saw that there was a massive window next to the kitchen, I picked up a nearby chair and threw it through the window.

¬†

I hoped through, accidentally cutting my leg on the broken glass while I did. It hurt a lot. I limped around the house searching for my car. Do I even own a car? If I do where are the keys? I saw my car parked near the front door. Suddenly I saw the gate open and a car drive through. That had to be them. I ran away, swallowing the immense pain in my leg. I tripped and fell into the grass. I heard the car stop and the door open. Along with the visceral fear of knowing an armed man was approaching, I also felt this indescribable‚Ä¶ hope. I have no clue how my current situation can elicit hope but, that‚Äôs how I feel. I heard a gun load.

¬†

‚ÄúNot this time‚Ä¶‚Äù I barely heard the criminal whisper. I heard the gunshot, felt the pain, felt the cold and as always awoke with a start. As someone who has died thrice already, I can tell you that the feeling isn‚Äôt good. A part of me however did feel relieved that I awoke again. I walked downstairs. I saw the window and coffee mug both as they were before I smashed them. There is no dispute that I‚Äôm in a time loop, one that resets at my death and one that‚Äôs only constant is my consciousness. I thought of the bullet which had pierced my brain several times before. Whatever mechanism reconstructs everything each time the loop resets must also reset the Lacocelex in my brain. This means I can only remember anything if I manage to survive long enough to have its effects wear off.

¬†

I broke the window again, this time making sure not to cut my leg again on my way out. I looked at the walls surrounding the house. Could I climb over them? I also noticed the large main gate. If I could just find the keys, I could exit through there! I noticed a tall tree near the wall. I‚Äôm going to try to climb it and jump over the wall. Only once I reached the top of the tree did I realise that there was a wall-top electric fence covering the whole perimeter. I must value security huh?

¬†

Thinking of the encroaching criminal made me realise that I had to make a choice now. Thinking of no better option I leapt from the tree. The moment I hit the fence a shocking pain covered my entire body. I let go and fell backwards, still reeling from the pain while I fell. When I hit the ground, the pain disappeared and was replaced by the cold numbness. I awoke with a start. I stood up and kicked a nearby table angrily. An empty glass bottle which stood on the table fell to the ground and shattered. Why can‚Äôt I remember a thing? Why of all times must a robber break in now? Why can‚Äôt I find the damn key? And why oh why am I trapped in this time loop!?

¬†

My house was beginning to feel more and more like a prison with each successive loop. Wait‚Ä¶ prison‚Ä¶ police‚Ä¶ I should just call the police! I felt my phone in my pocket and took it out. I dialled the emergency services.

¬†

‚Äú911 what‚Äôs your emergency?‚Äù the voice on the other end asked.

¬†

‚ÄúThis may sound strange, but I think my house is about to be broken into,‚Äù I said.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat is your current location?‚Äù  
  
That would just be my house address, wait‚Ä¶

¬†

‚ÄúHold on‚Ä¶‚Äù I said.

¬†

I went into my phone‚Äôs map app. No Wi-Fi. Strange but I just turned my data on. When I finally found my address, I just read it to them.

¬†

‚ÄúAll right sir we should have someone there in about ten minutes,‚Äù they said. I looked at the clock, it was a quarter past nine, and the robber was going to be here in about five minutes.

¬†

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs just great,‚Äù I said before angrily hanging up. Now what? I looked out the window at the main gate. If the robber arriving is inevitable, and they‚Äôre repeatedly going to come through the gate, can‚Äôt I just run out the gate when they get here? I went downstairs and broke open the window. While I walked to the gate, I thought about how alone I currently was. It‚Äôs late at night and from the map, I could tell I live in a remote location. I‚Äôm the only one trapped in this loop as far as I can tell, and I don‚Äôt even have my memories to keep me company. A disturbing thought crossed my mind, if my consciousness is the only constant through the loop then wouldn‚Äôt that mean that all the other people are forced to do the same thing repeatedly?  
  
The only one who could change their actions is the robber since they interact with me, but they wouldn‚Äôt even realise that. What about all the people who are forced to relive the last ten minutes over and over without even realising? The gate opened. I ran out past the car. The car stopped and quickly reversed. Suddenly it swerved to the side hitting me from behind. The sheer momentum knocked me to the ground. I knew I was about to pass out, if not worse. I faintly heard a car door open before being consumed by cold and waking with a start.

¬†

Was the car hitting me from behind really enough to kill me? Maybe I just passed out and the robber did the rest? What else could I do? The first time around I froze, then I fled, now let me try to fight. I went to the kitchen. I found two kitchen knives. I decided to keep looking for the gate‚Äôs keys. When I heard the gate open in the distance I grabbed the two knives.

¬†

When they opened the door, I charged at them. Before I could reach them, they promptly gunned me down. The last thing I saw was their shocked expression. After I woke up again, I started laughing. I guess that old saying about a knife and a gunfight is true. What do I do now? I don‚Äôt have to rush to do anything. It‚Äôs strangely reassuring to know that no matter what happens to me I‚Äôll wake up again. I suppose I could relax a little before trying to do anything else. My biggest priorities are still to escape this house and to figure out how I ended up in this loop, but I don‚Äôt have to rush.

¬†

Wait‚Ä¶ why do I feel like this? Shouldn‚Äôt being trapped in a house destined to always be robbed be a terrifying scenario? Why am I not that scared anymore? I suppose the loop gives me certainty. At the start, it was scary and frustrating, but I guess the certainty of what comes next, and the certainty of my waking up again takes away the pressure. If a task is something important but not urgent then it ceases to induce stress.

¬†

I noticed something strange next to the table in the room. A glass bottle was on the floor shattered with its top in pieces, but the bottom was still intact. I remembered with horror how I had kicked this table two loops back in frustration. For some reason, this bottle remained constant throughout the loops resetting. Why could that be? I don‚Äôt even know why there is a loop in the first place, so there can‚Äôt be any way for me to figure out what‚Äôs special about this bottle.

¬†

If this bottle is a constant what else could be? The mug I smashed downstairs in a similar fashion reset, same with the window as well. The robber must also reset, since if he could remember previous loops why does he keep trying to kill me? I looked at the grandfather clock, it read twelve past nine, clearly the entire dimension of time resets as well. Hell, even my body and brain reset, no matter what fatal injury I experience I still wake up fully healthy each time. Even when I‚Äôm shot in the head my brain resets.

¬†

I stared down at the broken bottle in my hand. Something was special about it and my consciousness. Something that allows both of us to remain constant through this strange anomaly. I dropped the bottle. It smashed into even more pieces on the floor. I walked downstairs to the kitchen; I had to clear my mind. I realised that I was quite hungry, not hungry enough to eat any of the previous loops but still hungry. I opened the fridge to see a closed bag of chocolate muffins. I tried one of them‚Ä¶ it was delicious! It had this amazing peanut butter in the centre. I immediately began eating the other muffins.

¬†

I was delighted that I would still be able to eat more of these muffins since they would presumably reset with the loop. I sat down on one of the chairs to wait for the robber. Strangely, I was waiting for this dangerous criminal about as casually as I would for a doctor or dentist. Huh, both my examples of waiting are medical. Weird.

¬†

I felt an itch in my neck. I coughed to try to relieve the itch. I realised that it was beginning to get difficult to breathe. I hadn‚Äôt been like this on the previous loops. What changed? I realised that there was only one thing it could be. The muffins. I began desperately searching for my Epinephrine injector, which I must have somewhere. As my breathing continued to become more and more difficult, the unpleasant feeling became more and more familiar.

¬†

I suppose it makes sense why this feeling is familiar. It‚Äôs just frustrating that I didn‚Äôt remember that I had this allergy in the first place. Why does this horrible feeling feel familiar, but my house doesn‚Äôt? I suppose the allergy has been with me longer. I ran into the bathroom, desperate just to find anything to make the reaction go away. With every passing second, I became more desperate while it was also becoming increasingly difficult to quell that desperation with it becoming more and more difficult to breathe.

¬†

I heard the front door open; I suppose this was one way of stopping the reaction. I walked out of the bathroom; I saw the now familiar robber aiming the trembling gun at me. As the cold enveloped me the itching in my neck vanished. I awoke with a start feeling relieved that it was over. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt eat those delicious muffins (or any other product with peanuts in them) again. Well, I can still eat them if I get a real craving, death is after all just an inconvenience now.

¬†

I saw the bottle from earlier smashed into many more pieces, just like it was in the previous loop. This simple bottle might be essential to figuring out how I got into this situation, yet I don‚Äôt even have the beginning of a plan of how to unravel its secrets. What do I do now? I felt this stress to escape up until now but now I feel this‚Ä¶ apathy? Perhaps that‚Äôs not the right word. The consistency of my continual renewal each time I ‚Äòdie‚Äô has given me faith that I will continue evading death. I think I should relax for a moment. I have no rush after all. What other food is there downstairs? I‚Äôm hungry after all those muffins disappeared from my stomach.

¬†

I found a packet of two-minute noodles in the cupboard. After making them in the microwave, I sat on the couch opposite the front door. There was no point in hiding from my opponent. The noodles were delicious! When the robber walked through the door, I greedily took another bite before the bowl exploded in my hands. When I awoke, I smiled. I knew that I could just make myself the same packet again. However, the happiness of being able to eat the noodles again was being eclipsed by something else.

¬†

I felt this creeping feeling build inside of me, something I might‚Äôve subconsciously felt during the last loop but ignored. I couldn‚Äôt quite place my finger on what it was, but I knew that I couldn‚Äôt relax, I had to escape this damn house. I ran downstairs and stood beside the door with my back to the wall to ensure he didn‚Äôt see me. I waited for the robber to arrive for a couple of tense minutes. When the door opened, I whipped around and punched him in the face, in response he promptly shot me in the chest. When I awoke again, I knew what to do.

¬†

I ran downstairs again and once again waited against the wall. When the door opened, I whipped around and first grabbed the gun then punched him in the face. We struggled for the gun, with him pushing me backwards back into the house. He headbutted me and I lost my grip on the gun. Before I could even regain control over the situation I had awoken on the floor on the top floor of the house.

¬†

I ran back downstairs and did everything exactly the same as I did last time. Except when he tried to headbutt me I dodged it and retaliated with a headbutt of my own. The gun went flying. I released his hand and looked around wildly for where it had landed. I heard it land behind me. When I turned around, I saw the robber bending down to pick it up. He quickly shot me, and I awoke again. No matter how many times I die the feeling of suffocating cold numbness enveloping me never gets any better.

¬†

Once again, I did everything exactly the same as my previous attempt except this time when I headbutted him I held out my hand to where I knew the gun would land. When I grabbed it, he ran towards me and quickly ripped it from my grasp. After he shot me, I awoke more frustrated than ever. I walked over to a mirror nearby and stared into it. Inside I saw a very familiar-looking man, I man whom I knew the name of, but little else.

¬†

A man whom I was trying to free, but I was failing. I thought of the creeping feeling I felt each time I was waiting for the robber to arrive. What is this feeling? Maybe‚Ä¶ maybe I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ Maybe I‚Äôm beginning to suspect that escape is impossible. Perhaps I‚Äôm forever doomed to try in vain to escape this house, only to fail forever. While this certainly is a disturbing thought, I don‚Äôt know if it properly explains my current mood.

¬†

An even more disturbing thought crossed my mind, one that I don‚Äôt think I dared to put into words, even in my mind, up until now. Perhaps‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to escape. Perhaps I don‚Äôt want to break the loop. I thought back to the very first time the robber broke into this house, and the paralysing, all-consuming fear which devoured me. I know that for almost my entire life, I had been bone-rattlingly afraid of death.

¬†

It was never really the physical pain of death which scared me. Sure, getting eaten by a shark or burning alive all sound unpleasant but what always unsettled me about the reaper was the permanence of it all. The pain I can deal with, but the idea of not existing anymore, forever, is indescribably terrifying for me. Now inside of this loop, I‚Äôm surrounded by death, since I die about every ten minutes, but I‚Äôm shielded from that permanence. Come to think of it, I‚Äôve felt like I‚Äôve always been surrounded by death during my regular life, this time however it‚Äôs my own death. Once again, I‚Äôm struggling to remember who I even am beyond the barest basics. The difference between death within and without the loop is that here, death isn‚Äôt permanent.

¬†

I again stared at the man in the mirror, the man contemplating whether or not to live inside of a time loop to escape permanent death. Even if I can‚Äôt decide what I want to do, I think I should at least try to escape, to give myself the choice. I mean, a prisoner in jail has no choice, while an escaped prisoner can choose to go back. Now what can I do differently in this loop?

¬†

Perhaps I set some sort of trap, right after I grabbed the gun, he runs towards me. Perhaps I could put something on the ground to ensure that that doesn‚Äôt happen. I ran downstairs. After looking through the cupboard I found some tape and a kitchen knife. I taped the kitchen knife on the spot on the ground in front of where I guessed he was going to start running. I waited next to the door like I had all the previous times.

¬†

I did everything the same as I did last time. Grab. Punch. Dodge. Headbutt. Catch. When he tried to run towards me, he noticed the knife and the ground and stopped. I triumphantly aimed the gun at him.

¬†

‚ÄúCheckmate!‚Äù I shouted

¬†

‚ÄúWow, you must‚Äôve been through the loop many times,‚Äù the robber said, removing his mask. He seemed more intrigued than scared.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat!? You know about the time loop!?‚Äù I said incredulously.

¬†

‚ÄúYou look familiar, have we met before?‚Äù he asked.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you know about the time loop!?‚Äù I demanded.

  
‚ÄúQuite a lot I would say, after all, I did invent the device which generates it.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúAre you serious?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYes,‚Äù he said walking over to the whiteboard before picking up the mechanical ball which lay at its foot, ‚ÄúThis device is what starts the time loops, resets the time loops, and decides what‚Äôs on what layer of the loop a particular object is,‚Äù he explained.

¬†

‚ÄúAnd you invented that?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúYeah, I just said I did.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòlayer of the loop‚Äô?‚Äù

¬†

He pointed at the small ring of circles on the diagram on the whiteboard, ‚ÄúThese small circles represent layer one of the loops. Everything on layer one resets with the trigger event, which in this case I would assume to be‚Ä¶‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúMy death,‚Äù I said.

¬†

‚ÄúEverything on layer two remains constant between the layer one loops resetting.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúSo my body is on layer one and my consciousness on layer two?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúCorrect.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a bottle upstairs which remains smashed even after I die.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúThen that bottle would be on layer two.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWait, why did you break into my house, and why is your invention here?‚Äù I demanded  
  
‚ÄúWhat do you mean ‚Äòmy house‚Äô? This isn‚Äôt your house.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúYes, it‚Ä¶‚Äù Wait‚Ä¶ When I woke up, I just assumed that this had to be my house, but I had no proof that it was. ‚ÄúWhose house is it then?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúJames‚Äôs, he‚Äôs a colleague of mine.‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúWhy are you breaking into his house?‚Äù  
  
‚ÄúHe stole my invention, and stole that whiteboard, I came here to try to steal them back.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhy would you kill me in the previous loops?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI suppose maybe I thought you were just his partner or co-conspirator.‚Äù

¬†

I couldn‚Äôt believe it; he‚Äôd kill me over that? I‚Äôll push past it and try to find out more.

¬†

‚ÄúDo you have any idea how I might‚Äôve ended up in this situation?‚Äù I asked, ‚ÄúI just wake up each time with no memory of what happened before the loop started with a vial of heart disease medication.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, I honestly have no clue,‚Äù he replied, ‚ÄúMaybe we could figure it out together.‚Äù

¬†

Before I could scoff at what he was proposing he took a step forward and accidentally stepped on the upright knife. He howled in pain, falling to the floor.

¬†

‚ÄúReset the loop!‚Äù he shouted. I looked uncomfortably at the gun in my hands, there was only one way I could reset the loop. He seemed to notice what I was considering.

¬†

‚ÄúNot like that!‚Äù he shouted, ‚ÄúTake the device and press the button with the one on it!‚Äù I picked up the cobbled-together ball.

¬†

‚ÄúWait,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúMy name is Rick, my favourite colour is green, and my childhood dog‚Äôs name was Lenny.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúTell that to me next time you see me, so that I know we had this conversation.‚Äù

¬†

I pressed the button. The moment the button reached its lowest point I felt the usual cold envelope me before I awoke on the ground as usual. I did every single thing exactly the same as I did last time. When I aimed the gun at him, I cut off what he was about to say.

¬†

‚ÄúYour name is Rick, your favourite colour is green, and your childhood dog‚Äôs name was Lenny,‚Äù I stated.

¬†

‚ÄúWow, what happened during the last loop?‚Äù Rick asked. I quickly caught him up on everything we had spoken about.

¬†

‚ÄúSo, we were trying to figure out how you ended up in the loop?‚Äù he asked.

¬†

‚ÄúYeah,‚Äù I said, ‚ÄúAnd you said I looked familiar, so you might know something about how I got here.‚Äù

¬†

He stared at me, trying his best to place me.

¬†

‚ÄúOh no‚Ä¶‚Äù he whispered.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù I asked concerned.

¬†

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt remember a thing about your life? Not one thing?‚Äù

¬†

I nodded.

¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôm a doctor,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI work at the local hospital.‚Äù

¬†

‚ÄúWhy would a doctor invent a time loop machine?‚Äù I asked sceptically.

¬†

‚ÄúDo you have any idea how much a time loop machine would improve the medical industry? Anyways, I recognise you as a patient from that hospital, while I didn‚Äôt take your case, I did look at your file. This may not be easy to hear but‚Ä¶ you have heart failure, and according to your file‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs bad. You have‚Ä¶‚Äù he sighed, ‚ÄúA week, maybe two.‚Äù

¬†

I nearly dropped the gun. I thought of the medicine; it was so obvious all along. For all I know, I‚Äôm just as much a robber as Rick, I could‚Äôve broken in here to relieve the medical debt I could have. Even if I break the time loop, I will still die, not even in a year, not even in a month. Without realising it I had been at the end of my life the entire time, the life I could remember nothing about, but that was nonetheless nearing its close. Even if I remain within the time loop, what kind of life will that be? Will I just spend a week in a hospital bed, forever?

¬†

I would do anything to forget what he had just told me, to go back to the ignorance which had graciously befallen me before. I had escaped, since I could of course easily just run away, but at what cost? Even if I leave this house, I will be doomed to return to it, forever. I am a prisoner who had just escaped into a larger, worse prison. I looked down at the spherical device which had both trapped me yet also shielded me from the truth, the truth that my life was now over. I picked it up and observed it.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat would happen if I pressed the ‚Äò2‚Äô button here?‚Äù I asked.

¬†

‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt want to do that,‚Äù Rick said.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat would happen?‚Äù I demanded.

¬†

‚ÄúIf you press that everything on both layers one and two will reset. That includes your consciousness. That means that if you press that button everything, from the first time you woke up to now, will happen exactly the same way, indefinably.‚Äù

¬†

My hand was hovering above the button. If I press it, I will forget everything, including the fact that I‚Äôm dying. If I don‚Äôt press it, I spend an uncountable number of weeks rotting away in a hospital bed until I probably choose to stop the loop and end it all. If I press it, I will at least have the illusion of a life to escape to, a mirage to keep me moving forward. I can either know my fate forever or forever be free of its burden. I made my choice. I could see Rick realised what I was about to do.

¬†

‚ÄúNOOO!‚Äù he shouted while lunging forward, it was too late. I pressed the button. I felt the cold not only numb my body but also begin to wash away my memories, I surrendered to its freezing tranquillity.

¬†

I awoke with a start. I felt like I was choking on something. My face hurt like I was just hit. Where am I? I don‚Äôt remember a thing. Wait‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt remember a thing! Do I have amnesia? I looked around, I was in a living room, and I didn‚Äôt seem to be in any immediate danger. What do I remember? Let me start at the basics, my name is Gerald Graham, my job is‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ I live at‚Ä¶ um‚Ä¶ This isn‚Äôt a good start. Where am I anyway, and how did I get here? I‚Äôm in a living room, is this my house? If it is this is a nice place. I looked out the window, I was on the second floor of the house.

¬†

The house had a massive garden surrounded by three-metre-high walls. It seemed to be night, near the window was a grandfather clock, it was eleven past nine. I realised I was holding something; it was a vial of Lacocelex. What is Lacocelex again? I think it‚Äôs that new experimental drug meant to lessen some of the symptoms of heart disease, though in overuse it can have the side effect of temporary memory loss. Wait‚Ä¶ How the hell do I know all that?

¬†

\--

¬†

Rick pulled into his parking space outside his house. He checked the time; it was one past nine. Rick was on a call.

¬†

‚ÄúThe last week has been rough,‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe she‚Äôs gone. There is still so much I would‚Äôve wanted to say to her.‚Äù  
  


He entered his home, ‚ÄúAnd guess what my boss told me today?‚Äù he said holding back tears, ‚ÄúApparently, I took too much time off work to grieve. I‚Äôm fired, and I don‚Äôt think any other engineering firm would hire me‚Ä¶ Yeah, I know that, it‚Äôs just I can‚Äôt afford a lawyer. I can‚Äôt even afford this house anymore, all our savings‚Ä¶ well all my savings were spent on her medical expenses. I‚Äôm going to have to move. A month ago, I had a wife, I had a job, I had a house, I had a life!‚Äù he broke down crying.

¬†

‚ÄúThank you‚Ä¶ Thank you‚Ä¶ that means a lot‚Ä¶‚Äù Rick said to the person on the other end. He stared at the time loop device, ‚ÄúUnfortunately I can‚Äôt do that, I thought it was too risky to put her in a time loop, and now I‚Äôll always regret that‚Ä¶‚Äù

¬†

He walked to his kitchen, taking out a mug to make himself coffee, ‚ÄúI know‚Ä¶ I know‚Ä¶‚Äù he said, ‚ÄúI know I shouldn‚Äôt blame myself, but you know who I do blame!? That damn doctor! Dr. Gerald Graham! If he had noticed that she had heart failure earlier, she would‚Äôve never died and I‚Äôd be pouring her a glass to drink right now‚Ä¶ Yeah! It was his incompetence which ended her life‚Ä¶ No, I already spoke with the police, they say that there is nothing I can do, but if you ask me that guy deserves to be thrown in jail! He ruined my life!‚Äù

¬†

Rick heard another call, ‚ÄúHold on I‚Äôll call you back, I‚Äôm getting another call.‚Äù He switched to the other call, ‚ÄúHello, who is this?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey, it‚Äôs Dr. Graham. I came here to‚Ä¶ apologise. I‚Äôm at your gate right now, please open it for me,‚Äù the voice on the other end said. Rick immediately grabbed his keys and pressed the button to open the gate. He watched out his window as he saw the car approach. Instinct taking over, Rick waited in front of the front door. When he heard the knock on the door, he immediately opened the door and punched Gerald in the face. Gerald fell to the ground. Rick stared down at his body, in shock at what he had just done.

¬†

He dragged Gerald inside. What should he do now? Could he blame some sort of crime on Gerald? The prospect of getting him locked up was appealing but he didn‚Äôt fancy his chances as an unemployed person vs a wealthy doctor. Rick remembered the gun he kept on his nightstand for self-defence, he shuddered, if there was one thing he would not do now, it was use that. The idea of permanently ending another‚Äôs life made him want to vomit. He looked down at Gerland in disgust, Gerald was the killer, not him.

¬†

Although, that gave him an idea. Perhaps he shouldn‚Äôt *permanently* end his life. He picked up the time loop device. He shined the green light it produced into Gerald‚Äôs eye. Gerald began regaining consciousness.

¬†

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ who‚Ä¶‚Äù Gerald whispered. Rick pressed the button labelled ‚ÄòX‚Äô on the spherical device. Gerald began horribly shaking, a moment later the light turned blue, and he stopped shaking, having passed out again. The device had just linked to his consciousness, ensuring that whenever it reset time the consciousness would remain constant until the second layer loop is reset. Rick dragged Gerald up the steps by the wrist, carrying the device in his other hand. It might be better to have him wake up on the top floor.

¬†

Rick noticed the vail of Lacocelex on his table, it was the medication his wife was taking near the end. He could remember how she would have temporary memory loss whenever she took it, it broke his heart that she would constantly forget who he was, before remembering once its effects wore off.

¬†

‚ÄúYou‚Äôll spend an eternity not even knowing who you are,‚Äù Rick said, grabbing the Lacocelex and shoving a handful of its contents down Gerald‚Äôs throat. ‚ÄúThe police won't trap you in jail, so I‚Äôm going to trap you in my prison of time. I may have to shoot you a couple of times, but you‚Äôll be okay, you‚Äôll wake up again.‚Äù  
  
Rick shuddered at the thought of having to shoot Gerald, he‚Äôd have to get it into his mind that what he was doing wouldn‚Äôt be permanent. ‚ÄúAs the loops progress, you‚Äôll probably get smart, you might even figure out what I‚Äôve done to you. In that case, once I‚Äôve felt like you‚Äôve experienced enough loops, I‚Äôll hit the ‚Äò2‚Äô button, and then everything will happen again, forever.‚Äù

¬†

A gleeful thought crossed Rick‚Äôs mind, he picked up Gerald‚Äôs hand and placed it on the device‚Äôs button labelled ‚Äò2‚Äô. He pressed down. The device‚Äôs light flickered, and from now on all the loops would reset from this point, but since the only constant was Gerald‚Äôs consciousness and since he was still passed out, no change would occur between the loops until Gerald awoke.

¬†

‚ÄúI think it would be great if you choose to press the button,‚Äù Rick said smiling, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll have to figure out how to convince you to do that, but I think I can do it.‚Äù The idea that Gerald might willingly choose to trap himself made Rick‚Äôs revenge all the sweeter.

¬†

‚ÄúGoodbye,‚Äù Rick said, ‚ÄúSee you soon.‚Äù He put the gun from his nightstand into his pocket. He walked down the stairs, leaving the device at the foot of the whiteboard. He climbed into his car and drove away, pondering what would proceed. He parked just outside his gate. What was going to be just a couple of minutes wait for him, was going to be an eternity‚Äôs worth of punishment for Gerald. As the clock struck eleven past nine, on the second floor of the house which Rick had made their prison, Gerald awoke with a start...",1,1739394103.0,BetaReaders,2,1.0,False

With its sleek design and compact size, it fits seamlessly into my small kitchen. I‚Äôve used it for everything from grinding coffee beans to pulverizing spices for my homemade Indian recipes, and it‚Äôs proven its worth time and time again. Its modern black finish gives it a stylish edge, and honestly, I‚Äôm not ashamed to leave it out on the counter even when guests come over.

The build quality feels solid, with durable stainless steel blades that haven‚Äôt dulled even after extensive use. Despite its lightweight construction, weighing just 1.38 pounds, it doesn‚Äôt feel flimsy. The grinder‚Äôs compact dimensions (7.72 x 4.41 x 4.33 inches) make it perfect for small kitchens or tight storage spaces. I‚Äôve dropped it once (oops), and it didn‚Äôt skip a beat. However, it‚Äôs worth noting that the lid could feel sturdier, as I sometimes worry about it cracking under pressure.

[Check Mueller MLR010555N cost on Amazon.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/mueller-mlr010555n-grinder-review-b08wc8tyxl/)

When it comes to grinding performance, this little machine doesn‚Äôt disappoint. It delivers consistent results whether you need a coarse grind for French press or a fine powder for espresso. I‚Äôve even ventured into grinding spices like nutmeg and cardamom, and the results were just as impressive. The grinding speed is fast, and while it‚Äôs not whisper-quiet, it‚Äôs manageable and less noisy than expected. I‚Äôve read some reviews complaining about its single-speed operation, but honestly, I find it straightforward and effective. Simplicity can be a blessing, especially when you haven‚Äôt had your morning coffee yet.

The grinding mechanism is a blade system, not burr, which might deter hardcore coffee enthusiasts. Burr grinders are typically praised for producing more uniform grounds, which can enhance coffee flavor. That said, for someone like me who enjoys convenience and versatility, this blade grinder is a solid choice. It‚Äôs quicker and remarkably efficient, especially if you‚Äôre grinding in small batches.

Ease of use is another highlight. There are no complicated settings or buttons to decipher. You just add your ingredients, pop on the lid, and press down to grind. It‚Äôs intuitive and perfect for those of us who don‚Äôt want to read a manual every time we make coffee. Cleaning, however, could be easier. Since the blades are sharp, I‚Äôve had to resort to using a small brush or air sprayer to get rid of leftover particles. It would‚Äôve been nice if it came with a cleaning tool.

Capacity-wise, the grinder holds up to 2.1 ounces, which is great for single servings or small households. However, if you‚Äôre brewing for a crowd, you‚Äôll find yourself grinding multiple batches. My coworker borrowed it for a family brunch and had to grind beans three times to meet their coffee needs. She loved the grind quality but wished it had a larger hopper.

**Pros**

* Compact and stylish, perfect for small spaces.
* Consistent and efficient grinding performance.
* Simple, intuitive operation.
* Multi-purpose: handles coffee beans, spices, nuts, and more.
* Durable stainless steel blades that hold up over time.

**Cons**

* Small capacity may not suit large households.
* Single-speed operation limits customization.
* Cleaning can be a bit tricky without a brush.
* Lid feels a bit fragile and could be more robust.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to larger burr grinders like the Baratza Encore, the Mueller MLR010555N is more compact and significantly more affordable. While the Baratza offers superior precision for coffee aficionados, it lacks the versatility of grinding spices and other ingredients. On the flip side, the popular Cuisinart DBM-8 burr grinder offers adjustable settings but takes up more counter space and is less portable. The Mueller grinder excels in convenience and ease of use, making it ideal for casual coffee drinkers and home chefs.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

Is the Mueller grinder worth the investment? Absolutely, if you‚Äôre looking for an affordable, reliable grinder that handles more than just coffee beans. It‚Äôs not perfect, and it doesn‚Äôt have the precision of a burr grinder, but for the price, it delivers exceptional versatility and consistent results. Whether you‚Äôre grinding coffee for a morning pick-me-up or crushing spices for dinner, this grinder won‚Äôt let you down.

1io1ctr,https://www.reddit.com/r/BorderlinePDisorder/comments/1io1ctr/how_do_i_cut_off_someone_who_unintentionally/,How do I cut off someone who unintentionally affects my mental health?,"Hey, 

I'm (31F) looking for some advice as to what to do with someone who I know. I think I need to cut him off but I'm not sure how to do that. I have BPD and that's obviously making things worse, I'm going through a horrible time and yo-yoing between different personalities which is exhausting. 

This is a bit long so I apologise but I wanted to put in as much as possible. 

So for the past 4 years I feel like I have just been having crisis after crisis, and very big life changing one's, which I can't take a break from. We moved to the part of the country I'm in 5yrs ago, with my fianc√© (who I have been with 8yrs now). I've never really had any consistent friends, and other than work ones I've not had a lot of other people. Due to various factors (management) at the work place I was at I ended up leaving and that's when everything went downhill, I won't go too much into detail about everything as I will be here all day. I knew I needed people in my life, and I needed something for me, so I joined a musical theatre group (4yrs ago) There I met some amazing people who I genuinely thought I would have forever (this is a consistent theme I have with every blossoming friend group) these guys were different though, they made me realise that they would actually be there for me and actually do anything for me, which is stuff I have never experienced before, I was always the one making effort and being there for others and listening to them. Anyway, one of them, Ray, and I used to talk a lot, we wouldn't meet alone but would be part of social gatherings with our friends. He was quite reserved and shy but friendly, everyone loved him, although didn't know him as well as I did. We tended to have deep meaningful conversations via messenger a lot, for the next 4 years this was kept up, we would speak fairly consistently with probably 2 weeks being the longest gap in between speaking. As well as Ray there were other friends who I would speak a lot to from that group. We were in some of the shows the group did together, and other shows we didn't do or only 1 of us did. I felt I could rely on him and talk to him about a lot, if I messaged and he didn't get back right away I'd say the longest he would go before replying would be a day with an apology. 

Anyway moving onto about 6 months ago. Ray messaged and confessed he has feelings for me and has for a long time, he knew I probably wouldn't be interested because he knew I was in a relationship. Months to this prior Ray had been saying stuff about needing to get his head straight and various things which made a lot more sense because of it. He told me when he first met me it had started. I messaged back thanking him for letting me know, that I wasn't interested in him, and hoping that by him telling me it would at least help him to move on, now he has answers. We both continued talking for a bit about how we really value our friendship and hoped that things wouldn't change. At this point we were both in a show together, so it was inevitable we would both see each other. I imagine it was just as nerve wracking for him as it was for me to see each other face-to-face, but I made the first move to show I wouldn't be awkward and things could be normal, I think from then on we both fell back into how we used to be.

Moving on, to December, I feel like my life went down the drain at this point. There was a show I wanted to do and so did he. The audition day came, and I had completely lost my voice, after talking to other people they convinced me to go anyway as they would be able to see past this (this was a singing audition) I tried my best, painstakingly squeaking the song, whilst trying to add characterisation as much as possible. I didn't get asked to call backs and didn't get in the show. This was heartbreaking for me, there was a number of reasons I needed to be in the show, but to be rejected, especially because of my singing (I've always sang, I have qualifications in singing, and have never been rejected before) was so painful, I felt so worthless, I picked myself up and decided to get the feedback to do better next time and use it as an opportunity despite dying inside from being rejected, how much I needed this group and from being embarrassed. I got told my audition was good I wasn't vocally strong enough, which I can't argue with the not being vocally strong enough as I had no voice, I fought for more feedback, without avail so ultimately I feel bitter about it, on top of that there is always speculation about favourites. Anyway, I believe my BPD/RSD/ADHD/depression/anxiety played a lot into the complete pain and devastation I felt (and still feel) 

Around Christmas time it felt like all of my friends had dropped off the face of the planet, I felt so lonely. I had a horrible Christmas and I ended up being so busy. I carried on telling myself friends weren't talking to me because they have lives outside of me, it's Christmas, of course they're not going to be glued to their phones wanting to talk to me. It was hard, as all I wanted to do was talk to people, but I knew logically. Ray was one of those people. 

January came, people slowly started reappearing and some not at all. Ray and I organised a coffee and catch up as we hadn't spoken. It was lovely, he also let me know he had found someone, I was so happy for him! I told him I had felt lonely over Christmas and how I felt that a load of people had abandoned me, he apologised about how he hadn't been talking to me, I told him it's absolutely fine, its more a ""me thing"" than a him thing, it's just it all happened when I felt down and felt it all happened at the same time, but I understand why,  its just sad some people just stopped all together. 

Time went on, Ray was barely talking to me, when he did reply it was brief, I would always be the last one left on read. It was painful, I felt like I was grieving, I felt so conflicted. On one hand I had told him how lonely and down I had been when people hadn't replied, he even seemed to acknowledge and apologise for it, I guess I downplayed it a bit when he did that but on the other he had had feelings for me, he had a gf, so probably trying to detach from me and physically seeing her more, which again I can completely understand. It hurts so bad though.

 It's something growing up happened a lot with male friends, I would have, what I considered, very close, good friendship with men, then if I got into a relationship, suddenly everyone dispersed and I'd never see them again, it was traumatic because I didn't see the situation any other way than we get along well and common interests and then they would go or they would get into a relationship and that was that. So you would think I would learn, especially since its a reoccurring theme. The only difference being I knew Ray for 4 yrs whilst being in a relationship, he hasn't completely stopped contact, but I'm not sure if this is worse. 

I got really upset when everything went pear shaped for me, who I didn't have around me was apparent. I wrote off my car, my fianc√© broke up with me (we are back together now) and I was car-less, and for a while (kinda) homeless as I couldn't be in the same house as my ex because how difficult it all was. There was other things on top of that all going wrong as well but they were the main things, I also tried to end it all.

 I did the first crazy thing with Ray, I'd always talked about stupid stuff I'd done when splitting or said, but I'd never done it to him, after him not replying to me again I sent him a double message something along the lines of ""okay, I get you don't want to speak, but please let me know you're okay"" ...... admittedly that sounds relatively tame for using the word ""crazy"" but it was the most crazy I had said to him. He did message back saying he had been very busy with everything and asked how I had been. I apologised and briefly told him, he sympathised with my situation and then stopped talking.

 I now felt even worse for letting that side out, him recognising it then going back to not speaking, his mannerisms over the past weeks had been getting more clinical. I knew I had to cut myself off from him, which I did.... days went on, he messaged me and I went against that and messaged back, brief conversation, I knew he had an evening to himself -  to be left on read. We then met up last week, I had asked him for a coffee, and it was lovely, he apologised again for not being great with messages, I apologised I had been going a bit crazy, then back to being left on seen... 

I forgot to mention since December I have had a Facebook purge, I know it's not good for my mental health so I came off. This week I logged back on, because I lost someone incredibly close to me, it's broken me again when I just was starting to push forwards with life. I put a post up on Facebook, as well as the pain I'm feeling for this loss - no one has checked in to see if I'm okay. Its been a few days, I know any one of my friends I would check in, there were ""likes"" on the post, including Ray a few scattered old friends commented, which was nice, but no one messaged me.

 Kind of hits me how little I mean to people who I idolised. Thankfully I have my partner by my side, who has been amazing. 

I havent heard off Ray, and it's all making me feel crazy, was he my ""friend"" with the hope of one day just getting in my pants despite the fact I was in a relationship? What should I do? Is cutting off the right thing to do for me and my mental health - how do I do it? I know if he sends me a message I'm there for it. 

I want to make it clear even if I had been single I would not have started a relationship with Ray, and I don't have any romantic feelings for him. My BPD gets like this with people, male or female (I'm straight) where I do obsess and I do go from pure anger and wanting to be off, push them away and wanting to show them how much they're hurting me to suddenly apologising and now wanting to stay. I've already mentioned the only thing I think has been said that's bad. I don't think he's wrong at all, I think I'm the one in the wrong, I know why I'm like this, I resent the fact this is a recurring thing which I haven't identified I've always believed ""boys and girls can be friends with nothing there"" despite life showing me otherwise, I don't know why I can't believe my own reality over perceived beliefs. Through all of this, I'm trying to do ""the right thing"" as it's painful for me, and I don't want to do the wrong thing, somehow I haven't had a major split on him. 

What do I do, hit me with home truths, and how should I navigate this?

It seemed like it was a ritual to openly accept a spirit or demon into a person, rather than expelling it out. It was one of my most frightening experiences in a spiritual sense. 

This group formed a circle on the floor in a dark, black room, were they proceeded to light candles. they sat around the circle and began to chant. they requested I stay in the corner of the room. they didnt want me near the circle, as I was just the medium watching over the procedure. There were exactly 6 of us and it was a full moon. 2 of us guys and 4 women.
They told me they were trying to exercise a demon out of one of the women so she was in the middle of the circle. The other guy that was with us went into the circle and was almost wrestling her. While this is going on and everybody involved is fully entranced into the middle of the circle. At the end of it, the room went black.The candles blew out on their own, everything went quiet. Soon after one of these people turned on the light and acted as if nothing had happened out of the ordinary and everybody met in the lobby and had some coffee and then took off. I don't know what to make of it, but it didn't feel right. It didn't feel safe or cleansed.

I stopped hanging out with that group soon after that.Given what I can see compared to what they could actually see. 

This group of people had a sense to lure me in. They knew that I had abilities. They knew all of it and they expressed that they wanted me to be part of their group and be a community. Things got a little weird before this happened but this experince was the last straw..

Hey folks, so this is D and yes this is my story and apparently i am living in it.

Let's go further.

I swear I didn‚Äôt see this coming. Like at all. I mean, 10,000 miles? Melbourne? Some dude I met on Hinge? Yeah, this was never in the plan. But here we are.

Let‚Äôs back up. So, I barely even use dating apps. Swiping through Hinge? Boring as hell. But one random day, I did it anyway, and boom the dude pops up. Indian guy, living in Melbourne, looking all sophisticated and proper. The type who probably sips black coffee while reading financial news or something. Not my vibe, right?

But for some reason, I swiped right. And guess what? We matched. Cool, whatever. I figured it‚Äôd just be another one of those ‚Äúhey, how‚Äôs your day?‚Äù conversations that go nowhere.

Except then I went and did something wild I straight-up gave him my number in one go. No hesitation, no second thought. What the actual hell, D? Who even does that?

After that first chat, I was like, ‚ÄúNah, this isn‚Äôt it.‚Äù Too polished. Too sophisticated. So, naturally, I ignored him. End of story, right? Wrong.

One day, while I was sitting around bored out of my mind, I texted him:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm Sorry, I forgot about your text. TRUST ME. I don‚Äôt really use WhatsApp.‚Äù Lmfao what an ass i am. 

Which, by the way, was total bullshit. I just didn‚Äôt know what else to say.

But guess what? He didn‚Äôt even flinch. We kept talking, and somehow it clicked. Conversations started flowing. He made me laugh without even trying, and before I knew it, I was actually looking forward to hearing from him.

And now? Now I‚Äôm sitting here thinking, ‚ÄúWhat the hell is happening?‚Äù We‚Äôre 10,000 miles apart, planning to meet, and I‚Äôm catching feelings for this guy who wasn‚Äôt even supposed to be on my radar.

If this ever turns into something serious, I‚Äôm gonna have to tell my kids ‚ÄúYeah, I met your dad on Hinge. Was bored out of my mind and accidentally fell for him. ‚ÄúThey'd probably roll their eyes and be like, seriously, mom?

Anyway, We kept talking, talking and TALKING.
Before I knew it, everything started feeling like some dreamy Bollywood romance or those fairytale books I read as a kid. The kind where the guy surprises you, stays when you're sick, makes you laugh when you're crying, and just loves you like you're the only person on earth.
But I was stubborn. I told myself, Nope.
Don't fall for this guy. I tried to control it all
my feelings, my heart, my emotions.
Spoiler alert: I failed.
So, in typical Daissy fashion, I decided to test him. I told him, ""You need to pass 30 stages to win me over."" Lmfao. There were no actual stages it was just a random number I pulled out of nowhere. I just wanted to see if he'd actually try.
Because honestly? I want someone who loves me like it's just me and him against the world. The kind of guy who sticks around when I'm sick, surprises me when I least expect it, and doesn't run when I'm on my chaotic periods or having a breakdown.
And you know what? Maybe, just maybe, this wild longdistance story is exactly that.

Also, not gonna lie, I'm 21 (well, almost 22), so yeah, I think about kids. And you know what I realized? If a guy can be a great dad, he'll also be the best partner. I want someone who can tell his daughter how she deserves to be treated. And somewhere in my heart, I believe Arjun might just be that guy.
It's weird, right? I barely know him, yet he's already putting my heart at ease. His presence is just enough. I don't need anything fancy just him.
And here I am, writing this like it's a therapy session. But I guess sometimes life throws you curveballs, and instead of dodging, you just say, Screw it, I'm catching this one.

**Dark, Empty Dawn**



Snow is a soft unifier  
Coldly blurring color and lines.  
Its first exhalation is silk  
That spreads in the dark, empty dawn  
Across tipped lawn chairs, abandoned after their summer fling,  
Filling their checkerboard of plastic slats  
Molding everything into a single plane of white,  
Subsuming frigid cars, bushes, naked trees,  
Indecently late ornaments, tired siding, roofs.  
This cosmic peace the more precious for its fragility;  
For soon the first squares of light in the first bedroom windows will be lit  
And the first eyes wonder at all the snow  
Followed by the pants and shoes and coffee of a new day  
And the jagged slits where the cars reverse and tear the morning  
Into shreds.

For the first time in a long while, I feel like I‚Äôm starting to heal. I‚Äôm finally moving on from what we had. This person cycles though my brain from time to time, especially when people ask me about my past.

It all started in June of 2013. I was swiping on Tinder, like some of us do, and then I saw his profile. He stood out like no one else did. A 6‚Äô2"", 31-year-old Chinese guy from the Upper East Side of Manhattan. My heart raced as I stared at his picture, unsure of what to do. Should I swipe left? Should I swipe right? My mind was racing. And honestly? I didn‚Äôt feel worthy of someone like him. I (I‚Äôm Guyanese) was an overweight 20-years-old, 5‚Äô8‚Äù and 235 pounds. Who would want someone like me? Those were the thoughts running through my mind. And I just kept thinking, look at me. If you could see me then, you‚Äôd understand. And if you saw him? Well, most people would understand why I thought I didn‚Äôt stand a chance.

But I swiped right anyway. And instantly, panic set in. I closed the app and jumped in the shower to distract myself. Afterward, I made a cup of tea and went back to my room to watch a Thai show to calm my nerves. But then, my phone buzzed. It was a Tinder notification. I had a match. My heart raced. It was him. I felt so confused, and honestly, kind of shocked. I was staring at my phone like, *How?* *Why me?* How could someone like him, so put together, so good-looking... be interested in someone like me? (I was at a point in my life where I had zero self-confidence. I had been called ugly for so long. And once, someone saw a family photo of me and said, ‚ÄúWait, so who are these people?‚Äù When I told them it was my mom, brother, and sister, they asked, ‚ÄúWait, what happened to you? Why do you look like that?‚Äù That was just one of many painful moments).

But then he messaged me. We talked for a week, and I had to ask him: *Why did you swipe right on me?* He told me I was cute. And I said, ‚ÄúYou do know I‚Äôm fat, right?‚Äù And he said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care. I think it‚Äôs cute that you‚Äôre chubby.‚Äù I didn‚Äôt know what to say to that, but it made me happy... happier than I‚Äôd been in a long time. I told him I was trying to lose weight, but I didn‚Äôt know where to start. He said, ‚ÄúIf you ever need help, I‚Äôm here for you.‚Äù For the first time, I felt like someone accepted me... just as I was.

Our conversations moved from Tinder to texting, then to phone calls, then to FaceTime. I felt like I was living in a dream. For the first time in my life, I felt happiness in a way I didn‚Äôt know was possible. When he would text or call, I couldn‚Äôt help but smile, even when family was around. I wasn‚Äôt even aware of it sometimes. My family could tell something was going on because they saw the way I would light up when my phone rang or when I was texting him. But I never told them the truth.

(I didn‚Äôt come out to my family until I was 27-years-old. They knew I was gay, but I never confirmed it because, growing up, I was constantly told how wrong it was. Not by my mom or siblings, but by the extended family. I have a big family and we all used to live together. It was suffocating.) I was constantly told I wasn‚Äôt good enough and to keep to myself. But with him, I felt seen and accepted, and I finally told him everything. He was in a similar situation, but he had already come out to his family. His parents weren‚Äôt okay with it, but they accepted it. He said they just didn‚Äôt want to meet his partner.

We made it work, though. I would sneak out during the day when my family was at work or school, and we‚Äôd spend time together. I‚Äôd tell them I was at Barnes & Noble, which was my safe haven, my excuse, my cover story. They never questioned it because they knew how much I loved being there.

I‚Äôll never forget the first time we met in person. I remember the first time we met in person. He gave me the biggest hug. It was like he had been waiting for me I could just feel that he genuinely liked me. And I knew this is real. When I was with him, I felt safe, and for once, I felt like I could sleep. I had trouble sleeping before meeting him, I could go 33hrs without sleep and when I would sleep it would be no more than 6hrs. But when he held me, I would drift off, feeling so comfortable, so warm, so protected. After 3 weeks of dating he told me he loved me, I was shocked and didn‚Äôt know what to say, but before I could respond he said it‚Äôs okay of I‚Äôm not there yet or comfortable because he knew how much I cared for him and that my actions spoke louder than anything.

Three months in, things were going perfectly. I was back to babysitting, which I loved‚Äîtaking care of kids, cooking for them, helping with their homework, making them laugh. It was such a fulfilling part of my life. And when we FaceTime, he‚Äôd see me with the kids, and he‚Äôd call me the perfect housewife. It made me laugh, but it was true. I loved taking care of people. I started doing the same things for him, and it felt so natural, so right.

But then November came, and I told my family I was going out with friends. It was a lie. I didn‚Äôt have friends. I was just going out with him. We had dinner by the pier, then went to the movies, and afterward, we strolled through Central Park. It was an amazing night, but something was off. I couldn‚Äôt put my finger on it, but I felt it.

Before we parted ways, he hugged me again, and it felt different this time. Then, he started to cry. I asked him what was wrong, and he told me something I never wanted to hear. He said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but I have to go back to China. My grandmother‚Äôs sick, and my parents need me.‚Äù

I pulled him into another hug, and I started crying too. We talked for hours, but in the end, we both knew that long distance was going to be too much, and we didn‚Äôt know when he would be back. So, we decided to end things.

We still spent time together. We went to Roosevelt Mall. I was with him when he went into the LV store, knowing full well I could never afford anything in there. But I saw this jacket that I loved. He was getting ready to pay for the items he picked out. I left the store to buy us coffee. He dropped me a few blocks away from my house. I hugged him tightly, and we shared a kiss, one that felt like a silent promise. When I got to my room, I began unpacking the sweaters I had picked up from H&M. But at the bottom of the bag there was something unexpected... the LV jacket I had been eyeing earlier. My heart skipped a beat. I immediately called him, my voice shaky as I asked why he‚Äôd gotten it for me. He told me it was a parting gift, something to remember him by. He wanted me to have it, to have something special from him. I told him it would never fit me. But his response was gentle. ‚ÄúWell, you‚Äôre trying to lose weight,‚Äù he said, ‚Äúso when you do, you‚Äôll have it to wear.‚Äù His words hit me harder than I expected, a mix of warmth and hope that somehow made me believe in myself a little more than I had before.

Two weeks later, I helped him pack, and we shared one final kiss under the steps at the airport. I watched him walk away until he disappeared from my sight, and in that moment, my heart shattered. The person who made me feel loved, who made me feel safe, was gone. I felt broken.

As time went on, I ate my feelings, and though we stayed in touch, it wasn‚Äôt the same. I missed him more than I could put into words.

Fast forward to 2024. I‚Äôve lost weight. I‚Äôm down to 205 pounds, and that jacket fits now. I wore it on my birthday, and it brought all these memories flooding back. I FaceTime him that night, and I was happy, but there was this ache that I couldn‚Äôt shake. I still missed him.

He‚Äôs in a relationship now, and I‚Äôm genuinely happy for him. But the truth is, I still think about him from time to time even though I shouldn‚Äôt. I called him on his birthday, and we had a great conversation. I told him I had gone on a few dates, but they all ended badly. He told me to remember its not me its them. I always love the way he knew what to say. He told me he was in a good place, and that made me smile.

But then, Halloween came, and I got a call from Jason, someone I‚Äôd been talking to for almost two months. I liked him. But then I saw him in the mall with a girl, and I found out the girl he was with was his girlfriend. I cut him off immediately. He tried to explain, but I wasn‚Äôt having it. That same night, I got a call from China. He told me we couldn‚Äôt talk anymore. His partner didn‚Äôt like how he spoke about me. We said our final goodbye.

That night, I went to a Halloween party, and for the first time in my life, I drank my feelings. I got drunk for the first time, even though I've been drinking from a long time.  I cried in front of people, which I‚Äôd never done before not even in front of my family.

But now, in 2025, I‚Äôm learning to let go. I‚Äôve deleted everything related to him from my phone, (if I got a new phone I would always transfer everything over because seeing his pictures and messages brought me comfort) but the memories are still in my old phone. I‚Äôll never completely delete them because they‚Äôre a part of me now. They helped shape who I am.

And so, after all these years, I have a confession. A confession I wanted to make the day we went to the pier. Wei, you were my first true love. I wish I had done this face to face. I love you, and I always will have love for you. But things happen for a reason and maybe this was the way things were meant to be. Even though we don‚Äôt talk anymore, I hope you‚Äôre happy, thriving, and living your best life. I hope you‚Äôve accomplished everything you set out to do. If you already have, then I‚Äôm so proud of you. Wherever life takes you I know you will do great things, and what every guy you end up with will be one lucky person to have you.

As for me? I‚Äôm still single, but I‚Äôm happy. I‚Äôm learning to love myself, and I‚Äôve found people who see me for who I am. I‚Äôm slowly starting to put myself out there again, though dating in 2025 feels like a different world. It‚Äôs tough when almost everyone seems to be looking for sex on the first date, open relationships, non-monogamy, or throuples. None of that is for me. I can‚Äôt sleep with someone unless there‚Äôs real intimate connection. I would never do open/shared relationships, nothing against it, its just not for me. As for people who can sleep around, I envy you and sometimes I wish could. And yes, if anyone wants to know, Wei was the last person I‚Äôve ever slept with.

But over the years, I've finally found friendships that make me feel seen, valued, and understood. I‚Äôm not the same person I was back then. I‚Äôve found a bit of confidence, even though I still struggle with it sometimes.

I‚Äôm still working on myself, and maybe one day I‚Äôll be ready to love again and finally say it to their face. Also I'm working on my first book, that should be completed this year.

I (25F) got to a point where I'm slowly avoiding a friend (26F) because in my eyes she proves to not know me based off how she reacts when we talk, even if we've been friends for 2 years and spending a lot of time together. 

Our common friend noticed, I told her about my pov and she said to just ignore it and not take it personally, that some people are like that. Aside from whether or not I believe that, I want to know from an outside perspective if I'm being stubborn and unreasonable, or my pov is understandable. 


When I tell her about something happening, she always assumes that I'm this bad person who always does something wrong. 

Just to name two that personally offended me:

1. Told her about how I was trying to get two gay guys I know to go out since they don't know each other but they seem each other types, she asked ""wait, so you just outed him by telling the other guy that he's gay?"" of course I didn't, i asked both separately if I could show pics to the other to see if it was a match. I'd never do such a thing, especially since I'm bisexual myself and did get outed in the past at work. 

2. I stream in my free time and did a charity stream and talking about the gaming controllers for people with disabilities, then gave a shout out to a person who also streams who uses one of those. She said ""well, but what if he didn't want people to know that he's differently abled?"". Not only he has a webcam when streaming for everyone to see, I also texted him in private to make sure he was okay with it. 


To me, comments/questions like this are insulting because she knows me, she knows the type of person I am and it's obvious that I'd never do this or that thing, for her to ask me about it means that she thinks I would. If a friend tells me a story, I would never assume that my friend is an asshole. And again, this weren't even advices I was asking, just us out for a coffee having a yapping session.

32F on 200mg Zoloft for anxiety. 

I have a history of fainting that started when I was 3. 

Cardio and EP appts and tests throughout my life that always came back with no significant findings and diagnosed with vasovagal syncope. 

I have fainted in hospitals that had nursing say it was a seizure - Neuro work ups were always NSF. 

My dogs can let me know I'm gonna have an episode before I start to feel dizzy. Relevant? Idk?

August I got cleared by cardio to start Vyvanse for ADHD per my psychiatrist. Clear echo, ekg, and bloodwork. November I had an appt with my pcp who said my heart was doing the salsa. 10 day holter later and PVC's with a 17% burden is happening. I just got in with cardio in January, stopped the Vyvanse in November, just got an echo last week. 

I started on metoprolol. It sucks. It tanks my bp and hr. I'm skipping every other dose due to parameters. I'm calling my cardio office every week telling them this. 

I'm tired. I've had significant weight gain (about 50lbs so I'm 180lbs) within the year. I'm grumpy. I've cut alcohol and caffeine (prob a coffee twice a week realistically) and have been eating a heart healthy diet since November.

I'm going crazy over here. Is there anything I can do at home that might help? What happens if medicine doesn't help? Just looking for some insight really.

""He hasn't touched me since we found out I was pregnant. But for the last two months, he's certainly touched her. I saw them together, after hours, outside of where she works, in an intimate embrace.""
_______________
Paige Garcia 
I cradle my belly as I sit in the deceptively uncomfortable chair. It's aesthetically pleasing and fits in well with the d√©cor, but my tailbone protests as I shift around again. It could also be that I'm 6 months pregnant and waiting in an office for a meeting I never thought I'd need.
""I know we are young, Paige, everyone keeps reminding us. But since I saw you sitting in 7th grade English with the ultimate resting bimbo face, I've never wanted another and I don't see that changing. You are my whole world, marry me and let's build something spectacular.""
This isn't my life. At least not the one I'd planned out dreaming under the stars with my middle school sweetheart. it's not even the one I considered when Tommy first started pulling away. I thought he needed time to sort something out, maybe going through an early mid-life crisis, or depression.
""Mom told me about this app that we can use to share our locations. I was thinking with me being almost 5 months along, it might be a good idea in case something happens.""
""Don't be dramatic. And quit listening to your mom. We don't need to track each other.""
""Tommy, it's a simple download, then we share our locations--""
""No, Paige. I'm an adult, and you aren't my mom.""
The finality of what is about to happen...my stomach churns with the weight of this decision, even though it is the right decision for our family and the right one for me. I've been busting my a-ss for the last 21 years to make sure everyone else was happy, that other people's needs were met, folding myself smaller and smaller to accommodate...and I'm done.
Bile rises in my throat the longer I watch them. I felt guilty for downloading the tracking app on my way here, telling myself that I was overreacting. He doesn't look guilty, no not at all. He looks pleased, sated, and happy. It strikes me in the center of my chest, I haven't seen him look like that in months. Their lips touch and I fight to swallow down the need to vomit. His hands caress her face tenderly and then roam down her slender body...I can't watch this anymore. I've seen what I needed to, but definitely not what I wanted to.
""Paige Garcia."" My name is called by the receptionist, a friendly woman in her 50's. I give her a thankful smile for pulling me back to the here and now. I stand, grabbing my purse and satchel, then waddle after her with my head held high.
She directs me with a graceful wave of her manicured hand into the large office of Mr. Lukas Vulakovich, Divorce Attorney. His reputation is stellar, and he came highly recommended. No one mentioned how devastatingly handsome he is, but in this situation its not relevant. My neglected lady bits think otherwise, but I'm ignoring them, just like I have for the past 5 months...since the last time I had sax.
He stands from behind his executive desk, causing my breath to hitch at the way his plaid dress shirt stretches at his shoulders and across his chest. Dark tailored pants do nothing to conceal the thick muscular thighs underneath. His skin is naturally tan like he spends time outdoors, and contrasts well with the sandy blonde of his longer hair on top and the gray of his buzzed sides. His beard is short, sprinkled with gray accentuating his angular jaw and square chin.
Mr. Vulakovich extends his right hand to me for a handshake. When his roughened palm touches mine...let's just say I'm glad to be wearing a panty liner. My boobs harden beneath my scrub top, but I'm wearing a supportive padded bra so he shouldn't be able to notice.
I look up at his face again when he doesn't release my hand fast enough. Bright blue eyes stare back at me surrounded by well-worn creases caused by his full lips stretched into a blinding smile of perfect white teeth. He is a man who laughs a lot, smiles readily...this is a man who still hasn't released my hand. I tug on it, hoping to break our connection, sever whatever it is zipping back and forth between us. I don't have time for any of that. I'm here for a reason and it isn't this.
""Have a seat, Mrs. Garcia, I apologize if you waited long."" He motions to one of the more comfortable chairs in front of his desk. Surprising me, he takes the chair next to me instead of returning behind his desk.
""Not long at all, and please call me Paige."" He nods, crossing a long leg over his other knee. He sits back in the chair, casual and confident.
""Lukas."" I nod. ""Now, tell me what's brought you into my office today.""
Placing my purse and satchel on the ground next to me, I shift to face him better, then clear my throat and sigh.
""I want a divorce."" His smile grows.
""I should think so, since I'm a divorce attorney."" I roll my eyes and stifle the urge to smile at his sarcasm. ""Why don't you tell me a little history.""
""Do you want the long or the short of it?""
""How about the long since you have such a beautiful voice."" I blush, I can't help it. I haven't been complimented in years. I'm not an ugly woman, but I am a 33-year-old mom of two, pregnant with a third and a loving and devoted wife. I guess that last part is about to change.
""My husband, Tomas Garcia, and I met in 7th grade. We've been inseparable since then. We married after our senior year of high school. He works for his family's construction company, and I am a Nurse Practitioner and instructor at the OSU Medical Center. We have two boys, 6 and 3, and I'm obviously 6 months pregnant with our third, though we don't know what the gender is.""
""And you want a divorce now?""
""Ideally, I'd still be blissfully pregnant trying to juggle life with two small children, large extended families, and a stressful yet rewarding job, while my husband and I continue to grow old together.""
""But..."" He prompts and I see his smile dim as he waits for me to get to the heart of the matter.
""This last pregnancy has been rough on my body. I started seeing a massage therapist to help. She and I became friends, and Tomas and I would double date with she and her husband. Tomas said he tweaked his back getting into his truck one morning, and I recommended that he see Moon for massage therapy.""
He holds up a hand with a smirk. ""Her name is Moon?""
""Yes, not the point of the story. Stay with me."" He nods for me to continue. ""Tomas took my recommendation to mean he should stick his tongue down her throat, and his manhood in her incense lined hippy vulva. I assure you; I never suggested such a thing.""
""Who would?"" He asks.
""He hasn't touched me since we found out I was pregnant. But for the last two months, he's certainly touched her. I saw them together, after hours, outside of where she works, in an intimate embrace. If he had come to me, talked to me, told me that his feelings had changed...I will tolerate a lot in life, but adultery and betrayal is not one of them. I want a divorce. I don't want anything from him, and I don't want to give him anything. He can have the kids every other weekend, six weeks over the summer, and we can alternate holidays. The baby does not stay with him overnight until they are weaned. We can set up a visitation arrangement around my bre@st feeding.""
""What about alimony and child support?"" I clench my fists at the thought of either, then flex them with a humorless laugh.
""It is my job that pays for our home, our vehicles, food, utilities, provides insurance and stability. I don't need either of those things from him, not that he has the means to pay them in the first place.""
Lukas sits up in his chair, a weird glint in his eyes, almost like he's angry. ""You said he works, what does he pay for?""
""His job doesn't pay as well as mine, so we generally use his paycheck as fun money. Trips, Christmas and birthday gifts, dinner out, things like that.""
""So, you would pay him alimony and child support?"" There is a challenge in his voice, and I rise to the occasion. Pissed and full of righteous indignation, I literally stand to point my finger at him as I unleash the kraken.
""I will not pay him a dime. Fu-ck that noise. I want that on the record. I was faithful, I preserved the sanctity of our marriage and the vows we took, I didn't break up our family. He did!"" Lukas chokes on a laugh and it only fuels my fire.
""There is no stenographer present, Paige, we aren't recording this meeting."" I huff and sit back down, my heart beating a mile a minute as I breathe deeply to calm down. ""You are right, though."" He says and my gaze snaps to him, ""You won't pay him a dime."" His conviction douses the flames, and my body finally relaxes into the chair.
""Thank you‚Äî""
""I am unable to represent you. However, I do know of an excellent divorce attorney who I know will represent you as soon as I call him."" I'm stunned silent for several long seconds as I process his refusal.
""Why can't you represent me? Do you know my husband? Have you slept with him too? Or Moon Dance?"" He chuckles but I don't find this funny.
""No. I haven't had the displeasure. It is a conflict of interest, Paige.""
Now I'm really confused. ""How so?"" He rests his elbows on his thighs and reaches across the space between us to grab my hand. I don't fight him, mostly because it feels good, comforting, but also because I don't know what is happening right now.
""I want to punch his face in for what he's done to you and shake his hand for being dumb enough to let you go. I want to take you to dinner.""
That was unexpected. Maybe he's crazy? Has anyone thought to have his head examined lately?
""Uh...You remember the part where I'm 6 months pregnant with my third and probably final child, I'm in the process of a divorce, and I'm 33 right?""
He chuckles, squeezing my hand, his eyes running over my face and down my body. ""I'm well aware of your circumstances. Just as I'm aware of your grit and sass and I can't wait to learn everything else about you.""
I blush again. I can feel my neck and chest heating just like my face under his gaze. ""You don't even know me.""
""I know enough to know I'm interested. Very interested. Call it a hunch."" That smile is back, and it does funny things to my belly. Non-baby and gas related things. I slouch in the chair and blow out a conflicted breath.
""I've been called a lot of things in my time, but never a hunch.""
Lukas Vulakovich 
I crossed a line. I crossed several and ask me if I care. Paige Garcia walked into my office a confident woman. When she spoke, I could see the strength in the set of her shoulders, could hear it in the tone of her voice.
I've never hit on a client, and certainly never turned one away because I wanted to take her out to dinner and peck her pouty lips and bang her until she's full of my release.
As a lawyer, and a father, and an ex-husband, I've learned to roll with the punches. And da-mn if Paige doesn't pack a wallop. Remembering her intake form, I'm a good 15 years older than her, which would normally bother me, leading me to think we weren't in the same place in life. But the thought of her walking out of this office and never seeing her again...
""Dinner? Tonight or tomorrow?"" I can sense her hesitation, she's in my office because she's still married, and I appreciate her concerns, I just don't think they justify losing out on spending time with her.
""I...uh...I."" She sits up in the chair, her dark espresso eyes pinning me in place. They complement her thick wavy hair of the same color. Her skin is flawless with a light golden hue, pouty lips, and a heart shaped face. And despite being dressed in scrubs, she is stunning, make-up free and glowing from her pregnancy.
My ex was a miserable incubator. She hated the idea of it and the reality of it more. Yet, she's the one who stopped birth control all three times. I put up with 9 months of bimboier attitude since it meant holding my babies at the end of it. My three are the light of my life and I can't imagine not having them. But I know what it's like to raise them on my own. To be let down by the person who pledged their life to you.
Maybe that's one of the reasons I'm so drawn to Paige. I have an idea of what she's going through. I can relate. And I have this powerful urge to make it easier on her. Remembering everything I went through...she doesn't need someone hitting on her, she needs a friend.
""Paige, I've been where you are."" I begin, then snort a laugh when she pointedly looks between me and her burgeoning belly. ""Ok, so not exactly where you are. I have three beautiful children and an ex-wife who really sh-it the bed on the whole fidelity thing. Can I take you out and be a friend? We can start there and see where it goes.""
She's quiet for a long time, her eyes narrowed as she assesses me. I have nothing to hide and everything to gain, so I sit back, my arms resting casually on the arms of the chair, while I spread my legs out to give my manhood room to breathe.
""My life......it doesn't even feel like my life anymore. It's a mess. A complete and total clusterfu-ck. Why would you want to jump into the melee? There are thousands of easier pussies to finagle your way into.""
""It's not about easy woman, it's about the right woman."" I tease and am instantly rewarded with a slight flush on her neck.
""Ok, Goldilocks."" I grin at her teasing. She can't help but join me as we stare at one another. She sighs, loud and long, ""So, say that I'm in the market for a new friend. You really want this job? It's going to involve a hormonally challenged pregnant woman who cycles through the stages of grief on an hourly basis while attempting to kick her husband out of the house and deal with two families that won't be happy about the circumstances and two small boys that won't understand why daddy isn't sleeping at home anymore. That's a lot. That's a lot for an episode of Jerry Springer.""
""Your husband doesn't know you are here?"" I ask once I parse through everything she said.
She shakes her head sadly, her lips tipping down into a frown. ""No, I caught them night before last. Called yesterday and made the appointment with you for today. I will be informing him once I secure an attorney."" She closes her eyes when they begin to shine with the threat of tears. When she opens them, a steely resolve has taken over and it makes me rock hard. ""There is no coming back from this. Under no circumstances will I tolerate or forget what he's done. Not only did he cheat on me, he cheated on me with someone I considered a friend, he lied to me for weeks. But the worst part, is that I allowed his behavior to lessen my self-worth. I allowed months of sexual distance to deteriorate my self-esteem. He saw what his actions and inactions did to me, and he let it continue. He isn't the man I married; he isn't the boy I fell in love with under the stars.""
The urge to punch this prick grows with every tortured word from her mouth. My resolve to be her friend and help her through this, pushes me into action. ""Well, then."" I slap my hands on my thighs and stand up, offering her a hand. ""Let's find you a lawyer.""
""Thank you, Lukas."" The way my name looks and sounds as its uttered from her lips has my manhood twitching my pants.
""You're welcome, Paige. And just for the record, I have no interest in sleeping with your soon to be ex-husband or any other member of your family."" When I wink, she throws her head back and laughs.
""Don't make promises you can't keep, Lukas. My Great-aunt Sara is quite the looker at 93.""
Paige 
""Why won't you tell me what's wrong?"" I close my eyes at the desperation in my mother's voice. I called to ask them to keep the kids for the night, even though they've had them all day. They shouldn't be subjected to what's going to happen when Tommy gets home. If he ever gets home, he's already an hour and a half late. ""Is there something wrong with the baby? Were you at the doctor's?""
""No, mom, the baby is healthy. I promise I will explain everything when I pick up the kids tomorrow. I need to talk with Tommy first.""
""Paige‚Äî""
""Mom, please. If it's a problem to keep the boys, I'll come get them.""
""No, you know they are never a bother, we love having them here. I'm just worried about you.""
""I know, just give me a little time.""
""Ok."" She concedes, grudgingly. ""I love you.""
""I love you too, mom. I'll call you in the morning."" I end the call and place my phone on the coffee table in front of me. Rubbing my belly, I think over my meeting with Lukas and subsequent phone call with his friend Owen, another divorce attorney who agreed to represent me.
My day certainly didn't go how I anticipated, honestly, I think it went better. Maybe. Lukas is unlike anyone I've ever met and certainly the complete opposite of my husband. Tommy is the only person I've ever pecked, had sax with, dated, etc. And up until I saw him with Moon, I'd have been happy if that was always the case.
I have excellent vision, so I've noticed attractive men over the years, but not once have I ever had the urge to know what their mouth tasted like, what their body felt like pressed against mine, if the sound of their laugh would always illicit goosebumps across my body. But Lukas did. He inspired all those thoughts and more. And that is terrifying.
I shake my head of thoughts of Lukas and focus on what Owen said. Based on the infidelity, he is confident that I shouldn't have to pay Tommy anything, and the other terms I outlined were reasonable and fairly standard. He asked directly if I wanted him to fu-ck Tommy over and conveniently forget the lube. After a shocked gasp and about 30 seconds of laughter, I sobered enough to decline his generous offer. He is the father of my children, and we will be in one another's life forever. Co-parenting will be difficult enough without adding anymore fuel to the dumpster fire that has become my life.
The sound of a car door shutting has my eyes snapping to the clock. My teeth grind when I see he's 2 hours later than usual. Gee, I wonder where he's been? Taking several deep breaths, I stand from the couch and lean against the doorway into the foyer.
He opens the door quietly, his head down as he pushes through, softly closing it behind him. When he glances up, his footsteps falter. ""Paige. What are you doing?""
""Just waiting for you."" I reply casually, one hand caressing my belly, whether to soothe me or the baby or both, I don't know.
He listens to the otherwise silent house, ""Where are the boys?""
""My parents."" He manhoods his head to the side in question, but I have one of my own. ""Where have you been?""
He drops his eyes to the ground while he toes his boots off. ""Work."" I lean closer to him, still maintaining a safe distance, and inhale.
""Ross giving you massages on the work sites now?"" He smells of cucumber, Moon's preferred lotion.
""I stopped by the massage place for a quick‚Äî""
I snort, very unladylike and stand up straight. ""I filed for divorce today."" I cut him off, not wanting to hear another lie, he's never been very good at them. It took me as long as it did to figure out what was going on because it never occurred to me that he could cheat, that he was capable of something so disrespectful and destructive.
""What?!"" He splutters, his eyes wide in shock and his jaw dropped. I've had enough standing, its hurting my back, so I turn to make my way over to the couch. He follows on my heels, mouth now gaping like a fish.
""I filed for divorce today. I need to know what address you'd like the papers sent to. Should be day after tomorrow.""
""Paige, what the heck?"" He runs his fingers through his black hair and plops into the recliner next to the couch. ""Why? Why would you do that?""
""Moon."" That one word, that one name, sucks every molecule of oxygen from the room. He rallies, though, or tries to, at least.
""You want a divorce because I'm getting massage therapy?""
""You've insulted me enough, Tommy, don't you think?"" I counter and wait him out. It doesn't take long, his shoulders slump and he falls back into the chair, eyes closed and a frown marring his face. I used to think he was handsome; he was my prince. Now, he's just the villain in my story.
""I have been...I love you, Paige, I've loved you since before I knew what the word meant. But Moon...she's breathed new life into me.""
I stare down at my belly and grit my teeth. ""You mean like the new life you fu-cked into me?""
""Paige."" He says my name like a scold, and I want to punch him in his face. Lukas hadn't even met Tommy and yet he knew right away what I have ignored for years; Tommy has a very punchable face. ""I love you both and I don't want to break up our family.""
""You should have thought about that before you gave Moon your beam.""
""This isn't the time for stupid jokes."" He snaps back.
""Oh, apparently it is, Tommy. Apparently the last 21 years has been nothing but a joke to you. The life we've built, our family, our kids."" I'm seething and for the sake of the baby I need to calm down. ""I don't understand why. You haven't touched me in months, why would you go elsewhere when I'm right here. I've been right here waiting for you, begging you..."" I swallow hard remembering the times I put on lingerie and lit candles only for him to brush me off. Or attempting to give him an impromptu blowjob where he pushed me aside and claimed a headache. How terrible I felt about myself. Hey limbo man, I can go pretty low it seems.
""I'm not...something about this pregnancy...I look at you, watch your belly grow with my child and it does nothing for me. I haven't been attracted to you since we found out.""
I ignore the gaping wound in my chest and push on, I can ugly cry later. ""But Moon's barren and infertile body does it for you?""
""It's not because she's unable to have children. She's...young and carefree and‚Äî""
""Not bogged down with a serious job, two kids already and one on the way, stretch marks, saggy boobs, you know, adult things. She's over 40 years old, Tommy, she isn't young.""
""She is to me, and she makes me feel young too.""
""No, she helps you forget you have responsibilities; she lets you live in a fantasy land where the choices you've made don't have consequences. Well, hate to burst your bubble, but they do now. You need to pack up your sh-it and get out. I'm done, I won't be second place, or a sister wife, or whatever you had in mind. Your children, the ones you helped create, aren't a weight around our necks pulling on the noose, they are a blessing and a gift. And I'll be screwed if I ever let you make them feel like they are anything else. Get. Gone.""
He sits up in the chair, eyes burning with anger. ""This is my house too, Paige, I'm not going anywhere.""
I laugh. Actually, full on belly laugh, with my head thrown back and everything. ""That's a good one, tell me another."" He's unimpressed, well, so am I. ""Who pays for this house? The utilities, the cars, the groceries, insurance?""
""We are partners‚Äî""
""I thought we were. I really did. You had me fooled for decades, Tommy. I'm not uprooting the kids from the only home they've ever known, and you can't afford to live here on your own. Now get your sh-it and get out.""
""Where am I supposed to go?""
""Go stay with Moon and her husband, maybe he'd be willing to share, since I'm not.""
Sensing I'm not backing down, Tommy stands up and stomps up the stairs into our bedroom. I sit on the couch, my hands shaking, my vision blurring. Minutes later, he descends the steps, stopping in the doorway to the living room.
""Paige...don't do this. Don't do something you're going to regret."" I stand up and look him in the eyes.
""I didn't do this, Tomas, you did. And it can never be undone or forgotten or fixed.""
""I want to be there when you tell the boys, when you tell them that you've sent their daddy away."" I nod, not trusting myself to speak for several long seconds, knowing that telling my boys will be the hardest thing I've ever done.
He shifts from foot to foot, waiting for me to give in, I'm sure, but I know this is the right thing to do. Finally, he grabs his bag and shuffles to the front door. With his hand on the doorknob, I say his name. He looks at me over his shoulder with puppy dog eyes and a frown.
""You're blind, if you can't see my hair, nails and complexion have never looked better."" It is petty, I know. But it's the truth. And it makes me feel marginally better. He doesn't say anything, just shakes his head and walks out. I stand in the foyer for I don't know how long, listening to him start his car, drive away, and take 20 years of my life with him.",1,1739392218.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False
1io0wae,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1io0wae/triangulation_and_conflict_avoidance_in_my/,Triangulation and Conflict Avoidance in My Relationship with My Ex,"Recently I [asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalabuse/comments/1ii1pfu/what_is_happening/) people in another subreddit what had happened in my relationship with the woman who most recently became my ex.

I think I have found two significant pieces of the puzzle: [Triangulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9I6j8-JSHps) and conflict avoidance. (The link will take you to a Dr. Ana video that has given me **a lot** of insight into what my ex was doing.)

If my ex had a problem with something I had done, instead of talking to me about it, she‚Äôd tell one of her friends. If I felt bad about something I thought I had gotten wrong, I‚Äôd tell her I felt bad, she‚Äôd tell me that she understood where I was coming from and had no reason to be sorry, and then she‚Äôd turn around and get one of her friends to reassure her that she had been wronged. After doing this for over six years, she started pulling away from me in phases, and at one point she explained it by saying, ‚ÄúAll my friends have been telling me . . . .‚Äù The sharing was not always concerned with what I had (allegedly) done wrong; she also shared a lot of personal info with at least one of my friends, and that never stopped no matter how many times I told her that she was hurting me. (If anyone can tell me how that might figure into the triangulation or the abuse, I‚Äôd be grateful.)

But the triangulation didn‚Äôt end there. One of her friends sent me a harassing, threatening email in which they (the friend) parroted what my ex had said, becoming a ‚Äúrescuer‚Äù in the [Karpman drama triangle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle). At one point, after I had been using analogies to explain how some of her actions had affected me, she had told me that I wasn‚Äôt allowed to compare her actions to an abusive person‚Äôs behavior. She later relented, correctly noting that she had not set a proper boundary, and she consented to hearing me make such comparisons again. In a subsequent real-time situation I compared her to an abusive person who resorts to DARVO. She apologized and seemed to see where I was coming from, but shortly after that she resorted scorched earth tactics, sending me an email in which she attacked me and insisted that all future communication be done through an intermediary because if I made any more abuse comparisons she would commit suicide. Mind you, she had never told me that the old rule was back in place or asked me to stop before imposing the consequence. Even though I couldn‚Äôt think of any reason why she had to go from 0 to 80 like that, I tolerated the arrangement. In hindsight, it looks like that was another way to triangulate. After all, she was guaranteeing that one of her friends would be present for a conversation that didn‚Äôt concern her (the friend). I recently blocked email from both her and the intermediary, cutting off that particular avenue.

Earlier in our relationship, when I lay down next to her in bed one night while we were having an important conversation, she put the cat between us. I found it really hurtful because I could usually take it for granted that she would give me physical affection. We had been physically close since our first date; she had taken me by the hand right after we met up, and once we got to the coffee shop, she sat down with her body pressed against mine. When I told her how the incident with the cat made me feel, she told me she did it because she anticipated that I would not be supportive of her.

I know (some of) what my ex has been holding against me because she started pulling down avalanches of accusations on me, and I learned a lot from the harassing, threatening email. She and the friend who has been harassing me characterized me as abusive and manipulative. Mind you, after the first wave of accusations, she told me she would be willing to be my wingwoman if I ever wanted to ask out another woman. (You wouldn‚Äôt find me recommending that someone date her!) She also had no qualms about lying prone in bed for weeks while she recovered from surgery. That was around the time I canceled a surgery appointment because after her recent erratic behavior I didn‚Äôt want to risk being partially sedated or having limited mobility around her.

Does anyone happen to know of resources about abusers‚Äô triangulation or conflict avoidance? Apart from the link above I haven‚Äôt found much relevant information on these topics.",1,1739392197.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
1io0vwd,https://www.reddit.com/r/TeachersInTransition/comments/1io0vwd/just_quit_my_band_directing_job/,Just quit my Band Directing Job,"Trigger Warning: discussion of mental health and Unaliving thoughts

Hey Guys, I've been struggling this week so I think it'll be good to get my story off my chest.

Well as the title suggests, I just quit my Band Directing job last week.  I worked at a private Conservative Christian school.  This was my first year there, year 4 overall.  I really enjoyed this school and the people and the kids (for the most part...) but all this year I couldn't shake the anxiety and overwhelming feeling of stress.  I had a pretty toxic work environment at my last job (suburban/rural public school, lower SES) Admin always on my ass about what I was doing wrong (despite very favorable evaluation scores from non-admin evaluations) not very supportive or helpful in learning the practical things of running a program (specifically what paperwork was expected of me, usually I was informed last minute of those things) and just generally we weren't aligned on we wanted out of the band program (the whole district's mindset was very competition based, where I am much more focused on making music fun and the kids becoming better musicians, not to say that competition can't work with that but you get where I'm coming from.)  Toward the end of my time there, I brought the band to a local competition, and let's just say,  we received pretty low scores.  I was pretty ashamed and upset at the time despite the fact that I don't really agree with competition being the end all be all of what makes a successful band program. My admin came down pretty hard and wanted me to come up with a whole formal improvement plan. I just knew that I couldn't go through with all of that and keep my sanity.  So I this is why I left and took the job at my most recent school.

I had some reservations as I don't really vibe with just how conservative the school was, but growing up and living in the South, I figured it was something I could deal with if it meant a better work environment.  (no shade on them, just not my cup of tea) And the expectations were much more aligned at the new school.  They didn't care if we did any competitions, no marching band (only pep band at home games) and I worked closely with a friend of mine from college as the other director, who had transitioned part-time this year.  And on top of all that, my commute was in half from before and much more amenities by work (coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, etc.)  So for all intents and purposes, it should have been a much better job.

Over Christmas break, I had basically decided enough was enough and that I would finish out the year and look for jobs outside of teaching.  Well, leading up to and including the first week back was really difficult for me and my mental health (lots of anxiety and stress and thoughts of unaliving myself) and so I had decided that I should just quit on the spot.  A close friend of mine had encouraged me to seek more professional help (I had been seeing a counselor for the anxiety and stress, but it didn't help much) so long story short, I ended up in the emergency room, and then the behavioral health unit of my local hospital.  I was ""involuntarily committed"" but I, with the help of my wife, sought out the treatment.  I was there for about 4 days and then released, the following Monday I told my boss what happened and that I was considering resigning.  Since it was my first year there and no FMLA, I didn't really have any options for leave. I took a couple of weeks to really think it through and eventually told them I was resigning. All in all, the whole situation has been about a month now. I have now started medication and started seeing a new counselor.

I have applied to so many jobs now, had a few promising leads on some state jobs and I had an interview with my local university as a Financial Aid Counselor, should hear back soon on that.  I also have a job at a new coffee shop lined up for the end of the month.  So obviously, I'm pretty stressed about finding a new job, but we have a good amount of savings, and very supportive family and friends.  So I think it'll all be ok.

I kind of just felt like it was good to write this out.   I'm open to anyone's thoughts or whatever.  Thanks for reading!",12,1739392169.0,TeachersInTransition,4,0.93,False

After we get done raiding he hops off and I say thank you. I ask for advice on weight and he gets on and immediately asks what I need. He made me excavator armor, gave me meds, ammo, etc. After all of that he asks if I need weapon mods and I thought he meant something like a barrel or sight. I was over the moon excited as I use what weapons I find. 

He came over and proceeded to drop me atleast 10 different legendary mods. Then he proceeded to ask if I had any specific ones I wanted. When I asked him if he needed anything in return all he said was he wanted canned coffee.

1|by everting their body and then wriggling into their target's body - digesting the unnecessary internal organs and linking their nerves and circulatory system into the leftover husk to walk it around and sustain it.
2|through immersion in a pod they've hidden in their base of operations, which breaks their body down into goo and rebuilds it into the new form.
3|by smearing on a coat of nanotechological ""clay"" that mimics the colours, textures, and temperature of human tissues.
4|by putting their target into a coma then attuning to the target's neuro-electrical self-image - if their target ever wakes up or dies, the reptilian loses their form.
5|by metamorphosing like a caterpillar, using their skin as a chrysalis. If they lose their shed skin, they lose their ability to shapeshift.
6|by rotating parts of their body through higher spatial dimensions until they approximate the desired form - as this can put their insides on their outside, their shapeshifted forms are often surprisingly fragile.

4|to discover the fate of an infiltration force that was sent to the planet a century ago.

He‚Äôd been in a swift decline from cancer.

I still had over 5 hours to go on the flight. I couldn‚Äôt control my emotions at all and was sitting next to a woman with bronchitis who coughed in my ear the entire flight. I was surrounded by trolleys with clinking wine bottles and there was no prospect of moving somewhere more private as it was a full flight. It would have been so easy to ask the cabin crew for a drink to numb out the pain.

I didn‚Äôt. I put my blanket over my head and just rode the tidal wave of emotion. I knew that drinking wouldn‚Äôt make anything better. I had a right to feel incredibly sad and feeling my emotions was the right thing to do. Same goes for 2 days later when I went to see my Dad at the mortuary - I said goodbye, told him I was sorry and I loved him, then sat with my feelings over a chocolatey coffee in the hospital cafe.

I‚Äôm still in the UK supporting my Mum, handling funeral arrangements involving my dysfunctional family and watching my brother deal with this by drinking a little too much. I‚Äôm 767 days sober (2 years, 1 month, 5 days) and if I can get through this without booze, I can do anything. If I can do this, so can you. I know my Dad would be so proud of me.

I own a beauty salon in a mall near by, since before I got married. One day my husband and I were just sitting there in the beauty salon talking and saw my SIL and her family walking by. We were surprised since they almost never come to this particular Mall, we approached to say hello and they explained the needed to kill time waiting for husband/father to finish a meeting and go home. 

They were complaining that everything in this Mall is way too expensive, even the cafeterias and they were tired of walking around. I invited them to come in the beauty salon, take a seat and have some complementary coffee. 

Once inside they starting asking about services and prices, I explained and invited them to the complementary manicures. I managed to get them seated and some nail techs to take care of them. I again explained what the complementary service consisted of and left to tend to other costumers. My husband went to do some grocery shopping and everything seemed fine.

A moment later the nail techs approach me and tell me SIL and daughters are asking to get full set nails and some other and on services. This services are about 4 o 5 times more expensive that the complementary manicures I offered. I was hands full with another client and unable to go over so I asked the nail techs to explain that the extra cost would be charged applying a friends and family discount but it would not be free.

A couple hours later I was done with my client and saw SIL and daughters sitting on the waiting room having tea, I approached and asked how was everything and they seemed pleased. 

Husband/father arrived shortly after and they came up to me to sort goodbye, once again I asked how everything went and they seemed happy. So I handed them the bill and explained I had reduced the cost of the complementary service I offered and applied an extra 30% off for the friends an family discount. The due amount was around $200. 

My SIL husband just paid and they left. 

Minutes later MIL is blowing up my husbands phone saying I am crazy for inviting them in and then charging them $200. FIL Is livid saying SIL can't afford something like that and that it is my business I should just get them free nails because they are family and I am better off financially.

The next day more family members get involved and sayin ITAH because who would charge a family member for nails. Specially knowing they struggle financially.

4. Making fruit and nuts my snacking choices. Bananas, strawberries, blueberries, almonds, walnuts and peanuts have been my favorites lately.

Any other suggestions? I‚Äôm pretty underweight and want to get back to a normal weight, to the point people have been concerned. But I also don‚Äôt want to make a habit of eating like fast food everyday just to gain weight fast.

I attributed this to a couple nights of drinking a lot of coffee (wife had bought me a little kuerig for my streaming setup) a night from maybe 1 or 2 a month to 2 or 3 a night (I live on schedule where I sleep from 6am to 2pm. It's just my bodies natural rhythm.) Along with the coffee, I had a few nights where I just wanted to relax and indulged in some thc gummies, corona, and a little flower smoking. A night or two I would notice a spike when sleeping, but it would be gone when I woke.
Around this same time (2nd week of January this year), I fell in the shower and bent my neck pretty good, bit didn't seem to notice any increase until I started getting some of the nasty bigs floating around. I  had the flu one week, got better, and then few days later caught the norovirus. Once that cleared up, I started noticing the rining getting louder (again, still drinking coffee and thc) and attributed it to that until I started coughing and feeling like I had a cold. Turns out, it was bronchitis and developed into an inner ear infection on my left side. So, tinnitus flair could have been a warning sign of getting sick.  Still on antibiotics, I went to the chiropractor today to finally get realigned from my fall in the shower, and for the first time in a while, I had nearly 2 hours of silence in my ears. Such a feeling!

Hi

I recently signed a 10-year lease for a coffee shop in a commercial building. At the time of signing, there was no mention of flood zone concerns. However, my SBA lender has informed me that we need flood insurance to close the loan because the building is considered to be in a flood zone.

I spoke with the landlord, who claims that while one side of the building is in a flood zone, the side that our store located is not, as it is situated on higher ground. Despite this, the SBA lender is basing their assessment on FEMA reports, which classify the building as being in a flood zone.

Given that we were not made aware of this issue when signing the lease, I'm wondering if it‚Äôs reasonable to ask the landlord to either cover the cost of flood insurance or provide a discount equivalent to that cost. The landlord insists that since our store is not in a flood zone, we should not be required to have flood insurance.

If anyone has experience with commercial property rentals and can offer guidance on how to approach this issue with the landlord, I would greatly appreciate it.

Thank you!
