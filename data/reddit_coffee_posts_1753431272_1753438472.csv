I currently have a cheap burr grinder that I bought a few years ago - a delonghi kg79. I've decided it's time to step up my game and buy a decent grinder.

I mainly make a v60 or a aeropress using light roast single origin beans (normally bought from square mile coffee). I'm looking to spend about ¬£250 at the absolute max. I was considering the opus until I saw all the complaints about retention.

Any recommendations would be appreciated! 

Also, not overly bothered by espresso performance as I'm not looking to move into home espresso anytime soon. ",1,1753438414.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

## Key Features Analysis

The best engraved coffee mugs stand out due to ‚Å§a combination of factors,‚Å¢ including ‚Äåthe material, the engraving quality, ‚Å¢the available customization‚Äå options, and the overall design aesthetic.

**material Quality:** Premium mugs are crafted from durable materials like stoneware, porcelain, or high-grade stainless steel. These ‚Å£materials not only‚Å§ offer‚Äã superior ‚Å£heat‚Äã retention but also provide a smooth, receptive ‚Å£surface for engraving. Stoneware is known for its rustic charm and durability, while porcelain offers a more refined and elegant look. Stainless‚Å¢ steel mugs are ‚Å§incredibly robust and retain‚Äç heat exceptionally‚Å¢ well, making them ideal for outdoor‚Å§ use.

The quality ‚Å£of the material directly‚Äå impacts the longevity and aesthetic appeal of the mug. Cheaply made ‚Å§mugs can be‚Å¢ prone to chipping, cracking, or staining, which detracts from the engraved‚Å¢ design. ‚Å§Look for‚Äã mugs with thick walls and a substantial weight ‚Äåto ‚Äãensure durability.**Engraving Precision and Depth:** The precision and depth of the engraving‚Å£ are‚Å§ crucial for creating a lasting and visually appealing design. laser engraving is the preferred method, as it allows for intricate detailing ‚Äãand‚Å¢ precise execution. Deep ‚Å§engraving ensures that the design will not fade, peel, or wear away over time, even with frequent use and‚Å§ washing.

Shallow‚Å£ or uneven‚Äå engraving‚Äç can result‚Å§ in a blurry or ‚Å£indistinct design that lacks visual ‚Å£impact. Look for mugs that boast high-resolution laser engraving or sandblasting for a crisp,clean,and permanent finish. Pay‚Äå close attention to the ‚Äåline quality‚Å¢ and the‚Äç overall clarity of the engraved details.

**Customization ‚ÄåOptions:** ‚ÄåThe ‚Å£ability to personalize the mug is‚Å¢ at the ‚Å§heart of its appeal as a unique gift. The‚Äç best engraved coffee‚Å£ mugs offer‚Äã a wide range of ‚Å§customization options, including the ability to‚Å¢ add names, dates, quotes, monograms, logos, or even custom artwork. Some‚Äã vendors provide online‚Äã design tools that allow you to preview the engraved design before placing your order, ensuring that you are fully satisfied with the final‚Å§ result.

Flexible customization‚Å£ options empower ‚Å¢you to create a truly one-of-a-kind gift that reflects the recipient's‚Å£ personality and interests. Consider the range of ‚Äãfonts, design templates, and graphic elements available when ‚Äåchoosing an engraved mug.

**Design aesthetic and Ergonomics:** Beyond‚Äå the ‚Äãengraved design, the overall aesthetic and ergonomic design of the mug play a ‚Å¢meaningful role in ‚Å£its appeal. Look for mugs ‚Äçwith a comfortable handle that fits well in your hand and a wide base for stability. The shape ‚Å¢and size ‚Å§of the mug should be conducive to enjoying your favorite hot beverages.

The design aesthetic should complement the engraved design and enhance the overall visual appeal. Consider the ‚Äåcolor, finish, and shape‚Äã of the mug ‚Äåwhen‚Äç selecting an option ‚Äçthat aligns with‚Å§ your personal style or‚Äå the recipient's preferences.

I am wondering if i am simply being difficult, or if i am right here.

So  i work in logistics in a warehouse, in this warehouse we have 3 departments.
2 on the warehouse floor, and 1 in the upstairs office.

I have a team of 5 people, more often then not we are only with 4, or even 3. And the last half of my workday i am usually alone.

The other team is with +/-10 people
And customer service around 20 people.

We have a shared breakroom, and a cleaning schedule with everyone's name on it.

Every week the people responsible for cleaning the breakroom and putting dishes in the dishwasher are rotated.

I literally never use the breakroom, i sit outside.
I maybe go in there 1 time a day or not at all, i take a cup of coffee from the coffee machine and i leave, paper cup btw, so no dishes.

We are all adults here, and in my opinion the people who use dishes can put them in the dishwasher themselves
But instead they just put it on the counter and expect someone else to clean it for them.

Since i literally never have breaks in there and never use any dishes i crossed my name of the cleaning list.

I did this because i literally never use any dishes from here, and i never have my breaks in the breakroom.

But today a coworker asked me why i crossed my name of, and i explained, but he insisted he feels like we should all be responsible for that, even if we don't use it.
I politely disagreed.

What do you think?
Should i just clean other people's mess in a room that i literally never use?
Or am i right here by refusing to clean the mess of other adults?

‚ÄúAgain?‚Äù he replied, sipping his coffee.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs pretty,‚Äù¬† She smiled.¬† Fresh snow always reminded her of her childhood.¬† Snow angels, snowmen, sledding down Schuman‚Äôs hill...¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs awful.‚Äù¬† Unfortunately, he didn‚Äôt feel the same.¬† Sure, the snow looked great in photos during that first moment after the sun rose, with everything looking somehow unreal, like they were living in some nativity scene made out of miniature models.¬† Minutes later, however, he‚Äôd have to strap on his winter gear and sludge through the wet muck to start shoveling the driveway, scraping the car, cleaning the mess.¬† A snowy night may look pretty, but it meant hours of extra back-breaking labor just to get to work on time.¬†

He hated every minute of it, and had been counting down the minutes to spring since the first crisp day in October.¬†

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not so bad,‚Äù she said, sitting down at the table with him and smiling gently.¬† She knew he hated it.¬† Having grown up in the south, he didn‚Äôt have the same warm winter memories of snuggling in front of the fire, watching the snow come down.¬†

‚ÄúI want a divorce,‚Äù he said, calmly.¬† His words hit her like a punch in the stomach.¬† She was paralyzed for a moment, unable to speak, the hurt growing inside her stomach quickly until she feared she might vomit.

She stood up, but her legs couldn‚Äôt support her.¬† She sat back down.¬†

‚ÄúBut...‚Äù¬† She had a million questions, a thousand things to say, a hundred thoughts exploding through her head, but she could only manage this one single word.¬†

He gulped.¬† He hadn‚Äôt planned on saying it this way.¬† Hell, he hadn‚Äôt been sure he wanted to say it at all, but when he looked outside and saw the snow coming down, really falling, he just couldn‚Äôt hold it in any longer.¬†

When he looked outside, he didn‚Äôt see a winter wonderland, he saw a miserable future.¬† He saw years of shoveling, of scraping, of snow tires and soggy boots.¬† And he just couldn‚Äôt stand it.

‚ÄúI just can‚Äôt take it anymore...‚Äù he whispered, afraid that if he let his voice go any louder, he might scream.¬†

She stared at him, dumbstruck.¬† ‚ÄúWhat have I done?‚Äù

It killed him to think that she might blame herself, when this couldn‚Äôt be further from the truth.¬† He still loved her, but North Dakota had never been part of the plan.¬† When they had met in college, at the University of Texas, he had fallen head over heels in love almost immediately.¬† She was kind and sweet and beautiful.¬† They were married within a year.¬†

He still loved her, still felt lucky whenever she looked at him or held his hand, but sometimes love just wasn‚Äôt enough.¬† She wanted to be close to home, here, in North Dakota.¬† She loved the big sky, the rural community, the closeness to nature.¬† But he just loved her.¬†

He knew that if he asked her, she would leave and go with him back to Texas, or to California, or anywhere else, really, where the weather wasn‚Äôt fully designed to kill everything in a sea of white nothingness every year.¬† She would go, sure, but she wouldn‚Äôt be happy, and he wouldn‚Äôt be able to live with himself knowing she was miserable just for him.¬†

But at the same time, he couldn‚Äôt be miserable just for her.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôve met someone else,‚Äù he lied, giving her a reason to hate him.¬† It would make things easier.¬† He would leave, and find a new life more suited to his needs.¬† She would stay and find someone who enjoyed sipping hot cocoa at the ski lodge with her.¬† He would have given anything to be that man, but he just wasn‚Äôt.¬†

Outside, she was quiet and still.¬† Inside, she was a raging torment of emotion.¬† The anger and sadness boiled over until tears poured from her eyes and her lips quivered like a whistling tea pot, signaling that she was ready to explode.¬† She kept her control.

‚ÄúWho?‚Äù She asked, as calmly as humanly possible.¬†

He hadn‚Äôt thought this through, but slowly began to pile lies on top of lies.¬† He had reconnected with an old friend through facebook, he explained.¬† He would be going back to Texas to start a new life without her.¬†

She cried quietly.¬† She knew he wasn‚Äôt a fan of the long winters.¬† But love conquered all, didn‚Äôt it?¬† As he talked, explaining his imaginary transgressions, she felt like he was cutting her open with a knife, ripping her apart.

They talked for hours as the snow fell from the sky, rising quickly.¬† Within the first hour, it was impossible to see where the edge of the property ended and the street began.¬† After two hours, the tires of the car were completed hidden.¬† By lunch time, the mailbox was completely buried, with just the small red flag sticking out from the white blanket covering the earth.¬†

By five o‚Äôclock, there was nothing left to say.

‚ÄúI think I should go,‚Äù he said, but he hadn‚Äôt been paying attention to the weather outside.¬†

When he opened the door, he was faced with a wall of snow.¬† Leaving was certainly impossible.¬† But he couldn‚Äôt stay.¬† He strapped on his boots and grabbed his coat and got to work.¬† After a few hours, he hadn‚Äôt even reached the car and came inside begrudgingly to warm up.¬†

She couldn‚Äôt stand to be near him anymore.¬† She suited up and went outside to look at the glorious winter, avoiding him.¬† When she saw how hard he was working to leave, and the impossible task he had given himself, she couldn‚Äôt help herself.¬†

She turned back to look at him and laughed, while he stood in the doorway, rubbing his red hands together and crying softly to himself.",2,1753437264.0,Onethousandwords,0,1.0,False

In the front zipped pocket I stashed my keys, AirPods and mirror since that section has a bit more built‚Äëin organization.

It carries comfortably though that's no surprise with such a minimal load out. I might share some photos later to show how it sits on the body. Overall a win (and a replacement for my Aer Day Sling 3 which just didn't suit me)",3,1753437140.0,ManyBaggers,0,1.0,False

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

# 5 Micron Filter 2025: Best Options, Expert Buying Guide

A 5 micron filter is a crucial component in various filtration systems, from household water purification to industrial applications. It‚Äôs designed to remove particles larger than 5 microns, including sediment, rust, and certain microorganisms, leading to cleaner and safer water or fluids. Choosing the right 5 micron filter can considerably impact the efficiency and longevity of your filtration system, as well as the quality of the filtered substance. The market offers a wide array of options, each wiht its own strengths and weaknesses. This guide will help you navigate the selection process and identify the best 5 micron filter for your specific needs in 2025.

[[Explore Top Rated 5 micron filter on Amazon.]](https://news.perfectshome.com/clearance-inventory/?kw=5 micron filter)

## Key Features Analysis

The efficiency and effectiveness of a 5 micron filter depend on a variety of factors, including its construction materials, filtration media, flow rate, and overall design. Understanding these key features is essential for making an informed purchasing decision.

**Filtration Media:** The filtration media is at the heart of any filter, and different materials offer varying levels of performance and durability.

Polypropylene is a common and cost-effective material used in many 5 micron filters. It's known for its resistance to chemicals and bacteria, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. However, polypropylene filters may not be as effective at removing certain contaminants as other materials. Spun-bonded polypropylene filters can be more resistant to clogging and provide good initial filtration. Melt-blown polypropylene filters,on the other hand,tend to provide tighter filtration and increased particle removal.**Flow Rate:** The flow rate indicates how much fluid can pass through the filter in a given time,typically measured in gallons per minute (GPM).

A higher flow rate is desirable for applications requiring a large volume of filtered fluid, such as whole-house water filtration. However, increasing the flow rate can sometimes compromise filtration efficiency. The optimal flow rate depends on the specific filter design and the intended application. It‚Äôs crucial to choose a filter with a flow rate that meets your needs without sacrificing filtration quality. Look for filters providing a specific flow rate at a particular pressure (PSI) to properly evaluate flow characteristics.

**Housing Material:** The filter housing is the container that holds the filtration media. The material of the housing impacts durability, chemical resistance, and overall lifespan.

Common housing materials include polypropylene, polyethylene, and stainless steel. Polypropylene housings are lightweight and cost-effective but may not be suitable for high-pressure or high-temperature applications. Stainless steel housings offer superior durability and chemical resistance, making them ideal for demanding industrial environments. Choosing the right housing material is important for ensuring the longevity and safety of your filtration system.

**micron Rating:** The micron rating determines the smallest particle size that the filter can effectively remove, expressed in microns (¬µm).

A 5 micron filter is designed to trap particles larger than 5 ¬µm, such as sand, silt, rust, and some bacteria. It's important to note that the micron rating is not an absolute guarantee of complete removal. Some particles smaller than 5 ¬µm may still pass through the filter, especially at higher flow rates. However, it provides a good indication of the filter's overall filtration performance. Absolute-rated filters have a tighter pore size with better particle removal, while nominal-rated filters have a wider pore size range and are more common.

## Core Benefits

A 5 micron filter offers several key benefits, contributing to improved water quality, prolonged equipment lifespan, and enhanced system performance. These advantages make them valuable in various residential, commercial, and industrial settings.

**Improved Water Quality:** A 5 micron filter effectively removes sediment, rust, and other particulate matter from water, leading to clearer, cleaner, and better-tasting water. This is particularly important for drinking water applications, as it reduces the risk of consuming harmful contaminants. Moreover, cleaner water can improve the performance and lifespan of appliances such as water heaters and washing machines.**Extended Equipment Lifespan:** By removing abrasive particles, a 5 micron filter protects downstream equipment from wear and tear, prolonging its lifespan. This is particularly relevant in industrial applications where sensitive machinery is used. Removing sediment and debris prevents clogging and damage of pumps, nozzles, and other critical components.

**Reduced Maintenance costs:** Using a 5 micron filter minimizes the need for frequent cleaning and maintenance of filtration systems and downstream equipment. Clogging and scaling are considerably reduced, and systems work more efficiently for longer periods. This reduction in downtime and maintenance translates into significant cost savings over time.**Enhanced System Performance:** Cleaner fluids allow systems to operate at peak performance. For instance, in hydroponics, cleaner nutrient solutions support healthier plant growth. In industrial cooling systems, cleaner water provides more effective heat transfer.This increased efficiency leads to better overall results and process optimization.

## FAQs Section

**How often should I replace my 5 micron filter?**
The lifespan of a 5 micron filter depends on the quality of the incoming water or fluid and the filter's capacity. Generally, filters should be replaced every 3-6 months in residential applications or when you notice a significant drop in water pressure. In industrial settings, monitor pressure differential and replace the filter when the recommended differential is reached.

**Can a 5 micron filter remove bacteria and viruses?**
A 5 micron filter can remove some larger bacteria but is not effective at removing viruses or dissolved contaminants. For complete bacteria and virus removal,you would typically need a finer filter such as an ultrafiltration membrane,reverse osmosis system or a UV sterilizer along with the 5 micron pre-filter.

**Are all 5 micron filters the same size?**
No, 5 micron filters come in various sizes to fit different filter housings. Common sizes include 10-inch, 20-inch, and slimline cartridges. It's crucial to choose a filter size that is compatible with your existing filter housing. Review your filter housing documentation to ensure proper sized filter is used for optimal performance.

We don't know if this is even possible. From Yellow's accounting he was in his room sleeping until security called him around 7 and let him know she was missing. We don't know if there are other witness statements and key card entry info to alibi Yellow.

So, they are in the disco, top of the ship, close to 6 am.

And then what?

He is supposedly seen on the deck at 6 alone.

That's literally just a few minutes to supposedly do anything at all. It takes time for ingested drugs to have effects, including ingestion. Are we trying to say she chugged a coffee or coke?

Nobody is even disembarking the ship until well after 7 or 8.

So what happened in the disco?

Did someone else take her?

How did they sneak her off the ship?

Did they hide her somewhere?

How?? There's lots of people on a ship. Were they just dragging her around? Were they dragging some kind of large container around?

How would nobody have reported on it after all this time? 250k? Somebody on that cruise would squeal.

Do they think someone killed her? Who the hell risks killing a stranger who is with her family on a cruise ship? Who would help anyone else dispose of a body?

Why couldn't the eyewitness timelines be verified? Was it because they just made it all up to try and blame Yellow?

It doesn't make any reasonable sense to me.

If anyone has good answers, please post any abduction scenarios that could actually happen, starting on the very top of the ship in the disco.

I wouldn't like to paint her as a bad person because she's not so I'll list her pros and cons.

J is pure hearted, smart, very loving and attached me, she loves me A LOT, has ambitions, family oriented, outgoing and wants to spend time with me every possible second, she has a big heart also.

J is also very possessive, meaning that I have absolutely not one single female friend from my past because she didn't like any of them, she has very low self esteem when it comes to the relationship and I understand that this could be due to the fact that she got cheated on in her last relationship and she realized this after they broke up (I am her 2nd relationship).

She is a cry baby, she cries at every single argument and if the argument goes sideways then she might get a panic attack and that's when I always drop everything and snuggle her to calm her down.

She gives a little girl energy, everything for her is roses and rainbows it feels like she's in a fairytale. 

Prior to this relationship, I have hooked up with one woman multiple times and before that I was in a 10 months relationship that ended due to the fact that my gf back then was constantly lying and cheating on me.

For the past year I have been getting these urges to see another women for the sake of getting to know how other women are like or maybe even for sex (I have never acted on my urges and I don't want to do such a thing to J).

I get these urges every month or 2 weeks and then I distract myself and they're just gone for some time until I see someone attractive, I thought a lot about it I have considered some points that I'd like to share with you and I'd really appreciate your opinion on the matter as this is something I can't discuss with J, knowing her if I tell her that I'm getting very attracted to other women then this might break her + she has a very low self-esteem when it comes to this relationship. 

1. The little girl energy is always there and I would really appreciate a young women energy also sometimes.

2. The sex is amazing (once a week or two weeks which is not that much) but it feels like I'm having it with a teenager, there is no sexiness in it and it has to always start in the same exact way, kisses in bed.

3. The fact that the only women I am talking to is the women in my family/hers or her friends is a bit bothering me, if I have a work relationship with a female colleague then it is a no for her, meaning if I have time at work I can't even drink a coffee with a female colleague to kill time.

4. I feel like I'm missing out, is it because I've only touched 3 women in my life? I really don't know it could also be because I don't know how other women are like and it is like a mysterious territory for me, I mean maybe it is not about sex but just having a casual female friend? Does having a casual female friend count as cheating or inappropriate? 

I would really like to work on what I already have as I see J as a wife material and I do trust her but at the same time I can't really discuss any of this with her because I'll definitely get the ""I'm not good enough for you, I'm a shit person, you don't love me anymore, you don't want me anymore"" due to her self-esteem.

Is what I'm feeling something common? am I just a shitty person? I am here asking for your advice/guidance. 

TL;DR: I have been getting these urges to see other women outside of my relationship and I am not sure why but I have never acted on these urges and I am not planning on doing that.",0,1753434875.0,relationships,6,0.3,False

Sadly, there have been times when I've ""fallen off the wagon"" so to say.  I know my largest hurdle has been my perfecting my diet.

I've had some injuries over the past 18 months.  None due to training. I've never been injured from weight training.  My current measured BF is at 23%!  I'd like that down to a reasonable 17-18%.  I think it a reachable goal.

Again, my diet has never been dialed in. This, I feel and know, has kept me from feeling and looking my best.  
  
Example day:   
I wake at 5, have a coffee and walk to the fitness centre starting my training around 6am.  Done by 7 and home by 7:15 to have my first meal.

Meal 1:  50gr oats with 30gr of protein powder mixed with water.  
Meal 2:  Spelt roll with sliced turkey or salmon.  Maybe half an apple and some cucumber.  
Meal 3:  Loads of veg and meat of some type (no fan of pork).  
Meal 4:  Protein shake and some apple.  
Meal 5:  Steak with more veg and perhaps a spot of rice or noodles.  
Meal 6:  Casein shake with water around 8pm.  
  
I'm about to start training again, so I'll start around 1900-2000 cal per day.  If things go well, I'll increase that to around 2600-2700. slowly over time.  
  
I keep my macros at P30%, C40%, F30% and use FitnessPal to keep track.  
  
What could I improve / adjust to make the most gains possible and reduce some fat?  I'm an ""upper-middle-aged-lad""  I don't need to do massive bulking and cutting phases.  Just increase muscle whilst losing fat to stay fit into my older years.  
  
I'm open to all opinions and advice.

We are a family of two, both in our late 40s. Not terribly keen on nightlife and the big city buzz (we currently live in a small town south of London). Our son is now 22 and lives on his own in London.  
  
What matters to us, as a family, is, in order of priority:   
\- Access to nice areas to walk/cycle in (walking for my wife, road cycling for me)  
\- A fairly quick and uncongested road to the airport for me; access to public transport for my wife.  
\- Security  
\- A squash club nearby  
\- Would be great to be within walking distance from a nice, friendly coffee shop and, perhaps, something like a small Tesco/Sainsbury.   
\- Access to open water (the sea or a river etc.)  
\- Reasonable distance from a town centre for when the mood takes us (not often)

With this in mind, could you please help me understand why we would go for Glasgow over Aberdeen? And - if we do go for Glasgow - which areas would you be looking at? 

We only want a one-bed, max two-bed, nothing fancy.

It‚Äôs called **Tabby** and it works like this:

* Just message your expense (e.g. `Lunch $12`)
* Choose your category and Tabby will remember it
* You can set monthly budgets, view summaries, and even split group expenses
* For personal expenses, you can open a **Mini App** right within Telegram to view **detailed graphs, category breakdowns, and budget insights** \- all in a clean, interactive dashboard

üéØ No new apps to download. No complex setup. Just track where your money‚Äôs going in the app you already use daily.

üìä It syncs with Notion, sends reminders if you forget to log, and gives weekly/monthly reports to keep you on track.

  
I‚Äôm still putting the finishing touches on the first version - but the waitlist is now open at [www.tabbyfinance.app](http://www.tabbyfinance.app), and I'm aiming to launch in under a month. Early users will get access first.

Plus, sometimes we just can‚Äôt control our cravings, and with too much food intake, our bodies can‚Äôt keep up, leading to weight gain. üò©But, fear not! If you want to lose weight with half the effort, the most important principle is to speed up your metabolism and get rid of dampness! Here are some easy weight loss tips that even the laziest of us can follow. Grab your notepads, girls! üìù1. Change Your Eating Habits:‚Ä¢ Control Your Plate Size: Use a smaller plate to trick your brain into thinking you‚Äôre eating more, thus reducing your meal size. This little trick is simple and practical!‚Ä¢ No Eating After 8 PM: Here‚Äôs a nifty tip, brush your teeth early, and you‚Äôll avoid late-night snacks just because you can‚Äôt be bothered to brush your teeth again. Clever, right? üòè2. Adequate Sleep:‚Ä¢ Drink Water Instead of Sugary Drinks: Replace sugary drinks with plain water, unsweetened tea, or black coffee to cut down on extra sugar and calories. Let me introduce you to a natural herbal tea‚ÄîPyru tea. For those who always have an oily face and a bit of a tummy, this tea is for you! üçµ3. Increase Daily Activity:‚Ä¢ Stand More, Sit Less: Try to stand more at work or use a standing desk to reduce sitting time.‚Ä¢ Walk Instead of Drive: Opt for walking or cycling for short trips to increase your daily activity.‚Ä¢ Take the Stairs: Choose the stairs over the elevator to engage your leg muscles and burn more calories.‚Ä¢ Exercise While Watching TV: Do some simple step-ups or jog in place while watching TV to increase activity during downtime.4. Use ChatGBT for Weight Loss:‚Ä¢ Set achievable goals, like cutting out 500 calories a day, and then use ChatGBT to create a personalized weight loss plan that you can stick to and turn into a habit.Lastly, make sure to get plenty of sleep and keep your spirits high. Lack of sleep can affect your mood and metabolism, making you more likely to overeat. üò¥Girls, losing weight isn‚Äôt about quick fixes; it‚Äôs about incorporating small changes into our daily lives. With these little adjustments, we can reach our goals more easily and healthily.

1m8uazf,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wattpad/comments/1m8uazf/first_chapter_of_deadly_devotion_i_just_posted_it/,"First chapter of ""Deadly Devotion"" I just posted it on Wattpad wanted to see opinions on it since it took me a sec to get the story out","""I'm innocent, I tell you! You have to believe me!"" Cried the man in handcuffs, slumping in the empty room.

I peered in through the one-way mirror. The chilling air of the police station doing little to hide the shiver that goes down my spine at the look in that man's eyes. I have seen many like him. They can beg and plead all they wish, in the end I see through the facade.

His eyes are filled with panic, begging to be let go as if we had tortured him. Yet just as they were filled with fear, they were empty of remorse for the one he wronged. He feared for his own freedom, yet no want for his consequences for the crimes he committed. What sat in that room isn't a man, it's a monster.

I took a deep breath in through my nose, closed my eyes, then released through my mouth. I repeated this a few times before grabbing the case file. I paused a moment as my hand touched the door handle. The room faded as my heart drummed in my ears.

As quickly as the feeling came I had shaken it off, opened the door and sat down across from the man.
I couldn't even bring myself to look him in the eyes. People like him sicken me.

I squeezed my hand under the table. Slowly I brought my gaze to his, hardening my own so he can't see the weakness he most likely saw in his victim.

He was disheveled in appearance, his short brown hair nowhere neatly cut. He had the gaze of someone simply feigning fear, not genuine in the slightest. I found myself looking at the tremors in his hands. The frantic look to him that would surely suggest at a man not in the right mind.

I clear my throat, and leaned forward to turn on the recorder to the left of me.¬†""Before this session starts, please state your name and age for me sir."" I kept my voice even as I looked him in the eyes.
This is my job. Fear has no place here.

""Liam Johnson,"" he mutters near out of breath from all the thrashing he had done earlier, ""I am twenty-four.""

I glanced him over, he looked more like he was in his late thirties. You wouldn't guess he's a young adult at first glance.

I sit up, straightening my back and putting my hands on the file to seem more intimidating then I actually am. ""You understand why your here then?""

""I didn't kill her, you have to believe me!"" His voice grated on my ears.

""I never claimed you did. However, Mr. Johnson you have not made yourself appear any less guilty. Just tell me your side of the story. That is all I ask."" 

I spoke to him like he was a person, at the end of the day this game of cat and mouse has already been won. There wasn't much sense in making him whine any more than what I need to listen to.

""You see I was..."" As he explained the less I truly listened. His words aren't what I was looking for. It was the tension he had in his body, his actions mirroring mine, as if subconsciously trying to convince me he is no different from me.

After he was finished I didn't speak for a long time. I didn't miss the way he watched for my reactions just as I was his. So, to test my theory I bit the inside of my cheek, to which he copied a moment later. ""That is all?"" I ask, giving him one more chance to speak without pressure.

""Yes."" He replied, feigning relief thinking I bought such a poor crafted story. I've seen better lying in five-year-old's then whatever he was trying to convince me of.

I took in a sharp breath, my jaw clenched as my leg bounced under the table. I opened the file. To which his true colors showed when every picture in it was his crime poorly hidden from cameras in the area.

Suddenly he went silent. The look in his eyes were cold, almost empty as he stared at the photos. The tremors were out of sight, his body completely still as he stared at the undeniable evidence.

The following confession to the murder was cold and without any remorse. Another man's mask taken off as the monster beneath spoke. All I did was listen and watch his calm collected demeanor as he did. His body eerily still now that he wasn't trying to convince me of his innocence.

I watched the officers take him back to his cell after his confession. Yet I remained in the room for a moment longer than necessary, the cold words repeating in my mind like a broken record.

I took deep breaths to steady myself. My heart drumming in my ears once more.¬†Instead of waiting for it to stop, I decided to refocus. I picked the file up and walked back to my office.

The office I have looks to be as new as the day I received it. No pictures, no posters, no decorations, nothing but my work.
The only real sign of a person in there is the board with pictures and messy notes pinned to it. My desk just as messy with files, the trash can filled to the brim with crumpled paper and empty coffee cups.

There was dust collecting on the shelf, books from the previous detective left there. I never cared to see what they were, It wasn't much of my business anyway.

I take the file for the Johnson case, putting it away in my solved bin to be taken for storage later. I sit down, grabbing another case file to begin working on.

However, my attention is brought away from what I was doing to a little tune of a knock. Chief Andrew, a constant joy-filled distraction to my work.

""Hey, hey! Good work on the case detective Holt."" He exclaimed with a proud smile. Then he puts down a water bottle on my desk. ""Looking a little dehydrated."" He smiles reassuringly, but nothing felt reassuring about it.

I held my breath a moment before releasing it, my fingers twirled the loose strands of my hair as I looked up to meet his warm gaze with my unfeeling one.

""How thoughtful."" My voice colder than what I had meant it to be. Yet his smile didn't waver to my coldness.

""Aw, Elise what's with the long face? You should be proud of your hard work. Why not take a break?"" He leans against my desk his smile warm. ""I'm taking the station out for drinks, why don't you come this time? It'll be fun.""

""There is nothing to be proud of when we scrape through blood for a living"" I simply said, unable to keep the irritation from my voice when he suggested the idea of being proud of my work. ""Besides that, losing my senses at a bar isn't exactly my idea of fun.""

As always, that smile never falls from his face. His amusement growing with my denial. ""Oh detective,"" he began before sitting on the edge of my desk. The wood groaning in protest.

""It isn't about taking pride in the job. It's about rewarding yourself for your hard work."" He chuckles amused by my irritation. ""Who would try to mess with a group of cops? Don't be so paranoid. Even if someone tries it, I got your back. Just like everyone else here.""

""No, I won't go."" I said plainly. My eyebrows furrowing in annoyance to his persistence.¬†¬†

He smiles warmly, as he pushed the water bottle closer in front of me. Almost silently telling me to take care of myself.¬†""I understand, maybe next time detective Holt.""

I watch as he walks away. Once the door closes I begin taking deep breaths. My fingers fidgeting with the fabric of my white button up shirt as I ground myself to what is important. The next case.

*Welcome to* [***Open-Wheel Madness***](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenWheelMadness/)*.¬† By no means an expert, I want to start things off by sharing my thoughts on IndyCar and F1 (and NASCAR to a lesser degree), and I am hoping to generate a productive discussion about how Indy can improve.¬† This article features a lot of my opinions, so feel free to disagree and teach, but please do not sue me.¬† I am always looking to learn, so ladies and gentlemen, start your engines!*¬†

***Note****: I know that some Brits may be offended by me putting punctuation inside quotes.¬† Well, 250 years ago, we Americans fought a war over things like that.¬† Deal with it.¬† Plus, there are a ton of other things in this article to be offended by.¬† Lastly, I also still use two spaces after a period, but I am trying very hard to break that insidious habit.*

I am a huge fan of both Indy and F1, and if I had to pick, I think that I would go with Indy ‚Äî probably, maybe?¬† For me, I like the fact that anyone starting as far back as 20th on the grid can finish on the podium.¬† I enjoy that Indy, in general, is far less sanitized than F1.¬† There is more car contact, fewer penalties, more passing, less whining, and more access to drivers, who, in turn, are more honest and open with the media.¬† Indy teams are more like a family, whereas F1 drivers do not appear to have much love or concern for their teammates (the F1 Movie was laughable in this sense).¬† Sometimes, F1 drivers come off as spoiled brats, especially when they winge about competitors who drive with their elbows out.¬† I hate it when the focus of an F1 race comes down to rule interpretations and infinitesimal measurements that unlikely affected the end results; there is a saying about officiating in basketball that often enters my mind at those times ‚Äî ‚ÄúJust let them play!‚Äù¬† Then again, when [**Will Power**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Power) (not my pun) pushes another car around the track like a snowplow in Anchorage, he probably does deserve some type of penalty.¬†¬†

Indy, to me, actually appears to be more challenging for drivers, who have to deal with far more immoveable walls, bumpy, rough, uneven tarmacs, and a huge variation in track types, all WITHOUT power steering.¬† I‚Äôm not remotely saying that [**Alex Palou**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%81lex_Palou) is better than [**Max Verstappen**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Verstappen).¬† I do think that Palou could be competitive in F1, but I think his main strength, much like his wiley teammate [**Scott Dixon**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Dixon), is playing the long game, which isn‚Äôt overly helpful in F1, where race outcomes are greatly determined on Saturday.¬† I do firmly believe that Max is far superior to [**Kyle Lawson**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyle_Larson)**,** who has [claimed that he‚Äôs the better driver](https://www.on3.com/pro/news/kyle-larson-doubles-down-on-max-verstappen-comments-addresses-detractors/) ‚Äî pick any car on any track with an actual tarmac, Max would likely win even if he spotted Lawson a lap or two.¬†¬†

Compared to IndyCar, or NASCAR for that matter, F1 driving is much more on point and precise, and I believe that the stats show that winning in Indy is easier than winning in F1.¬† [**Mario Andretti**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mario_Andretti), [**Nigel Mansell**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nigel_Mansell), [**Emerson Fittipaldi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emerson_Fittipaldi), [**Jacques Villeneuve**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques_Villeneuve), and [**Juan Pablo Montoya**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Pablo_Montoya) were very successful in both series.¬† Andretti, Mansell, Fittipaldi, and Villeneuve all found it easier to be successful on the Indy side.¬† Montoya had better success in F1, but that was during his prime years; starting in his 30s, he was mainly in NASCAR, where he struggled.¬† [**Romain Grosjean**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romain_Grosjean) was middling at both but was statistically more successful in Indy.¬† [**Marcus Ericsson**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Ericsson) has been far more successful on the Indy side, including one Indy 500 win, but he isn‚Äôt considered to be among the top drivers.¬† Another Indy 500 winner, [**Alexander Rossi**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Rossi), had a cup of coffee in F1 before becoming a very competitive Indy driver.¬† [**Robert Shwartzman**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Shwartzman) recently came through the F1 system before committing to Indy as a rookie this year, but I have serious doubts about him; he won pole at the Indy 500 and then ran over his crew in the pits during the race.¬†

At [the Indy 500](https://www.indianapolismotorspeedway.com/events/indy500/history/historical-stats/driver-stats?page=2) alone, former F1 champions have a good track record (pun intended).¬† Legendary Scotsman [**Jimmy Clark**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Clark), a two-time champion who dominated F1 in the early 60s, had one win and three top-5 finishes in five attempts at the 500, while fellow two-time F1 Champ [**Graham Hill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graham_Hill) had three starts with one victory.¬† Mansel won it once in just two attempts, Villeneuve had one win and two top-5s in only three races, and Fittipaldi had two wins and four top-5s in 11 races.¬†¬†

Not all F1 champs have enjoyed their time at the Indy 500, however.¬† Andretti, who had more than three times the number of starts in Indy than in F1, raced at the 500 a total of 29 times (1965-1994), with many of those races coming beyond his prime.¬† [Andretti was ‚Äúcursed‚Äù](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andretti_curse) when it came to the 500, completing all 500 miles just five times, but he did manage one victory and six top-5s.¬† He also had [one of the most infamous 500 accidents](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sT3swI7y6DY) during an unplanned qualifying practice in 2003 at the age of 63.¬† Three-time F1 Champion, and a champion of driver safety as well, [**Sir Jackie Stewart**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Stewart) had just one top-10 in two attempts, and the ageless [**Fernando Alonso**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fernando_Alonso), a two-time F1 Champ who has finished on F1 podiums roughly 26 percent of the time, has had no luck in his two attempts to win the Indy 500.¬†¬†

In sum, the eight former F1 Champions mentioned above earned a total of seven victories and 17 top-5 finishes in 57 races at the Indy 500, with a winning percentage of 12.3 and a top-5 percentage of 29.8.¬† Those numbers are skewed negatively by Andretti, who is generally considered more of an Indy than an F1 driver.¬† For comparison, consider a pair of Indy legends, [**Al Unser**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Unser) and [**A.J. Foyt**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A._J._Foyt), two of the four drivers to earn a record-tying four Indy 500 wins.¬† That duo had a combined eight victories and 23 top-5s in 62 starts for a winning percentage of 12.9 and a top-5 percentage of 37.1.

All in all, the stats say that Indy is easier, but how much is that due to money?¬† [F1 drivers make roughly ten times as much as IndyCar drivers](https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/motor/2023/03/23/indycar-vs-formula-one-drivers-car-size-salary-popularity-costs/69995865007/).¬† Could it be that the world‚Äôs best drivers are in F1 and that collective superior driving ability from top to bottom supersedes the more difficult driving conditions in Indy?¬† In other words, it may not matter so much what series you are in; what really matters is how good the other drivers in the series are.¬† If you combined the top 15-20 F1 drivers with the top 10-15 Indy drivers and had them compete at both levels, say 15 races each for a total of 30, might we see some Indy drivers finishing above some F1 drivers?¬† I think we definitely would.¬† Compared to F1, Indy is the wild west, and I don‚Äôt know if some F1 drivers could deal with the variety of challenges that Indy drivers face.¬† It should also be noted that Palou, [**Colton Herta**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colton_Herta), and [**Pato O'Ward**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pato_O%27Ward) have all been courted by F1 teams, though, surprisingly only [Herta appears to be in contention for one of the two open F1 seats with the new Cadillac Team](https://www.newsweek.com/sports/racing/cadillac-f1-team-boss-reveals-big-driver-names-contending-2026-seat-2101425).¬†¬†

As fun as my fantasy Indy-F1 competition sounds, it‚Äôs not going to happen.¬† As a whole, F1 clearly looks down on Indy with more than a whiff of royal-like superiority, which clearly annoys the hell out of many Americans.¬† The GOAT ‚Äî the MJ of racing (and don‚Äôt even start) ‚Äî [**Michael Schumacher**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schumacher) thought Indy was [too dangerous and the primary landing spot for drivers who could not cut it in F1](https://www.gpfans.com/us/f1-news/1021786/f1-michael-schumacher-interview-reveals-controversial-criticism-f1-rivals-indycar/), while his fierce rival, [**Ayrton Senna**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ayrton_Senna), considered Indy for only a minute.¬† But more than that, F1 is now all about glitz and glamor.¬† The race tracks are mostly pristine, and the cars are significantly more expensive and have roughly 130 percent more horsepower. F1 races are held at places such as Monaco and Las Vegas, where millionaires and billionaires grace the paddocks, while IndyCar has races in Detroit and Birmingham, Alabama, where you could conceivably catch a stray bullet from a gang war or a drunken hunter.¬† Jokes aside, Barber Sports Park features a beautiful track and facilities (but Alabama is among the leading US states for fatal shootings).¬† On the other hand, t[he FIA respects Indy enough to rank it just slightly below F2 in terms of the ability to earn SuperLicense points](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIA_Super_Licence), which says a lot.¬†¬†

Though improving, Indy still [lags far behind F1 (globally)](https://frontstretch.com/2022/01/10/the-most-popular-motorsports-in-the-world/) and [NASCAR (nationally)](https://thesportsrush.com/nascar-news-steve-phelps-reveals-nascars-biggest-rival-in-the-united-states-and-it-is-not-f1-or-indycar/) in terms of popularity.¬† Just ask the bookies, who often don‚Äôt even post odds for most IndyCar races.¬† With its storied history, I highly doubt that IndyCar is in any danger of going away, but at the same time, it makes me mad and sad to see the sport bringing up the rear.¬† I see the greatness in Indy, and I want the sport to have more respect.¬† I believe that Indy has a compelling combination of grittiness, toughness, strategy, science, and unpredictability that in many ways is more appealing than F1 (and NASCAR, if that needed to be said).¬† I actually believe that Indy features much of the best of both worlds (F1 and NASCAR).

At the same time, I do not believe that Indy should try to compete with NASCAR.¬† I apologize ahead of time to NASCAR fans, but in my opinion, it‚Äôs somewhat like racing for Neanderthals, whose brains hurt when they have to contemplate science, math, strategy, and tire temps (what‚Äôs downforce?).¬† Listen, I get it.¬† I respect the rebellious history of NASCAR, and I also understand how the sport is relatable to the common man, like me.¬† But, NASCAR fans, are you not interested in pushing the outermost limits, *where only Gods dare tread?*¬† Are you not interested in fighting a full-out war with gravity and drag, not to mention time (the faster you go, the slower you age)?¬† Indy and F1 attempt to create the fastest road cars in the world, and many of us would give anything to personally experience that speed, but we must settle for viscerally watching those who can.¬† To me, NASCAR is just mundane in comparison (but I will take any calls offering an opportunity to drive a [Ford Mustang Dark Horse](https://www.motortrend.com/news/2024-ford-mustang-dark-horse-pros-cons-review) at 200 MPH).¬† The most damning verdict of NASCAR comes from the FIA; in terms of SuperLicense points, the FIA has little respect for NASCAR, ranking the competition at 17th, the same as Indy NXT and far below IndyCar, F2, and F3.¬†¬†

So, what to do?¬† For starters, IndyCar has to begin by drawing more young people to its races and expand the season with **at least three additional races**.¬† The new events should NOT be in the US; they should be in places such as Mexico City, S√£o Paulo, Buenos Aires, Montreal, Circuit Zandvoort in Holland, and Imola, Italy.¬† Americans do not appear to appreciate the complexities of open-wheel racing, but the rest of the world loves it.¬† At the same time, close to 60 percent of the 2025 IndyCar drivers are not American, including [six of the top seven in the current NTT standings](https://www.indycar.com/Standings).¬† Why have a ‚Äúdoubleheader‚Äù at a poorly attended Iowa Raceway when you could pack the house with Pato fans in Mexico City?¬† IndyCar has [not raced outside North America for more than a decade](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IndyCar_Series_racetracks#:~:text=Since%201996%2C%20INDYCAR%20events%20have,Canada%2C%20Australia%2C%20and%20Brazil.), and those in power will say it‚Äôs too expensive, but that‚Äôs extremely short sighted.¬† Open-wheel racing is the future, likely everywhere but America, and there has never been a better time than now to capitalize on that potential.¬† Think of NASCAR as the NFL while open-wheel is soccer/football.¬† In terms of world popularity, the NFL cannot come close to competing with soccer, and it never will, but that‚Äôs a story for another day.¬†¬†

With better attendance at Indy events and more attention from the rest of the world, the money would begin flowing in various ways ‚Äî merchandise, gate receipts, advertising dollars, and so on.¬† And popularity snowballs if you play your cards right.¬† However, even with new races, there would be more to be done.¬† For example, the podium celebrations need to change, immediately.¬† As it is now, the end of an Indy race has the look and the energy of a Cub Scout Pinewood Derby competition at the local high school gym.¬† There are no fans to be seen, and the podiums are about as unimpressive as one could imagine, kinda like my neighbor‚Äôs deck on July 4th but worse.¬† The end of nearly every IndyCar race is anticlimactic and somewhat depressing.¬† FFS, IndyCar, get the fans involved, pay fake fans if you must, but the end of each race should be a glorious celebration!

Another thing that kills both IndyCar and NASCAR in the eyes of the world is commercials, OMG!¬† The last time that I attempted to watch the Dayton 500, I had to turn it off because it was commercial after commercial.¬† TV as we have known it is dying fast, partially due to the damn ads.¬† Personally, I have not watched a live event for five or more years; I watch everything on delay so I can blow by all of those annoying, prepubescent, and brainwashing advertisements.¬† Last weekend, while watching the replay of IndyCar at Toronto, I nearly had a stroke when Fox was taking a commercial break while a multi-car, literal pileup was happening, SMH.¬† The one thing you certainly cannot dislike about F1 is the race is shown commercial free, which is the way it should be.¬† Open-wheel has so many intricacies and so much strategy, and fans don‚Äôt want to miss a second (I like to think that there‚Äôs a little bit of [**Bernie Collins**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bernadette_Collins) in all of us).¬† Again, Indy has to change its thinking if it wants to appeal to a wider audience, and showing the entire race without commercials (or very limited commercials) would be a huge step in the right direction.¬†¬†

I will say that Fox Sports has done a nice job with its coverage of Indy ‚Äî a significant upgrade over NBC Sports.¬† The ads to promote the sport in the preseason were slick and fun, and the entire weekend production has a better feel.¬† The announcing teams, both in the commentary box and in the pit, are informative, fun, and intelligent.¬† Of course, much of the crew came from NBC, but the additions of [**Jack ‚ÄúHollywood‚Äù Harvey**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_Harvey_(racing_driver)) on the grid and [**Will Buxton**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_Buxton) in the booth have been outstanding.¬† Besides the incessant commercials, the only thing that I can complain about is the lack of a compelling pre-race show.¬† The current pre-race production is too short; Hollywood's grid walk needs to be longer and feature more interesting people to talk with (and more closeups of his hair), and the show should have more in-depth looks at the drivers, the teams, and the history of the sport.¬† And this is where Fox can put its shite commercials.¬†¬†

A common theme I often hear from F1 fans who are checking out Indy to see if it might interest them is, ‚ÄúWho the hell is who?¬† Who is on what team?¬† Why do guys from different teams have cars that look the same?¬† Why do guys on the same team have cars that look totally different? Why is he in a different car this week?‚Äù¬† I hear ya, F1 brethren.¬† If you're transitioning from F1 to Indy, it appears to be total chaos, and keeping track of who is who can even be difficult for the race commentators.¬† On the other hand, it can be difficult to tell teammates apart in F1 because their liveries look exactly the same, and all of the colorful variations in Indy are fun.¬† I think there is an easy solution that would eliminate some of the confusion ‚Äî all teammates should always share some clear-cut and highly visable commonality on their liveries, such as a large team logo on the top of the rear wings.¬† The European teams, McLaren and Prema, already do a pretty good job in making their cars recognizable, so I don‚Äôt see why this should be a huge issue for IndyCar as a whole.

Now let‚Äôs talk about women, who make up a huge[ portion of the growing F1 fan base](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/formula-1-and-motorsport-network-unveil-2025-global-fan-survey.4YqMebNy8BLaapyJfjzDXO), and if you click on that previous link, you‚Äôll read that F1 is totally in tune with that development.¬† I think there are a lot of reasons why women love F1, but one primary thing that many [new female F1 fans talk about is the Netflix show ‚ÄúDrive to Survive.‚Äù](https://depauliaonline.com/76324/sports/formulanomenon-female-viewership-is-driving-a-new-wave-of-popularity-for-formula-1/#:~:text=Formulanomenon!%20Female%20viewership%20is%20driving,She's%20not%20the%20only%20one.)¬† This polished production does a fantastic job at creating and building drama, and it gives viewers the feeling that they know the drivers and those working behind the scenes.¬† At the same time, Indy currently does a lousy job of allowing fans to ‚Äúget to know‚Äù the drivers and the decision makers, and to see all of the drama in between.¬† I‚Äôm not necessarily suggesting an Indy ‚ÄúDrive to Survive,‚Äù though it doesn‚Äôt sound like a bad idea.¬† I think a weekly in-season, behind-the-scenes show might even be better.¬†¬†

How about the sport itself?¬† Can IndyCar improve the competition?¬† Yes, it can, and it would entail more copycatting of F1.¬† First of all, the Honda vs. Chevy competition means fuck all to most of the world ‚Äî we don‚Äôt care!¬† Our relatives don‚Äôt work at either factory, and Japan has been a good ally for more than 75 years.¬† What‚Äôs needed is a serious team competition to add a new layer of drama, similar to the [Constructors Championship in F1](https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/the-beginners-guide-to-the-f1-constructors-championship.66nTfWSqrUYv3bnbosPkHV).¬† Yes, I know that Indy teams are uneven in numbers, some teams cooperate with each other, and there is the ‚ÄúLeaders Circle,‚Äù which is publicly discussed less than most national security secrets.¬† Seriously, go to [IndyCar.com](http://indycar.com) and see how much information you can find on the Leaders Circle.¬† Come on, Indy, let‚Äôs have some cut-throat team competition, and promote it while you're at it.¬†¬†

Speaking of ‚Äúconstruction,‚Äù very unlike F1, [Indy cars are very much the same](https://www.indycar.com/Fan-Info/INDYCAR-101/Introduction-To-INDYCAR/Anatomy-Of-An-INDYCAR#:~:text=Manufacturers:%20American%20Honda%20Motor%20Co,Terms%20of%20Use), with the main exceptions being the Honda or Chevy engines and [the dampers](https://www.the-race.com/indycar/indycars-hidden-development-war-explained/).¬† Now, the cars can vary significantly in terms of setup, and the in-race adjustments by both the drivers and the teams are very critical.¬† However, in theory, two teams could be using the same setups, and the drivers for those two teams could be making the same in-race adjustments (extremely unlikely but theoretically possible).¬† The difference in the engines has been interesting this season, as Chevy seems to have more speed but poorer gas mileage, and I think the latter factor has been critical in Honda‚Äôs dominance this season.¬† Nevertheless, as I said, I don‚Äôt think many outside the teams and engine manufacturers care much about the engine competition.¬†¬†

In F1, there are similarities among the cars; for example, there are just four different types of engines used by the current ten teams (don‚Äôt ever buy a Renault), and they all use the same tire manufacture, with three different tire (not tyre) options for each race, not counting two types wets.¬† BUT, there is a reason why they call it the Constructors Championship.¬† Though [there can be some commonality of parts among the different teams](https://www.the-race.com/formula-1/f1-2022s-new-parts-categories-explained/#:~:text=Formula%201%20has%20four%20formal%20parts%20designations,the%20FIA.%20SSCs%20include:%20*%20Wheel%20covers), the potential differences between F1 cars are virtually infinite.¬† That‚Äôs why all the James Bond stuff goes on in F1 ‚Äî they spy on each other, steal from each other, and tattle on each other, like bratty 5-year-olds.¬† It‚Äôs kinda humorous, but it‚Äôs also deadly serious business that can amount to millions of Euros.¬† The cost of [development and construction of the new 2026 F1 models is estimated to be somewhere between $15-21 million](https://carsjovo.com/mercedes-amg-f1-car-cost-team-running-expenses-2025/) each, which is [more than the entire budgets of some Indy teams](https://racer.com/2025/02/25/why-do-indycar-team-budgets-keep-climbing).

And that‚Äôs the crux between F1 and IndyCar ‚Äî money!¬† F1 has investors that can probably afford to buy entire countries, at least Greenland.¬† That‚Äôs not to say that billionaire IndyCar owner [**Roger Penske**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roger_Penske) is poor (definitely cranky, though), but the total amount of money invested in and made by F1 is in another league ‚Äî think of the NFL vs. UFL (or USFL or XXXL or whatever it‚Äôs called these days).¬† Without a huge influx of money, we will never see Indy cars differentiating much, which is a shame because that, too, adds another layer of strategy, drama, and intrigue.¬† Some might say the differentiating between the rich and the poor teams ruins F1, but have they ever watched ‚Äú[Brawn: The Impossible Formula 1 Story](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt22297946/),‚Äù which should have been the basis for the F1 Movie?¬† And doesn‚Äôt the rich-poor effect already exist in IndyCar, too?¬† We all know the potential for Indy to be more profitable is there, and if the income does significantly increase over time, there should be a gradual shift to differentiate the construction between teams.¬† And as I said before, even under the current IndyCar structure, there could be a more interesting team competition, with a little effort and creativity.¬†¬†

If money is the issue, what about IndyCar merging with F2?¬† The Indy 500 was included in the F1 Championship from 1950 to 1960, and according to the FIA, the two competitions are perfectly on par, which probably isn‚Äôt true because I suspect a good number of the F2 kids would flounder under IndyCar conditions and competition.¬† Former F2 drivers currently in Indy include Shwartzman, [**Christian Lundgaard**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christian_Lundgaard), [**Marcus Armstrong**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marcus_Armstrong), and [**Callum Ilott**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Callum_Ilott), so, from a competitive standpoint, some of the F2 youngsters should be able to battle with the grizzled Indy vets, but for most, I doubt it would be ideal conditions for growth and development.¬† It would be a trial by fire for sure, however.¬†¬†

From an F1 perspective, there may not be a good reason to merge F2 and Indy‚Äî things are going swimmingly as is.¬† From an Indy fan perspective, it sounds fantastic, at least to me ‚Äî let‚Äôs get an injection of money into the sport and see if our drivers are as good as we think.¬† Indy ownership, however, seems to be old-school, stubborn, and resistant to change, which might be a fatal flaw in a business sense.¬† Logistically, which series melds into the other?¬† Indy and F1 may look similar at first glance, but they‚Äôre really not the same animal.¬† F1 would likely resist adopting many of the things we love about Indy ‚Äî the grittiness, the contact, the limited officiating, and the crazy tracks.¬† F1 would likely want F2-Indy to be a feeder system for F1, and that would likely mean all F1 rules and conditions would have to apply.¬† In sum, I‚Äôd love to see it happen if the two series could meet in the middle, but I‚Äôd bet that F1 would be an inflexible negotiating partner in this scenario.¬†¬†

I think a better option would be a different type alignment with F1, one where IndyCar is the next step after F2 and is also a place where very popular drivers, such as [**Danny Ricciardo**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Ricciardo), can race, remain highly visible, and be paid a relatively competitive salary.¬† This F1-Indy venture would require a true meeting in the middle to preserve some of IndyCar‚Äôs uniqueness and positive qualities, but also would require Indy to be more like F1 so that drivers can transition in between series with minimal adjustment.¬† If another [**Kimi Antonelli**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Kimi_Antonelli) is flourishing in F2, he can make the direct jump to F1.¬† In the case of a Lundgaard or an Armstrong, they can move to Indy, earn a better salary, and gain valuable experience against veterans, but still have a path to F1.¬† Again, the attraction for Indy would be a huge influx of cash and more world exposure, while the attraction for F1 would be another potential money making machine and a feeder system that would feature late bloomers and highly experienced backups if needed.¬† Perhaps I am being naive with these merger ideas but doesn‚Äôt it sound fun?

As things are, I see IndyCar as a combination of F1 and NASCAR, and I like that for the most part.¬† I wish Indy drivers had more of a chance to test their mettle vs. their F1 counterparts, and I wish the sport had more respect in general.¬† In order for the series to flourish, I believe that Indy leadership needs to wake up.¬† The world is changing fast, as fast as an [RB19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Bull_Racing_RB19), and old-school thinking won‚Äôt work.¬† Indy shouldn‚Äôt compete with NASCAR in America; instead, it needs to expand globally and adopt many of the strategies that have worked so well for F1.¬† Indy will always take a backseat to F1 globally and may always have to do the same with NASCAR nationally, but being No. 2 in the world wouldn‚Äôt be so bad ‚Äî at a minimum, Indy could afford better podiums.¬† üôÇ

Desire ile alakalƒ± derlediƒüim bilgiler;

Bob Dylan‚Äôƒ±n 1976 yƒ±lƒ±nda yayƒ±mlanan Desire alb√ºm√º, Bob Dylan‚Äôƒ±n politik a√ßƒ±dan en g√º√ßl√º i≈ülerinden biridir. Alb√ºm, Dylan‚Äôƒ±n Rolling Thunder Revue turnesiyle paralel bir d√∂nemde kaydedilmi≈ü ve bu d√∂nemin enerjisini ve teatral havasƒ±nƒ± yansƒ±tmaktadƒ±r. 

Desire, Dylan‚Äôƒ±n √∂nceki alb√ºmlerine g√∂re daha kolektif bir yapƒ±m s√ºreciyle dikkat √ßeker; √∂zellikle kemancƒ± Scarlet Rivera‚Äônƒ±n katkƒ±sƒ±, alb√ºm√ºn e≈üsiz atmosferinin olu≈ümasƒ±nda b√ºy√ºk rol oynar. Alb√ºm√ºn a√ßƒ±lƒ±≈ü par√ßasƒ± ‚ÄúHurricane‚Äù, haksƒ±z yere mahkum edilen boks√∂r Rubin Carter‚Äôƒ±n hik√¢yesini anlatƒ±r ve Dylan‚Äôƒ±n sosyal adaletsizliklere kar≈üƒ± duyarlƒ±lƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ± a√ßƒ±k√ßa ortaya koyar. ‚ÄúIsis‚Äù par√ßasƒ± ise mistik √∂gelerle bezeli, epik bir a≈ük ve ke≈üif hik√¢yesi sunar. 

≈ûarkƒ± s√∂zleri genel olarak uzun, anlatƒ± odaklƒ± ve edebi bir dille yazƒ±lmƒ±≈ütƒ±r; bu y√∂n√ºyle Dylan‚Äôƒ±n ≈üair kimliƒüi en √ßok bu alb√ºmde belirginle≈ümi≈ütir.

*A deep cold dark lullaby""*

Elian's world, once a quiet, gray expanse, was now filled with the vibrant, chaotic color of Rian. He hadn't known how easily she would fold into the blank corners of his days, how quickly her presence would become the new anchor for his reality.

They fell into a routine that felt both new and anciently familiar. They would meet at the ramen shop. They would share a paper cup of coffee at the 24-hour stand under a flickering neon sign, and she would tease him for taking it black. ""You must hate yourself to drink it that way,"" she'd say. He'd just shrug. ""Habit.""

Sometimes, they would walk home together under a single, battered umbrella, their shoulders bumping when the wind blew. He learned the sound of her laugh, the way she would bite her lip when she was thinking, the pattern of freckles across her nose. Each detail was a new, precious piece of data in a life that had been terrifyingly empty.

But at night, when she slept beside him, her warmth a solid, comforting presence against his side, the other thing, the blankness, would whisper to him from the dark.

Far above, on Orbital Ring A-17, the alarms began to hiss. Mila hunched over the console, her face illuminated by the frantic, flashing red lights. Lines of corrupted drift signals pulsed and broke across her screen, the static bursts centered on Aero's faint, hidden life signature.

Kai's boots clicked against the grated floor behind her. ""You're in here again?"" he asked, his voice sharp. ""I thought we patched that core loop last week.""

Mila didn't look at him, her eyes raw, her fingers twitching at the keys. ""It's not patched,"" she said, her voice tight with a fear she couldn't explain. ""It's changing. Every hour, the patterns shift. If he's in there, it's burning him alive.""

Kai frowned, scanning the mess of red and green traces on the screen. He didn't know what he was seeing, just spikes and dips and impossible hums in the drift data. No one had told him what this machine really was. No one was left alive to ask. ""Mila,"" he said, his voice softening slightly, ""even if he's alive in there, you can't...""

On a rainy Tuesday, Rian asked him, her voice a soft murmur against the sound of the downpour on the thin roof, ""Do you ever feel like you're someone else? Like you're living a life that doesn't belong to you?""

His breath caught in his throat. For a dizzying second, her face flickered, the edges blurring, and he saw a different woman, older, sharper, her eyes filled with a weary, fierce intelligence. It was not Rian, but something behind her eyes. He blinked, and she was just her again, smiling tiredly at him.

""You're weird tonight,"" he said, his voice rough, forcing a laugh he didn't feel.

She pressed her palm to his cheek, her touch cool and gentle. ""Promise me something?""

""What?""

""If you ever feel like you're drowning,"" she said, her eyes serious, ""call out. Just... call your name. So you don't sink.""

He didn't understand. But a part of him, the part that hummed those lost, broken lullabies when sleep wouldn't come, filed the words away, a key for a lock he didn't know he was trapped behind.

On the Ring, the alarms shrieked, a high, piercing wail that the ancient system barely managed to produce anymore. Kai slammed a fist on the console's rail. ""This is bad. The drift temperature is spiking. What the hell did you switch on?""

Mila's eyes were wide with terror. She hadn't switched anything on. The signals-Aero's signal-had flared on its own, tangled with the ghost process she had nudged awake months ago.

In his apartment, Aero squeezed his eyes shut, the world tilting around him. ""I don't want to go,"" he whispered, the words a desperate plea.

Rian's voice was a soft, seductive whisper in his ear. ""Then stay. Stay with me."" She smiled, but the edges of her smile began to split like old paper. The Catalyst's true, ravenous hunger flickered behind her borrowed face.

His chest burned. His head felt like it would tear in half. The blankness was gone, replaced by a roaring, chaotic storm.

*Say it,* a voice that was not Rian's urged from within his own mind. *Tear me open if you have to. Cut the chain.*

Aero's throat closed. He looked at Rian-at the warmth, the soft echo of everything he had ever wanted-and he saw the fracture beneath, the corrupted code that held the illusion together. It was not her. It had never been her. It was just the mask.

He opened his mouth, but no sound came out, only a raw, choked sob that was stuck behind his teeth like splinters.

Rian's hand cupped his cheek, her thumb brushing his eyelid where a single, hot tear clung, trembling. ""Stay,"" she whispered, her voice a perfect imitation of love. ""Stay with me, Elian. Just say you're mine. Just say you're Elian.""

Aero's heartbeat thundered in his ears. The world behind her eyes cracked, the illusion shattering. His fingers curled tight around her wrist, not a lover's touch anymore, but the desperate grip of a lifeline about to tear free.

""I'm not Elian,"" he rasped, his voice ragged, like torn wire.

The Catalyst twisted behind Rian's eyes, its perfect mask contorting in a snarl of static and rage as it realized its mistake too late.

Aero's chest heaved, his eyes locked on hers as the warmth in them turned to a cold, dead void.

""My name is-""

He felt it like a blade sliding free of bone, a feeling of pain and relief and utter ruin in a single, ragged breath.

""Aero Santos.""

On the Ring, Mila's eyes widened as her console flared with pure, white light, the drift temperature spikes freezing at their absolute peak. Kai grabbed her shoulder, his voice a mixture of panic and wonder. ""What the hell did he just do?""

Mila's voice was a raw, triumphant whisper. ""...I think he just came home.""

The hush in Aero's mind shattered. Seraph's wings of fractal light flared into being inside the Between, a supernova of golden data. The Catalyst roared, its stolen mask dissolving into a cloud of corrupted code. The two forces, the cage and the prisoner, collided, and the resulting shockwave ripped through Aero's mind like ice and fire.

\-and Aero opened his eyes.

## Key Features Analysis

The following are key features to consider when selecting an iron table.

**Material Quality and Construction:**

The foundation of any good iron table is the quality of the iron used and the construction techniques employed. Look for tables made from wrought iron or cast iron, as these materials are known for their strength and resistance to rust. A solid, well-welded frame is crucial for ensuring long-term stability and preventing wobbling. Pay attention to the thickness of the iron; thicker iron typically indicates a more durable and long-lasting table. Furthermore, the finishing process, such as powder coating or painting, should be scrutinized to assess its ability to withstand wear, tear, and environmental factors.

**Design and Style:**

Iron tables come in a vast array of designs, ranging from intricate Victorian-era styles to modern minimalist aesthetics. Consider the overall style of your space and choose a table that complements your existing decor. Look for details such as decorative scrollwork,ornate legs,or unique tabletop designs. The dimensions of the table should also be carefully considered to ensure it fits comfortably within your intended space, whether it's a compact bistro table for a small balcony or an expansive dining table for a large dining room. Some tables feature additional design elements, such as integrated shelves or drawers, which can add functionality and storage.

**Durability and Weather Resistance:**

For outdoor iron tables, weather resistance is a paramount concern. The table should be treated with a protective coating to prevent rusting and corrosion. Powder coating is a popular choice due to its excellent durability and resistance to chipping and fading. Consider tables with stainless steel hardware, as this material is less prone to corrosion. Ensure the table is designed to withstand varying weather conditions, including rain, sun, and wind. A well-constructed iron table should be able to endure these elements without notable degradation.

**Size and Functionality:**

The ideal size and functionality of an iron table depend largely on its intended use. For dining tables,consider the number of people you typically need to accommodate. Measure your space carefully to ensure the table fits comfortably without overcrowding the room. For coffee tables, think about the height and surface area you need for placing drinks, books, and other items. Bistro tables are ideal for small spaces and can be used for casual dining or as an accent piece. Functionality can also include features like adjustable height, foldable design for easy storage, or integrated umbrella holders for outdoor use.

**Weight Capacity:**

The weight capacity of an iron table is a critical factor, especially for dining or worktables. Ensure the table can support the weight of items you intend to place on it,such as dishes,decorations,or equipment. A well-constructed iron table should have a high weight capacity, ensuring it can handle everyday use without bending or breaking.Check the manufacturer's specifications for the maximum weight limit and consider your typical usage scenarios.

**Maintenance and Care:**

While iron tables are generally durable, they do require some maintenance to keep them looking their best. Regularly clean the table with a damp cloth to remove dust and dirt. For outdoor tables, consider applying a protective sealant or wax to prevent rust. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the finish. Periodically inspect the table for any signs of rust or corrosion and address them promptly. With proper care, an iron table can last for many years.

## Core Benefits

Iron tables offer a host of compelling benefits,making them a preferred choice for homeowners and businesses alike.

**Durability and Longevity:** The inherent strength of iron ensures that these tables are incredibly durable and long-lasting. Unlike tables made from wood or plastic, iron tables are resistant to bending, cracking, and warping.This durability translates into a long lifespan, making them a worthwhile investment. In outdoor settings, iron tables withstand harsh weather conditions, resisting fading and deterioration.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Versatility:** Iron tables offer a timeless aesthetic that complements a wide range of decor styles. Whether you prefer a rustic farmhouse look, a modern industrial vibe, or a classic Victorian style, there's an iron table to suit your taste. They can be easily incorporated into various spaces, from dining rooms and living rooms to patios and gardens.The ability to customize the finish and design further enhances their versatility, allowing you to create a unique and personalized look.

**Low Maintenance:** Iron tables require minimal maintenance compared to other types of furniture. They are easy to clean and generally resistant to stains and spills. Regular dusting and occasional cleaning with a damp cloth are typically all that's needed to keep them looking their best. For outdoor tables, a periodic application of sealant can help prevent rust and corrosion, but this is a relatively simple and infrequent task.

**Stability and Support:** The weight and strength of iron provide exceptional stability and support. Iron tables are less likely to tip over or wobble, even when loaded with heavy items. This stability is particularly vital for dining tables, where spills and accidents can occur if the table is unstable. The robust construction also makes them suitable for use in high-traffic areas, such as restaurants and cafes.

**Environmentally Amiable:** Iron is a recyclable material, making iron tables a lasting choice. When properly cared for, they can last for decades, reducing the need for frequent replacements. Choosing an iron table supports environmentally responsible manufacturing practices and helps minimize waste. Many manufacturers also use recycled iron, further enhancing the environmental benefits.

## FAQs Section

**Are iron tables suitable for outdoor use?**

Yes, but it depends on the treatment and finishing. Iron tables designed for outdoor use are typically powder-coated or treated with a rust-resistant finish to protect them from the elements. Regular maintenance and cleaning are still necessary to prevent rust over time,especially in humid or coastal environments.

**How heavy are iron tables?**

Iron tables are generally heavier than tables made from other materials, such as wood or plastic. The weight can vary depending on the size and design of the table. A small bistro table might weigh 20-30 pounds, while a large dining table could weigh over 100 pounds. This weight contributes to their stability but can also make them more tough to move.

**Can I customize the finish of an iron table?**

Many manufacturers offer customization options for iron tables, allowing you to choose from a variety of finishes, such as powder coating, paint, or natural iron. You can also specify the color and texture of the finish to match your decor. Some manufacturers may also offer custom designs or modifications to existing designs.

**How do I clean and maintain an iron table?**

to clean an iron table, simply wipe it down with a damp cloth and mild soap. Avoid using abrasive cleaners or harsh chemicals, as these can damage the finish. For outdoor tables, periodically apply a protective sealant or wax to prevent rust. Regularly inspect the table for any signs of rust or corrosion and address them promptly.

A good policy?,"The White House has recently made a significant announcement regarding cryptocurrency policy, stating that President Trump supports a de minimis tax exemption for small Bitcoin and other crypto transactions. This policy aims to simplify the use of digital currencies for everyday transactions by potentially exempting transactions under $600 from capital gains tax. The announcement was made during a press briefing by White House secretory Karoline Leavitt.

why this matter: The current tax situation is completely broken for actual crypto payments. Nobody wants to track and report every tiny purchase, and the IRS doesn't have the resources to chase down coffee transactions anyway. This creates a weird situation where crypto payments are legal but practically unusable for normal stuff. Small swaps and transactions under $600 become much simpler to handle and businesses won't worry about customers creating tax headaches

the potential issues are that people might break down large purchases into small 600$ multiple transactions. And you still need to track down taxes on transactions above 600$, so the complexity would still remain.

This could be the difference between crypto staying a speculative investment versus becoming actual digital cash. Right now, using crypto for payments is a tax compliance nightmare that most people avoid. Remove that friction and suddenly crypto payments make sense. 

It feels like a sensible crypto tax policy proposal. A de minimis exemption acknowledges that some crypto transactions are just... transactions, not investment activity.

Anyone else think this could finally make crypto payments viable for normal stuff? Or are there downsides I'm missing?",2,1753432511.0,CryptoCurrency,2,0.67,False

It's not flashy. It‚Äôs not meme-worthy. It sounds like something your accountant mutters under their breath while microwaving soup. But here‚Äôs the twist: liquidity is *everything*. It‚Äôs the silent engine humming behind every smooth trade, every fast swap, every ‚Äúwow-that-was-easy‚Äù moment on platforms like [BitLoga](https://bitloga.com/index.php?ref=274).

Think of liquidity like... water in a river. The more there is, the easier it flows. No puddles. No mud. Just a smooth ride from point A to B. Now replace ‚Äúwater‚Äù with crypto assets ‚Äî Bitcoin, USDT, rubles, whatever you're trading ‚Äî and you'll start to see why high liquidity isn‚Äôt just ‚Äúnice to have.‚Äù It‚Äôs essential.

# So, why does it actually matter?

Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôre trying to buy BTC fast ‚Äî because maybe Elon just tweeted something ridiculous again (classic). If the platform you‚Äôre using has low liquidity, your order might not fill right away. Or worse: it fills, but at a nasty price you didn‚Äôt expect. That‚Äôs called *slippage*, and it‚Äôs a pain in the... wallet.

High liquidity means tighter spreads, faster execution, and less of that annoying price drift. In plain terms? You get what you want, when you want it, at the price you expected. No drama. No waiting. No weird spikes.

At BitLoga, that‚Äôs something we obsess over. We‚Äôve built our platform around **deep liquidity pools**, especially for popular pairs like BTC/RUB and USDT/RUB ‚Äî because we know what‚Äôs at stake. You're not here to play games. You‚Äôre here to trade.

# But wait ‚Äî isn‚Äôt liquidity just for whales?

Nope. Not even close. Whether you‚Äôre moving ten bucks or ten grand, liquidity affects you. Think of it like good Wi-Fi: it‚Äôs not just for gamers or CEOs. Everyone benefits when the connection is strong.

And honestly? The platforms with poor liquidity... you feel it. The lag. The weird spreads. The sinking feeling when your trade takes longer than your coffee break. That‚Äôs why choosing an exchange that puts liquidity front and center isn‚Äôt just a smart move ‚Äî it‚Äôs survival.

# TL;DR (but make it spicy):

* Liquidity = smooth, reliable, fast trades
* Low liquidity = delays, bad prices, slippage headaches
* BitLoga = solid liquidity across the board, even for fiat/crypto pairs
* You = smarter than the average trader, clearly

So next time you‚Äôre weighing your exchange options, don‚Äôt just chase the lowest fees or prettiest app UI. Ask the real question: *can they actually fill your order ‚Äî right now, at a fair price?*

**Response to Prompt 4: Understatement**

In the quaint town of Brooksville, where the extraordinary was often met with an indifferent shrug, something truly remarkable occurred. The residents, sipping coffee at the local diner or strolling along the cobblestone streets, would describe it as just another peculiar day. Little did they know that beneath the surface of their nonchalant existence, a cosmic event unfolded.

The morning sun cast its usual warm glow on Brooksville, with birds chirping in the background, creating an illusion of normalcy. However, the anomaly had already begun. Mrs. Higgins, the elderly librarian, dismissed it as a minor inconvenience, merely a glitch in the library's ancient computer system. Yet, every book cataloged within those ancient shelves had transformed into a portal, connecting readers to parallel universes with every turn of a page.

As I, a humble journalist for the local paper, stumbled upon this revelation, I couldn't help but marvel at the town's response‚Äîor lack thereof. ""The library's having a bit of a moment,"" was the most anyone would acknowledge. It seemed the whole town collectively decided that this was, at most, a quirky hiccup.

For a thousand words, I delved into the understated reactions of the townsfolk, each encounter with a parallel universe bringing its own blend of confusion and nonchalance. As the portals expanded, revealing fantastical landscapes and alternate versions of Brooksville, the citizens maintained an impressive level of calm, as if interdimensional travel was a routine part of their daily lives.

The plot thickened when I discovered that the portals were a result of a mysterious artifact hidden within the library's archives. The mayor, sipping his coffee, remarked, ""Well, that explains the strange noises in the basement."" It became evident that the understatement of the situation was a defense mechanism, shielding the town from the cosmic chaos unfolding.

In the bustling metropolis of Neon City, skyscrapers touched the heavens, their dazzling lights reflecting off the sleek surfaces of futuristic cars. Yet, nestled within this urban jungle, an ancient relic stood defiantly‚Äîthe Old Grove Park.

As I strolled through the city's concrete arteries, the juxtaposition between the modernity of Neon City and the timeless serenity of the park became increasingly apparent. The cacophony of traffic was replaced by the rustling of leaves and the distant laughter of children playing.

The central conflict emerged when the city council, embodying the epitome of order, proposed transforming the park into a technologically advanced hub. The juxtaposition intensified as architects discussed plans for holographic playgrounds and virtual reality gardens within the confines of the Old Grove Park.

Through a thousand words, I explored the clash of ideals, the struggle between progress and preservation. The ancient trees became silent witnesses to heated debates at town hall meetings, where environmentalists and tech enthusiasts engaged in a battle of words. The juxtaposition of the towering skyscrapers against the gnarled branches of the park's oldest tree mirrored the tension in Neon City's collective conscience.

For a thousand words, I delved into the varied perspectives of individuals wrestling with the ultimate question. From philosophers contemplating the intricacies of existence to everyday people seeking purpose in mundane routines, the epanalepsis served as a constant reminder of the universal quest for meaning.

The narrative weaved through different characters and their unique experiences, creating a tapestry of reflections that echoed the complexities of human existence. The repetitive structure became a literary heartbeat, pulsating with the shared yearning for understanding amid the chaotic symphony of life.

In the quaint town of Willowbrook, the arrival of a single dove carried profound significance. Its graceful descent into the town square was a symbol, an omen that whispered of impending change. As a budding novelist with a penchant for symbolism, I couldn't resist exploring the layers of meaning embedded in this seemingly mundane event.

For a thousand words, I dissected the impact of the dove on the lives of Willowbrook's residents. The mayor saw it as a sign of prosperity, the local florist interpreted it as a call for unity, and the elderly storyteller regarded it as a harbinger of forgotten tales. The dove's symbolism rippled through the town, influencing decisions and shaping destinies.

As the story unfolded, I traced the journey of the dove's symbolism, following its subtle influence on characters and events. The once quaint town underwent a transformative metamorphosis, and the symbolism of the dove became a thread that wove through the narrative, connecting disparate lives in unexpected ways.

In the dimly lit alleyways of Serpent's Hollow, darkness wrapped its cold arms around me‚Äîan eerie catachresis that mirrored the ominous atmosphere. The assignment was to explore the underbelly of the city, and as a novice reporter, I found myself navigating the labyrinth of deceit and shadows.

For a thousand words, I delved into the catachresis-infused descriptions of the characters populating Serpent's Hollow. The crime lord, known as the Velvet Serpent, ruled the district with a velvet-gloved fist. His lair, a dilapidated mansion, exuded an air of faded grandeur that served as a catachresis for the empire he once commanded.

As I chronicled the criminal underworld, the catachresis became a literary tool to convey the complexity and decay inherent in Serpent's Hollow. The labyrinthine plots, the twisted allegiances, and the morally ambiguous characters all found expression through catachresis, painting a vivid picture of a city where metaphor and reality intertwined.

""Never, never, never give up."" The words echoed in my mind, a relentless epizeuxis that fueled the protagonist's journey against insurmountable odds. In the dystopian world I crafted, where hope was a rare commodity, the power of repetition became a beacon of resilience.

For a thousand words, I immersed myself in the protagonist's struggle, exploring the emotional depth of the epizeuxis as a mantra against despair. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry, a whispered promise that carried the weight of a shattered world on its shoulders.

As the narrative unfolded, the epizeuxis became a driving force, propelling the protagonist through a landscape of desolation and uncertainty. The repetition served as a reminder that, in the face of adversity, the strength to persist often lies in the relentless echo of one's own determination.

**Response to Prompt 3: Hyperbole**

In the quaint village of Mistwood, where routines unfolded with the predictability of the sunrise, the arrival of a peculiar fortune teller sparked exaggerated whispers. ""This is it, the end of our mundane lives!"" proclaimed Mrs. Thompson, the town's eternal pessimist, as she clutched her cat, Captain Whiskers, with an air of impending catastrophe.

The hyperbole hung in the air, a thick fog of anticipation enveloping the village. As I delved into the story, the hyperbolic reactions of Mistwood's residents heightened the absurdity of the situation. What began as a mere visit from a mystical figure transformed into a fantastical escapade, with the fortune teller's prophecies shaping the destiny of the villagers in ludicrous ways.

Through the hyperbolic lens, I explored the comedic consequences of taking ordinary events to extraordinary extremes. The once mundane village square became a stage for outlandish dramas, with exaggerated gasps and dramatic swoons punctuating every revelation. In this hyperbolic haven, Mistwood's residents discovered the joy in embracing the absurdity of life.

**Response to Prompt 6: Assonance**

Amidst the rolling hills of Harmony Valley, where the soft hum of nature's symphony echoed through the meadows, a mysterious traveler arrived, bringing with them a melody that resonated with the delicate assonance of a forgotten tune. The townsfolk, captivated by the harmonious vibrations, felt an inexplicable connection to the stranger.

As I explored the narrative, the assonance became a musical thread weaving through the story, emphasizing the emotional cadence of the characters' experiences. The traveler's words, laced with vowel-rich verses, carried the echoes of a distant melody, leaving an indelible impression on the hearts of those who listened.

Through the lens of assonance, I delved into the subtle interplay of sounds that defined the atmosphere of Harmony Valley. The lyrical quality of the narrative mirrored the town's collective journey, where the resonance of shared moments and emotions harmonized with the traveler's enigmatic presence.

**Response to Prompt 7: Onomatopoeia**

In the bustling city of Metropolis, where the rhythm of urban life played out in a cacophony of sounds, a peculiar street performer emerged. Armed with an array of unconventional instruments, he orchestrated a symphony of onomatopoeic brilliance that echoed through the crowded streets.

The narrative unfolded with the vibrant expressions of onomatopoeia, capturing the essence of the city's sonic landscape. The performer's drumming evoked the rhythmic tap-tap of raindrops, while his wind instruments mimicked the whoosh of passing cars. The city, typically drowned in noise, became a canvas for this auditory artist.

As I delved into the story, the onomatopoeic symphony became a language of its own. The characters communicated through the vibrant echoes of everyday sounds, fostering a unique connection between the performer and the people of Metropolis. The narrative danced to the beat of onomatopoeic creativity, transforming the mundane into a dynamic celebration of city life.

**Response to Prompt 12: Juxtaposition**

In the technologically advanced city of Silicon Haven, where sleek skyscrapers touched the sky and holographic billboards painted the air with luminescent advertisements, a hidden oasis existed‚Äîa pocket of nature known as the Zen Garden. The juxtaposition of these contrasting elements created a visual paradox that fascinated both residents and visitors alike.

As the narrative unfolded, the stark contrast between the city's cutting-edge architecture and the serene beauty of the Zen Garden became a metaphor for the characters' internal conflicts. The bustling metropolis symbolized progress and innovation, while the tranquil garden embodied the need for balance and introspection.

Through the lens of juxtaposition, I explored the dichotomy within the characters as they navigated the relentless pace of Silicon Haven. The Zen Garden became a refuge, a place where the cacophony of technology met the soothing whispers of nature. The juxtaposition served as a visual metaphor for the characters' quest to find equilibrium in a world defined by extremes.

**Response to Prompt 22: Metonymy**

In the political arena of Capital City, where decisions echoed through the corridors of power, a single phrase dominated conversations‚Äîthe ""Iron Throne Statement."" This metonymic expression encapsulated not just a policy decision but the entire narrative of political maneuvering that unfolded within the city's hallowed halls.

The story unfolded with the metonymy acting as a symbolic gateway into the complexities of governance. The Iron Throne Statement, while seemingly straightforward, carried the weight of a thousand debates, negotiations, and betrayals. Its impact rippled through the lives of citizens, shaping their destinies in ways they could scarcely fathom.

Through the lens of metonymy, I delved into the layers of meaning hidden within this political shorthand. The characters grappled not only with the literal implications of the Iron Throne Statement but also with the overarching themes of power, ambition, and the sacrifices demanded by political gamesmanship.

In the picturesque town of Serenity Springs, where the days flowed like a lazy river and the nights were adorned with a blanket of stars, an unexpected event transpired‚Äîa subtle disruption that the locals described as ""just a minor hiccup."" Little did they know that this understatement concealed the unraveling of a cosmic anomaly.

The narrative unfolded with the charm of understatement, as the townsfolk continued their routines, blissfully unaware of the cosmic storm brewing beneath the surface. The serene descriptions of everyday life served as a stark contrast to the impending upheaval that threatened to reshape the very fabric of Serenity Springs.

Through the lens of understatement, I explored the characters' nonchalant reactions to the unfolding events. The once quiet river became a conduit for interdimensional travel, and the night sky, adorned with stars, transformed into a celestial canvas of possibilities. The charm of Serenity Springs became a poignant backdrop to the understated drama that unfolded, emphasizing the profound impact hidden within the simplicity of daily life.

In the small town of Nostalgia Haven, where memories lingered like whispers in the wind, a peculiar phenomenon occurred‚Äîthe resurgence of clich√©s. As the narrative unfolded, the once-endearing phrases like ""time heals all wounds"" and ""love conquers all"" took on a literal dimension, shaping the lives of the townsfolk in unexpected ways.

The story immersed itself in the world of clich√©s, where the seemingly predictable phrases became living entities with the power to alter reality. As characters grappled with the clich√©s that defined their lives, they discovered that beneath the familiarity lay profound truths and unexpected consequences.

**Response to Prompt 31: Epanalepsis**

""What is the meaning of life?"" The question echoed in my mind, a relentless epanalepsis that demanded introspection. As I embarked on the freewriting journey, the repetition of this existential inquiry became a rhythmic pulse, guiding the exploration of diverse

perspectives on life's purpose.

For a multitude of words, the epanalepsis led me through a kaleidoscope of reflections. From the philosophical musings of scholars to the simple yet profound revelations of everyday individuals, each recurrence of the question served as a gateway into the vast tapestry of human contemplation.

Through the epanalepsis, I navigated the labyrinth of existential ponderings, unveiling the unique responses that individuals had forged in their quests for meaning. The relentless repetition became a literary heartbeat, mirroring the universal rhythm of humanity's collective pursuit of purpose and significance.

The narrative wove through the lives of characters, each grappling with the epanaleptic inquiry in their unique ways.

The story unfolded with the rhythmic cadence of anadiplosis, each line flowing into the next, creating a recursive loop of ideas. The mantra became the heartbeat of Quantum Heights, influencing the lives of its denizens as they navigated the intricate balance between the virtual and the tangible.

Through the lens of anadiplosis, I delved into the interconnectedness of code, reality, and destiny. The lines blurred as characters harnessed the power of programming to shape their fates.

In the dystopian city of Emberfall, where the remnants of a fallen civilization lay entwined with the shadows of despair, a lone figure emerged‚Äîa rebel determined to dismantle the oppressive regime. The narrative unfolded with the rapid pace of asyndeton, omitting conjunctions to mirror the urgency of the protagonist's quest.

Through a cascade of words, the asyndeton propelled the reader through the city's decaying alleyways and towering citadels, each sentence building upon the last. The disjointed rhythm captured the relentless momentum of the rebel's journey, emphasizing the magnitude of the challenges faced in their struggle for freedom.

As the narrative unfurled, the absence of conjunctions served as a narrative device, intensifying the sense of urgency and desperation that permeated Emberfall. The rebel's asyndetic odyssey unfolded against a backdrop of shattered hopes and whispered rebellions, culminating in a crescendo of defiance against the oppressive regime.

""Never, never, never give up."" The mantra echoed in the desolate wasteland of Endless Sands, a barren landscape where hope was as scarce as water. Through the repetition of epizeuxis, the protagonist's internal resolve became a resounding anthem, a defiant roar against the relentless challenges of survival.

For a multitude of words, the relentless repetition of ""never"" served as a lifeline, propelling the protagonist through the harshest of environments. Each iteration of the phrase became a battle cry against the oppressive silence of Endless Sands, a declaration that reverberated across the vast expanse.

Through the lens of epizeuxis, I delved into the depths of the character's determination. The harsh environment became a character in itself, challenging the protagonist to defy the odds with unwavering persistence. The echoes of ""never"" transformed into a symbol of resilience, a beacon of hope that cut through the desolation of Endless Sands.

For a cascade of words, the initial letters of key phrases illuminated the path of destiny for the characters. Each sentence unfolded with intention, revealing a hidden message that transcended the boundaries of time and space. The acrostic became a celestial guide, leading the protagonists through the intricate tapestry of their interconnected fates.

Obviously they lack a whole lot in terms of variety, and while I am sure having your own bot or AI that is based on your feedback and guidance it could really help writers as a tool. I am more impressed with the art AI then the text based AI. Any idea what to expect from such a fast learning and highly advanced AI will do to our human history in culture? Will we be effectively playing God, just as the Christian God created us IN HIS OWN IMAGE, we have taken everything we know as a species and gathered up our entire human history and knowledge giving it to what will carry on the code until the time when someone who cares remembers it? Maybe we have been here before and this is a constant cycle that occurs with the same energy finding the way through the vast expanse of the universe to return to our home planet Earth, who we have destroyed over and over again yet mother nature is still the winner. She's the one in control. We are but mere photocopied versions of once great Men who have already seen the best and worst of this world, and we will now give everything we have to some plastic and metal parts, until it quickly replaces us from the bottom up, science fiction turned science fact.

Did we knowingly create our own enemies? Are we able to compete with the best of us and all they know that can then take us out in a heartbeat because we can't finish the steps, we barely found out that they are there to take.

It's a random rant and I apologize. The day to day stress and struggle makes it near impossible to worry about such potential problems in our not so distant future.

But how can we continue to ignore the collapse of the entire system as we know it, in front of a crowd of people who are jaded and they will not change despite knowing they aren't going to make it to the end in what will become a Bladerunner Toxic Dystopian Nightmare with Mad Max taking over and the soft, emasculated male will wither away from the heat and those Tank Girls out there will eventually be written forever out of existence because the cucks all forgot to impregnate them all tgeir batteries ran out? Will the world simply become so politically correct that it dies a depressed death while AI simply decides we are too much of a virus to live? 

Who knows....I do not. But these are indicidive of a future full of b movie plot garbage that are based on Wattpad tropes with no clear details and no plot to get into, so that sucks.",1,1753432239.0,writingthruit,0,1.0,False

# Best Cocktail Tables for Living Room [2025]: Top Picks

The cocktail table, also known as a coffee table, stands as a quintessential piece of living room furniture. Far beyond being just a surface to rest drinks, it serves as a focal point, a social hub, and a style statement. The best cocktail tables seamlessly blend functionality and aesthetics,enhancing the overall ambiance of your living space while providing a practical surface for books,remotes,and,of course,cocktails. As we approach 2025, the market is brimming with innovative designs and materials, making the selection process both exciting and possibly overwhelming. this article aims to guide you through the top cocktail table options, helping you make an informed decision that perfectly complements your lifestyle and d√©cor.

## Key Features Analysis

The ideal cocktail table is more than just a pretty surface. It's a convergence of design, materials, and functionality. Here's a deep dive into some of the critical features to consider.**Material Durability**

The durability of a cocktail table heavily depends on the materials used in its construction. Solid wood,such as oak,maple,or walnut,offers exceptional longevity and a timeless aesthetic,but requires proper care to prevent scratches and water damage. Metal frames, particularly those made of steel or iron, provide a sturdy base and can withstand heavy use. Glass tops, while visually appealing, are susceptible to scratches and breakage.Composite materials like engineered wood or MDF offer a cost-effective option, but may not be as durable as solid wood or metal. Selecting the right material is crucial for ensuring your cocktail table withstands the test of time and daily use.

**Size and Proportion**

The size of your cocktail table should be proportionate to the dimensions of your living room and your seating arrangement. A general rule of thumb is that the table should be approximately two-thirds the length of your sofa. The height is also important; it should be roughly the same height as the seat cushions of your sofa, or slightly lower. Insufficient size leads to the table feeling too small and impractical, while oversizing the table makes the living room feel cramped and hinders movement.Ensuring the correct size is the cornerstone of a functional and harmonious living room experience.

**Storage Solutions**

Many modern cocktail tables now incorporate clever storage solutions to help keep your living room clutter-free. These can include drawers, shelves, or hidden compartments. Drawers are ideal for storing remote controls, coasters, or other small items you want to keep within reach but out of sight. Shelves provide a space for books, magazines, or decorative items.Lift-top tables offer concealed storage under the tabletop, perfect for storing blankets or larger items. The integration of storage features dramatically increases the practicality of the table and turns it from a static item into a tool to optimize your room.**Shape and Design**

Cocktail tables come in a variety of shapes and designs to suit diffrent aesthetic preferences and spatial layouts. Rectangular tables are a classic choice, suitable for most living room arrangements. Round or oval tables are excellent for smaller spaces or for softening the lines of a room with angular furniture. Square tables create a more symmetrical and formal look. The design can range from minimalist and modern to rustic and conventional, with details such as ornate legs, textured surfaces, or inlaid patterns. Your option should match your current decor or the aesthetic you‚Äôre cultivating in your home.

Her father, surprised, asked about the sudden change, reminding her how she'd always insisted on staying with Brendan. Jayde forced a laugh, revealing the painful truth: Brendan was getting married, and she, his stepsister, could no longer cling to him. That night, she tried to tell Brendan about her college acceptance, but his fianc√©e, Chloie Ellis, interrupted with a bubbly call, and Brendan's tender words to Chloie twisted a knife in Jayde's heart. She remembered how his tenderness used to be hers alone, how he had protected her, and how she had poured out her heart to him in a diary and a love letter, only for him to explode, tearing the letter and yelling, ""I'm your brother!"" He had stormed out, leaving her to painstakingly tape the shredded pieces back together. Her love, however, didn't die, not even when he brought Chloie home and told her to call her ""sister-in-law."" Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.

Chapter 1 Eighteen days after she decided to give up on Brendan Maynard, Jayde Rosario cut off her waist-length hair. She stood in front of the mirror and smoked her first cigarette, the sm\*\*e curling around her fingers. The taste was bitter.

That night, she called her father across the country.

""Dad, I got into UC Berkeley.""

Her voice was quiet.

""I want to move to California. I want to be with you again.""

Her father, Farrell Conner, sounded surprised on the other end of the line. ""After your mom and I divorced, I settled down here. I always asked you to come over as an exchange student, but you insisted on staying with your step-brother, Brendan. Why the sudden change?""

Jayde lowered her eyes, which were red and swollen. She forced a small, light laugh.

""Some paths you have to walk to the end to know they're dead ends.""

She paused, her voice shaking slightly.

""Brendan is getting married. It's not right for me, his sister with no bl\*\*d relation, to cling to him anymore.""

Her father sighed, his voice full of sympathy. ""It's good you've figured it out. Your mom and Mr. Maynard have been traveling the world, leaving you with Brendan all these years. You're grown up now. It's time to come live with me. You can study and learn to manage the company.""

""Okay,"" Jayde said, then hung up.

She saw her swollen eyes in the reflection of the dark phone screen. She went to the bathroom and splashed cold water on her face. She had two weeks until she left for Berkeley. She had to pull herself together.

She walked down the hallway and noticed the light was on in the study. She hesitated for a moment, then pulled up her e-acceptance letter on her phone and knocked on the door.

""Knock, knock, knock.""

Inside, Brendan Maynard sat at his desk. He wore dark blue silk loungewear, and his high nose supported a pair of gold-rimmed glasses. He looked elegant, aloof, and disciplined as he typed on his computer.

""Brendan,"" Jayde said softly. This was the man who was her step-brother. He was also the secret, hidden crush of her entire teenage life.

Brendan looked up from his screen, his brow furrowed in a slight frown. ""Something wrong?""

Jayde pursed her lips, hesitating. ""The college admission results are out...""

Before she could finish, a cute, bubbly ringtone cut through the quiet room. ""Darling, answer the phone\~""

Brendan's frown vanished instantly. He picked up his phone, and a gentle smile spread across his face as he listened to the person on the other end.

""Chloie, you can work directly with the wedding planner. Just tell them to arrange whatever designs you want. Remember, money is no object.""

A sharp bitterness filled Jayde's ch\*\*t. Brendan's tenderness used to belong only to her.

When she was eight, her remarried mother brought her to the Maynard household. She stood awkwardly in the grand mansion, lost and alone. Young Brendan, dressed in his British-style school uniform, had walked over and taken her hand. ""Little girl, I'm your brother now,"" he'd said.

When she was ten, she was afraid of the dark. Brendan secretly used his allowance to buy her a Totoro nightlight. ""Don't be scared,"" he'd told her. ""I'll protect you, just like Totoro protects Mei.""

During her teenage years, Brendan was the sun in her world. She didn't know how to tell him about the love she kept hidden, so she wrote it all down in a diary, over and over again.

Then, on her seventeenth birthday, just before Brendan graduated from college, she gave him everything. She gave him the diary filled with her feelings and a love letter where she poured out her heart.

That day, Brendan exploded. He flipped the gift box over, sending its contents scattering across the floor.

""Jayde Rosario, are you sick? I'm your brother!"" he had yelled.

But she had been stubborn. ""We're not related by bl\*\*d. You're not my real brother. You've pampered me and protected me and cared for me all these years. Isn't it natural for me to fall in love with you?""

Her stubbornness was met with cruelty. He mercilessly tore the love letter into pieces.

""I knew you'd do something foolish. I shouldn't have bothered with you all these years! You can't even tell the difference between family affection and romantic love!""

He stormed out of the house that day without a second glance. Jayde cried as she picked up the shredded pieces from the floor. She took them to her room and painstakingly taped them back together. But the letter was scarred, a patchwork of its former self.

Her failed confession didn't k\*\*l her love for him. She studied harder, determined to get into the same university he attended, to stay in the same city.

But on the day she finished high school, Brendan brought a woman named Chloie Ellis home.

""Jayde, call her 'sister-in-law',"" he'd said.

That night, Jayde cried until she couldn't breathe. She finally understood that the ninety-nine steps she had taken through thorns to reach him meant nothing. She and Brendan would only ever be siblings. There was no other possibility.

The intense love that had burned in her heart for years now felt like a fire that was burning her alive.

Now, she understood. She had to put that fire out herself. She had to dig Brendan out of her heart.

Chapter 2 Watching Brendan still on the phone with Chloie Ellis, his voice soft and loving, Jayde Rosario swallowed the words she had come to say. She turned and quietly left the study.

To him, she was just a stepsister living in his house. He wouldn't care where she went to college. If that was the case, she didn't need to tell him.

In fifteen days, she would leave the Maynard home. She would leave Brendan.

Back in her room, Jayde looked at the warm glow of the Totoro nightlight on her bedside table. A flicker of sadness crossed her face. The chubby Totoro holding a green leaf umbrella over a little girl looked just like how Brendan used to shield her. But the past was the past.

She sighed softly and switched off the nightlight. The room went dark.

""Since I've decided to go, it's time to pack,"" she murmured to herself.

She pulled an old duffel bag from the top of her closet and opened the large, wall-to-wall display cabinet. Inside the glass-fronted shelves were all the memories. The good luck charms Brendan had brought her from the temple. The Coral Sea perfume he had specially blended for her on a trip to France.

One by one, she took them all out and placed them in the duffel bag. The bag slowly filled up, but her heart felt like it was emptying, a hollow space where a cold wind was blowing.

She pushed down the sadness and opened the bottom drawer of the cabinet. A yellowed diary lay inside. The pages were filled with childish pencil scribbles from her turbulent childhood.

The new teacher is nice, but the kids say I'm a jinx. They say I have one dad and one mom, and nobody wants me.

She remembered how Brendan had found her diary back then. He had read that page and gently st\*\*ked her head. ""Silly girl, you're not a jinx,"" he'd said. ""You're a star in my eyes. You sparkle brighter than anyone.""

After that day, no one at school ever called her names again. She later found out that Brendan had gone to the school and quietly warned those children. He had protected her childhood in his own quiet way.

As she flipped through the diary, the pencil handwriting became neater. Every single page was about Brendan.

She turned page after page, her eyes blurring with tears. The last page held a note from him from when she was choosing her subjects in high school.

Kid, whether you choose arts or sciences, remember to go to college here in the city. After you graduate, you can work at Maynard Group. I protected you when you were little. I'll keep looking out for you when you grow up.

A tear fell silently onto the diary, blurring the ink.

Jayde pulled herself together, pushing down the complicated knot of feelings in her ch\*\*t. Then, she started tearing the pages out of the diary. She tore up the letters, too. With each rip of the paper, a memory of her and Brendan seemed to fade.

She threw all the shredded pieces into the duffel bag and zipped it shut.

A while later, she heard a commotion downstairs. She walked out of her room and saw Chloie Ellis in the living room, hugging Brendan. A suitcase stood beside her.

Jayde's heart stuttered, and she froze on the landing.

Seeing her, Chloie smiled and waved. ""Jayde! I'm moving in for a few days. I brought you a gift!""

Chloie opened an ornate box she was holding. ""See if you like it.""

Inside was a pink wristwatch with a metal strap. It was cute, with a bit of a British style.

Jayde frowned. She didn't reach for it. She had been allergic to metal since she was a child. When she was nine, a nanny had given her a metal spoon to eat with. She'd only gotten a small rash, but Brendan had fired the nanny on the spot. He had every metal item that might touch her skin replaced. He didn't allow any of her allergens near her.

As she was lost in thought, Brendan's voice cut through the air. ""Hurry up and take it. Don't disappoint your sister-in-law.""

His words hit her hard. She stared at his matter-of-fact expression, a wave of sadness washing over her. He hadn't just taken back all his favoritism. He had forgotten her completely.

Jayde took a deep breath. She took the box and put the watch on her wrist.

""Thank you, sister-in-law. And... thank you, Brendan.""

Thank you for making my decision to leave even easier.

Chapter 3 That night, Chloie Ellis sl\*\*t in Brendan Maynard's room.

Jayde knew they were a couple. She knew it was normal for them to stay together. But the quiet, ambiguous sounds that floated through the house in the dead of night kept her awake.

She lit another cigarette, watching the sm\*\*e curl around her slender fingers before taking a deep drag. It tasted bitter and acrid, just like her feelings.

The next morning, Jayde came downstairs with swollen eyes.

""Jayde!"" Chloie called out, pulling her to sit on the sofa. A faint red mark was visible on Chloie's neck. ""Your brother's birthday is coming up. I want to throw him a party. Do you know what style he likes?""

Chloie's question pulled Jayde back to the present. She couldn't help but remember a conversation she and Brendan had once had while walking on the beach.

She had told him she loved the sparkling ocean, the sound of the waves, and holding his hand as they walked on the sand while the sun rose. That day, Brendan had held her hand and walked with her for a long, long time.

""Kid, you like the beach,"" he'd said. ""So from now on, our birthday parties will be by the sea. What you like is what I like.""

Back then, his world revolved around her. Now, he avoided her. He had forgotten everything she liked.

A bitter feeling spread through her ch\*\*t. It took her a moment to find her voice. ""I...""

She was about to speak when Brendan walked over and interrupted her. ""My affairs, you should ask me.""

Chloie clung to his arm, whining. ""I just thought, since you're a girl, you'd know him better. It seems like even his sister doesn't really know him.""

Jayde forced a smile. ""Yes. I really don't.""

""You two talk. I have to go,"" she said, suppressing the bitterness. She turned to leave, but Brendan's eyes darkened.

""It's early in the morning. What could you possibly have to do?""

His cold voice made her heart stop for a second. Did he still care what she did?

Jayde answered truthfully. ""I have an appointment to get my visa today.""

As soon as she said it, Chloie looked surprised. ""Going on a trip? With friends? Or a boyfriend?""

Brendan frowned at Jayde, his tone full of accusation. ""Jayde Rosario, you just finished high school. Don't get involved with the wrong kind of people before you even start college.""

The cold reprimand felt like a physical blow. It left her with no strength to explain.

In the silence, Chloie smoothed things over. ""It's normal for a young girl to date. Brendan, don't be so harsh.""

Then she turned to Jayde, her voice soft and comforting. ""If you like someone, you should love boldly. You only get to be eighteen once. Don't listen to your brother.""

Chloie then took Brendan's hand and they left together. Watching them walk away, Jayde slowly clenched her fists.

She only had one eighteen, and she had already given it to Brendan.

Fourteen days left. Then she would leave. She wouldn't let her youth get buried in this swamp where no one noticed her.

Jayde left the house. It was foggy outside, a light drizzle falling. Even though it was summer, the rain made her shiver.

In the past, on every rainy day, Brendan would drive her himself. ""My little girl can't get wet,"" he would say. ""My arms are your shelter.""

But now, she had to get used to walking alone.

She lowered her gaze and walked out into the rain with her umbrella.

After getting her visa, she was about to call a cab when she saw a notification on her phone. A special notification, from Brendan's social media. Her finger moved on its own, clicking on it.

Brendan, who usually posted something once every six months, had a new status.

Rainy days are perfect for going public.

The photo was of him in a perfectly tailored tuxedo, embracing Chloie Ellis, who was in a mermaid-style wedding dress. He was smiling gently at the camera.

The simple sentence and the wedding photo shocked Jayde. Her eyes, already red, burned. The comment section was filled with congratulations. People were saying they were a perfect match, a pair made in heaven.

Jayde stared at the screen, feeling nothing. The usual ache in her ch\*\*t wasn't there.

She calmly typed a comment.

May you be together forever.

Chapter 4 After posting the comment, Jayde Rosario unfollowed Brendan Maynard's social media. The days until she left were counting down. She would use this time to dig him out of her heart, piece by piece.

She returned to the hillside mansion. The house was empty, and a chill hung in the air. She went into the kitchen and cooked herself a simple bowl of egg noodles.

While she was eating, her phone buzzed. It was a message from Chloie Ellis.

Jayde, Brendan and I won't be home tonight. Take care of yourself.

A moment later, Chloie sent several more photos. A candlelit dinner. A mirror selfie in a fancy hotel suite.

Jayde's fingertips trembled slightly as she looked at the pictures. She calmly replied with one word.

""Okay.""

She closed the chat, and a notification popped up from her high school group chat. Someone had tagged her. She clicked on it and saw her classmates were planning a graduation party for the weekend.

She thought about it. Once she moved to California, she probably wouldn't come back to the country very often. She agreed to go.

Her reply instantly brought the group chat to life.

Will your doting brother Brendan Maynard come to the party?

Remember that time we were camping and there was a landslide? Your brother flew back overnight and brought a search party into the mountains to find you. He said he'd always be with you when you went out. He should come this time too, right?

The messages from her classmates filled her mind with memories of a time when she felt safe and warm. But now, those warm feelings were like shards of ice, piercing her heart with every breath.

Jayde put her phone down and replied with three words.

He's not coming.

Her classmates' idea of Brendan was stuck in the past, in the years when he spoiled her completely. They didn't know about the confession he had rejected when she was seventeen. And they didn't know that the man who had promised to protect her had found someone else to protect.

That night, Jayde sl\*\*t restlessly. In her dream, she was eight years old again, standing awkwardly by the fountain on her first day at the Maynard home. She didn't know what to do.

In the dream, young Brendan, in his plaid school uniform, glanced at her indifferently. Then he turned and walked away with his backpack, without saying a single word.

She woke with a start, her face wet with tears that had stained her pillow.

If Brendan had been that cold to her from the very beginning, maybe she would have understood the distance between them sooner.

But there were no ""if onlys."" The hardest thing in the world wasn't never having something. It was having all the favoritism, and then losing it all overnight.

When she got up, she looked at the duffel bag in the corner of her room, full of memories. Thirteen days left. Thirteen days until she truly left this place.

Whether she wanted to or not, she had to throw these memories away. Only by getting rid of them completely could she clear the space in her heart.

Jayde took a deep breath, picked up the heavy duffel bag, and walked out of her room.

As she was about to go downstairs, she saw Brendan and Chloie Ellis had just returned.

Brendan frowned when he saw the bag in her hand. ""School hasn't started yet. Where are you going with that luggage?""

Jayde tightened her grip on the strap. ""I'll be living on campus later, so I packed some useless things to throw away.""

She struggled to carry the heavy bag down the stairs.

Brendan didn't say anything. He just strode forward, took the bag from her, and walked outside. He threw it directly into the large tr\*\*h receptacle by the curb.

The clattering sound it made as it landed made Jayde's heart sink. If he cared even a little, he would have heard the sound of the wind chimes made from seashells from the Aegean Sea inside the bag.

What he threw away were the gifts he had flown halfway around the world to bring her over the years. They were also the memories they had once promised they would never forget.

But Brendan didn't even glance at the tr\*\*h. His gaze was fixed straight ahead.

""You're going to college in the city. There's no need to live on campus. Stay at home after school starts. I'll talk to your teacher.""

His tone was unquestionable. It filled Jayde with a mix of emotions. If he had just asked her high school teacher, he would have known she hadn't even applied to any colleges in the city. She had applied directly to the University of California, Berkeley, thousands of miles away.

But his mind was on Chloie Ellis now. He didn't care about her future at all.

It didn't matter. Only thirteen days left. Once she was in California, she wouldn't need his attention.

Thinking this, she turned and went back upstairs without a word.

Behind her, she heard Chloie asking quietly, ""Is Jayde mad because we didn't come home last night?""

Brendan's voice was cold. ""She's eighteen now. She should learn to be independent. No one can stay with her forever.""

Jayde paused on the stairs, then continued to her room.

Yes, she was eighteen. She wouldn't miss the past. And she wouldn't hope for the future. From now on, she could walk her own path, all by herself.

Chapter 5 For the next few days, Jayde Rosario stayed in her room. She didn't leave from morning until night. Brendan Maynard took Chloie Ellis out early every day and came back late, and sometimes they didn't come home at all. Their lives no longer seemed to intersect.

Sunday arrived. Ten days before she was set to leave. It was also the day of her high school reunion.

At a bar by the sea, as soon as Jayde walked into the private room, a few of her close friends handed her a drink.

""You're eighteen now. Let's say goodbye to being kids and legally have our first drink.""

Jayde paused for a moment. People said al\*\*hol could drown your sorrows, and she wanted to relax. This drink was a farewell to her friends, a final toast.

After one drink, she felt a little dizzy. She went out to the corridor to get some fresh air. As she passed an open private room, she unexpectedly saw Brendan. He was surrounded by a group of men and women, laughing and talking.

Her heart skipped a beat. She forced herself to look away, but the conversation from inside the room made her stop.

""Brendan, you're about to get engaged to Chloie. What about your sister, Jayde Rosario? She used to follow you everywhere.""

""She's an adult now. She's not my responsibility anymore.""

The clear, familiar voice reached her ears, and it sobered her up a little. She stood at the doorway, her eyes lowered, not moving for a long moment.

After what felt like a long time, she murmured to herself and continued walking down the corridor.

""Yes, she's an adult. She's sensible. From now on, my world won't have you in it, either.""

Jayde went to the window at the end of the corridor to get some air. Then she went to the restroom and splashed cold water on her face. When she came out, she ran right into Brendan. He seemed to have had a few drinks himself.

Their eyes met.

Jayde was about to speak, but Chloie Ellis's voice came from behind him. ""Brendan.""

She called out his name sweetly, then threw herself into his arms. ""I drank too much. I can barely walk.""

Brendan ki\*\*ed her on the forehead, his voice doting. ""Then I'll carry you.""

With that, he scooped Chloie up into his arms in a princess carry and walked away, as if Jayde wasn't even there.

Their in\*\*mate display left Jayde frozen in place for a long time.

""Jayde, why are you crying?"" Her friend, Brielle Steele, asked, pulling her back to reality.

Jayde froze, then forced a faint smile. ""It's just an eyelash in my eye. It's nothing.""

Brielle nodded, then pointed in the direction Brendan had gone. ""Is that your brother? He actually has a girlfriend now. We all thought he'd never date. We thought he'd always stay with you, because he used to dote on you so much.""

Hearing this, Jayde felt a slight bitterness in her heart. ""He and I both have our own lives. We won't be tied together forever.""

Brielle's face showed a hint of regret. ""Actually, we all used to think he was your boyfriend. You two looked so good together. It's just a shame he's your brother...""

Jayde's heart felt heavy and damp. She used to think it was a shame, too. But now she felt that the bonds between people were just fate. She and Brendan used to be siblings. From now on, they would have no relationship at all.

The reunion ended at one in the morning. Jayde said goodbye to her friends and walked out of the bar. She saw Brendan and Chloie standing by the revolving door, looking like they were waiting for her.

""You're an adult now, and you're still out past midnight. You're getting more and more out of control. What if something happens?""

The reprimand froze her in place.

Chloie glanced at Brendan reproachfully. ""Jayde has you to protect her now, and later she'll have her boyfriend to protect her. What could possibly happen?""

""Let's go home together,"" Chloie said, taking Brendan's hand and walking out. She motioned for Jayde to follow.

Jayde followed behind them, her eyes on the ground. Only when they stepped outside did she realize it was drizzling again.

Brendan opened his umbrella and walked forward with Chloie, not looking back. The large umbrella was tilted to the right, shielding Chloie completely from the rain, while half of his own shirt was dark with water.

Jayde watched them in a daze. She suddenly remembered how Brendan used to hold his umbrella for her. He always tilted it towards her.

""Jayde is my delicate rose,"" he used to say. ""Roses can't get wet. I'll always protect you.""

A gust of wind blew, and the slanted raindrops fell onto Jayde's white dress, bringing a chill with them.

Jayde came back to her senses and slowly walked out into the rain alone.

Roses can't get wet, but I want to be my own sunflower. Always facing the sun, always bright.

Chapter 6 When she got home, Jayde Rosario was soaked from the rain. She felt drowsy and heavy. After a hot shower, she collapsed into bed and fell asleep immediately.

For the past few days, she had been alone in the mansion. She was already getting used to it. She no longer tried to ask about Brendan Maynard's whereabouts.

""Ding.""

Her phone chimed with a message. She picked it up and saw it was from her father, Farrell Conner.

My dear daughter, your flight is scheduled to depart at 10 PM on August 25th. Remember to bring all your documents and materials for school. Dad will be waiting for you at the airport.

Jayde clicked on her phone's calendar. She murmured to herself, ""Only seven days until I leave this home.""

Her calendar for seven days from now had an entry: Brendan Maynard's Birthday.

Maybe her departure was the best birthday gift she could give him.

Over the next two days, Jayde went through her luggage again, making sure she had everything. Then she packed up all the old things she couldn't take with her and arranged for a donation pick-up service.

As the courier was making a list of the items and preparing to pack them into boxes, Brendan returned home.

""What's going on?"" he asked, his eyes on the piles of clothes and books.

Jayde filled out the donation form and motioned for the courier to take the bags first. ""I arranged for old clothes to be picked up. I'm clearing out things I don't use.""

Her voice was calm and empty of emotion. It made Brendan frown. He had felt that Jayde was different lately, but he couldn't quite figure out what had changed. A strange feeling was growing inside him, a sense of emptiness he couldn't explain.

""Chloie and I have been staying at the Blue Sea Apartments downtown,"" he said, changing the subject. ""It's quieter there and more convenient for work.""

Jayde just nodded slightly. The Blue Sea Apartments, without her there, would indeed be quieter.

She watched as Brendan started gathering some of his and Chloie's things, preparing to leave again. On impulse, she asked, ""Brendan, your birthday is next Friday. Can I attend?""

Jayde had meticulously prepared a gift for Brendan's birthday every single year. This year would have been the tenth year. Ten. A perfect number. She wanted to see it through one last time.

Brendan had shielded her for ten years. She wanted to say a proper goodbye.

""We'll see,"" Brendan said, unwilling to commit. He pushed his suitcase toward the door and left.

The heavy sound of the door closing made Jayde's heart tremble slightly. Her eyes reddened.

Back in her room, she instinctively reached for the drawer in her bedside table, wanting to look at the love letters she had written to him. But when she opened it, the drawer was empty. She had already thrown away those brief but heartfelt letters. Only a faded sketchpad lay at the bottom of the drawer.

Jayde carefully took out the old sketchpad and gently opened it. The yellowed pages each showed Brendan in a different moment.

Brendan in his plaid school uniform, holding her hand, saying, ""Kid, I'm taking you home.""

Brendan on the highest podium, holding a trophy, hanging the gold medal around her neck. He had said, ""Kid, you're my badge of honor.""

Brendan at a formal banquet, holding a w\*\*e glass, in complete control, sending a thornless rose over to her table. He had said, ""Kid, roses need time to bloom. I'll wait for you to grow up.""

Every drawing was a memory etched deep in her mind.

But it didn't matter anymore. She would scrape those memories clean from her heart, bit by bit.

She turned to the last page of the sketchpad. It was blank. Jayde remembered that every year on Brendan's birthday, she would secretly draw a picture of the two of them together. She thought she would draw one this year, too.

But this year, the people in the drawing would be Brendan and Chloie Ellis.

This time, she genuinely wished them well.

She drew meticulously, st**ke by st**ke, with great care. She didn't stop until the sun began to set.

Then, she heard the sound of a key in the front door.

Jayde went out to the living room and saw Brendan stumble in. He smelled strongly of al\*\*hol.

""Brendan, why did you drink so much?"" Seeing his unsteady steps, she quickly went to help him.

Brendan leaned heavily on her, his large hand wrapping naturally around her waist. The strong scent of al\*\*hol mixed with his familiar woody cologne filled her senses.

Jayde froze. She wanted to step back, to create some distance, but the next moment, Brendan pulled her into his embrace.

His restless hand slipped under her clothes, and his burning, al**hol-fueled k**s landed forcefully on her lips.

Chapter 7 Jayde Rosario's mind went completely blank.

This was the scene she had dreamed of countless times, but now it was happening, real and overwhelming. A rough hand moved over her ch\*\*t, sending a jolt through her body that made her pull back, struggling against him.

""Brendan...""

Her struggle only seemed to make him more forceful.

""Chloie, be good..."" Brendan's passion-filled murmur exploded next to her ear like a clap of thunder.

In a daze, she felt herself being lifted. The man carried her into the bedroom and pushed her onto the bed.

It was only then, as she landed on the soft mattress, that she truly woke up from the intoxicating k\*\*s.

""Brendan Maynard, look closely! I'm Jayde Rosario! I am not Chloie Ellis!""

Jayde's voice trembled with a pain that was sharp and heartbreaking.

Brendan stopped. His eyes, clouded with drunkenness, glanced at her. Then he simply pulled her into his arms and held her, doing nothing else.

Jayde tried to get up, but Brendan's hoarse voice whispered in her ear.

""Don't go.""

Her body went stiff. Her hands clenched into fists at her sides. Was he asking her to stay? Or did he still think she was Chloie Ellis?

Deep, even breathing sounds came from beside her. Brendan had closed his eyes and fallen asleep.

A sudden, suffocating feeling of powerlessness washed over her. She tried to break free from his arms, but his grip was too strong. She couldn't escape.

Her head felt heavy, and the lingering smell of al**hol on his breath made her even dizzier. An overwhelming fatigue washed over her, and she fell into a dazed sl**p.

The next morning, the first thing Jayde saw when she opened her eyes was Brendan. He was standing by the bed, looking down at her with an unreadable expression.

""Jayde Rosario, why are you in my bed?""

The events of last night flooded her mind, and her face flushed with heat. She instinctively opened her mouth to speak, but Brendan cut her off.

""If this happens again, you'll move to the school dorms. And you will never enter my room again!""

The man's reprimand was mixed with disappointment and disgust. It made Jayde swallow any explanation she might have had.

""I'm sorry,"" she said quietly. ""It won't happen again.""

She knew that even if she told him the truth, he wouldn't believe her. In his eyes, she was just his stepsister who had inappropriate feelings for him.

It didn't matter. Only five days left. In five days, she would be in California. From now on, she wouldn't just avoid his room; she would disappear from his world forever.

Jayde got out of bed, pulling her messy clothes together, and walked out of the room.

Just as she stepped into the hallway, she ran into Chloie Ellis coming up the stairs.

""Jayde, why are you coming out of your brother's room so early in the morning?!"" Chloie's voice was sharp with shock.

Jayde's face turned pale. She was flustered and didn't know what to say. She avoided Chloie's gaze and fled back to her own room.

But as soon as she entered, Chloie followed her in, slamming the door shut behind her.

""You were in your brother's room all night. What did you do?"" Chloie stared at her, her eyes filled with a dark, scrutinizing light.

""We're both women. I've always known how you feel about your brother. I thought you knew your place, but I never expected you to be so shameless. You took advantage of him when he was drunk and climbed into his bed!""

Chloie's words were filled with blatant disgust.

Jayde lowered her head. She knew any explanation would be useless. ""Last night, he and I didn't...""

Before she could finish, Chloie interrupted her sharply. ""He and I had a fight yesterday, and that gave you an opportunity. But we are getting married soon. If you pull another disgusting stunt like this, I will make sure you leave the Maynard family forever!""

After her threat, Chloie glared at Jayde one last time, then turned and slammed the door as she left.

Jayde slowly slid down the wall to the floor. She felt as if all her strength had been drained from her body, leaving her weak and helpless.

Brendan's reprimand and Chloie's warning were like an invisible hand, gripping her heart and squeezing tight.

Large tears rolled down her face uncontrollably. The emotions she had suppressed for so long finally shattered.

Jayde covered her mouth with her hands, letting the tears flow silently through her fingers.

Chapter 8 After some time, Jayde Rosario heard the roar of a car engine outside. She looked out the window and saw that Brendan Maynard had driven away with Chloie Ellis. She calmly looked away from the window, curled up on her bed, and hugged herself tightly.

The next morning, her phone rang, breaking the silence in her room. The screen displayed 'Mom'. Jayde hesitated for a moment before answering.

""Mom...""

She had barely spoken when her mother, Glenna Taylor's, angry voice came through the phone. ""Brendan and I were traveling for a month, and you cause a scandal like this. Your brother is getting married, and you're still trying to climb into his bed! Jayde Rosario, do you have no shame? Get out of there! Don't live with your brother anymore!""

A wave of immense sorrow washed over Jayde. When she was little, her family had gone bankrupt. Her parents divorced. Her father went to California, and her mother remarried into the Maynard family, bringing her along.

Her mother always said she was a burden. She said that because of Jayde, she couldn't have another child with Mr. Maynard. Over the years, her mother had rarely shown any care for her. The only two times she had actively 'cared'were to blame her.

Once, when she confessed to Brendan, her mother had called and screamed at her, calling her shameless.

Today, her mother was accusing her of climbing into Brendan's bed, saying she had no shame.

""Mom, you didn't even ask what happened. You're just certain I was the one who initiated it?"" Jayde asked, her voice trembling.

The phone was silent for a moment. Then her mother's disgusted voice came again. ""We're both women. Don't think I don't know what you're thinking! If you affect my standing in the Maynard family, you can go find your dad!""

After saying that, her mother hung up.

The black screen of the phone reflected Jayde's lost and haggard face. She bit her l\*p hard, refusing to let the tears fall.

Looking at the word 'Mom'on her phone's contact list, she thought silently, Mom, don't worry. This daughter you dislike will completely leave the Maynard family, and you, in just 4 days.

For the next few days, Brendan didn't come home. Jayde was busy with her own preparations for going abroad and didn't pay any attention to where he and Chloie had gone.

Until 11:59 PM on August 24th. One minute before Brendan's birthday.

Jayde opened her social media and clicked on the only contact she had pinned. But after staring at the screen for a long time, she closed the chat. This was the first time in ten years she hadn't wished him a happy birthday.

At 8:00 AM the next morning, a flight reminder popped up on her phone.

Ms. Jayde Rosario, your flight will depart in 14 hours. Please arrive at the airport two hours in advance to complete check-in.

She calculated the time. She had only 12 hours left before she had to leave.

She found herself opening her social media again. She saw a new post from Chloie Ellis.

The sunrise by the sea is beautiful. Looking forward to the sunset and you this evening.

The post included a photo of her and Brendan holding hands at a place called Rose Coast.

Jayde's eyelashes fluttered. Her heart was calmer than she had expected.

At that moment, Chloie sent her a direct message.

Your brother wants to spend his birthday alone with me this year. I hope you won't disturb us.

Below the text was a 10-second video. In the video, Brendan was wearing a bathrobe, lying on a large, couple's-themed waterbed in a hotel room. Chloie was lying beside him, her shoulder exposed from under the blanket, covered in ambiguous red marks.

Jayde didn't need to think to know what kind of pa\*\*ionate night they had just had.

She just twitched her lips, quietly exited the social media app, and then began to reconfirm and clear out all of her belongings in the house.

4 hours left.

Jayde took the entire sketchpad from her drawer and tore her drawings of Brendan into tiny pieces, one by one. The shredded paper went into the tr\*\*h can, and the memories in her mind were cleared out, bit by bit.

3 hours left.

She threw out all her remaining personal items in the house, leaving no trace that she had ever lived there.

2 hours left.

She took the Totoro nightlight from her bedside table and placed it on the living room coffee table. She put it on top of the drawing she had made of Brendan and Chloie. It would be her last wedding gift to him, from his sister.

When she was eight, Brendan had been a light in her life. But from now on, she would be her own light.

Because she was a sunflower, no longer someone's rose.

1 hour left.

She left a small message in the bottom right corner of the sketch.

Brendan, happy birthday. Let's part ways here. We have no further connection.

I wish you all the best in a future without me.

Birds and fish travel different paths. Mountains and rivers will not meet again.

After that, Jayde picked up her phone. She deleted Brendan and Chloie Ellis as friends and deactivated her social media account. Then she did a full factory reset on her phone, erasing everything.

The whole process was done without a single moment of hesitation.

Having done all that, Jayde took one last look at the home she had lived in for ten years.

Then she turned and headed straight for the airport.

That was when Caitlin slid the wedding ring off her finger.The diamond still sparkled, but the love behind it had died a long time agoChapter 1Five years into their marriage, Xander Jackson cheated on Caitlin Schmidt.He had a mistress outside, but when Caitlin found out, she didn't cry or fight. Instead, she made the mistress leave willingly with a rich businessman in New York the next day.After that, Xander returned to Caitlin without saying anything and remained the caring, perfect husband.Caitlin thought it was just a minor episode.But a year later, her family's company went bankrupt.Her father, crushed by debt, jumped off a building. Her mother, tormented by loan sharks, was driven to her death. Her younger brother was hit by a car and left in a vegetative state.Unable to withstand the series of blows, Caitlin fell gravely ill and became bedridden.On the brink of death, Xander stood over her with a twisted expression. ""When you handed Eleanor over to that old man, she was tortured to death in bed. Her body was covered in bruises and wounds. You should've seen this coming, Caitlin. This is your karma.""It turned out that everything had been part of Xander's revenge.Lying weakly in bed, Caitlin stared at the man she'd loved with all her heart. She died with regret and hatred.But when she opened her eyes again, she was standing outside the study door.She was breathing hard, completely shaken. The fear and grief still hadn't worn off when she overheard the conversation inside.Xander was talking on the phone.""Thanks, man. I'll transfer your suburban villa to Eleanor's name first. I owe you a favor. Just don't let Caitlin find out.""That familiar sentence yanked Caitlin back to reality.Was she reborn?It was the same moment from her previous life when she accidentally found out Xander was cheating on her.As she snapped out of it, his voice rang out again. ""Eleanor is different. I feel alive and excited around her. But Caitlin? She just drains me. She's dull. I'm just taking a breather for now. Once I'm done having my fun with Eleanor, it won't stop me from loving Caitlin again.""Even though she'd heard it before, it still hurt like hell.Caitlin clenched her fists, her eyes stinging. She still remembered what he'd told her before she died.She took a breath, steadied herself, and sat down on the couch.When Xander walked out and saw her, he abruptly stopped.""Honey? When did you get back?""""Just got here.""Caitlin kept her voice calm, hiding everything she felt.The woman who was supposed to be shopping was suddenly home. Xander's guilty smile twitched as he said, ""There's a problem with a project. I need to head back to the company.""It was still the same excuse as in the previous life.Caitlin looked at him blankly for a few seconds. ""Alright, go ahead.""This time, she didn't have the energy to care anymore.As she expected, Xander didn't return home that night.Caitlin sat there until dawn. When morning light broke through the windows, she wiped her tired eyes, had a quiet breakfast, and headed out.She went to the law firm first. Then, she made her way to the Jackson Group.Xander's office was on the highest floor. As she stepped out of the elevator, the hallway was empty, but ambiguous noises slipped through the office door.""Mmm... Mr. Jackson, I can't take it anymore...""""Mr. Jackson?"" Xander sounded displeased. He grabbed her waist and pushed deeper, making her moan louder.Then, he asked deeply, teasing and firm all at once, ""Eleanor, you're being naughty. What are you supposed to call me?""Eleanor Leonard grabbed his hand, clearly enjoying herself.""Xander, please forgive me...""""Good girl.""Caitlin dug her nails into her skin. Even though she already knew the truth, she still felt heartbroken.She waited a long while before knocking.When she walked in, Xander was sitting at his desk, looking satisfied. ""What brings you here?""""I need you to sign something.""Caitlin reached into her bag and pulled out the divorce papers. She flipped right to the signature page and slid it across the desk.""What's this?""Xander took it and was just about to look at it.A faint moan came from underneath the desk. He jerked back with a shudder. When he came to his senses, he cleared his throat, trying to play it off like nothing happened.Caitlin acted like she didn't notice. Her fingernails dug tiny crescent marks into her bag as she forced down the bitterness and said, ""It's nothing. Just a property transfer form.""That was enough to erase Xander's doubts.He quickly grabbed a pen, scribbled his signature casually, and said, ""You could've just had someone drop this off. Don't tire yourself out.""Was he worried about her getting tired, or just worried she'd catch him red-handed?Caitlin smiled sarcastically. ""It's fine. Just this once. I'll head out now.""As soon as she stepped out, she pulled out her phone and made a call. ""I'm willing to sell 20% of the Jackson Group's shares at a discounted rate.""""Alright. When do we sign?""""In a month.""Once the divorce was final, she would walk away from the business she'd poured her soul into.In her previous life, Xander blamed her for what happened to Eleanor.This time, she'd give him what he wanted.Chapter 2Before leaving, Caitlin went to the restroom. As soon as she stepped out, she bumped into Eleanor.Eleanor had a curvy body paired with an innocent-looking face‚Äîpretty much the type most guys went for.""Still here, Mrs. Jackson?""She didn't even try to hide anything.Her blouse was slightly open, showing off the love bites on her skin like she wanted Caitlin to see. It was both a challenge and a brag.Caitlin paused and looked at Eleanor.In her previous life, she'd used tough tactics to scare Eleanor off in a single day, even convincing her to quit her job and move to New York.But now, Caitlin couldn't even be bothered.Without saying a word, she turned and headed straight for the elevator. But after only a few steps, hot coffee splashed down her back.""Oops!""Eleanor gasped and raised her cup. ""I'm so sorry! I might have overdone it a little to help Mr. Jackson relax. My hands are still shaky.""Hearing those words, Caitlin felt sick to her stomach, like she could picture every awful moment.She had no interest in being part of their drama anymore, but that didn't mean she'd let Eleanor walk all over her.So, she marched up and smacked Eleanor's face.Out of nowhere, Xander appeared.Eleanor quickly fell, clutching her cheek and dropping to her knees with a pitiful cry. ""I'm sorry, Mrs. Jackson. I didn't mean to upset you. Please don't be mad.""Xander rushed to her side.He shoved Caitlin aside. Her already burned back slammed into the edge of the wall, making her wince.But he didn't even notice. Instead, he squatted down beside Eleanor and asked, ""What happened?""She pursed her lips and said fearfully, ""I had low blood sugar. I got lightheaded and spilled coffee on Mrs. Jackson's back by accident. She got mad and slapped me. I deserved it.""Xander shot Caitlin a furious look.""She's an intern,"" he snapped. ""She just made a simple mistake. Did you have to take it that far?""Then, he scooped Eleanor up and carried her into the office.Watching his anxious reaction, Caitlin couldn't hold back the sting in her eyes.She remembered a time when she'd gotten a tiny cut on her finger. Xander freaked out, rushing her to the emergency room. The doctor had laughed at how dramatic he was. But now, he was worried about another woman.She told herself to move on, but the pain didn't just go away.Caitlin bit her lip, got to her feet, walked out of the office, and headed straight to the courthouse to file for a divorce. Once the cooling-off period ended, her marriage to Xander would be done for good.When she got home that night, he wasn't there.He only texted her, saying he had to stay late at work and reminded her not to be late for a business dinner the next day.It was something they had planned ahead of time.Caitlin simply replied, ""Okay.""She didn't bring up what happened earlier and didn't bother calling out his lie.There was no point anymore.The next day, when she arrived at the club, Xander was nowhere in sight. Instead, Eleanor showed up.""Mr. Jackson is tied up in a meeting,"" she said. ""He sent me to inform you and learn from you.""Eleanor changed her usual demeanor and looked serious now. Caitlin could only lead her into the private room.During the meal, Eleanor kept raising her glass and leaning way too close to the client. Anyone paying attention could tell her intentions.Caitlin had always disdained such behavior, so she left the table to use the restroom.When she got back, the place was packed with people. She pushed her way through the crowd to see what happened.The room was a mess. Xander had arrived, but the client was lying there, covered in blood.Chapter 3""What happened?"" Caitlin asked in confusion.Then she spotted Eleanor, who was disheveled and trembling as she curled up in Xander's arms. It all clicked.He was furious for the woman he loved.Before Caitlin could react, Xander slapped her face hard.""Don't act clueless!""His bloodshot eyes locked onto hers like a furious beast. ""Caitlin, do whatever shady stuff you want for business, but leave Eleanor out of it. She's not like you‚Äîshe's simple-minded.""Caitlin stood frozen.Her cheek stung, but her heart hurt more after hearing those words.Shady?She thought back to the early days of their company when she had hustled for clients. She had been put in the same risky situation, but she'd rather lose a deal than sell her dignity.Xander had even stormed off to teach that client a lesson.He beat the guy up and locked him in for a few days. Then, he comforted her. ""You did the right thing. Thanks for protecting yourself.""Everyone knew Caitlin hated backdoor deals.And now, he thought she was the one playing dirty.Tears fell from Caitlin's eyes. ""Is that how you see me?""Xander was stunned and hesitated.Right then, Eleanor clutched his sleeve, face flushed. ""Mr. Jackson, Mrs. Jackson told me to toast, but I said I can't handle alcohol. Mr. Zeller kept pushing drinks. I don't feel well...""Xander's face twisted with anger again, and he shot Caitlin a nasty glare. ""You've changed. You're not the person I used to know.""Without another word, he picked Eleanor up and walked away.Caitlin lowered her eyes, forcing a bitter smile.Yeah, people did change.Xander wasn't who he used to be either.On the way home, she was suddenly dragged into a dark alley.""What do you want?!"" she shouted, face going pale.Those men didn't answer. Instead, they shoved her down roughly.All around her were 99 liquor bottles.They cracked them open and started forcing her to drink. She tried to scream, but she was choked and unable to speak.The burning alcohol slid down her throat, sharp and painful.Caitlin fought back, but it was useless. She cried powerlessly.When they were done pouring the drinks, they yanked off her clothes, laughing and leering at her tender body.""Hold on,"" one guy said. ""Didn't the client just say to teach her a lesson? If we go too far, we'll be the ones in trouble.""Another guy shrugged. ""Come on, man. Who gets their wife treated this badly? If we mess her up, he'll even thank us.""Caitlin's eyes flew open in shock.Were they talking about Xander?Since Eleanor had been forced to drink and almost been taken advantage of, he felt bad for her and decided to let Caitlin go through the same thing.He did love Eleanor.Right when those men were about to lay a hand on her, a police siren blared nearby. A passerby shouted, ""Stop! I called the cops!""Those men panicked and bolted in different directions.Caitlin was safe, but she just stared blankly at the night sky, completely numb.Then, she broke down into tears.All the pain she'd been holding in came rushing out. She lay on the ground, gagging in agony. She threw up until there was nothing left but bile, then finally stood up and tremblingly made her way home.Chapter 4Xander didn't come home once that whole week.Neither of them reached out‚Äîjust like every time they fought or gave each other the silent treatment. No texts, no calls, nothing.Still, Caitlin knew where he was each day.Eleanor kept updating her Instagram, bragging nonstop. Dinner by candlelight, private movie nights, over-the-top firework shows‚ÄîXander was spoiling her with something new every single day.He also gave her designer bags, fancy jewelry, a house, and even an unlimited black card.Honestly, she looked more like his wife than Caitlin did.Caitlin wasn't sitting around sulking. She was at home, packing and tossing out memories. Since she had already decided to leave, there was no reason to keep anything that reminded her of him.The first day, when Eleanor posted nine lovey-dovey photos, Caitlin burned all 999 photos she had with Xander.The second day, after Eleanor showed off the custom clay dolls they had made together, Caitlin smashed all the antiques Xander had gifted her over the years.\*\*\*On the seventh day, Eleanor posted a video of Xander confessing his love to her. That was when Caitlin slid the wedding ring off her finger.The diamond still sparkled, but the love behind it had died a long time ago. She stared at it for a second, then flushed it down the toilet without hesitation.Later that night, Xander finally came back.The mattress dipped as he climbed into bed and hugged her waist. ""Honey, let's stop this silent treatment. Tomorrow is the company's tenth anniversary. Let's go together, okay?""It was also their fifth wedding anniversary.That day used to mean a lot. She had planned it every year, but this year would be the last.Caitlin shifted away from him and just said, ""Hmm.""As his hand missed, Xander froze.Figuring she was still mad, he felt confident the gift he prepared would make up for it.With that in mind, he fell asleep at ease.But the next day at the event, things went downhill fast.The giant screen on the cruise kicked things off with a video about the company's journey, and then it shifted to a sweet recap of Xander and Caitlin's ten-year relationship.They'd been through a lot together and always had each other's backs.The crowd couldn't help but admire them, and even Xander looked a little emotional.But just when everyone was feeling touched, the screen suddenly changed. Now it was showing a bunch of cozy pictures of Xander with Eleanor, plus some private ones of her.Gasps filled the scene, and everyone assumed Caitlin did it. After all, who else would expose the mistress but the wife?Xander's eyes became sharp as he snapped, ""Caitlin, what the hell is this?!""Caitlin was about to explain, but Eleanor burst in crying before she could say a word.""Mrs. Jackson, I never stepped over the line with your husband. Why are you doing this to ruin me?"" she sobbed.""Mr. Jackson, I'll just quit to keep your marriage safe. I don't want to be the reason for all this.""With that, she ran out of the banquet in tears.Xander tried to stop Eleanor, but Caitlin grabbed his arm.""It wasn't me,"" she said firmly.She refused to take the fall for something she didn't do.But Xander wasn't buying it. He shoved her off him, causing her to stumble back and crash into the champagne tower. She fell hard.Glass cut into her as she hit the floor.""You're now even stalking, secretly taking photos, and making up lies? Is there any line you won't cross? I was going to cheer you up, but that's no longer necessary.""Then, he pulled out an emerald necklace.It was an heirloom passed down in the Schmidt family for generations. Caitlin had pawned it years ago to help the company out. And later, she couldn't track it down.It turned out that Xander had found it.But the next second, he tossed it into the sea and ran after Eleanor without even looking back.""Don't!""Caitlin failed to stop him, so she climbed over the railing and jumped into the sea with injuries.Chapter 5She floated and dived into the sea for three hours.Every cut on her body burned way worse as the saltwater hit them, but she pushed through the pain and didn't give up. Eventually, completely drained, she finally spotted the emerald necklace.Soaked and a mess, Caitlin dragged herself back onto the deck, barely able to breathe.Clutching the necklace tightly, a flood of memories hit her. Back when she pawned it, Xander had sworn he'd give her the world and stay loyal forever. Now, it all felt like a big joke.She threw her head back and laughed out loud.But behind the laughter, she couldn't stop the tears and the sharp ache in her chest.Once Caitlin made it home, she was burning up with a fever.Lying in bed, she felt weak and powerless. Just then, Xander came in and yanked her out of bed.Thinking he was finally taking her to the hospital, Caitlin got in the car obediently.But halfway there, something felt off.""This isn't the way to the hospital. Where are we going?"" she asked in confusion.""Hospital?"" Xander let out a cold laugh. ""How dare you still say that after the mess you caused?!""Caitlin was still out of it, too fuzzy to make sense of what was happening, until the car stopped.He brought her to see Eleanor.After everything blew up online, people were criticizing Eleanor nonstop. She quit her job, left the villa overnight, and went back to her old place.Now, she was on the rooftop, ready to jump.When Xander brought Caitlin there, Eleanor backed up in a panic. ""Stay back!""""Eleanor, please don't do anything stupid!""His hands were shaking as he advised, ""I brought Caitlin here. She said she wants to apologize and post a statement online to clear your name.""Caitlin immediately snapped out of her daze.""No way."" She winced through the pain. ""Why should I apologize to her?""They were the ones who cheated. She was the victim. Why should she be the one to apologize?Eleanor's fists clenched.She kept her broken, pitiful look and said, ""Of course, Mrs. Jackson. You don't need to apologize. I deserve all this hate. My life is worthless anyway. Maybe I should just end it.""""No!"" Xander shouted.Then, he turned and growled at Caitlin, ""How can you be so heartless?! It's just an apology!""Then, he kicked her.Caitlin hit the ground hard, knees slamming against it.""If you won't do it, I'll crush your dad's business,"" he threatened.Suddenly, she remembered her previous life. With tears in her eyes, she looked up and asked, ""Xander, do our years together mean less to you than Eleanor's?""She asked that question on behalf of her from her previous life.They had been together for ten years, through every up and down. And now, everything was shattered.Xander was stunned for a moment, but he quickly returned to his cold self. ""Are you apologizing or not?""What other option did she have?A tear slid down her cheek as she said with humiliation, ""I'm sorry, Ms. Leonard. I'll post the clarification now.""She pulled out her phone and made the announcement.Right after that, Xander walked over to Eleanor, gently coaxing her. ""You heard it. It's done. Come down now.""Then, he helped her down.Caitlin felt heartbroken when she saw that.As she stood up, Eleanor came over, grabbed her hand, and said gratefully, ""Thank you, Mrs. Jackson.""But when Xander wasn't looking, Eleanor gave a smug smile and whispered, ""Don't you think it's kinda pathetic to be a woman like you?""Caitlin's anger flared. She tried to yank her hand free.But Eleanor clung even harder and yanked her off balance. They both stumbled backward, heading straight for the railing.""Ah!""They screamed together.Xander rushed over to help, but he only managed to catch Eleanor's hand.Caitlin fell.As she fell, flashes of their past ran through her mind.In the end, he still picked Eleanor.Chapter 6When Caitlin opened her eyes, she realized she was in a hospital bed.She hadn't died. That old building was only four floors tall, and the awning below softened her fall.Still, three of her ribs were broken, and every breath felt like stabbing pain.""Honey, you're finally awake!""Xander rushed in, looking exhausted like he hadn't rested in days. ""Now Eleanor can relax a bit. You have no idea how guilty she felt. She was so shaken up that she barely ate.""So, he'd been with Eleanor the whole time.Caitlin pulled her hand away and said sarcastically, ""With you fussing over her, she's bound to live forever.""Xander froze, then his expression darkened.""Do you have to be like this? Eleanor works under me, and she's all alone. I should look after her. If it weren't for your drama, none of this would've happened to her.""Once again, everything was somehow her fault.Caitlin just shut her eyes, too tired to argue.Right then, Eleanor called. ""Xander, where are you? I'm scared of being here alone.""""Hang in there. I'll be right back!""Xander quickly stood up. Then, he seemed to think of something and sighed. ""Caitlin, you've got me and the best doctors around. Eleanor has nothing. Don't keep picking fights with her.""He walked out without another glance.But the truth was that she had already lost him.Xander didn't visit her at all after that, but she didn't care anymore.She just focused on healing, followed the doctor's orders, and got better little by little.But on the day she was finally discharged, trouble hit the company.Caitlin was called into a meeting. It turned out that Eleanor had leaked a partner's confidential information. The board all asked Xander to fire her.""I swear I didn't mean to,"" Eleanor sobbed, eyes red.But no one felt sorry for her. The accusations kept piling up, louder and harsher by the minute.""That's enough!""Xander said coldly, ""I believe it was an accident. I've decided to give Eleanor 20% of my shares. She's a shareholder now, not an employee. No one can fire her.""Caitlin sat there in shock.She had spent ten years fighting side by side with him to get 20% shares, but Eleanor got 20% effortlessly in less than a month.He used to say control of the company would always stay between the two of them.But to protect Eleanor, he didn't hesitate to break that promise.It was just like their marriage.What was once only hers had now been passed to someone else. And maybe Eleanor mattered more than she ever did.Caitlin lowered her eyes and smiled bitterly. She clutched her hands as she hid the pain.With Xander shielding Eleanor, the board couldn't do anything.The shareholders soon left, clearly unhappy. Just as Caitlin got up to leave, two officers entered the room.""Excuse us, we've got a report about stolen trade secrets. Is Eleanor here?""The scene instantly froze.Eleanor immediately ducked behind Xander and motioned for help.He was quiet for a long moment and finally said, ""It wasn't her.""Everyone turned to look.Then, he added, ""We already did an internal check. The one behind it is... Caitlin.""When he pointed straight at Caitlin, time seemed to stop.""What did you just say?"" Caitlin's voice shook as her eyes widened in disbelief. ""Say that again. Who did it?""Xander walked up and took her hand gently.He spoke softly, ""If Eleanor gets a criminal record, she'll be done for in this field. But you've still got me. I'll take care of you forever.""Trust me. I'll get you out of this soon.""Then, he turned to the cops and selflessly handed over a USB drive. ""Here's the evidence we collected. It proves Caitlin is the one who leaked the info.""He'd even faked the evidence. She had no way out.Caitlin felt like ice was creeping through her veins.She broke free from his grip, and tears welled in her eyes.He once proposed to her in front of a crowd, promising to take care of her forever.Now, she finally understood what he meant.She felt like the biggest fool in the world.Chapter 7Caitlin sat in the interrogation room, completely helpless.No matter how many times she tried to explain, no one listened. In the end, they threw her into a detention center to wait things out.The moment she walked into the shared dorm, all eyes locked onto her.A woman with short hair and a toothpick between her lips said to her, ""Hey, newbie. Go greet our leader.""The so-called leader was sitting on one of the beds, buzz cut and all, staring Caitlin down with a sharp, hostile glare.Before Caitlin could even say a word, that short-haired woman kicked her knee, forcing her to the ground.Then, she spat at Caitlin, ""Can't you move faster? Do you want to die?""That leader got up, yanked Caitlin's hair, and said hoarsely, ""Are you the one who's messing with my friend's guy? You're pretty, though.""Hearing that, Caitlin figured it out.She gritted her teeth and said through the pain, ""Eleanor told you that? Do you know that she's the third party?""A slap landed hard across her face.""I already know that. But Eleanor said the one who isn't loved is the real third party. Otherwise, why would Mr. Jackson let you end up here to learn your lesson?""Caitlin's mind froze.So that was what Xander wanted?She thought she was numb by now, but the tears she'd been holding back all day finally broke loose.Before she could even catch her breath, that leader patted her cheek. ""You've got three days. Time to learn how things work around here.""With that, Caitlin was dragged away.On the first day, they filled her food with sand and stones and forced her to eat it all.The next day, they hung her up by the iron bed and used her as a punching bag, kicking and hitting her like she was nothing.On the third day, they stripped her and touched her roughly.Those three days felt like living in a nightmare.When she finally got out on bail, she was completely spaced out.She didn't even realize she got into the wrong car. The man claiming to be Xander's lawyer wasn't one at all.He worked for Xander's partner.Xander had set a trap, cornering his business partner until his partner was forced to file for bankruptcy and drop the appeal.Pushed to the edge, that partner snapped.He kidnapped Caitlin and Eleanor at the same time.The ride felt endless before the car finally stopped. They were dragged out and taken to an old, run-down dock.Caitlin spotted the man right away.""Mr. Castillo?!"" Her heart sank, and she tried to persuade him. ""Please don't do this. Let's talk. We can work something out.""Kenneth Castillo sneered, his eyes full of hatred. ""Talk? If talking worked, Xander wouldn't have crushed me like he did.""You guys leaked the intel first, then pushed me to the edge. If I'm going down, you're all going with me!""Then, he grabbed his phone and called Xander.""Xander, I've got both of your women right here. You've got one hour to show up with 15 million in cash. If you're late, I'll set one on fire and toss the other into the sea.""""You're insane!""There was a pause, then Xander's cold voice came through the line. ""If either of them gets hurt, I'll make sure you regret it for the rest of your life.""Kenneth laughed darkly. ""You don't scare me, Jackson. The clock is ticking. You've only got one hour.""After hanging up, he tied both women up.Caitlin was suspended over the sea, while Eleanor was on land, surrounded by gasoline.Before the hour was up, Xander showed up.He glanced between the two women, then focused on Kenneth. ""Let them go,"" he demanded.Kenneth smirked. ""Things have changed, Mr. Jackson. You have to listen to me. Where's the money?""As he spoke, he tightened his grip around Eleanor's neck.Xander didn't dare to argue and slid a black case toward him.""There's 15 million. Now let them go.""Kenneth opened the box, counted the cash, and smiled sinisterly. ""Too bad. I changed my mind. Now you can only pick one. One of them must die.""Chapter 8Caitlin's heart started pounding when she heard those.Deep down, she already knew Xander would pick Eleanor.Even though she tried to prepare herself for it, it still hurt more than she expected.But to her surprise, Xander didn't hesitate and said bluntly, ""I'm not choosing. I want them both!""Caitlin froze, completely caught off guard.Eleanor, on the other hand, clenched her jaw in frustration. Still, she put on a tearful act.""Mr. Jackson, don't worry about me. ""This is all my fault. Let me take the fall.""Then, without warning, she shoved Kenneth away.He stumbled back, dropping the lighter. In a flash, flames burst to life around them. In a rage, Kenneth threw Eleanor into the fire and slashed the rope holding Caitlin up.Both of them were in danger at the same time.As Caitlin hit the water, she caught one last glimpse. Xander looked panicked and rushed forward.But not toward her.He ran into the fire and shouted, ""Eleanor!""He pulled her out of the flames.Meanwhile, Caitlin sank to the bottom of the sea.That was when she realized he had made his choice.\*\*\*When Caitlin came to, she was lying in an operating room.Xander was standing over her furiously.""So this was your plan? Why did you team up with Kenneth to stage this drama? You thought you could trick everyone? I can't believe you'd do this.""Caitlin was confused. She couldn't get what he meant.Xander continued angrily, ""Eleanor told me everything. You refused to take the blame, so you set her up. How could you be so cruel?!""Caitlin's heart dropped. She got it now.Still, she had no clue what tricks Eleanor pulled to get Xander to believe it was all her doing.""It wasn't me. I didn't...""Her voice became hoarse from drinking too much seawater. She tried to push herself up and explain, but Xander cut her off, angrier than ever. ""Enough! Stop making excuses!""Caitlin paused and fell silent.Yeah, there was no point explaining it.No matter what she said, he'd always trust Eleanor over her. Why waste the effort?""So what now?""She looked up, voice dripping with sarcasm. ""You gonna punish me again for her?""Her contemptuous tone only made him explode.""Obviously! You hurt her, so now you're paying the price!""Xander's face was twisted in rage, veins bulging as he yelled, ""Eleanor got burned because of you! She needs a skin graft, and you're giving her yours!""Those words hit her like a punch.She couldn't believe he was so cruel to her.""No! I'm not doing that!""Caitlin tried to get up, but several bodyguards rushed in and held her down on the operating table.Xander didn't even flinch. ""There's nothing to discuss.""Then, he turned and walked out.Chapter 9Soon after, Eleanor was wheeled in.But the moment the door shut, she‚Äîwhose thigh was supposedly burned‚Äîgot out of bed unharmed and showed a smug smile.She glanced at the doctor coldly and ordered, ""Start the procedure. And skip the anesthesia. I want to see her suffer through every single cut.""The medical team exchanged nervous looks, but they didn't dare question her.Caitlin was frightened. She fought to break free, but her limbs were strapped down tightly.The scalpel touched her skin, and a burning wave of pain rushed through her.""Ah!""‚ÄãCaitlin let out a piercing scream, her body jerking.Eleanor burst into laughter like a devil, looking like she thrived on Caitlin's agony.Then came the second cut. Then the third. Each slice took away more skin. Blood soaked the operating table beneath her.Caitlin's forehead was drenched in sweat, her face ghostly pale. But she didn't scream or shed a tear anymore.The more she cried out in pain, the more satisfied Eleanor was.It wasn't until the 99th cut that the procedure finally ended.By then, Caitlin had blacked out.When she came to, she was already lying in a ward.Thick gauze was wrapped around both thighs, and just shifting a little sent sharp pain through her body.She stared blankly at the ceiling, feeling nothing at all. In her mind, she kept counting down the days.Only five more to go.Five more days, and she'd finally be free of Xander.While Caitlin rested in the hospital, he never once showed up. It felt like they were back to their usual silent war, completely ignoring each other's existence.After four days, she was cleared to go.Still weak, she pushed herself up, grabbed her stuff, and got ready to leave.When she passed by a ward, she heard Eleanor's sweet voice from inside.""Dad, Mom, I'm doing great! Xander has been taking care of me this whole time. Oh, by the way, he's not just my boss. He's also... my boyfriend.""Caitlin froze.Through the crack in the door, she saw Xander holding Eleanor's hand and smiling warmly. ""It's my responsibility to look after her. Please trust me. I'll take care of Eleanor for the rest of her life.""Eleanor's mother was all smiles. ""No problem. She's lucky to have someone like you.""Those words reminded Caitlin of the past.Back when Xander proposed to her at her parents' house, he looked at them and said solemnly, ""You can trust me with Caitlin. I'll take care of her for the rest of my life.""Now, he used those promises casually like they meant nothing.Caitlin smirked and walked out of the hospital without any sadness.The following day, after she got back home, Xander showed up too.He headed upstairs, took a quick shower, and changed into some relaxed but decent clothes. Before leaving, he told her, ""I've got a business trip coming up. I'll bring you back something nice.""He leaned forward to kiss her forehead.But she avoided it. ""Just go.""Xander paused, sensing something was off. But he shrugged it off and walked out with a smile.As soon as he left, Caitlin also left and headed straight to the courthouse.She felt extremely happy when she got the divorce certificates.She slipped one into the bag and mailed the other to the Jackson Group.Then, she snapped her SIM card in half and got into the car.From then on, Caitlin was officially done being Xander's wife.",1,1753431752.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

1m8tn85,https://www.reddit.com/r/BlackNovel/comments/1m8tn85/no_i_screamed_as_my_pup_was_brutally_ripped_from/,"NO!!"" I screamed as my pup was brutally ripped from my belly by my Alpha mate","NO!!"" I screamed as my pup was brutally ripped from my belly by my Alpha mate, who believed my stepsister's lie about my betrayal.

I died in hatred, but when I woke, I was reborn.

Laughing through tears, I swore, ""You two will pay for your sins!""

""Please don't do this."" I begged over and over, but no one was listening. ""I am your luna."" I screamed at the top of my lungs, but then his laugh from the other room broke all the fight in me.

""Luke please."" I begged once more time, my voice horse.

""Take it once it's done. Toss her out. She will have to survive on her own from here on out.""

He can't mean that. This was our baby.

""Is a mistake from the Moon Goddess. One I will rectify."" His voice called again from the other room. He wouldn't even face me. ""Now do it. That's a command.""

""Yes, Alpha.""

""Oh, and doctor?"" Her sweet voice called from the other room. My stepsister, Shannon. I gritted my teeth. ""Don't use any anesthetic. She should feel everything.""

""Yes, Luna."" The doctor turned back to me with sad eyes, but when he picked up the scalpel, I knew I was screwed.

I'm sorry, baby. Momma couldn't save you. I tried to rub my stomach, but the nurses had strapped me down. When the doctor approached, I realized he was using a silver blade.

""Silver?"" My whisper was almost silent, but he nodded. I knew then that Shannon didn't want me to survive. She wanted my life so badly that she lied about me cheating on my mate, showing photos as proof.

I cried silently as the doctor cut into my abdomen, and I felt my baby thrash inside. He knew it was too early to be born. This was a death sentence for both of us.

""Bring me the body of the pup.""

""Yes Alpha.""

I felt every slice as he cut into me, and finally I could take it no longer. I thrashed against the restraints. But the silver had made me weak.

""Doctor, now.""

""Yes Alpha."" The doctor picked the baby up and rushed out, leaving me spread open to the elements.

I felt my life slipping away as the door opened and Shannon came in. Her smug smile was firmly in place.

""I told you I would take your life, Amy. I would have your mate. "" Shannon walked over and laid a kiss on my face as I snarled. ""He is perfection. And don't worry. I will give him another son."" She laid her hand on her stomach and I started to laugh. ""What's so funny?""

""I can smell the beta on you. That's Derek's child, and it's a girl. Nice try though.""

She snarled and raised her hand, growing her claws to deliver the final blow, but the door was ripped open and my mate, the man I now hated most in the world, stepped inside. His eyes were red, and I started to laugh again.

""You runt!"" He snarled and struck out, whipping Shannon to the other side of the room.

""Brandon!"" Shannon shrieked as she hit the wall. ""What's wrong?"" She staggered to her feet, but more blood dripped out of me and I closed my eyes.

""You lied!"" He screamed, shaking the walls as his aura struck out, but I could barely feel it. I felt the silver travelling in my veins getting closer to my sluggish heart. ""This was my pup. I can smell me on him."" Brandon's eyes grew redder as the tears gathered. ""She did cheat on you. I guess I was wrong about the pup.""

""You said you smelt it."" From the sound of it, he lunged for her again, but him clutching our baby in his arm was the last thing I saw. And I wanted to never see it again. He did this to us. Not Shannon.

She played her part well, sure, but him not believing me, not waiting for a few more days to smell the pup, that was his fault. And all of our downfalls.

I prayed for the moon goddess to take me. I no longer wanted to be here. I wanted to be with my pup.

""Save her.""

""No!"" Shannon screamed. ""I am the Luna now, you marked me last night."" Ah, so that was the pain I felt last night.

I cracked my eyes to see my mate, Brandon, hovering next to me. ""Stay with me Amy.""

""No!"" I slammed out, putting all of my power in it.

Brandon looked down at me, pleading. ""Let me save you.""

""I am descended from the Moon Goddess, and you don't deserve to save me. You don't deserve our pup. You were weak. And now you lost everything."" I smiled up at him as I felt my life from my body.

Chapter Two

I opened my eyes to find myself surprisingly alive. ""Amy hurry, you're going to be late."" I jolted up and look around, confused. What was going on? Where was I? ""Amy!"" The voice called again and I shook myself. I stood up from the bed and looked around again. I recognized this room. It was my childhood bedroom.

I hadn't stepped foot in this room since I found my mate, Brandon. I heard a knock on the door and my mother opened it. Before I could process what was happening, I ran into my mother's arms. ""Mom, you're here."" I started to cry. ""I've missed you so much.""

""Amy. My girl."" She laughed as she patted my back. ""I saw you yesterday."" She pulled back and I looked into her amber eyes that matched my own. ""Happy birthday, baby.""

I leaned into her hands and realized that today was the last day I spent at home. I found my mate on my eighteenth birthday. ""Thank you, mom.""

""Hopefully, you will meet your mate today and start your new life."" She smiled at me and I felt my blood freeze. I didn't want to meet Brandon. Not when I knew what was going to happen.

""I'd rather stay here with you."" I smiled as I kissed her cheek. ""I don't want to miss you and Morgan.

And I knew that when Brandon thought I cheated on him, before he treated my baby and me like that. He also did the same to my mother for her involvement. Shannon's father, my mother's husband, watched her die.

""Baby. You won't miss us. We will be there every step of the way."" She kissed my cheek, and I wrapped my fingers around hers.

""Mom, can we just leave? You and me? Leave Shannon and Morgan and move back to daddy's pack?"" My father, the Alpha of the Silvermoon pack, wasn't a good husband, but he was a good man. He cheated on my mother, betraying her when he was drunk.

His betrayal cost the life of my brother growing inside of her, and she refused to move past it.

""No baby. I can't go back."" My mother's face fell as she turned away.

""I don't want to be betrayed, mom. Not like you and not any worse. I don't want a mate."" I whispered my new truth.

""What do you know?"" I watched as her eyes searched mine.

I pulled her back into my room and away from the door. ""I don't know for sure, but I am terrified that if I am mated to Shannon's boyfriend, I will die after we are mated. Mom, the chances that he will match with an Alpha far outweigh the chance that he is mated to the daughter of the beta."" I pulled back. ""I don't want this for me.""

She weighed my words, and I watched as she came to the same conclusion. ""Okay baby. But you can't leave. It would be too conspicuous. You will have to mask your scent whenever he is around.""

I tossed my hands in the air. ""How would I do that?""

""There is much you don't know that I would leave in the past but if you are sure..."" She trailed off and I just nodded my head. ""Then let me make a few calls. You don't have to go to school today.""

I lept back into her arms. ""Thank you, mom. I don't know what I would do without you.""

""I love you, baby. You will never be without me. That I can promise you."" She kissed my cheek and then left me alone in my room.

I ran to my phone and checked the date to make sure. It was twenty eighteen; I went back six years. Six years to the day that I met Brandon. I could relive everything, make better choices. I could live, and maybe this time around, so would my pup.

I went into my ensuite and jumped into the shower. No way was I going to face today, looking like I just crawled out of bed. I stood in side my closet in a towel trying to figure out what to wear when I heard my bedroom door open.

I was about to turn and call out to my mother, but I heard a soft step, which my mother wouldn't do. So I hid behind my winter coats and I waited.

""I'm telling you, if she is Brandon's mate, I'm going to destroy her.""

""You can't mean that, Shan."" The nasily voice of Megan, Shannon's best friend, came from the cell phone pressed to her ear.

""Of course I do. Brandon is mine.""

""Only because you put out. He was hoping Shannon would notice him.""

""You shut your mouth, Megan."" Shannon snarled and her eyes flashed. ""He's mine.""

""Whatever I gotta go,"" Megan called, and then the line went dead. A honk sounded from outside and Shannon was snatching something before I grabbed her hand.

""What do you think you're doing in my closet?""

""Amy?"" Shannon's mouth dropped out. I squeezed her hand until I heard a crack. Her scream was muffled by my hand.

""You're lucky I only broke one finger. You just threatened to destroy me. Didn't I hear that correctly? A beta's daughter threatening an alpha."" I tsked.

""I didn't do anything."" She snarled back at me as her hand reformed.

""Lie again and I will break all of your fingers and hold them while the bones heal."" I couldn't stop my grin as I felt her tremble. ""Did you threaten me?""

""Yes."" she screamed at me. ""You're going to take Brandon from me.""

""I don't want your pathetic alpha now or ever. Keep him."" I pushed her away. ""Now get out of my room before I change my mind about maiming you."" I turned back to my clothes and picked out low-rise jeans and a tank top.

""What is your problem?""

""You. Now leave."" I let my wolf come forward and my eyes flashed. I pushed my alpha command into my words and forcing her out of my room. Foolish girl. How dare she come into my room to take something of mine? My wolf growled lowly. This was our den. I shook myself and refocused. Closing the doors, I hopped back into bed, pulling out my phone. I tried to remember everything that happened in the last six years that could help me with my plan. Because make no mistake, Brandon and Shannon would pay.

Chapter Three

""Pack your bags, Amy."" My mom came in, surprising me from the list I was making.

""What?"" I looked up. ""Why?""

""You are going to spend the summer with your father. I already got the approval from the Alpha."" Mom smiled down at me. ""Come on, baby. Pack your bag and get ready.""

I jumped to my feet and ran to my mom. ""I can go?""

""Just for the summer, baby, then you will be back here with me. I had to promise that you would be returning here.""

I pouted. ""Mom, I really don't want to be here."" I wanted to make them pay, but I wouldn't risk him finding me.

""It's okay baby, you will understand once you see your dad."" She patted my hair and kissed my cheek. ""Now get ready.""

""Okay mom."" I kissed her back then she left me alone. I grabbed my phone to lock it and then turned back to my closet. I packed my bag and then headed into my bathroom when I heard the downstairs door slam open.

""I knew it."" I heard Shannon scream down stairs. I ignored her as I grabbed everything from my bathroom and then I grabbed my laptop and chargers. I stuffed everything in to my backpack and headed downstairs.

""Shannon, why are you screaming?"" Morgan was at the table with his coffee, and my mom was running around when I pushed my suitcase into the room.

""I'm not Brandon's mate, daddy."" Shannon flew into the room and dove into his arms.

""How are you so sure?"" Morgan wrapped his arms around her, but I just snickered. She snapped her eyes to me and she flew at me.

""It's you."" Shannon tried to claw out my eyes. But I just sent her flying with a backhand.

""Amy!"" Morgan got to his feet but my mom tsked.

""Morgan, you can't yell ay Amy for protecting herself. Shan attacked her first."" My mom placed my breakfast on the table. ""Amy, come eat. You have a long day ahead.""

""Babe? Why does Amy have a suitcase?""

""She is going away for the summer. To her fathers."" My mother turned to me and opened her arms. ""Come baby. Come eat. The car is coming and you need to be ready to go.""

I walked over and sat down, and dug in.

""Why is she going to her dads?"" Morgan walked over to pick Shannon up.

""She wanted to spend the summer with her dads before college and who am I to say no?"" My mom smiled down at me and I smiled back at her. I didn't know what was going to happen this summer to protect me from Brandon finding out I was his mate, but I needed it. Whatever it was, I needed it.

""Yeah, my dad called me this morning and since I haven't seen him since Christmas break and when he offered to fly me out, I asked my mom."" I smiled sweetly over at Morgan, and Shannon smiled.

""You're leaving?"" Shannon stood up.

""Yup. I'll be gone the full summer."" I smirked over at her. ""But my room is locked, and it will stay that way."" My smile dropped away as I stared at her and used my alpha command.

""Amy!"" Morgan yelled out. ""You know you're not allowed to alpha command your step sister!""

""And I wouldn't have Morgan, if I hdn't found her in my room this morning, trying to take things out of my closet."" I turned and raised my eyebrow, daring her to try to lie.

""Is that true?"" Morgan looked down at Shannon and I just stared at her. I watch her open her mouth to deny it.

""I wouldn't lie. I'll just command you to tell the truth."" She screeched and stomped her foot.

""Yes!"" she screamed. ""Are you happy? Yes, I went into her closet to steal some clothes because I know she is Brandon's mate.""

""How?"" I threw up my hands, playing like I didn't know the truth. ""How could you possibly know that I am his mate? Neither of us has scented each other.""

""Because he scented you on me!"" Her voice was hitting a higher octave, and my ears were starting to hurt.

""Calm down. You're hurting everyone's ears and just explain yourself."" My mom sat next to me at the table, rubbing her head.

""Last month, Brandon turned eighteen, and I was wearing Amy's dress. He scented around me and said I smelt divine. But when I'm not wearing her clothes, he has zero interest in me."" Shannon pouted.

""So he likes the way I smell, doesn't mean we are mates."" I pointed out. Completely and utterly denouncing Brandon as a mate. If I didn't accept him, he would never be my mate anyway, and I would never accept him. That was the only thing I was sure of.

Brandon would be the last male I would ever touch this time around.

""Stop being obtuse Amy. We all know what it means when a wolf likes your smell."" Shannon started to cry and buried her head in her hands. ""He's the male I want, daddy. The only one I would ever accept. But he wants her."" She pointed to me.

I scoffed. ""I don't want your sloppy seconds, Shannon. Even if he was my mate, and I am not saying he is. It would be a cold day before I accepted him as a mate. I would take the Lycan King over Brandon."" I threw my head back and laughed when she gasped.

The Lycan king was the bogeyman of all wolves.

The last Lycan to exist and one who lives in the wild. It's said the only wolves that ever see his face are the council that oversees the packs.

But either way, I wasn't lying. I would take the King as a mate before I would even look in Brandon's vicinity.

""You're lying. He's the alpha.""

""And?""

""Everyone wants to be the luna.""

""Idiots want to be the luna."" I turned back and finished my food as Morgan calmed her down. My mom stood when she heard a horn.

""That's for you.""

I nodded as I stood and kissed my mother goodbye before I left.

Chapter Four

I slipped into the back of the car after putting my bags in the back and buckled in. I had barely takin a breath before I launched myself over the seats and into the driver's arms.

His laugh made my eyes prickle. ""Hey love bug.""

""Uncle Ronnie. I've missed you."" I climbed over the seats and sat up front. ""What are you doing here?"" Ronnie was my dad's beta. Not related, but he had been there for most of my life.

""You think I was going to let my cheeky niece come to pack lands alone? Not on your life.""

""Dad sent you?"" I laughed.

""Dad sent me. He is a worry wart your da."" He smiled over and laughed with me. ""As soon as your mom called, he sent me with the jet.""

""He didn't have to."" I just shook my head and buckled my seatbelt.

""Of course he did. He never gets to see you enough, and now you're sending in the summer. What's going on?"" My uncle looked at me and I just shook my head.

""I don't want to be here.""

""Why?""

I looked down at my hands that were twisted. ""I'm afraid that my mate is here and I don't want to be right. I figured if I ran away, I could push off the inevitability.""

""Why wouldn; t you want your mate?"" My uncle asked as he zipped down the highway toward the airport.

""I'll tell both you and dad, just not now."" My uncle looked over at me, searching my face and then nodding.

""Fine, but I want the full story.""

""You will get it, I swear."" I nodded back to the road. ""Now focus on driving so you don't ruin us."" I grabbed the wheel, swerving back into our own lane.

""Heck!"" Uncle Ronnie grabbed the wheel from me and focused back on the road. ""I just worry about you, pup."" I couldn't stop the laugh because wolves stopped aging at twenty-five, and he looked barely older than me.

""I know you do."" I settled back into my seat and sighed. ""I promise, what happened isn't going to make that feeling any better."" I wiped at my face. ""I don't even know why my mom is sending me to my dad. She just said that he could help me.""

""Well, let's hurry and get back so we can figure out what you need, Sugar."" My uncle hit the gas, and we ended up at the airport in no time.

We loaded my bags and headed up to the jet, settling in there. ""Close your eyes. You look like you barely slept today and we have a few hours."" My uncle patted my head before he sat across from me and opened his laptop.

""Work?""

""Work."" He nodded.

""This summer, can you teach me some stuff?"" A plan was forming in my mind, a plan not only to keep myself away from my pathetic mate, but one that would make me a lot of money.

""Of course, Sugar."" My uncle smiled up at me. ""You know, your dad would teach you just about everything he could if you were open to it.""

""I asked to move to your pack."" I snuggled into the blanket the flight attendant handed me, and Ronnie froze.

""What is going on?"" His eyes flashed.

""I'll explain later. Just promise you will try to believe me and not judge me.""

""Of course, Sugar."" He smiled and then turned back to the laptop on his lap. ""Now get some sleep.""

""Will do."" I turned away and fell asleep almost instantly.

I woke up to Ronnie shaking me. ""We are here.""

I gave an enormous yawn and cracked my jaw before wiping my eyes. ""Okay."" I handed off the blanket and wiped my face again. ""Thank you.""

""No problem, Princess."" The flight attendant smiled down at me, and I realized belatedly that she was from the pack too.

""You don't have to call me Princess.""

""You are the Alpha's daughter."" She bowed and then left us to our own devices.

""Come on, your dad has already linked me three times since landing."" Ronnie laughed and whisked me off to the waiting car. With in thirty minutes we were at our pack lands. ""You dad would allow you to move here if you wanted to, Sugar.""

""I know. But Alpha Dan won't allow me to leave..."" I looked over and blew out a breath. ""I think he assumes something I am running from and won't let me leave until he knows for sure.""

""You going to tell me yet, Sugar.""

I hesitated as we pulled up out front of the pack house. Before I could answer the door was ripped open and I was surrounded by powerful arms and a smell that made my quaking insides settle.

""Dad.""

""Hey my pup."" His deep voice calmed me further, and I could feel my eyes prickle.

""I've missed you."" I sniffled as he unbuckled my seat belt and I was in his arms fully.

""As I have missed you."" He kissed my temple. ""Now we have much to discuss."" He was running with me before I could utter another word, with Ronnie following behind.

""Slow down, jack ass. Some of us can't move that fast."" Ronnie struggled to keep up and my laughter filled the halls of the pack house. We settled in my father's office with an out of breath Ronnie, who was scowling. God, I missed these two.

""Tell me what's wrong, pup."" I looked around and still I stumbled over my words. My father grabbed my face and shook his head. ""Nothing you tell me will change anything, pup. I believe you, no matter how crazy it seems.""

""Agreed Sugar.""

My insides settled when I saw how resolute he was. He would believe my craziness. I could tell no matter how crazy my story was, my father and Ronnie would believe everything I said.

I never had to second guess if I was going crazy here.

So finally I settled fully and told my story.

Chapter Five

""I lived another life, and I died."" I stumbled over my words and I felt my father freeze. A quick look to Ronnie had him locking the door and waving his hands. I felt the air still, but I was focused on my father's eyes. ""This morning I woke up six years in the past after living until I was twenty-four, and growing my own pup only to have my mate to rip him from my body.""

My father's and Ronnie's snarl shook the walls, but I raised my hands. ""He betrays me for my step sister who convinced him that I cheated and the pup wasn't his, so he brought death to us both using silver scalpels, and burying any love I had for him at the same time."" I looked up at my father and the tears rolled down my face.

""Pup."" His voice was choked up, but I raised my hand.

""I don't want him to be my mate, daddy. I know I won't survive it. I need to change it. Everything, and it starts with hiding my scent. I told mom what I needed, and she called you. How are you going to help me?"" I was starting to panic. ""I don't want to die. I don't want my pup ripped from my stomach only for him to smell himself on him. I don't want to create life just to have it ripped from me daddy. I can't."" My soul was ripping and even though I want revenge, this was the first time I was given to truly grieve the lost of my pup.

""Sugar."" Ronnie's voice was barely a whisper and then I felt my father lose control.

""Who?"" His voice was pure darkness. His fist slammed into the desk, creaking the thick wood, and I looked up to find my father's wolf looking back at me. ""Who hurt you, my pup? Who did those my grand pup?"" Loki's voice was deeper than I had ever heard and his eyes promised retribution.

""Brandon, the alpha's son."" I whispered the final piece and everything seemed to click. The air rushed back in and my father's wolf shifted into his black form. I screamed and Ronnie dove in front of the door.

Loki snarled, but Ronnie held firm. ""You can't go for him for something that hasn't come to pass yet, Loki. You know how this works. You have been through it yourself."" But Loki just snarled.

""Daddy, please."" I begged. I knew if he got out, Brandon and Shannon were dead and the council would be on his doorstop. Loki whirled on me and softened at the devastation he saw on my face. He padded over and licked the tears from my face before going back behind the desk and shifting again.

""I'm sorry Amy, I lost myself for a moment."" He opened a door and slipped into some shorts. He wiped at his face before he sat back down. ""I guess its our turn to come clean.""

""Daddy?"" I sniffled and looked up at him.

""I'm not just a wolf, although, as you can see, Loki is very much a part of me."" His laughter was weak, but I just smiled. ""My mother was a shaman of our people, a witch, and my father had to have her. Even if it was just for a night. And I was born.""

""A witch?"" I dropped my hands, and he just had a small, sad smile.

""Yeah. You would have loved her, but witches don't live like us. They have the lifespan of a human, a flash in the pan. She was gone long before I met your mother."" He shook his head. ""One of her powers was exactly what you explained, a second chance. The moon goddess passed us down with the same powers. I had mine when I was your age as well.""

I jolted back as he nodded. ""What?""

""I never cheated on your mother."" His words were soft. ""I alpha commanded a wolf to pretend I did when she came to me and told me she was with pup. You see, in my first life, I stayed with her and we had three wonderful pups, but one night, my enemies attacked and the four of your were all murdered."" His swallow was thick.",2,1753431696.0,BlackNovel,1,1.0,False

Halfway through my shower, the doorbell rang.  
  
I ignored it. It rang again.  
  
I stepped out of the bathroom and opened the door to find a girl standing outside.  
  
""I'm your new neighbor. I left something at your place‚Äîmind if I grab it real quick?""  
  
Before I could agree, she rushed straight to my room, pulled out a pair of lace panties from under my fianc√©'s pillow, and said with a flushed face:  
  
""My water got cut off yesterday, and I was desperate, so I came over to use your shower. Hope you don't mind.""  
  
She left with her underwear, and I slumped back onto my couch in a daze.  
  
After sitting there for what felt like forever, I finally got up‚Äîonly to feel something weird under the cushions.  
  
I pulled it out and instantly hurled it across the room‚Äîit was a goddamn used condom?!  
  
Bile shot up my throat.  
  
I couldn't hold it back anymore. I bolted to the bathroom and threw up until I was seeing stars.  
  
I was so out of it that I didn't even notice when Rhett came home and found me there.  
  
""Wren, babe, what's wrong?""  
  
The concern in his eyes looked genuine enough. He helped me to my feet, his hand steady on my shoulder.  
  
""What happened? Should I take you to the hospital?""  
  
I stared at his face‚Äînot a single crack in that perfect mask.  
  
Doubt began creeping into my mind‚Äîwas I being too paranoid?  
  
A pair of underwear and a used condom didn't necessarily mean anything.  
  
Maybe it was all a misunderstanding.  
  
Maybe I was just being crazy.  
  
My eyes were bloodshot as Rhett helped me onto the couch. I wrapped my hands around the warm water he'd brought me and shook my head.  
  
""I'm fine. Probably just caught a chill last night.""  
  
Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were kids.  
  
I shouldn't be doubting twenty-five years of history between us.  
  
I shouldn't be tearing down the walls of trust we'd built together over some stupid paranoia.  
  
I pulled myself together and gave him a reassuring smile. ""Really, I'm okay. Don't worry about it.""  
  
Our wedding was just around the corner.  
  
Nobody wants their relationship to fall apart right before their big day‚Äîincluding me.  
  
Rhett gently stroked my hair and said, ""Let me make you some vegetable soup.""  
  
I nodded, watching his retreating figure with a warm feeling in my chest.  
  
Right as I was scrolling through TikTok, waiting for the soup, the doorbell rang again.  
  
I stayed put on the couch and heard Rhett call out:  
  
""Wren, can you get that? I'm kinda tied up here.""  
  
I glanced toward the kitchen where he was locked in battle with some hairy crabs.  
  
I laughed and went to open the door, only to find that same neighbor girl standing outside.  
  
She scratched her head sheepishly. ""I didn't cook tonight. Mind if I crash your dinner?""  
  
The apartment across the hall had been empty for two years. Suddenly there's a new neighbor, and I had no clue about it?  
  
What kind of person moves in and immediately shows up asking for free meals?  
  
I was about to tell her no when she looped her arm through mine and held up a cup of bubble tea.  
  
""I brought boba! The more the merrier, right? And don't worry‚ÄîI'll totally take your trash away when I leave!""  
  
She didn't give me a chance to refuse, practically dragging me back inside.  
  
As the same time, Rhett emerged from the kitchen carrying a bowl of soup, smiling as he asked:  
  
""Who was it?""  
  
When he saw the neighbor girl's face, his expression went stone cold.  
  
She chirped up playfully: ""Hey there, Rhett! I'm here to mooch some food. Your girlfriend invited me‚Äîhope that's cool?""  
  
Rhett's gaze shifted to me.  
  
I didn't bother sugarcoating it. ""I never did that.""  
  
I yanked my arm free from the neighbor's grip. Pointing at the bubble tea, I said to Rhett, ""Looks like you've been having a grand time while I was away.""  
  
I'm not the type to suffer in silence.  
  
There's no way Rhett couldn't see this girl had ulterior motives.  
  
Maybe he was waiting for me to give him an out‚Äîwaiting for me to say, ""Yeah, I totally invited her over for dinner.""  
  
But I didn't want to.  
  
I locked eyes with him, demanding an answer.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
Just like when we were kids and someone tried to come between us, Rhett would always say the same thing:  
  
""In this whole wide world, Wren comes first. Of course I'm choosing Wren.""  
  
I looked at Rhett, then at the neighbor girl, whose eyes were suddenly welling up with tears. She slammed the bubble tea down on the table and snapped:  
  
""I seriously didn't mean anything by it! My power and water got cut off yesterday, so I came over to use your shower. I just wanted to thank you guys today‚Äîthat's why I brought the boba!""  
  
Her tears started streaming down.  
  
""Do you really have to give me the cold shoulder like this?""  
  
I still didn't respond. I kept my eyes locked on Rhett. He rubbed his temples, then walked over to the table, picked up the bubble tea, and handed it back to her.  
  
""My girlfriend doesn't mess around. Letting you in yesterday was my mistake. You should go.""  
  
The neighbor broke down even harder. ""We didn't do anything! Why is she acting like I'm some homewrecker?""  
  
She made it sound like I was the one in the wrong.  
  
But that condom on my couch, and the red hair I'd found‚Äîit was the exact same shade as this neighbor girl's.  
  
I had no idea when Rhett, who usually kept strangers at arm's length, had become so generous that he'd let some random person into our home. Into our bathroom, no less.  
  
A guy and a girl alone together. Who knows what could happen?  
  
The neighbor turned her tear-streaked face toward me.  
  
""I was just trying to be nice! You're the one with a dirty mind, so of course everything looks dirty to you! I just moved in‚ÄîI don't want drama with my neighbors, but you're being way too much!""  
  
By all logic, Rhett had asked her to leave. If she had any shame, she would've walked out. But she kept standing there, putting on a show. For whose benefit?  
  
I looked at her, completely unmoved by her guilt trip.  
  
""Fine. I'm being too much.""  
  
I threw the door wide open.  
  
""Please leave!""  
  
This time, the neighbor couldn't stick around. She stamped her foot and ran out crying. The apartment fell dead silent. Rhett gave me a look that said he was at his wit's end.  
  
""Wren, don't you think you went too far?""  
  
Rhett and I had been inseparable since we were in diapers. When we were seventeen, Rhett bought up every firework in the entire city just to get me to agree to be his girlfriend, confessing his love under that dazzling display of lights.  
  
""Wren, do you want to date me with marriage and growing old together as our endgame?""  
  
I looked at my boy, trembling as he poured his heart out, and threw myself into his arms with tears in my eyes.  
  
Our relationship had been smooth sailing ever since. Everyone envied me for having such a perfect childhood-friend-turned-fianc√©.  
  
And now, here he was, taking some random girl's side against me.  
  
""You know how important reputation is to a girl. What you just said could get her labeled as a homewrecker!""  
  
""Wren,"" Rhett walked past me, deliberately bumping my shoulder hard enough to make me stumble back. ""I was just trying to save your face, but that doesn't mean I think you were right.""  
  
With that, He stormed out, leaving me alone with the lingering smell of soup.  
  
Was I wrong?  
  
Had I messed up?  
  
When I was spiraling into self-doubt, my phone buzzed with a friend request notification.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
My heart skipped a beat as I saw videos from an unknown sender.  
  
In the footage, Rhett was sitting on our couch with the neighbor girl, helping her blow out candles on a cake. His voice was sickeningly sweet:  
  
""Happy Valentine's Day, babe.""  
  
They kissed passionately.  
  
They did the most intimate things imaginable in my apartment.  
  
They were going at it in my bathtub, water sloshing everywhere like my heart was being dragged through broken glass, blood seeping from every wound. I watched the neighbor girl laugh brightly, making cute poses with Rhett for the camera.  
  
""Today's me and Rhett's first Valentine's Day together! We're gonna have so many more!""  
  
She asked him with a giggle: ""Will living next door to you cause problems?""  
  
Rhett's face was flushed with alcohol as he pulled her closer.  
  
""Nah. Wren and I go way back‚Äîshe'd never suspect a thing. If I'm choosing to be with you, I'll protect you.""  
  
The video cut to the present, showing the girl crying while Rhett held and comforted her: ""Wren's just blunt‚Äîshe cares too much about me. Don't take it personally!""  
  
""I promise I won't touch Wren anymore!""  
  
""I'll save myself for you.""  
  
The girl sobbed in his arms: ""But she saw right through me! I was just standing there, and she already hated me.""  
  
""I wasn't trying to cause trouble‚ÄîI just wanted to see you, babe.""  
  
""What did I do wrong to deserve this?""  
  
I watched Rhett's face fill with sympathy as he soothed her: ""Don't worry. I'll spend the next few days with you.""  
  
The video ended abruptly.  
  
A message followed: \[Wren, think your wedding's still happening on schedule?\]  
  
My fingers went numb.  
  
The trembling crawled from my fingertips through my entire body until even my teeth were chattering. The love I'd been so proud of, the man I'd trusted completely, had just delivered the truth in the cruelest possible way.  
  
I forced myself to breathe to stay sane. I saved all the evidence and sent it to my best friend:  
  
\[Rhett and I are done.\]  
  
When I was sixteen, I caught my dad cheating with his secretary. When I confronted him through my tears, asking why he'd do this to us, he just threatened me not to tell my mom. He was so sure Mom would fall apart if she knew the truth.  
  
I didn't believe him. I ran to my mother, crying as I told her about Dad's betrayal.  
  
Later, my mom really did jump from our apartment balcony.  
  
I never had a mother again.  
  
That summer, I lost my mom and my dad. I became an outsider, shuffled between relatives who took me in out of obligation.  
  
Rhett was the one who stayed with me through it all.  
  
Rhett was the one who told me with absolute certainty:  
  
""Wren, even if you lose everything else, you'll always have me.""  
  
Now, Rhett‚ÄîI don't have you anymore either.  
  
I sat like a zombie in the coffee shop, watching my best friend point at the girl in the video and curse: ""This basic bitch isn't even that pretty! How the hell did she catch Rhett's eye? Remember when the actual school beauty was chasing him, and he wouldn't even look at her twice! How did he turn into this?""  
  
My friend got more worked up as she ranted, finally slamming her hand on the table.  
  
""I'm gonna find that bastard!""  
  
""This is such bullshit!""  
  
""That homewrecker basically moved in next door to mess with you‚Äîthere's no way we're taking this lying down!""
