It wasn’t that long ago—less than 3 years back.

I’m 33 now. I was 30 then, and he was 25.
Because of how I was raised, dating wasn’t really an option earlier—not unless I wanted drama. My mum’s nosy, my dad’s overprotective, and I watched what my siblings went through. So I waited. Then I left my country for a one-year postgrad course abroad—and for the first time, I had the freedom to try.

I joined the apps. I was nervous, overthinking  everything—who I’d meet, what would happen, how fast things might go. It wasn’t hard to get matches, but very few asked me out… until he did.

He was a young lawyer, Ivy League-educated, soft-spoken but smart, artsy, grounded. He felt familiar. When we messaged, it was easy. When he asked me out, I immediately said yes. 

We hugged at first sight. Walked together to a café and ended up talking for over two hours, even though we both had plans after. He walked on the roadside, opened doors, picked a quiet table. We kept ordering more coffee just to stay a little longer.

He asked about what I studied, what I cared about. I told him I write, I draw. He didn’t find it strange or intense (even my family knows that’s how I am)—he just listened and shared back. I’ve got lawyers in the family, so I could follow his world too. There was a sense of… ease. Familiarity. Or something idk. He felt like someone I’d made up when I was younger and finally stumbled across by accident.

We dated for about a month as things moved suddenly but gently. He knew it was my first time, and he didn’t push. But we got intimate after the 2nd. That first month, I came over to his family home when no one else was around. I think he liked having me there—maybe he liked the quiet rebellion of it, or maybe he just liked me.

*This is the moment I remember the most.*
We were curled up on his family’s new leather sofa, half-watching a movie, arms wrapped around each other. My head was on his chest, his head resting on mine. Then he shifted—lifted his head, looked at me for a few seconds, smiled. He kissed my forehead, pulled me in tighter. I smiled back. I remember everything: the feel of his jumper, the sound of his breath, his heartbeat, the scent of his hair and skin, the way he looked in the low light. That memory still undoes me. It always makes me cry.

Then something changed. I’d told him I’d talked about him online—not in detail, not by name, but enough to make him uncomfortable. He pulled back. Said he needed space and I respected that. But I didn’t see anyone else—just buried myself in school.

Summer came. He reached out. Said he missed me. So we met up again. Things felt normal, even warm. I cooked for him. He tried my food. Asked about my culture. It felt like we were heading somewhere.

Then he changed his mind. Said our age and culture gap were too big. That he couldn’t see a future. Said maybe we could just be FWBs instead.

He didn’t ghost me. I’ll give him that. But I wish he’d told me that it wasn’t going to go anywhere sooner. It would’ve been easier to decide how much to give. Instead, he waited three months, and I was already in too deep.

Still, I said yes. I told myself I wanted to explore, and maybe I actually did. But he got busy with work, and I got tired of waiting around. One day, I told him I had feelings for him. He seemed surprised—like it never occurred to him. That hurt most of all.

If he had just told me earlier—if he hadn’t let me believe we were building something real—maybe I wouldn’t have been so hurt. Maybe I’d still have felt something, but not like that. Not as deeply.

So I ended it. I told him I was in love with him. That I saw him for who he really was—messed up family, pain, all of it—and I didn’t judge him. I just accepted him. He told me I could find other guys just like him on the street. I didn’t have the words then—I was choking on tears.

We stayed in touch for a while. I even wrote him a birthday letter. Told him he was still the one. That he mattered—even if the world was full of versions of him, he was the one who left a mark. He said the letter was “nice” and once again, said men like him weren’t rare.

Dating after him was a mess.
– One tried to get me drunk to scam me.
– One hadn’t moved on from his ex.
– One just used me for sex and ghosted (even refused to call it that lol).
– One was too tired to hook up and blamed me for not initiating.
– One heard me rant about everything at Xmas, then still pushed for sex.
– The last one became my boyfriend.

He seemed kind, open, warm. Not the typical white-collar guy, but educated. I introduced him to my family. They liked him. Marriage was mentioned. We dated long distance for the most part because I returned home and we were together for about 1.5 years. But he lied to me—DM’d a girl for a hookup while I was with him that same Xmas. I broke things off soon after. Honestly, I think I had already emotionally clocked out by then. It helped he didn’t try too hard to make amends, I guess…

Every guy after my first ex hurt me somehow. But him? At least he told me the truth. Maybe it wasn’t kind, maybe it came too little too late—but it was still honesty. And weirdly, that meant something to me.

Since then, I’ve graduated, landed a good job. My siblings outed my dating life to my parents thinking it would cause chaos, but it didn’t—it actually brought us closer. And yet… I’m just scared to trust anyone again.

If I hadn’t met him, maybe I wouldn’t have walked into all the pain that followed. Maybe the good that’s happened since doesn’t quite make up for what I lost. Idk sometimes I just wish I had a guy friend I used to know and dated him instead. The apps may have poisoned the well long before I joined but it’s made everyone and everything feel jaded now.

And I’m tired.
Tired of wishing it didn’t happen.
Tired of remembering the good bits.
Tired of wondering if I’ll ever find anything like it again.
Tired of crying over it—even after a good day, even after feeling strong.
Tired of wanting connection in a world that makes it feel like a joke.

Sometimes I just wish God would end the pain. Quiet the noise.

But until then, I’m here. Still remembering. Still missing him.
And knowing—who I was with him, I’ll never be again.
And whoever comes next… they’ll always be measured against a memory.",1,1752290287.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

Two brands. One dreamed up by two locals who shared a passion for beer and history, the other a brain child of a millionaire wine maker from the heart of Napa Valley. One brand embraces the martime and working class history of its region and the other wanted to shed it. Only one could prevail. The name Savage and Cooke never really ment anything. If the curious patron inquired about its origins, they were told about the allure of its vissonary creator. If pressed further they might have been told they were names found on secret documents during the buildings renovation. Depending on the day of ones visit, they were brothers who worked on Mare Island. It's never really made clear when asked, but the genius and adroitness of its owner were reiterated. A man with a boutique coffee roaster, a winery, and a fried chicken restaurant on his vision board. Was the uncertainness of the future of the wine industry his downfall? Or maybe the delivery of historic ships to Mare Island Brewery clogged up the vision of his waterfront. In the end Savage and Cooke prepaired fried chicken in a makeshift trailer 4 days a week, while Mare Island Brewery grew it's two locations and added a third.

It was something his ex-wife did and when I did it he was triggered.  I agreed and would always rinse the cups out.  

A couple of years later on Christmas we were visiting our families.  At my family’s Christmas he called me by his ex-wife’s name in front of my family.  Our names have similar sounds.  Think Amy and Annie, but not actually those names.  I gave him a weird look and he apologized.  Later the same day at his family’s house, he called me by her name 3 more times.  The last time I snapped at him and said my name is ____!  His family heard and we were both embarrassed.  

When we got home he was extremely apologetic, but he had no explanation except that Christmas was a big holiday for the ex-wife.  I was still furious so when he went to bed I stayed up and plotted my revenge.  If he was going to call me by his ex-wife’s name, I would behave like her.  I brewed a full pot of coffee and pulled every mug out of the cabinet.  I made myself 22 cups of coffee with cream and put them all in the sink.  

The next morning I got up early, made a fresh pot of coffee to actually drink and waited until he got up.  When he walked into the kitchen and saw what I had done, he just looked at me, put his head down and started washing the mugs.

How do I move past this?","My husband took a job a couple years ago. We didn't discuss that the job included travel. The first couple times were hard when I was pregnant with a toddler, but now that we have a toddler and an infant (and a ten year old!), the trips feel IMPOSSIBLE. 

Since the birth of our son in December, my mental health has taken a swift decline. My ability to function degraded so quickly that my doctor sent me for an MRI of my head. We figured out that all of my symptoms were actually being caused by CPTSD. At my worst, I struggled to remember to eat/feed my kids, often failed to finish dressing, and would forget where I was going in the car, etc. 
The moment we figured out it was cptsd, I started a type of therapy called EMDR. It's working, but my therapist warned that I'd sometimes feel like it was getting worse before it got better. 
I'd like to also add in that our son was born by emergency induction followed by emergency C-section in December, then hospitalized for a week in the ICU in January. My mental decline started becoming noticable to others in April when my husband's family came to visit. The day I had my MRI (which they didn't know about), they sent my husband a long text detailing how messy our house was and how poorly looked after the children were. Our house was very overfull of family stuff. So, I worked with his mom to have a 17 cubic yard dumpster sent to our house, and I cleared out basically everything. I gave away furniture and clothing and toys and anything else we had excess of. My mother in law paid for the dumpster and even for a house keeper to come by to help tidy up. 
What I mean to say is that I am exhausted and I am trying VERY hard to get better, to feel good, to take care of myself so I can take care of my kids and enjoy my life. 

Therapy has been really doing something for me. I am a better mom. I have more energy. I'm even looking after what I eat and planning activities with my kids. But like my therapist said, it got worse before it got better... 

We started therapy, and it kind of picked open a bunch of emotions that had been pent up. While my husband was gone for a work trip in June, I had some kind of meltdown. My therapist said it was a panic attack. It had been 3 days of just me with our kids, and it had been going pretty well, until I had some kind of triggering situation with my daughter. As the panic attack reached its peak, I almost called an ambulance, because I couldn't stop imagining breaking glasses in my kitchen sink, or running my head over with our truck. It was so terrifying. I called my husband on FaceTime at about 11AM and he had been sound asleep in his hotel room. He did not say much as I sobbed and tried to calm down. He had just woken up and all I guess. He was scheduled to get home that night. I managed to get through the day without another incident. 
He got home that night. 
The next day, I had ANOTHER huge panic attack. I had gone to a doctor appointment for shoulder pain, only to find out at the desk that my husband had changed our insurance to a high deductible plan which we needed to meet before ANY medical costs were covered at all. I had a complete meltdown when I got home, just sobbing in my yard. My hands went numb, it felt like the world was going to end. I told my husband that I couldn't keep getting up and grinding through the day again and again and again. I took a hot bath. I tried to tell my husband that I needed help, more help than usual, maybe needed to be checked in somewhere this time. I laid in bed for a few hours and waited for... something. I felt like I needed to be taken care of. But eventually I just felt more like myself and managed to get up. 

Again, all of this to say that I am exhausted.

I worked on it in therapy five days later. That next morning, as I'm pouring my coffee, my husband says, ""Oh! I wanted to let you know--"" and I just held my hand up. Because I KNEW he was about to tell me he was going on another work trip. I said I know what you're going to say, give me a minute please. I stepped out of the room, drank some coffee tried to relax. I came out and asked him when he was leaving. He said two weeks. I told him it just seemed really callous to just bring it up SO casually when he knows how hard it is on me, and when he knows how badly it went last time. I asked him to please not tell my so casually. Please do some prep work, set up some grocery delivery for when you go, do anything at all to lighten the load, and that I was really hurt that he would treat it so casually. 

We talked about it again later that day and I said I just really didn't think it was a good idea at all. I said I didn't feel safe and I didn't feel like it was even safe for the kids, so I didn't get why he felt it was like an ""oh, by the way"" type conversation.

He got back from that trip late Wednesday night. My sister drove four hours to help me with the kids while he was gone, and she had left Wednesday afternoon when I left for therapy. My sister and I had a great time while she was here. She helped me get all the laundry washed and the lawn mowed.

The therapy really has been helping. I feel better able to take care of my kids without having my cptsd triggered. I have a lot of work to do still! But my diary entry yesterday was about hope. I am feeling good about myself and my ability to build myself up and shape my life how I want it. 

Today, after a long day out for errands and events with the kids, I was resting in bed. I had a headache and was drinking water and playing with a Lego set. My husband came in and said, ""Oh, good news, they want to send me somewhere else!!"" My stomach just fell to the floor. He started listing all the fun perks--the food, the city, the holiday amusement park activities he wants to check out, how it will be enriching because his favorite industry people are giving talks at this conference he's being sent to. I did a decent job smiling and trying to be excited for him, but like.... Is he for real? Why would he tell me like that? Like two weeks ago I was scared I was going to off myself, and now you're like ""teehee I'm so excited to do this again!!""? 

Can someone help me figure out how to get over this? 

A few minutes later I told him I didn't understand why he told me so casually again, since I had asked him to please tell me more gently next time. He said ""I thought it was different because it's later in the year"" (it's in October, which is also when he's going to another state for a wedding). 
I said I wasn't asking for an explanation, I was just telling him that I'm upset. 

How do I get over this? I tried journaling, taking a bath, texting my therapist, none of it helped. I came out and said that I'm not trying to ignore him but that I couldn't calm down. I said I want to talk about it but it feels pointless because the whole issue is that it feels like he doesn't hear me when I talk. So I went to bed with our baby. 

He adds so much to our family, but talking to him is like talking to a wall. He says ""I know"" and ""you're right"" and ""I'm sorry"", but will just repeat the same issue again later on. 

I'm so scared that as I continue therapy, I'm going to realize that this doesn't work for me, that I need a partner who can hear me when I plainly state my emotional needs.

I did receive a TapBlaze ID verification code by email (337 073), so clearly something is linked to my Gmail but when I contacted TapBlaze support several times, they said they couldn’t find my account and didn’t help further.

I’ve:
	•	Sent multiple emails
	•	Filled the contact form
	•	Commented on their Instagram
	•	Waited over 3 weeks with no proper reply

I really don’t want to lose my purchases and progress. Has anyone been able to recover their Good Coffee, Great Coffee data without the TapBlaze ID showing in the game?

Any help, advice or developer contact would mean the world 🥺☕💗
Thanks in advance!

27 Y F
My surgery is in exactly a month so today is literally my last day to vape. My doctor said I have to stop 30 days before. I just threw my vape out and I’m freaking out.

I smoked occasionally for 10 years but only got truly addicted about 3 years ago. It’s not just a little habit. It’s how I function. Coffee and vaping together are my favorite part of the day and honestly the only thing that makes me feel good. It’s also the only way I can really focus and work and make money.

I’m so scared that without it I won’t be able to work, won’t get anything done, won’t even feel like myself. I have severe ADHD and nicotine feels like the only thing that helps me function.

Also really afraid I’ll gain weight. I’m health conscious otherwise—this is literally my one vice. I know vaping is bad for me but it’s felt like my security blanket.

I’m also scared I won’t even be able to drink socially without it anymore, since I always vape when I drink.

Not sure how else to say it, but I really need support now. Please only kind words—I’m genuinely scared and don’t know how I’m going to do this.

Has anyone actually gotten off it and felt normal again? How did you work? How did you handle coffee without it? How do you not just go insane? Will I ever be able to drink socially again without it?

Frozen dew layered across bright, warm fallen leaves. A reminder of the season. The best season, not just for Halloween, but my birthday. My aunts and uncles found it weird that I was born so close to the “Devil’s Holiday”, but it never bothered me.  

After all, I wasn’t the curse. My Dad was. 

“Hey, Truman. Can you come down here?” A shock of fear snapped me awake. What did he need me to do now? How will I screw it up this time? 

“Truman, get your ass down here!” I jump out of bed and run down the stairs in my pajamas, to see my dad with his stained “Snap-on” shirt, pouring another cup of coffee. 	What were you doing?” He asked.  

“Sleeping in.” I responded.  

“Well, when I call for you, can please just, not wait?” He says, as he pours Jim Beam in his cup of coffee. “It’s pretty selfish.” He remarks, a dryness in his voice drowned out by the poison infused java.  

“Ok.” I responded. What else am I supposed to say? I was only 12. He towered over me. I couldn’t fight back, even if I tried.  Maybe being born into this family is the curse. 

“Ok, I need help holding the light. Trying to replace the oil pump, but I can’t see shit.” He demands. I oblige and head into the garage. The concrete floor was cold, but it didn’t sting as bad as the broken beer bottle I next stepped on. Dad saw me jump and wince at the pain. He jumped too. 

“The fuck?” He sharply remarked, until he looked down at the remains of the bottle, and the small drip of blood from my foot.  

“Oh. Watch your step.” He spoke. “Sorry, I gotta clean this place.”  

He said sorry? Thats a first.  

“I'll grab a band-aid really quick.” I remarked, until he quickly answered.  

“Nah, you’ll be fine. It’ll be super quick, I promise.”  

I quickly reach for some flip-flops by the door, and hurry over to the car. A 1984 Pontiac Fiero. What a piece of shit. Damn thing had no power, and an interior akin to a plastic Cronenberg film. Risking either an infection from the cut, or the wrath of my dad, I picked helping him. I didn’t need him ruining my day because I tried to put myself over him. 

“I got this new oil pan for this thing. Supposed to fix the fire risk these things were known for. The oil pan was too small on the original models, so when the things would overheat, some of that oil would seep out, hitting the exhaust manifold, causing the thing to ignite.” He droned. I’ve always been into cars, but I hated working with him. If it meant less time around him, the better.  

“So, I need you to help with getting this thing out. I don’t have much time before I gotta head to work, so I need you to hand me the right bolts while I'm down here, ok?” He asked. 

“Ok.” I responded, nonchalantly.  He flashed me a sour look. “Could you at least try and be a little interested? Christ.” He snapped. I walked over to the Snap-on drawer as he lowered himself under the jacked-up car. “Second from the top.” I opened it to a set of random wires and a tiny bottle of Jim Beam. Tried the one below it, and low and behold, the socket wrenches. Bastard can’t even remember his own tools. 

“Ok, hand me a socket extension, and...uhh...let's try a 10mm.” He asked. I looked and could only find a 9mm and a 12mm.  

“Uhh...there isn't a 10mm.” I said, shakily.  

“The fuck do you mean?” He snapped. 

“I only see a 9mm and a 11mm. No 10mm.” I responded. I could feel an ice-cold panic set in, just like whenever I helped him. It starts in the fingers, and quickly runs up your arms, until you’re shaking. It feels like having frostbite on a hot summer day. 

Dad sighs, fire in his breath. “Just give me the 11mm.” I grab the socket with the extender and click the 11mm onto it. My quivering hands lower to reach him. We lock eye contact.  

“You cold?” he asked, an ever-slight concern in his voice. I didn’t respond as I put the wrench into his hands.  

“You know, we could enjoy this if you weren't so scared all the damn time.” He responded.  

I didn’t care.  

I didn’t want to be with him. I didn't want him here at all. Not in this garage, this house, this street, this city, anywhere. I just want this bullshit done so he can go to work and leave me alone.  

Please, God. Just let him leave me alone.  

He grabbed the wrench from my hands, pulling it deep under the recesses of rust and wires. His arms were visible, as he motioned under the oil pan, connecting the extender to the oil pan’s bolt. He started turning the wrench, only to frustratedly whip the wrench out from under the car, smacking my bare toe. The sharp pain makes me flinch and gasp in pain.  

“You wouldn't have gotten hurt if you put on fuckin shoes. Now, give me the 10mm.” He snarled.  

“It-it-it's not there.” I responded, using all my strength to hold back tears.  

He let out a breath of fire and brimstone as he pulls himself out from under the car, gets to his feet as his drunken mass towers over me and comes closer.  

It all happened so fast I couldn’t even register it. A hairy arm whips forward, pushing me so hard i fell off my feet, landing right onto the workbench behind me, spilling his coffee and a toolbox. I fall to the floor; a hot cup of coffee smashed into the cold concrete floor, as polished chrome rods crash into my chest with a hundred thuds, followed by a big red box. He rips open the second drawer, small plastic bottle of alcohol flies out with some wires, as he pulls a small 10mm socket, buried deep within the drawer.  

He snaps a look back at me. I didn't have any strength left in me.  

So, I cried. It’s all I could do. 

Suddenly, the door to the house opens, and it’s a sight I've wanted to see all morning.  

“What was that noise?” My mom shouted.  

She walks over, seeing me on the cold hard floor in a puddle of tears. My foot’s covered in blood, with a red-cracked baby toe on top. A cacophony of Snap-On tools litter me, with a heavy red box smacking me right in my neck. My head in a pool of boozed-up coffee and tears. She gasps like her souls being sucked out, as she reaches down to help. 

“OH MY GOD, TRUMAN!” she shrieked, pulling me up from my bloody concrete-skinned hand. We met face to face, as she cradled me in the warmest hug I've felt in a long time. Whether from the crisp autumn morning, or from the frigid fear I've felt from the sick Bacchus I was helping. 

“If he just would've listened, I wouldn't have to clean this up.” He quietly snapped. 

“If you weren't such a drunk BASTARD, he wouldn't have hurt himself to begin with.” Mom fired back. She helped me get back in the house, picking up the broken shard and throwing it in the garbage right next to it.  

“Wait, honey.” He replied, placing a hand on her shoulder. She let go of me just a second to whip her hand out and smack him so hard in the face he fell, collecting the Pontiac’s plastic side mirror on his way down.  

“You fuckin-” he tried to mutter. 

“We. Are. Done.” she responded, as she motioned me into the house, slamming the door so hard, a picture fell off the wall. Our family portrait.  

Everything after that was a blur of stinging pain and yelling. Mom kept me in the living room, nursing my wounds with a pack of ice and Band-Aids as yelling persisted. I don’t remember what was said. All I remember was it ending with dad taking his shitcan of plastic and depression, cranking it over, and driving off into the unknown. Tires chirping as the 90 horsepower’s of shame tried leaving marks on the old Detroit pavement.  

Then, mom came inside. Immediately, she picked up the home phone, calling grandpa. He knows his son’s tendencies, and how abusive he can be. This isn’t the first time he’s crossed the line. Only the second. Previously, it was over me being bullied at school. Mom wasn’t home from work yet. Instead of showing sympathy, he screamed at me over dinner for half an hour, calling me a disgrace and “fucking useless.” Thankfully, she did end up coming home, causing me to rat him out right to their faces, leading to a verbal scuffle, and dad running off.  

Grandpa called, hooked us up with a divorce lawyer and that was nearly it. No more fear, tears, anxiety, or feeling like I'm never good enough. But then, when he came home, he had a family meeting, or as I'd like to call it, “A damn good performance.” 

Pleading to us over and over how it’ll never happen again. He’ll stop drinking, spending money, and treating us like garbage. Mom didn’t 100% believe it, grandpa wanted to believe it, but I did. The lawyer was called off, and our new life began. For a week. Then this incident happened. I know better now. What he did to us, to our family, will never happen again. I just remember sitting on the couch, staring at the door, waiting for him to step through that door, like deja vu.  

But he never did. The sunset cased through the trees, an aura of golden hues lighting the living room like a movie set, falling below the horizon as the day fades to black.  

And nothing. Just a dull ringing filling my ears, waiting for Dad's old Pontiac to fill the void. I ended up sleeping there.  

“Are you ready for bed, sweetheart?” Mom asked. The clock on the wall struck 9:00.  

“I... I don’t know.” I replied. Mom sat beside me.  

“Waiting for him to come back, right?” she asked.  

“I just... Dad always plays these games. He sets us up for something good, and just...” I trailed off. 

“He just rips the rug out from underneath you?” She filled in the blanks. Thats what dad was best at. Setting you up for a fall, so he can revel in it. Thats all he’d ever done to me. Whenever I accomplished something great, he’d always come and shoot it down. A 95% on the final exam, a silver in cross-country, a date to the school dance. All of these met with the typical answer:  

“Thats it?” 

And he would just look at me, waiting for my reaction.  

But him leaving us, finally? That would be a real treat. But I couldn’t just accept that this is it. I felt the need to wait for him to open the door and pull the rug out from under my feet. Maybe waiting for him to come back, like I'm able to predict the rug pull, will make the impact sting less.  

But he never came home that night. 

“Can I just sleep here?” I asked mom. She nodded. “Sure. Want me to bring you down a comforter?” She asked. I nodded, as tears began to well back up. She hugged me, as I released the pain, the peril, and the stinging memory of what happened earlier. Tears grew to sobs. 

Why can’t he just disappear? Permanently?  

Chapter 2 

I don’t remember much of that night. No dreams, or images playing through my head. Typically, if something traumatic happened, it would play through my head like a VHS tape you didn’t have to rewind. The sounds, the images, all loop over and over. But that night, I didn’t see anything. I could just feel the warmth of my blanket, shielding me from the cold October night. However, I couldn't even trust the NASCAR comforter I wrapped so tight around me. 

My back started to get warmer, as if an electric furnace was facing my back. The growing heat crept through my skin, penetrating my spine until my chest felt soothing warmth. Felt good. That is until the heat got brighter. It stopped feeling like a furnace and started to feel more eternal. Something primordial. It grew from gentle warmth to glowing heat. I tried to move, but I couldn't. The heat grew into a searing pain, illuminating my back, and digging into my bones. I can still feel my comforter wrapped around me like a cocoon, pinning my arms into my burning chest. Suddenly, the heat flash overed, consuming my body. I couldn't move, open my eyes; I couldn't even cry for help. For my mom, or anyone. All I could do was watch faded embers of bright light pierce through my eyelids, like an x-ray. An infinite fire alight across my helpless body, eating away at my flesh as embers fall into a seeming abyss in front of me. My eyes open for just a second, to see nothing but a burned, charred body, flashing a glance at me. Seared lips, cauterized with dried, smoking blood, cracks open for just a flash to echo a word into what's left of my broiling soul. 

“I’m sorry.” 

Then I'm shook awake.  

“TRUMAN! BABY, WAKE UP!” my mom cried, pulling my blanket off, revealing my sweat-soaked pajamas.  

“Did you have a nightmare?” she asked. I nodded, tears welling up. She hugs me, pulling me tight as I recalled the subconscious horror.  

“What time is it?” I faintly asked. “Half pass 6.” She replied. “You gotta get to school in an hour. If you want, we can talk about your nightmare? Hopefully it helps?”  

She told me that dreams can reveal things from your subconscious. I’ve never really talked about them before, but this felt important. I’ve never been burned before, and yet this all felt so real. We spent the next hour talking about it over pancakes and “coffee”, which was mostly creamer for me. 

“I haven't heard back from your father. I’ll give your grandpa a call in a bit.” 

I nodded. I finished my mug of hot Coffee Mate and as I headed up stairs to get dressed, mom popped a question: 

“Maybe you had that dream because of a scary movie dad had you watch?” 

He did that a lot. The Thing, The Fly, Fire in The Sky (that one film where all the aliens look like Joe Biden), all that stuff. 

I nodded no. There was a copy of Final Destination 3 on the counter though. 

“If he showed you the tanning bed scene, I'm skinning him alive.” mom said. 

Chapter 3 

I walked through the old, blue painted doors into the main foyer of this decrepit place. Blue and yellow stripes line walls, covered with trophy cabinets and old photos. The smell of old books, floor cleaner and the swimming pool just down the hallway could pierce through any antidepressant. Getting to my first class, I'm met with the same old classmates I've known all trimester, with the same three guys in the back of the class. A skinny, tan-skinned guy, a fat, dark-haired guy and a bald one. The one person I'd still call a friend, but every now and again the other two would be nice. They were really the only people who talked to me. That’s alright.  

“Maaaan, you look like shiiit!” the fat one said. “Parker!” The teacher snapped. 

I shot a glance at him.  “Go to hell.” I snapped.  

“TRUMAN!” The teacher snapped back, as the whole class lightly gasped.  

I took my assigned seat at the back, right next to the three. Wish Parker wasn't as much of an asshole like he used to be.  

“ooooOOOOO, Truman swooooooore!” Parker said, under his breath. I didn’t pay attention to him as the skinny one nudged him, shooting a glance.  

“Rough night's sleep?” The skinny one asked. “Yeah, Issac.” 

“You should take some melatonin, dude.” The bald one asked. 

“Nah Ryan, it's not that.” I rebutteled. “Just more family bullshi-crap. Crap.” 

God, let today be over.  

Suddenly, the teachers phone rings. “Hello?”  

We all sit in silence. “Ok, I'll tell him. Truman, your mom’s here to pick you up.” 

The entire class erupts into “ooooOOOOOs” like I got in trouble, as I grab my things and head out. “Awww, what happened to your dad now?” Parker jokingly snapped. 

The entire class stops. Dead silence, and deadpan looks at him.  

“Go. To. HELL.” I said, walking out as everyone, including the teacher, eyes Parker, followed by everyone barking at him, calling him an asshole.  

I walk to the office, with my mom waiting in the doorway. Tears were in her eyes.  

“What happened? Is it-?” I trailed off.  

She nodded, yes.  

“Dad’s leaving?” I asked.  

“No, he’s...passed.”  

My heart froze as I hugged my mom, hoping she’d warm me back up.  

Is it finally over?  

I let go, only to look behind me and see, who else but Parker, presumably getting sent down here after what he said.  

He looked at me like a sad puppy, full of guilt. I shot a look back of scorn. He just dipped his head, and walked away, as if he wanted to say sorry, but knew it wouldn't do anything.  

Chapter 4 

The funeral home was packed. Aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews I haven’t seen in years line the walls, leading to the casket of my dad’s charred remains. I didn’t cry. Just walked up to the closed casket, placed my hand on it, and searched for whatever reason I could find to mourn. Couldn't find any. I felt like a cold-blooded psychopath in a room of sobbing people. Why should I cry? Why let out a single tear after years at the hands of a drunk bully?  

All of a sudden, my hands began to burn. The top of the casket felt like a hot skillet, leaving behind a sting, but nothing else. I turned my hands over to see pale skin, and nothing else.  

“Are you ok?” Mom asked.  

“I’m fine.” I answered, slightly skewed in shock and confusion.  

“Well, let's wrap things up and get some ice cream, alright? Shouldn’t be too much longer. Bout’ half an hour.” she assured me. I nodded and let out a slight smile. Mom never let me down.  

We got home five hours later. It was about six o’clock, and thankfully we agreed to cremation. Not like there was much to bury anyways. I shed out of my dreadful black suit, threw on some Corvette pajamas and a Dale Earnhardt shirt, about to run with mom through the McDonalds drive-thru for a hot fudge sundae, when out of nowhere, the doorbell rang.  

“Hey, Mrs. Fields! Is Truman home?” That’s Issac. As happy as I was to see them, that also means that- 

“Yeah, I wanted to come by and apologize.” Aaaand that's Parker. Damnit. Well, hopefully he’s a man of his word.  

I come downstairs to see the guys. Issac, Ryan, and... Parker. 

“Hey, man. Look, I-I'm sorry for what I said.” Parker said.  

“We just wanted to stop by and make sure you’re doing alright.” Issac said.  

“Well, we were just going to run down to McDonalds for some ice cream, if you guys wanted to come with?” Mom asked, which was met with gasps and “Hell yeah’s”.  

Suddenly, we heard a loud, muffled crash from the garage. We all froze. 

Honey, could you go check that out? I need to grab my purse.” Mom asked. “I'll come with!” Parker insisted.  

We walked through the door to the mudroom, just outside the garage, when Parker stopped me.  

“Hey, so. Look, I don’t know what it’s like to lose someone close like that. So, I don’t fully understand what it feels like. I know I’ve been a bit of a dick these past few months, and that was probably the last thing I should've done.” Parker explained. 

Well, it's certainly better than just “Sorry.” I stare at him as he continued. 

“Just...whatever I can do to make it up to you, I'll do it. I’m just...really sorry. Even if saying it isn't enough, I’m just really really sorry. Can we still be friends?” 

I was shocked. I just nodded and said: “We’ll see.”  

“Ok, then one last thing. Why did you keep your dad’s car?” 

I froze. “What do you mean?” He shot me a confused look, only to point out through the window in the door, a melted, charred, automotive carcass.  

Slowly, I opened the door, walking into a room filled with the smell of rotting metal and burned plastic. The tires were liquified wrapped around corroded wheels, sagging into the pavement. The bumpers, fenders and quarter panels were all dried, melted, and gray goo.  

 The bare chassis was all that remained of what once was a Fiero.  

My dad’s Fiero. And I could tell by the seared pieces of bones and a wedding ring, sitting in the remains of the footwell.  

“It’s been two weeks since the accident. How...?” 

I was frozen. Couldn't say a word as Parker walked around the corpse.  

“Heh, almost as if he-” he trailed off. “Never mind.” He finished, as he walked to the front.  

“That’s odd.” He added. “What?” I muttered. “Well, despite all the damage, for some reason, the front bumper looks...fine?” Parker said, as he leaned in front of the remains. 

He wasn’t wrong. It looked brand new. Polished, waxed, fresh. I started walking towards the door, trying to get my mom when suddenly, the smell of burnt metal began emanating towards the door, followed by a metal click. The door locked itself. The smell dissipated.  

Then, the wheels began to turn.  

Melted rubber slowly cracked and creaked as the rims rotated forward, inching further and further. 

It spooked Parker. He pushed against the bumper, stopping it. “Ha! Nice try-” He stopped noticing me by the door. “You’re not pushing it?” He asked. His voice was cold as mine. I nodded no. Then the wheels began turning again. Stronger. He started pushing back, falling backwards onto the wall as the Fiero inched closer and closer. I try and pull on the b-pillar, only to burn my hands in the process. Like on the casket. 

“Hey, man get me out of here. I don-” He was cut off by the sound of crunching plastic pinning his shins into the wall. He yelled in pain as the grille slid forward. I ran over, grabbing his arms, pulling with all I could. Amidst the skirmish, we both looked down. 

The grill was opening like a mouth. A slow, loud gasp of air emanated from the vehicle as suddenly, an earth-like snap made Parker fall to his knees. A powerful suction grew from the grill, now a gaping maw, as his shins snapped in half before collapsing into the vent. I grabbed tightly onto him as I looked back at the car.  

It was growing from the bumper, forming a new, shiny red hood as the vent consumed his legs up to his knees.  

Then, it stopped.  

Parker, now a sobbing mass of blood and tears on the floor, looks on. “WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS?!” He screamed from the depths of his soul.  

Just beyond the hood, in the tattered remains of the interior, a small green light grew, reflecting onto the bare metal bodywork. The aftermarket CD player turned on.  

“If I could tuuuurn back time. If I could find a way...” faintly booms over ruined speakers. It was one of dad's favorite songs.  

Then, the engine turned on.  

An explosion of noise rocked the car, now half-way formed, followed by a red, warm mist rocketing out of the rear, like a geyser, covering the entire garage door. We didn't have long to look, because then, Parker was ripped out of my hands, falling into the gaping maw with a deafening shriek.  

The cracking of bones and cartilage rang through the cooling vents, running into the mid-engined grinder. I grab onto what's left of his hands as he’s consumed all the way to his chest. The middle divider of the front grille sliced into his abdomen, parting him like a saw, as his face grew ghostly white. I could only hold onto his hand for so long, until with one big, metallic creak, he was consumed. His arm shooting into the car like a twig into a woodchipper, followed by a red explosion of steamy, hot mist, rained across the garage, covering everything, from the family portrait to posters from Hot Rod magazine, the Snap-On tool bench; everything, in what remained of Parker.  

I looked down at my hands, my clothes, the ground, and everything. Before I had a second to react, I slipped. My head smacked the wall behind me, as I fell to the floor with a hard thud. The door bursts open. 

“Truman, what happened?” Mom asks, before looking up, and shrieking like I've never heard before. I look up to see a perfectly clean garage. No blood, no damage, no Parker. All with a shiny, red Pontiac Fiero, sitting right in the middle of it.  

A muffled song can only be heard booming from the interior.  

“If I could tuuuurn back time...” 

 

Epilogue 

“Hey, Kenny! This is for scrap?!” a man asks, standing next to a red Fiero. 

“Yeah, I dunno whats wrong with it, but whoever dropped it off was dead set on it getting crushed.” Kenny replies. “Something about a fire risk?” He finished. 

“Got the keys?” The man asks.  

“Yeah, just a second.” Kenny replies, walking into the main office of the scrapyard.  

The man walks to the driver side door, only to see its unlocked. He hops in, taking a look. “Jesus Christ, this thing’s perfect!” A shiny, black dash next to pristine, maroon leather seats, and a four-speed manual he’s able to click right into gear.  

“This thing’s...getting crushed?” He mutters to himself.  

“Yeah, apparently!” Kenny pops up, startling the man.  

“Dude. I’m taking this. This can NOT be crushed.” He says, being handed the keys. He puts them into the ignition, turns it over, and the engine roars to life.  

\- 

“Yeah, they just let me take it home!” He says, after pulling the car into his garage.  

“Ok, Tom. Just make sure whatever fire risks are fixed.” The friend over the phone says.  

“I’m gonna look around. Something has to be wrong with it.” He says.  

“Take it easy.” He finishes, as he closes his phone, leaving only him, the Fiero, and a strange noise emanating from the car.  

He pops the rear hood, looking around for the source of the noise, only to find a soft, glowing light from around the corner of the engine bay. The catalytic converter was glowing hot.  

“That’s...fuckin weird. I’m only a mile away from work.” He mutters to himself as he pulls his head out from the engine bay. He grabs two bricks to block the front wheels as he jacks up the rear. Pulling his creeper underneath, the sound grows into a moaning. He starts to undo the oxygen sensor, then the bolts attached to the Catalytic Converter, until the whole piece comes off the exhaust.  

Walking towards the tool bench, the piece of exhaust is glowing red, vibrating, and now smoking hot as he sets it down to grab some welding gloves.  

Looking down the center pipe, all he can see is a glowing red face.  

“Your turn.”  

Within the blink of an eye, his entire body is sucked into the pipe.

I'm relatively new to Hackintosh, but I have prior experience with multiboot setups and general OS installations. I've successfully installed macOS Ventura on both my Lenovo M720q desktop and X280 laptop with full Intel iGPU acceleration.

Recently, I picked up a Lenovo M920t and managed to install macOS Sequoia. The install went through fine, but I'm currently stuck with only 7MB VRAM and no proper Intel graphics acceleration. After logging in, the desktop goes white—no wallpaper shows—and the system becomes sluggish, which I suspect is due to missing or incorrect GPU configurations.

I can see the wallpaper briefly at the login screen, but once logged in, it turns white. I've tried device-id spoofing, followed the Dortania guide, attempted framebuffer patching, but no luck so far.

I've attached my system specs, current EFI folder, and relevant screenshots for reference. Apologies for the long post and all the attachments—just trying to provide everything that might help.

Appreciate any guidance you can offer!

Thanks in advance!

Let me break down each major island to help you decide which paradise fits your style.

Oahu - The Gathering Place
Perfect for first-time visitors who want a mix of everything. You'll find bustling city life in Honolulu, iconic Waikiki Beach, historic sites like Pearl Harbor, and plenty of shopping. The North Shore offers a more laid-back vibe with world-famous surf spots.

My absolute favorite experience on Oahu was taking a doors-off helicopter tour. Seeing the island from above gave me a whole new perspective - from hidden waterfalls to the stunning Ko'olau mountains. I booked through this link (https://athometouch.com/Honolulu) and it was worth every penny. The aerial views of Diamond Head and Pearl Harbor were unforgettable.

Maui - The Valley Isle
Choose Maui if you're seeking a balance between development and natural beauty. The Road to Hana, Haleakala National Park, and pristine beaches make it perfect for adventurers who still want comfortable amenities. Great for honeymoons and romantic getaways.

Big Island - Hawaii
This island is for nature lovers and those fascinated by active volcanoes. It's less developed than Oahu or Maui but offers unique experiences like night manta ray diving, coffee farm tours, and watching lava flows. The climate zones here are incredibly diverse.

Kauai - The Garden Isle
The most tropical and pristine of the main islands. If you're looking to escape crowds and immerse yourself in nature, Kauai's your spot. The Napali Coast, Waimea Canyon, and lush forests make it a hiking paradise.

Some practical tips for choosing:
- Consider flight costs and connections
- Think about your must-do activities
- Factor in travel time between spots
- Check weather patterns for your dates
- Consider your comfort with different levels of development

For first-timers, I usually recommend Oahu. It's easy to navigate, has excellent infrastructure, and offers something for everyone. Plus, those helicopter tours I mentioned earlier give you an incredible overview of the island's diversity. They regularly sell out though, so book early if you're interested.

Bottom line: There's no ""wrong"" choice - each island has its own magic. But matching the island to your travel style will make your Hawaiian vacation even more special.

1lxpjh8,https://www.reddit.com/r/RestlessLegs/comments/1lxpjh8/finally_some_relief_after_26_years_but_with/,"Finally some relief after 26 years, but with side-effects","Hello Reddit, I thought I would share my experience with RLS in case it would help someone. Also if anyone has any advice/feedback that would be appreciated too :)

I'm a 38 year old male and have had RLS since I was 12. Starting around when I turned 30 is when it became unbearable and moved to my arms and chest on a nightly basis. I spent years powering through at work by taking 20 min naps in my car and drinking unhealthy amounts of coffee.

I've been on various treatments throughout the years with not many benefits which includes (in order):

\-Mirapex/Pramipexole: bad side effects including increased risk-taking along with attitude changes

\-Gabapentin and later Pregabalin - didn't work that well, it also lowered my IQ especially around spatial reasoning, this was a no-go for me working in data and computer science jobs

\-Carbidopa-Levodopa: Similar side-effects to Mirapex. It would leave my legs but I would still get it in left arm and sometimes chest. Also had what felt similar to an alcohol hangover in the morning.

\-Kratom: This worked better than any of the other options, but was short-lasting. I would take 2-3 grams before bed before waking up at 3AM where I would take another 1.5 grams. I would feel a weird slight hangover from it but was definitely better than not getting any sleep.

After this my neuro categorized my condition as being ""refractory"" and had me try Tramadol 50 mg. This was ineffective so she upped it to 100 mg, which like the kratom was effective for a short period of time and I would get it again between 2-3AM every night.

We then switched to methadone 5mg 3 months ago which was the first drug that worked and nearly completely rid me of RLS. I would still get it a couple nights/week but it was mild and I could walk it off after 10 minutes and it wouldn't return, it wasn't worth upping the dosage. Unfortunately this made me feel sedated and depressed all the time and I didn't have much energy.

My neuro then referred me to a pain clinic where we switched to OxyContin 10mg. It is shorter lasting and effective, though the current dose is a little low and I still get mild symptoms every night (we are planning on gradually upping this soon). This option is not as long-lasting as the methadone but I still have some low energy and depressed (though not as bad as the methadone). I'm not sure if it is entirely from this as I have had other stressful issues come up such as working long weeks w/o a vacation along with a couple of other stressful events that could be contributing to that too and causing burnout.

After sharing this info with my doctor he is having me get my testosterone levels checked next week and wants to start exploring injections. 

I am staying cautiously optimistic that we are on the right track and just hoping I get my energy back soon.

[No budget],"I just took delivery of a Profitec Go from Whole Latte Love and, a little too late, I discovered that the rubber hose that connects the reservoir to the pump had a tiny rupture, which may have led to a damaged pump. It also leaked water everywhere, but that isn't the issue. While I'm not too worried about finding a replacement hose at a good plumbing supply company, I AM worried about any damage this may have caused the pump. Ya see, I set it all up in accordance with the instructions and then, in accordance with the manual, I let it run for ""at least 30 seconds until water is being dispensed from the brew group before pressing the coffee button again to stop filling the boiler."" It was loud -clearly the result of cavitation in the pump, which was straining to pull in water through a leaky hose. I incorrectly allowed the pump to operate dry for approximately 45 seconds before it finally pulled in enough water (against the leaky tube) to stop straining. In hindsight, I realized that the abnormally loud pump noise was due to cavitation, which I know can result in damage.

Should I demand a replacement pump or a whole new machine under warranty? Or just replace the hose and hope for the best?

1lxpdoi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskGaybrosOver30/comments/1lxpdoi/i_have_a_crush_on_my_friend_but_he_is_straight/,"I have a crush on my friend but he is straight, what should I do?","**Hi everyone, this is my first time posting here, because the past six months have been really difficult for me. I’m hoping to hear some advice or thoughts from you all.**



I think I have a kind of *physical attraction* toward my friend. Every time I see him, I feel this strong urge to hug him, to get close to him—even smell his scent (and yes, sometimes I have even more intimate thoughts). But I’ve always kept those feelings to myself.



I’m 30, he’s 26. There’s something about him that feels so adorable and dependable. I love eating with him, hiking together, city walking—honestly, even just grabbing a coffee with him brightens my whole day. No exaggeration: spending time with him can wash away all the tiredness I carry.



But in our group chat, he’s made it clear that he’s “male, straight, and into women.” There are three of us in the group—me, him, and a woman who used to be our colleague. We all worked at the same company before but have since moved on. The three of us still meet up occasionally, usually with the female friend driving us around to eat, hang out, or do things together.



Most of my interactions with him are limited to the group chat. He rarely talks to me one-on-one, and even when I message him privately, the conversations are short. Most of our communication happens in the group, where we joke around or share memes from the internet. But even just chatting with him there makes me happy.



I keep trying to find signs—any small clue—that maybe he likes me back, but it’s hard to find any. And it often leaves me feeling frustrated and hopeless. I’ve broken down and cried at night more times than I can count because of my feelings for him.



Not long ago, I lost my job and went on a solo hike in the desert. After coming back, I brought him some local specialties from the cities I passed through. But he ended up sharing them with our female friend instead, which hurt me deeply. It made me feel like, in his eyes, I’m nothing more than just “a buddy from the group chat.”



I’ve tried expressing my affection in other ways—carefully picking out birthday gifts, bringing him coffee at work, treating him to nice meals. I’ve done everything I could think of to show him how much I care.



A while back, we had a disagreement because of that local gift situation. I was upset, so I visited a scenic spot the two of us once went to together, and I even posted about it on social media to show how much I missed those happy moments. But he saw the post and didn’t respond at all.



I think he knows how I feel, but he chose to respond in his own way—by sticking to group settings and keeping things light, as if to say:

**“Do you like me?”**

**“No—we’re just bros.”**



And that hurts. Sometimes I can’t stop myself from crying. I’m getting older, and I’ve never been in a relationship. The idea of purely liking someone with all my heart seems to get harder as the years go by. Whenever I think about that, I feel even more hopeless and sad about my life.

I am 21F and my boyfriend 22F we're dating for 2 years and me and him were planning our honeymoon before we get married I was thinking of white modern with a tall cake and we already had invite list I invited my friend, my family, and including my stepsister in which my husband looked kind of scared. that should've been my first red flag, but his face quickly changed. while we were planning our honeymoon next, I was thinking that we went on a little vacation downtown somewhere to a cottage that I was gonna rent. he agreed and we end up putting the date for March 7 two days. But a few days ago before we made the plan I saw him sneaking out the house when I was fake sleeping because he's been sus lately. And I saw him get his car and drive off. I really thought he was just going to see his parents or go out for something, but that should've been my my first red flag, but it wasn't because I was too tired when the day came for my wedding, I was in my perfect in my white dress that I've been saving up on ever since last year with the money I got from being a waitress and cleaning up offices for a living. I finally got the dress I've been wanting for. As me and my groom jack if I didn't say his name before. Walk down the aisle together, holding hands when we made it to the platform. Suddenly, the door burst open with a crying child, my twin sister with a glare, but it wasn't at me. It was at Jack. He stared at her scared and panicked. She walked in carryinga girl that probably 2 years old actually she screamed you bastard you left me with your dumb child and now you want to get married she screamed. Everyone turned around and gasp at this. She was stomping now as her child was behind her crying and she kepttalking,""Sophie. You took everything away from me because you always were smarter than me and more pretty!""the baby now, crying harder as she tagged. I stared at my husband, the cheating, scumbag and said is this true Jake he stuttered trying to say no, but it caught in his throat and that's when I just gave up. I threw the flowers on the floor and stomped on them before storming out of that place pushing Jessica in the process before storming out of the venue mad as the devil he tried to run after me, but he tripped and fell. As people were helping him up and also looking at the disaster. Wow when I made it home, I slammed the door and locked it and crashed into bed, since he wanted to cheat on me, I'm gonna make both of their lives hell. The next day I started gathering evidence of the cheating and fraud. See my sister used to be an influencer with her beauty until one day somebody assaulted and ruined her face so when she finally found a job as a office cleaner when she was doing her knife shifts, she took money from out the cash register and slipped them in her pocket when she was cleaning and she did it every day until the company went downhill and no more money was coming, so she just quit. She didn't answer that she started hunting for husbands until she found mine and while I was still dating him had an affair and then after he left when she took a test, she was pregnant and when she told him he was shocked and also scared told her to abort the baby, but she said no and said that she's keeping the baby and that he better pay child support but then he said abort. The child I already with someone and she just lost it started spamming him started calling him until he blocked her number and she just gave up until she gave birth found out that I  was getting married today and so happened to break down the door before I kiss someone who was kissing somebody else's lips after I got her keys, I went to go to my boyfriend's case I found out that he did fraud too, but by stealing from his manager at a coffee shop until he got fired for being rude to a customer. So that's how they got together I said to myself. After building both cases, my husband and my sister, both for the building cases about me and fake news. Saying that I was a fraud mentally unstable and makes up lies as the Photoshop images together of me acting crazy and me holding a baby doll that I never had. They wanted to ruin me so they can get together since he apologized to his baby girl, so I was making sure the hell had a special place with them when they die and then my lawyer called me saying that we had a meeting with Jessica and my husband, Jack when I got there the court hearing was already starting. They started making fake announcements about how I was mentally ill. I had done fraud and then I was and I was crazy and they probably thought that making a random court hearing will probably get me jail time because you think I never had evidence but then I brought out my detective and my papers of what they done and flatten them out on the paint table and then I started reading them Jessica fraud, has stole from her office multiple times until she left because it went downhill Jack fraud, stole money from his job as a coffee worker got fired for yelling at a customer. The judge looked astonish and astonishment, turned to anger as he turned to the both of them your claims have been dismissed. You both for spin five years in prison for fraud and false report. As they walked away with handcuffs, Jessica looked at me one more time with a serious glare that can kill ghost and now that I'm posting this right now, I'm happy that they're still in jail. I'm 23 now living in my own apartment and they'll be getting out of jail in two years probably less that they keep acting good. Hopefully they don't come back to kill me or report me again hopefully I'm safe.

1lxpaw9,https://www.reddit.com/r/barista/comments/1lxpaw9/thats_a_dopio_pointing_to_ice_breve_latte/,“That’s a dopio” pointing to ice breve latte.,"Okay, folks, I finally got one. A customer who threw off my day. I’m usually pretty chill when a customer comes in and wants some bastardized coffee and calls it a regular coffee name, but this one nearly broke my patience (and I’ve worked with kids of all ages and surgeons. I’ve been told I’m quite patient). 

I had a patient order “two iced dopios to go.”It’s been unusually hot here this week, so we’re icing a lot of drinks. Shots on ice aren’t uncommon for my area. I pull down two 8oz to-go cups, ice down shots in each. She asks for half & half. I grab the half & half and ask “big splash or little?” and she says “well, fill it up…” and then looks at the cup and says “is that the biggest cup you have?”

By now, I’m confused, so I stop and think for a second and say “no… what cup size would you like?” She gets a bit miffed at my open ended question, and so I pull down a 12oz cup to show her, and she says “yes, that’s better”. I switch cups, and she says “well, fill that one up.” I kinda take a moment to keep my face less perplexed and then turn back to her and ask “you want two shots and ice and then filled with half & half?” She says “yes, a *dopio*” in this tone that lets me know she thinks I’m an idiot, emphasizing “dopio” as though I didn’t hear her correctly before. 

I filled the cups up with half & half, set them on the counter and go to ring her out. She took one sip, set it back down and said “yes, that’s a dopio” as though she was relieved we finally reached the end. 

I rang her out for two 12 oz breve lattes and she paid and left. She got a receipt, and in my mind I imagine her showing someone the receipt all upset and that person tells her she’s an idiot. Imagining this, even if it’s very unlikely to occur or in any way change her habits, just makes me feel better. Her tones and body language were so gross and got worse throughout the interaction. 

This is one reason I like to make drinks before charging on slow days, especially when it’s just me behind the counter. Two shots on ice is far different in price than a 12oz breve latte on ice. ",10,1752287161.0,barista,3,1.0,False

Hello everyone 

I am writing this to just give a level of perspective and maybe to give a bit of hope to some out there. 

2 years ago I got out of a 3 year long relationship and it destroyed me. It took me about a year before I decided I wanted to at least put myself out there cause after my first relationship ended I just shut myself off from any romantic potential for like 5 years so I didn’t  want to do that again. 

I started on just bumble and only bumble and I would try my best to just match with a girl I found physically attractive then talk to her if I also found her attractive and pleasant in terms of personality. I’m not gonna say every date was great but none were horrible just some girls were awkward sometimes I was awkward and simple most of them we just didn’t match up and that’s fine. It’s not realistic for everyone to actually fuck with you. 

Then for those saying I can’t even get a date. This is obviously gonna be a bit different for all 
, but I don’t think of myself as a super attractive guy but also I don’t think I’m butt fucken ugly. Sometimes I would go weeks dry on the apps and sometimes I would get a decent bit of action in terms of matching with girls and talking with them, but it definitely wasn’t like I was getting matches all the time, which I hear is kinda common for even objectively attractive guys. BUT it’s doable man just try on your profile, and what I mean by that is decent pics that just show what you actually look like cause that is the main advertisement on dating apps. Your face.

Then on dates the first few i definitely tried to almost put up a persona that i figured my date would like but thats exhausting. After a while i just started being me. Openly awkward and because of that kinda funny (imo) but fr just be you (only if you aren’t objectively just ass) cause that’s who they gotta get to know to decide if they wanna date.

Also putting in effort as a date is not hard just decide something, a time and place and tell them. If they fucken hate it I think they will tell ya, but I kept it causal just coffee and talking to see if we can even hold a conversation. ( Guys for real the bar is so dam low for men, the bare minimum  will put you above a lot of these guys out there)

I will end with just saying it doesn’t have to be as horrible as people say it generally is. Good people still are out there just use solid judgment on the apps and actually know what ya want. If ya wanna fuck act accordingly. If ya want an actual relationship act accordingly.


Oh almost forgot met my great gf like 6 month ago and been dating for 4 months so far but it’s going super well and I hope that for all of you too. ",1,1752286809.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

1lxp37e,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ruleshorror/comments/1lxp37e/im_a_toll_collector_at_a_highway_in_louisiana/,"I'm a Toll Collector at a Highway in Louisiana, There are STRANGE RULES to follow !","**Have you ever wondered if a job could kill you — not with danger, but with secrets so strange they gnaw at your sanity?**

Or let me ask you this: What would you do if a silent red watch on your wrist started ordering you to *stand* — or else? Would you obey, not knowing what waits if you don’t?

That’s the kind of nightmare I stumbled into when I took the most ordinary-sounding job on paper — *toll collector* on a lonely stretch of Highway 371, buried deep in the humid underbelly of Louisiana. It was a job as plain as day: sit in a booth, swipe cards, take cash, lift the gate, scribble license plates in a battered notepad. No health insurance. No sick leave. No overtime. Just a bare-bones paycheck hovering a whisper above minimum wage.

Yet, beneath that thin surface, something festered. Something no one warned me about.

Desperation drove me to it. My car had coughed its last breath. Rent was overdue, and my landlord’s patience was running on fumes. A cousin I barely kept in touch with handed me this lifeline: *“They’re hiring. No questions asked. No paperwork. Just show up. You can start tonight.”*

So I did. And when the man in charge passed me the cold, rusty keys, he muttered something that should have sent me running:

*“Don’t worry about the weird stuff. Just follow the alerts.”*

I laughed it off, assuming he meant storm warnings or AMBER alerts crackling through a dusty radio. But I couldn’t have been more wrong.

That first night swallowed me whole in its quiet. I arrived at the booth at 10:45 PM, the thick air sticky on my skin. The booth itself was a cramped, rotting box — no bigger than a closet. Inside: a metal chair with cracked vinyl, a desk scarred with cigarette burns, a stubborn cash drawer, a yellowed notepad clinging to its last pages, a wheezing fan that did little to fight the heat... and one item that made my gut twist the moment I saw it.

A watch.

Not the kind you’d buy at Walmart or find in your granddad’s drawer. This was strange — a black band tight around my wrist, its screen pulsing a dim red glow. No clock face. No numbers. No buttons. No apps. Just that blood-colored screen waiting, as if it was alive. I told myself it must be some outdated tracker — for my hours, maybe my heartbeat.

Hours oozed by like molasses. A trickle of cars rolled through. I collected tolls, logged plates, battled mosquitoes the size of quarters. My eyelids grew heavy.

Then — at exactly 1:13 AM — the watch came to life.

One word.

**“STAND.”**

My throat constricted as I forced myself to clear it. I blinked at the watch, puzzled, heart thumping like a drum. Before I could think, a voice — not from the booth, not from my phone — echoed deep in my skull. Like a broadcast beamed straight into my mind.

*“Emergency notice. Rule Four. Between 1:10 and 1:20 AM — do not remain seated.”*

Every hair on my arms stood at attention. Without hesitation, I shoved the chair back, its legs shrieking across the floor, and stood. That’s when I saw it.

Outside the booth’s grimy window, a shape crept past. A black, slithering mass that clung to the ground like a shadow came alive. No feet. No face. No sound. Just endless black stretching across the asphalt.

I didn’t breathe. I didn’t move. The thing didn’t look at me — if it even had eyes. Time dragged its feet. And then, as suddenly as it had begun, the watch’s glow blinked out at 1:20. The thing was gone.

That was the first rule I learned. The first night that taught me — this job wasn’t about tolls. It was about surviving whatever shared that highway with me.

So tell me... if you were in that booth, would you follow the watch? Would you obey — even if you didn’t understand? Or would curiosity get the better of you?

Stick around. Because what came next? It wasn’t just rules. It was warnings. And breaking them had a price.

By the end of that first hellish week, I had seven rules scrawled in shaky handwriting across the stained pages of my notepad — a personal bible of survival, stitched together not by logic, but by fear.

None of these rules came from a training manual. No supervisor handed them to me with a wink and a “good luck.” No — they came to me in the dead of night, whispered by that voice that invaded my mind, delivered through that cursed red watch, like some cryptic survival guide written for a world that shouldn’t exist. And as I learned quickly — *violating these rules wasn’t just careless. It was suicidal.*

Here’s what I lived by:

**Rule 1:** If the same car passes through twice within ten minutes — no matter the driver, no matter how innocent they look — you charge double. 

**Rule 2:** If a child is behind the wheel, you wave them through. Don’t take their money. Don’t ask questions. 

**Rule 3:** If you hear knocking beneath the floorboards, play the booth’s radio — immediately. 

**Rule 4:** Between 1:10 and 1:20 AM, do *not* stay seated. Stand up and don’t sit until it’s over. 

**Rule 5:** Never look at anyone who speaks backward. Keep your eyes down. 

**Rule 6:** If an old woman pays with exact change, look into her eyes. Make sure they’re human. 

**Rule 7:** If the watch flashes the word “HIDE,” crawl under the desk and do not, under any circumstances, breathe loud enough to be heard.

At first glance, some of these rules seemed almost laughable. A child driving? Charge double for the same car? But trust me — they weren’t jokes. I didn’t invent them. I didn’t dream them up during a long, lonely shift. These were commands, delivered in that hollow voice that echoed through my skull like the tolling of a funeral bell. And behind every rule, there was a consequence waiting — sharp-toothed and unforgiving — for those foolish enough to ignore it.

And I, like a fool, learned that lesson the hard way.

It was on my twelfth shift — a night that began like all the others, thick with the scent of swamp rot and the unshakable feeling of being watched. The air hung heavy, and the booth felt smaller somehow, like the walls were inching closer, trying to squeeze the life out of me.

Around 3:00 AM, when the world felt more dead than asleep, I heard it. At first, it was a faint tap-tap-tap beneath the floorboards. Like someone drumming their fingers, impatient, waiting for me to slip up. I froze, my ears straining in the dark.

The tapping grew bolder. Louder. A steady knocking that seemed to pulse in rhythm with my heartbeat. *Rule 3.* I knew what it demanded. Turn on the radio. Drown out the sound. But I hesitated.

The watch stayed dark — no word, no alert. And in my arrogance, or perhaps exhaustion, I convinced myself the rule wasn’t active tonight. Maybe it was just the building settling, or rats beneath the floor. I reasoned it away, because the truth was too frightening to face.

That’s when the knocking stopped. For the briefest breath of a second, all was silent.

And then — **CRACK.**

The floor split. The wood splintered like kindling. From that jagged opening, a hand emerged. A hand that wasn’t right. Its skin was a sickly gray, stretched tight over bones that jutted at the wrong angles. Fingers — six of them — too long, too thin, tipped with nails like slivers of glass. It moved with eerie grace, wrapping around the leg of my chair as if it had all the time in the world.

My blood turned to ice. My throat tightened so violently I thought I’d choke. I opened my mouth, but no sound came — not at first. Then, instinct took over. My shaking fingers smacked the radio dial, and the booth erupted in a wave of static and white noise.

The hand twitched. Its fingers flexed, as if testing the air. And then — like smoke caught in a breeze — it slipped back beneath the floorboards, vanishing into the dark crack that slowly sealed itself shut.

I didn’t sleep the next day. I couldn’t. Because now I knew: these weren’t empty rules. They were shields. And breaking them had woken something that still wasn’t done with me.

Even now — on some nights — that knocking comes back. Faint at first, like a memory I can’t bury. A reminder that it’s waiting. And believe me, every single time, I *play the radio*.

So what would *you* do if you sat in that booth, with nothing but a flickering radio and a set of rules that felt more like warnings than guidance? Would you follow them, or would curiosity — or pride — cost you everything?

Stay tuned. Because what I’ve shared? That was only the beginning. And the worst — the rule I couldn’t bring myself to obey — nearly cost me my life.

It was a night like all the others — or so I told myself. But deep down, I sensed it. That heavy, suffocating stillness that wraps around you right before something breaks. And when it broke... It changed everything.

I had grown used to the rhythm of terror. The familiar pulse of that watch lighting up with commands. The quiet dread of waiting for what came next. But this night? This night rewrote the rules — quite literally.

Sometime past 2:00 AM, when the fog rolled in thick as graveyard mist and the highway lay deserted, I felt it. The sudden, *unnatural* drop in temperature. The way the air seemed to thicken, as if the darkness itself had weight.

That’s when I noticed the car.

No headlights. No engine hum. I never heard it arrive — it was simply *there*, idling at the gate like it had materialized from thin air. Its paint was the color of rusted iron, the body warped in places, as if it had seen things no car should survive.

Then — the watch blinked red, its glow casting eerie shadows on the booth walls.

**“EYES.”**

A single word. But before my heart could even quicken, that voice — the one that felt like it scraped across my bones — filled my head.

*“Emergency Notice. Rule Six. If an old woman pays with exact change... check her eyes.”*

And there she was.

Without sound, without warning, she stood at my window. Her skin looked like crumpled parchment — so thin it seemed the wind might tear it. Her hand, trembling but purposeful, reached out with a wrinkled dollar bill and a small, shaking handful of coins.

*“A dollar twenty-five,”* she whispered, her voice like dead leaves brushing across pavement. And then she smiled — a slow, hollow curve of the lips that didn’t touch her hollow expression.

I forced myself to look up. My throat tightened so violently I thought I might gag.

Where her eyes should have been... *nothing.* Not blindness. Not damaged or scarred. Just two dark pits — empty as an open grave, as if something had scooped her soul out through those voids.

Panic clawed at me. My instincts shrieked at me to look away, to close the window, to flee. My fingers fumbled for the button, eager to lift the gate, to be rid of her, to end this nightmare.

*“Keep the change,”* I stammered, voice cracking, as I reached for the switch.

But she didn’t move.

She didn’t drive through.

Instead, she remained there, frozen, smile still carved into that lifeless face. And then she spoke again — her voice sharper this time, the sound burrowing under my skin like ice water pouring down my spine.

*“You’re not checking close enough.”*

My skin crawled. My heart pounded so loud I was sure she could hear it. I spun and slapped the radio on, hoping the static would break whatever spell this was. But the radio gave me nothing — only silence, as if the booth itself held its breath.

And when I turned back — she was gone.

The car. The woman. The coins she had held. Every trace of them — vanished like smoke. The only evidence she had ever been there was the cold dread that clung to me like a second skin.

Then, as if the booth had decided to twist the knife, I heard it.

The *flip* of paper.

I turned slowly, every nerve on edge. My notepad — my tattered, lifeline of rules — lay open on the desk. The page glistened, as if ink had just been spilled across it, fresh and black, bleeding into the paper like it had a mind of its own.

And there it was.

A new rule. One I had never written. One that hadn’t come from the voice — at least, not yet.

**Rule Eight:** *Never let her speak twice.*

**I was trembling.**

Not from the cold—**from knowing**. From the sick certainty that she wasn’t finished.

*What would I do if she came back?*

Because deep down, I knew this much:

**She will.**

Not tonight. Maybe not tomorrow. But one night, she’ll return.

And next time?

She won’t knock. She won’t smile. And she sure as hell won’t wait.

So if you thought *that* was strange…

**You haven’t heard the worst of it.**

Because the deeper the night went, **the darker the rules got.**

And trust me—

**They only got harder to follow.**

It started like any other night — but by now, I knew better than to trust the quiet. The quiet was a liar. It wrapped itself around the booth like a shroud, hiding what waited beneath. And that night, it hid something I still can’t explain.

It was well past 2:00 AM when the red glow of the watch broke through the darkness, casting its sinister light across my hand.

**“DOUBLE.”**

The word pulsed, as if alive. And I knew exactly what it meant.

**Rule One.** Same car twice within ten minutes? You charge double. Simple, right? But nothing out here was ever simple.

At 2:04, I’d seen it — a silver SUV, its body dusty, a small dent carved into the rear bumper like a scar, and a cheap pine tree air freshener swinging from the mirror. I barely gave it a thought as it rolled through.

But at 2:09 — there it was again.

Same vehicle. Same dent. Same swaying air freshener. I felt my stomach twist as I stepped to the window.

*“That’s gonna be two-fifty,”* I said, my voice steadier than I felt. *“You came through already.”*

The driver — a man maybe in his thirties, pale as moonlight, sweat dripping from his hairline — didn’t argue. His hands trembled as he fumbled for his wallet. He handed me the cash like someone surrendering, like he knew the rules too, somehow.

But just as I reached for the gate button, thinking this would be the end of it, he leaned forward. His eyes locked on mine, wide and glassy, the eyes of a man who’d seen something that broke him.

*“I never turned around,”* he said, his voice barely above a whisper. *“I just kept driving straight. Never saw a turnoff. Never hit a loop. But I’m back here.”*

I froze. My mouth went dry. My mind raced for something — *anything* — to say. But the words died in my throat.

He swallowed hard, desperation bleeding into his voice.

*“Do I keep going? Or will I come back again?”*

And then — the watch blinked.

**“DON’T.”**

Just like that. One word. A command. The gate stayed shut beneath my fingers. I didn’t argue. I didn’t dare.

The man’s face crumpled — fear, confusion, hopelessness. He opened his mouth, maybe to plead, maybe to curse, but before any sound came out, headlights bloomed in the rearview mirror.

Another vehicle.

Another silver SUV.

Identical in every detail. The dent. The dirt. The dangling air freshener swaying in the still night air.

But this one…

This one had no driver.

The empty SUV rolled forward, silent, steady, as if guided by unseen hands. Or maybe something worse. The man in front of me saw it too. His eyes darted to the mirror, his breath quick and shallow.

*“What the hell is happening?”* he choked out, voice cracking.

I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. The truth was, I didn’t know.

The two vehicles sat there — one with a terrified man trapped behind the wheel, the other hollow and soulless, like a reflection that had stepped out of the glass to take his place.

And I could do nothing but watch.

By the third week, I stopped trying to make sense of any of it. I gave up looking for patterns, for logic, for any thread that might tie this nightmare together. The highway didn’t play by human rules. And I’d learned, the hard way, that trying to outthink it only made it hungrier.

So I obeyed. Every alert, every rule, no matter how strange, no matter how terrifying — I followed them like gospel. But even blind obedience wasn’t always enough.

One night — the air thicker than usual, heavy with a storm that never came — the watch went mad.

The red glow didn’t just blink. It *flashed*, frantic and blinding, casting the booth in hellish light.

**DANGER. DANGER. DANGER.**

Over and over, pulsing faster than my heartbeat. No rule. No instruction. Just that single word hammering into my brain.

And then — the broadcast.

*“Emergency Override. Hide now. Don’t ask questions.”*

That voice — cold, mechanical, empty — didn’t leave room for hesitation. My body moved before my mind could catch up. I dropped to the floor and crawled under the desk, the splinters biting into my palms. I didn’t kill the lights. I didn’t even look at the gate. There wasn’t time.

And then I heard it.

A scraping sound — low, deep, like metal being dragged across asphalt. But not in jerks or bursts. This was smooth. Relentless. Something enormous was moving past the booth, slow and steady, like it knew exactly where I was.

Bigger than a semi. Bigger than anything I’d ever seen on that stretch of road. And yet... it cast no shadow. It made no noise except that endless, skin-crawling scrape.

And then — it spoke.

A voice like rust. Like wind through a graveyard. Like metal tearing itself apart.

*“Rulebreaker... where...”*

The word stretched, cracked, echoed through the night. My throat clenched so tight it hurt. My lungs screamed for air, but I didn’t dare breathe.

It dragged itself along, slow, sniffing — or maybe listening. Searching.

*“Took the coin... kept the stare... no radio...”*

The words slithered under the booth’s door like smoke, wrapping around me, choking me. It was naming the rules — the ones that had been broken, by me or by someone before.

And then — the booth lights flickered. Once. Twice. Then died.

The watch’s glow blinked out.

Dead silence. Dead dark.

I knew, in that instant, it was right outside. Close enough to touch. Close enough to end me if I made a sound.

So I didn’t breathe. Not a gasp. Not a whimper. I lay there, every muscle locked, while time twisted itself into something unrecognizable. Seconds felt like minutes. Minutes felt like hours. The thing waited. And so did I.

And then — as if satisfied, or maybe bored — it moved on. The scraping faded, swallowed by the night.

The lights snapped back. The booth hummed with power again. And the road? Empty. Like nothing had ever been there.

But the notepad told a different story.

Its pages rustled on their own, as if the wind turned them — but the booth was sealed tight. And there, scrawled in jagged, angry writing that looked burned into the paper:

**Rule 9: You only get one warning.**

**I don’t know who writes the rules. I don’t know** ***what*** **writes them. I don’t know why this stretch of highway is cursed — why this patch of blacktop demands so much from anyone foolish enough to man this booth. And somewhere along the way... I stopped asking.**

Because some questions only invite answers you can’t survive.

There are nights when the cars that roll through carry faces I know. Faces I loved. Faces I buried. A cousin who died five years ago — smiling behind the wheel like we’re meeting for coffee. My mother — long gone, waving like nothing’s wrong. Old friends. Former neighbors. All dead. All acting like they’re just out for a midnight drive.

And I? I say nothing. I stare at the tolls, at the coins, at anything but *them*. Because speaking — acknowledging — might open a door I can’t close.

And then there are nights when the watch stays dark. No alerts. No rules. No guidance. And those nights? Those are the worst of all. Because silence on this road doesn’t mean safety. Silence means it’s watching. Waiting. Measuring my resolve. Testing whether I’ll crack.

I tell myself I can’t do this forever. That one day, I’ll walk out of the booth, leave the keys on the desk, and drive until I’m free. And I almost did.

Once.

It was just before dawn. I’d had enough. My bag was packed. My hand was on the door. I told myself: *This is it. I’m done. Let someone else play this game.*

That’s when the watch turned red.

**STAY.**

The word bled through the dark like an open wound. And then, the voice followed — that voice that sounds like wind howling through a graveyard:

*“Final Rule. If you leave... it follows.”*

And that was it. No explanation. No second chance. Just a final, quiet threat that wrapped icy fingers around my spine.

I don’t know what *it* is. I don’t want to know.

So I’m still here. Watching. Listening. Obeying. Writing new rules each time that cursed watch lights up, adding them to this frayed, stained notebook that has become my last line of defense.

And if you’re hearing this — if you ever find this notebook left behind in an empty booth, pages filled with these rules that don’t make sense but feel heavy with purpose — for God’s sake, don’t ignore it.

Because the booth may stand empty. The chair may sit cold. But the rules? The rules *still* stand.

And the watch?

The watch will find someone new.

So i went to grab a Big Mac because it was the fastest option, plus a cappuccino from Maccas. The Big Mac is now the size of a snack, gone in three bites. I looked at the total and realized I spent $32  between el jannah and maccas on food that wouldn’t even fill up a grown adult.

And I’m not even talking about fancy restaurants. These are considered budget friendly el Jannah markets itself like fast food, so it should be affordable. I honestly don’t get it. That same sandwich used to actually fill me up two years ago.

I'm going to take the precaution of using Dr. Collin's Biomin C toothpaste (better than sensodyne/nanohydroxyapatite) 1-2 weeks before using the white strips as well as after each use, so I'm not concerned about sensitivity.

A 1-2 tooth shade is absolutely essential for the career change I'll be making. I'm also going to cut out all coffee, processed sugar, and alcohol. I just have a few questions:

1. Is it possible to use crest white strips intermittently over many years to achieve a tooth shade of 1-2? Approximately, how long would this take?
2. Which would be the best version of crest white strips to do the above with the lowest risk of damaging my enamel? Or is that not possible without using a stronger version that would damage my enamel? I'm looking at the one with LEDs currently, but not sure if it's really worth it.

\[SCRIPT Part 1\](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VL44Ai7q8O\_KGkpty1nQ8bvb1z7XzMIUmiZj3ltAFk4/edit?tab=t.0)



*Context: At your office job in a big company, there’s a guy everyone has their eyes on. He’s charming, confident, smart, a leader, a gentleman, always willing to help others. Not to mention he’s very handsome. It’s no wonder he’s become incredibly popular shortly after he got hired, especially in the romance department. You, on the other hand, are more reserved and quiet. More introverted. Unfortunately, that gained you a bad reputation. Others would spread rumors that you were stuck up. That you thought you were better than everyone else. But what’s the point of fighting childish rumors? It doesn’t intervene in your work, which you do very well in, and the most anyone does is avoid you. You just live your peaceful, solitary office life. However, that peace had begun to be interrupted. You can’t help but feel like you are being watched. Yeah, the higher-ups like to breathe down everyone’s necks. That could be it… but this feels different. When an office party is announced, you don’t think about going at first, but an acquaintance from Public Relations who stops by every once in a while encourages you to go to relax for a bit. You relent when free food is brought up. You get there late, so everyone is already somewhat drunk. You stay around for a bit to eat and talk to your acquaintance. When it starts to get a little too rowdy, you take your leave. But when you get to the parking garage, you see a familiar face approach you.*



\[SCRIPT STARTS HERE\]



\[SFX of Listener’s footstep as they walk through the parking garage, followed by an extra pair of footsteps that get closer to the Listener\]



\[Drunk/Slightly aggressive\] Hey! You!



Yeah, you! Who else, loser?



\[Speaker gets closer. Listener: Can I help you?\]



Yeah, you \*can\* help me, actually. I want you to do my part of the report for this month. About the profits and budget and all that.



\[Listener: And why would I do that?\]



Um, because if you don’t, I can make your life worse than it already is. Everybody loves me, so they’ll believe anything bad I say about you. You already don’t have that great of a reputation, stuck-up bitch.



\[SFX of Listener walking away and tapping from her phone. Speaker grabs the phone.\]



Hey, it’s rude to use your phone while someone is talking to you. 



\[Listener: Look, I don’t care what you tell other people about me. I’m not doing your report.\]



Yes, I know, \[mocking\] Ms. I-Don’t-Give-A-Fuck-What-People-Think-About-Me. 



But you only say that now cause people just leave you alone. And I can say stuff that’s damning enough for people to, hmm I don't know… accidentally spill coffee on your computer, put thumbtacks on your chair, trip you when you’re carrying a bunch of papers. And that would be the warm-up of your days… You know, you could at least try to take this seriously. That look is pissing me off. You really are one of those nonchalant assholes, huh?



\[Listener: Okay, I’ll do your work.\]



\[Surprised\] Wait, you’ll do it? Heh, that was easy.



\[Listener: My phone.\]



Your phone? Oh yeah. Here. By the way, if you have any questions about the report, don't bother-



\[Speaker's voice is heard from Listener's phone. The recording says, “And I can say stuff that’s damning enough for people to, hmm I don't know… accidentally spill coffee on your computer, put thumbtacks-”\]



\[Angry\] Give me that phone-



\[When Speaker tried to get close and grab Listener's phone, she kicked him between the legs\]



Omf!



\[Speaker drops to his knees\]



\[High-pitched\] What \*wince\* is wrong… with you!? 



\[SFX of Listener walking away, then of a car starting and driving away\]



… it's always the quiet ones.



{TIMESKIP - Morning the next day}



\[SFX of office noises, like people walking around, phones ringing, computer typing, people talking amongst each other. Then a particular pair of footsteps approach Listener\]



\[Smiling; acting polite\] So, what do you want?



\[Listener: Do my report for the month.\]



Do your report!? About the balances and cash flow? Was kicking my balls not enough? I thought you were just gonna ask me to leave you alone.



\[Listener: If you don't want to, that's fine. I'll just head over to HR and-\]



No! Wait! Ahem. Please… don't go to HR. I'll do it.



\[Listener: You really are such a nice guy.\]



\[Through teeth\] Yep, I'm such a nice guy. So happy to help.



\[Speaker walks away\]



\[Mumbling\] Stuck-up bitch… I need to get dirt on her.



{TIMESKIP - Evening outside Listener's home}



\[SFX of Speaker walking on dirt/grass\]



If she's weird in any way, I'm sure to find out while she's home. She was too damn normal throughout the day. Getting groceries. Doing laundry. And all while looking so… content? Like she had no care in the world. I don't know! It pissed me off!



\[SFX of Speaker walking up stairs then stopping\]



Okay, let's see if she's secretly some kind of freak… She seems to be living alone. 



\[Mocking\] Figures, since she likes being a ‘lone wolf’… She has pets? Obviously, I bet she doesn’t have any human friends that want to hang out with her… and she talks to them like people.



That’s pathetic, but not enough. Give me something! … okay, she put something on the TV. Maybe she watches some really fucked up shit… *KPop Demon Hunters?*… 



\[Disappointed\] It’s a cartoon. Really? That’s still pathetic, but I can’t do anything with this information. In fact, I think this movie is popular among adults, so this might actually make her look good. Ugh! … The music goes kinda hard though…



{TIMESKIP - A week later}



\[SFX of office noises, particularly typing as Speaker works on reports\]



\[Mumbling\] Okay, so, I’m probably not gonna get dirt on her. It’s been a week and the most interesting thing she’s done is accidentally burn her dinner once.



In fact, she's… actually not a complete loser. She has surprisingly good taste in movies and music. And some might even find her cutesy way of talking to her pets endearing. But she's still some stuck-up loner that's black mailing me. I need to set her up to look bad in some way, get it on camera, then-



\[Listener: How’s the report going?\]



\[Startled\] Oh my God! \[forced\] Hey! Hi. How are you doing? The report is coming along nicely. You have nothing to worry about.



PR coworker: Oh my God. You're doing her report?



Uh, I-



\[Listener: Yeah, {SPEAKER} offered to help me.\]



PR coworker: Wow. You really are a saint if you convinced her that she could use the help. I’ve been telling her she works too hard.



Y-Yeah, of course. It is not a big deal… our reports are related so I thought, “Why not?”. Hehe.



PR coworker: Well, I'm very happy to hear that, especially since I wanted to take her with me for a couple of weeks for a job.



\[Slight panic\] What!?



\[Quickly composed\] I mean, that sounds awesome, but I'm just worried that she might not allowed to leave just like that. I wouldn't want her to get in trouble.



PR coworker: I already spoke to her boss. He was hesitant, to say the least, \*but\* since you’re already helping her, I’m sure she’ll be allowed go now. \[To Listener\] You are coming with me to a big fashion show in New York. I'm gonna need that economist brain of yours when I talk to potential clients.



\[Struggling to keep up fake politeness\] Wow! That's… so awesome! New York fashion show. You must be sooo excited to be gone for \*two weeks\*!



PR coworker: Well, I gotta go. See you all later! And you; remember to have your stuff packed by Friday. Bye-bye!



\[Listener walks away too. Speaker drops his head on his desk.\]



\[Defeated\] … 2 weeks of tedious math… maybe I can flirt with some of the secretaries. I think Patricia does finance stuff.



{TIMESKIP - Two weeks later; morning}



\[SFX of office noises\]



\[Groaning, head down\] I have less than a week, and I’m only half way through the report… of course when \*I\* need help, everyone is ‘suddenly too busy’. So much for being a charitable gentleman… 



\[Listener: What was that?\]



\[Surprised\] Oh my God!



\[Fake politeness\] Hi! I am \*so\* glad to see you. How was your trip to New York?



\[Listener: Great. And how's the report?\]



That’s good! And the report is going great!



\[Whisper; cocky\] You probably thought I’d have trouble since it’s double my usual work, but jokes on you, ‘cause I actually have friends and they’ve been helping me.

\[Listener: Good to hear, since the report is due the day after tomorrow.\]



What? The day after tomorrow…



\[Panicked\] Oh shit! I got the date mix- I mean… I’ll be fine. I’ll just let my friends know I need a little more help.



\[SFX of Listener walking away\]



… I’m so fucking screwed. Maybe I can ask the boss for an extension?



{TIMESKIP - Evening}



\[SFX of Listener walking through the parking lot, followed by a second pair of footsteps\]



\[Stern\] Where’s the damn phone?



\[Listener: Why?\]



Because I’m not losing my positions because you thought it would be funny to dump your workload on me.



\[Listener: I thought you had your friends help you.\]



Well, I lied. Now give me your phone!



\[Listener: No.\]



\[SFX of Listener walking away\]



Okay, I wanted to do this the easy way, but we're gonna have to do this the hard way.



\[SFX of Speaker grabbing Listener from behind, holding her in place and she struggles while Speaker reaches for her bag\]



\[Struggling noises\] Stop moving! Give me your bag!



\[Speaker is able to grab it, and immediately get the Listener’s phone\]



Ha! Now… Recording… and delete! Now you have to help me with the report, or I’ll do more than just spread nasty rumors about you.

\[Listener: I saved the recording somewhere else.\]



\[Defeated\] …what?



… of course you saved it somewhere else. You’re not stupid. So not only am I gonna get demoted, but my reputation will be ruined for good.



\[Speaker sniffling\]



\[Listener: Are you crying?\]



So what if I am crying!? My life is going to be ruined, and I’m gonna be a loser like you now! No one is going to want to be associated with me! I might as well just quit and start somewhere new.



\[Listener: I feel like you’re being dramatic.\]



I’m not being dramatic! You don’t get it! I \*need\* people to like me. Even if it’s dumb secretary girls who do nothing but gossip all day, or ass-kissers from marketing, I can’t risk \*one\* rumor going out and reliving highschool all over again!



\[Speaker drops to his knees, sobbing\]



\[Shaky\] I just… I just d-don’t want to be alone a-again.



\[Speaker keeps crying as Listener slowly walks over to him, sitting next to him\]



How does it not bother you? People saying you’re a stuck up bitch that thinks she’s better than everyone. You have no friends in the office, but when I see you working, you’re okay. Almost at peace, even. 



\[Listener: I have a friend.\]



The one who took you to New York? Doesn’t count. (He/She/They) aren’t even in the country half the time.



Either way, just… I don’t get it… it thinks that’s why I targeted you in the first place. I hated how okay you seemed. You didn’t feel the need to use a mask, despite that leading you to solitude. And you owned that solitude… I envied you. So I needed to find a way to make you miserable, like I am.



I have to put on this stupid ‘good guy’ act every \*fucking\* day. Be nice and helpful. Pretend I ‘see the good’ in everyone. I don’t even like most of the people in the office… honestly, I don’t like anyone. They all suck. But I still do it to be on their good side… which honestly doesn’t mean shit anymore!



\[Listener: You say that because they didn’t help you with the report?\]



Yeah. Even when I offered to pay for lunch or drinks after work, they didn’t want to help me. After everything else I’d done for them. I mean, I know I’m not supposed to expect anything back if I’m being ‘nice’, but maybe it should’ve crossed their minds. “Hey, {SPEAKER’S NAME} did all these favors for me. I should maybe lend a hand this time around.” God, I probably seem like such a pushover! 



\[Muffled groans\]



\[Listener: Dumbass.\]



Yes. I know I’m a dumbass. Doing more work is rewarded with… even more work. Why did I ever think otherwise?



\[Sigh\]



\[Listener: How much work do you have left?\]



I still need, like… half of the report. Why?



\[Listener: I’ll help you.\]



\[Surprised\] Wait, for real?



… In exchange for what?



\[Listener: Just don’t be an asshole to me anymore.\]



That’s it? Just not be an asshole to you? … what about the voice recording?



\[Listener: I lied.\]



Wait! So I deleted the only recording! You asshole! You scared the shit out of me!



\[Chuckling\]

So you really aren’t that smart, huh?



\[Listener: Do you want help or not?\]



\[Rushed\] No! I’m sorry. Please help me.



\[Listener giggles\]



\[Mumbling\] Your laugh is cute.



\[Listener: What was that?\]



\[Rushed\] Nothing! Just… I’ll send you the parts I need help on.



\[Speaker gets up and starts walking away; he pauses for a moment\]



Thanks, by the way. Talk to you later.

I’ve been using a Timemore C3S and it’s been great, but I’m looking for more clarity and that tea-like profile in my brews. I’m torn between the Linglons 64mm and ZP6 Special and could use some input.

Main things I care about:
	•	Clarity/tea-like flavor – which one shines more here?
	•	Build & packaging – do they come with a case? Solid feel?
	•	Ease of dialing in – I’m not super used to large burr-style grinders. Are they beginner-friendly in terms of grind adjustment?

Also, do they only work well with really high-end beans, or will they still make mid-tier coffee taste great?

Maybe even before the police get to my house. I want someone, anyone, to know why I’m doing this. Maybe with some perspective, I’ll seem like less of a monster. I’m not a monster, I’m a mother. 

Divorce is a hell of a thing. 

After every scrap of evidence my lawyer and I gathered, every late night and early morning, every written testimony from everyone I knew— the stupid judge hadn’t even read them, hadn’t even looked at the photos of bruises. 

Travis had taken the classes and gone to AA, and that was good enough for “your honor”. 

Even though it was 50/50 custody, even though I had half, I felt like I lost it all. 

I’d left him for Trinity, my 8-year-old. I did all of this to keep her safe, and now she was going to have to face him alone. 

I failed her. 

Explaining it to her was tough.

“But I don’t want to, Mommy!”

I sighed, petting her head gently. “I know,” I whispered. “I don’t want you to, either.”

“It’s not fair! Why do I have to?” 

“Because the important man said you have to. The rules say whatever he says goes.”

“Why?” 

I blinked the tears from my eyes, “because your daddy did just the right things, and the important man said that made him a good daddy.”

“But he’s a bad daddy,” she wined. 

I sniffed, I didn’t like to talk badly about her father to her, but at the same time I never wanted to invalidate her. Because she was right. Travis was a bad daddy. “I know,” I wiped the tears from my eyes. 

It broke my heart that she’d have to go back there without me. I can’t imagine what that’ll be like for her. 

“I’m scared,” she whispered hollowly. 

“I know, baby, but I’ll be right here for you when you come back,” my voice cracked with the fear and pain I felt. 

Going to AA, and the abuse and parenting classes, Travis had met some new people. Awful people. People like himself. 

I guess that’s why it started getting worse. 

I guess that’s what started the changes. 

First, she started getting quieter. Sinking into herself. The bouncy girl that sang and danced all around the house at all times, slowly became the sullen silent girl that sat in corners and spoke softly only when she needed to. 

I don’t even remember when the sing-song, “mommy pass the ketchup, I need some for my smiley fries. If I don’t get some, they’ll be frowny fries!”— turned into the mumbled, “mom, can I please get the ketchup?”

It happened over the course of the year, gradually quieter and quieter. 

She cut her long, beautiful hair. 

She stopped wearing her favorite dresses. She said she only wanted pants when I took her shopping. Even for my sister’s wedding, she would only wear a dress if she could put her little jeans underneath. 

These were just little things, but her personality was the first change I noticed. 

A few weeks in to the split custody, I heard a shrill scream in the dead of night. 

I bolted upright, thinking he had gotten to my baby. It took a few blinks before I realized he wasn’t here. I didn’t have to save her, I needed to comfort her. 

I was at her bedside before I knew it. She flinched as I touched her. She was babbling “I won’t tell,” and “I don’t like that,” and “it hurts.”

It made me look at the bruises on her arms. A hand that had clearly grabbed too hard, with too much authority. He’d been hurting her again. 

“It’s okay, honey, Mommy’s right here,” I told her frantically. 

She screamed again and tucked her arms close, kicking her feet. Hot tears streaked her cheeks. “Get off of me!” She sobbed. 

“Baby, it was a bad dream, it’s okay,” I soothed. 

Her eyes seemed to fix on me, and she flung her arms around my neck. “Mommy, mommy, it was horrible.”

“Shh, Trinity, it’s okay,” I didn’t know what else to say to her. 

She sniffled, curling herself closer. “They did something to me,” she whispered. 

“What’d they do?” 

“I’m not supposed to say,” she cried. “They… they put something inside of me.”

That was a lot to chew on. I mulled it over, knowing Travis had been into some pretty dark stuff. Who knows what he and his friends could’ve done to her, or have had done to her. Had they put a curse on her, or a demon in her? The idea that a malevolent spirit was feeding on my daughter both enraged and terrified me.  

I prayed with her. Asking God to undo whatever Travis and done, and protect her from him doing more. 

I petted her head, not knowing this was the beginning. 

Next came the appetite. She started eating and eating and eating some more. It was insatiable. I saw that girl wolf down a stack of pancakes as tall as her head and neck combined. 

I woke up in the middle of night to get a glass of water, and found her sitting on the floor in front of the fridge eating anything she could get her little hands on. 

She started eating weird things, too. Like putting a pickle under a slice of cheese in the microwave, then eating it with a fork. Meat sticks with tartar sauce. Cottage cheese with ruffles sour cream and cheddar chips (actually that one was really good). She craved maraschino cherries the most. She ate a whole jar in one sitting. 

It seemed like a growth spurt had hit her like a bus. 

Trinity started maturing in other ways, too.  Growing hair, filling out in certain places, body odor. 

I had thought she was a little young, but maybe she was just an early bloomer. 

Then one morning, I was getting her ready for school. Packing her lunch, making sure she showered and got ready, the whole bit. When she came into the kitchen fidgeting with her shirt, I was cooking bacon. I turned to tell her something when I realized she was turning green. I began to ask her what was wrong, when she doubled over slightly and spewed rancid beige and pink puke all over me. I swore I could see the rancid acidic, fruity, fishy smell. 

I gagged myself. 

“Oh my god, I’m so sorry,” she panicked. 

I grabbed a towel and wiped her chin where a little excess dribbled, “it’s okay. Are you sick?” 

She nodded, “my tummy hurts,” she clutched it to demonstrate. 

I sighed, “go lay down, I’ll call the school.” 

She nodded again, solemnly, embarrassed, before shuffling off to her room. 

Trinity kept throwing up, too. Every other morning she rushed to expel whatever racked her body. 

It was then that I started getting suspicious. 

I was frustrated I wasn’t getting any answers from Travis. Frustrated that I didn’t know how to help her. 

Her face began to change. Not just as she grows, but her nose swelled up and her eyes sunk in. She started getting acne. Red dots paraded across my little girls face and sores opened from her little fingers picking them. Her hair became greasier and started falling out. Her nails became brittle. She became brittle. 

Then, I started noticing her body shape. Her hips and thighs got bigger, her stomach distended, and her unmentionables swelled. Her feet and hands got so big they looked disproportionate to her body. 

Trinity was changing inside and out. 

She was irritable. Not regular maturing kid irritable, but something else. She had rage behind those eyes sometimes. 

Once, she frisbeed a plate at my head. She picked up things she shouldn’t have been able to. She toppled our statue of Mother Mary, breaking her open beckoning hands. 

I bought her a cross to wear around her neck, but she never wanted to wear it. 

I sprinkled holy water in her food and she threw it up. 

I put salt around the door and windows in her room and I found them dusted away. 

One day, she winced in pain as she bit into a cupcake. 

I squinted, trying to make sense of it. Had the cupcake hurt her? “Sweetie, come here.”

She looked worried, like she’d done something wrong. 

“C’mon,” I coaxed. 

She came over with her head hung low. 

I gently touched her chin and lifted her head. “Open up.”

When she did I was hit with the smell of decay. All of her teeth were laced with yellow, brown, and black. There were holes in some spots, and cracks in others. 

Whatever this was, she was rotting from the inside. 

It was then that I called our priest about an exorcism. Father Wilkerson said these things take time, he’d have to get approval. He told me to take her to the doctor first.  

So I took her to the dentist, and three extractions, seven crowns, and 18 fillings later, she was a new girl. 

It was some time before I heard back from the priest. I tried to ask him about it at church, but he always told me he was still waiting. 

I couldn’t wait anymore. I couldn’t sit by as my daughter was victim to some unholy spirit that tore her body and mind apart. She wasn’t my daughter anymore. She belonged to the demon now. 

I cried myself to sleep often. 

She woke me up with her nightmares often. 

She kept just saying they put something inside of her, and I knew that Travis had put a demon inside my daughter to punish us. 

This all lead up to this morning. 

She woke me up early with a nightmare, and while she dozed back off I drank my coffee. 

When she got up she immediately emptied what little contents she had in her stomach, loudly retching as she prayed to the porcelain god. 

We prayed and ate, and she managed to keep it down. 

Then she got ready to shower, and that’s when shit really hit the fan. 

I heard her scream. 

I ran to her, worried that some ungodly thing had gotten to her. 

It had. 

I burst through the door to find my daughter screaming and crying hot tears. She was naked, ready for her shower. Her hands clutched her sides as she fell back against the bathtub. “It hurts, it hurts,” she screamed. There was a mess of watery blood pooling on the floor. It ran down her legs. It was then that I saw the affliction. 

Her stomach stretched and bowed and moved. There was something moving inside my baby. A little hand pressed against the elastic skin, making a distinct print. 

My scream joined hers, and I rushed to her side. She grabbed my hand so hard I felt the sickening crack and pop of my weak finger bones. “Mommy, call the hospital, I’m going to die.” 

“No, no, honey,” I told her. “You’re not going to die. We’re going to get this demon out of you!”

She shook her head as she cried out a string of nonsense in pain. 

I reached for my phone and made two calls. I called the priest and told him to get his holy ass over here. I don’t care about approval we need this now. And I called my sister. She said she was on her way. 

I moved Trinity to the dining table, figuring that would be the best place to do it. 

She writhed and moaned and screamed out. 

Father Wilkerson came first. He really didn’t want to without approval. He kept telling me to take her to the hospital first. But when he saw the state she was in, he decided to do some tests. 

He kneeled beside her, praying with her. 

Her screaming became even louder and she thrashed and banged her head on the table. 

He sprinkled holy water and she flinched and howled. 

“Fuck you!” Screamed my eight year old baby girl through her teeth to our priest. 

He steeled himself, and rose to his feet, opening his bible. He was going to do it. He was going to free my baby. 

That’s when my sister walked in. 

The priest turned to see Jess approach, clutching her purse nervously. 

She took one look at Trinity and began to cry. She took her hand, holding it gently. 

Trinity seemed to calm down a little. 

“Antie,” she wheezed, her voice hoarse from all the screaming. 

“Hello, beautiful,” she whispered. “I’m gonna talk to your mommy, okay?” 

She nodded, beginning to tense up as another wave of agony hit her. She screamed and Father Wilkerson began praying again. 

Jess grabbed my arm harshly as she led me into the blood covered bathroom. “You need to take her to the hospital now!”

I shook my head, “no, no he put a demon in her, I know it!”

She grabbed my arms, “you take her to the hospital, or I will.” 

“There is no injection against the devil,” I wailed, “this is the only way I can get my baby back!”

She slapped me, “you’re a sorry excuse for a mother,” she spat. “Come with us or don’t,” she ripped a towel off the rack to cover Trinity’s body. And I followed her into the kitchen sheepishly. If she was going, I was going with her. 

I’d told her I would always be there for her, and if that means she’s stuck like this for a few more hours , than I’ll be right there with her until we can get back to the priest. 

The drive was uncomfortable. I sat in the back with Trinity’s writhing body resting in my lap. She wailed and howled as the unclean spirit wracked her body. 

They rushed her in right away, and she was seen in record time. 

And everything changed when that doctor spoke to us. 

I still hear his words echoing in my head. Even now as I clutch the pillow in my hands. 

She looks so beautiful, I mused. She lay sleeping in the hospital bed. Her hair a halo around her head like the angel she really was. 

I love her, and that’s why I’m doing this. Because she can’t live in a world where what the doctor said is true. 

Because he told me my daughter is pregnant. ",11,1752285577.0,nosleep,2,0.92,False
1lxorzn,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1lxorzn/the_scarecrows_watch_part_1/,The Scarecrow’s Watch (Part 1),"My name’s Ben, and I was fifteen the summer I stayed with my grandparents.

Mom said it would be “good for me.” A break from the city life. Somewhere quiet after Dad died in that car crash. I didn’t argue. What was there to argue about anymore?

Their house sat on a couple dozen acres in rural North Carolina, surrounded by woods and with a massive cornfield that buzzed with cicadas day and night. My grandfather, Grady, still worked the land, even though he was in his seventies. Grandma June mostly stayed in the house, baking, knitting, and watching old TV shows on a television twice my age.

They were kind, but strange. Grady never smiled, and Grandma’s eyes always seemed to be looking at something just over your shoulder. The cornfield was their pride and joy. Tall stalks, thick rows, perfectly maintained. And right in the middle stood the scarecrow. I saw it on the first day I arrived.

It was too tall (like seven feet) and its limbs were wrong. Thin and knotted like old tree branches you’d see in rain forest videos. It wore a faded flannel shirt and a burlap sack over its head, stitched in a crude smile. I don’t know what it was but something about it made my skin crawl. When I asked about it, Grandma just said, “It keeps the birds out. Don’t want them crows eating our corn Benny.”

Grady didn’t answer at all.

But at night, I’d hear things. Rustling from the field. Thuds. Low groans, like someone dragging a heavy sack over dry ground. I convinced myself it was wind. Or raccoons. Or just being away from home, messing with my head. I just wasn’t use to the quiet at night. I was hearing things I never would or could in the city.

Until the fifth  night.

I woke up thirsty and walked past the kitchen window to get a glass of water. That’s when I saw it. The scarecrow wasn’t where it should’ve been. Now it was closer to the house.

It had moved. I blinked. Rubbed my eyes. But there it stood, just at the edge of the field now. Still. Watching.

I told Grady the next morning. He just looked up from his coffee and said, “Don’t go into the corn. Not unless you want to take its place.”

I laughed nervously, thinking it was a joke. He didn’t laugh back.

That night, I couldn’t sleep. So I did what every dumb kid in your classic Hollywood horror story does. I grabbed a flashlight and went into the field.

The corn was thick, and hard to move through. Every rustle made me flinch. I turned in circles, trying to find the scarecrow.

The corn stocks rustled just off to my left. I froze in place. My heart thudded in my chest like a jackhammer. I peeked a few rows over and there it was. I couldn’t believe my eyes. It was… Walking.

Its feet dragged in the dirt, but it was moving, limbs twitching, head tilted unnaturally to one side. It stopped a few rows away from me, as if it knew I was there.

I didn’t scream. Hell, I couldn’t. I just turned and ran, crashing through stalks, until I saw the porch light. Grady stood outside, shotgun in hand.

“You went into the corn, didn’t you!?” he said, not angry. Just…

Behind me, I heard the rows rustle.

“You better get inside now,” he yelled. “It’s seen you!”

I\`m (24F) and in late january I meet this guy (lets call him Josh 26M) through a common friend (Lucy 26F) from university, Josh and my friend grew up together and her boyfriend was Josh\`s best friend so they all where in the same friend group. My studies is very time consuming and when I meet Josh I saw someone else (Adam), even so me and Josh exchanged numbers and meet up for coffee about 1 or 2 weeks later. I didnt feel the spark and found Josh quite reserved and not so interesting, in many ways I was relieved because it gave me the confidence that what I had with Adam was more real. However being with Adam while working on my start up and school became to overwhelming and we agreed that being with each other wasn\`t the right call, after it ended the feelings hit me waaaayyy harder than I expected. I took a step back from dating, my start up and school and really focused my energy on the things I wanted to do. I did tell Josh that I wasn\`t in a place where I should be dating and that it was nice meeting him, but not something we could continue at this time. After this, life went on and I didn\`t think to much about it, that\`s until our mutual friend (Lucy) told me how he had poured his chest out to her on one of their group dinners. Josh wasn\`t a guy that talked about feelings (one of the reasons I found him less interesting) and Lucy was absolutely shooked. Josh had told her he would do anything and that he knew I was the one he wanted.

At this point I had meet many of the people in the friendgroup and saw myself as ""part of the family"" with Lucy and her boyfriend (which ""conveniently"" is Josh\`s best friend). Fast forward a month and I meet Josh again, we were outside drinking and he invited us to a pregame at his place. Seeing him in ""his element"" surrounded by his friends triggered a curiosity in me, and I started to think maybe I signed off on Josh too quick, I knew from our date and through Lucy that he was a truly great guy so that was never the problem. I went home after the pregame but forgot my sunglasses at his place (and yes i forgot them, it wasnt with intent). We went to the same university so he delivered them to me at school the following day, the chat was nice and it was good to see him. Fast forward a week we meet again at a party, during this time the thought about reconciling had crossed my mind, but I was in no way thinking of actually taking action, mainly because Lucy had made it very clear to me that Josh was devestaded after I broke it off the last time and that if my intentions weren\`t pure and I didnt know what I wanted it was best to leave it. She even talked to Josh and told him ""he deserved better"" and that ""he deserved someone that wanted him back as much as he wanted"" (she was drunk and didn\`t know I could hear them)

After the conversation with Lucy, Josh approached me and wanted to have a talk, during the talk he asked if we could try again. I told him we should take it slow, but that we could give it a chance. Fast forward me and Josh have been dating for 3 months, summer is approaching and Josh is finishing up school and moving to another city (7 hours away) while im studying abroad the entire summer (2,5 months) with a 6 hour time difference. I told Josh that it takes time for me to develop feelings and that I didnt want to travel abroad with something ""unfinished"", so it was all or nothing and what I needed to be sure was time together. During this time he was writing his masters and working with school 24/7. I didn\`t like how the roles reversed (he used to have more free time while I worked with school and now it was the opposite) and especially because what I needed from him was time. It came to a place where I felt uncertain not only about my feelings but about his feelings for me, which was weird because I never felt uncertain about him wanting to be with me. He was a very stereotypical ""man"" that didnt like to talk about feelings and also found it hard to articulate himself, even so I never tought that my uncertainty would make him uncertain.

Eventually I found the relationship to be more draining than good. He had never been in a relationship before (neither have I) so I often felt I had to teach him and tell him what I wanted, he did take my feedback and implemented them but then I started feeling bad because I was afraid that I was telling/shaping him to be someone he wasnt. Eventually his actions and lack of effort (mostly because he spent all of his time in school, but still...) made me feel not appreciated and wanted. If I have to tell someone how to act towards me or what not to do that makes me feel disrespected, with that being said I knew it never came from a disrespectful place and I honestly think he was very scared stepping wrong and of losing me because he knew I would end it. To cut things short, I told him i think we should end it and that if he wanted to I would like to have a conversation, during the conversation I became visible upset and it was almost as if ""all my feelings"" came forward, all of a sudden ending things didnt feel like the right choice. It was very obvious that he felt uncomfortable by the entire situation but eventually he ended up staying at mine and we had the most beautiful time together. After he left the following morning we had no contact, I was very sad and the days before I left was spent trying to do as much fun things as possible to distract myself, and I could tell he was doing the same. The day I traveled he texted me telling me I deserved the best and to have a great time abroad. This was also the day he graduated from university so I replied congratulating him and wishing him the best.

BUT TO THE POINT!!! I taught that this feeling was something that was going to vanish... but it has now been over a month and I still want to talk to him and have contact with him. I\`m not interested in anyone else, I\`ve activated Hinge here but i dont see myself going on any dates, I dont want to answer anyone that asks me out and I still want to remain loyal to him. The thing is.... MY FUCKING PRIDE!!! I have NEVER, EVER, EVER  gone back to someone or even drunk called anyone and everytime I think about reaching out I think ""Mmm but if he cared like I care, he should have reached out"" and now im stuck in this loop. I have one year left of my studies and im moving to the same city as him when im done so I don\`t see doing long distance for a year a dealbreaker. Now I’m stuck in this weird limbo. We follow each other on Strava and lowkey stalk each other’s workouts, so we’re still “in orbit”... but we don’t talk. Please, help a girl out",0,1752285385.0,relationship_advice,1,0.5,False
1lxoq0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/Narcolepsy/comments/1lxoq0v/discussion_of_narcolepsy_and_other_sleep_related/,Discussion of narcolepsy and other sleep related topics,"I’ll start with my story and ask a bunch of questions that I am interested in hearing from others like me:) 

Type 1 narcoleptic here. I got diagnosed about 2 years ago now. I am 41 now and would like to highlight chronologically, some of my sleep experiences/symptoms. 

I still have vivid dreams that i remember from when I was a little girl. Starting around age 6ish. My first lucid dream was age 7. I was having a nightmare based off the book where the wild things are and I realized I was in a dream so I created a swirling portal in the sky of all my favorite cartoons: care bears and my little pony- yes, I am an 80’s child. That was the last nightmare I had til I was 19. Also the only time I had a lucid dream in childhood. Since the age of 13 have been a self diagnosed insomniac. The type of insomniac that often struggles to fall asleep -in older age has become much easier to fall asleep- but have also struggled to stay asleep. I would wake up anywhere between 3-12 times a night. Constantly tossing and turning and never felt rested. I’ve always been fascinated with anything esoteric and spiritual in nature. When I was 14/15 (9th grade) I read about heightening dream recall. This of course, fascinated me. So I began to practice it; each night setting the intentions to recall my dreams. Within a fortnight I was able to recall most dreams, often multiple dreams per night. Some faded quickly after waking, others still as fresh and vivid in my mind the day I had them. After graduating high school, I began to frequent a 24/hr diner. I would stay up often between 1-6am writing in my journal, having deep talks with strangers and friends alike, reading tarot cards for people, doodling and such. And boy did I drink a crap ton of coffee. Usually at least a full pot, sometimes two, and come home, sleep for a few hours and then head to work. I had attributed a lot of my sleep issues in my 20’s and 30’s to such terrible management of my time -though I don’t regret the fun times at the diner one bit-. When I was 21/22 years old, a dear friend had gifted me a book on how to induce OBE’s. She gave me that book because I told her about how I involuntarily astral projected to the great pyramids of Giza. I started to read the book and began practicing inducing an OBE. The first few attempts scared the crap out of me. I decided I needed to finish the book before I tried again. Within the week I finished the book and began my journey. Within two weeks I had my first incredible experience. I can go into more detail if people are interested, but I will leave it to a short, I came out of my body and traveled to a different dimension and then floated back in my body. This was an exhilarating experience, however, my body enjoyed it so much, that many nights my body would try to leave when I wasn’t ready. At the time I was going to college and to have not planned or prepared for an OBE, was inconvenient and quite honestly, scary how much my soul kept leaving. So I began to practice stopping such experiences until I could speak with a shaman or some other spiritual advisor. Life of course took me down a different path before I could gain the courage to try again. 
When I was 25 and pregnant with my first child is when my love of naps became a habit. After her birth, I would take naps when she did. I foolishly thought I was just  tired, loved to nap, and making up for my insomnia nights. Around this time, my dream recall diminished due to focusing on raising my kid. Then at 30, I had my second daughter. More sleepy naps with a baby, and later a diagnosis of inattentive ADD. I do hate medicine, so although prescribed adderal, I only took it when I really needed it, not daily like you’re supposed to. My naps became my haven. My two to three hours of heaven. The only time I ever truly felt rested and got what I would consider real sleep. For years this is how i survived. 

In 2020, is when i experienced my first cataplexy episode. I was at a bar with some friends and someone made me laugh. It felt like my knee was giving out, a quick moment of almost falling. But because I had multiple knee injuries and have experienced my knee giving out before.. I foolishly attributed that to my knee and not cataplexy. I didn’t even know what that was til 2 years ago.. lol. Anyways, from 2020-2023… I had only three our four times experienced cataplexy. Each one with laughter while standing, and the knee giving out feeling but no falls. It wasn’t until 2023, that I had a coworker prank another, that caused me to have a major cataplexy moment. This time though, I was sitting at my desk and my upper body gave out with each laugh and inbetween each laugh I gained my muscle tone. The prolonged laughter and intermittent loss of upper body muscle tone was alarming. Later that day, I was telling the coworker who he pranked what happened. It was so funny that retelling the story while standing had that knee giving out moments and if it were not for her desk to lean on, I would have fallen in the fits of laughter. That is when I told her about both episodes and she said that that was not normal and I needed to see a doctor. I first went to my primary care which referred me to a neurologist within five minutes of speaking to neurologist, he declared me being a narcoleptic. I was in denial and fear of potential consequences from the diagnosis and insisted upon further diagnostics to confirm it. I took two sleep studies and so six months later I was officially declared a type one narcolepsy diagnosis. Because I was already on Adderall. They did not prescribe any additional medication. However, in 2024 I had a new symptom develop. I was dreaming and in my dream I went to punch this girl, but in real life, I broke out of paralysis and ended up punching my 10-year-old daughter in the face. This obviously frightened both me and my daughter.  I immediately made a doctor’s appointment the next day to be seen Which is when the doctor prescribed Xyrem. I’ve been on the medicine since September 2024 and for the most part, it is truly changed my life for the better. However, when I did increase my dosage from 3.75 to 4.0 it was too much for my body and I started to wake up in the middle of the night, totally unaware and twice peed in my cats litter box and one night when my daughter slept with me due to a thunderstorm, she said that I was sleepwalking, which I’ve never done. So I lowered my dose back to 3.75 and I’m not having those symptoms. 

So my questions to all my lovely fellow narcoleptics, what is your story? When did you first start having symptoms. What lead you to your diagnosis? What is your cataplexy like? Does if differ from mine? I personally think having my kind of cataplexy is hilarious and makes me laugh more which causes more cataplexy. Being on my meds, it doesn’t happen as much… sometimes I get the feeling I could, but then the medication stops it from happening. Only once since I started taking my meds did the medication not prevent a full cataplexy episode and i literally fell to the floor at work laughing with my coworker. 

I am also curious to the vivid dreams… how often do you remember them? Can you recall multiple a night? Has anyone astral traveled or had OBE’s: either voluntarily or involuntarily? The only time I’ve experienced paralysis was during the time I tried to induce OBE’s at 21/22. But I was fully conscious the entire time. I recently discussed this with chatGBT, and it said that Tibetan monks practice years to be able to dream travel while in a fully conscious and meditative state and I am astonished I was able to achieve this within two weeks of practice. It makes me wonder if others like me can also do the same things! So please share as much as you’d like. ",2,1752285362.0,Narcolepsy,1,1.0,False

It was extremely scary and stressful. He's still in the hospital, thousands of miles from home but thankfully he's on the mend.

A week before we left, we had to euthanize our dog that had cancer for 8 months. Three weeks before being euthanized, we were sure he was doing okay, but two weeks later, he took a turn for the worse and his entire body was covered in open sores and had a very horrible leg ulceration that he was gnawing at. After talking to the vet and a specialist, it was decided that euthanasia was the best decision.

With all of that information, how on earth did I come home to my house a complete mess, my cat looking too skinny, over $300 worth of meat gone *and* the compost gate wide open? I am listing these in the order that I noticed because I got home at midnight after 24 straight hours of travel and more than that over 3 days. I don't know if I can even explain how every.single.thing in our house was moved or shoved into corner or moved in some weird way. The coffee maker was in a random cupboard where the plates *were* previously stored, but those were moved into the utensil drawer.  My closet had been gone through (they had no reason to go into my closet). My partner's work desk setup looked like someone took their arm and shoved everything to the side (I specifically told them not to touch his work desk). Etc. Then I see my cat. He's too skinny. I have worked with the vet to know exactly how to keep his weight exactly how it should be. 6 tablespoons a day. 2 in the morning, 2 in the afternoon, 2 at night. He looks like he's been missing the 2 tablespoons worth of food a day. Here's a good time to mention I made a 4 page reference manual detailing feeding times and amounts, where to find everything important in the house detailed per room, what can be used, what specific things you should know about each pet AND THEN, labeled each food storage area with the feeding information again. There is no way my cat should be looking skinny right now because before we left he was looking a bit chubby - I was giving too many treats to compensate for Pumpkin's death.

The next morning, I knew there'd be nothing to eat from the fridge, but no worries - we have canned and frozen foods...or we did. My partner and I get half a cow that lasts us over a year and saves money in the long run. Before we left, we showed  the house sitters our meat freezer and told them to ""feel free to eat whatever beef you want from this freezer."" I also told them to use spices and oils to as needed as well as anything from the fridge. I expect this is the norm for  anyone hosting people staying at their home. These people took AT LEAST 20lbs of ground beef, 1 brisket, 3 carne asada packs, 3 packs of ribs, and 5 packs of stew meat from freezer we invited them to. Then 1 sushi grade tuna fillet, 60oz of shrimp and 2 packages of  sausages from our kitchen freezer they were never invited to. On top of that, 10 cans of tuna, 6 cans of beans, 4 cans of diced tomatoes, 1 package of flour and a 4 pack of butter. They were at our home for 12 days. There is no way in hell 2 people ate all that meat in 12 days. I'm assuming they made chili at some point since they depleted my chili powder, that was full and found a huge empty bean container - left in a random corner. All that chili would've been enough to feed them for breakfast, lunch and dinner for 12 days alone. How the hell did they eat all the other things? They didn't. They 100% just loaded up their car with $300 worth of meat.

As I was cleaning the mess they left behind this next morning, I went to the compost bin. The gate wasn't just not closed. It was situated to make sure it's open. This was the hair that broke my damn back. I tried to excuse any of those other things away. Ok, they moved things. Ok, maybe I just think my cat looks skinny. Ok, they ate all the food, we did say they could eat some of it and maybe they went overboard. But the compost gate has me reeling. I told them Duke loves to get into things. That him getting into the compost bin could be fatal to him. I emphasized to them to make sure that gate is closed - and put it in the manual. This wasn't negligence, they propped the gate open and put him at harm, after they knew I just lost a dog. I am beyond pissed.

How do you, as a person with any conscience, know a family just lost their dog, know that family experienced a medical emergency in a different country, get 3 day's notice plans have changed while still getting paid the same, for less pets and time needed to watch, decide to then not do your minimal job requirement, rob them, and then say God Bless?

Hey there! I’m a 30-year-old creative in marketing with a dry sense of humor, an adventurous streak, and a knack for turning everyday moments into something worth remembering. I use a wheelchair for longer distances—but that’s just one part of the story. I’m independent, curious, and always up for something fun, meaningful, or wonderfully weird.



Perks of Dating Me:


	•	VIP Parking – Front-row access to life, baby.
	•	Skip the Line – Theme parks, concerts, events… we don’t do “waiting.”
	•	Endless Laughs – Wild injury stories that sound fake (but aren’t).
	•	Unexpected Wins – Free upgrades, kind strangers, and the occasional surprise dessert.
	•	Zombie Apocalypse Strategy – I may not outrun them, but I’m clever, calm under pressure, and hard to miss. That’s teamwork.
	•	You’ll Stand Out – Let’s be real—“normie” couples are overrated.
	•	Built-In Armrest – My chair’s side guards are cozy. You’re welcome.
	•	Strong Hands, Strong Heart – Years of pushing wheels and opening up emotionally.
	•	Creative Problem-Solving – I’m basically a MacGyver with wheels.
	•	Zero Time for Superficial BS – Life’s short. I keep it real and intentional.



A Bit More About Me


I’m all about storytelling—whether it’s through books, music, movies, games, or late-night conversations. I love collecting weird trivia, exploring overlooked places, and getting lost in good ideas.

I stay active in my own way: home workouts, nature walks, and traveling whenever I can. I’ve explored the U.S., Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and the Bahamas—and there’s still plenty more I’d love to experience. (Bonus: I speak Spanish, too!)

I’m the kind of person who notices the little things—your favorite song, how you take your coffee, the way you light up when you talk about something you love. I care deeply, listen closely, and show up consistently. Whether it’s building a playlist, discovering a local gallery, or just sharing quiet time, I value connection that feels grounded and genuine.

⸻

What I’m Looking For:

I’m drawn to people who are:

	•	Playful, grounded, and emotionally present
	•	Down to laugh, explore, and be real together
	•	Into thoughtful conversations and spontaneous fun
	•	Comfortable being fully, unapologetically themselves

I’m open to friendship, flirtation, or something more—whatever feels right. Long-distance, age gaps, different backgrounds—all are welcome. I’m attracted to all body types—connection and energy mean more to me than any one look.

Whatever we build, I just want it to feel real and mutual.



Why You Should Message Me:

If you’re looking for someone thoughtful, creative, and emotionally grounded—someone who values kindness, depth, and shared experiences—I’d genuinely love to hear from you.

No pressure. No expectations. Just an open door and a bit of curiosity.

If something here speaks to you, don’t be shy. Say hello, tell me something about you, and let’s see where the conversation takes us.



Let’s Make Memories:

Big trips, quiet nights, deep talks, shared playlists—I think the best connections are built on a little of everything. Whether you’re looking for something serious or just someone to connect with in an honest, easy way, you’re welcome here.

We’re married now.

The thought brought a small smile to my face as I turned to see you still asleep beside me, your breathing steady and peaceful. It was a simple moment, but it felt significant. The start of something new.

Not wanting to wake you just yet, I carefully slipped out of bed and made my way to the kitchen. Maybe I could surprise you with breakfast—though whether it would turn out edible was another story.

Cooking disaster – One of them tries to cook a romantic meal but forgets a key ingredient or burns something.

Lazy rainy day – They stay in pajamas all day, build a blanket fort, and watch old movies.

First big purchase – They go furniture shopping and struggle to agree on a couch or dining table.

Surprise date night – One plans a surprise date, but it doesn't go exactly as intended (maybe they get lost or the restaurant loses their reservation).

Lost wedding ring scare – One panics after misplacing their wedding ring, only to find it in a silly place.

Pet adoption – They consider adopting a pet and visit a shelter, debating over a dog, cat, or something else.

DIY home project gone wrong – They try to assemble furniture or paint a room together, but it turns into chaos.

Meeting the in-laws – A family member makes an unexpected visit, leading to some awkward or funny moments. Here are some ideas for that to add to it.

Game night rivalry – They have a friendly but competitive board game or video game night, and things get hilariously intense.

Morning routine differences – One is an early riser, the other loves to sleep in, leading to amusing compromises.

Holiday decorating – They have different opinions on how to decorate for the holidays, leading to a fun mini-feud.

Surprise gift exchange – They both try to find the perfect small gift for each other and end up with funny or touching results.

Midnight snack runs – They sneak out late at night in pajamas to grab ice cream or fast food.

1lxocll,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaggiaclassic/comments/1lxocll/my_experience_with_the_gaggimate_install/,My Experience with the GaggiMate Install,"Hi everyone,

I wanted to share my experience with installing the GaggiMate mod in the hope that it helps others make a more informed decision.

First and foremost, I want to acknowledge the developers and community behind GaggiMate. They’ve been incredibly helpful and responsive throughout the entire process - especially given that I’m quite new to this and was likely asking some very basic questions. The team has gone out of their way to provide support, including wiring diagrams and troubleshooting advice, and I really appreciate their patience and dedication. This post is not intended as criticism of them or their efforts - rather, it’s a personal reflection and a way for me to process the experience.

Why I Chose GaggiMate

I was originally inspired to go down this path after watching Lance Hedrick’s video praising the GaggiMate mod. The idea of getting Gaggia Classic Pro with such powerful functionality - without the price tag of a Decent Espresso machine - was very appealing. I also liked the Gaggia’s compact size and colour options.

Lance mentioned the installation was easy, but I think it’s important to note that he’s highly experienced with wiring and modifications. For someone without that background, the process is far more complex than it may appear.

Choosing a Mod

I was weighing up between the Gaggiuino, GaggiMate, and a basic PID with dimmer mod. If I could do it over, I’d probably go with the basic GaggiMate kit or a PID/dimmer mod instead. They're simpler, more stable, and much more affordable - especially since most of my difficulties stemmed from modifying the internal plumbing. If you're looking for full programmability, I’d honestly suggest investing in a more advanced machine from the start and perhaps just using a smart plug for scheduling.

Early Adoption Considerations

GaggiMate is still in its prototype stage, and while it offers great potential and features, it also comes with the risks typical of early-stage projects. When you purchase it, you acknowledge that it’s a work in progress - and understandably, that means it may affect your machine’s warranty. If your machine is brand new or under warranty, it’s worth thinking carefully before making irreversible changes.

While the system is improving all the time, I would personally suggest waiting a few more years until the platform has matured. Many features are still being fine-tuned, and the user experience reflects that.

Installation Challenges

The entire installation took over a month, during which I couldn’t use my coffee machine - a big inconvenience in a coffee-loving household. I could have removed and reinstalled the mod to continue using the machine in the meantime, but that would’ve been an even bigger effort.

Since my machine was only six months old, everything was still tight and difficult to disassemble. A few specific challenges I encountered included:

Missing Parts: The yellow relay cables weren’t included in my kit, which held things up for 2-3 weeks.
Screen Troubleshooting: My first screen wasn’t recognised by the PCB or my laptop. Troubleshooting required tools I didn’t own - like a multimeter - which I had to buy separately.
Support Limitations: While the Discord community is helpful, it’s not a formal support system with local repair professionals. At one point, I was advised to solder a connection myself, which was beyond my comfort zone and skills. In the end, I had to buy a replacement screen at my own cost. To be clear, this isn’t the devs’ fault - parts sourced from overseas can sometimes have quality inconsistencies.
Design and Build Reflections

Working inside the Gaggia Classic Pro is no small task, especially for someone without prior experience. Routing wires and replacing hoses was slow and challenging. While my kit did include the required hose clamps, I wish there had been a few spares - one clamp damaged the OEM hose during tightening, which caused leaks and required extra adjustments.

After finishing the install, I was proud. I had genuinely achieved something I never thought I could, and I wanted to show it off. But that feeling faded when issues began popping up:

Screen Mounting: The screen would often fall off with the slightest touch. Eventually, the housing cracked and had to be held in place with tape. My partner became hesitant to use the machine, worried it might break. I know some users have printed their own improved housings, but I don’t own a 3D printer, and local options couldn’t print the size I needed.
PCB Placement: The board is unsealed (not water proof) and placed inside the machine - right next to water pipes and funnel. This is risky in a moisture-heavy environment. It’s also bulky, making installation tight. Mounting it externally might be safer in some setups, though I understand that could affect aesthetics depending on your kitchen.
PID Autotune Issues: During autotune testing, the water tube disconnected while the boiler was at 140°C - dangerous and hard to deal with safely. I tightened it and ran the test again, but this time the machine reached 160°C without pressure. It raised real concerns about what safeguards are in place to prevent damage or safety issues in case of a fault.
Final Thoughts

The GaggiMate concept is brilliant, and the community support is generous and active. But in my opinion, the system isn't quite ready for casual or novice users. It demands a fair amount of technical knowledge, patience, and a willingness to troubleshoot - and potentially repair - on your own.

That said, I’ve learned a lot. The process taught me about wiring, electronics, and how espresso machines function. That knowledge is valuable, and I genuinely appreciate the time and effort the devs and Discord community put into helping users like me.

However, one thing I want to caution others about: once you’ve heavily modified your machine, most licensed technicians won’t touch it. It becomes too costly or time-consuming to repair. If something goes wrong, your options are limited to DIY fixes or the hope that someone local is willing to help. I’ve been lucky to find someone willing to look at mine, but I admit the whole experience has left me a bit disheartened.

After spending around $1,200 Aud and ending up with a machine not working and a lot of frustration, I’ve decided to return my Gaggia to stock configuration. If you’re considering the mod, I’d suggest either:

Waiting until the project is more mature

1lxobep,https://www.reddit.com/r/Tik_tok_stories/comments/1lxobep/a_niagara_vacation/,A Niagara vacation,"
 It was so terribly cold. Snow was falling, and it was almost dark, when out of the blue, my wife called me at work. ""We're going to Niagara Falls for the weekend. I got us an awesome deal!""

We had both been working at our first ""full-fledged"" jobs for a year and had reached that moment after graduation when you suddenly realize you can't make that impact on the world your student enthusiasm once promised. At first, I just sighed. It was the dead of January, and I had already expended all my energy on a week of inconsequential stress. I just wanted to collapse on the couch for two days. Sarah felt a similar weary exhaustion. I could tell. Her tone was more hopeful than excited, but she had dreaded the routine we were sinking into and was trying her best to pull us free.

I looked to the ceiling and adjusted my telephone headset. At that time I was working at Stats Canada on the tele-query desk. I took a deep breath and, as convincingly as possible, said, ""Sounds good."" I don't think she bought it, but we went nonetheless.

This was Niagara Falls before the casinos when there was a very distinct off-season. When we got to the hotel, we were given the details of our ""lovers' special"". One dinner to be used either Friday or Saturday, two breakfasts, a roll of tokens for the arcade, 10% off some ""4D"" movie ride experience, and a 2-for-1 coupon to Max Tussaud's. I guessed it was Madame's nephew? We also got a bottle of sparkling wine in our room and chocolate treats on our pillows. I was impressed. It sounded good.

When we got into our room and saw the ""bottle"" of wine - basically an aeroplane-sized glass and half - and the chocolates - ""fun wrapped"" Oh Henry's left over from Halloween - we both started to laugh. The tone for two wonderful days had been set. We decided to cash in on our dinner coupon right away.

The restaurant off the lobby had hopes of being better. There were huge panoramic windows that promised a view of the gorge. Unfortunately, they had some winter moisture problems that day, and it felt like we were defrosting amid the dripping streaks and foggy patches. The decor was your standard booths and tables though the ""romantic"" lighting was unique. Dollar store battery-powered tea lights were lodged inside thick tumbler glasses and shed a muted pleasantness in a ""what a great idea for a craft"" sort of way. I had a feeling they were created by our waitress since she was the one who always seemed to be fussing with them. Only one other couple was in the dining room, so she attended to us immediately.

""Can I get you something to start?""

""Sure."" ""Thank you, that would be nice."" We both responded simultaneously.

""And what would the lady like this evening?""

Sarah smiled at the flattery. ""I think I'll have a glass of white wine."" She glanced over at me to see my reaction. This was a subtle cue of the mood to follow. Diet Coke was usually the beverage of choice. She didn't normally drink alcohol. One glass numbed her nose and made her giggle far too easily. When she did drink, however, it meant she was comfortable with my company and open to anything to follow. I raised my eyebrows in a debonair way.

""And for the gentleman?""

""Do you have Foster's on tap?""

""Yes we do.""

""I'll have a pint please.""

Sarah smiled at the happy memories I invoked. At university, Foster's was my signature beer. It was at a time when Crocodile Dundee was a known name, and Australia was inexplicably cool. 15 cent buffalo wings and a pitcher of Foster's was the Tuesday night special at the London Arms pub. There the Classics Club would meet and, as a group, circle the wagons and drink ourselves into extroverts.

As soon as the waitress left, Sarah smiled at me. She reached out and held my hand across the table. With my gaze on hers, she slipped her foot from her shoe and slowly began sliding it up my pant leg.

""I got a pedicure this morning."" She announced seductively.

I nodded and pretended I didn't notice her invitation. ""What colour?"" I asked.

""I'm not telling."" She teased. ""You'll just have to find out later."" Her devious little smile was gorgeous.

""Mmmm. I can't wait.""

When the waitress returned with our drinks, we immediately retreated to our personal spaces as if we had been discovered by the chaperone. Sarah opened the menu and began to salivate at the variety.

""Can we add an appetizer to the package dinner?"" Her question seemed innocent enough.

""You're on the package?"" Our friendly waitress disappeared, and we were no longer a lady or a gentleman. She ripped the menu out of Sarah's hand and took mine before I had even opened it. She then scurried to her podium and brought back a tattered, grease-stained, photocopied page that we had to share. We both burst out laughing.

The waitress was flustered that we were not as bothered as she was. ""The drinks are NOT included!""

""What choices do we have?"" I asked, expecting the usual chicken or fish. I had been on many packages before with my parents.

""Coffee or tea."" The waitress snapped.

Sarah and I looked at each other in amused disbelief.

""I'll have coffee please."" I didn't even flinch at the ridiculously limited package. I was eager to get my order in early.

""And I'll have the tea!"" Sarah followed my lead. ""Can I have some milk with that?""

""Yes."" The waitress snarled.

""Fantastic!"" I enthused.

""Yes, great! I'm glad we got the package, Honey."" Sarah joked.

The waitress stormed off and returned sometime later with our lettuce-only salads drowned in Kraft's Italian dressing and our chewy chicken dinners, which she had thoughtfully allowed to cool. She tossed the plates on the table and left us to peacefully devour our deal. We didn't see her again until we requested the bill. For some reason, we found it amusing to leave a generous tip, which of course, defeated the purpose of the package, but we didn't care. It was fun.

The rest of the holiday was marred with similar off-season products and services. The wax museum was only half open, so we couldn't see the pop stars of the seventies. I didn't think it was a problem, but Sarah pouted playfully. She really wanted to see young Bowie. Meanwhile, the arcade was particularly stingy about spitting out coupons. So much so that Mike, the scraggly-haired repair guy, ended up escorting us from game to game and repairing the devices on demand. In no time, he was acting like an old drinking buddy. He joked and laughed, then, out of the blue, revealed that working at the Niagara Falls Fun Centre wasn't his career choice, that his dream was to be part of a travelling carnival. He desperately wanted to see more of the world, he explained and socialize with a greater variety of ""wildlife."" Mike winked at Sarah to punctuate his meaning, then began advising her on which games to play.

Sarah was partial to Skee ball and clearly had career potential in the sport, but Mike quickly pointed out that the token-to-coupon payout was not the best. In a furtive whisper, he revealed that The Storm Stopper was your best bet, provided the arcade had left it on its original factory settings. He assured us the ones here were ""cool."" The game had lights that ran around the outside in opposite directions and you had to hit the button at just the right spot to win. It looked impossible, but Mike was right; if you calculated tokens in versus coupons won, it was the best deal. It only took a little practice to win a minor jackpot every 5 or 6 times.

We would cheer each win as if Toronto had won the Stanley Cup. I would give a quick fist pump and a full lung ""Yes!"" while Sarah would jump up and down screaming, ""WhoooHooo!"" Of course, in the end, when we cashed in, ""Mike's secret"" only bumped us up from a key-chain flashlight to a ""deluxe"" nail beauty set. Mind you, it did come complete with clippers, scissors, a file AND a cuticle scraper. Not only that, it was all neatly packaged in a paisley-patterned pink and green plastic vinyl case. Mike was so pleased to give us our prize and to be honest, we were thrilled to win it if only to see his broad chicletted smile. It was more of a trophy than a grooming set.

That night, I made reservations for us at a fancy Chinese food restaurant - the Bamboo Garden. When we arrived, we had half-expected renovations of some sort. Instead, the place was immaculate. Gentle pools teeming with goldfish highlighted the epic black and red Ming dynasty decor. Real candles flickered on crisp white tablecloths. Again, the restaurant was virtually ours. The reservations on my part were entirely unnecessary. In fact, as soon as we entered, they knew us by name and guided us directly to our table. A live lounge piano caressed the air, its notes danced vaguely around familiar harmonies until finally, as if prompted by our presence, a song emerged immediately accompanied by the velvet voice of oriental karaoke.

1lxoac9,https://i.redd.it/h3qifwh2kccf1.png,The Internet Got Real: What I Learned from Meeting My Monad Family in Athens,"I'd like to talk a bit about the Nad’s Monad Meet-Up in Athens, Greece, an experience I'm sure you've heard talking about constantly on twitter and within the discord but it was awesome and I’m still buzzing from the experience. This wasn’t just a casual hangout. It was electric. It was emotional. It was *real.* People from every corner of the globe came together in a foreign city, people of different cultures, backgrounds, ages, vibes all came together in one wild city to celebrate the thing that connects us: this wild, wonderful community we’ve built online. Monad.

There was nervousness at first. At first I saw a handful of Nads clinging to the comfort of already-established local friends. But then the recognition started to occur. The familiar handle, a funny Monad shirt, the quick twitter check or seeing a PFP that you've chatted with 4000 times. That first handshake or hug with someone you’ve only known through DMs and Discord? Unreal. The jokes about “touching Nads” took on new meaning, because as hilarious as that is, there’s truth behind it. Human connection *matters.* And when you finally meet face to face with people you’ve talked to every day for months or even years, something powerful happens. You feel it in your chest. It's a spark. It’s warmth. It’s life*.* An excitement and an energy.

The energy was infectious. The conversations were deep, weird, hilarious, surprising. I had great conversations and made real friendships, many I didn't want to end and am excited to continue again. I left wishing the meetup lasted a whole week. Maybe a month. We often say “touch grass” around here as a meme, but I think we’re onto something. We spend so much of our lives bouncing between screens. We spend our days working on a medium sized screen while intermittently  checking our small screen only to reward ourselves by watching our big screen. The repetition is calming and hypnotic and can very easily make days blur together. But getting outside, meeting people, having real experiences? That’s what charges your soul.

Some of the Nads I talked to said this weekend was the first time they’d done something like this.  For some, it was the first time they’d felt truly seen in a while. That hit me hard. Because it reminded me that while online community is amazing, it’s only half the magic. The other half lives out here, with true face to face and eye to eye contact, shared meals, belly laughs, and long talks at 2AM under foreign stars, techno music and sandy beaches.

So here’s my point, whether you were with us in Athens or not, we should all aim to take the spirit of the Monad Meet-Up and bring it home*.* Be a leader. Start a local hangout. A coffee meet-up. A whatever, even keep it in theme, a Monad mini-meet. Doesn’t have to be 120 people like in Greece. It can be three people in your city. Or even just *one* new person you connect with offline. That’s where it starts and it can build from there.

Because when we step away from our screens and into the world, we’re not just enriching our own lives, we’re improving the very communities we go back to online. We grow. We get better. And so does everyone around us.

We built something beautiful in Athens. Now let’s keep building.

ALL IN ONE

I stood there, holding my fucking coffee, which tasted like fuck, staring out the fucking window at absolutely fuck. No birds, no sky, just fuck. Even the trees were like, “Fuck.” So I took a fucking breath, the kind of fuck deep breath that fills your whole fuckchest with fuckair, and I told myself, “Okay. Fuck it.” Then I tripped over my own foot  that dumb fucking fuck and spilled my coffee on my pants, which were already covered in yesterday’s fuck because I forgot to do laundry like a complete fuck of a functioning adult. So I changed into different pants, found a different mug, and gave the day another fuck. But every time I tried to move forward, I hit another wall of fuck. Lost my keys? Fuck. Microwave screamed? Double fuck. Forgot why I walked into the room? Infinite recursive fuck. And yet, somehow, every single fuck that happened just layered itself onto the other fucks like sedimentary fuckrock, building a monument to one long, continuous, god tier, immaculate fucking fuck of a day. Not bad, not good, just fuck. Raw, unfiltered, uncut  the kind of fuck that doesn’t mean anything anymore but also means everything if you squint at it long enough through the fog of your own fucking fuckery.

1lxo79h,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1lxo79h,Layali Coffee House - A Long Overdue Thank You,"Hello Rochester,

My name is Ibrahim, and I’m one of the four owners of Layali Coffee House.

We’ve been open for a while now, and honestly, this post is long overdue. Between running the shop, making sure every cup feels like home, and raising a family, I never sat down to properly say what’s been on my heart:

Thank you.

Layali started as a dream shared between four friends. As someone who was born in Rochester and is proud to call Rochester home, it was important to me that we build something meaningful, not just a business, but a place that reflects the warmth and spirit of this city.

We didn’t want to be just another coffee shop. We wanted to be that cozy spot you walk into when you need a breather, a place where nurses unwind after night shifts, where students write papers, and where you always feel seen, whether it’s your first visit or your fiftieth.

We’re incredibly grateful for the support this city has shown us so far. But we also know we can do more.

So here’s us, finally posting, and saying:
**We’re all ears.**

If you’ve got thoughts, complaints, compliments, or suggestions, whether it’s ideas on how we can give back more to the community, or just how we can make your drink better, we’re listening. Seriously.

Rochester is more than where we opened shop. It’s home. And we want to grow with you, serve you, and keep showing up in the ways that matter.

Thank you again, for every visit, every kind word, every second chance.

With love,
– Ibrahim ",88,1752283794.0,Rochester,9,0.94,False

We were inspired by similar coffee shop concepts that are already successful in Middle Eastern countries. However, this combination of a laundry shop and café, with an added entertainment element, hasn't been done in the Philippines yet. We could be the first to introduce it here.

I have experience running my own laundry shop, where we earned an average of ₱6,000 per day, depending on location. That translates to ₱180,000 to ₱220,000 monthly revenue with a 70% profit margin just from laundry services alone.

What I’ve noticed is that many laundry businesses rely heavily on pickups and deliveries. With this new concept, we can attract more walk-in customers by giving them a reason to visit the shop, stay, and enjoy their time. The sandbox with remote-controlled tractors will be a fun attraction, especially for families, and it sets us apart from traditional laundry services.

I believe this concept is unique enough to be registered or trademarked in the Philippines, potentially giving us legal protection and even licensing opportunities if others want to replicate the idea.

On top of that, I’m a digital marketing specialist by profession, so you wouldn’t need to hire a separate marketer. I can handle the branding, advertising, and online presence to ensure the business gains traction quickly.

I'm passionate about this project and confident in its potential. I'm looking for a like-minded partner or investor to make this vision a reality.

dropping $80K on a Cybertruck as a 'disability aid' and pet carrier when you could do a full custom van build out with more reliability, accessibility, and utility while also pretending it's not a rolling billboard for Nazi fanboys is wild.

1lxo3l0,https://www.reddit.com/r/adviceph/comments/1lxo3l0/pabirthday_ko_na_siguro_ito_sa_sarili_ko/,Pa-Birthday ko na siguro ito sa sarili ko.,"Problem/Goal: Kahit ngayon na birthday ko, di na siya nag greet. Ilang days na rin kaming walang communication. 

Context: 2 years and 10 months yung relationship namin dalawa. He was so nice back then ( especially nung nanliligaw palang siya ) , Sobrang dali niya kausap and akala ko noon hindi niya magagawa yung mga ginagawa ng ex ko noon. 

3 months after ko siyang sagutin, He changed. Pag pakiramdam ko na hindi ako okay, and feeling ko inaanxiety ako bigla bigla na lang akong umiiyak, At first magaask siya like "" oh bat ka umiiyak "" and sinasabi ko "" wala, hindi ko alam ""  hanggang sa sasabihin niya na "" anxiety mo mukha mo "" . 

sa loob ng 1 month, ilang beses kami magaaway and mag mamakaawa ako na wag niya ako iwan. May 1 christmas kami na nagaway kami or nagkatampuhan tapos nakipaghiwalay. 

Nagaaway kami before rinig ng buong tropa niya kung ano pinagaawayan namin. Naglalaro kami ng ML noon ramdam ko na di na lang siya yung galit sa akin noon  ( bruuuh, newbie lang ako naglalaro ng ml. kung baga saling pusa lang ako ) Tapos ganun na. 

sobrang daming nanyari.  Hanggang sa may isang araw na napagod ako as in, Nawalan ako ng nararamdaman sa kanya. Pagod physical nararamdaman ko kase nung araw na yun sobrang busy. Nakipaghiwalay siya, 

Nung nakipaghiwalay siya, ilang araw para padin akong blanko sa nararamdamn ko. Hanggang sa nakipagusap ako online, like kwentuhan lang walang keme keme na magkakasomething. 

pero, 1 week pa lang kami wala nun, pumayag ako makipag coffee dat doon sa nakilala ko. Ang pagkakaalam ko friendly date lang pero ilang days pa lang parang nagiging attached na ako or na fafall ( i know mabilis ) . Pero sinasabi ko doon sa nakilala ko na di pa ako okay, ganyan. Pero gusto niya magstay. 

hanggang sa kinausap ko ex ko, mahal niya daw ako. Magbabago na siya and pinaalam ko yung mga nanyari nung walang kami.  

Bumalik ako sa ex ko, pero nag cheat na ako sakanya because iniistalk ko pa yung guy. 
Ilang beses ko ginawa ang pag iinstalk. hanggang sa tumigil ako. ( friends padin kami nung guy sa socmed , nagchachat siya minsan pero never ko nireplyan )

Dami pang nanyari, dati naririnig ko na na pinaguusapan din nila yung ex niya before na sabi niya na once na maghiwalay yung ex niya at boyfriend nun sana bumalik. ( nagbibigay kase yun, taga ibang bansa ) 

Never niya pinaglaban relationship namin, siguro its time na to let it go na. Pa birthday ko na siguro talaga to sa sarili ko. 
Pagod na ako kumapit e, at lumaban pa.  




previous attempt: Wala, wala na akong balak kausapin pa. If di niya talaga ako babatiin today wala na talaga. Enough na lahat. Lahat ng nanyari, mga nasabi, at mga ginawa. ",1,1752283497.0,adviceph,3,1.0,False

He left on a Friday.
Packed his belongings and took the car,
left one shirt,
a chipped coffee mug,
and a poster for Jaws,
as if a life could be reduced to what fits
in the back seat of a Honda Civic.
As if love was just the things you choose
to leave behind.

I cried until my world became an ocean,
salt-blind, gasping,
each sob a wave that threatened to swallow me whole.
And in that darkness,
they came circling:
not memories,
but shapes.
Predators.
Ghosts.

All the men before him
who never asked who I was,
only what I could hold.
What I could give.
What I could take without breaking.

They saw me as
the soft container for their hunger,
a body-shaped absence
where they could pour their want
and call it connection.

How many hands have mapped my skin
like a country to be conquered?
How many eyes have skimmed past my gaze
to find the fantasy behind my face?

I have been muse,
museum piece,
trophy,
bandage,
altar,
and apology.

Everything
except the breathing,
dreaming,
hoping woman
standing barefoot in the wreckage
of another man’s unfinished idea of love.
