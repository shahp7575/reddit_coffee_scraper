1g3ji6p,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskPsychiatry/comments/1g3ji6p/unbearably_frantic_lately_to_the_point_where/,"Unbearably frantic lately, to the point where others have noticed (21F)","I (21F) have been experiencing troubling symptoms for about a month now. I feel wired, like I am plugged into a constant energy source. My thoughts are all jumbled up. It makes it hard to talk to people or to focus on things happening in the moment. I feel really jittery, almost like my bones are vibrating in my body. I don't know if this shaking is visible to other people though. I feel over-caffeinated even when I have had none. I am trying to avoid interacting with other people because I feel like I just ramble and rattle off whatever is in my head, and I think that can come across as pretty off-putting.

Oftentimes my heart will start to race and I have a hard time catching my breath, sometimes it will be severe enough where I can write it off as a panic attack (which I used to significantly struggle from when I was a teen), but other times it just seems like an underlying sensation that I can kind of tune out.

Emotionally, I'm in a pretty good place and I'm feeling pretty optimistic and content about things. I'm really prone to severe depressive phases, so I am pretty relieved that those feelings aren't' present. However, I have seen a massive spike in my anxiety. It's unbearable. I have also been way more impatient and grumpy than usual, which is strange as normally I am a very laid back person. It's really the anxiety though that is hurting me.

Early into when these symptoms started appearing, about mid-September, I was experiencing sleep disruptions where I would wake up multiple times in the middle of the night, oftentimes anxious. That hasn't happened as much lately, and I am sleeping mostly fine, except I had two nights this week where I got¬†*maybe*¬†an hour and a half of sleep, and not even that could help clear my system. Like I said, it just feels like I am perpetually over-caffeinated, even when I have had no caffeine.

I am at a loss. I am trying to get myself to chill out, focus on my art, do yoga, lay off the coffee (which I have been drinking for years and years), because I feel like other people are noticing that I've seemed pretty wired lately, and like I said, I've been isolating myself as a result. This has happened before, people have mentioned it before, but it usually doesn't stick around for this long long, only a few days to a week. Other than some social drinks once or twice a week, I do not use any substances.

I think that what I am experiencing is psychological, but I just don't know how to fix it. I just want to get back to feeling normal again. Any help would be appreciated! Thanks!",1,1728922145.0,AskPsychiatry,0,1.0,False

1g3jfuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CleaningTips/comments/1g3jfuf/mattress_spill_turn_bad_smell/,Mattress spill turn bad smell,"Last week, I spill coffee on my mattress. I wiped and let it dried. There was a coffee sweet smell left over. I fear it might attract ants so I took my clothing stain remover spray and a wash towel to clean the area. I blow dry it for a while and then left it to air dry. After it dried, the leftover smell was freaking awful. The best I could describe it, is a moldy urine smell or just a bad damp moldy smell. 

After searching up some subject on this, I took a portion water and vinegar n spray the area. I left it for an hour and came back, the smell is still there and some vinegar smell. So I added some baking soda - using my hand to spread and press it into the mattress. I am asking in case whatever I do, doesn‚Äôt work. Anybody got tips on how to remove the smell? 

Edit - n in case anyone has the idea - this is a heavy foam mattress (5year + old) n I live in an apartment so no way can I drag this item to be sun tan for smell removal ",1,1728921978.0,CleaningTips,0,1.0,False
1g3jffz,https://www.reddit.com/r/royalcaribbean/comments/1g3jffz/fyi_regarding_coffeestarbucks_on_independence_of/,FYI Regarding coffee/Starbucks on Independence of the Seas (as of 10/24),"I am just imparting this information because I was entirely unaware of this before we sailed. (Despite having researched the UBP heavily.) Apparently (as of Oct 2024) there is only one coffee shop on Independence of the Seas. It is called ""Cafe Promenade"" as it's outer signage, but when you walk inside the coffee shop you see Starbucks coffee menu signage. We had the UBP and I knew from research that you can get coffees at the ship's coffee shop, but not at Starbucks. I was afraid I'd get charged, but the man assured me it was included as they are not a ""licensed Starbucks"". So I enjoyed iced Americanos, lattes, cappucinos, machiatos, and just a shot of espresso here and there all week. I am not a frappuccino kinda gal, but I saw plenty of people getting those as well. They don't have the seasonal offerings, but have caramel, vanilla, and hazelnut syrups. When on land & living my normal life I only get Starbucks about 2-3x a month, so this was quite the treat for me!

Also, I didn't discover until the last day that Windjammer's bar has an espresso machine, and you can order espresso drinks from there. We just always hit up the Cafe Promenade in the morning before going to Windjammer. My husband is a morning person and I am not, so he would go down there with both of our cards and get our morning drinks.

So whether you were considering the UBP, the refreshment package, or the 10 coffee card for an Independence of the Seas sailing, I hope this is helpful! Just to reiterate, this knowledge is specific to Independence of the Seas ONLY, I have no knowledge of other ships.

1g3jew2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1g3jew2/rf_eulogy/,[RF] Eulogy,"During the lifeless hours that precede dawn‚Äôs light, within a plain hospital room, a man sat next to his dying mother. The footsteps of lone nurses walking between patients bounced off white-washed walls like empty ghosts, barely audible even in such all-encompassing quiet. Within the room all was quiet save for slow, smooth breathing, and the soft hum of machines working tirelessly to keep her alive. The air was still and tepid, smelling of harsh hospital sterilization mixed with the subdued musk of sickness and death. The man was hunched over, clutching a hand so frail and cold, yet still faintly pulsed with the beat of life.

Like a statue rising to life, the man stirred. Adjusting his chair, he swallowed past a dry throat and said, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôll be okay Mom, it‚Äôs almost over.‚Äù

His mother, deep within medicine-induced slumber, gave no sign of recognition. The man stared blankly at the wall, eyes glazed with memories of the past. Without looking away he whispered, ‚ÄúI hope you can hear me. Doc Kelly said you probably can‚Äôt, but I hope you can. I‚Ä¶‚Äù

He let his head drop like a stone, gazing blankly into the cold tile floor. Several times he began to speak, tried to find the right words. Eventually he took a deep breath and said, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs so much to tell you about. So much I wish I said before. I-I-‚Äú his voice quivered, ‚ÄúI wish I had talked to you more. That I hadn‚Äôt pushed you away. I‚Äôm sorry I wasn‚Äôt‚Ä¶ that ‚Ä¶‚Äù he stopped, slowly closing his mouth, defeated. Holding back a truth he could not bear to say, or to hear.

For a while silence reigned. How much time passed he did not know. There was a clock on the wall behind him, each tick keeping step for Time‚Äôs endless march, but he could not muster the energy to care. Time seemed irrelevant in the face of death‚Äôs inevitability. Slowly, a sad smile grew on his face as memories of days long past tricked into his mind.

Planting a small kiss on her hand he said, ‚ÄúYou did so good Mom, *so* good. Better than anyone expected, I think. No one would have been surprised you struggled or needed help, but you didn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs amazing, you‚Äôre amazing.‚Äù He paused, and softly chuckled.

¬†‚ÄúWe made some pretty good memories, didn‚Äôt we? Remember when we visited that apple orchard by the Thompson‚Äôs place, and James fell out of the tree ‚Äòcause of how many apples he was trying to hold?‚Äù he said, shaking his head. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm convinced the only reason he didn‚Äôt break anything was the apples cushioned his fall. Or, or all the times you forced us to go caroling around the neighborhood. I was so annoyed about it at the time but looking back, I‚Äôm glad we did.‚Äù His smile slowly suffocated, dwindling down to a pained grin. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm, sorry we didn‚Äôt go with you more. We were so excited when you let us decide if we wanted to go, I don‚Äôt think any of us saw how much it mattered to you. I‚Äôm just now realizing how much it mattered to me.‚Äù He said, eyes beginning to glisten. Looking to her face he brushed a lock of hair behind her ear and whispered, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry. If I could I‚Äôd sing with you for as long as you wanted.‚Äù Dropping his gaze he guiltily looked to the floor and said, ‚ÄúI guess it‚Äôs a little late for that now.‚Äù

A heavy silence hung around the room, stifling the man‚Äôs thoughts, his voice. Guilt, regret, and sorrow flanked his heart, gripping it with enough force it felt ready to burst.

Memories of times long past‚Ä¶

*Baking in their kitchen, flour strewn across every surface and caked along their cheeks.*

*Evenings spent playing with James and Adam in the living room, her crotchet needles clacking back and forth, a ceaseless staccato beat.*

*Her look of overwhelming pride and joy at each of their weddings, the tears on each of their faces as they danced with her across the floor.*

*Her look of somber acceptance as one by one they grew into their own lives, separate from hers.*

‚Ä¶flew through his mind, bringing waves of joy and regret. She had been so full of love for them. A debt they had tried to pay back knowing full well it could never be done.

And now, pretenses stripped away by Death and truths extracted by Time, he wondered if they had ever really tried at all.

Tears began to fill his eyes, one by one. Faced with the reality that he had never said it when it mattered, the man spoke his truth in a voice thick with emotion. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry for not being a better son, and for not seeing that you loved me anyway.‚Äù

Dam of emotion now broken; the man quietly wept. Wishing fervently that he could go back and give his mother everything she deserved and more. Weeping all the more at the futility of such a wish.

There they sat for time indeterminable. A woman within the void of sleep and a man suffused with emotion. The man cried until only dry gasps remained, emotion pouring out until he felt hollow and weak. Looking around the room, it was all suddenly too much to bear. The smells, the feelings, the uncaring utilitarian design, he had to get away.

Springing up he was halfway to the door when he turned, casting a pained glance at the faded remnant he called ‚Äòmom‚Äô. Any longer in this room and he would go crazy, but if she died while he was gone‚Ä¶ he would never forgive himself. Leaning into the hallway he desperately up and down the hall for looked for someone, anyone. A wave of relief rushed over him as he saw a nurse walking away from him, olive skin melding with the dim light.

‚ÄúMiss!‚Äù he called out, in what was hopefully a suitably quiet voice. As he quickly walked towards her, she turned, warm look spread across her face.

‚ÄúCan I help you with something Hun?‚Äù she said, face wrinkled through decades of joy and laughter.

‚ÄúWould you, would you watch my mom in, uh, room 305?‚Äù he asked. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to leave her alone but I‚Ä¶‚Äù he gave a pained look. ‚ÄúI need some fresh air.‚Äù

The nurse nodded in understanding. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a coffee station and a door outside if you take a right at the end of the hall. I‚Äôll come get you if she starts to pass.‚Äù

The man bowed his head. ‚ÄúThank you so much, I‚Äôll only be ten, fifteen at most.‚Äù He said, walking quietly down the hall. At its end there was indeed a small station with coffee of dubious quality, and paper cups to contain it. Steaming cup in hand, he slipped through the metal door leading outside, its aging hinges squealing in protest.

Cold, crisp air flowed over his skin, blissfully fresh. Taking a deep breath, the man noticed he wasn‚Äôt alone in seeking reprieve. Though dawn had not yet chased away the dregs of night, there was enough light for the man to see a woman in her mid-late 30‚Äôs leaned against the hospital wall, lit cigarette clasped between her fingers. Exchanging a mutual nod of greeting she asked, ‚ÄúGets to be a bit much, doesn‚Äôt it.‚Äù

The man gave a grim smile. ‚ÄúYes, it does. I‚Äôm Tony.‚Äù

A long drag preceded her answer of, ‚ÄúMonica. You want a light?‚Äù

Tony waved her off. ‚ÄúQuit a year or so ago, trying to not give myself a chance at starting back up. Thanks though.‚Äù

Monica nodded, and for a time they both enjoyed their hand-held solace in respectful silence.

‚ÄúTony, huh?‚Äù Monica said, voice surprisingly smooth given her chosen substance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs it short for?‚Äù

Tony chuckled. ‚ÄúNothing. Just plain ol‚Äô Tony. My mom always said it was a fine enough name on its own. She liked to keep things simple like that.‚Äù

Monica took a deep inhale, breathing out a cloud of smoke and watching it fade into the dismal air. ‚ÄúShe sounds nice. Simple,‚Äù she snorted, ‚ÄúWish I could say the same.

Eyebrow raised, Tony took a sip of coffee, reluctant to pressure her to elaborate. No pressure was required, as Monica looked over at him with a dry expression and said, ‚ÄúShe did NOT like it simple, that‚Äôs for sure. She didn‚Äôt abandon me, but I definitely cooked dinner for myself more than she did. I learned the wonders of butter, hot water, and noodles at a *very* young age.‚Äù

She smirked and shook her head, inhaling once more from her cigarette. ‚ÄúNo, she was too busy clubbing with money we didn‚Äôt have and going out with guys she was better off staying away from. Not exactly the best role model for little ol‚Äô Monica. She‚Äôs the one who got me hooked on these to begin with.‚Äù She said, gesturing with the cigarette.

A lull in the conversation grew while Tony nursed coffee that tasted like dirt but warmed him all the same. He was about to break the silence himself when Monica continued, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs funny though. Here, now, looking back? All the ways she failed aren‚Äôt really what I remember.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong I think plenty about her mistakes, but mostly I remember all the ways she still tried to make me happy. Painting our nails together, ‚ÄòMuffin Mondays‚Äô, a jacket or shirt she knew I wanted.‚Äù She paused, looking down with an expression halfway between a grimace and a smile. ‚ÄúShe wasn‚Äôt the best mom, but looking back I can only see a woman doing the best she could with what she had. A kid she never planned for and a man-shaped hole in her heart. I wish I saw that sooner.‚Äù

Tony couldn‚Äôt help but chuckle. ‚ÄúYou know I said the same thing not 20 minutes ago.‚Äù

Monica‚Äôs eyebrows raised, ‚ÄúHow so?‚Äù

With a deep sigh Tony looked to the fading stars above and said, ‚ÄúMy mom didn‚Äôt exactly have it easy either. Raising three boys by herself while dealing with being, abandoned. It was hard on her, but she never let it spill over onto us.‚Äù He let a sad smile creep onto his face. Turning to her, he continued, ‚ÄúYou look back and see all the good your mom did, I look back and see how little I appreciated her. How, poor of a son I was. It‚Äôs ironic, in some sort of,‚Äù he waved his hand in the air, ‚Äúcosmic sense. How we only notice these things here, at the end of the road.‚Äù

Both figures stared blankly into the night, minds wrapped in the past. Bit by bit light began to shine from the east, dissipating the chill mist that had formed overnight. Dew began to sparkle under the growing radiance, coating the ground in thousands of liquid diamonds.

The dazzling display was beautiful but failed to wash away the lingering sense of regret and self-loathing within Tony‚Äôs heart. He finished the last dregs of coffee with a sigh and turned, tossing the cup away. ‚ÄúI should get back. It was good to meet you, Monica. Hope whoever you‚Äôre here for does okay.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, back at you.‚Äù She said with a wan smile, tapping the ashen remains of her cigarette onto the ground. With a nod of his head he began to step back through the door, stopping when he heard her voice call out.

‚ÄúAnd Tony?‚Äù she said, prompting him to stick his head back out the door. With the warmest smile she‚Äôd given all evening she said, ‚ÄúYour mom didn‚Äôt see it like a set of scales, she just loved you. If you want to be better, just love her back. Not to make up for anything, but because she‚Äôs your mom.‚Äù

The astuteness of her advice surprised Tony, but the truth of her words was undeniable. Returning her smile he said, ‚ÄúThanks, you‚Äôre right. She deserves it. Have a good one Monica.‚Äù

With a final nod of appreciation, Tony returned to a room now faintly lit by the coming dawn. The nurse he had talked to patted him on the shoulder as he walked by.

‚ÄúAll was quiet, but I wouldn‚Äôt leave her side again if you can help it.‚Äù She whispered, caring but firm.

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt plan to leave her until she leaves me.‚Äù Tony said, prompting a satisfied smile. With a deep breath, Tony sat himself back in his chair, the door behind him latching shut as the nurse left. His mother was exactly as he‚Äôd left her, serene and slumbering. It was as though no time had passed at all. Taking her hand he looked upon a face intimately linked in his mind with the very idea of love.

In a low, calm voice, he began to talk. He told her how much he loved her, appreciated her, respected her. He spoke of times good and bad, of current events she would never get to see. For hours he spoke, and as dawn broke golden light began to filter into the room. Weak hand held tight within his own, Tony felt the constant beat of her heart slowly dwindle as the shining light clothed her in an angel‚Äôs mantle.

Only then did he stop and cry. Not from regret or loss, but because he had told her how much he loved her. And he was certain she had heard.",1,1728921910.0,shortstories,2,1.0,False

1g3j995,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1g3j995/help_please/,"Help, please.","Hello. I'll get straight to the point, hopefully your answers can make me make a good decision cuz I am a little out of my head and probably(99%) not thinking straight. 

There is a pretty girl I met, on our first seeing in park I find out that she recently got out of some relationship and that she ain't good, and she is in chaos etc, and all that post breakup thingy. As my instinct tells to attack and try with her, flirt, I was the one who controlled myself, not allowed my passion and sex drive to lead me but I put a break. I wanted for once to be sure about me, about her and to be positive about my feelings, that it is not some idealisation or euphoria thing. After that meet, we hanged out few more times, getting to know better, she came to my place to play video games together since we both share that passion about games, and I was begining to have a big crush on her, liking her from day to day even more, BUT, she one day went on some party, kissed with some guy and now they are in relationship. Boom, hits fucking hard, no shit.

Still, story goes that we keep friendly relationship for a time beign and one day she was going to invite me to make me a dinner which was idea from the start and I was like, ""She has a boyfriend, inviting me(friend, which I wasn't anymore cuz my feelings changed but she doesn't know), to a dinner"". I just couldnt come to her place without expressing myself and feelings. Firstly because I am not of those guys who are gonna fake friendship and wait for a moment of weakness to grab it, its lame and its just not who I am so I tell her everything. 

Now things change, we talk about it, she says she has a really great guy, treating her like none before and she gives me compliments that I am awesome, that she doesn't want to lose me and that she feels so sorry that we missed the timing. I understand all, I get it, and I told her that I respect her relationship and that I won't change or do anything that can hurt that relationship and that we can be friends, I tought that for once I can chill out the situation and fight it. 

After that, one day, she sends me a message if I am free today and I come to her on her job as I did before to hangout, chit chat and grab a coffee, and when she finished her shift she invited herself to my place to play games a bit. I havent said a word about going to my place, she really invited herself and after 2h of gaming she was texting that guy amd just jumped out and said I have to go. The moment she left, I knew that all of this is wrong, that I feel bad and I knew that she does the same. A girl, with a boyfriend, coming to a guy who told her about his feelings. 

Later that night I called her, told her that I just can't be a friend, can't do this even thou I thought I could, that hanging out together is bad cuz I sincerely respect the relationship and that other guy and I will be stepping back and thatbis how all contact ended. 

Now the problem is, even thou I suspect is very wrong move, that I have a really big urge to come to her again at her work, be the cool funny guy I was, and keep it totaly friendly cuz somehow I really missed the talks and hanging out. I miss her as a person after all, miss the talks and laugh. I wish to somehow reverse situation that we are still in chill, good relationship, on ""how are you, how is it been, anything new"", but without actuall hanging out together. Few ocassional call amd that's it.

Is it true that If she really liked me from the start that she would try something or some act that I would notice that she wants me and that she wouldnt allow herself to get some random dude?

Is it true that the compliments she gave me, are just a comforting type so that I do not feel bad or she do likes me and can see me as a boyfriend but now she has one which is okay and doesn't want to break things?

Should I just surrender and let it go or should I try to fight a bit and try to keep at least some contact? I really have no clue what to do...deep inside I somehow have a feeling that she really do likes me, even as a boyfriend and that me, who was always really honest entire life, fucking deserve some chance to prove it..",1,1728921534.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

In a recent interview on September 23^(rd), 2024, at 2 p.m., Ari St. George, a real estate professional, shared insights into his career path and approach to the industry of real estate. Ari got into real estate by investing an inheritance he had received into a home at just 18 years old, which he renovated and flipped. Ari went to the University of Idaho and a small private college back east for his PhD. Ari worked in psychology for \~20 years, specializing in substance use disorders and violent offenders. Later, he transitioned from his career in psychology to being a realtor. He was drawn to being a realtor by the personal interaction, problem-solving, and creativity involved in working with clients in the real estate market. Ari emphasized that success in real estate relies not just on qualifications‚Äîsuch as obtaining a state real estate license‚Äîbut also on skills like active listening, good communication, and adaptability. He highlighted the importance of building a good relationship with clients, stating that every client relationship involves effort into finding solutions, which are often complex and specific. Ari says that creating good client relationships leads to positive word-of-mouth referrals, which are extremely important when trying to gain a client base (A. George, personal communication, September 23^(rd) 2024).

When asked about the typical workday, Ari described a routine that is structured yet also free. He starts early in the morning for personal care before starting into his busy schedule of office tasks, client meetings, and property showings. He noted that while real estate offers a degree of freedom, especially as one advances in their career, it also requires long hours, including weekends and evenings. He explains that while paperwork and negotiations are relatively straightforward and easy, interactions with clients and other real estate agents can make things difficult by adding complexities. Ari‚Äôs advice for newcomers to real estate focuses on finding a good mentor, choosing a supportive brokerage, and learning to network beyond the traditional ‚Äúsphere of influence.‚Äù He stressed the need for genuine connections with people everywhere, from the grocery store to the car wash, as key to building a successful client base. Ari advises new agents to be prepared for market fluctuations, he says that learning how to do things ‚Äúold-school‚Äù is the right way (A. George, personal communication, September 23^(rd), 2024).

**Timeline and History**

Real estate started becoming a formal career in the early 1900s. Back then, agents mainly worked as middlemen to help buy and sell land and property. The National Association of Realtors was founded in 1908, and as they grew, the profession of real estate grew as well. ‚ÄúThe National Association of Real Estate Exchanges' objective was ‚Äòto unite the real estate men of America for the purpose of effectively exerting a combined influence upon matters affecting real estate interests‚Äù (NAR, n.d.). Further on, people began to see realtors as experts who could offer advice on property values and handle their negotiations for them. Realtors started to become a necessary part of the process of buying a house. The industry of real estate has changed a lot over the years; a growing population meant more people needed homes, which made real estate a booming field. According to a survey conducted by NerdWallet, 32% plan on buying a home within 5 years (Renter, 2018). In the last 20 years, with the internet and digital listings, how agents market and sell homes has also shifted. New areas like property management and investment consulting have opened even more career paths, which is shown in figure 1. Today, real estate agents are known for building strong relationships with clients. They adapt to changing markets and keep up with rules set by groups like the National Association of Realtors. Now, more than ever, they are trusted advisors helping people make one of the biggest decisions of their lives.

**Current Event**

The National Association of REALTORS¬Æ (NAR) has recently reached a settlement to resolve claims pertaining to commissions with brokers. This agreement will end litigation involving NAR, over one million members of NAR, and several real estate associations. NAR has agreed to pay $418 million over a four-year period and implement some changes to its rules. One new change is a new MLS (multiple listing site: a network of local databases that real estate agents use to share information about properties for sale) rule prohibiting the offers of broker compensation being listed on the site, though it will still be negotiated off-MLS. This means that relators cannot pick and choose which jobs they want to take based on the compensation shown on the site. NAR will also now require any agents working with buyers to use written agreements starting in mid-July 2024 (NAR, 2024). Public perception will be impacted by this by addressing concerns about transparency in broker commissions, which many people have been frustrated with. Some see these changes as steps to protect home sellers and provide clearer options for consumers. However, others worry this could complicate transactions and limit options for buyers. For real estate professionals, this settlement could mean adapting to new rules while ensuring they maintain trust with all their clients. The changes might be seen as a positive move for improving the standards within the real estate industry, but it also shows a changing market where agents will need to adapt and conform to new regulations in order to stay on top of the market.

**Interview Reflection**

In my interview with Ari St. George, I learned a lot about the profession of real estate that will help me decide if being a realtor will suit me. One of my biggest takeaways is that being a realtor involves a lot of interpersonal work with clients, which can be very enjoyable. This aspect appeals to me because I love interacting with people. With the incorrect thought that being a realtor was mostly contracts and boring work, learning this was nice to hear. I also learned that realtors are considered self-employed, which means that they must take care of all their own benefits. However, being self-employed comes with flexibility and freedom, which further draws me to the career as I am very self-motivated and like to create my own schedule. Dr. George taught me that realtors get out of their career what they put into it; this makes me excited because I think I could put a lot into this career. This interview made the transition for me from a career that I was semi-interested in into something that I can see myself doing in the near future. While the interview made me feel confident that I could excel as a realtor, it also raised concerns about the competitive market for realtors in the Treasure Valley. The information from this interview was very informative and showed how fun being a realtor can be. This is a stark contrast to the information I gathered during research, which portrayed the career in a black-and-white filter: a boring and monotonous career of showing houses and writing contracts. Overall, my interview made me excited to continue to learn about and pursue the career of a realtor.

**Personal Reflection**

A career in real estate as a realtor would suit me due to the flexibility and interpersonal aspects of the job. My strengths in the career would come from my ability to positively interact with people; however, I may need to work with the complexities of writing contracts and adhering to standards. Working at Dutch Bros Coffee in the past has brought me a significant amount of charisma when dealing with other people, which would be very valuable as I get started in this career. I value being a good person, and I believe the real estate industry needs more of that, as many focus solely on making money without considering the people involved. The flexible hours would suit me well, as I enjoy creating my own schedule and I could work around anything that I needed to. In terms of schooling, a real estate license is relatively cheap, and being a realtor does not require a college degree. A real estate license gives agents the legal ability to represent their clients in the process of buying and selling any property (Lapp, 2022). The real estate market in the Treasure Valley is highly saturated with realtors, which could make entering the profession more challenging than I expected. This is primarily because many clients prioritize career experience when choosing a realtor to help them buy or sell a home. In terms of personal growth, I can see myself gaining significant experience in the career to become a quality realtor. I may need to jump over the hurdle of learning to find clients and writing contracts, however; I am confident that I can quickly establish myself as a capable realtor.

‚Äî‚Äî

Richard anxiously peered out through the peephole of his lead-lined door for the fifth time in the past ten minutes, and smiled in relief as he finally saw someone walking up to his apartment. They were late, but at least they actually showed. That was more than could be said of most who found out who he was. ‚Ä¶Or rather, *what* he was.

As he opened the door and looked at the journalist up close for the first time, Richard was surprised to see just how young he was. Granted, he himself was only just past 30, so he was hardly one to talk, but the kid interviewing him couldn‚Äôt be older than 18; 19 if you were being generous. Still, he didn‚Äôt comment on it; the kid was the only one who had accepted his umpteenth offer of an interview with ‚ÄúRadio Rich‚Äù and thus, he wasn‚Äôt going to look a gift horse in the mouth.

‚Ä¶God, how he *loathed* that nickname. He certainly didn‚Äôt pick it, the public just started calling him that after the incident, and spoiler alert: Said incident didn‚Äôt involve him getting into public broadcasting. 

Needless to say, this journalist kid, whoever he was, however old he was, had some moxie to be talking with one of the most dangerous men to share a small room with outside of the Rhino.

As the kid finally got his hair smoothed and papers arranged just the way he liked them, he surprised Richard again by smiling at him.

‚ÄúSorry I‚Äôm late; traffic. You know how it is‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard nodded politely, but in reality, no; he didn't really know how it was anymore. He hadn‚Äôt risked leaving his apartment in months. The risk wasn‚Äôt worth it, no matter how desperately he missed other people.

He cleared his throat, trying and failing to banish such lonely thoughts from his mind as he beckoned the journalist forward.

‚ÄúCome in, come in. Don‚Äôt worry; you‚Äôre safe from my radiation as long as neither of us pokes any holes in this suit of mine.‚Äù

The kid-journalist just chuckled as he followed Richard to his kitchen 

‚ÄúDarn, and here I was looking to get a nice tan without even having to go outside.‚Äù

This shocked Richard into laughter of his own. He liked this kid already.

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm afraid you‚Äôll have to look elsewhere.‚Äù

As the pair entered the kitchen, Richard gestured to one of a pair of chairs across from each other at the kitchen table; only one of the chairs saw any use after the incident. It was nice to see the other in use again as the kid sat down.

‚ÄúCan I get you a glass of water or anything?‚Äù

The journalist nodded.

‚ÄúPlease! I could also use a snack if you have any on offer. I worked up quite a sweat getting over here.‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs eyes widened for a moment before he averted his gaze.

‚ÄúI, uh, don‚Äôt really have much in the way of spare food at the moment. Sorry‚Ä¶‚Äù

The journalist raised an eyebrow, concern in his face.

‚ÄúMoney troubles?‚Äù

Richard didn't answer, but his expression gave it away. The journalist nodded in understanding.

‚ÄúBeen there, believe me.‚Äù

Shame crept up Richard‚Äôs back. He wished he wasn‚Äôt so, SO familiar with the expression on the journalist‚Äôs face. The concern. The pity. It was even worse than the fear and disgust on the faces of almost everyone else who laid eyes on him. 

Richard sighed. Well, now that the cat was out of the bag, he may as well know the rest.

‚Äú...‚ÄôCourse, it don‚Äôt help that while I can‚Äôt risk leaving the apartment all that much, all the grocery delivery services I‚Äôve tried blacklist me as soon as they figure out who I am. The most recent one I tried even kept the last payment for what I ordered, without delivering any of the food from the order to me‚Ä¶‚Äù

The journalist‚Äôs eyes widened in surprise, then narrowed in anger.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awful! Those scuzzbags-!‚Äù

Richard cut him off with a dismissive gesture.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a big deal. I get it, and can‚Äôt really blame them. It‚Äôs the same reason I don‚Äôt get out much. People are scared of me, and God knows they should be, what with me basically being a living cancer dispenser.‚Äù

Richard could tell the journalist didn't buy his artificial nonchalance toward the experience, but was relieved that they didn‚Äôt press the issue further as he prepared the kid‚Äôs water. Instead, they simply awkwardly cleared their throat before gesturing to the chair across from them.

‚ÄúShall we get started?‚Äù

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs.‚Äù

As Richard sat down, the journalist pulled out a beat-up laptop- one clearly at least ten years or so behind current tech- and opened up a new blank document and some audio recorder software. Richard raised an eyebrow as he saw the cracked screen alongside a few missing keys here and there. ‚ÄòMoney troubles‚Äô indeed.

The journalist typed away for a few moments before nodding to Richard.

‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you start from the beginning?‚Äù

Richard shrugged, the action causing the materials of his radiation suit to protest with a squeak of the thick fabric rubbing against itself, like that dreadful sound styrofoam makes when you do the same with it.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs as good a place to start as any, I suppose.‚Äù

He leaned back in his chair and sighed, his deadly, radioactive breath fogging the suit‚Äôs faceplate. It took him several seconds to collect his thoughts enough to begin speaking. He had been thinking about this interview for days now, anticipating every question possible in his head, all the details he‚Äôd like to add, and so on, but he was still nervous.

‚Äú‚Ä¶Falling. That‚Äôs how it felt. Like, you ever go over the first drop of a roller coaster-‚Äù

He faltered.

‚ÄúNo, I guess that‚Äôs not quite right; roller coasters are supposed to be fun, not one of the worst days of your life‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs mind raced as sweat began to bead on his brow despite the climate controlled nature of the suit. God, he was already flubbing this... Why did he think this was a good idea?

‚ÄúHm‚Ä¶ Ok, how about this: You ever go up a set of steps in the dark, and once you‚Äôve reached the top you don‚Äôt realize it so you try and take one more step up on a stair that doesn‚Äôt exist?‚Äù

The journalist nodded, so Richard continued.

‚ÄúIn that moment, when your foot falls through the empty air, you have this jolt of shock and confusion run through you with just a *lil*‚Äô spark of primal fear from your hindbrain mixed in, because the sensation makes it think you‚Äôre falling off a cliff or out of a tree or what have you.

‚ÄúBut instead of that single, inconsequential step on a staircase that never was, so inconsequential you don‚Äôt even think about it an hour later, it made me who I am now.‚Äù

He glanced down at the radiation suit, his constant companion and prison since the incident.

‚Äú‚Ä¶A freak.‚Äù

He let out a long, weary sigh, obscuring his face with the lethal green mist. He was silent for a moment, only glancing up in surprise when the journalist interjected.

‚ÄúWell, at least you‚Äôre in good company in this city, and if anything you‚Äôre the least ‚Äúfreaky‚Äù of the bunch. Sure, you might glow in the dark, but what about that Spider-Man that my boss is obsessed w- ‚Ä¶uh‚Ä¶‚Äù

The journalist trailed off as the mist of Richard‚Äôs breath dissipated from his visor, revealing the angry scowl on his face.

‚ÄúKid, I get what you‚Äôre trying to do, but just- ‚Ä¶just don‚Äôt. At least psychos like Electro or Sandman get the freedom to *choose* to hurt people. Without this suit, I hurt everyone around me whether I like it or not, and believe me: I don‚Äôt.‚Äù

The journalist winced.

‚ÄúRight. Sorry. I have a bad habit of cracking wise at the worst times. I- uh‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs just move on.‚Äù

Richard nodded in appreciation, then continued.

‚ÄúLet me set the scene: I was going for my usual walk in Central Park after work, and heard a crowd in the distance on my usual route. As I headed for the commotion, I found myself in front of a stage.

‚ÄúAs I got closer, I recognized what was going on; this type of ceremony wasn‚Äôt something I was unfamiliar with. The mayor of the big apple was shaking hands yet again with a couple of so-called ‚Äòheroes,‚Äô probably for stopping whatever threat of the week reared its ugly mug before they could burn down an orphanage, destroy the city or whatever else the lunatic in question had in mind. After all, these ‚Äòhero‚Äô pricks just *love* them some good PR-‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, to be fair they‚Äôre not *all* like that.‚Äù

Richard gave the journalist an irritated glance.

‚ÄúKid, do you want this story or not?‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, sorry. Shutting up now.‚Äù

‚Äú...As I looked up at the stage, you can think of it as though my foot had just risen up to that not-step. It hadn‚Äôt started to fall yet, but be patient; that would come soon, no matter how much I wish it never had.

‚ÄúThe heroes were jawing to the mayor about how it was their honor to serve both the masses and give justice to a world that sorely needed it, yada yada‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard made a crude, masturbatory gesture.

‚ÄúTypical PR stuff. Anyway, all I could think as I watched was that their voices sounded a bit familiar, but I couldn't place my finger on where I‚Äôd heard them before.

‚ÄúThen they started talking about the guy they busted, and if this took place indoors my eyebrows would have hit the ceiling, because the name that came out of their mouths was the guy who wrote my boss's checks‚Ä¶ Wilson Fisk.‚Äù

The journalist raised an eyebrow.

‚ÄúYou worked under the *Kingpin*? The biggest crime lord in all of New York?!‚Äù

Richard shrugged.

‚ÄúI sure as hell didn‚Äôt know that about him! I was just a security guard at one of his art galleries; y‚Äôknow, the classical Japanese paintings he collected and whatnot. To me, it was just a normal job, and Fisk was just some wealthy businessman philanthropist with a bit of a weeb streak-‚Äù

The journalist snorted.

‚ÄúHa! Weeb streak! I‚Äôll have to remember that one-‚Äù

The journalist faltered under Richard‚Äôs irritated glare.

 ‚ÄúEr, I mean- sorry. Shutting up again...‚Äù

‚ÄúWhere was I‚Ä¶ right, the stage. So as I‚Äôm reeling from *that* particular revelation, all of a sudden the two heroes unmask.

‚ÄúTo my surprise, shock, and even a little bit of awe, I found myself looking up at two faces I recognized all too well. My best friend Tyler, a man I‚Äôd known since we were in diapers together. Standing beside him was Rose, my soon-to-be-fianc√©e, or so I hoped; I had been keeping the ring in my jacket pocket for a day or two at that point, anxiously awaiting my chance to propose to her on the anniversary of when we first met.‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs expression darkened.

‚ÄúThen the foot finally fell through the empty air, because all of a sudden Rose was kissing Tyler, and everyone in the crowd but me went wild.‚Äù

Richard was silent for several moments, trying and failing to ignore the pity on the face of the kid in front of him.

‚Äú...At first I thought I was dreaming. My girlfriend being some superhero *and* cheating on me with my best friend? No. This HAD to be a dream. I pinched myself. It hurt. I did it again. It hurt. I did it a few more times, in denial, my vision blurring from the tears that sure as hell weren‚Äôt coming from the physical pain I was inflicting upon myself.

‚ÄúThe next half hour or so was a blur. I don‚Äôt remember walking away from the stage, nor do I remember walking to the nearest shoreline, but I ended up there regardless.

‚ÄúWith shaking fingers, I pulled out the box the ring was in and opened it up. I had sunk over half of my meager life savings into that damn ring, with its tiny diamond and shitty low-karat gold plating. But in that moment, I didn‚Äôt care. 

‚ÄúI stared at it for a few minutes, still crying, before I chucked it into the ocean as hard as I could. I put all my sadness and impotent rage into that throw, and when it sank beneath the water I just sat down on the pavement and silently cried for a while.

‚ÄúI barely felt the black bag slipping over my head from behind around ten minutes later, and didn‚Äôt even care all that much when I got loaded into the back of a van.

‚ÄúWhen the bag came off, I was tied to a chair in a dark room that smelled faintly of chemicals. Sitting about fifteen feet across from me were the two traitorous lovebirds, also tied to chairs. The big, scar-covered good who pulled the hood off didn‚Äôt say a word, just turned around and left me with them.‚Äù

Richard looked up at the journalist with an exhausted expression, as if reliving the scene was draining the life from him.

‚ÄúAnd when she saw me, Rose didn‚Äôt recognize me, because in reality‚Ä¶ She wasn‚Äôt really my girlfriend.‚Äù

The journalist cocked his head to the side in confusion.

‚Äú...What‚Ä¶?‚Äù

This went unanswered for several seconds before Richard let out a long sigh.

‚Äú...Y‚Äôknow how that mutant egghead guy in that fancy wheelchair who runs that weird school can mess with your head? Talk to you without speaking, look through your memories like a scrapbook, that kind of thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúTelepathy. Yeah, I‚Äôm familiar.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, after a lot of prodding and pleading on my part, ‚ÄúTyler‚Äù explained a few things. My ‚Äúgirlfriend‚Äù was looking to take down Wilson Fisk, but didn‚Äôt have any routes to do so. So she hired ‚ÄúTyler,‚Äù aka some guy with telemetry powers or whatever it was you said-‚Äù

‚ÄúTelepathy.‚Äù

‚ÄúRight, telepathy. She hired ‚ÄúTyler,‚Äù who could do that, and had him take my brain and just *play.* He tailed me to my place after work, broke in after I fell asleep, took hold of my mind and sculpted it like a damn sand castle.

‚ÄúSuddenly, this guy I didn‚Äôt know from Adam had been my best friend since childhood, and ‚ÄúRose‚Äù had been the love of my life for years. Suddenly, I had all these happy memories of me and Rose together. Romantic dates. Walks by the beach. Making a snowman in Central Park on Christmas morning like we were kids again. Laying on the couch together in silence, just enjoying each other's company. Winning her a giant bear at a carnival no matter how much she begged me to stop because the carnies rigged the game to shit and it took me $80 worth of tries but dammit I *won* her that giant teddy bear because she deserved it, because I **loved** her, and- ‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard stopped, wishing he could wipe the tears away from his eyes without risking giving this kid radiation poisoning by opening his suit to do so, wincing as it slid down his face and off the tip of his nose.

‚Äú...And none of it was real. All these feelings, these memories, all of it was stuffed inside me against my will. All so they could get close to me and have an easy way to access the gallery after hours, because though I didn‚Äôt know it at the time, it was one of Fisk‚Äôs fronts. Hell, even her *face* was fake; the police later told me they found a pair of mask prosthetics that looked just like her and ‚ÄúTyler,‚Äù so I don‚Äôt even know what this broad really looks like!‚Äù

The journalist gave Richard a few seconds to compose himself before speaking.

‚ÄúWhy would they go through all that trouble instead of just- ‚Ä¶I dunno, knocking you out in an alley and stealing your keys?‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs voice was bitter as black coffee as he answered.

‚ÄúBecause it would be more ‚Äòtragic and engaging‚Äô for Rose‚Äôs audience, whatever the hell that was supposed to mean‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?!‚Äù

Richard met the journalist's incredulous expression with a shrug.

‚ÄúYeah, I don‚Äôt get it either. Beyond the telepathy explanation, most of what they said didn‚Äôt make sense; all I was really able to glean was that she didn‚Äôt actually care about ‚Äòjustice‚Äô or ‚Äòserving the masses,‚Äô she just wanted Fisk‚Äôs money and the attention that her outing him plus the stunt on the stage would nab her. Hell, she didn‚Äôt even love the telepathy guy. The kiss was ‚Äòfor the sake of drama,‚Äô and she paid him for that too!‚Äù

The journalist‚Äôs eyes narrowed, his expression pensive.

‚Äú...Was Rose her real name?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. The telepathy dude chose Rose as the name I ‚Äòknew‚Äô her by, but she confirmed that it isn‚Äôt her real name. Granted, neither of them ever actually told me said name, but I heard the telepathy dude call her ‚ÄúSnowball‚Äù or something, figured it might be an alias.‚Äù

The journalist‚Äôs eyes widened in realization.

‚ÄúScrewball! Yeah, that sounds like her‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúWait, what?! You know her?‚Äù

The journalist shook his head.

‚ÄúI know *of* Screwball, and what I know is that her title is pretty accurate. She‚Äôs a deranged narcissist who‚Äôs waaaaay too addicted to social media for her own good, and uses crime to facilitate her need for attention- posting videos of her crimes online and the like- and infuriatingly, it actually works. Last I checked, her follower count was in the double digits of millions.‚Äù

‚Äú...Could you pull up one of her videos or something?‚Äù

With a nod and a few keys pressed, the journalist complied. As soon as he heard Screwball speak, Richard‚Äôs jaw fell open in shock.

‚ÄúI- that‚Äôs her. My God, that‚Äôs her!‚Äù

A horrifying realization dawned on him.

‚Äú...You‚Äôre saying I had my mind rearranged and got turned into a radiation-tainted freak of nature because some attention-hungry bimbo wanted a few more clicks on social media‚Ä¶?‚Äù

The journalist opened his mouth, but paused and closed it, unable to meet his gaze. That was all the answer Richard needed. 

His shoulders slumped, and he was silent for almost a full minute, quietly reeling at this revelation, staring into the distance at nothing in particular. The journalist shifted uncomfortably in his seat.

‚ÄúListen, if you need some time to process this or whatever, I can always just come back-‚Äù

‚ÄúNo!‚Äù

Richard leapt from his chair, almost sending it falling over backwards with the force of his ascent. He shook his head with a manic gleam in his eye, fearful that if the journalist walked out the door he‚Äôd never return, like everyone always did.

‚ÄúNo, nonono, please stay! I can go on!‚Äù

The journalist lifted his hands up in a placating gesture, his eyes widening with concern.

‚ÄúOk, ok! I just don‚Äôt want you to feel obligated or anything-‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than alright! I can talk about this, I *can,* no matter h-how pointless and c-cruel it was, and- ‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard shook his head again, not even noticing the tears trickling down his cheeks as he forced a smile that was more grimace than anything else.

‚Äú...Let‚Äôs just move on to when I ended up like this. Alright?‚Äù

The journalist hesitantly nodded, and Richard relaxed, sitting back down.

‚ÄúRight. Ok. Good‚Ä¶‚Äù

He cleared his throat, trying to calm his nerves. He had tried not to think of the moments he was about to describe for months now. Suppressed the memories, buried them dark and deep in his mind where they couldn't hurt him. After all, they couldn't hurt him if he didn‚Äôt think about it, right?

‚Ä¶Right‚Ä¶?

‚ÄúSo, when the two eventually stopped talking- or rather, bickering about whose fault this was, with the bimbo occasionally whinging about how they missed the opportunity to get my breakdown on camera- a screen on the wall suddenly lit up the darkness of the room, and I heard a voice I‚Äôd only ever heard on TV and radio: Fisk.

‚ÄúHe gave the three of us a furious glare from the screen, but he explained that he was more disappointed than angry. Told us that he had been hoping for a better motive than mere notoriety from the guilty party. 

‚ÄúYou should have seen the look on ‚ÄúRose‚Äôs‚Äù face when Fisk informed her that he had found her hideout and had his goons destroy all her equipment; it was like she had been informed her kid had died or something.

‚ÄúAs she was reeling from that, I was finally able to string together a few words. I asked him if I was free to go, since they had just confessed to everything, including my innocence in the deal.

‚ÄúHe just shook his head. Told me that he doesn't tolerate failure, and that I would be ‚Äòmade an example of,‚Äô just like the other two.‚Äù

The journalist sighed.

‚ÄúYeah, that sounds like Willie‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard shrugged.

‚ÄúCertainly not the one I knew of. But just like the other two, regardless of who I *thought* he was, he showed his true colors.

‚ÄúSuddenly, this panel slid open in the floor underneath us, and I looked down to see we were on a suspended platform above a pool of steaming gunk. Then- ‚Ä¶Jesus Mary and Joseph, the **fumes**...‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs nostrils flared as he sneered in disgust at the memory.

‚ÄúMy nose began to burn, and the three of us immediately started coughing. It felt like I had a gallon or so of sweat in each eye, and my sinuses were on fire. I barely heard Fisk explaining that this stuff was a mix of toxic and radioactive waste, shit he apparently discreetly dumped for the Roxxon corporation as some sort of deal they‚Äôd had or something so Roxxon could keep its ‚Äòclean and green‚Äô reputation going.‚Äù

The journalist paused in his typing.

‚Äú...Do you want me to include that in the interview, or exclude it? It might land you in hot water with Roxxon.‚Äù

Richard just gave a mirthless chuckle.

‚ÄúKid, I‚Äôve already taken a dip in Roxxon‚Äôs ‚Äòhot waters.‚Äô I could care less what their lawyers think of me.‚Äù

‚ÄúFair enough.‚Äù

‚Äú...Anyway, the platform we‚Äôre on starts lowering. Fisk has the biggest, suggest smile on as he jaws about how we‚Äôll get dumped with the rest of it in the woods somewhere in the sticks, never to be found. Then, Rose-‚Äù

Richard faltered before continuing, avoiding the journalist‚Äôs gaze.

‚Äú...Rather, that Snowball chick-‚Äù

‚ÄúScrewball.‚Äù

One of Richard‚Äôs eyes twitched.

‚ÄúWhatever she called herself! She starts freaking out, begging for her life, bargaining; she said she‚Äôd use her follower base to promote Fisk‚Äôs enterprises. ‚ÄòJust think of the exposure!‚Äô‚Äù

The journalist snorted at this last line, but motioned for Richard to continue.

‚ÄúMe, I‚Äôm just sitting there, silent. I‚Äôm not a very proud man, but I wasn‚Äôt going to give Fisk and R- ‚Ä¶and the chick next to me the satisfaction of watching me beg.‚Äù

Richard let out a long, weary sigh, and was silent for a solid 20 seconds or so. Just when the journalist was going to ask him another question, he broke the silence.

‚ÄúIn those moments, what I thought were the last before I‚Äôd be choking to death on shit no human should touch, much less be submerged in, I- ‚Ä¶I closed my eyes and retreated into those memories of me and Rose. I knew- and still know- that they were tainted. Fake. Put there without my consent. Yet, they were still the happiest ‚Äúmemories‚Äù I had in this brain of mine.‚Äù

Richard felt shame creeping up his back as he admitted this moment of weakness to the kid, and by extension the world at large. For a moment he was tempted to ask the journalist not to include it, but he pushed the thought away. This was his story, and he was going to share it with a world that shunned him, warts and all.

‚ÄúAnd then, as I was hiding behind this illusion of happiness, I was jolted out of it by this loud crashing noise, and looked around. One of the guards had been chucked into the screen of Fisk‚Äôs smug face, which had since turned pissed again, his angry fat face made all the uglier by the broken glass distorting his features. I look up and see this guy in a red and blue onesie decking the rest of Fisk‚Äôs goons left and right.‚Äù

Richard nodded to the journalist.

‚ÄúIt was that dude you mentioned before, the spider-guy.‚Äù

‚ÄúSpider-Man.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, that guy. He was busting heads, webbing guys to the floor, the wall, the ceiling. I‚Äôd never seen someone move so fast before...

‚ÄúFisk shouted something, I couldn't quite catch it over all the chaos and gunfire, but I could hazard a guess as to what the gist of it was when the platform we were on lurched and started speeding up on its descent. We were several feet above the sludge before the action started, but within a second or two we were mere inches above it. I could practically taste the stuff at that point, and couldn't keep my eyes open any longer from the fumes.

‚ÄúJust before I closed my eyes, I saw the guy in the costume leap toward us. I felt the slightest twinge of hope in that moment; ‚Äòmaybe I‚Äôll get out of this in one piece,‚Äô I thought to myself. But just before my eyes closed, I saw the angle that he had jumped at, and my heart may as well have plummeted into my stomach, because he was aiming for the head-fuckery guy and the psycho who wanted to use my mental breakdown as clickbait.‚Äù

Richard‚Äôs voice began to quiver a little.

‚Äú...I guess it‚Äôs like the trolley problem, y‚Äôknow? Without any context on these people tied to the tracks- the lives they've led, the choices they‚Äôve made, and so on- do you want to save one life or two?‚Äù

Richard looked down at his hands, concealed beneath his radiation suit.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs nice when it‚Äôs just a concept. Some hypothetical idea you can discuss with your pals over a beer or three when the booze has you feeling all philosophical. ‚ÄòThe good of the many vs the few‚Äô and all that.‚Äù

He looked up at the journalist, who was looking more and more uncomfortable.

‚Äú...But when *you‚Äôre* among those designated as ‚Äòthe few,‚Äô the guy strapped to the tracks all on your lonesome, and you see the guy manning the lever pull it so the trolley is heading toward you? Knowing that the other two are the reason you‚Äôre all strapped on the tracks to b-begin with, and will probably go on to h-hurt more people just like y-you-‚Äù

Richard took a deep breath, trying unsuccessfully to quell the ongoing violent maelstrom of his thoughts.

‚Äú...Well, what matters is that he didn‚Äôt pick me, and I got dunked.‚Äù

Richard shuddered at the memory.

‚ÄúWhen I went under, it felt like I‚Äôd simultaneously been plunged into boiling water and an icy stream in December. Hot and cold, all over my body, and my nerve endings reacted appropriately by helpfully informing me that every cell of my body was on fire. Or at least, that‚Äôs the only thing I can really compare the pain to.

‚ÄúThe last thing I felt was something clinging to my back and a tugging sensation, like I was being lifted by something- the spider-dude‚Äôs webs, probably- and then I finally, mercifully blacked out from the shock.

‚ÄúNext thing I knew, it was two days later and I was in a hospital bed, delighted to find I was bone-dry, not a lick of that gunk still on me. I was surrounded on all sides by thick curtains I later learned were lead, and they were walking out one of my previous nurses; dude looked sunburned from head to toe. The rest of the docs were in these weird-looking suits; the kind I‚Äôm wearing now.‚Äù

Despite everything, Richard‚Äôs face managed to summon an amused smirk at the memory.

‚ÄúI was high as a kite on morphine at the time, and giggled- literally *giggled*, like ‚Äòheeheehee‚Äô- as I asked the docs why they were all dressed up in their Sunday best like this if all the dangerous, toxic, radioactive stuff had been scrubbed off me by that point?‚Äù

His smile faded as quickly as it came.

‚ÄúThey waited for me to sober up to tell me about my genes getting screwed up by the radiation and chemicals in juuuust the right way, like kids who get born with that mutant X-gene or what have you. But instead of being able to fly or breathe underwater or something, I got- well, this. ‚Ä¶It wasn‚Äôt a fun conversation.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can imagine. ‚Ä¶So, was the nurse ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, he was fine. I asked the doc the same thing as soon as I realized it was me that hurt him, but it really was just the equivalent of a bad sunburn. Some aloe vera, and he was right as rain.‚Äù

Richard let out a weary sigh.

‚Äú...But of course, that‚Äôs when it started. I dunno if dunking me in that goop like a cookie into milk suped up my ears too, the docs and patients in that joint were just louder than they think they are, or they just didn‚Äôt care if I heard. All I know is that I heard a lot more whispered conversations than I should have.

‚Äú‚ÄòI hear that ‚ÄòRadio Rich‚Äô guy in the room over there killed a nurse!‚Äô ‚ÄòMy brother thinks he‚Äôs another super-psycho in the making.‚Äô ‚ÄòDid you hear? That radioactive dude worked for Fisk!‚Äô ‚ÄòHey, why did you put us in a room next to that radioactive guy? I don‚Äôt want to wake up with my skin sloughing off!‚Äô‚Äù

Richard let out an irritated huff.

‚Äú...I try not to be bitter. I really, truly do. But people keep calling me ‚ÄúRadio Rich‚Äù like I‚Äôm one of those psychos they have locked up in Rykers or the Raft when I‚Äôm just some guy, some normal guy who got played a bad hand, and I‚Äôm almost out of savings because no one wants to hire a guy who makes your hair fall out no matter that so long as the suit is intact I‚Äôm safe to be around, and I can‚Äôt work from home because I can‚Äôt type or use a touchscreen in these big-ass gloves but if I take the suit off the rads will fry any electronics more complex than a landline phone if I use them for more than a day or two, and I can‚Äôt reliably get food because if I go out and the suit tears somehow everyone around me is in danger, and everyone is afraid of me with or without it- hell, you‚Äôre the first person to so much as talk to me face-to-face in *months*-!!!‚Äù

Richard didn‚Äôt notice that he had started hyperventilating; if he *had* noticed, at this point he wouldn't have cared. The bottle he had been keeping all this in had finally cracked, and its contents were determined to be released.

He got up and started pacing, gesticulating more and more wildly.

‚Äú-and the lead curtains block out all the sunlight so it feels like I‚Äôm living in a goddamn solitary confinement cell, a-and this suit feels like a goddamn c-cage, and I can‚Äôt even get so much as a cat or dog or even a damn *goldfish* to keep me company unless I want to live in this suit 24/7 because without it I‚Äôd just k-kill them slowly, and I‚Äôll probably never be able to f-feel the t-touch of another human ever, ever, EVER FUCKING AGAIN, WHILE FUCKING ROSE AND FUCKING TYLER GET TO FUCKING WALK AROUND **SCOT-FUCKING-FREE, AND**- ‚Ä¶a-and‚Ä¶‚Äù

Richard tried and failed to stifle a sob.

‚Äú.........I r-really, *really* t-try not to be b-bitter‚Ä¶‚Äù

 Richard silently stood there for a moment, tears streaming down his face to his endless embarrassment as he took several deep breaths, desperately trying to keep himself from breaking down completely. When he finally regained a semblance of self-control, Richard slowly made his way back to his seat and sat down, his gaze glued to the floor.

When he eventually gathered the fortitude to look back up at the journalist, ready to continue, he was surprised to see that it looked as though the journalist was just as close to tears as Richard was at that moment. His eyes widened in concern.

‚Äú...You ok, kid?‚Äù

The journalist cleared his throat, suddenly unable to meet Richard‚Äôs gaze.

‚ÄúYeah, f-fine. Yup...‚Äù

Richard hesitantly nodded, but his concern remained as he saw the kid surreptitiously wipe a stray tear away. He hoped he hadn‚Äôt traumatized the kid by unloading all this on him‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWell, if you say so. Anyway, you can, uh- ‚Ä¶scrape anything useful from that whole tirade of mine just there, I guess‚Ä¶?‚Äù

Richard shifted in his seat, still embarrassed, but cleared his throat and squared his shoulders. If nothing else, he would end this shitshow on a good note.

‚Äú...Me bitching about my struggles aside, if there‚Äôs one thing that gets in this news piece, I want this next part to be it. Ok?‚Äù

The journalist nodded, so Richard went on.

‚ÄúGood. Here goes: That spider guy, Spider-Man or whatever it is he calls himself? He did nothing wrong.‚Äù

The journalist paused, looking up from his computer with astonishment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶?‚Äù

‚ÄúI said what I said. Your boss, that Jonah guy you mentioned earlier? I‚Äôve read his work, and you‚Äôre right, the guy has a real hard-on for talking smack about that spider-dude. But even though I didn‚Äôt draw the short stick so much as a wad of sawdust, Spider-Man had to make a choice in a matter of milliseconds with no context. Even I can‚Äôt fault him for knowing that two is greater than one, y‚Äôknow?‚Äù

The journalist took several seconds to respond, and their voice was shaky when they did.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs- ‚Ä¶v-very understanding of you.‚Äù

Richard shrugged.

‚ÄúWhat can I say? I‚Äôve had a lot of time stuck in this apartment to ponder my situation.‚Äù

Despite Richard‚Äôs dour mood, he managed to summon a wry smile.

‚Äú...Plus, y‚Äôknow, saving my life instead of leaving me to drown choking down uber-toxic chemicals tends to earn you some brownie points in my book.‚Äù

The journalist gave a weak chuckle.

‚ÄúI suppose so.‚Äù

There was a brief silence broken by an awkward cough from Richard.

‚Äú...Listen, I think I might take you up on your offer of leaving it at that for the day after all. That lil‚Äô outburst of mine- I apologize for that, by the way, it probably wasn‚Äôt useful to you- it‚Äôs left me feeling a bit drained.‚Äù

To Richard‚Äôs surprise, the journalist extended his hand to shake.

‚ÄúNot a problem! Not at all. Call me if you remember anything else you‚Äôd like to include in the article.‚Äù

Richard gingerly reached forward and took the kid‚Äôs hand, awkwardly shaking it with an equally awkward forced smile.

‚ÄúWill do. Here‚Äôs hoping it can change some people‚Äôs minds about me; lord knows I need all the help I can get on that front.‚Äù

The kid chuckled nervously as he released his hand.

‚ÄúI‚Äôll do my best, but I‚Äôll admit I‚Äôm kinda new to this; this is actually my first journalistic interview.‚Äù

‚ÄúReally now?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm usually a photographer, but your offer for an interview interested me so I thought I‚Äôd branch out a bit.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do fine, Mr.-‚Äù

Richard paused.

‚ÄúGod, I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôm horrible with names‚Ä¶. What did you say yours was again?‚Äù

‚ÄúNot a problem! I‚Äôm Peter. Peter Parker.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell then, I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll do fine, Mr. Parker.‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî

As Peter left the apartment building, he pulled out his aging phone with its almost-unusably-cracked screen and made a call, anxiously pacing as he waited. He breathed a sigh of relief when he heard the dial tone end as the call was answered.

‚ÄúHey Peter, what‚Äôs up?‚Äù

‚ÄúHey Doctor Banner! So I, uh- ‚Ä¶jeez, this is gonna sound real weird without context, but bear with me. Quick question: You‚Äôre immune to harm from radiation, right?‚Äù

There was a brief pause from the other end of the line before Bruce Banner responded in a bemused tone.

‚ÄúUhhhhh‚Ä¶ yup, you‚Äôre right, this *does* sound pretty weird, but yeah, I am. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. Listen, I really, *really* need a favor-‚Äù

‚ÄúI- wh- ‚Ä¶what favor could possibly involve me being immune to radiation-?!‚Äù

‚ÄúTrust me, it‚Äôs relevant. Question two: Do you have any job openings in your lab? Security guard, janitor, something like that?‚Äù

‚Äú...Peter, where the hell is this going‚Ä¶?

Peter pulled out his laptop and frantically began typing.

‚ÄúI‚Äôm gonna send you the audio of an interview I just performed with someone, alright? Please just listen to it and then get back to me.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, ok, fine‚Ä¶‚Äù

Twenty minutes passed after Peter sent the data before his phone started ringing again. He picked up on the first ring.

‚ÄúHi again, doc. ‚Ä¶So?‚Äù

There was a long sigh from the other end of the line.

‚Äú...I‚Äôll see what I can do. I prefer to work with as few people as possible for reasons that I hope should be pretty damn obvious, but given the guy‚Äôs situation, I can make an exception. ‚Ä¶Hell, I just hope he‚Äôs alright working around someone as dangerous as *me,* not the other way around.‚Äù

A relieved smile spread across Peter‚Äôs face.

‚ÄúThanks, doc. Really. I owe you one.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo prob. After all, us ‚Äòradiation-tainted freaks of nature‚Äô have to look out for one another, right?‚Äù

Peter couldn't help but laugh, glancing down at the spot on his hand where a certain radioactive spider had bitten him so long ago.

‚ÄúYeah, I suppose we do.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou‚Äôve got a good heart, Peter. Don't beat yourself up over this, alright? Even he doesn't blame you.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, yeah, I‚Äôm not. Don't worry.‚Äù

There was a brief pause before Peter heard a sad chuckle from the other end of the phone.

‚Äú...You‚Äôre an awful liar, you know that?‚Äù

Peter sighed.

‚Äú...Yeah. I know‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, I think I‚Äôm going to call in my favor now, because it just may help you feel a bit better: Catch that Screwball punk, alright? Charles or Logan can probably help you find the mutant she hired. It‚Äôs not much, but it‚Äôs a possible lead.‚Äù

Peter cautiously glanced around for any potential witnesses or security cameras before he walked into a nearby deserted alleyway and began to change.

‚ÄúWay ahead of you. I was planning on swinging by the ol‚Äô School for Youngsters anyway to ask Mr. Xavier if he'd be willing to extend an offer to extricate those fake memories from Richard.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood thinking, no pun intended. ‚Ä¶And Peter?‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah?‚Äù

‚ÄúSeriously. *This wasn‚Äôt your fault.*‚Äù

Peter was silent for several moments before sighing and hanging up, not trusting himself to answer.

‚Äú...No, I suppose it‚Äôs not,‚Äù he muttered to the empty alleyway, pulling out his mask and staring at it for a few moments before slipping it on. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs Fisk‚Äôs. It‚Äôs the telepath‚Äôs. It‚Äôs Screwball‚Äôs.‚Äù

And as he adjusted it just so and prepared to swing away, he let slip six more words:

‚Äú...But fixing this *is* my responsibility.‚Äù

There's this recent trend I've observed especially with online female lifestyle coaches about being feminine that just screams repackaged misogyny to me. 

I came across this video (which I won't name citing sub rules) where this lifestyle coach with a considerable number of followers was saying absolute bs to YOUNG IMPRESSIONABLE girls. It was about being feminine and all the things she listed were literally run off the mill misogynistic standards that men have perpetuated for ages. 

First of all why is caring considered feminine, it serves a wrong impression to boys and just perpetuates toxic masculinity. 

Constantly wearing dresses, smelling like roses and vanilla in every part of my body, not having bodily hair (which is natural), not being ambitious because ambition is apparently a masculine trait or being submissive/ willing to let go of control are just what ""ideal woman"" would look like back in the 90s (even today), just so men can gain control and keep us in check. Like I never knew having ambition, wanting to be in charge and planning out things was a man's job in fucking 2024??? 

The thing that really pisses me off with these ""dating coaches"" is them saying to be a ""High value woman"" you should be not agreeing to coffee dates or netflix and chill and anything below a 5 star dinner date automatically diminishes your value as a woman because apparently ""we are the prize"" ladies, not human beings capable of having fun and being loved. 

This is such toxic advice to young women, who'd spend ages believing they're not worthy enough if they don't dress/ smell/ behave a certain way. And let's not get started about how cooking is a feminine trait while taking out trash is a masculine (blue) trait (yea some people actually used that word pink and blue chores). 

Going on coffee dates to get to know that person without wasting too much time/ money, and netflix dates or going on walks are perfectly reasonable traits and don't diminish your value as a woman. Your value is actually shown in your core values and how empathetic, driven, confident you are, if anyone is reading this. 

If anything, being in your chill, authentic element after a few dates, actually helps you know that person better rather than performing this act of enforced femininity. You'll get to know how people are in different situations and how they behave/ react in different settings (say an escape room) which is very essential in determining your overall compatibility. 

This repackaged misogyny being served as girlboss feminism or high value woman-ism or dateable-ism NEEDS TO STOP. 

Your values, the way you behave, act, your confidence, your impact on people, your hobbies is what determines your true self.

1g3j3lz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MorbidlyObese/comments/1g3j3lz/good_morning/,Good morning!,"Good morning, lovely people!  I know you're out there, because every time I visit this sub, there are 3-5 other people online. This is me last year, before I lost 65 lb. I'm not much smaller, now. At that time, I was spending all day, every day, sat in that chair under a blanket with my feet up, playing games on my phone. Hubby cooked and served my meals. He ran out for treats if I wanted them. 

He simply loves me and wants me to be happy. I was actually happy in this picture. My games, blanket, recliner, and home were a safe place. They still are. 

I am not proud of how I look in this picture. While I'm sat there, playing mobile games and streaming shows on television, I don't have to look at myself. I just experience the immersion and freedom from uncomfortable thoughts and emotions.  This is the easier, softer, way. Ease into that chair. Reach for the device. Drink that coffee. The worst thing that could happen was the remote sliding off the arm of the chair. If it skittered under the chair, I was in trouble.

I can still get down onto the floor, but it hurts because the fat on my shins hurts from the weight on them, so I can't kneel and bend down, I have to actually lay all the way down on my stomach or side before I reach under the chair.  

We all have last straws. It's not important what it was (mine happens to be that dog). The straw is us at our core, the thing we care about that that nudges us to get healthy.  The thing that gives us courage to do what needs to be done: brush aside the shame and reach for help. 

I intentionally face shame when I see a photo of myself, when I step on the scale, when I get dressed (or undressed), and when I go outdoors, to the store, to a restaurant. 

""Almost anybody can learn to think or believe or know, but not a single human being can be taught to feel. Why? Because whenever you think or you believe or you know, you're a lot of other people: but the moment you feel, you're nobody-but-yourself.

To be nobody-but-yourself -- in a world which is doing its best, night and day, to make you everybody else -- means to fight the hardest battle which any human being can fight; and never stop fighting."" \~ e. e. cummings

Right now, I'm fighting every day to stop being compulsive about things. Stop compulsive eating. Stop compulsive gaming. Stop compulsive TV watching. Stop compulsive internet use. This sub is one of my tools. Thank you for being here.

She often opens her front door whenever she sees my car pull up infront of the apartment building and chats with me for a bit.

It's usually about what her children / grandchildren are up to and admittedly, most of it she has already told me many times over . But I don't mind that one bit. 

She invites me over for cups of coffee , brings me snacks and even often overs me help whenever I am working on my apartment (which I always gladly decline) , among many other things and I help her whenever I can in return.

I gave her my mobile number in case of emergencies, now she calls me on a regular basis, just to talk, almost as if I was one of her own children. 

Sadly it seems like she has some form of early alzheimers as she calls me by one of her sons names at times but I don't mind that aswell.

I am just genuinely glad to have her as my neighbor. She's also alone most of the time and rarely has any company around. It's sad really, I can only imagine how it must feel be an elderly widow or widower.

I drank from it and the water tasted like plastic. Ok, try a different water brand. Still plastic. At some point I drank enough of it and it gave me a migraine, and my husband told me I looked drunk and I should take it easy. I stopped drinking out of it and devoured greasy food until I felt better.

We went through the Avalon manual's cleaning process and at first it seemed like the water tasted normal. But after sitting in the cooler for a day, it was back to tasting like plastic. We're past the return period, so this is his office water cooler now. Idk why, but he can't taste the plastic taste like I can. 

I'm so sick of random liquid sources hurting me. Buccee's black coffee. Every Brita filter ever. Reverse osmosis water when the carbon filter expires months before it's supposed to? Berkey filters. Probably fridge filters too. My mom's coffee maker when she fills it with filtered water (one of my worst single day migraines).

So yeah, I'm drinking 1 gallon jugs of alkaline water now. The nasty tap water doesn't technically give me migraines, but I really don't feel like finding out what other long term effects it has on my health. If anyone else has the same stupid water problems, please tell me so I don't feel like the only crazy water-fearing migraine sufferer.

This isn't about his WWE triumphs or Hollywood blockbusters. Instead, it's about the foundational lessons he learned in his formative years - many in gritty gyms and through life's toughest moments. Here are 10 mindset techniques that The Rock employs to stay grounded, motivated, and continually successful.

[Photo: Eva Rinaldi via Wikimedia Commons](https://preview.redd.it/502esozitqud1.jpg?width=1000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=434b4666a39d1362f0074b7cbe2d99b369f71486)

# 1. Embrace the Grind¬†

For Johnson, hard work isn't just an action - it's a way of life. Inspired by his father, who was up at 5 a.m. every morning to hit the gym, Dwayne learned early on that dedication is non-negotiable. ""Every morning my dad was up at 5 a.m. He‚Äôd have his coffee and then hit the gym, regardless of whether he was at home or on the road,"" [he recalls](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/dwayne-rock-johnsons-7-life-lessons/).¬†

Instead of playgrounds, his father took him to ""very hardcore"" gyms. This unique upbringing taught him that there's [no substitute for effort](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/dwayne-rock-johnsons-7-life-lessons/). ""Other dads took their kids to the playground. Mine took me to the gym... it was there that I learned at a very young age that there‚Äôs no substitute for hard work.""

# 2. Define Your Purpose¬†

Understanding the 'why' behind actions fuels motivation. Johnson observed that successful individuals achieved greatness through ""sweat equity - putting callouses on their hands."" Recognizing this, he decided to emulate their path. ""I‚Äôd continue going to the gym and work harder than before,"" [he said](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/dwayne-rock-johnsons-7-life-lessons/), seeing it as the key to his own success.

# 3. Shift from 'Have To' to 'Get To'

A simple change in perspective significantly influenced Johnson's approach to life. ""Years ago, I stopped saying 'I have to' and started saying 'I get to',"" [he shared](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a38863790/dwayne-johnson-shares-the-philosophy-thats-the-key-to-his-success/) on Instagram.

This ""big psychological shift"" helps him tackle daily tasks with gratitude and positivity. [He advises](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/fitness/a38863790/dwayne-johnson-shares-the-philosophy-thats-the-key-to-his-success/) others to adopt this mindset to ""feel that grind, gratitude & growth.""

# 4. Your Past Shapes Your Future

Johnson doesn't shy away from his past; instead, he uses it as a catalyst for growth. ""I always want to remind people of my past because it is directly responsible for who I am today,"" [he says](https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/dwayne-rock-johnsons-7-life-lessons/). ""You can strip them all away... The one thing that‚Äôs absolutely guaranteed is that I will still be training when the sun comes up.""¬†

# 5. Find Your Daily Anchor

Consistency is crucial for Johnson, who [emphasizes the importance of establishing a daily routine](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19911094/the-rock-dwayne-johnson-travel-workout-motivation/) to ground himself. ""I always talk about the importance of 'anchoring' our day,"" Johnson shared. ""Wherever I land, regardless of what time it is - I‚Äôll get to the hotel, shower, eat, meditate, shot of caffeine and hit the gym. That way I‚Äôve anchored my day and now I‚Äôm ready \[to\] work my press tour.""¬†

By anchoring his day with these practices, he ensures he's mentally and physically prepared for whatever comes next. This routine isn't just about physical fitness; it's about creating a sense of stability and control in an otherwise hectic schedule. It reinforces his commitment to discipline and sets a positive tone for the rest of his day.

# 6. Pursue Continuous Growth

Johnson firmly believes that success is not an overnight phenomenon but the result of consistent effort over time. ""Success isn‚Äôt overnight. It‚Äôs when every day you get a little better than before. It adds up,"" [he emphasizes](https://lovelyimpact.com/business-motivation-quotes/).¬†

This mindset keeps him focused on incremental improvements rather than immediate results. By aiming to be better each day, no matter how small the progress, he ensures long-term growth and development. It's about building momentum through daily victories that compound over time.

# 7. Turn Setbacks into Comebacks

After being cut from the Canadian Football League, Johnson faced a significant setback. But instead of letting it defeat him, he reframed the experience. ""Sometimes the goal we‚Äôve worked... for years is never achieved. Then years later we look back and realize, it‚Äôs the best thing that NEVER happened,"" [he reflects](https://www.instagram.com/p/BXmRHTVl5er).¬†

This perspective allowed him to pivot from a failed football career to becoming a professional wrestler and eventually a Hollywood superstar. He encourages others to have faith during tough times, believing that setbacks can lead to even greater opportunities.¬†

# 8. Harness Obstacles as Fuel

When faced with adversity, Johnson's instinct is to take action. After his football dreams were shattered, he didn't succumb to despair indefinitely. ""I started training again,"" [he said](https://www.inc.com/carmine-gallo/what-the-rocks-7-buck-moment-teaches-us-about-the-.html). ""Sometimes you're going to get your a\*\* kicked. You've got to get up and have faith.""

By channeling his energy into productive activities, he combats negativity and builds momentum toward his next goal. This proactive approach is a powerful tool for overcoming obstacles and maintaining a positive outlook.

# 9. Embrace Hope

At 23 years old, after his football career abruptly ended, Dwayne Johnson found himself back in his parents' small apartment, battling deep depression. Feeling humiliated and lost, he spent [days cleaning the walls](https://www.readtheprofile.com/p/dwayne-the-rock-johnson) because it was the only thing he felt he could control. ""At 23, you think life is over,"" he recalls.

Johnson realized that depression makes you feel isolated, as if you're alone in your darkness. However, he emphasizes the importance of holding onto hope. ""Just got to remember to hold on to that fundamental quality of faith. Have faith. On the other side of your pain is something good,"" [he encourages](https://www.readtheprofile.com/p/dwayne-the-rock-johnson). By embracing the belief that tomorrow is a new day filled with possibilities, he was able to turn his life around. His experience illustrates that even in our lowest moments, maintaining hope can lead us toward a brighter future.

# 10. Compete with Yourself

Dwayne Johnson believes that the [greatest competition comes from within](https://www.menshealth.com/fitness/a19911094/the-rock-dwayne-johnson-travel-workout-motivation/). ""Your hardest competition out there is always gonna be you,"" he asserts. ""And the funny thing is, after years and years of hard work when you become masterful at your craft - you‚Äôll make it look easy. And the irony about that misconception is it‚Äôs the hardest work you‚Äôll ever put in.""

By focusing on self-improvement and personal mastery, Johnson emphasizes that the journey toward excellence is continuous. This mindset shifts the focus from external competitors to internal challenges. By relentlessly pushing his own limits, he ensures constant growth and avoids complacency. Competing with oneself creates a powerful drive to achieve more, highlighting that the path to mastery involves making the hardest work appear effortless.

He has mentioned to me that he wants to work already but suddenly when he got a small amount from the auto sales, he held off on the job and continued to work still with auto sales.

When I sleep on his house, I end up paying for dinner and then for breakfast, sometimes lunch as well. Whenever we are not together, he doesn't eat much. He just eats biscuits.

Lately, we are though planning to lose weight so I'll have a reason for us to eat lesser and just eat oatmeal and not have much food to eat.

1g3itnu,https://www.reddit.com/r/lexapro/comments/1g3itnu/my_lexapro_story/,My Lexapro story,"I started taking Lexapro at 20 after I developed debilitating anxiety. That with a mix of clonazepam PRN saved me. At 26 I decided I was good enough to ween off. I did (cold turkey) and surprisingly was okay. I think it was because summer was coming up it was nice outside and I was keeping my mind mentally active.

Fast forward to may of this year. I‚Äôm cold turkey off of all medication, making over 100k job wise and feeling great. My boyfriend and I are traveling and just living the absolute life. Then I get a text. 

A man my friend introduced to our group that I felt a weird feeling about was on a multistate stabbing spree. He wasn‚Äôt caught by police yet but a BOLO was out. I felt immense anxiety right away and thought I was going to pass out. I only was around him a few times but I felt he wasn‚Äôt who he said he was. The last time I talked to him was New Year‚Äôs Day- he called and said he wanted to pick me up and bring me to meet up with my friends. It didn‚Äôt make sense because I was wary of him. I later found out they never met up with him that day. 

I began seeing him in my dreams, that were now nightmares. I was terrified to leave the house and kept hearing his voice. I had flashbacks of him and tried to piece together what was real and what wasn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs weird but like I said I was only around him a few times so why was he living in my head. I pride myself in feeling people‚Äôs energy but for some reason I missed a huge dark part of his.

As summer went on my anxiety was at an all time high. I didn‚Äôt really want to go out of the house, or honestly do anything. I felt so stuck and so trapped. I worked so hard to get out of this feeling. My boyfriend and I went on a couple weekend trips and I felt like I was going to pass out because my anxiety was so bad. Then at the end of August we broke up and I feel everything spiraled out of control. I was laid off from my job, lost my boyfriend and felt like I had nothing left. I‚Äôm not going to say I was questioning hurting myself but it was a really dark feeling. At that time I decided to go back on Lexapro.

It‚Äôs been about 3.5 weeks and I‚Äôm starting to feel a lot better. I do wish I had clonazepam or something to take but I‚Äôm making it through. I can finally go into a coffee shop and sleep throughout the night without feeling an impending doom.I will say I did not miss the night sweats but I‚Äôll take them anyway over how I felt before.

Lexapro truly is a life changing medication and I understand being wary of taking it or feeling like your lesser than but in reality it makes you better than! You can function and you feel great in time.

Onwards and upwards. Thank you for being here and listening to me.  ",2,1728920456.0,lexapro,0,1.0,False

1g3iqge,https://www.reddit.com/r/howtoworkonlinenow/comments/1g3iqge/how_to_get_into_advertising_work_without/,How to Get Into Advertising Work Without Experience,"Entering the **advertising industry** without prior experience might seem daunting, but with the right approach, it's entirely possible. The world of advertising is constantly evolving, and many agencies and companies are on the lookout for fresh talent with a creative mindset, a knack for storytelling, and the ability to adapt quickly. While traditional qualifications can help, they're not always essential. In this guide, we‚Äôll walk you through actionable strategies to break into advertising without formal experience and set yourself up for success in a highly competitive industry.

# 1. Build a Portfolio of Personal Projects

One of the quickest ways to demonstrate your abilities to potential employers is by creating a **portfolio**. This is especially important when you don‚Äôt have previous professional experience in advertising. Your portfolio can showcase your creativity, design skills, and understanding of advertising concepts.

# How to Start:

* **Create Mock Campaigns**: Choose brands or products you like and develop **mock advertising campaigns** for them. Focus on different types of ads‚Äîdigital, print, social media, and video‚Äîto show versatility.
* **Include Personal Projects**: If you‚Äôve done any freelance work, even for friends or small businesses, include it in your portfolio. Projects that show you understand **audience targeting** and **brand messaging** will stand out.
* **Presentation Matters**: Your portfolio needs to be professional. Use platforms like **Behance** or **Adobe Portfolio** to create a polished and visually appealing display of your work.

# 2. Leverage Free Online Courses and Certifications

In the advertising industry, practical skills often outweigh formal education. **Online learning platforms** offer a wealth of free courses to help you gain those skills. By completing relevant certifications, you not only expand your knowledge but also show potential employers your commitment to learning.

# Recommended Free Courses:

* **Google Ads Certification**: Google offers free certifications that demonstrate your understanding of **Google's advertising tools**. This certification is a great addition to your portfolio.
* **Meta Blueprint (Facebook and Instagram Ads)**: Meta provides free courses on how to run effective ads on Facebook and Instagram.
* **LinkedIn Learning**: While not all LinkedIn courses are free, there are plenty of resources available to help you improve your advertising and marketing knowledge.
* **HubSpot Academy**: HubSpot‚Äôs free courses on **content marketing** and **social media strategy** are essential for anyone trying to enter the advertising field.

By showing certifications in tools like **Google Ads**, **Facebook Ads**, and **SEO**, you enhance your credibility, especially if you‚Äôre applying for entry-level positions.

# 3. Network with Advertising Professionals

**Networking** is a critical component of breaking into any industry, and advertising is no different. Building connections with industry professionals can open doors to **internships**, **freelance work**, and even full-time job opportunities.

# How to Build Your Network:

* **Join Advertising Groups on Social Media**: LinkedIn and Facebook have numerous groups for advertising professionals. Join these groups to ask questions, engage in discussions, and learn from experienced professionals.
* **Attend Industry Events**: Many cities host **advertising meetups**, conferences, and seminars. Attend these events to meet people in the field. If you‚Äôre not in a major city, look for virtual events and webinars that allow for remote networking.
* **LinkedIn Outreach**: Create a professional **LinkedIn profile** and reach out to professionals working in agencies or advertising roles. Engage with their posts, ask questions, and let them know you‚Äôre eager to learn and gain experience.

# 4. Start as a Freelancer or Intern

Getting your foot in the door often involves starting with small opportunities. **Freelancing** or **interning** can provide you with practical experience, and even short-term gigs can help you build up your skills and connections.

# Freelance Platforms to Consider:

* **Upwork and Fiverr**: While these platforms are competitive, they provide an opportunity to work on small advertising projects. Even simple tasks like creating Facebook ads or writing copy can help build your portfolio.
* **Internships**: Even if you‚Äôre not enrolled in a formal education program, many agencies offer internships to those looking to break into the industry. These internships can help you learn on the job and provide networking opportunities.

Start small, take on projects you feel confident about, and gradually move to more complex advertising campaigns. Freelance work, even at a lower rate, can eventually lead to full-time opportunities.

# 5. Master the Art of Copywriting and Storytelling

At the heart of successful advertising is **effective copywriting** and **storytelling**. If you can master the art of crafting compelling messages that resonate with your audience, you‚Äôll be a valuable asset in the advertising world, regardless of your lack of formal experience.

# How to Develop Copywriting Skills:

* **Practice Daily**: Write every day. Whether it‚Äôs for a blog, social media, or hypothetical ad campaigns, the more you write, the better you‚Äôll get.
* **Study Successful Campaigns**: Analyze successful advertising campaigns. Look at the copy, the structure, and the overall messaging. What makes it work? How does it connect with the audience emotionally?
* **Books on Copywriting**: Read books like **‚ÄúOgilvy on Advertising‚Äù** by David Ogilvy or **‚ÄúMade to Stick‚Äù** by Chip Heath and Dan Heath. These resources provide timeless lessons on the principles of advertising and copywriting.

# 6. Stay Updated with Industry Trends

The advertising industry is dynamic, with new **trends** and **technologies** emerging constantly. Staying up to date with the latest developments will help you stand out from other candidates.

# How to Stay Informed:

* **Follow Advertising Blogs and Podcasts**: There are numerous blogs and podcasts focused on the advertising world. Popular ones include **AdWeek**, **AdExchanger**, and **Marketing Over Coffee**.
* **Subscribe to Newsletters**: Get industry insights delivered to your inbox by subscribing to newsletters from major advertising platforms or industry leaders.
* **Social Media Engagement**: Twitter and LinkedIn are great places to follow thought leaders in the advertising space. Engage with their content to stay current and build your own network of insights.

# 7. Volunteer for Nonprofits or Small Businesses

If you‚Äôre struggling to find paid opportunities, consider volunteering your advertising skills for **nonprofits** or small businesses. This allows you to gain hands-on experience while making a positive impact.

# Benefits of Volunteering:

* **Real-World Experience**: Working with actual clients gives you the chance to apply your knowledge in a practical setting.
* **Portfolio Building**: Volunteering allows you to expand your portfolio with live projects and case studies.
* **Social Proof**: Having testimonials from clients, even if the work was unpaid, gives your future employers or clients evidence of your skills and professionalism.

# 8. Apply for Entry-Level Jobs and Be Persistent

Once you‚Äôve built a portfolio, gained some freelance or internship experience, and acquired the relevant certifications, it‚Äôs time to start applying for entry-level positions. While it might take several applications before landing a job, persistence is key.

# Tips for Applying:

* **Customize Your Resume**: Tailor your resume to each job you apply for, highlighting the skills and experiences most relevant to the role.
* **Follow Up**: After applying, don‚Äôt be afraid to follow up with the company. A polite email can show your enthusiasm and set you apart from other candidates.
* **Focus on Agency Assistant Roles**: Many people break into advertising by starting in assistant roles. These positions give you access to experienced professionals and can lead to more advanced roles as you prove yourself.

# Conclusion

Getting into advertising without experience is achievable if you approach it strategically. Building a **portfolio**, gaining certifications, networking with professionals, and staying persistent in your job search will help you land that first opportunity. Remember, advertising agencies value creativity, passion, and the ability to think outside the box‚Äîqualities that can shine through even if you don‚Äôt have formal experience.",1,1728920233.0,howtoworkonlinenow,0,1.0,False

2. After not hearing back from him for a few hours, I asked if he was still interested, and he said that he could pick it up on Monday, and I said when I'd be home from work - 5:30pm. He then responds back the next day (Sunday at this point), asking if that's the time I get home every day, and then he assumed for some reason that I worked downtown (I don't - I work 30 minutes from the major city I live from, not sure why he just figured that I worked there) and that he could meet me at my work. I say this won't work. He then asks what time do I leave for work, and I say 7am, and he suggests a porch pickup for that time (which I find strange, to be honest, but I figured he'd swing by to pick it up on his own way to work). I say let's do 7:15 at the nearby coffee shop, since I don't give out my address to strangers on Facebook. He agrees and says he'll see me tomorrow morning. I make it clear that he has to be there at 7:15 sharp due to my having to be at work at 8am. 
3. Tomorrow becomes today (Monday), and I message the guy that I'm now walking up to the coffee shop, Halloween costume in back, trotting through a rain storm that's apparently blown into town. And of course he doesn't show. I message him asking where he is, what's his ETA, and come 7:25, I split, and tell him that I'm not waiting in the rain anymore, and if he wants it, he can have it at 5:30pm tonight. But I don't even want to sell it to the guy at this point, and I kicked myself for extending the offer, and I make it up to me by then asking ""Where were you? We had an agreement?"", to which he just straight up leaves the Marketplace conversation altogether. 

So that was the start of my Monday morning - cold, waiting in the rain with wet shoes and of course I was late to work, on top of annoyingly being strung along and ghosted by some fuckface. So thanks Steve. I hope you see this, and if you do, I hope you get dysentery this Halloween. ",0,1728920191.0,FacebookMarketplace,3,0.5,False

1g3ip66,https://www.reddit.com/r/studentsph/comments/1g3ip66/is_it_possible_to_build_some_sort_of_immunity_sa/,Is it possible to build some sort of immunity sa caffeine?,"Sorry for the long post, please bear with me.

Ever since I started college, hindi na 'ko nakaka-experience ng complete 8hrs of sleep. And since I needed to survive the day with all the lectures and online assessments na binibigay ng profs, I resulted to drinking at least a cup or 2 of coffee. It even got to a point wherein I drank 6 cups in one day.

Hindi naman ako foreign sa pag-inom ng kape. I have been drinking coffee since I was in high school pero madalang and I mostly drink lattes (or something sweet na kape). Pagdating ng gr12, nagsimula na ko uminom ng medyo matatapang na kape. As a student leader at that time, tambak din yung mga gawain ko (isama na yung research). Bareable pa naman sya, at least nakakatulog pa 'ko for at least 4hrs. Minsan pa nga umaabsent ako sa morning classes to get more sleep. This time around medyo napansin ko na na parang hindi na yata tumatalab sa'kin yung kape?

Anyway, college. I'm currently in my 2nd year. I'm not a student leader anymore, nor am I always being picked as a leader sa groupings sa room. It was nice for a change. Pero I have to say, the workload is 2x stressful (what more pa kaya sa mga nag-o-org, 'di ba?) Dito na 'ko nagstart na uminom nang uminom ng kape because I have to keep up. I drank a lot to the point na nagpa-paltitate na 'ko pero I'm still dozing off.

Nung napapansin ko na hindi na gumagana yung coffee, I resulted to drinking energy drinks (right now, more on cobra). At first, gumana sya. I was awake, I have this sudden burst of energy and natapos ko yung workloads ko with time to spare para makabawi ng tulog (which hindi ko nagawa that time kasi gising na gising ako). Few days later, ang dami nanamang pinapagawa so I bought another. To my dismay, I think 30 minutes palang nakakalipas inaantok na ko.

To cut this story short, wala na. Hindi na tumatalab sa'kin ang cobra, sting, and strong coffees. And I'm thinking of considering na magtry ng ibang brand (like monster). Pero ayun, is it possible na maging immune sa caffeine?",1,1728920151.0,studentsph,3,1.0,False

I do drop ins in my spare time outside of my 9-5 job and volunteering at the animal shelter - it gets me out of the house, lets me see new cats, try new coffee shops, and make some extra money. I have Star Sitter status, over 100 bookings under my belt, and I‚Äôve never had a bad experience.

A few weekends ago, one of the cats I was checking in on had a medical emergency, and the experience with Rover was OUTSTANDING. Also - the cat is ok!

A cat we‚Äôll call Oreo ate a LONNNNNGGGG piece of felt string. You can see it in the photos below - on Saturday, the wand toy was there, and by Sunday, it was munched down and about a foot shorter. NOT GOOD. Totally weird accident, but what can you do? Oreo seemed fine, but there was no way that thing was going to come out on its own.

* I first contacted Oreo's owner within the Rover app.
   * I talked to her on the phone, explained what was going on, and we agreed I‚Äôd drive Oreo to the vet in her carrier. I told her I'd figure out the payment for anything with Rover, and that making sure Oreo got the string out of her stomach was the priority.
* I then called Rover's emergency line.
   * Wendi on Rover support guided me through the process and emailed me to confirm she opened a claim.
* By the end of the day, after an emergency endoscopy, Oreo was back home and as happy as could be.
* I submitted all the bills to Rover via email, and the owner also wrote a statement about her experience.

THE BILL WAS $4,325.27!!!! Oh. My. Gosh.

Within a week, I received a check reimbursing me for the total‚Äîminus the $250 deductible, which I split with the owner. UN. REAL. I am amazed at how quickly this was all taken care of.

I was NOT prepared for something like this to happen, but I am grateful I had a car, a credit card, and [The Rover Guarantee](https://www.rover.com/rover-guarantee/) to cover unexpected situations like this!

Thank you, Rover, Wendi at Rover support, and pet owners like Oreo's for making this scary situation as smooth and stress-free as possible. fyi this is not an ad! And if you're in Philly, tell your cat I said pspsps!

I was a college student juggling classes, part-time work at a local caf√©, and the occasional wild night with friends. My days were filled with lectures on literature and late-night study sessions fueled by coffee and determination. But as summer faded into autumn, I craved something different‚Äîa story to tell, a thrill to chase. So when I stumbled upon the babysitting ad for the Holloway family, something stirred inside me. The pay was enticing, and the promise of a spooky evening lured me in like a moth to a flame.

The Holloways had recently moved into an old cabin deep in the woods, a place that had garnered whispers of mystery and strangeness from neighbors. Tales circulated about odd happenings‚Äîstrange noises in the night, sightings of shadowy figures flitting between trees. I was captivated by these stories. They felt like the stuff of urban legends, and I thought, why not? A little adventure would break the monotony of my life.

When I called to accept the job, Mrs. Holloway‚Äôs voice was warm yet laced with something that made me uneasy. ‚ÄúThank you for coming,‚Äù she said, almost too grateful. ‚ÄúWe have a few rules you must follow.‚Äù The weight of her words hung heavy in the air, and a shiver danced down my spine, but I brushed it off as the autumn chill creeping into my bones.

As I drove to their cabin, anticipation twisted in my stomach. The winding road narrowed, flanked by towering trees that seemed to close in around me, creating a tunnel of shadows. The air grew heavier with every mile, and a sense of foreboding seeped in, mingling with the earthy scent of fallen leaves. When I finally reached the Holloways‚Äô cabin, I was struck by its eerie charm. The wooden structure appeared almost alive, nestled in the embrace of the forest. Its darkened windows seemed to watch me as I stepped out of my car, and the faint sound of rustling leaves whispered secrets I wasn‚Äôt meant to hear.

Mrs. Holloway greeted me at the door with a smile that seemed too wide for her face, her eyes glimmering with an unsettling brightness. ‚ÄúWelcome! We‚Äôre so glad you‚Äôre here,‚Äù she said, her tone warm yet unnervingly cheerful. ‚ÄúI hope you‚Äôre ready for a fun night!‚Äù Her enthusiasm felt forced, and I couldn‚Äôt help but notice how her fingers drummed nervously against her thigh as she spoke. But when she began to explain the rules, my heart sank. ‚ÄúThe children must never be alone outside, even in the backyard,‚Äù she insisted, her gaze darting toward the trees, as if she feared something lurking just beyond the threshold. ‚ÄúAnd if you hear whispering at night, it‚Äôs best to ignore it.‚Äù

I swallowed hard, my mind racing with questions. What kind of rules were these? It felt like I was stepping into a horror film rather than just a babysitting job. But I brushed aside my fears, convincing myself that every family had their quirks.

Inside, I met the twins, Jake and Emma. They seemed sweet at first‚Äîfull of energy and laughter. Their faces were innocent, with bright eyes that sparkled with mischief. As they introduced themselves, I felt a flicker of warmth; perhaps this night wouldn‚Äôt be so bad after all. But as the sun dipped behind the horizon, casting the cabin into deeper shadow, I noticed a subtle shift in their demeanor. They exchanged glances that felt laden with unspoken secrets, their laughter echoing off the cabin walls in a way that sent shivers down my spine. It felt as though they were part of a secret world I wasn‚Äôt allowed to enter.

As night settled in, I began to prepare dinner, trying to engage the twins in conversation. ‚ÄúWhat do you like to do for fun?‚Äù I asked, hoping to break the growing tension. They looked at each other before answering in unison, ‚ÄúWe like to play outside!‚Äù The innocent response sent a chill through me, and I hesitated. ‚ÄúWhat about your parents? Do they let you play outside at night?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey don‚Äôt let us go far,‚Äù Emma replied, her eyes darting toward the window. ‚ÄúBut there‚Äôs so much to explore!‚Äù

I forced a smile, but unease twisted in my stomach. The night grew darker, and the cabin seemed to breathe around us, creaking and settling as if it were alive. The air felt charged, thick with unspoken words. After dinner, I suggested we watch a movie, hoping the distraction would ease my nerves. But as we settled in the living room, I couldn‚Äôt shake the feeling that something was off.

Just as the opening credits rolled, the lights flickered and plunged us into darkness for a heartbeat before coming back on. The twins didn‚Äôt flinch; they merely exchanged knowing glances. I forced a laugh, but my heart raced. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just the old wiring,‚Äù I said, attempting to sound casual. ‚ÄúNothing to worry about.‚Äù But even as I spoke, a low growl echoed from outside, making my blood run cold.

‚ÄúWhat was that?‚Äù I asked, my voice trembling.

‚ÄúJust the woods,‚Äù Jake said dismissively, though his eyes were wide. ‚ÄúOur friend is out there too.‚Äù

Panic began to claw at my chest. What friend? My pulse quickened as I peered out the window into the inky darkness. The trees stood tall and foreboding, their branches clawing at the sky like skeletal fingers. ‚ÄúMaybe we should stay inside for a while,‚Äù I suggested, trying to keep my voice steady.

The twins shrugged, but as I settled back into the couch, I couldn‚Äôt shake the sense that we were being watched. The whispers began again‚Äîsoft and insistent, coming from somewhere outside. ‚ÄúIgnore it,‚Äù I reminded myself, recalling Mrs. Holloway‚Äôs warning. But my curiosity gnawed at me, and I turned to look out the window.

That‚Äôs when I saw it‚Äîthe figure lurking just beyond the trees. A tall, shadowy shape that seemed to ripple in the darkness, watching us with an unsettling intensity. My heart raced as I realized it wasn‚Äôt just a figment of my imagination. It was real, and it was hungry.

‚ÄúStay close!‚Äù I shouted, gripping the twins‚Äô hands tightly. But they seemed entranced, their gazes locked on the figure, as if drawn by some invisible thread. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a shadow,‚Äù Emma whispered, but I felt a cold dread settle in my bones. The air grew colder as the figure stepped forward, its long limbs moving with an unnatural grace.

As it emerged from the shadows, I could see its grotesque features‚Äîskin stretched tight over an elongated frame, a face twisted into a predatory grin, eyes glimmering like cold steel. It felt as if the very darkness had coalesced into something malevolent, a predator stalking its prey.

‚ÄúRun!‚Äù I yelled, my voice breaking. The twins hesitated, confusion flickering across their innocent faces. But the moment I pulled them back, the creature lunged, a blur of movement that made my skin crawl. Its mouth opened wider than any human‚Äôs could, revealing rows of jagged teeth that glistened in the faint light.

In that instant, instinct kicked in. I pushed the twins ahead of me, shoving them toward the safety of the cabin. ‚ÄúGo! Get inside!‚Äù I shouted, my heart racing. The creature was faster, its long fingers reaching for me. I stumbled back, desperate to escape its grasp. The air was thick with a stench I couldn‚Äôt identify‚Äîsomething rotten and decayed.

Just when I thought it would catch me, Jake shouted, ‚ÄúLook!‚Äù He pointed to the ground, where a silver object glinted in the moonlight. It was a small metal charm, intricately designed with strange symbols that seemed to pulse with light. ‚ÄúIt can‚Äôt touch us if we have it!‚Äù he yelled, grabbing the charm and holding it up like a beacon.

I didn‚Äôt hesitate. I ran toward the twins, who stood with the charm, and as I reached them, the creature halted, its eyes narrowing. The whispers turned to a shriek as the charm‚Äôs light grew brighter, illuminating the space around us. The creature recoiled, its form rippling like water disturbed by a stone, as though the light was a physical barrier it couldn‚Äôt cross.

‚ÄúNow!‚Äù I shouted, and we darted toward the cabin, the light from the charm pushing the darkness away. The creature howled, a chilling sound that echoed through the trees, but we burst through the door, slamming it shut behind us. My heart thundered in my chest as I fumbled with the locks, the adrenaline coursing through my veins.

Inside, we locked the door and huddled together, breaths coming in ragged gasps. The atmosphere felt charged, the silence oppressive. I could still feel the presence of the creature outside, lurking just beyond the walls. The twins looked up at me, their faces pale but resolute. ‚ÄúWe did it,‚Äù Emma said, her voice barely a whisper. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs not gone. We have to stay strong.‚Äù

Nodding, I realized we weren‚Äôt just babysitting; we were fighting for our lives. I gripped the charm tightly, its warmth a stark contrast to the cold terror still gripping my heart.

Suddenly, a loud bang echoed from the back door, making us jump. The whispers outside intensified, swirling around us like a storm, insistent and mocking. ‚ÄúIt wants in,‚Äù I breathed, my eyes darting to the windows. Shadows danced just outside, and I could see the outline of the creature lurking just beyond the reach of the light.",1,1728919899.0,u_BreakMinute6900,0,1.0,False

-never invites me to family meals always makes sure I‚Äôm on late shift, for example she texted my husband knowing that I was on late shift and never even asked me to his Nana‚Äôs birthday meal, just him anyways karma hit her this time because Nana texted husband saying that it‚Äôs been proposed because MIL is poorly and he replied to say well I hope it can be at a time where I can make it as MIL didn‚Äôt involve me. 

-didn‚Äôt get me a birthday present this year and when confronted by my husband she said that she was wanting to sort out coffee date and told got me some earrings that I can‚Äôt wear due to a metal allergy which she knows about (yet haven‚Äôt received it)

- constantly is asking me when I‚Äôm going to pay for the car that her partner gifted me and never has asked for money when I ask him about it he says we will catch up later. I‚Äôve told her this sets my MH Off and not to do it again. This happened a few weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt spoke to her since.

 -makes dates with my husband so I can‚Äôt attend fair enough she wants to catch up alone but come on it‚Äôs not fair.

-if we ask her to check on our dog she‚Äôs always got an excuse. So we don‚Äôt ask her. 

- I just always get an off vibe about her and I can‚Äôt stand her. I‚Äôm good with vibes and hers are way off. 

I listed them to my husband today and he said well you can explain all of them can‚Äôt you? And I was like but it‚Äôs not the point? And then he said well you don‚Äôt like her so what do you expect?

1g3il3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/RedPillWomen/comments/1g3il3a/meeting_men_without_online_dating/,Meeting Men without Online Dating,"Context: I have been single for almost a year now. I have tried online dating many times, it is not an experience I enjoy. The most successful match I have ever made was a 3-month relationship. Every successful relationship I have had, I met while living my life.

How I started?

* I have natural charm that got highly developed while working in the restaurant business. I know how to engage conversation and light people up. I truly talk to all people - male or female.

* I dabbled with OLD for a few months but realized sometime in the spring I was having more success just meeting men in my everyday life.

* Post wall life! This will be the first time I dated as a post wall woman at 40 (spoiler alert: I don‚Äôt have scales under my clothes).

Goals:

* To have better mental health about dating. I find OLD makes me feel very objectified and that the quality of the men on the apps is not that great (at least for my area). It creates a sense of doom and self-doubt that just isn‚Äôt grounded in reality.

* To enjoy the dating process! I don‚Äôt want to feel like I am on an interview and neither do the men!

Actions I have taken:

* I started exploring alternative times and locations for my current gym membership.

* I go to live trivia at a brewery I really like. It‚Äôs a lot of repeat teams. I chatted up the guys taking up the answers, and chatted up people in line.

* I am in a cornhole league that has 2-3 seasons a year. It‚Äôs a very male dominated league. I like cornhole specifically, because it‚Äôs a wee bit like speed dating. You have to stand next to someone from the opposite team and make small talk.

* My friend and I signed up to volunteer at sports tournaments/races.

* I am a regular at a couple coffee shops close in affluent neighborhoods. I set up there to read a book, journal, or work on admin tasks for my volunteer work.

* I also make a point to go out more on weekends (not something I love). I specifically look for events I think men will attend.

Success Examples:

* Met a guy at my gym (probably mid to late 40s) who was new to the 5am group, but one day I ran into him at 5pm on the same day! I smiled at him when he walked by and said ‚ÄúI am not the only two-a-day here!‚Äù We joked around about being gym obsessed. He asked for my name. We chatted for about a month (this is like 5-minute interactions a couple times a week) and I was literally planning to ask him out (men get weird about asking out women at the gym) - but then he vanished a month ago. He had a job that required travel. If I see him again in the future, I will ask him out.

* Met a guy (31) one night at a bar with some live music (late winter). He did approach me - but he also was helping me get a creeper to go away. We actually exchanged numbers. He never texted me and so I assumed I misread the situation. Then I saw him on a dating app - we matched. He HAD texted me (he showed me the proof) - they just never got delivered. We actually have gone on a few dates.

* I found out there was rugby league having after party (Early summer) to their big regional tournament. I scooped up some girls and we crashed the party. (Bonus: My friend ended up meeting a guy that night unrelated to the rugby teams and they have been dating for like 4 months now! )I talked to a rugby guy (33) I really liked. Unfortunately, he was on a team from another state. But we had a good time partying together.

* A month-ish ago, Found an event at a local bar for a free hot wheel race (yes, toy cars). Again, scooped up a girlfriend and off we went. We were the only girls there in a sea of about 40 men. I actually won second runner up! The men got a big kick out of it. I posted a pic on my Instagram stories, tagged the bar, the bar reshared the story. A guy I spoke to briefly at the bar started following me from the story. We are currently talking and planning to meet up. I also realized THIS WEEK a guy who did talk to me at the bar goes to my gym. I have decided the next time I see that guy to say , ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ did we talk at the hot wheel race?‚Äù.

What I am Working On:

* Trying to be a little more strategic about where I go. Rugby tournament party was fun (a lot of fit men to choose from), but it was more out of town guys than in town guys. Long distance doesn‚Äôt work for me! Maybe focus on volunteering at local small 5ks.

* I want to try a few cross fit gyms. I don‚Äôt really love cross fit, but guys do! Looking for the gyms with a free trial or a cheap first month.

* Check out a few hiking groups. I aspire to be a woman with a camper, so an outdoorsy man is in my wheelhouse!

PS - it might seem as if I plan my whole life around meeting men. Opposite, I plan my life around what I love to do (fitness, socializing with my friends, service work, adventure) - I just always keep my eye out for opportunities to meet men. Much of my social life is in female heavy circles (volunteer work, book club, yoga). If I wasn‚Äôt intentional, I would never be around men ever and would HAVE to use online dating.",6,1728919866.0,RedPillWomen,2,1.0,False
1g3ikr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g3ikr8/i_m31_feel_exhausted_and_burnt_out_with_my_gf_f30/,I (M31) feel exhausted and burnt out with my GF (F30).  What can I do to remedy this or should I?,"Sorry in advanced for the wall of text.

My GF (F30) and I (M30) have been together for a little over 3 years.  In the beginning of our relationship everything seemed fine, but I didn't really start feeling frustrated and exhausted until after she moved in with me just a year into our relationship.  So I'm not sure if I rushed into that decision as this is the first time I've ever lived with a significant other before, but I offered her to live with me based on the following circumstances. 

1) She was getting fed up with her roommate who is her best friend and was close to ending that relationship.  I didn't want that to happen because I know how much she valued that relationship.

2) There is a company where I live that she always dreamed of working at and I wanted to give her a better opportunity to get her dream job.

Things started off great and I was very happy to spend time with her ever day, but I started to feel frustrated after several months of living together.  It first started out with the lack of chores.  On the weekends I like to take care of chores with laundry, vacuuming and dusting every weekend and heavy cleaning of the kitchen and bathroom probably once every week.  I'm a morning person and like to start the chores in the morning so I can have more free time in the afternoon.  She also has a dog that sheds frequently so vacuuming and dusting take up a ton of time.  I'm also heavily allergic to dogs, but I absolutely love her dog and I'm also taking antihistamines and allergy shots so it doesn't bother me all that much aside from all the hair stuck on my clothes.  My gf on the other hand is more of a night owl and loves to sleep in.  I have no issues with that since I used to love sleeping in, but whenever she wakes up she doesn't do any chores.  I would be mid cleaning and as soon as she woke up she would make her coffee and then sit on the couch and scroll through social media.  She rarely took the initiative to clean other things and rarely asked if I needed help.  When she did take the initiative all she did was vacuum and start laundry leaving the rest for me to take care of.  She even promised to to vacuum more often due to how much her dog sheds and because of my allergies, but never did during the week.  After being fed up for a year I sat down with her and voiced my frustrations which she understood and actually did better.  I will say I am horrible with communication and get nervous or anxious when trying to talk or bring up important topics with her.  So I acknowledge that and I'm still trying to fix that.

In addition to chores she's also very lazy.  She does have hobbies like crafts and reading, but barely participates in them and spends most of her time on her phone texting, scrolling through social media, or watching TV.  Don't get me wrong, I can be lazy too and sit on the computer all day watching YouTube videos or playing videos. I'm trying to work on that and actually cut down screen time a considerable amount, but not enough to the point where I'm satisfied and I will sometimes fall into old bad habits so it's still a work in progress.  Personally I've cut out just about 90% of all social media apps and interactions while only using Facebook for a brief scroll or to browse through marketplace for anything I want to purchase for my hobbies.  I've fallen into the trap with social media where I would doom scroll, compare my life to all those social media influencers, and try to chase the social media clout for the most amount of likes for that hit of dopamine.  I've tried to get her to limit her interaction with social media, but have had no luck and it doesn't help that her entire family and most of her friends are using social media all the time.  Whenever we visit and stay at her parents house for the majority of the day every single on of them sits on the couch and are on their phones watching TikTok and sharing videos or scrolling through other social media apps.  She would also always be on her phone while eating, hanging around idly, and before sleep which is a huge issue.  She always has problems falling asleep, but would always be on her phone while in bed.  She would always say how she can't fall asleep yet both her and I pointed out that it's probably her screen time while in bed.  So for about a few weeks she would cut out screen time before bed, but ultimately falls back into her routine.  I've tried getting her to read ""Atomic Habits"" by James Clear *(which I have read and it made a world of difference)* so she could start on the path of making tiny changes, but won't even entertain me and look at the book.  So I honestly don't think I'll win that battle as at this point it seems like she's highly addicted.

She not very active and doesn't like to exercise while I am fairly active with sports and going to the gym.  I am also conscious about what I eat while she is constantly snacking.  Again, that is fine and to each their own, but I personally want to live a healthy lifestyle and I would like for her to as well for several reasons.

1) She has a family history of cancer.  So I figure why not stay as healthy as possible to limit the possibility of developing cancer or at the very least maximize your chances of having a successful recovery.  Strokes and high cholesterol are in my genetics which is why I watch what I eat and try to be physically active as best as possible. My dad had 2 stroke (1 silent and 1 regular stroke) and I saw what that did to him.  It terrified and saddened me having to watching him go through that and I don't want to put my family through that or at least limit that chances of that happening.

2) Why not develop a healthy life style so that I can show my future children and lead by example.  The U.S. doesn't have the best track record of being the healthiest nation with all the fast food, heavily processed foods, and sweets.  My mom even became per-diabetic after spending so much time snacking and not exercising.  On top of all the health issues in my genetics I want my children to lead a healthy life.

3) She's always tired and complains about not having energy even after having her cup of coffee.

4) This is probably shallow and I am fully aware of that, but I am interested in someone who is fit and takes care of their body which also ties into sexual attraction which I am very much attracted to physical appearance.  They don't have to be Olympic athlete or body builder fit, but fit enough.  I take care of my body and physical appearance and I would hope my partner would too.

In the beginning I frequently asked if she would like to join me and she would occasionally say yes, but for the most part she would reject the offer and stay in the apartment.  She did start running on her own in preparation for a half marathon race with her mom and aunt, but only practiced for about 4 months before making excuses not to run.  Now I make excuses too to not exercise and understand the struggle of disciplining or motivating yourself to work out.  I am also fully aware that I am in part to blame cause I would never join her on runs cause of my dislike of running long distances.  She would sometimes diet and watch her calories while removing snacking, but that would only last for a few weeks before falling back to her old routing.  It also doesn't help that her parents are the same way with snacking and lazing around.  She did make a 75 day New Years resolution challenge for this 2024 new year to be more active and diet, but would always give up around the 3rd day of trying.  She has also openly said ""why can't she just be fat"" which I openly shut down and she's also verbally been openly okay to me with being chubby.  I do meal prep for the both of us and now she does too.  I try to make healthy meals with vegetables, proteins, and some grains, but she's picky and won't eat a lot of things.  She used to eat chicken nuggets all the time as a kid and that kinda stuck with her.  She's gotten better over time, but not by much.  I also can't control what snacks are in the pantry as she'll also just stop by the grocery store on her way home from work.  This might be a side effect from her stressful day at work which I can understand.

Lastly I am also trying to build a better future financially.  I was fortunate enough live with my parent following college at no cost aside from the utility bill which was relatively cheap and thanks to them I was able to pay off my student loans and become debt free.  I was able to move out and afford rent on my own.  I've studied to get certifications for my job and am currently studying to get my professional license all while I am together with her.  I've also gotten a temp 2nd job to make more money.  I'm trying to save enough money to buy a house as well as save for my children and my future.  I've made sacrifices with my time to study and get a better job and higher pay so that I don't have to worry about it later on.  I will admit I have gotten lazy with studying, but I am on the path to get back on track for my test by the end of this year or early 2025.  Unfortunately I've not had any reciprocation on her end.  

She's still in considerable debt with student loans and car loans and her job doesn't pay all that much.  I've split rent and utilities with her equitably where she paid $650 per month and I paid the remaining $1,300, but for the last 3 months I took over all payments so she could focus on paying off her debt.  She is trying to look for another job in her field cause she hates her current one and stresses her out daily, but she hasn't put in the effort to market herself and develop more skills.  There is not very much demand in her field, but there is just too much supply making it a very competitive job market.  I was happy when she was trying to learn another skill to add to her resume and started that class in January 2024, but from what I've seen she's barely touched that course and from what we've discussed she hasn't completed it yet and it's almost been a year.  She is also not very conscious about her finances as she had a decent amount of credit card debt before which she thankfully paid off.  She doesn't have any savings and doesn't have an investing account either aside from her companies 401k.  It doesn't help that her parents never taught her and only relatively recently made their own personal investing account.  I tried to teach her and get her to watch financial videos, but met with no success.  Whenever I brought up finances, aside from checking her loan and payment status, she would always get defensive and I would ultimately drop the topic.  We've had a couple talks about reciprocating effort and things would change for a few weeks, but then everything would fall back into the same routine.

She is a very caring person and I love that about her.  She would always support me when we went out to tournaments, always be mindful of what I wanted, and went out of her way to make me feel comfortable.  Given all that she's done for me I still feel exhausted and burnt out at this point.  She is very clingy which to each their own, but it feels like I have to be her happiness.  She doesn't have any friends where we live while all her friends are back where she was and would drive back and forth several times a month.  She makes empty promises and I try to remind her subtly, but she doesn't change.  She also pointed out she wants to be a stay at home mom which I can't agree with let alone support on my own at this time.  If this is how she is now then why would I let her be a stay at home mom just to laze around all day long?  She also wants kids like now cause almost all her close friends have kids, but I'm not comfortable with our financial situation yet and I want to have a house first before starting a family which I'd have to pay for on my own.  We've talked about kids already and that that wouldn't be a reality anytime soon which she wasn't okay with, but understood. 

Has anyone else been in a similar situation?  What can I do to remedy this or just any advise?  I just want a bit of perspective.

I‚Äôve recently freed myself from the shackles of instant coffee, and have moved to brewed ones. I bought Kaldipress and just to try the brew thing for the first time got a few sample packs of Sleepy Owl. 

I‚Äôm not a coffee enthusiast (yet) so I liked Sleepy Owl as well (please don‚Äôt judge aheh!).

Now I think I‚Äôm ready for Blue Tokai, and based on a bunch of comments and recommendations I‚Äôll go ahead with Attikan Estate. I‚Äôm not an espresso or black coffee guy either, and mostly I‚Äôll be making Latte out of it.

Recipe is going to be as follows:
- 14gm pre-ground coffee
- about 60-70ml of water
- about 140ml of hot milk
- some froth to top it off 

Will use the inverted method, one or two paper filters (not sure what‚Äôs the correct way, please suggest while at it), along with the metal filter, that came with the Kaldipress. 

Will stir the concoction for about 3-4 minutes, before squeezing it out of the Kaldipress and then add the hot milk, with some sugar mixed in it beforehand, and then the froth. Will give it a light stir, and sip sip sip!

Any and all suggestions with respect to anything that I wrote are welcome!

1g3ihxn,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1g3ihxn/update_aita_for_breaking_up_with_my_fiancee_for/,Update: AITA for breaking up with my fiancee for telling her best friend she was not engaged? ,"Hey guys, I just got home after talking to my (still) ex-fiancee, and since a lot of people asked for an update, here it is. But, I want to clarify a few things.

As commented on my original post, I pay for the house since I bought it before dating her and I asked her to move in, since it was close to her job. I work from home since I'm in tech, but she had to go to work, that's why I paid for her car, to help her commute (and honestly her salary is shit). I was her partner, so I didn't see any problem with that. I thought she was the one, despite everything, she is smart, funny, we had chemistry, but I felt betrayed. 

To the update.

We met at a coffee shop on the premise we would discuss how to save our relationship, at least, that's what she thought. As soon as we sat down, I asked to see their messages. She got defensive immediately and told me she had deleted everything. I asked to see her phone anyway. She started to cry, ugly cry, asking me to stop. At that point I had already decided I was not going to be part of the relationship anymore, but damn, I was curious. It took a good 20 minutes for her to hand me her phone, a lot of crying, even a waitress asking her if she was ok.

So I read the messages. There wasn't any cheating like nudes being exchanged, them professing their love for each other, but what I read still stung. There was a lot of shit talking about me. A LOT. Texts and texts of them saying how terrible of a person I was, criticizing my hobbies (i like video games and pro wrestling) saying I wasn't a real man because of them and stuff like that. But there where two topics that caught my eye. One where she had told him I was having trouble getting hard and that was frustrating for her. And one where she was complaining about how she didn't want to be ""stuck"" in our relationship.

Yes, I was having problems in bed... because I was sad because my father had passed away (6 months ago) and the ""stuck"" thing, I remember telling her that when we got married, IF SHE WANTED she could leave her job, and I would provide for both of us. I don't know if she took this the wrong way, but I guess it was related to that. I honestly don't know.

By the time I gave her the phone back, she was already giving excuses on why she was saying those things to him, how he was like a ""therapist"" for her, and then she asked me ""don't you complaing about me to your friends?"" and I simply replied ""no, I don't"". She started crying again. I took a pretty deep breath and just said ""just give me the ring back"" (I didn't had the ring with me, like some suggested). She hesitated a bit, but gave it to me anyway. I stood up and asked her to delete my number and to not bother me anymore. 

I called her mom and asked her to pick up her daughter's stuff at my place. Her mom is a good person, I'm just realizing I'm going to miss her as I write this. She understood why I decided to end it, but she didn't asked much, and to be honest, I'm glad she didn't. As for my mom, I didn't called her, I just blocked her for things unrelated to this post, I just realized she never had my back in anything, I was always trying to save an already failed mom-son relationship.

Before I leave, I just want to clarify. I was never against her having male friends, or any type of friends. People are going to cheat, friends or no friends. I remember my dad saying something to me when I was a teenager, he always said ""opportunity makes the thief"", but I do not agree with that. Anyway, since I have the next two weeks off work, I going to figure what to do with the wedding money, drink some booze, play games and watch Monday Night Raw later.

Peace.

PS: sorry for any typos, but I fixed the title now.

(27M),"I‚Äôve (27M) developed a crush on my new flatmate, Alex (23M). We‚Äôve been living together for about 4 weeks, but he‚Äôs leaving in December to continue his master‚Äôs in another country. There are 3 of us in the flat‚Äîme, my best friend Jacob (who‚Äôs also gay), and Alex. Both Jacob and I are gay, and Alex knew that before moving in. We‚Äôre super open about it, and Alex has met some of my friends, who are also gay, and he gets along with them really well.

Even though Alex comes from another city, he has a friend here, and his sister lives just an hour away. We mostly see each other in the flat while cooking since I have my own friend group and he spends time with his course mates and his new friends. One day, Alex suggested the three of us (including Jacob) have dinner together, but when Jacob couldn‚Äôt make it, instead of rescheduling, Alex asked if I wanted to invite one of my friends instead. Which meant that maybe he wasn‚Äôt comfortable being just the two of us. He met an amazing friend of mine that night.

A few nights ago, Alex told me he was going to watch a movie in his room. When I asked which one, he said ‚ÄúCall Me by Your Name,‚Äù a gay romance. I was confused as to why a straight guy would watch that alone. The next day, I asked him how it was, and he said he didn‚Äôt have time to watch it and ended up watching Bottoms (a lesbian comedy) instead.

Then, out of the blue, he asked if I had any plans for the weekend. When I said no, he told me: ‚ÄúI was wondering if you‚Äôd be up to go to a nice cafe and maybe read a book and maybe we could go to the cinema‚Äù. This really threw me off because the only time we‚Äôve hung out, he suggested inviting friends. But now, he‚Äôs asking me to hang out just the two of us and didn‚Äôt mention inviting our other flatmate, even though they get along super well. And he asked me this on Monday for the weekend, which feels like he put thought into it.

On Saturday, we went to a nice cafe (he let me choose between two ‚Äúnice‚Äù cafes) with the original plan of reading our books, but we ended up talking for 2.5 hours straight without even touching our books. It felt very intimate, and when I went to pay for our coffee, he insisted on paying. He then hugged me before me leaving for my piano class.

To add to the mix, I‚Äôve already invited him to a concert this Thursday (after he invited me for coffee), so we‚Äôll be hanging out again soon. I would love it if he took the initiative to ask me out, but I‚Äôm unsure if he sees this as just friendship or if he might be interested in something more.

So‚Ä¶ did he just ask me on a date? Or am I overthinking this? Any advice on how to handle it?",1,1728918953.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

**The Impact of Endotoxin LPS on Mental Health**

An imbalance in gut flora, chronic body inflammation, stress, and unfavorable environmental factors trigger oxidative stress reactions. These reactions produce endotoxin LPS, which enters the human bloodstream. An excessive concentration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in the blood results in inflammation. When the blood-brain barrier becomes compromised, inflammation spreads to the central nervous system, causing disruptions in various neurotransmitters and, subsequently, contributing to mental health issues.

**The Features of Inflammation in the Central Nervous System**

Central nervous system inflammation is marked by specific attributes. Microglia, which act as the brain's immune cells and clean-up crew, play a pivotal role in determining the occurrence of brain inflammation. When microglia remain persistently ""activated"" due to factors like stress, the brain's equilibrium is disrupted. Inflammation doesn't only harm neuronsit can lead to the demise of numerous nerve cells, but it also disturbs neurotransmitter function.

Based on the above knowledge about inflammation, we need to eliminate or reduce the damage of LPS to the brain, which can be dealt with from the following three aspects:

**Step 1: Minimize LPS Entry into the Bloodstream**

To achieve this, dietary adjustments and restoration of gut flora are necessary. This will help decrease LPS levels in the intestines and mitigate the body's oxidative stress response and inflammation.

Anti-inflammatory measures:Fish oil,Probiotics

**Step 2: Supplement a large amount of antioxidants to regulate the immune system and reduce inflammatory cytokines**

When the intestines cannot be repaired in a short period of time, a large amount of antioxidants need to be supplemented to neutralize the body's oxidative stress response, thereby reducing inflammation;

Antioxidant : VC, VE, Œ≤-carotene, polyphenols, flavonoids

**Step 3: Rebalance neurotransmitters in the central nervous system and reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety**

When inflammation cannot be effectively controlled, neurotransmitter nutrients can be supplemented in the short term. Neurotransmitters are chemicals responsible for transmitting messages between neurons, such as dopamine,norepinephrine, and serotonin. A decrease in neurotransmitters affects a person's mood. Today‚Äôs antidepressants modulate neurotransmitters

Nutrients that supplement neurotransmitters: 5-HTP, St John‚Äôs Wort, B vitamins, B9 and B12

# 2. Repair of the structure and function of the brain's prefrontal cortex-amygdala-thalamus

Irregularities in the structure and operation of the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and thalamus are regarded as fundamental factors in the pathophysiology of anxiety disorders.

The brain houses an emotional regulation circuit encompassing the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, hippocampus, hypothalamus, and other interconnected regions. Neuroimaging and studies involving animal models have revealed that structural or functional irregularities in these brain regions are potentially linked to depression and anxiety \[17\]\[18\].

https://preview.redd.it/555ielygsqud1.png?width=2342&format=png&auto=webp&s=b900496ce97ade2be176b6827d8ab4d3b78e62b8

Studies show that individuals suffering from depression undergo a reduction in specific brain regions. In the case of depressed patients, their hippocampus is notably smaller in comparison to those without depression. Remarkable alterations in hippocampal size become apparent between 8 months and 1 year into a depressive episode. Prolonged periods of depression, without prompt treatment, can result in further reductions in the hippocampal size. Conversely, timely treatment for depression can lead to a recovery in the volume of the hippocampus \[19\]\[20\].

Pathological anxiety and long-term stress can lead to the reduction of **Brain-derived neurotrophic factor** (BDNF) neurotrophin in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, reducing neuroplasticity. The circuits in the prefrontal cortex, amygdala, and hippocampus cannot be properly activated and reorganized according to the environment, resulting in structural degradation. and functional impairment, thereby increasing the risk of mental disorders. \[21\]\[22\]\[23\]

But the damage is reversible and can be reversed through drug and non-drug treatments. \[24\]

We can take nutrients to increase BDNF levels, nourish brain nerves, prevent or reverse brain neuron atrophy and increase cell survival, so that brain function and structure can be repaired:

Brain cell: Omega-3, VB, choline, phosphatidylserine, PQQ

BDNF: Omega-3, polyphenols, prebiotics, coffee cherry extract

Cerebral blood flow: Ginkgo leaf extract

1g3i5tj,https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestionsuk/comments/1g3i5tj/looking_for_advice_after_completing_a_javascript/,Looking for advice after completing a JavaScript bootcamp,"TLDR: I quit my job to complete a software engineering (JavaScript focused full-stack) bootcamp. I completed 2 group projects and 1 solo project during the course. The bootcamp then advised all of us to list these projects as paid contracts for fake companies/clients. I‚Äôm now really struggling with keeping up the lies in interviews. I honestly wish my struggles could be purely around just ‚Äúbeing good enough‚Äù but it‚Äôs not ‚Äì it‚Äôs more around the mental gymnastics of maintaining plausible lies surrounding these experiences.

I worked as an IT auditor for a large accounting/consulting firm and eventually quit my job because I really wanted to transition into a software development role. In my spare time I worked on learning the basics of JavaScript to be able to enrol in a bootcamp. I then quit my job once I got accepted into the bootcamp and spent 3 months completing the course.

The bootcamp was split into 2 parts. The first part was designed to ensure everybody was up to speed with JavaScript fundamentals. The second part was centred around project work. The first project I completed was a solo project, and then the next 2 projects were completed in small groups.

By the end of the bootcamp, we were advised to update our LinkedIn/CVs to portray our involvement in these projects as professional experience (short-term contracts for imaginary clients). I was never comfortable with this approach, but when faced with the reality that all of my peers are doing it and many have received jobs, I felt that I had no choice but to do as I was advised.

Over the past 6 months I‚Äôve been trying this approach and have made it all the way to live coding rounds before getting rejected. I‚Äôve never received a final round though. I usually get feedback indicating that while I was able to complete the live coding rounds, they feel that they want to hire someone with more experience (these places are typically startups with only 5+ employees). I get the strong sense that they feel something isn‚Äôt quite right with my delivery given they pass me through at least a couple of rounds before making this decision. For example, despite being able to eventually solve their coding rounds I might have arrived at my solution in a way that clashes with the pitch I give of being a currently employed (or recently contracted) software developer. Additionally, I‚Äôll have to create all kinds of plausible responses to questions regarding imaginary team setups (e.g. at what stage in the SDLC we start testing, processes regarding which individuals perform code reviews, how I source clients, processes that occur once I source a client to ensure that requirements are properly captured and how communication is maintained with the client during a particular piece of work, etc).

I‚Äôm desperately looking for advice on how to break in to my first software development role given my background / situation. I‚Äôve looked online and I can‚Äôt find anything that matches this situation. When I asked the Bootcamp careers advisor about axing the false narrative and simply putting these projects down as personal projects I was told that they have no data to backup whether this would work and that it would be very unlikely for me to get my foot in the door for interviews.

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this. If anybody has any advice for me I‚Äôll gladly take it. I‚Äôm based in London and would be happy to meet for a coffee or chat over the phone as well.",4,1728918806.0,cscareerquestionsuk,3,1.0,False
1g3i5fo,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1g3i5fo/hypo_episode_need_advice/,Hypo Episode - Need Advice,"I‚Äôm currently diagnosed as a type 2 diabetic, and normally take 500 mg of metformin in the morning and at night. I manage my diet well, but I had a really off day on Friday when I was meeting clients all day and didn‚Äôt have a chance to eat a proper meal until around 4 pm. By then, I was feeling rough and had a headache. Up until that point, all I‚Äôd had was a coffee in the morning and some chocolate-covered pecans from a gift shop, which was all I could find.

I realize now that I should have prioritized eating, even if it meant being late. I plan to pack snacks or meals for days like this in the future to avoid a similar situation.

Anyway, by the time I finally ate at 4 pm, my blood sugar spiked over 200 and stayed high. When I was hungry again around 6 pm, I decided to take an extra 500 mg of metformin to try and bring it down, especially since I was eating a high-carb meal for dinner. Big mistake.

Within three hours, I ended up in an ambulance with my blood glucose level in the 40s. I felt horrible‚Äîlike I was dying. I had 45 fast-acting carbs (two juice boxes and a glucose gel) before they arrived, but my blood sugar was still only 52 when the EMT‚Äôs got there 20 minutes later. As a new mom, all I could think about was passing out and not waking up. I‚Äôve only had one other severe hypo episode before, and that was when I was pregnant and on insulin.

I didn‚Äôt think metformin could cause such a drop. Was it a combination of not eating earlier, or did the extra dose push me over the edge? How can I prevent this from happening again? My endocrinologist wants to test me for type 1.5 at my next appointment, so I‚Äôm wondering if that might be part of what‚Äôs going on.

1g3i29r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1g3i29r,First road trip. Pretty underwhelmed üò´,"Hi all, 

So, my wife and I decided to go to Austin, TX for the day, on Saturday, for a good meal and some shopping. And to test Zoe, our new Blazer EV RS AWD. We live in San Angelo, which is about 202 miles NW of ATX door to door. We charged to 100% the night before. The car said we had a range of 299 miles when we left our driveway. We thought, oh, we might make it all the way to our destination in Austin before we need to fill up again. I also changed the driving mode from sport to normal. How silly and naive of us, lol. 

First issue, is the vehicle's google map. It kept fighting me on the proper route. It kept missing the Tesla supercharger along our route, and was trying to take us 1.25hrs out of the way to a different company's charging station. I had to set the route up in the myChevy app, then send it Google maps, then send it to the car. Geezus. And yes, I updated the vehicle the other day and the map has the EV options, and I'm all set up with Tesla as well, but gd it was a PITA. 

Our plan was to drive through a town called Llano, and see how we were doing range wise, and if we needed a charge, we could grab a coffee and use the Tesla superchargers there. Well, as we took off from home and got on the open road, we have 75mph speed limits, and the range plummeted. I was shocked. I set the active cruise control to 75mph, not even the overage I usually go, jaja, so nothing crazy there. The range estimate was dropping off almost 2 miles for every 1 mile in reality. 

We got to Llano, about 128 miles from home, and not only would we not make it to Austin, but we were very low on range. So very underwhelming I must say. So, we charged to 80% at the Tesla supercharger in 20ish mins, and continued on to Austin. We thought we could get there, and do our thing, and fill back up in Llano going home. Remember, it was a day trip. 

But no, we got to Austin with 45% battery and felt we needed to charge again in downtown. So we found a Chargepoint station a few blocks away from our needs. We again charged to 80% while we ate and shopped. We did that and headed home. 

We got back to Llano with low range again. Now, where I made a huge mistake, was I charged to only 80% at the same Tesla superchargers we used earlier that day, while we had a bite. We thought we'd be fine to head home, not thinking we originally left our house with 100% and lost a ton of range to Llano, so now leaving with 80%, in hindsight, was a mistake. As the mileage range plummeted as we drove home, we began to get range anxiety. The range was again falling to a 2-to-1 ratio from EV miles to real-world miles. We started getting phone numbers ready to call for tow trucks and planned what a pain in the ass running out of electricity would be, lol. I dropped the cruise control to 65mph, 10mph under the effing speed limit, which is nuts. The range did seem to prolong a bit better. After about 30 minutes of that, the battery stabilized around 22% and it took a long bit to get under 20%. It seemed almost as there was a sticky point at the 20% mark. The plummetting range rate slowed greatly, and we ended getting home with 17% battery left. 

This trip was, to say the least, not easy going, and very stressful. Fighting for the EV spot in downtown Austin was also stressful, since so many EVs were making rounds to grab one of the 8 stations, with only 5 working. We kept cool heads, but to do 75mph and see how fast the range plummeted was very disappointing. Having to do 65mph in the last stretch was also annoying. 

This is West Texas, so more charging infrastructure will help, but this is far from prime-time ready. My wife demands we just drive our Jeep Grand Cherokee 4xe PHEV from now on, lol. 

Another bummer was how much it cost. It was a total of $49 to charge twice in Llano, and downtown Austin. It would have more if we charged to 100% coming home in Llano, and way more time consuming. We can fill up our 4xe for $60 and go round trip no prob. 

I guess if we have no rush to be anywhere, want to spend hours researching the route ahead of time, and can keep cool when fighting for an EV spot at non-Tesla DC Fast Chargers, we'd use Zoe again, but I think it'll be a long while before we go on the open road across Texas anytime soon.

I‚Äôm a guy in his mid/late 20‚Äôs and I recently started online dating (bumble, tinder, & hinge). Within a week I got a few likes on all apps but only one of them would person consistently reply back through Bumble. 

She was definitely on the pretty side and although she didn‚Äôt reply more than once or twice a day, she caught my attention. A couple of weeks ago she sent me a message saying she doesn‚Äôt use the app as much anymore and gave me her phone number to start talking on there. Immediately I got hyped up bc I think I finally met someone cool af!

We text for a couple more days until I ask her out for coffee and she agrees. The day we met was maybe slightly uncomfortable for the both of us upon meeting (usual nervousness) but we both shook it off and the whole vibe felt relaxed. We ended up talking for a solid 3 hours (I know, long date!) and said our goodbyes. We both messaged each other as well saying we both had a great time and look forward to the next ones. 

Things felt good for once and we kept texting on a daily basis until it finally happened. This past Thursday night I received my last text message from her and haven‚Äôt heard from her since. I even tried sending her a message yesterday asking if she had some availability to meet up and got no reply either.

At the end of our last date, I tried to kiss her, thinking things were going well, but she leaned away, making it super awkward. She ghosted me for two days after that until I called her. After some prying, she told me the kiss attempt was overwhelming, and that it‚Äôs best we don‚Äôt continue seeing each other.

I just can‚Äôt shake the feeling that she was leading me on, especially since she‚Äôd only talk to me when she had the time. It‚Äôs frustrating because I‚Äôve been cheated on twice before, and I always give 100% in relationships.

I have been lurking for a while but I finally feel good about posting for the first time. I (30m) went on a date with a girl yesterday for coffee and it went great! We had a lot in common and we didn't stop talking during the 2 hours we were there. We had a really open discussion about our hobbies, our jobs, our family, etc. I have a daughter from a previous relationship and I did make that clear in my Hinge profile. We talked about it and she seemed to be really supportive of it and when I asked she had no issues with possibly seeing someone with a child.

When we were talking she offhandedly mentioned me taking her a corn maze (I was really taken back by this, to me she was really interested at this point) and I obliged saying ""I guess we will have to make that our second date"". We left the coffee shop and went for a small walk and I brought her back to her car. We talked again about the second date and she said she would be happy to plan it (again another good sign she is really invested) and then when we hugging goodbye we kissed and she said ""I was really hoping you would do that"", which confirmed my feelings. I drove home from the date and we texted quite a bit from there.

In the past I have been in what I would call ""love bombing"" situations (both from me and my ex's) and I am really trying to avoid this moving forward. I would also say I have a bit of an anxious attachment due to trauma from my ex wife so I am trying to keep that in from of my as well. We have a date planned for Thursday. How do I stay measured in my approach and ""keep my cool"" persay?",1,1728917694.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1g3hojv,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1g3hojv/we_are_breaking_up_me_28m_and_my_gf26f_about/,We are breaking up me (28M) and my gf(26F) about small issues and conversations and i do not know how to fix it ?,"Me and my girlfriend have been in a relationship for 2 years now. It is a long distance relationship, however we see each other each month (we visit each other), and we call/video every single day. We traveled together and all and all everything is great we love each other. 

Lately the relationship, seemed to be colder, we got a little distant (literally), and things weren't going that great (not so great, not so bad, indifference we may say). However the big issue that seems to be repeated, is that the converstation isn't going through, I mean when we talk about important stuff or we want to dicuss and we sit down we talk great, however in everyday situation the situation seems to get stuck and take a bad turn, and the reason seems to be that we have a before judgement before we speak. 

For example: One time we were talking about taking the train ticket to her city, and she said that you can find train tickets for 20 euros. I have been going for about two years i never saw a train ticket for less than 30, so i was like, no seriously it cant be, (then she told that once, but i thought she talked about something else, or it was a figure of speach), anyways, i went to verify and see, but she got angry because i did not believe her.   
A recent one was getting off the train and going to my home and there are two metros to take, and i was like we are going to take the A metro, while she said we always take the B metro, i said that we took it once or twice at the begninng because the B wasn't working, and we kept fighting, no the other time we did x and x, and i am like no i know better its my city, i like to take the A metro not the B.

anyways in the end the converstation gets irritating and we are both angry and we feel like ouf we cant even talk normal. 

Today something similar happened that tipped everything (small issue with the coffee just like the metro), and we are breaking up. 

I must say that we love each other, and there are lot of great things, we have the same vision, goals, we traveled together, we go out we have fun, but sometimes there these things, now i am not about who's right and who is wrong, i also hate those conversations that they continue to be about what i said and what she said instead of going forward, but i also feel like these are small things, that maybe (i dont know) with time + effort we learn to walk around them and we don't have to break up. 

I also want to be practical,   
Who have been in this situation and what did you do ?  
Can anyone suggest to me a book that can help me/us, learn to talk better, listen better ?  
Thank you.

1g3hnn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CUTI/comments/1g3hnn4/feeling_exhausted/,Feeling exhausted ,"A little bit of background‚Äì had some UTI‚Äôs as a child and a teen. Experienced the odd one into early adulthood, then almost none for years. Granted I (28F) was less sexually active during my last relationship. I did however experience chronic yeast infections in the beginning of that one which resolved eventually. I do know that I experience bladder pain when I‚Äôm dehydrated or drink too much coffee without an infection.

Long story short (ish) I‚Äôve had a stressful year. My last relationship ended in flames. My body was literally rejecting him and not in the form of UTI‚Äôs. My muscles would literally clamp up and I would bleed after intercourse. I went on antidepressants and benzos (temporarily) to cope when things ended. I was probably not taking great care of myself. I started smoking nicotine again and drinking. I got better though and I met someone new which is what leads me here.

I have had 3 UTI‚Äôs since early June. First one was treated with macrobid which caused a delayed reaction in the form of hives everywhere. Cue antihistamines and Benadryl. Was moving home at this time so high stress. Thought I was in the clear but didn‚Äôt feel quite right. Bam another one in early august with blood. Was treated with Cipro which made me feel awful and also left me with lingering symptoms for a bit. I will admit I wasn‚Äôt taking either of them 100% as directed due to my emotional state. 

Just landed another UTI last week and was prescribed Septra and got a referral to a urologist. I also cut coffee and nicotine cold turkey because f*ck this shit. I know the nicotine and caffeine are not helping. Possibly unrelated but also tapered off my benzos because my prescription is done. I am regularly tested for STI‚Äôs and will be using condoms 100% of the time going forward, as well as upping my hygiene. I have spoken very openly with my new partner about this. He is willing to get tested, take medication and ensure we are doing everything to avoid issues. We avoided sex this time to let me heal. Additionally I have added D-Mannose and probiotics back into my routine. I even stopped wearing fake nails which I can only imagine harbour a ton of bacteria. If it matters, I‚Äôm on combination birth control and that has always screwed up my lady bits. Notably I no longer suffer from clamped muscles or bleeding after intercourse. My body very much welcomes my new partner. 

I‚Äôm just tired and wondering if anyone can offer me some words of wisdom. I can‚Äôt stop doom scrolling over this and worrying that this is my life now. I also don‚Äôt want it to affect my new relationship which is absolutely wonderful.

I‚Äôm curious how long I can go but without pushing myself.

That being said, I‚Äôm very self aware and I‚Äôve already started getting sleep deprivation hallucinations like the shadow people i can only see out of the corner of my eye, everything looks like its moving when its not, and my brain trying to convince me the lamp in the corner is a man watching me when ever I look away. 

I wont be driving or doing anything could be unsafe so this is fine, I‚Äôm sure my reaction time is more impaired then I realise. I don‚Äôt have manic episodes so its not that

I am prescribed aderrall ir and only lasts 4 hours, and my last dose was 25 hours so its not that. I barely touch caffeine these days so its not that either.

Some fun hallucinations are colors just looking wrong, thinking that there was blood on my phone screen, seeing dragon flies in my home, (not fun) thinking their are large spiders nearby(every time i ignore them, it actually is a spider).

I don‚Äôt do drugs so this isn‚Äôt a bender or trip and i‚Äôm not schizophrenic. I almost stayed awake for five days out of curiosity as a teen and that was the first time I delt with hallucinations out side of the times I had fevers so high that I should have been hospitalized.

I had a really bad bout of insomnia for 7 months a few years ago while in school full time, and it go so bad I almost put my self to sleep forever. Melatonin never works for me and coffee just makes me anxious.

My sleep schedules really consistent though I went from 10-12 hours of sleep to a steady 8 over the past year

Hallucinating that my hands were bloody was the weirdest one.

1g3hgh3,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1g3hgh3/business_and_pleasure_gray_area/,Business and pleasure - gray area?,"I matched with a POT recently on seeking, where we chatted for a bit before switching to texting. Fast forward a week and we grabbed coffee in person. Most of the conversation was sexual, sharing likes and dislikes, experiences and things we want to explore. But we did discover that we work in the same industry. 

He was excited to find this out and started fantasizing about how hot it would be to cross paths at work or work events we might both be at, and no one know that he‚Äôs secretly seeing the cute Japanese gal. He said his business partner would probably try to hit on me and he loved knowing that his partner couldn‚Äôt have me. But that he needs discretion so it would just be our hot little secret. I was pretty blunt and said I‚Äôd keep things super professional if that were to happen - I prefer to keep work and pleasure separate. 

The chances of him and I actually crossing paths at work are slim, but not zero (for context, this isn‚Äôt a traditional office job setting). And I know I‚Äôd maintain professionalism. But the idea of seeing an SD while I‚Äôm working sounds so unsexy.

I do think this warrants having a conversation with him, but before I do I just want to know if this seems weird to anyone else or if I‚Äôm overthinking. ",1,1728917033.0,sugarlifestyleforum,2,0.67,False

1g3he3s,https://www.reddit.com/r/glossier/comments/1g3he3s/i_blind_bought_doux_and_reve_from_yet_another/,I blind bought Doux and Reve- From yet another obsessed OG You lover,"I bought Reve and Doux the hour they dropped. I personally thought Glossier was fading away but to my delighted surprise, Glossier drops these two grenades on us. My heart soared when I saw they were dropping TWO new perfumes. If they can create You, these HAVE to be somewhat as magical....right?

Creative marketing, influencing, packaging, imagery, aside..... I am...... not wowed. I want to emphasize that I blind bought these because of the trust I had from what they built from You. You is so unique. It has become, what I think, Glossiers signature- maybe even their backbone or foundation of distinctive products. Not to mention You launched in 2017- they had a lot of time to develop these new scents, and decided to replicate two of the TOP scents currently. Le Labo Santal 33, and Tom Ford Lost Cherry. Now I am unsure if that was intentional for them to do but....my point is they had a chance to be as one-of-a-kind again as they were with You and IMO it has fallen flat. BUT...I digress...

I am done being harsh. Onto the actual scents.

**Reve**- Instantly you get the plum butter, and hint of sandalwood. Its sweet but not in a way you are used to. Do not get sweet mixed up with vanilla. This is not vanilla. This is an undertone of nostalgia type of sweet. I say nostalgia because this is supposed to be a grown up scent! You can wear this day or night. That sweetness leaves and you're left with the ambrox, that base note. Its salty, its warm. A bit spicy but not in the nose. You have the hint of toasted almond to make you keep smelling you wrist- going ""do i like this?"" you do.. it just has to sit. Personally I dont loooove this scent. Its a bit juvenile for me. I personally like cleaner, sophisticated, lighter scents. I wouldnt say this is sophisticated. This is a fun, light hearted, dancing scent. You laugh with this scent, you go on a date with this scent on a friday night, you have a girls night with this scent, you wear sparkly tops in this scent and order cosmos.... You dont wear this to work, you dont wear this to church, you dont wear this in the morning, and you dont wear this if youre feeling.... clean? I hope I painted that picture well.  (again all my opinion)

**Doux**- Instantly spice to the brain. This is musk. This is masculine. ALMOST a hint of mint...? Yes, that smokiness its familiar. The myrrh is interesting. You're like ""what does myrrh smell like""... it smells earthy, like incense.. but in this case when the that myrrh scent dries down it plays nice with the base notes that stands- frankincense and ambrox also of course that palo santo comes through. It is all cohesive. Theyre smoky, salty, addictive but it sort of smells like leather? This is your clean boyfriend wearing a brown leather belt and his leather wallet with a new haircut but not in an annoying/headache way. This is fresh but sultry, cozy, cool girl. When I see people saying its creamy I am not understanding.  I am not picking up creamy notes at all. I actually wish it was a bit more powderty and more feminine. You wear this all year long, in a white t shirt and jeans, on a night out with your parnter, to a bar with your co-ed friend group, to your families house for dinner, to your in-laws, on that lux vacation. You do not wear this to meet a new born baby... its strong. LOL.

**All to say**- I recommend for friends to TRY. I do not recommend to blind buy. Glossier You will always have my heart as it is musky, gender neutral, unique, peppery, powdery, feminine. You wear it on double dates with your fianc√©, to your pilates class, to work, to coffee, to your favorite bar with your sister, to see your nana on a sunday, to your Invisalign appointment, to watch football with your guy friends... And every single time, someone will ask You ""hey...um... what perfume are you wearing?""..... <3",6,1728916868.0,glossier,3,0.8,False

Im not gonna lie.. so far, i dont really care for tea.

I like espresso, i like alcohol ( straight whiskey / vodka / gin ) 

I have trouble finding a tea that id go out of my way to drink. Something that after coming home from a long days work, will scratch that itch for a drink to wind down with.

Flavors i dont care for:

- too fruity
- plain black tea
- plain green tea
- chamomile
- earl grey
- plain pepermint
- plain lemon

When i drink a plain tea, fruity, black, etc, i tend to ask myself why im not just having juice, or lemon water, or matcha, etc... id like a tea that stands on its own as an interesting flavor, and is decaf.

What i have liked:

- ginger ( the strong powdered stuff I have enjoyed, but not sure i want all that spice and intensity every day. pure ginger tea on its own kinda feels like lightly spiced water maybe theres a good inbetween one out there? )
- chai ( On a regular thou id much rather go to coffee thou since it reminds me of that, being as hearty as it is )
- oolong ( had once, i dont remember the brand but i remember enjoying it


Would a white tea be for me? with a hint of fruit? 
Or maybe theres an oriental / different flavor profile im not aware of? 

I just know i need to replace my after work whiskey bc its doing nothing for me. Decaf espresso i like, but i down it fast, and doesnt have the same.. ""sit and wind down"" vibe to it. 

Any good after work decafs you might suggest?

Im willing to experiment and buy a few. 

Thanks

:)

I'm looking for something that has nutty or chocolate tones to it.

I've had:

Ippodo:

- Sayaka/Horai-  alright, I find the flavor to be muted. I wish it was stronger but I like it.

- Ikuyo- not bad for the price. Pretty vegetal which I'm not a huge fan of. I probably wouldn't get this again but as a back up it's not a bad choice.

- Seuin/Shoin-  don't like this one. Not sure why it's more expensive than Sayaka/Horai. It's vegetal and bitter. I don't understand this one. I need honey with it or else I won't drink it.

- Tsukikage- their fall seasonal. Liked this one a lot but similar to Sayaka/Horai it's flavor is fairly muted. I like the chocolate and nutty tones it has.

Naoki:

- Yame blend- really like this one. I haven't tried their other blends because people tend to review it poorly outside of Amazon reviews. I like the strong, upfront flavor and don't mind the dry after taste that much (wish it weren't there but don't mind it). Haven't tried their other blends. ",1,1728916116.0,tea,0,1.0,False

This allows me to drink more coffee with less caffeine overall compared to a double shot. 

Attempting to recreate these single shots have led me to an interesting and challenging problem. I am aiming to do a shot of 7-8g to 21g of output while using a 58mm porta filter. Using the single shot basket leads to unsatisfying results and a mess. Using the double basket with around 14-20g of coffee results in me splitting the shot and leading to waste.

In my research I did identify the potential of using a special funnel and tamp around 41mm which would allow for a better extraction.. Are most bars really using this method?

So my few questions are:

1. Are most cafes or bars using single shot baskets or are they using a double basket and splitting the shot? What sort of basket and dosage are they typically using?

2. What's the most optimal way to get a simple smaller dose of espresso most akin to ones you would find in cafe bars in Europe?

I'm not interested in decaf or half caf shots and prefer not to waste coffee!

Hi fellow Euro-folks, I have a lot of extra time on my hands, so I decided to do this for fun. I really liked trying out non-mainstream skincare from various countries and here are some of my thoughts. I would enjoy if anyone has their own contribution from a specific country!

# UK: Nature Spell

I consider this a high-quality brand with lots of well-picked ingredients and actives, with products which really deliver what they promise. They seem solutions-oriented without too much PR fluff. I relied on their bakuchiol cream throughout my pregnancy and I‚Äôm very, very happy with it. I‚Äôve read about how many bakuchiol products do not have their claimed % of bakuchiol, but this cream made me look visibly fresher.¬†

Products I tried and liked: Bakuchiol moisturizer (my current bakuchiol HG product, it has 1% Bakuchiol + 1% Hyaluronic Acid + 2% Squalane + Avocado + Matcha Green Tea), 1% Bakuchiol+Squalane firming serum, BHA sea moss serum, Vitamin C cream

Other products I‚Äôve tried: shower gel (it‚Äôs fine, a nice smelling shower gel, decently moisturizing).

Ironically, I don‚Äôt have much to say here, but this is one of my top brands right now and I wholeheartedly recommend it.

# Latvia: Mossa

Skincare consistent with its geographical area of origin. Just imagine what you would need if you lived in the north next to a windy sea. Creamy, mild, nourishing, but underwhelming concentrations of actives, doesn't really deal with major skin issues except dryness and cold exposure. I‚Äôve tried four of their products and they are all thick (but not clogging!) and leave a film on your skin which someone with dry skin might enjoy, but not me.

What I liked: Juicy Clean purifying AHA cleanser (great for winter, it feels pleasant and gentle on the face, but I didn‚Äôt notice any purifying effects -¬† it has AHA but no BHA), Youth Defense Antioxidant Day Cream (thick and nourishing and a bit firming)

What I disliked: the Vitamin Cocktail face oil (too much going on here since it is made of 10 different kinds of oils - too oily and makes my skin look inflamed rather than refreshed - maybe it‚Äôs the orange tint?), Skin Perfector Nude BB cream (this does give you a discreet glow, but it assumes you already have flawless skin because the coverage is like 0.5/10, it‚Äôs for when you want to look nice sitting at home. It does not particularly even out skin tone)

The conclusion is that their approach is not a good match for my combination skin with imperfections, and the actives are just not activing much - as if their focus is on gentleness and protection rather than targeting concrete problems.

# Greece: Korres

Here we have a somewhat different mood. Mediterranean joie-de-vivre paired with ancient herbal wisdom and love for nature.¬†

What I noticed with all Greek skincare I‚Äôve tried - they really like putting a lot of fragrance in their skincare (Apivita being the worst offender so far).¬†

What do I say about Korres? It‚Äôs good, but pricey. The products feel special and luxurious, although slightly old-fashioned. It's not the latest science, but it works. The scents are gorgeous, the philosophy inspirational.¬†

I liked every product I tried, here they are: Lilac shower gel (gorgeous smell which lingers long afterwards, but it isn‚Äôt particularly moisturizing), AHA+BHA mask (*really strong* peeling effect, a combination of physical and chemical exfoliation), Volcanic clay mask (efficient at purifying), Santorini Grape Poreless cream (l like how it feels and works, but it is heavy on jojoba oil and only has grape extract, I expected something more lightweight), Greek Yogurt cleanser (a real star in my book, soothing and replenishing, skin immediately looks healthier - gonna be repurchasing this a lot).¬†

There is one product that didn‚Äôt work very well, and that is the eucalyptus insect repellent.

# Germany: Hej Organic

This one I only found out about recently and I was very curious to try out. I only got two products and one sample and I find them nice - just okay. Nothing mind-blowing.¬†

I tried the Cactus all-rounder 24h cream (good), the enzyme peel (great), and I got a sample of their Glow Drops (meh).

Note about the cream: it‚Äôs good for its purpose, but here‚Äôs what irks me: right after water, the second ingredient is soja glycine oil. I know the data says it‚Äôs good for your skin, but 1) It was advertised as a ‚Äúcactus cream‚Äù and the cactus is only an extract toward the bottom of the ingredient list - it‚Äôs a pet peeve of mine when they advertise a cream as ‚Äúcactus‚Äù or ‚Äúgrapefruit‚Äù or something alluring like that and then the major ingredient right at the top is soy, sunflower or some other cheap oil while the advertised ""flavor"" is barely found as an extract or even fragrance; 2) I personally prefer squalane or shea butter as a cream base, and not various oils, but I noticed a lot of organic brands really like their sunflower and soy oils.

The enzyme peel - this was my first  enzyme peel ever so I have nothing to compare it to, but I love how it works, and it‚Äôs in powder form so you can choose how much to put on. Mild but effective. Very refreshing!

Glow Drops - did not like these much. The coverage and the glow are a lot better compared to Mossa‚Äôs BB cream, but the particles they put in there are too large, so it makes you look cakey. This would work for someone with super smooth, baby skin who can wear heavy makeup otherwise, but I hated the powdered look of my face.¬†

1g3gw1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/SatisfactoryGame/comments/1g3gw1w/10_stability/,1.0 Stability,"**Hello Pioneers!**

Hope you're all doing well!

I‚Äôve been having a really tough time with Version 1.0 in terms of stability, and I‚Äôm wondering if anyone else is still running into frequent crashes? My game typically crashes anywhere between 5 minutes to 2 hours of playtime. Right before it happens, the audio cuts out, and then the whole system freezes. I can't even use Task Manager to close it because the game completely locks up my PC‚Äîonly the reset or power button helps. Is anyone else still dealing with this, or did the patch fix it for most of you?

I‚Äôve tried everything I can think of to fix it, including:

* Verifying the game files
* Deleting and reinstalling the game
* Installing it on a different drive
* Disabling all overlays (RivaTuner, GeForce Experience, etc.)
* Updating all drivers
* Testing several different GeForce driver versions
* DX 11 / DX 12 and Vulcan

I also posted a question on the Q&A site (https://questions.satisfactorygame.com/post/66e6bf34772a987f4a8b1821) and saw that a few others are having the same issue, but no solution has worked for me so far.

**Specs:**

* Ryzen 9 5900X
* MSI RTX 4090
* 32GB RAM
* Game installed on an M.2 SSD, running Windows 11 via Epic Games

What really puzzles me is that Update 8 ran almost flawlessly with very few crashes, but the full release feels so unstable. How could things go so wrong when everything was working fine before?

1g3gups,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1g3gups/clash_with_mil_my_breaking_point/,Clash with MIL: My Breaking Point ,"First of all, I want to thank everyone who has given me advice on my previous posts. Your support has helped me find my backbone and realize that it‚Äôs not all in my head‚ÄîMIL's behavior is truly not normal. I‚Äôve also recognized my BEC part in the situation. So, here‚Äôs the update and it's long!

My beloved MIL visited us again this month, and for those unfamiliar with our situation, you can check out my previous posts for context. After about two hours of her being at our home‚Äîmostly observing me and LO as she often does‚Äîit all began.

MIL suddenly started saying, ""I don't feel welcome here, so it's better if I leave."" At that moment, I was playing with LO in the playpen on the floor, while MIL stood in the doorway of the living room. Her comment surprised and irritated me, as she had only been with us for less than two hours. I said, ""Okay, yes, I don't know what to say. I'm sorry you don't feel welcome..."" Meanwhile, I was getting angry because I found what she said very strange.

She continued, ""I don‚Äôt want to be in a place where I‚Äôm not welcome. I‚Äôd rather be with people where I feel welcome."" She indicated that if it wasn‚Äôt a good time for us, we should have said so. She then listed various reasons why she felt unwelcome:

The door was open, and no one had greeted her when she arrived.

My DH was working from home and in a meeting, while I was feeding LO. If I stopped, LO wouldn‚Äôt continue eating. DH quickly went to open the door, I think. When MIL entered the kitchen, she said ""hello,"" and I said ""hello"" back while I continued feeding LO. DH was still in his meeting. I asked her how the drive was, and she said the roads were busy. After that, she kept staring at us and asked what LO was eating, and so on.

No one had said to her, ""Glad you're here."" She expected someone to say that to make her feel welcome.

She does a lot for us by always coming to visit, but we don‚Äôt do much for her, such as not visiting her often.

No one had offered her tea or something similar.
DH made her coffee about half an hour later when he came out of his meeting, but I guess that wasn't enough?

I explained why I hadn‚Äôt greeted her immediately: I was feeding LO and couldn‚Äôt just stop. I admitted that I might not have paid enough attention to her, but I emphasized that I did say ""hello"" and asked how her drive was. She said she understood that her son was in a meeting, which made it seem like I was the one who made her feel unwelcome.

When I emphasized again that DH was working and I was busy with LO, she brought up other reasons why she felt unwelcome:

She blamed us for not allowing her to come on Saturday and Sunday, and only welcoming her on Monday. (We had other plans and didn‚Äôt want to sacrifice our weekend.)

She was still upset by my earlier comment that she looked down on me. (At the time, it really felt that way to me.)

She said she was afraid even to make tea at our place.

She had to ""escape"" to the garden because she felt unwelcome and then ended up sweeping our patio. (She always said she enjoyed working in the garden.)

At that point, I was really getting angry. I said she shouldn‚Äôt bring up all these new reasons and blame us for her feeling unwelcome. I said, ""You need to be transparent and say it openly if something is wrong, because then we can talk about it. If I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs bothering you, I can‚Äôt do anything about it.""

She kept repeating, ""I think the best thing is for me to leave."" At that point, DH joined us, and he was also very angry. He said he had taken an hour-long lunch break to spend time with her. I had also spent at least half an hour with her and DH in the living room. We had talked about children or something like that, and DH had said that a friend‚Äôs daughter was a ""little witch"" (the friend had said that herself). Out of nowhere, MIL said, ""So she has a little witch too?"" What the heck? I immediately said, without looking at her, ""LO is not a witch."" DH also said, ""LO is not a witch."" MIL tried to laugh it off by saying that a friend of hers also had a ""little witch"" who later became a very sweet girl, that ""little witches turn into sweet girls"" or something like that.

I also want to add that the first question she asked me was, ""How is it going with work and balancing everything?"" I said that we were still finding our routine, but that work was going well. She said, ""It‚Äôs nice too, isn‚Äôt it, to do something different for a change."" Once again, she was implying that it‚Äôs nice to do something other than always being with LO. This was at least the third time she made this remark. The last time she was here, about a month ago, she said the same thing. I replied, ""I also enjoy being a mother."" She laughed and said, ""Well, that‚Äôs good because you never know what you‚Äôre getting into with a child, right?"" I replied that we consciously chose to become parents and that we were lucky to have a relatively calm child. MIL didn‚Äôt say anything more.

I left her alone with LO twice briefly while LO was in the playpen, as I had to do something in the kitchen. Both times, LO immediately started crying, and the second time, it almost sounded like ""mama."" So I came back, comforted her, and said, ""Mama is here."" MIL just watched and didn‚Äôt say anything. She then asked, ""How‚Äôs it going at daycare?"" I said it was going well, and that LO was starting to get used to the caregiver. MIL asked, ""Is she crying because I‚Äôm a stranger?"" I replied, ""She just wants her mom or dad nearby.""

Meanwhile, LO needed milk, a diaper change, and I had to put her to sleep, all while I was also busy with the laundry. As a result, I hadn‚Äôt made as much time for MIL as she might have expected. I was also tired after a tough week, and since MIL had been with us that day, I had barely sat down for ten minutes.

I told her she had surely seen how busy I was with LO and household tasks. It wasn‚Äôt intentional that I had forgotten to offer her something to drink. She is always free to make tea herself; during her nearly two-week stay in September, she made her own coffee and tea. So I didn‚Äôt understand why she suddenly said she didn‚Äôt dare to now, because she felt unwelcome.

I felt that she was really exaggerating at that moment. DH said multiple times that she should just stay and ""stop making such a fuss over nothing."" It was already around 4 p.m., and she had only been with us for a few hours. He said the drive back home was too long, and he was worried she might get into an accident. Besides, he would be off work in an hour and could spend time with her, and they could go grocery shopping together for dinner. Yet, she kept insisting that she wanted to leave.

I added that I never said she had to leave and that she was welcome in our home, as we had agreed she could visit. It felt like she was trying to guilt-trip us, as if we had to ""beg"" her to stay. In the end, DH suggested that she take a walk to clear her head. She agreed, and she went for a walk for a while.

After MIL returned from her walk, she spent some time in the garden and then sat in the kitchen. She avoided me, but I saw her through the window watching me and LO when I brought LO, who had just woken up from her nap, downstairs.

Meanwhile, I continued to take care of LO, who seemed clearly upset by everything that was going on. DH had finished work and left with MIL to do grocery shopping for dinner. LO was taking a nap by then, so I sat on the couch for a bit to relax.

About 45 minutes later, when they returned, I was playing with LO in the playpen. DH greeted me and started unpacking and putting away the groceries.

Less than ten minutes later, MIL suddenly appeared in the living room doorway, as she had done earlier. She said something like, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve thought about it, and I misjudged the situation. I thought I wasn‚Äôt welcome, but it‚Äôs okay now.‚Äù

I replied that I still needed some time to process everything. Almost immediately, she responded, ‚ÄúThen I‚Äôd better leave.‚Äù That was the moment when I lost my composure. I had politely asked for some time to process what had happened earlier, which I thought was a reasonable request. DH quickly stepped in and said, ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs just asking for some time, so give her a break.‚Äù But MIL continued with her own narrative, emphasizing that she should leave because she didn‚Äôt want to be in a ‚Äúhostile environment‚Äù where she was being ignored.

At that point, my patience ran out. I just needed her to give me some space, but instead, she was making things worse. I told her that I couldn‚Äôt pretend to be nice because that would be hypocritical and that it was normal to ask for time to process her earlier comments. It wasn‚Äôt just about her feeling unwelcome; she had also accused me of other things. How could she expect that just because she was ‚Äúokay‚Äù now, I should forget about everything?

I asked her, ‚ÄúWhat do you mean by a hostile atmosphere? You‚Äôre not even giving me time to process anything. I‚Äôve been busy all day, and you‚Äôre acting like you‚Äôre always the victim. Do you ever reflect on your own behavior? It‚Äôs always our fault or my fault, but you never take any responsibility yourself.‚Äù

I pointed out that DH had been working and I was busy with LO. ‚ÄúWe didn‚Äôt ignore you on purpose; we were just busy,‚Äù I said. She responded by saying she didn‚Äôt want to be a ‚Äúburden‚Äù and that she‚Äôd better leave. DH kept asking her multiple times to stay, saying they could make dinner together and talk things through tomorrow. He also repeated it was too late to drive home.

By then, I was furious and said that she was bringing up all sorts of other things, as if it wasn‚Äôt just about her feeling unwelcome today. She was holding things back and then blindsiding me with a list of accusations. She wasn‚Äôt communicating transparently and couldn‚Äôt honestly tell me what was bothering her. I told her, ‚ÄúIf something is wrong, we can talk about it, but don‚Äôt ambush me with a list of complaints.‚Äù

She then said, ‚ÄúIn the car, I heard that apparently, I stare and have dementia.‚Äù I immediately interrupted her and said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know what was said in the car by DH; that has nothing to do with me.‚Äù It felt like she was trying to pit us against each other.

I reminded her that she had stayed with us for more than 10 days last month and that we had treated her well during that time. ‚ÄúYou made your own tea and coffee then, so what‚Äôs the problem now?‚Äù I asked. She had also said before that we should tell her if it wasn‚Äôt a good time for her to visit, but suddenly we were being blamed for not letting her come over the weekend. She accused us of her doing so much for us while we did little in return. ‚ÄúIf you want us to visit you more often, just say so,‚Äù I told her. ‚ÄúI want that too, but now that we have a child, it‚Äôs harder to make long trips.‚Äù

I also told her that it wasn‚Äôt my fault that we hadn‚Äôt visited her or her family since LO was born. That was because DH, her son, hadn‚Äôt planned anything concrete and didn‚Äôt want to make such a long trip with LO. I said that I was probably being blamed within her family, as if it were my choice. She didn‚Äôt respond, which confirmed to me that her family probably thought it was my fault.

I told her again that she doesn‚Äôt reflect on her own behavior and never sees her role in the situation. She claimed that she had been trying but that for some time now, she didn‚Äôt know how to act or what to say. I told her that she often says things that are really inappropriate.

As an example, I brought up the last time she was here when she said that one day LO would come home from daycare and say, ‚ÄúMama is stupid.‚Äù MIL vehemently denied this and walked toward the kitchen. I got even angrier and said that she had definitely said it, and that it wasn‚Äôt the only time she‚Äôd made such strange remarks. I reminded her of last Christmas when we showed her our wedding album, and after we told her it was an expensive album, she bluntly asked, ‚ÄúWhat are you going to do if your house burns down?‚Äù

She shook her head to deny it again, but I said, ‚ÄúYou did say that. Ask your son; he was there.‚Äù She said, ‚ÄúIf he says so, I‚Äôll believe it.‚Äù That made so mad, and I said in a raised voice (not shouting), ‚ÄúSo if he says it, you believe it, but not if I say it?!‚Äù

I also said that we always do our best to host her when she asks to visit. We‚Äôve never said she wasn‚Äôt welcome for months at a time. I added that some grandparents only see their grandchild once a year, while she visits every month, which we allow because we think it‚Äôs important for her to have a relationship with her grandchild. But if we say that one weekend doesn‚Äôt work and invite her to come during the week instead, she can‚Äôt accept it and we get blamed. I also mentioned that she is always unsure of how to occupy herself and always needs a list of tasks to stay busy, as if she can't keep herself entertained without someone else providing direction.

I added that we don‚Äôt need to be best friends, that I have my own group of friends and she has hers. ‚ÄúFor me, it‚Äôs enough if we can just get along; we don‚Äôt need to be friends.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt use any bad language, but I made it clear how angry I was. In the end, MIL decided to leave, despite DH trying to convince her to stay the night. DH took LO to say goodbye, and MIL kissed LO on the head. I heard DH say, ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt kiss LO.‚Äù This was the second time she had done this, even though, as a doctor, she knows we have a rule that no one is allowed to kiss LO. It felt like a deliberate act of defiance on her part.

After she left, DH assured me that he‚Äôs on my side and that MIL is just behaving strangely and not really listening. He mentioned that during their drive, the first thing she said was, ‚ÄúYou can sell the house; she‚Äôs not happy there,‚Äù referring to me. DH was upset by her comment and expressed his concern that MIL isn‚Äôt thinking clearly. I felt she said this because she gave us money to buy the house we live in (see my 1st post) and feels entitled.

DH suggested that MIL might have dementia, as she tends to repeat herself and forget things. He also told me that MIL won‚Äôt be visiting again this year since we had already given her a chance, and she completely blew it. This was something we had previously agreed upon.

I‚Äôm so relieved that DH finally understands what I‚Äôve been trying to say all these months. He has seen the light, and I hope that MIL won't be able to manipulate him again. I have no desire to see or talk to her for the rest of the year. We‚Äôre visiting his great aunt and uncle next month, and I know MIL will likely ask to join us since it's only a half-hour drive for her. However, DH has assured me that he won‚Äôt allow her to come.

My boyfriend is the most wonderful man I've ever met.  His wife is the most exhausting human beings to ever exist.

We are all adults in our 30s and for reasons they have to stay married.  Until I met ""Anna"" I didnt realize human beings could actually be like this.

In every single situation she sees herself as a victim, and everyone else as bad guys harming her.  To the point that if you tell a funny story that happened before you met her, she will get mad at you for ""excluding her"" by mentioning things that didn't have to do with her.  Its like she expects everyone's life to have started the moment they met Anna and that nothing can happen not in her presence.

She is terrible with any service staff, either sickening sweet or rude as hell.  She's convinced they are out to screw her over and will create these scenarios where she is justified in being mad at them.  Like we placed an order and the second the waiter walked away, Anna started saying how she hopes they don't substitute chicken.  There was zero reason to assume this, but by the time the waiter got back with our food she was snapping at him that he better not have done any substitutions. When there were no substitutions, she was smug that somehow it was because of her attitude.  This is pretty much her normal

We constantly have to be coaxing her emotions and coddling her.  She will pout if asked to do something she doesn't want to do.  If she feels she isn't getting her way, she throws things and slams doors.  If nothing else she bursts into loud tears in public places.  I keep waiting for her to show up in some TikTok Karen video freaking out over some small thing.

My boyfriend has admitted he is constantly anxious over keeping her emotions in check and her happy.

I thought this was just because of the poly situation and my presence was causing these outbursts, but I found out that's not the case.  She has a capital R reputation with people, apparently.  I posted a pic that had us both in it and got two different emails warning me about her from people who didn't know the nature of our relationship.  One was a coworker, the other from a professional who dropped her as a client.  I also found out Anna has a nickname at her local coffee shop because she is such a known problem.

I saw myself going into this as kitchen table poly, but instead I find myself actively avoiding her.  I've started to hope there's a day he leaves her and we can just go live a stress free life.

I dont know if theres a way to fix this.  I've tried offering to pay for therapy but she's convinced she doesn't need it.  Im just exhausted ",25,1728915466.0,polyamory,33,0.86,False

1g3grq9,https://www.reddit.com/r/ireland/comments/1g3grq9/one_for_the_immigrants/,One for the immigrants ,"Hello, a chara

I've been living in Ireland for well over a decade at this stage and have to say I knew from the start I was gonna stay here. Being German myself, there is a of course a few cultural but also non cultural differences that I noticed, some that drive me mad but others I simply could no longer live without.

Given that these are based on my perhaps biased German experience, I'd be very curious to hear from other foreigners, what they noticed during their time here.

As an example:

Things I could no longer live without - An Irish Christmas. I've had German, Spanish, Mexican and British Christmas celebrations but jaysus the Irish just nailed every aspect of how you should spend this time of the year. Be it the, femine-mentality driven portion sizes in terms of food, or the fact that you can start your day with a Bailey's coffee and are blitzed by lunch time, nothing makes me feel more at home then spending Christmas with my Irish friends.


Things I could definitely live without - About 25 percent of Irish drivers. Sure, coming from Germany I will be biased when it comes to this topic but nothing boils my blood more then sitting on the M1, behind some dozer doing 115kph that hasn't checked their mirrors for about 17 miles, not realising the 129 car pile up they've created. Sure this is a thing you encounter almost everywhere but I have never witnessed it as much as I have seen it here.



All in all I absolutely love my life in Ireland,
and surely consider myself more Irish than German these days, for once because I basically spent my entire adult life here but also because the Irish welcomed me into their culture with open arms. There rarely is any gate keeping and if you embrace it, they treat you like one of their own, something illegal be eternally grateful for.
