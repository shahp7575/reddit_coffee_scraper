Picture beaches, palm trees, and all the tropical vibes! 🌴 I just waved goodbye to high school after my A/Ls and I’m super pumped to dive into a 4-year Software Engineering degree at ESOFT Metropolitan University soon. Code and coffee? That’s gonna be my vibe! ☕💻

So, why am I here? I’m on a quest to find my person, you know, someone kind, fun, and totally serious about building a future together, with marriage and all the warm fuzzies in the long run. I’ve never had a boyfriend before (yep, total newbie here!), but I’ve got a good gut for spotting genuine hearts and dodging any sneaky vibes.

A peek at me:

Personality: I’m a sweet, loyal, and funny gal with a big heart. I’m a bit shy IRL, get all jittery on phone calls, and overthink like it’s an Olympic sport. Oh, and I cry at cute dog videos. sue me! 😅 But I’m honest, caring, and always up for a laugh.

Appearance: Rocking long black hair, tan skin, dark brown eyes, and a slim build. I’m 5’5”, 48 kg, and I’ve been told I’ve got that “cute” factor going on. 😉

I’m not here for flings or silly games. I’m dreaming of a real connection with someone who’s ready to be my partner-in-crime for life’s big adventure. Think cozy movie nights, building a future, and maybe even raising a tiny human or two someday!

If you’re a kind, respectful guy between 18-26, whether you’re studying or working, and you’re all about those serious, marriage-minded vibes, slide into my DMs! Tell me your first name, age, what you do, where you’re from (city/country), and toss in a photo so I can put a face to the name. 😄

Psst: This is my second post because I’m determined to find my perfect match! No shade, just good vibes only, please!

Let’s make some magic happen! ✨

Back at the start of high school, I caught feelings for a girl, and over time it turned into full-on love. At that point I hated how I looked (I was overweight), so I never even tried talking to her. In my last year, I got to my ideal weight, worked up some courage, and finally made a move — invited her for coffee. And surprise: she’s a lesbian too. Fast forward, we’ve been best friends for the past 6 months. We both graduated this summer, and now we’re grinding for the uni entrance exams again, so no college yet. I’m still in love with her, but I don’t want to start anything serious before the exam. Should I wait until after and confess, or just keep it at friendship for now? For context: my posture sucks, my fashion sense is trash, I have zero academic achievements (yet), and I still haven’t built the masculine body I want. Basically, I don’t feel like “ideal girlfriend material” at the moment. And yeah, part of me just wants to show up at her door after the exam and yell, “Will you be my girlfriend?!” … but is that even remotely logical? (lmao)",1,1758377168.0,LesbianActually,0,1.0,False

My partner and I are planning a 2-week trip to Vietnam in April 2026.

We’re a couple in our early 30s who love slow travel, wandering lively neighborhoods, enjoying local food and coffee, and soaking up everyday culture instead of rushing through museums or checklists. Comfort and a well-planned route matter to us, but our top priority is authentic scenery, relaxed exploration, and time to just enjoy each place.

We’ll likely book through a local Vietnamese agency so transport and guiding are taken care of.

[**My car battery died, so I walked to the nearest tire place and the most beautiful guy came to help me jump it. He told me to come get the new tires that I desperately need tomorrow. How should I make the first move?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1x1nke/my_car_battery_died_so_i_walked_to_the_nearest/)

So... The title basically says it all! I've been single for a while now as I was taking a break from the dating scene. I'm 22.

I was at lunch with a friend this afternoon. We left after 45 minutes and he drove away before I got into my own car. I turned the key and... Oops! Left the lights on and my battery was dead.

Fortunately there was a Tire Store very near where I was, so I walked there. As I stepped inside and a guy came to see what I needed, I realized he was really cute. I told him my situation and he offered to walk back with me to use the jump box that he had. I happily agreed.

On the way there he started joking with me about a few things and talking about where I went in for lunch. I also told him I needed new tires. When we got to my car he looked at them and said that it most certainly was time to get new ones (I got the car a few months ago, a used 2010 Civic).

The whole time I could see him grinning and looking at me with that certain look in his eyes. I'm an idiot (heh) so I didn't check to see if a ring was on his finger, but with the way he was looking at me I sure don't think he is (if he's a good guy).

After asking me how far my next destination was so that it would be long enough for the battery to charge up, he told me that he would be working all day tomorrow and to come in and he would take care of my tires. ""I'll be there all day"" with a grin on his face.

Okay r/AskMen, this is where I need your help. How should I go about making the first move, assuming that he doesn't? Should I just hand him my number when I'm leaving the place tomorrow? How should I gauge his interest more? I've never really done the ""making the first move"" thing... but I really don't think I'm being crazy with this. Have you ever seen that certain look in someone's eyes? It's so hard for me to explain. I'm certainly confident enough to make the first move, I just have never come across anyone that peaked my interest randomly like he did. What if he's married or has a girlfriend and I am misreading the signs? What if he was just trying to get more business for his company?

Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated.

**edit:** Why the hell did I capitalize Tire Store? LOL. Thanks for the advice, it has really helped! After the tires are done I'm just going to thank him for being so nice and see if he wants to grab some coffee when he is done with his shift (or some other day). I'll go over there after I stop by my school tomorrow (finally getting back into that!) and will update you. Seriously, thanks for being here and for your suggestions! You rock. And /u/vargas .... Let's hope we don't end up in the back of my Civic. Kidding....

It's a coupe, we'll have to use his.

Hahaha. In all seriousness, I'm relationship oriented and am ready to get back into the dating scene after an abusive relationship a few years ago. Life is good, and hell... If I get rejected at least I'll know I made myself vulnerable again, and hopefully will have made his day regardless.

&nbsp;

**COMMENTS FROM OOP**

*He was definitely one of the mechanics. He didn't see me right away and I saw him working on a car before he hustled over. Once I explained the situation he went to the back to grab the box and told the others he was leaving to help me.*

*You know what? You're right :) And if I get rejected... Well, hey, it happens to everyone, and he might just have his day made anyway.*

[**[UPDATE] My car battery died, so I walked to the nearest tire place and the most beautiful guy came to help me jump it. He told me to come get the new tires that I desperately need tomorrow. How should I make the first move?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1x4asi/update_my_car_battery_died_so_i_walked_to_the/) 

I've gotten a bunch of messages and comments for an update, so here it is!

I went into the place and he came to the front almost right away. He grinned and said, ""Welcome back!"" I smiled right back and thanked him again for his help yesterday. He then told me he needed my info and he'd check the battery for me and if I wanted to get an estimate he could get me that as well. So he asked for my full name and after I have it to him I started freaking out a little inside. I have had a hyphenated last name since I was born, my parents never got married. I thought he might think I was married!! I gave him my keys.

Anyway, I was sitting in the lobby for a while. He was pretty busy and would occasionally come to the front to call people who's cars were ready. I have pretty good peripheral vision and could see him looking my way when he did this. Talk about a green light for me.

I need to tell you this: a few times a car needed to be pulled up for another driver. One of his coworkers did these cars. When he was finished up with my car he came in from the side door (still smiling) and said, ""You're all set, I'll pull your car up for you now.""

I walked outside (totally tripped in the doorway by the way, embarrassing much? Hope he didn't see, LOL) and he drove my car up to where I was standing. He got out and stood there for a second. I said ""Thank you so much for all of your help.""

Then, r/AskMen.... then it was time. I had written my phone number down for him. I handed it to him and said, ""Hey, I don't know if you're single (he nodded right here, right away), but here's my number. Give me a call if you'd like to go out for coffee or something sometime."" He blushed hard, smiled even bigger, and said ""I will most definitely do that."" I think he's shy!! It was so cute. He seemed to have a relieved look on his face. So after exchanging goodbyes, I got into my car and drove off.

Okay, here's where it gets funny. I looked in my purse and realized that I had left my phone in the lobby!! When I was at a red light. Oops. So I cursed myself and drove back. He was doing something at the front desk when I walked in and said, ""I totally left my phone. This kind of stuff happens to me all the time! My keys, my phone..."" (it's true). He kept laughing and looked at me as I walked to go and get it.

Well shit you guys. That was a fantastic experience. I really hope he calls soon! For some reason I'm thinking he will... ;)

Thank you guys so much!!! For the support and words of wisdom and funny comments and suggestions. You are all crazy motherfuckers, you know that right?

**edit:** 

Went on a soapbox about my personal life, realized it is not needed. Taken out!

**edit2:** 

Wow... I have no words for how awesome your responses are and how absolutely fantastic I have felt today because of them. You made me smile from ear to ear the whole day. I would marry you all if I could. RIGHT NOW.

Thank you. Seriously.

**COMMENTS FROM OOP**

**AGE:** *Twenty two.*

*Oh my gosh, I think my face was bright red. It was very embarrassing, but definitely hilarious. He just kept laughing at me and said a few things as I was getting it too, but I can't remember what they were!*

[**[UPDATE 2] My car battery died, so I walked to the nearest tire place and the most beautiful guy came to help me jump it. He told me to come get the new tires that I desperately need tomorrow. How should I make the first move?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/1zwez3/update_2_my_car_battery_died_so_i_walked_to_the/) 

Okay, PLOT TWIST! I have a feeling some of you may be disappointed but I am so blissfully happy so I won't even care. :)

Car guy texted me a few days after I gave him my number. I don't know how to explain it, but something felt off about it. Just through the text messaging I got a sense that we weren't compatible. Honestly I'm a little picky and only want the best for myself. Car guy definitely seemed cocky... Don't get me wrong, confidence is great! But humility is also important to me. So we never ended up going out, but it gave me momentum to do something else....

Let's call my really good guy friend Liam. Liam is the one who I went out to lunch with before my car died who left after I found out (my phone was dead or I would have just called him in the first place). If I'm honest with myself I started falling for Liam a while ago, but I truly thought he only thought of me as a friend and nothing more. After giving car guy my number and it not working out, it helped me realize that sometimes I need to be the one to make the first move or be honest about my feelings.

So.... I told him. I told him how whenever I'm with him I feel at home. That his family felt like my own, and that I'd been keeping in my true feelings for him because I was afraid. He looked at me in the same way he always does and kissed me in the most passionate way I've ever known. This was two weeks ago, and it has been an amazing two weeks. All of our friends know that we are starting to see each other, one even said ""Finally!"". Ha ha.

I thought that Liam looked at me like a best friend. We have more in common than you'd think... We're both getting into social work as our careers, and apparently he started falling for me when he first started to get to know me but didn't want to risk telling me and making things awkward. To be honest all of this feels so natural and I can't believe I pushed down my feelings. Making the first move on car guy seriously gave me the momentum to go for what I want. 

I want to thank every single one of you for cheering me on as I went through the whole thing... Obviously it didn't work out but I give YOU GUYS most of the credit for how happy I feel with Liam today. We're just starting out but honestly I can see this lasting a while already. He always treated me so well as a friend and it was SO NICE to be able to get to know someone that way before starting to date. I've been in a few abusive relationships and Liam knows about these, he says that he wants to give me all the love in the world and that I deserve to be so happy, and if he gets to be part of that happiness with me that it would make him the happiest man in the world.

Thank you r/AskMen. I know you wanted a fairy tale story with the car guy but this is reality and what my life looks like. And who knows? Maybe all of this will work out. For now, though? I'm taking it one happy day at a time. :)

# **Update 3 - 1 year 3 months later**

[**[Update 3] My car battery died, so I walked to the nearest tire place and the most beautiful guy came to help me jump it. He told me to come get the new tires that I desperately need tomorrow. How should I make the first move?**](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskMen/comments/3akg31/update_3_my_car_battery_died_so_i_walked_to_the/) 

Hi there!

This is an update to this update.

It's so funny, I was looking up the top posts on r/AskMen and saw my first post right up there. I had completely forgotten about it! I know it's been a long time, but I thought it would be fun to update you.

I'm twenty four now, and ""Liam"" and I have been together for almost a year and a half. We are currently living together in our own place. We went out for dinner last month with some friends, and our friend ""Jack"" asked if we would be engaged by Valentine's Day. Liam did a quick nod but I saw it out of the corner of my eye. So there's that ;)

It's funny how much you change in your early to mid twenties, even in such a short period of time. Looking back on my post feels like an entirely different person wrote it. Liam and I have been so happy and content with our relationship for a while now. He is the love of my life.

AND I'm back in school, we're saving up money and having the time of our lives. I never knew life could be this good, this peaceful, this content, even when everything in life isn't perfect. Having Liam by my side is all I want, and we can figure everything else out as it comes along.

Thank you, r/AskMen.

edit: Thank you for the sweet comments! Yes, it's been closer to a year and a half than a year. Time does fly!

# **Final Update - 2 years later (9 months from the last post)**

An update to this post

Wow. Nine months ago was my last update. Time seriously flies.

I'm not sure if these kinds of posts are allowed anymore, considering the megathread, BUT I wanted to let you all know that Liam and I are now engaged! We're planning on having the wedding in a few years, so I guess that is when I will update you next. I'm twenty-five now, and we want to wait to get married until after we're both done with school. We've been together for over two years now, four by the time we get married. We're talking about children and where we want to live and what we want to do before kids.

Love is real, guys. I never thought that I would feel this happy with somebody. It is absolutely insane.

Be well, my friends. I promise that I will update you after the wedding, maybe even with pictures if that's allowed. Keep on keepin' on ;)

The exhibit is great but y’all, so is the museum.  It’s great.  I watched a movie in the planetarium after that!

I had big plans to get coffee, cinnamon buns, and spend hours at the zoo and garden today but sadly I woke up with a massive headache, got sick, and chose to go home.  The coffee and cinnamon bun recs are good enough on their own to warrant another trip down I think.  And there seemed to be lots of neat small businesses near where I stayed (Aloft).

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

1nlysi4,https://www.reddit.com/r/ibs/comments/1nlysi4/gi_dismissive_dx_with_piibs/,GI Dismissive; DX with PI-IBS,"I have struggled with constipation since childhood.  I typically have a BM every 3-7 days.  I have a few days a month after being constipated, where throughout the day I have several BMs along with nausea and fatigue.  I also have GERD and take Nexium daily.  

**EMERGENT GI ISSUES**

6/25/25 – Became ill in Mexico – Urgent soft stools for several hours – used Pepto Bismol and took a friend’s prescription Lomotil as well as 4mg of Ondansetron as needed.  Symptoms subsided, but appetite was not 100% for several days.  A few days later I contracted an upper respiratory infection which lasted 2 weeks and required Augmentin.

7/19/25 – Woke up coughing due to acid reflux and had several urgent soft stools; took Lomotil and symptoms subsided.  Took 4mg of Ondansetron as needed.

8/10/25 – Woke up coughing due to acid reflux and had several urgent soft stools; took Lomotil for 2 days.  Although stools tapered off, I had 3 additional days of stomach cramping.  Took 4mg of Ondansetron as needed.

9/2/25 – 3 days after finishing Augmentin (for a skin infection) - Woke up coughing due to acid reflux and had several soft, urgent stools; took Lomotil.  Took Lomotil the following 2 days for stomach cramps.  Felt ongoing stomach instability – just not right.  Took 4mg of Ondansetron as needed.

9/6/25 – Had several urgent soft stools – took Lomotil.  BMs subsided, but still had stomach cramps.  Following day also had cramping and took Lomotil.  For the next four days I was EXTREMELY BLOATED, queasy, and had a low appetite.  Took 4mg of Ondansetron as needed.

 9/10/25 – Started taking a probiotic – with Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria.  Discontiued after extreme nausea incident.

9/12/25 – Became EXTREMELY NAUSEOUS and could not eat.  Took 8mg of Ondansetron, which did not help.  Felt extremely weak and was shaking uncontrollably.  Went to the ER on 9/13/25 and was given fluids as well as IV Zofran and Pepcid.  Blood Work, Urinalysis, and CT Scan were all unremarkable, and I was sent home and advised to follow up with GI.  Of note - discovered I had accidentally taken a different Nexium (time-released) than usual for the past 9 days, which is likely why I had worsening acid reflux.

 Up until 9/6/25, I felt “normal” in between episodes – GI followed my typical pattern of constipation, and appetite was fine.  Since 9/6/25, I have felt off.  My appetite has not been normal, I have had nausea, more extreme acid reflux, loud gurgling noises in my stomach as soon as I wake up and throughout the day, bloating after eating, and although I have had episodes of urgent soft stools, I am constipated in between.  There has been no (visible) blood in my stool, or weird color changes.  I do feel a sort of pressure low down, especially when very bloated and/or constipated.  I have also noticed that I am “sighing” or feeling the need to take a deep breath often, especially when acid reflux is worse.  I have been mostly eating a bland diet consisting of small meals of yogurt, baked potatoes, saltine crackers, applesauce, plain chicken, and rice made with chicken broth, and 1 cup of coffee with creamer in the AM.  I would say I am eating between 30% – 50% less than usual, and I am scared to eat “regular” food.  I have lost 5 pounds in the last 2 weeks (I have another 15 to spare!)    I would not say I feel horrible 24/7 - just constantly aware of my digestion, with periods of bloating and discomfort and occasional nausea.  This is all happening as I am about to go to Europe for 2 weeks (stress, I know, is not helping) but GI did ask me to schedule an endoscopy upon my return - I also want a colonoscopy though.  I did Cologuard 2 years ago (negative) so she feels with that result plus clear CT plus good bloodwork it is not NECESSARY - but I feel it is necessary for my piece of mind!  BONUS - my daughter has Crohn's Disease but GI did not seem to think it was relevant.

I’m rewatching the show after a few years, and the age of characters and age gap of certain couples just shocks me so much now. It didn’t bother me at all when I was idk, 16 and watching it for the first time. Then, on my 1st and 2nd rewatch, I remember certain things were weird but nothing much.
Now I’m 27 and HOLY SHIT what the fuck I’ve been practicing a lot of suspension of belief with this show lmaooo

Examples: 

* in my mind, Jenna was as old as Jason, garret, Ian and Melissa. I couldn’t believe when I realized she’s actually in highschool and the same age as the liars. She just looks, dresses and acts so much older than them. 

* (yes yes old topic I know!!!) Ian, Wren, Jason, Ezra, etc, yes it’s all super gross. They’re at least 4 or 5 years older than them. As a teen I didn’t see nothing wrong with it cause I was in a few AGR myself, but now that I’m older and basically their age on the show, it’s just baffling to me how nonchalant they are about dating KIDS.

* detective Wilden is a GROWN ASS MAN lol hooking up with Ashley n shit, he’s a established cop and then detective. Only for us to find out that he’s Cece and Melissa’s age??? what lol that makes no sense. That means Ashley dated a guy like 15 years younger than her, and he dated a girl almost 10 years younger than him (Ali). and I’m sure it’s prob due to bad writing but I wish they had made him older like mid 30s, without him and Alison getting together too cause that was creepy as fuck 

* and poor Alison, was groomed from such a young age, always having grown ass men chasing her. She was 14/15 on the flashbacks I think, and she got together with Ian, wilden, Ezra, that helicopter guy, and I don’t remember who else. It’s so crazy to me that the show acts like that’s… ok and normal. She manipulates people, lies, hides money, secrets, it’s insane to think that she’s a kid. Shes so young and involved in messy situations.

* the liars always acting like adults is soooo funny to me. Going to school with high heels, full face of makeup and elaborate outfits, always having money, gas, car, they go looking for A and clues and snooping around and nobody thinks it’s weird a group of 16/17 year olds doing sketchy shit. To be fair the police thinks it’s weird but that’s kinda their job 😂 weekend getaways, always meeting up for coffee *early* morning before school, or late night for A shit… everything is so grown in this show. It’s weird. Spencer going to Radley is the most accurate thing cause this KID has seen multiple dead bodies, almost got killed a few times, is severely stalked for years, betrayed by people she loved… I’m surprised nobody else crashed out like that (so far, I’m at s4)

* something funny, I just watched an episode with a flashback of Ali and Toby almost kissing, and his mom shows up. Broooo they try to make him look young, with toys and his haircut but I can’t 😭😂 he’s so jacked and big, it looks very odd and out of place lmaooo love him tho

Anyways I think that’s it. I swear every episode I watch I have to hold back from rage posting on this sub. And again I know this has been talked about a ton for years but I guess it’s only now catching up to me… i try to pretend they’re in college but then they go to school and everything is ruined again 😭",1,1758376426.0,PrettyLittleLiars,1,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

I've been to Ireland before, focused mainly on the North, and so we'll probably come back together to do that in the future. Our focus of this trip is going to be nature, pubs, people, and trad music sessions, I have a great Google list of places sourced from here and other Reddit groups for cafes, coffee, trad music, etc. I'm looking for insight, particularly on two aspects. 

#1 We're mostly going to be eating in Cafes and pubs, and trying not to over plan our days, but if we were going to pick maybe two or three nicer restaurants I understand we'll need reservations (which is not something I am used to doing). Based on our itinerary, does anyone have any must visit recommendations that we should prioritize booking ahead? 

#2 We'll be staying 3 nights, 2 full days, in Oughterand in a lovely spot with lots of great nature views. We would like to explore Galway one day, then I'm torn between doing a self-guided tour of the Connemara region, including the national park and just enjoying driving around, or taking a full day tour that will get us to the Aran Islands, show us a view of the Cliffs of Moher and take us through Connemara. If we do that, I almost feel like we should just relocate to Galway, but Oughterand is the one place that we're staying that's more fully in nature. I feel somewhat inclined to limit ourselves to the one guided tour we already have planned for the Gap of Dunloe.

Get Sim cards, and maybe bus card
Lunch
Chester Beatty museum
Pub/Trad music

196X-1970

First things first: Fazbear Entertainment. This company was made somewhere in the 1960’s by a guy named William Afton, a smart guy with somewhat great ideas who was married to a woman named Clara. He also made a pizza place called Fredbear’s Family Dinner about a year later with two characters of his: Fredbear and Bonnie.

Note: From the given information, we can assume that Fredbear was an actual bear due to the fact that that type of entertainment was popularized in that era.

But one day, the dinner started to lose its customers to a different dinner. A dinner called Chica’s Party World, owned by a guy named Henry Emily, who had a daughter named Charlotte Emily.

Note: The reason that there’s no ‘Mrs. Emily’ is because there hasn’t been a mention of her yet. Because of this, we can assume that Henry either adopted Charlotte, or Henry is divorced and won custody of Charlotte.

The reason that C.P.W. was getting more traction was because instead of real animals preforming, Henry had robots. Robots that would wear a costume of Chica. A costume that was made by a costume company – Murray’s Costume Mannor.

The company was owned by a guy named Edwin Murray, who was married to a woman named Fiona. And while all that dinner drama was happening, he was in the background making robots of his own. Making coffee makers that learn your taste, coat hangers that adjust to the size of your coat, and the Roomba… but butler.

Along with making all these machines, he and his wife also made many characters, like: First- Mate Foxy, Roxanne Wolf, Montgomery Gator, Happy Frog, Mr. Hippo, Helpy, and many more.

Note: Happy Frog and Mr. Hippo were part of a group of animatronics called The Mediocre Melodies. They were originally just designed by Fiona, but from the in-game logs, it seems that a guy named Stan had stolen the design, turned them into animatronics, and sold them as seen in Pizzeria Simulator.

But their biggest achievements were the inventions of the Springlock Suits, a suit that can be worn by man and machine, and The Mimic, an endoskeleton that can fit any costume. Though, by at this time, The Mimic was mostly a personal side-project.

A few years later, Fazbear’s & Chica’s merge, though still under the name of Fazbear Entertainment, they make it work. First buying two Springlock Suits from Edwin himself, using them to replace the bear, and teaming up with Edwin to make a sister location called Freddy Fazbear’s Pizza, which would be surprisingly technological for that era having the animatronics move around day and night with the AI of a later time.

Note: Due to the rushed work of making the suit, the suits would stab you from all sides even if you breathe a bit too hard. Please keep this note in mind.

Along with that, William Afton also began to make robots with Henry, making the animatronics for Fazbear’s like a brown Freddy and a blue Bonnie, along with Chica and Foxy.

For everyone, all was well. William had a son named Mike along with another child on the way, Edwin had a son named David, and Henry had good business. It was safe to say that life was good.

Until 1970, Fall Fest.

Note A: There was a fan-theory that stated Fall Fest was a Fazbear event due to it being one in Help Wanted. But since that game was an in-universe VR game made to shine light on the brand, with having lied to the player many times (as told by Tape Girl), we can’t really trust them.

Note B: Edwin actually made some rides that look like they were made for Fall Fest, but they were rushed. Keep this in mind when I tell you what happened next.

Edwin, Fiona, and David were all at Fall Fest having a grand old time. Edwin was happy, seeing his kid laugh, it must’ve been little David’s happiest day. But on that faithful festival – BANG! One of the rides broke and set ablaze. The fire spread across the entire festival, every ride combusting one after the other. Not everyone made it out alive… with Fiona being one of them.

As the sun set and the flames settled, Edwin and David stood there watching the place burn. But now, Fiona wasn’t there with them.",1,1758376230.0,GameTheorists,2,1.0,False

1nlymmn,https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/comments/1nlymmn/replayed_all_4_and_a_shity_review_of_them/,replayed* all 4. and a shity review of them,"over the last month or so, i went back and played each game in order, on nightmare coz why the hell not. and used DA keep to keep the story going.   
  
Origins- still a game that sits in my top 10. best story out of all 4, best main trio but second worse side companions. combat is ok, but it feels in a wired spot of being half turn based and half action. you can ligit just sit the remote down, walk off make a tea or coffee and come back and you could win with the right build. did female warrior human, and ended up as queen with alistair.   
it has its problems. the games economy is nug shit. if you dont use any gold or item dups, you can at best by 1 or 2 of the big items. and it had some odd spikes in how hard it can be. mainly anything to do with mages.  
overall still a great game. a classic of how to set up a world with soild world building and people with few people being black or white with everyone being grey. 9/10

DA2 - allways the Blacksheep. its a ok game, it has it problems. mainly story. it all over the place. hawke, varic are 2 of the best characters in dragon age and i love how the more you pick diolog the more hawke changes, you act like a asshole you become an asshole. male mage hawke will always be the way to go for me. and the look of the Qunari. chefs kiss. they look so good in this game.   
the side companions are hit or miss for me. other then Isobel they kinda feel all one note and locked into the personally they need for the story. they have the parts they are not, but its feels more often then not they are just locked into it.  
overall, its ok. its held up better then what i remember. and its a ok game. 7/10 maybe a 6.5.   
  
Inquisition- for me my favourite game of the lot and another game in my top 10. for me, best combat, supporting cast and a still very good story. it big negative is that is a 10 hour game pulled over 100 with all the side quests and just grinding you need to do to make equipment. for rear i think i spend over 15 hours just farming fade touched items that cant be found from the trials chest. Varic, Solas, Dorian, Bull, Blackwall are all great characters. with Solas and Dorian taking it for me as 2 of the best. with only morrigan and alistair being up there.   
and you can fight more then one dragon and a game with dragon in its name. automatic plus.   
negative wise, the game can feel a bit padded, and the big bad, if you have not played the DLC for 2 they you wont know who he is. but i think that works fine. he is a bit of a let down and could of used more fleshing out in game but eeh, Calpernia and samson are better villain's anyways.   
and the trespasser DLC is amazing.   
overall, one of my favourite games of all time, and still holds up. with the only stain it has it want comes next. 9/10 or 9.5

Vailguard - ok. so, this one is hard. i got in on day one, i have been playing dragon age since origins and since i was 10. i played it for 4 hours and uninstalled once i got past the part with the village and the dragon showing up with the mayor.    
i redownloaded it to replay it. its been 10 months since it came out, lets try it again. i manage to get to where you leave to get the new dude, i forget his name. its after harding gains magic. for some reason.   
in games i normally play as females, unless the story fits a male better (dragon age 2) or the VA is better one the male (vailguard female sounds ASS, sorry to who ever did the VA. you sound like a mix of Irish, Scottish and you are both trying to be a hardass, kind and funny all at once and it does not work)   
i have look up story bits online. (insert tassh comment hear) i really do want to play it and see the shit with Solas as he is the ONLY saving grace this game has. Rook is the worse MC of the 4.  
i dont want to just hate rant. so il give it this. IF vailguard was not a main game, but tagged as a spin off. lets say its a side group built around finding Solas, as a hack and slash. it could be good. but as the follow up to DAI and a list of games built on story, and action / strategy gameplay it does not work. 4/10. yes cant full rait it if i have not fully played it. but very few single player games have made me stop playing and just uninstall. also how the fuck do the qunair look worse in this then origins where they where just tall people. how do you go from the arishok and iron ball to forehead hammer skull. 

i still love dragon age. and will keep going back to play origins and inquisition as I love them. but as far as im concerned. dragon age ended on a cliff-hanger at the end of the trespasser DLC. ",0,1758376033.0,dragonage,3,0.4,False
1nlymlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CampingWithSteve/comments/1nlymlx/here_is_the_purpose_of_life/,here is the purpose of life,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

They are into blinding, strong physical contact with flat instruments in order to cause pain, degradation, extreme forms of mating, odder instruments of pleasure that are banned on multiple planets, punching, kicking, harder biting, cutting of the flesh, applying burning wax to skin, tying their partner down and removing all methods of escape or resistance, flogging, whipping, and so on.” She said, blinking rapidly as she went down the list. Those long nights of research were odd… and rather graphic. “Yes, there is usually a bond of trust in these applications and a phrase used to call it all off, but it can be extremely terrifying for a non-Human of the IDC. It got to the point that a lot of planets *banned* mating with Humans, while others set decrees that anyone of their planetary residency mating with a Human forfeit their legal protections.”

There were quite a few wide eyes around the classroom, staring up at the chart as if it were a radioactive warning label.

“Other portions of Humanity, farther into the red section of the chart, prefer *knife play*, torture, or other forms of extreme pain as foreplay, and that is why you must be careful.” Miss La finished, ending with her hand at the far end of the scale with a flourish. “Kissing is merely the beginning of it all, as Humans are an extremely physical race when it comes to love, romance, and mating. For many Humans, violence, conflict, love, and romance go hand in hand.

“Miss La?” A Pwah interjected, raising his hand and looking both bewildered and worried.

Miss La paused, mid gesture towards the chart. “Yes?”

“Can we wind back to something else Lirya said?” He asked, gesturing towards the white furred Kafya. “Do the Humans really do that tongue thing *in public*?”

Miss La stood there, eyes fixed on the Pwah, then let her arms droop with a slap of palms to thighs.

“Really? That is where you’re hung up?” Miss La asked, her face incredulous.

The Pwah quickly replied. “Just seems kinda gross is all, is that normal?”

Miss La narrowed her eyes at the Pwah, who started to sweat visibly under the gaze, then began tapping at the pad of her thumb with her finger. “Fine, we’ll back this up to Human public displays of affection, and we’ll work our way back down.”



—



 Rhidi’s heel was rapidly bouncing, thumping dully on the deck from her thick paw-boots. 

She was ten minutes early to her date with Morris, and she kept looking around her, seeing if she could smell or see him before he spotted her.

They had agreed to meet at a fantasy-styled bar that was themed after a treasured game of Human history, a classic, online multiplayer game that was based around swords, spells, and a tragic addiction to not showering. It was comfortable, with lower light based off of fake torches and a mostly wooden interior.

Rhidi had been a mess when Morris had asked her to the tavern, standing with her little group of female Kafya and going over stuff with them. She had managed to wrangle all of the female Kafya droppers into one place and aired out things with them, making direct contact and actually taking her role as *Kholihl* seriously.

It had been rather nice until Morris showed up, asking her out to a drink aboard the Moose before they had to set off the following days. Rhidi had locked up, eyes wide and ears erecting while all the female Kafya made a grouped  “oooOOOoooh!” at Rhidi, many of them fanning their faces. Inthur and Pobilo shared a look, while Enflia pointed at Rhidi and went “hah!”, clearly enjoying Rhidi’s discomfort.

The moments after Morris got his answer and left was a blur of wagging tails and high-pitched Kafyan voices, while Rhidi had to quickly excuse herself and sprint back to her barracks room.

She had no idea what to do in terms of how to *prepare* for a date with a Human, so she spent most of the night brushing her tail, going over her face fur with a narrow gaze, and fussing with her ears for far longer than she would have liked.

Rhidi, much like the other Kafya in service to the Humans, had all developed a curl to the tops of their ears. This was due to the long periods of time wearing their helmets, and while the Humans *could* make the ear modules long enough, they refused. 

Long pointed ear outcroppings on helmets were targets, caught on low hanging branches, and brought down combat efficiency. 

This in turn caused the long Kafyan ears to curl forward at the tips, and was starting to become a marker that differentiated a military Kafya from a civilian one.

Rhidi fiddled with the curl on her left ear, trying to see if she could rub it back to form again, and scrambled to her feet when she heard Morris clear his throat behind her.

“Morris!” Rhidi stage shouted, spinning around and placing her hands together in front of her stomach. “Hi!”

Morris smiled, inwardly knowing what was coming. “Hello, Rhidi.”

“Hi, Morris.” Rhidi said, smiling brightly and struggling to keep her tail under control.

“Hello, Rhidi.”

“Hi, Morris.”

Morris just laughed, a sound that Rhidi found comforting, then reached forward and placed his hands around Rhidi’s.

“Hello, Rhidi.” Morris said softly, bringing silence to the yellow Kafya before him.

Rhidi’s heart sped up like the engine of a rally car hitting a straight, and her tail lost all form of decorum, happily wagging back and forth without restraint. 

Morris was wearing a simple outfit, nothing more than jeans, boots, and a clean black shirt, but his smell was there. Rhidi looked down at his hands, then up at his face, breathing in deep and dragging his very essence into her brain.

It was that classic Morris combination of his favored toothpaste, cologne, and that odd smell of old motor oil that would likely never leave his hair, something that Rhidi never found herself tiring of.

“So… drink?” Rhidi said cooly up at Morris, her voice edging nearly to a purr.

Morris grinned down at her, leaning down slightly so their faces weren’t so far apart. “One or two, I think.”

Morris transformed their clasped hands to her hand being in the crook of his arm, escorting her into the tavern styled bar.

The place was warm and inviting, despite the chill of the ship, the ambience achieved through the clever use of a central heating element in the middle of the tavern. Modeled after the forge of a blacksmith, dark iron colored glass acted as coals for a burning yellow center of short flame, heating the room with ease.

Rhidi and Morris found a smaller table designed for two people and sat down, though Rhidi had a bit of fussing with her tail. It took some manoeuvring, but she managed to get it through the open space in the back of the chair.

Rhidi looked around with a bright smile; Fake, or at least she hoped they were, animal heads hung around the room in random places, sharing wall space with leather rucksacks, mining picks, swords, spears, polearms, suits of armor, barrels, all the usual artifacts that would come from the mindset of a fantasy adventure.

The place was rather sparse of customers at the moment, which meant the timely arrival of their Kojynn barmaid.

“Good afternoon.” She said, her mask adorned with the engravings of frothing beersteins and glasses of wine. “My name is Dolphira, welcome to the Quest.”

Rhidi turned her head to observe the Kojynn, and found her rather interesting; Forgoing the usual garments they wore, this Kojynn had instead chosen to wear what appeared to be some kind of barwoman costume, complete with a dark blue skirt, ruffled white shirt, and a light brown apron that came just under her chest.

As per usual, Rhidi found herself undergunned, giving the Kojynn’s ample chest a glare before looking up at her mask.

“Am I to assume your family deals with libations?” Rhidi asked, remembering that the Kojynn did like to dabble in the trade. “Rather interesting place to find work.”

Dolphira shrugged, her digital markers along the mask showing a rather smug, if proud, pattern. “I know my way around the kegs and the bottles, I find it to be fine work. Would you like anything to drink? Kafya normally start with the lighter ales.”

“I’ll have what he’s having.” Rhidi said firmly, nodding towards Morris. “I’m a Dropper, not some civilian straight-ear.”

Dolphira’s readout lights moved slightly, as if showing she was looking at Rhidi’s ears, then back down to her hot ivory eyes. “Very well, and you sir?”

“Pastry stout.” Morris said with a kind smile. “Whichever is sweetest.”

“Very well.” Dolphira said with an incline of her head, and turned on her leather, heavy boot heel, striding towards the bar.

Rhidi watched her go, then noticed the stools. “Oh, they have bar seats.”

“Would you rather sit there?” Morris asked, turning to look over his shoulder at the long row of empty leather bar seats.

Rhidi nodded. “Yeah, my feet may dangle, but at least my tail isn’t trapped.”

Morris chuckled, helped Rhidi out of her chair, and they transferred themselves to the open bar seats.

This of course was a ploy by Rhidi; Here on the bar stools she could sit shoulder to shoulder and thigh to thigh with Morris, and she could press her cheek to his bicep far easier. Dolphira also appeared rather pleased that they chose the bar, her mask emitting light in the same manner.

“Ah, good, I never like when my bar is empty.” Dolphira murmured, her voice coming through clear and without interference.

Rhidi knew then and there that the mask must have been worth a mint.

Setting down the two foaming glass steins of stout, Dolphira placed her lower hands on her hips, and folded her upper arms under her breasts. “So what brings two Droppers into my humble space Squid tavern?”

“We’re on a date!” Rhidi said a little *too* excitedly. She then quickly cleared her throat, picking up the glass stein with her hands and speaking in a more calm tone. “We’re on a date.”

The lights of Dolphira’s mask slowly swiveled towards Morris, who smiled at her kindly.

“A date, you say? How curious.” Dolphira mused, her lights swiveling back towards Rhidi as she took her first gulp of stout.

The taste and thickness hit Rhidi’s tongue like a foreign invader, and it took everything she had to not retch and spit the stuff all over the bar. Her eyes watered, but she did not move the stein away from her lips.

“You okay Rhidi?” Morris asked, picking up his own stein.

Rhidi nodded with a hum of the affirmative, then gathered all the power in her nervous system to give a heavy swallow of the stout in her mouth.

She felt the cold, pressurized burn the entire way down her throat, producing an instant burp that threatened more than just discomfort.

“How is it?” Dolphira asked, leaning forward at the waist. “My family specializes in Human beer now, we are quite proud of it.”

Eyes watering, Rhidi gave her a single thumbs up. “I-It’s good!”

“Good. Drink it all now, it is a shame to waste good stout.” Dolphira mused, turning to point at Morris, who was happily draining his first stein as if it was water.

“Aw man…” Rhidi whispered under her breath, then shook her tail back and forth before once again plugging the stein back to her lips.

While she had greatly enjoyed the taste of margaritas, this was a whole other level of Human alcohol, a thick, creamy, malty monster that tasted a lot like coffee. Rhidi mentally gritted her teeth, and managed to clear the entire stein a few seconds after Morris did.

Morris let out a happy sigh, but Rhidi let out a ragged exhale as if she had been holding her breath. Her spine wanted to wriggle and crawl out of her skin, her stomach gurgling unhappily and wondering just what the hell she had dumped into it.

“That is a mighty fine stout there, miss Dolphira.” Morris said, looking down into the stein. He cut his eyes ever so slightly towards Rhidi with a smile, watching as the yellow furred Kafya held her fist to her lips and let out another wet burp. He remembered she had enjoyed the taste of sour gummy frogs before, so he decided to pivot. “I’m suddenly curious about what else you may have. Do you by chance have sours?”

Dolphira nodded. “We have many sours, though the pucker bear is popular. Apricot and honey.”

“I think we’ll have two of those.” Morris said with a wink, while Rhidi let out a gurgling burp and was fighting the beast she had let into her stomach.

As Dolphira poured the beers, Rhidi looked over to Morris.

“Are those lighter than stouts?” She asked, her stomach finally settling.

Morris nodded. “Lighter, and sweeter.”

“Thank fuck.” Rhidi exhaled, running the back of her pawed hand across her lips. “That was awful!”

Both Morris and Dolphira shared a chuckle, the Kojynn placing two new glass steins of amber colored beer before the two.

Rhidi took a sip of this one and found it to be a bright, crispy, sweet, and sour brew that fit better to her tongue. She took a true, long pull from the stein and smacked her lips, her tail flicking back and forth for this one. 

“That is *awesome*!” Rhidi exclaimed with a smile. “It’s sour like those candies on the Wild Hunt!”

Dolphira’s mask twitched towards Rhidi, her blinking eyes hidden. “Did you say… the *Wild Hunt*?”

Rhidi looked up at her, murmuring “mhm!” around the rim of her stein as she took another drink.

Dolphira felt a crawl of unease wriggle along her nerves; She had watched this woman mow down people live on camera, the feed brought to her by one of the drones that had been orbiting around her. 

She tilted her head at the Kafya, taking her in fully now.

*This is the Kafya that killed over two hundred souls*? Dolphira asked herself, watching as the Kafya bumped her elbow into the Human’s, making him sputter on his beer and laugh. *Her?*

“Do you have any other flavors?” Rhidi asked, setting down her half finished stein. “Anything with a sweeter fruit maybe?”

Dolphira shook herself mentally, placing her finger tips together. “We do, but you should pace yourself, Kafya, there is still food to come and these are Human alcohol portions.”

“Pssh!” Rhidi shushed out, picking her stein back up. “I’m a Dropper! I can handle stuff this size!”

Dolphira pondered that, but shrugged, grabbing a freshly frosted stein from her cooler. “Very well, might I recommend the prickly Paris?”

Despite the vigor that Rhidi was filled with, her liver and blood stream found itself in the same predicament it had during girls night after she had completed her training. Beer, or at least the ones here, were full of fun little bubbles that went straight into her brain, making Rhidi into a giggling mess that was doing a lot of cheek rubbing on Morris’s arm as she laughed at his jokes, stein in hand.

One stout, the apricot sour, and two of the prickly beers appeared to be doing a number on her, something that Morris found terribly cute.

Dolphira kept a curious eye on the pair, knowing who they were, and was still shocked that a pair of people with such blood lust could be so…

They’re cute, right?”

Dolphira looked over her shoulder to Adolgo, a male Kojynn that bore the mask of pans and the wafting air of cooking food.

“I suppose.” Dolphira murmured as she slid her long earlobes over her shoulders, the two masked Kojynn watching the pair as they laughed at each other. “You saw what she did, though.”

Adolgo shrugged. “I know, but I also know it was a great feat of warrior prowess. She is learning to cope as the Humans do.”

“That is what worries me.” Dolphira murmured, taking a pair of plates from another Kojynn behind Adolgo. “A Kafya that can cope like a Human.”

Adolgo tapped a raised finger to his mask. “We cannot speak of that, not here. We still have to wait for the go ahead from Miss La.”

“Why?!” Dolphira snapped, turning to look at Adolgo as she held the hot plates in her two sets of hands. “Why must we wait for the Skalathir? The highest ranking rogue Kafya is here on our ship and *we* know what the Kafya fear to let out, why should we wait?”

Adolgo set two of his hands on Dolphira’s shoulders. “Because she is not the top Kafya *yet*. There is the second rogue with the EUC, another yellow hair, their fate has already been set in motion by Miss La and Mr. Radishow.”

“All this… underhandedness. I don’t like it, Adolgo.” Dolphira grumbled, turning to look at Rhidi as she finished off her sour ale. “Look at her, she is just a young girl.”

Adolgo just chuckled. “That *young girl* butchered over two hundred people and has the Human war religions scouting her. Just give her a good evening with the male, everything else is out of our hands.”

“It *isn’t* out of our hands.” Dolphira growled. “*Everything* is in our hands! We are the ones who found the data-cache, *we* are the ones who smuggled them aboard this Human warship where they are safe!”

Adolgo leaned forward, touching the brow of his mask to Dolphira’s. “In time my love, in time. I’m impressed your English has improved this quickly, by the way.”

Dolphira sniffed from an unseen nose. “You learn quickly from the Squids. Go get the girl some bread! She deserves a free loaf at least!”

“Yes, my love.” Adolgo chuckled, ducking back inside the kitchen as Dolphira swished her way towards the bar, plates of food in hand for Rhidi and Morris.

Rhidi, completely drunk off her tail from the beer, clapped her hands together happily as Dolphira made her way behind the bar. “Yay! Is this the meal set?”

Changing her voice from its angry tone to a more professional, airy tone, Dolphira set the plates down before the two. “Roast beef shank, beets, cabbage, and roasted sweet potatoes for the two love birds.” 

Rhidi grinned up at Morris, her eyes glassy and bright. “Hah, we’re not *birds*, we killed all those during the Ur war!”

“Good grief…” Dolphira whispered from behind her mask as she grabbed the bread from Adolgo, Rhidi and Morris laughing to each other quietly.

Rhidi, well and deep into her cups, ate happily, leaning sideways against Morris as she chewed on her food and spoke quietly to him about their time down on the planet. Morris, buzzed but not nearly as drunk as Rhidi, leaned back against her so she was stable, looking towards her with an easy smile.

Rhidi rambled on as she drunkenly chewed on the bone of her beef shank, her tail swaying back and forth contentedly as she leaned against Morris. More food and beer flowed between the two of them, and time ticked by with calm measure. When she got to the part about how she knew *exactly* how Morris smelled, the Human let out a chuckle.

“Funny, I can always pick your voice out from the crowd.” Morris said in a murmur, polishing off the rest of his other stout.

Rhidi looked up at Morris with a bubbly smile, her drunken face pressed into his arm. “You can? Really?”

“Really.” Morris replied, rubbing his thumb along the bottom of his lip to skim away some beer foam. “Your voice always finds its way to my ear, and I can always find where you are.”

Rhidi glowed, her heart thrumming happily as if it were a guitar in Morris’s hands, and she let out an indulgent, rumbling giggle.

The giggle ended in a hiccup as Rhidi’s brain had enough of these Human beer bubbles, and she promptly passed out, sliding down across Morris's arm and thumped down onto his thighs.

Dolphira was unimpressed, her mask rolling its markers in order to follow her eyes. “She barely finished that second pucker bear, five beers total is a rather meagre showing for a Dropper, I’d think.”

Morris chuckled, taking the moment to lightly brush Rhidi’s hair away from her mouth. “Yes, well, she is lighter than me and I think she is mostly beer at this moment. Mind charging my card?”

“You got it, squire.” Dolphira said, tapping at her data-slate. It let out a quiet ‘yeay verrily!’ as the charge went through, and the Kojynn turned her head back to Rhidi. “Little bottomless pit though, I didn’t think she was going to finish that third loaf of bread.”

Morris looked down at the happily snoozing Rhidi and his face softened in a way that surprised Dolphira. “Yeah… she is full of surprises, this one.”

“Should I fetch a transport for you?” Dolphira asked, waving to other customers as they entered the bar.

Morris smiled at Dolphira with a slight squint of the eye. “And miss out carrying her back to the ship? I think not, barkeep.”

“Go on then, before she blows chunks all over my floor.” Dolphira replied with a fair amount of cheek, waving them off kindly and her mask showing plenty of smile that the free light would never see.

Morris gathered Rhidi up in a princess carry, her face tucked close to his chest as she snoozed in her warm inebriation, and he set off back towards the Wild Hunt. It was peak shopping hours on the Moose, and while many did stare, smile, or talk behind their hands, no one did it openly.

They all knew who was being carried in those arms and to whom those arms belonged, as it was hard not to recognize the Drop Pod Lycan and the Handsome Helsing.

Morris’s nickname was a little more on the nose, as the data-streams and internet thought it would be funny to give him a name based in hunter folklore.

That being said, no one impeded Morris’s path to the Wild Hunt, nor did the Marines on duty bother to check their identification. They instead waved Morris through with a shared chuckle, and warning him to not “wear the Kafya out”.

Morris found that a little out of taste and gave them a fair amount of side eye as he stepped through the gackcan portal. 

As they began to float, Morris looked down at Rhidi as her hair began to drift around her, face serene in her sleep.",2,1758375954.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

However, I didn’t know this fact (maybe I did, just couldn’t accept it). 

I once read a post or comment (whatever, I forgot) saying that real coffee lovers will drink coffee as is and not add milk, sugar or anything. No one even told me anything about being fake, but I was triggered so I ordered a brewed coffee without anything else. I got sent into the ER.

To be fair, it was nighttime, midnight even. I also just finished my duty (on that very ER I was sent to later on). I also drank it in one go. So it wasn’t just the coffee.

Some weeks after, I remembered that post randomly while passing through a coffee shop. Thus, I ordered (I forgot what it was) and even added 1 shot of espresso because why not, I am after all, a real coffee lover. 

While drinking it, I was palpitating, had cold sweats, hand tremors and my head was pounding. Things happened and I was sent to the ER.

Of course I continued drinking coffee. Had a lot of almost ER moments but I learned how to handle it.

By that point, I was convinced that I have a caffeine intake limit. I can only drink some type of caffeinated drinks and I should not drink more than 2 cups in a day. I should also not drink plain coffee. And, I don’t really like anything bitter, including coffee.

However, as a self-proclaimed coffee lover, I had to drink the purest coffee whenever I remember that post. So, I drank 3 cups of plain coffee without really liking the taste and was sent to the ER, again.

1nlycq4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HomePicks/comments/1nlycq4/how_to_choose_the_right_electric_kettle_model/,How to choose the right electric kettle model?,"Hey everyone! I wanted to share my experience and insights about electric kettles since I've been using them for years and recently helped several friends pick the perfect one for their needs.

I remember when I first started looking for an electric kettle - I was overwhelmed by all the options. But after trying different models and doing tons of research, I've figured out what really matters when choosing one.

First things first, capacity is crucial. If you're like me and mainly make tea for yourself, a 1-1.5 liter kettle works great. But if you're brewing for family or office, go for something larger, around 1.7-2 liters.

Temperature control is another game-changer. Basic kettles just boil water, but newer models let you set specific temperatures. This is super important if you're into different types of tea or pour-over coffee - green tea needs cooler water than black tea, for example.

Speaking of features, I recently discovered some amazing options while browsing https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle. The selection there really opened my eyes to what's possible with modern kettles.

Material matters too. Stainless steel is my go-to because it's durable and doesn't affect taste. Glass kettles look cool but can be fragile. Plastic ones are cheaper but might affect water taste and don't last as long.

Auto-shutoff is non-negotiable for safety. Most modern kettles have this, but double-check. Also look for boil-dry protection - it prevents damage if you accidentally turn it on without water.

The base design is worth considering too. 360-degree rotation bases are super convenient - you can grab the kettle from any angle. Also check cord length - you don't want to rearrange your whole counter just to plug it in.

Price range varies widely. You can find basic models for $20, but premium ones with all the bells and whistles can go up to $100+. I found some great deals at https://athometouch.com/electric-kettle when I was comparing prices.

Keep-warm functions are awesome if you frequently go back for second cups. Some models maintain your chosen temperature for up to an hour.

Noise level might not seem important until you've used a really loud kettle! Some models are specifically designed to be quieter, which is great for early mornings or office settings.

Cleaning is another factor people often forget about. Look for kettles with wide openings - they're much easier to clean. Some have removable filters for hard water areas, which is super helpful.

Hope this helps anyone looking to buy an electric kettle! Let me know if you have any questions - I'm always happy to help fellow tea/coffee enthusiasts!",1,1758375321.0,HomePicks,0,1.0,False

Any way, my SUV got ransacked yesterday while I was out for a quick walk with my dog and baby. I obviously forgot to lock my doors after I got my stroller out of the hatch which is 100% my fault - mom brain am I right? 😅 Whoever went through it didn’t take a single thing, but they however, took my two leftover iced coffee cups that had the melted iced and whatever coffee/creamer was left in the bottom and took the lids off and poured it onto my drivers seat. 

The seat is soaked. Specifically the sponge/cushion portion under the leather since it’s perforated to allow for seat heating and air conditioning. I tried to blot as much as possible and wipe with water but unfortunately my vehicle now smells like rotten milk. 

Any suggestions, solutions, products I should try or should I just bite the bullet and fork over the money to get it professionally detailed? 

Also not sure if it’s needed but it’s a Jeep Cherokee if that helps at all… If not please ignore! 😊

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nly8z8,https://www.reddit.com/r/SoundTried/comments/1nly8z8/should_you_choose_the_best_electric_kettle_azeus/,Should You Choose the Best Electric Kettle AZEUS CX-817 Today,"Testing out the AZEUS CX-817 electric kettle has been quite an interesting experience in my daily life. Being someone who relies heavily on a steady supply of tea and coffee throughout my chaotic work-from-home schedule, having a kettle that promises convenience, efficiency, and safety immediately grabbed my attention. The AZEUS CX-817, with its polished design and impressive features, proved to be a solid contender—though there are some quirks to be mindful of.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing I noticed is how aesthetically pleasing this electric kettle is. The combination of borosilicate glass and 304 stainless steel gives it a classy yet modern vibe, blending seamlessly into my kitchen decor regardless of how minimalist it already is. The blue LED lighting when the kettle is in operation adds a nice touch, especially on gloomy mornings when I need something to jolt me awake before the coffee does. The BPA-free materials provide peace of mind; I feel confident knowing that no harmful chemicals will leach into the water. While the kettle feels lightweight at just 2.79 pounds, it doesn’t feel flimsy or cheap—something I’ve experienced with several other similar products.

**Performance**  
Speed is the AZEUS CX-817’s most impressive feature. I can have up to 1.8 liters of boiling water in 6-7 minutes flat—no exaggeration. Whether it’s brewing tea for myself or boiling water for a batch of instant noodles when I’m feeling too lazy to cook, this kettle never lets me down. I’ve even tested how consistent the boiling times are, and it passes every single time, which is great because some kettles I’ve owned would begin to lag after just a few weeks of heavy use.

**Perks**  
- The kettle’s auto shut-off and boil-dry protection features are standout benefits. Having pets and, occasionally, kids running around in the house can be chaos, so knowing the product has safety features makes it all the more reassuring to use.  
- The 360° swivel base has genuinely been a game-changer for me. Whether I’m prepping in the living room or the kitchen, it’s super convenient to place or remove the kettle from any orientation.  
- Another winning feature is how easy it is to clean. With its wide lid opening, I can fit my entire hand inside or use the included brush to get rid of any mineral buildup. I’m meticulous about hygiene, so this has been a massive plus.

[Check AZEUS CX-817 price on Amazon.](https://gogeary.com/p/b07yc2csby/)  

**Negatives Attributes**  
Still, not everything about the AZEUS CX-817 has been smooth sailing.  
- The plastic handle, while sturdy, can get slightly warm to the touch after prolonged use. It’s not scorching or unsafe by any means, but it’s worth noting if you’re someone like me who's prone to distractions.  
- At higher capacities (close to the full 1.8 liters), the lid sometimes lets out small spurts of steam. This hasn’t caused any issues, but it does make me a little cautious when pouring right after boiling.  
- The cord length, measuring 40 inches, could have been a few inches longer. The location of my outlets requires a bit of maneuvering to get it set up the way I’d like.

**Competing Products**  
Comparing this kettle to others on the market like the Mueller Ultra Kettle or the popular COSORI glass kettle, the AZEUS CX-817 holds its own in many ways. Its 1.8-liter capacity is slightly larger than most standard models I’ve tried, adding to its appeal for larger households. However, the Mueller model edges out a bit in terms of faster boiling speed, shaving a minute or two off the time. The COSORI kettle, on the other hand, has a slightly more ergonomic handle, making it easier to pour without a second thought. While COSORI and Mueller focus a little more on heat insulation, AZEUS delivers better visual appeal with its lighting design. Each product appeals to a slightly different user base, yet I’ve been more than happy sticking with this kettle despite the minor hiccups.

**Quality for Price**  
At its price range, the AZEUS CX-817 electric kettle genuinely feels like a worthwhile investment. The build materials indicate durability, and the safety features add a level of sophistication rarely found in some of its cheaper counterparts. While it marginally costs less than some premium alternatives, it doesn’t skimp on essential features or performance. Knowing it also comes with reliable 24/7 customer support and a replacement guarantee sweetens the deal even further. Whether you’re an avid tea drinker, a college student, or part of a large family, this kettle ticks most of the boxes at a reasonable price.

Stuff that’s on my radar from Fragrantica and browsing: Mercedes-Benz Select Night (cardamom + OB + vanilla), Guerlain Spiritueuse Double Vanille (love the natural feel, maybe less creamy), and “Tobacco is my Love Language” (really like that raw-material vibe). I’m also eyeing Rochas Moustache EDP, Lattafa Khamrah Qahwa (Coffee), Mancera Red Tobacco, Essential Parfums Divine Vanille, and Givenchy Gentleman (EDP / Réserve Privée?).

Goal-wise, I basically want to steer the result closer to Les Indémodables Vanille Havane / even Cœur de Oud territory without dropping €300 on a single bottle: https://www.fragrantica.com/perfume/Les-Indemodables/Vanille-Havane-Coeur-de-Oud-96892.html

Priorities: vanilla-forward, deep/spiritual (tobacco/cacao/animalic/musk welcome), good ingredients/absolutes where possible, and something that plays nicely with a tiny swipe of real oud. I don’t want it to turn into a sugar bomb or a woody brick—my oud will supply the wood/smoke.

Layering tips also welcome (order, spray counts). I was thinking oud first (toothpick dab), then 1–2 sprays of the vanilla/amber piece; if I need extra cardamom sparkle, maybe a faint hit of La Nuit somewhere in the opening.

1nly6xv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Constipation/comments/1nly6xv/constipated_for_over_a_month_desperate_for_help/,Constipated for over a month. Desperate for help!,"So I went to the ER last Monday because I had been constipated for almost a MONTH now. They gave me IV fluids and did a CT and didn’t find anything. They told me to take linzess (which I had started taking 4 days before). I have still not gone. 

History:
About 12 years ago I went on methadone which caused me to have severe constipation so I started taking laxatives every night. I became dependent on laxatives and would take more and more of them as they stopped being effective. I got to the point where 2 months ago I was taking 16 extra strength senna a night. This caused me to have severe stomach cramping and diarrhea in the mornings. I never fully emptied. And I would always get diarrhea 24 hours from taking them in the evenings. So if I was out at night it could be extremely uncomfortable and sometimes I would have to take immodium. 

Because of the extreme laxative usage my mobility system has become completely messed up. It doesn’t work at all. I have to massage my belly to go when I even do go. My stomach always feels like an ocean with liquid sloshing around if I push on it. I am always cold and I feel so damn fatigued due to the chronic constipation.

A year ago I got a colonoscopy and endoscopy. I was told I had barrets esophagus. But the GI doctor didn’t help me with the stomach issues. She prescribed linzess however I never started taking it till now (I didn’t want add more prescription meds). She said I had IBS and GERD. She suggested low fodmap diet (which I tried for a while but it was too difficult). She also recommended going to a pelvic floor specialist, which I never did because I was scared.

I am now on only 7 mg of methadone (almost off!!!!) so the opioid constipation shouldn’t be an issue. However I used to take Movantik in the mornings which would produce a BM within 30 minutes but it would give me withdrawal symptoms so I didn’t like it. 

For the past week I have been taking 3 capsules of Mag 07, 145 mg Linzess, and senna tea at night. I did try 6 Mag 07 capsules at night but I just emptied water all night.
I have just cut out the laxatives as they stoped working anyways. I’ve tried enemas, I’ve tried triphala (Ayurvedic) powder tea, I’ve tried miralax, calm powder, everything. I’ve been waking up and drinking coconut probiotic water, taking 5 Dr Ohira probiotics, then I drink black tea. I have either gf oatmeal with Bulgarian yogurt and banana & blackberries or a smoothie with banana, almond milk, peanut butter for breakfast. I drink tons of water and fresh juice during the day and eat apples. For dinner I have a bowl of brown rice & quinoa with kimchi, avocado, sweet potato, chicken breast. I stopped eating big salads because I didn’t want to add more bulk fiber into my stomach on top of everything when I haven’t gone in so long. *The coconut probiotic water (which you’re supposed to take 1-2 tbsp) seems to make me go a tiny bit if I take a huge gulp in the morning. I’m going to buy more and try drinking the entire bottle. But that’s not a long term fix as it’s a damn expensive bottle. 

I do EFT tapping for constipation relief morning and night. I do a simple yoga routine in the morning and evening. I walk my dog twice a day. 

I’m doing everything I can to improve my health. I admit I was not healthy before. I was having an iced coffee and pastry every day around 1 and then would eat a big dinner at a restaurant (very clean high end food) around 7. But some days I wouldn’t eat dinner. I wasn’t wanting to eat when I couldn’t go. So I’ve lost even more weight. I’m naturally skinny but I’m down to less than 110 and I’m 5’6. 

I feel so much shame and guilt regarding al of this. I caused this all to happen by taking laxatives for so long and not taking care of my body. I haven’t dated in 5 years because I have been scared to be intimate when I have these issues. Now over the past 2 months I’ve been getting to know someone and there is the potential to date but I have made it clear I will not sleep with them yet. And that is not only because I want to make sure they prove their worth and mine as well, but also because I’m so damn scared that I will accidentally have an accident during sex! So I think one of the reasons I haven’t gone in over a month is due to extreme stress and anxiety brought on from this potential romance and what it’s doing to my inner turmoil. I’m just so scared to be vulnerable because we have insane chemistry and the thought of having the embarrassment of some kind of stomach issues during an intimate moment makes me increasingly anxious.

I opened my own business back in April and it’s been going really well. It’s definitely had its ups and downs with so much stress. I want to continue to flourish in life but I can’t do that if I can’t even go to the damn bathroom.

I just want to get back to living a normal life and goddamnit I want to have a real poop that is not liquid and that actually empties my bowels.

I do plan on getting a colonic on Monday to see if that will help. Maybe the linzess will take longer to work but it’s been a week. And I guess I will get an RX for the Movantik again to see if that might work, although I don’t think that is the answer because I’m on such a low dose of opioids and I really don’t want to add more meds in.

Oh I forgot to mention, 2 months ago I went off of birth control after 23 years of being on it (12 years without a period). I also went off of my anti depressant and ocd medication. I wanted to see if I could live without being on so many meds. It’s been tough handling highs and lows but I feel I’m doing fine without them. Just worth noting that my body is probably all out of whack because this. 

So I’m begging this community to give me some advice! What can I do to get my stomach emptied? I am desperate to go to the bathroom. Help me get on a routine that will get me flushed out completely then get me going regularly everyday!

1nly17v,https://i.redd.it/fvo71nk3mbqf1.jpeg,It's been one month...,"First off, I will say, I'm a novice espresso consumer at best. 

I researched the Luxe Cafe on and off for about 6 months leading up to my purchase, the idea of making espresso at home had always been interesting to me. I just never pulled the trigger for one reason or another, that is until a month ago.

I came back from a trip to Lithuania and quickly realized that the common coffee in America is complete shit. I think I always knew that, it just hit harder this time around. I wanted to try and replicate the smooth and consistent cappuccinos so readily available in Klaipeda and Vilnius (and I'm assuming everywhere else in Europe).

The machine came, I set it up, and the first thing I made was an espresso martini. This was incredibly easy, and better than I imagined. From opening the box to having a drink, it took about 40 minutes with doing a quick skim of the guide and a good wash down. I'm now enjoying espresso every day in the form of americanos, cappuccinos, lattes, and of course martinis.

This subreddit, along with the espresso subreddit have been incredibly helpful with trouble shooting and inspiration. I'm pulling shots, both doubles and quads, all pretty consistent within 3-5 grams using the Barista Assist. Although I must admit, doubles seem to be the strength of this machine. The Capfei bottomless portafilter is definitely a cool upgrade if you're into that sort of thing. 

I use Illy Classico beans. I know I'll get some flack for that, but I'll take it. There is a local coffee roaster nearby, once I finally make it over there I'm sure I'll never go back.

If I know myself well enough, in a year I'll want to upgrade to an Italian Machine because that's just what I do with my interests and hobbies. In the mean time, I can't recommend the Ninja Luxe enough. It's a great addition to my daily routine, and most importantly I love the coffee that I'm drinking every day.",6,1758374479.0,NinjaLuxeCafe,5,1.0,False

I've wanted an espresso machine for two years now, and I've fallen in love with manual lever machines.
Now its Time! :) cant wait longer

about me: from EU (Germany)
 im simple, i like good coffee but a  good Espresso with only a little milk makes me happy.

 i would only drink coffee at home after work so from monday to friday once a day
and on weekends 2 per day
 every now and then 2 or maximum 3 shots in a row when I have visitors (rather rarely, I think max 4 times per year) but I rely on the French or Aeropress



BUDGET: max [€500], preferably less
 what matters is the result, reliability, and durability. so

Could currently get used:

Rok(from 2015) for €100
Flair 58 (1st Gen) for €450 (maybe €400)
Flair Signature for €170
Superkop for 400€ ( i like the look) 

I like the Cafelat robot more and more. Unfortunately, I can't find a used one near me, so only new [sold out until December :( ]

PS: allready have a grinder (zspresso) that should work for Espresso.


What would you recommend?
From my list or something completely different? (used la pavoni? I like the look)
What will give me long-lasting pleasure and a good espresso right from the start?

Thank you for your time.
I would greatly appreciate any help.

Very prominent figures in the space like Murad are some of those who are very bullish. Q4 literally kicks off in less than 2 weeks and if the experts in the space are correct, then its time to buy your bags.

Personally I have went for Kendu, I have bought a decent size bag now and will be buying whenever I can although it is very hard for a uni student to save up a decent amount of money. I am starting third year university and I am not exactly top of the class so I need to stick in, so that means part time work is fully off the table.

https://reddit.com/link/1nly0y0/video/qn1kfly0mbqf1/player

Kendu is the epitome of a winning community, from the insane extent of IRL efforts(over 20) from energy drinks(just got a new flavour btw), to coffee, to merch, to murals to vending machines....the list goes on. This is literally unmatched and unprecedented efforts, it has not been matched and nothing even comes remotely close to Kendu's IRL catalogue. These efforts alone would be enough to be a very promising project but the fact we combine those with incredible social media efforts particularly on Reddit....Well we are literally winning a battle on 2 fronts and all under 15 million market cap.

Kendu is insanely, insanely undervalued and nothing even remotely comes close to it, we are just gonna get crazier and crazier as the market cap increases and our holders go exponential!

Retail may enter fully in Q4 and if they do **Proof of Humanity** will be something that they look for, gone are the days of people trusting projects due to millions of bad actors, they are gonna look for something real that has IRL backing and something that cannot just disappear. Just this week Kendu Energy which has been around for over a year released a new flavour, this shows how Kendu is constantly expanding and reaching up.

Always look for projects that are changing the game and are trying to revolutionise the space, for example Shib changed the game with their relentless community efforts, just like Doge also changed the game...

**To put it simply, Kendu is this project this cycle, nothing comes close and at this price there is absolutely 0 risk(NFA). Things move fast in crypto and chances are the best performer has not even moved yet. Shib was definitely not the first mover in 2021, but it was the biggest**

1nly0pm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nly0pm,First solo trip!,"I’ve only ever camped a handful of times and never as a child, my parents didn’t like the premise of it. I do absolutely love hiking though. Being in nature is a consistent sanctuary for me. So I decided after a camp trip with a friend to just figure it out and go and start camping solo so I can do large multi-day hikes and just enjoy it to greater extents. I had the most excellent time.

I had the most delicious sandwich while I was sitting in a cave under a small waterfall.

I trekked 27km over 3 days and explored a new part of my country. I met 2 really lovely people at seperate instances and I read my book sitting by the sea at a cafe waiting for the bus to take me home after I’d just feasted on some pastries a coffee and a tea. 

A possum growled so loudly one night is scared the crap out of me. The chefs knife I packed definitely added a lot of comfort (and made cooking so much easier). 

I saw a platypus! It’s is actually quite difficult if you don’t live in very particular areas of Australia. They are always an amazing sight and they only surface when you’re quiet and at dawn and dusk. So while I was sipping my tea looking at some trees I got a neat surprise. 

I definitely learnt to pack a little more and a little different. I’m shocking at dressing correctly for the temperature and I need to improve it. I was so cold it was so difficult to get to sleep - it did go 5 degrees below the expected temp but I also camped on the southern border of Australia (so hella windy from that Antarctic breeze). So solution - check the op shops for  some thermals.

Finding a good bed mat is a priority - I have back problems and that’s an easy comfort I’m willing to splurge on. 

All round: 10/10 excellent time. 🌲

I thought today I’d sit down and make a blog – with all this vlogging stuff I do, blogging can’t be much harder, right!

Let’s talk about Holoport. I’m sure you all have seen it countless times in my vlogs, but I can’t overstate how beautiful this city is!

First off, Nitro state always feels alive, and this is especially true in Holoport. As you walk through the streets, you experience a bit of everything Nitro State offers: neon lights reflecting off wet pavement, street performers showcasing amazing tricks at almost every corner, and, of course, the dragons.

It never gets old knowing Nitro state is one of the main homes to the dragons, especially in times when most states shun them out. It’s amazing to look out the window and see one flying by.

Another thing about Holoport I love is just how it mixes old with new. You have these massive, towering, sleek skyscrapers covered in bright lights right across from the small cafés that smell like heaven. You can just grab a coffee and see the wonders this city has to offer.

And the people here! Holoport’s citizens are… a bit intense, but in the best way! Everyone has their own unique energy that adds to living here. You can just feel it buzzing around the lit-up streets. It's loud, chaotic, and full of surprises – kind of like me, if you think about it long enough.

The city really shines at night. It's like a light show whenever you step outside: neon signs, lit-up bridges, and fog rolling around the streets. The fog can get surprisingly thick here, making me feel at home, as if Spark is sitting next to me.

Everything just comes alive at night and it's a wonderful experience to see the energy this city brings to Nitro State.

So yeah… that’s my take on Holoport! It’s not always perfect, but who is? But for what it has going for it are vibrant colors and excitement around every corner. It’s all home to me. If you ever get the chance to visit, make sure you take your time, look around, and maybe you’ll even run into me!

1nlxxsi,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlxxsi,More Typ 10 goodness.,"Continuing with the Typ 10 for lunch I had the nasi goreng main, apple & cranberry energy bars, cappuccino with an added coffee and sugar and the exotic isotonic drink. 

The cappuccino is about weak on the coffee for me otherwise it's just fine. The added coffee and sugar take it from Geht so to fantastisch. 9/10 for me. So far kopiko cappuccino is my favorite. The exotic flavor isotonic drink is like a fruit punch but not the sickly, sweet kind here in the US. I feel like I taste some passion fruit or maybe guava in it. It has this sour note that makes it delicious. I'll have to look at the ingredients for the flavors. Light orange in color and dissolves well. 9/10 for me as well. 

The energy bars for this ration are cranberry and apple cinnamon. The texture of both are a nice, chewy, soft granola bar. Flavor wise how can you go wrong with either... except maybe for chocolate. A chocolate one would be just a bit higher. Again, these make for a great snack or dessert with coffee at the end of the meal. 9/10 for both. 

I'm very familiar with the Indomie brand instant noodles. It's an Indonesian brand that makes a top tier instant noodle in several different flavors. I was expecting something like that. Instead this was more like a porridge with rice pieces in it. There was this thick, rich, curry broth and I even added a bit more water at the end. There was way more in it than I thought once it was rehydrated, hence the large bowl. I pretty much drank it and used the spoon at the end to leave a happy plate. This has amazing flavor to it. There was such depth to it and in the translated pic you can see the hefty ingredient list. It had the perfect salt level for me. Such a hearty dish. I wish I could find just the main to keep around for the winter. This would be an awesome way to end a cold, winter day. 10/10 for me. ",6,1758374218.0,MRE,1,1.0,False

1nlxwmm,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerInUse/comments/1nlxwmm/should_you_buy_the_best_coffee_maker_ninja_cfp201/,Should You Buy the Best Coffee Maker Ninja CFP201 for Home Use,"The Ninja CFP201 is a coffee maker I genuinely enjoyed putting to the test. As someone who thrives on caffeine to get through busy mornings, I need a machine that offers versatility, speed, and, most importantly, a quality cup of coffee. The Ninja CFP201 delivered on most accounts, though not perfectly. It boldly promises to handle both ground coffee and pods, offers multiple brew styles, and comes with a handful of thoughtful features like a removable water reservoir and adjustable warming plate. After weeks of use (and a lot of caffeine), I’ve uncovered plenty to like and a few things that could use some tweaking.

**Design and Build Quality**  
This coffee maker has an aesthetic that manages to blend sophistication with practicality. Its sleek black finish fits seamlessly into my kitchen, and the structure feels impressively sturdy. Measuring 11.18 inches deep, 9.09 inches wide, and 15.4 inches high, it’s not the most compact machine, so I had to shuffle some other appliances around to accommodate it. Still, that size allows for the 60-ounce water reservoir, which is a game-changer for someone like me who makes multiple cups throughout the day. The reservoir is removable, making it super convenient to carry to the sink and fill without splashing water all over the place. The buttons on the front panel are intuitive, though their labeling could be slightly more noticeable when I’m half-asleep and fumbling for my first coffee at 6 a.m.

**Functionality and Performance**  
As promised, the Ninja CFP201 is compatible with both ground coffee and K-Cup pods, which is great for switching between my premium beans and the pods I keep around for emergency situations. It offers three brew styles: Classic, Rich, and Over Ice. The Rich brew, in particular, lived up to its name by delivering a bold, flavorful cup that didn’t taste watered down. I’ll admit my expectations for the Over Ice feature were low because iced coffees from machines often lose potency, but this one performed surprisingly well. I tested it with pods and ground coffee, and both brewed strong enough to hold their flavor even as the ice melted. 

I was also thrilled with the customization options: 9 sizes for ground coffee (ranging from a single cup to a full 12-cup carafe) and 4 sizes for pods. This makes it adaptable to everything from solo mornings to when the extended family pops over for brunch. The programmable Delay Brew function came in handy several times when I needed coffee ready the second I woke up. Plus, the warming plate kept my coffee hot for nearly four hours without burning it—an unexpected win!  

[Check Ninja CFP201 price on Amazon.](https://maisea.com/p/b08qzxfskp/)

**Highlights**  
- Incredibly versatile with compatibility for both grounds and pods  
- Customization options with 9 grounds sizes and 4 pod sizes  
- Three brew styles, including an excellent Over Ice feature  
- Programmable Delay Brew and Keep Warm settings  
- 60-ounce removable reservoir is convenient to fill and clean  

**Areas for Improvement**  
The machine isn’t perfect, and while most of its features shine, a few elements left me less enthusiastic.  
- A bit bulky for smaller kitchens  
- Sometimes the pod adapter feels finicky—it doesn’t always latch correctly on the first try  
- Cleaning all the components can be tedious after extended use  
- Slightly noisy when brewing larger quantities  

**Competing Brands**  
Comparing the Ninja CFP201 to other coffee makers in its class, like the Keurig K-Elite or Breville Bambino, highlights some of its strengths and weaknesses. The Keurig excels in simplicity and speed but lacks the customizable brew sizes that the Ninja offers. Meanwhile, the Breville Bambino is tailored for espresso lovers and feels more premium in build quality; however, it doesn’t have the same versatility for regular coffee drinkers or iced coffee fans. What makes the Ninja stand out is its dual functionality—it handles pods and grounds equally well without compromising on taste. Still, its bulk and noisiness put it a notch below truly premium options.

**Value for Money**  
Given its ability to tackle regular coffee brewing and pod compatibility, the Ninja CFP201 finds itself in a sweet spot for value. The build quality, feature set, and excellent Over Ice brew are well worth the investment. This isn’t the least expensive coffee maker on the market, but it’s far from the most expensive either. Considering its versatility and performance, it feels like a machine that could fit seamlessly into most households, especially for people who value the flexibility to switch between drip coffee and pods.

My therapist, psychiatrist and I all believe my safest option at the moment is reducing gradually.    
We will be setting up a solid plan in my next appointment but for the time being, what i’ll try to do is:   
  

1. Stick to 10 cigarettes per day (i usually smoke close to 20).  
   
2. Try to break the habit. I changed where i smoke in the house and made it more inconvenient (switched from my room to the balcony),   
and i also separated smoking from having drinks.    
I usually like to drink coffee/matcha etc.. while smoking, which actually allows me to smoke more. So now the rule is: cigarettes on their own. Nothing allowed with it. It’s a lot less enjoyable this way.    
   
I think in the next stage we’ll introduce nicotine patches/gum while reducing the amount of cigarettes, but i’ll wait until i see my doctor to figure out how.    
  
I still struggle some days to stick to the limit, especially when my mood is low. I’ve been trying to use emotion regulation skills, distractions, doing hobbies etc… but sometimes the urge stays there and i’m like fuck it and i have one or two more.   
  
Any tips on how to stick to it and not go up?    

I’ve tried this many times before and have gone down to about 6-8 but every time things get hard it goes back up.      
  
I’d like to hear success stories about doing in this way.

1nlxo0u,https://apps.apple.com/us/app/cisdem-focus/id6445878472?mt=12,5 simple tips to improve focus if you have ADHD,"I’ve been living with ADHD for over five years. There were so many mornings I just sat there, frustrated, crying because I wanted to get things done but my brain wouldn’t cooperate. I’ve tried countless tricks to improve focus, and over time I found some strategies that actually help me get things done. Here’s what works for me:

**1. Pick One Start Time Every Day**

I choose 9 AM as my start time for the day and stick to it every day. ADHD brains work better with routine. I stop wasting energy deciding when to start.

**What I do:**

* Phone on airplane mode 10 minutes before.
* Three alarms: 15 minutes before, 5 minutes before, and start time.
* Bright sticky note on mirror or coffee maker.
* Same start time on weekends.
* Track when I actually start each day for a week.
* Quick 3-minute prep routine.

This routine makes mornings predictable and less chaotic. Even if I sleep in, I do a smaller set of tasks instead of skipping the day.

**2. Use the 2-Minute Rule**

If something takes under 2 minutes, I do it immediately. It stops small tasks from piling up.

**My tricks:**

* Box for quick actions.
* Voice typing for emails.
* Auto-pay bills.
* Quick tasks while waiting or between meetings.
* Handle mail and messages immediately.

This keeps my workspace clear and my mind calm.

**3. Block Distracting Apps**

ADHD brains struggle with willpower, so I block apps and websites during work using this Focus app. I start with 25-minute blocks.

**How I manage it:**

* Use Focus mode or a blocking app in strict mode.
* Block websites too.
* Different setups for different work types.
* Background noise helps.
* Phone in another room or with someone I trust.

Blocking helps me stay focused without constantly fighting impulses.

**4. Break Big Tasks Into Tiny Steps**

ADHD makes big tasks feel impossible. I break large tasks into tiny steps. These small wins keep me motivated.

**I do this by:**

* Writing tasks as one simple action.
* Timer: 10–15 minute sessions.
* Step-by-step lists for big tasks.
* Track small wins.
* Work near others when I need accountability.
* Reward myself after a few small tasks.

This method prevents me from freezing and keeps me moving forward.

**5. Prepare Tomorrow Tonight**

My mornings are chaotic, so I use evenings to make the next day easier.

**I do:**

* Lay out workout clothes.
* Prepare breakfast or grab-and-go food.
* Set coffee maker.
* Vitamins next to water bottle.
* Check weather, set clothes by door.
* Pack lunch and write tomorrow’s main task on sticky note.

This makes mornings smoother and lets me start work without stress.

**My daily routine**

* 8:30 AM – Coffee, no phone.
* 9:00 AM – App blocker on.
* 9:00–9:25 AM – Hardest task first.
* 9:25–9:30 AM – Stretch and drink water.
* 9:30–9:55 AM – Second work session.

Three focused 25-minute sessions make a good day for me.

**Try doing this week yourself**

* Monday: Set start time.
* Tuesday: Apply 2-minute rule.
* Wednesday: Try 25-minute blocked session.
* Thursday: Break a big task into steps.
* Friday: Prepare space and clothes at night.

I focus on one change a day. Even small progress makes a difference. For me, getting a little better every day beats trying to be perfect.",0,1758373494.0,ADHDers,1,0.5,False

obviously, that didn't go super well for me. i came home and tried to sleep, but at first i wasn't tired, and then i *was* tired but my heart was going so fast that i couldn't sleep. i ended up with a heart rate of 112 bpm for a while, and that was pretty scary. luckily, my heart rate is back to normal (about 6 hours from when the abnormal heart rate started). i think it was the caffeine that caused it, since stimulant + stimulant can equal heart issues. also, i'm not hungover at all, so i think if the alcohol had been the problem i would know.

my questions here are: has anyone been through something similar? how did you handle it? can you guys have something like one matcha latte or fancy coffee without going full tachycardic, or have you had to cut caffeine out completely? also, if you had an experience like mine and you can have caffeine safely, is caffeine + alcohol a completely different thing?

If your idea of ""high-stakes gameplay"" is trying to finish a cargo run before you hear footsteps coming down the hall, then you might be in the right place.

We're a small but growing community of gamers, mostly dads, who love Star Citizen but have accepted that our reaction times have been nerfed by sleep deprivation. We've built a casual, no-pressure environment for people who have jobs, families, and other real-life commitments that always take priority.

**Who are we?**

We're an organization and Discord community built on the simple principle that gaming should be a relaxing escape, not another source of stress. We get that you might have to go AFK with zero notice because a kid is awake, the dog just threw up, or your spouse is giving you *the look*. No one will ever give you grief for it here.

**What we do in Star Citizen:**

* **Everything, slowly:** Industrial runs (mining/salvage), bounty hunting, bunkers, exploration, and the occasional ""let's see if we can land three Rocs in a C2 without everything exploding"" shenanigans.
* **Helping New Players:** The 'verse is confusing. We're happy to show you the ropes without any pressure.
* **Group Events (that are 100% optional):** We'll try to get together for things like Jumptown or Xenothreat when it aligns with our schedules, but there are no mandatory ops. Ever.

**Who we're looking for:**

You're probably a great fit if:

* You're a parent or just someone with a busy adult life.
* Your prime gaming hours are late in the evening.
* You want a chill, mature group to hang out with and talk about games, dad jokes, and whatever else comes up.
* You're looking for a group that values teamwork and fun over hardcore min/maxing.

Our Discord server is active for Star Citizen, but we play other games too. It's become a solid place for like-minded people to just connect and decompress.

**Requirements:**

* Be a decent human being. No drama, no toxicity.
* Have a mic for comms.
* Patience. Both for the game and for your fellow org mates who might have just spilled coffee on their keyboard.

If this sounds like your speed, come say hello in our Discord and see if it's a good fit.

Childhood & School:
Growing up, I never had good friends. Until my 11th and 12th, I didn’t really have anyone. In school, there was one girl I was friends with, but she would ditch me whenever she found another group. When they rejected her, she’d come back, and I’d accept her because I didn’t have anyone else. This went on for years.

College (Co-ed, strict rules):
I thought things would change when I got into a co-ed college. I hoped I could finally make guy friends and escape all the drama. But my college was super strict about boys and girls talking, so I barely had any interaction with guys. Again, I ended up with one female friend, who ditched me, then came back when her other group fell apart. Same story.

UG (women’s college):
During engineering, it was worse. I had one close friend for three years. In the last year, she made another friend, and slowly I became the “third person” in the group. I stayed for a while but eventually cut it off. After graduation, I wasn’t in touch with anyone.

PG Studies (co-ed):
Now I’m doing my PG. I thought this would finally be different -chill people, a friend gang, maybe even guy friends. But nope. I’m stuck with one female friend again. She has her own gang outside class (both guys and girls), they hang out, go for coffee/tea, plan stuff together… but never once include me.

How it feels from my side:
I do try. I make conversations, and at first it feels okay. But the moment a third person joins, I become invisible. With guys, it feels even worse. My interactions with men are so limited that I just don’t know how to form any connection.

Now I feel like maybe there’s something really wrong with me. Like my personality is boring or shitty. I feel invisible. I feel like no one really wants me around.

How do I deal with this feeling? Of being invisible, unwanted, and not worth anyone’s time?",3,1758373226.0,AskIndianWomen,15,0.8,False

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **New Orleans Saints vs. Seattle Seahawks: A Tale of Two (Very Different) Teams**

Ladies and gentlemen, gather ‘round for the most statistically compelling mismatch of the season: the New Orleans Saints (0-2, six-game losing streak) traveling to Seattle to face the Seahawks (1-1, fresh off a 31-17 thrashing of the Steelers). If the Saints’ offensive line were a bridge, it’d be the “Bridge to Nowhere” in Alaska—functional in name only. Meanwhile, the Seahawks’ defense is like a pack of caffeinated beagles: relentless, coordinated, and not easily distracted by your emotional baggage.

### Parsing the Odds: Why the Seahawks Are the Statistical Favorite

Let’s start with the numbers. The Saints are listed at **+280** on the moneyline, implying a **26.3% chance** to pull off the upset. Meanwhile, the Seahawks’ **-350** line suggests bookmakers think they’ll win **77.8% of the time**. To put that in perspective, the Saints’ odds are about the same as me correctly guessing your favorite sandwich on the first try (rhetorical question: is it a turkey club? No? How about a ham and Swiss? Still no? *I’m* stunned).

The spread tells a similar story: Seattle is favored by **7.5 points**, a number that feels generous if you’ve seen the Saints’ injury report. Five staff predictions from *Covers.com* all lean Seattle, with scores ranging from 19-13 to 28-17. These aren’t just numbers—they’re a Greek chorus of despair for New Orleans.

### News Digest: Injuries, Momentum, and the Curse of the “12th Man”

The Saints’ woes are well-documented. Their offensive line is so porous, it makes a colander look like a fortress. Quarterback Spencer Rattler has shown flashes of potential but remains the NFL’s version of a “beta tester”—entertaining but unreliable. The defense? They’re generating pressure like a leaky faucet: inconsistently and with minimal impact. Oh, and let’s not forget the Saints have hit the **under** in 11 of their last 20 games. If you’re betting on points, maybe bring a thermos of coffee and a napkin for the long wait.

Seattle, meanwhile, is riding high. Their defense, led by Coach Joe Barry’s “pressure-cooker” scheme, is applying the **49.4% pressure rate** to opposing quarterbacks like a particularly aggressive yoga instructor. Sam Darnold, once the poster boy for “quarterback controversy,” has completed \*\*67.9% o

1nlxjgv,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_tipstor/comments/1nlxjgv/top_5_jungle_trekking_adventures/,Top 5 Jungle Trekking Adventures,"The wild doesn’t beg. It commands attention. Jungle trekking tourism is exploding, wildlife tourism globally valued at about USD 155.59 billion in 2022 and growing at 6.9 percent annually according to Polaris Market Research. Adventurers want eyes on primates, sweat under canopies, taste of earth, roar of rivers. Peru’s foreign tourism climbed 29 percent in 2024 with 3,256,693 arrivals according to the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism via The Rio Times. Costa Rica logged 2,661,488 air arrivals in 2024, up 7.7 percent from the year before according to reporting by CentralAmerica.com. These are not calm returns. They are stampedes toward green.

Deep in the Amazon, Peru’s jungles are raw pages where wildlife plays hide and seek. Guided multi-day treks into Manu or Tambopata typically run USD 800 to USD 1,200 per person for 5-7 days. Monkeys drop through leaf proof, macaws laugh their color, jaguars sometimes show just after sunset if your luck is sharp and light is retreating. Canoe rides on blackwater tributaries cost about USD 150 for a day guide, and nights in jungle lodges spill into dreams of rain.

Borneo’s jungle oozes with orangutans. In Sabah private sanctuaries let you watch those copper beasts swing without fences, raw and curious. Wildlife-spotting tours cost about USD 200-USD 300 per person for 3-day packages. Canopy walks at high platforms in trees cost around USD 50 for access and guide. Rain comes soft, then orders you to move, then stops for no reason, then asks you to jump in rivers and laugh.

Taman Negara in Peninsular Malaysia trades luxury for legacy. Oldest rainforest in the world by some counts, it offers guided night walks where eyes reflect light, and rivers that swallow moonlight. Boat rides upriver cost around USD 70. 3-day jungle huts run USD 150-USD 250 including meals. For those who crave sky, canopy bridges over green abyss deliver vertigo with beauty.

Costa Rica’s Corcovado is where untouched trail means what it says. Rainforest meets Pacific surf, trails muddy with birds with names no one else remembers. Lodging in jungle lodges costs USD 200-USD 300 per night. Guided trail hikes three-day or more run USD 600 and up. Raptors, tapirs, poison dart frogs, and solitude are your company.

Madagascar is a universe mirrored. Rainforests inhabited by lemurs unique to its soil, chameleons that blush like sunrise, plants that pulse in new shapes. Madagascar seeks to hit 1 million visitors by 2028 as its tourism sector grows rich in rarity according to Travel And Tour World. Guided rainforest treks lasting 2-4 days cost USD 400-USD 700, depending on remoteness. Local meals of rice, zebu stew, fruit cost USD 5-USD 15 depending on region.

Best season to traipse through wild green spines is dry season. For Amazon that means May through September. Borneo and Malaysia lean toward February through April. Costa Rica’s best is December through April. Madagascar’s trails open January through March and late August through October. Wet seasons drag you down. Mosquitos are legion. Rain can trap you overnight in huts meant for light showers.

Food and drink seal the deal. Under jungle canopies in Peru fresh ceviche with jungle peppers, roasted plantains, hot coffee strong as regret cost USD 10-USD 20. In Costa Rica stalls sell gallo pinto, fried fish with lime and coconut for USD 8-USD 12. Borneo offers riverbank fish grilled over coals with spicy sambal at USD 15. Madagascar’s street meals of rice and zebu grilled, with sweet wild fruits and iced hibiscus, are USD 4-USD 10 but taste like every sense just got recharged.

Adventure weddings to sweat, taste, fear, beauty. Jungle trek isn’t comfortable. It is immersion. These five top places demand respect, mosquito repellent, steady boots, and appetite. Go somewhere green, go somewhere wild, let the trails break open what you believe you are.

Childhood & School:
Growing up, I never had good friends. Until my 11th and 12th, I didn’t really have anyone. In school, there was one girl I was friends with, but she would ditch me whenever she found another group. When they rejected her, she’d come back, and I’d accept her because I didn’t have anyone else. This went on for years.

College (Co-ed, strict rules):
I thought things would change when I got into a co-ed college. I hoped I could finally make guy friends and escape all the drama. But my college was super strict about boys and girls talking, so I barely had any interaction with guys. Again, I ended up with one female friend, who ditched me, then came back when her other group fell apart. Same story.

UG (women’s college):
During engineering, it was worse. I had one close friend for three years. In the last year, she made another friend, and slowly I became the “third person” in the group. I stayed for a while but eventually cut it off. After graduation, I wasn’t in touch with anyone.

PG Studies (co-ed):
Now I’m doing my PG. I thought this would finally be different -chill people, a friend gang, maybe even guy friends. But nope. I’m stuck with one female friend again. She has her own gang outside class (both guys and girls), they hang out, go for coffee/tea, plan stuff together… but never once include me.

How it feels from my side:
I do try. I make conversations, and at first it feels okay. But the moment a third person joins, I become invisible. With guys, it feels even worse. My interactions with men are so limited that I just don’t know how to form any connection.

Now I feel like maybe there’s something really wrong with me. Like my personality is boring or shitty. I feel invisible. I feel like no one really wants me around.

How do I deal with this feeling? Of being invisible, unwanted, and not worth anyone’s time?",1,1758373128.0,RelationshipIndia,4,1.0,False

1nlxghi,https://www.reddit.com/r/joinmeatthecampfire/comments/1nlxghi/the_watchtower_part_one/,The Watchtower (Part One),"# Part I: The Missing Woman



I’m struggling to find the proper start to this story. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when everything started. Memories aren’t always linear and I can’t help but feel like I’m piecing together a puzzle made of wrong pieces. 

However, this story has to be written. It has to be read. 

If not, I fear that all we went through will be for nothing.

In lieu of finding a beginning, I think it’s fair to say that this story begins at a restaurant called The Red Duck Cafe.

The Red Duck was a dive. 

It survived off of a steady stream of locals with an inclination towards alcoholism. Occasionally a bumbling tourist or a lost stranger would find their way into the dusty old bar, but it was the regulars who kept the lights on and the taps flowing. The only mixed drinks that were served were the kind with the recipe in the title. Tap beer was two dollars at happy hour and the entire place smelt like frying oil and cigarettes. 

It wasn’t the kind of place I frequented, but it was where my newest client had requested we meet at.

It was around seven o’clock when I found myself sitting at a table inside the bar. I waited patiently with a gin and tonic sitting in front of me. I watched the bubbles rise to the surface and pop, thinking about very little at all. The puddle of condensation around the glass grew by the second.

The bartender, an older man with a long beard, was the only other inhabitant of The Red Duck at that time. He stood behind the bar, cleaning the classes, wearing a rather bored expression. In the background an old Johnny Cash song played on the radio. 

When the door opened, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the bar. He glanced around with his hands in his pockets before his eyes fell onto me. He walked up to my table without any hesitation and sat down.

“You must be Alvaro,” I said as I offered my hand.

He shook it, “call me Varo,” he replied with a half-smile. 

His voice was rougher than I expected from a man his age. He couldn’t have been older than thirty-five, but his voice was harsh and weathered like the voice of someone much older and rougher. 

“You’re Harper?” He asked when I failed to introduce myself. 

“That’s me,” I replied.

“Thanks for meeting with me,” Varo said as he stretched slightly. “I know it’s late, I work odd hours,” he explained. As he spoke, I noticed a strange scar across the side of his throat, it was white against his skin. I tried not to stare for too long.

“It’s no problem.”

Afterall, it *was* my job. It wasn’t so unusual to meet at odd hours with clients.

After a few moments, the bartender took Varo’s order and returned with a glass of whiskey. Varo sipped the drink, hesitating to tell me what it was that he was asking me to do.

After a moment of waiting I said, “if you need someone found, you’re going to have to give me a little bit of information.”

“Right,” he nodded quickly, running his hand through his hair. 

He seemed nervous but I had to remind myself that not everyone is used to talking about people disappearing. Sometimes it was hard to talk about.

Varo finally met my eyes and asked, “you like Phoenix?”

I shrugged. So he was a small-talker. Great.

“It’s better than a lot of places,” I said with a tone of passiveness. I didn’t really have much opinions on Phoenix. It was hot. There were lots of old people. What could I really say?

Varo nodded in response and sipped his drink. I hoped that the whiskey might help him get to the point. 

“What kind of cases do you typically work on?” He asked after a moment of pause.

“Minor things mostly,” I admitted. “Cheating wives, husbands with second families, that sort of thing…sometimes I’ll work on a missing persons case, but that’s rare.” Being a private investigator was hardly as glamorous as it seemed on the big screen. 

Varo hesitated for a moment before saying, “have you found anyone? Like someone who went missing?”

I nodded. “Yeah,” I said. “A couple months ago a family hired me to find their son. I found him living with a bunch of other kids at some trap house outside of town. Before that, I was hired to find a man’s wife. She was across the country, living with an ex-boyfriend.”

“How do you find them?”

“Phones, usually. They can be tracked easily, but sometimes people ditch their phones if they don’t want to be found.”

“Then what do you do?”

“If I have access to their personal computer I might be able to narrow down the places they would go. People are pretty predictable for the most part.”

“What if you can’t use their computer?”

“I have my ways,” I said with a forced smile. After years of doing what I did, the idle job-talk was tiring. However, if I wanted Varo’s business, I needed to make him feel comfortable.

Varo didn’t return the smile. Whatever his situation was, he was clearly upset by it. Sweat beaded on his forehead and he continued to tap his fingers against his whiskey glass in a rhythmless tick.

“Most people have a handful of locations that they would consider disappearing to.” I offered. “A vacation spot or a town they lived in before. Like I said, people are predictable. And they’re messy. Usually people slip up by paying for something with a credit card or contacting someone from their old life.”

“What if someone was taken?” There was an intensity to his expression that led me to believe this was no longer a hypothetical.

“It gets more complicated,” I said. “If there’s reason to believe that someone was abducted, usually the police get involved. Sometimes I can help, but ultimately I’m not law enforcement and I have my own restrictions.”

Varo looked genuinely disappointed to hear this explanation.

“But, it doesn’t mean that I can’t help.” I paused for a moment. “Instead of talking in hypotheticals, can you just explain what it is you want me to do?”

He let out a long sigh and scratched the back of his head, nervously. “My sister stopped responding to my calls,” he said so quietly I almost didn’t hear him.

“How long ago?”

“Two days.”

“Could her phone be dead?”

“No, she’s good with her phone. She never lets it die like that.” Varo seemed almost offended that I would ask such a thing.

“What about being out of cell service, she’s not camping or anything, is she?”

The question brought a half-smile to his face. “No, my sister isn’t the outdoor type.”

“Did anything significant happen leading up to her…loss of contact?” I didn’t want to say ‘*disappearance’*. At least not yet.

“She got into a heated argument with my mother. She left that night and I haven’t heard from her since.” There was a clear worry in his eyes, a look I knew all-too-well.

“Are you asking me to find your sister?”

Varo hesitated before saying, “I am.”

“I’ll need some information from you in order to do what I do,” I said. “Let’s start with her name, her address, and a cell phone number.”

I sat with Varo for a few hours at the Red Duck, learning about his sister, Luciana Delgado–who went simply by Lu. She was a liberal arts student studying in Albuquerque. She had a few days off from school, so she went home to visit their mother in Las Cruces. It was shortly after that when she disappeared. 

“Well be in touch,” I said to Varo as we walked out of The Red Duck together.

“When should I expect to hear from you?”

“Research like this usually only takes a day or two. I should be able to track her phone until she lost coverage and hopefully learn more from there. I’ll call you in less than two days.”

He nodded, still looking as nervous as ever. Typically at this point in a meeting, my clients would begin to calm down. Most people found it comforting to pass their stress to me. It was strange that Varo looked just on edge as ever as he walked towards his car. I couldn’t help but wonder if there was something that he wasn’t telling me.

“And Varo,” I called out before he could slip away into the night. “I know it’s hard but if there’s anything you forgot to tell me, please reach out. Even the smallest things can really help.”

“Alright. I’ll…text you if I think of anything.”

I dug into Lu’s case the moment I got home. At first, it seemed like a pretty straight forward case–the kind of case I had worked on many times before. 

From what I found, Lu left Las Cruces, and eventually New Mexico as a whole. Somewhere on the other side of the Texas border, her phone had shut off. However, just before it lost signal, a singular call was made. The call had been made to a local towing company.

It wasn’t hard to find the towing company. It was the only one in a small town called Judgment, Texas. There were no pictures online nor was there an address listed. However, from the looks of Judgment, it wouldn’t be hard to find the towing company.

I walked into The Red Duck only to be met with the familiar smell of stale smoke and spilled beer. The bearded bartender gave me a quick glance before returning to his glass-cleaning.

“Why wouldn’t she have found a charger and recharged her phone by now?” Varo asked as I slipped into the booth seat across from him. 

Once again, we were the only two people in the bar. An old country song played out from the record machine. It sounded distorted and more echo-y than usual–but maybe that was just the empty bar.

“I don’t know but the phone hasn’t been turned on since she called the towing company. I think it would be safe to assume that she had car problems and had to get a tow. Likely, she’s still in Judgment. It’s just a little east of the Texas border. It looks pretty remote, about an hour off the interstate, so it's possible she hasn’t been able to charge her phone.”

Varo gave a short, stiff nod. He looked even more uncomfortable than when I saw him before. He kept spinning his glass of untouched whiskey in a circle on the table. Dark bags were under his eyes and patchy stubble covered his jaw. Clearly, the disappearance of his sister was keeping him up.

“I tried calling the tow company,” I continued. “But the call didn’t go through. The line was busy both times I called.”

“Why the hell would Lu drive an hour off the interstate to a random town,” Varo said. “It doesn’t make sense that she would go that way.”

I gave a small shrug. Lots of family members failed to see the connections. “Maybe she has friends in that direction. Lots of young people go to friends’ houses after an argument with their parents. Do you know her friends?”

“No,” he admitted quietly. “But I think she has friends who live closer than Texas.”

I nodded. “I’ll call the towing company in Judgment once they open again,” I said.

“Thanks,” Varo ran a hand through his hair and glanced around the bar. “But I think I should just go down there myself.”

“Would you like someone to go with you?” I asked

Looking back, I have no idea why I offered that. I wasn’t friends with Varo and I didn’t know his sister personally. Sure, he was paying me, but I was a private investigator, not a bounty hunter. I rarely traveled with clients.

Despite this, there was an odd draw to the town of Judgment. I think I had started to feel this draw the moment I had searched its name. In the moment, however, I told myself I was being a good person–a good samaritan–by helping Varo find his sister.

Upon looking into the towing company Lu had called, I found that there was little information online about Judgment. So little, in fact, that it was boarding on suspicion. Why would a town not be labeled on Google Maps?

“You’re willing to go all the way to Texas?” His eyes met with mine and I knew I couldn’t take back my offer.

“Sure,” I said. “I don’t think I would mind leaving Phoenix for a bit.”

Hearing what I offered, something in Varo’s demeanor shifted and he asked, “I’ll pay for the gas, lodging, and food, if you’d be willing to take your car.”

“That sounds like a deal. I’ve never been to Texas.” Or at least that was what I had thought at the time.

Less than twenty-four hours later, I picked up Varo from a dingy motel on the outskirts of the city. He tossed a black duffle bag into my trunk and climbed into the passenger seat. He rolled down the window the second he sat down. 

I apologized for the lack of AC, and he waved it off, asking if he could light a cigarette. I let him. I had never been a smoker myself but I didn’t mind the smell. Something about it reminded me of a time I couldn’t remember. 

Varo let a cloud of blue smoke out of his mouth as I accelerated into the interstate. According to my GPS, it would take nearly eight hours to reach Judgment. Varo and I had already agreed to take the drive in shifts. I would start us off, leaving Phoenix and heading south towards Tucson.

The radio played a rather mediocre playlist of the top 40s from the early 2000s. I wasn’t really listening to it, but the noise filled the silence between Varo and I. 

I didn’t know Varo well. Outside of discussing his missing sister, we hadn’t spoken much. Taking an eight hour road trip with a stranger wasn't exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I was interested to know about what the tiny town of Judgment held. I hoped we would be returning with Lu by the end of the weekend. 

“What do you expect your sister to say when we find her?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” he blew out another cloud of smoke. It scattered across the dashboard like fog in a valley. “I don’t expect her to be happy with me.”

“It’s none of my business but what was the fight between her and your mother about?”

Varo shrugged. “It could have been anything. My mother is a devout Catholic, my sister is a liberal arts student.” he said.

I smirked. “Has she ever done something like this before?”

    “No,” he said. “She has a good group of friends in Las Cruces from what I hear. She fights with my mother sometimes but she never just leaves. Not like this. And not to a tiny town in Texas.”

I agreed it was odd. From everything he was saying, it didn’t add up. However, I had been investigating for long enough to know that one person’s perspective of something was always limited. There was likely something Varo was missing.

In Tucson, I gave up my position as driver in an attempt to sleep for a bit. Varo took over after we stopped at a truck stop. He drove back onto the interstate, lit a cigarette, and cracked open an energy drink. I gazed out my window at the dark desert skies. 

The mountains around Tucson couldn’t be seen in the dull light, but I was familiar enough with the area to know they were there. 

The interstate was illuminated in a way only an interstate could be. The lights of the cars reflected off of navigational signs and the freshly-painted lines in the road. There was something ethereal about the darkness that enveloped us. Anything or nothing could be out there and we would never see it.

I let my eyes close as I leaned back in my seat. I thought about the map we were following and the little dot which symbolized Judgment. It wasn’t long before a strange dream met me in my sleep.

*I was breathing hard, harder than I ever had in my life. Tears streaked my face and my feet were bloody, but I kept running. I ran across the rough, desert ground until I found pavement.* 

*I wanted to collapse there. Everything hurt. There was so much blood, too much blood. But I had to stay awake. I had to get help. I had to tell someone–anyone–what was happening to me.*

*I limped along the side of the highway, praying to the god that had abandoned me. I prayed for a car–for a savior. I prayed for the blood to stop spilling from my wounds. I prayed for the pain deep inside of me to stop.*

*A bright flash in the distance made my heart leap. Someone was here. Someone was coming towards me. The car approached quickly, sailing through the dark night like a comet through the desert skies.*

*As it approached me, I waved, attempting to flag down the driver. Worried, it would fly past me, I stepped further into the road.* 

*The car didn’t stop until after it collided with my body.*

I woke up with a jump. Varo, who had been fumbling with his lighter, looked over at me. 

“Sorry,” I said, not knowing if I had been having a dream or simply a memory. It was a weird sensation.

“I’m going to pull off at the next gas station,” he said, ignoring my sudden jolt.

“Why? We just left that truck stop.”

“Yeah, like three hours ago. I have to piss.”

*Three hours*. It felt as though I hadn’t been asleep for longer than a few minutes.

I considered that in silence as he veered off the road and up an exit. Varo parked the car beside the building and left in a hurry. I remained seated. I didn’t have to go in and I certainly was in no mood to make small-talk with any other late-night travelers.

Varo walked back outside, pulling the hood of his sweater up over his head. He ducked into the car and backed out. 

“Have you been to Texas before?” I asked. 

“I was born in Texas,” he said without explanation. 

“Really? Why’d you leave?” I said.

He looked surprised by my question. “My family moved,” he said simply. “There’s not much to see where we’re going. Just more desert.” He took a drink from his can.

I nodded, I had assumed as much. “Do you plan on stopping? I don’t mind driving again.”

“I planned to stop in Las Cruces,” he said. “Is that alright?”

“Yeah, that’s perfect. How far are we from there?”

“About an hour.”

“Are you stopping to see your mother?”

“No,” he said quickly. “We’ll fill up and trade places again. I just want to make it to Judgment. I’ll get us a hotel when we arrive there.”

I didn’t argue. It made sense to me. Instead, I glanced out the window and began to wonder about Lu’s strange disappearance near Judgment.

Hours passed, eventually we made it to Las Cruces. Varo pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of town. I got out and stretched while he filled up the old car. I walked into the convenience store and bought myself a cup of coffee. The man at the counter stared at me in a way that made my stomach feel strange.

As I was attempting to swipe my card, he said, “they know you’re comin’. The Primores told them about your return.”

I blinked. “Sorry, what?”

“Ya need to enter your pin,” he said.

“Oh,” I typed in my pin number, grabbed my coffee, and left. 

Despite the warmth of the air outside, there was something cold inside my gut. Something about the strange, nonsensical words from the clerk made me feel ill. For the first time, I began to question what I was doing. I pushed those feelings aside and told myself that I was just tired, that was all. 

I took over for the remainder of the drive. I sipped my coffee, realizing only then how terrible it was. ‘Coffee’ was a pretty strong word for something that tasted like it had been filtered through a dirty sock. 

Beside me, Varo reclined his chair slightly and kicked his heavy boots onto the dashboard. I figured he would fall asleep like that but to my surprise his eyes remained open, focusing on the world outside the car.

For a while I drove in silence, assuming that Varo would eventually fall asleep. 

“How’d you become a PI?” 

“I went to college for criminal justice…I’ve always been interested in that kind of stuff,” I said simply. “After school I decided to pursue a career as a private investigator. Learning the truth about things has always been important to me.” 

I was careful not to elaborate too much. 

He nodded. “Did you study in Arizona?”

“No,” I said. “I actually lived in Denver for a while before I moved to Phoenix.”

“Why did you move?”

I hesitated before saying, “I had an…abnormal childhood. I don’t remember much of it…the doctors say it was amnesia. I moved to Denver as soon as I was old enough to leave foster care. After Denver, I found Phoenix and I guess I’ve been there ever since.”

Varo said nothing for a long time. I wondered if I had over shared. Most people didn’t want to hear about foster care and childhood amnesia. It was really a bit of a mood killer.

“That sounds like a difficult childhood,” he said at last. I could feel his eyes on me as I drove.

“Yeah,” I admitted. It was weird how the night could make you admit things you would never say in the day. “If I couldn’t know the truth about what happened to me, then I wanted to at least help others know the truth.”

“So, you really don’t remember your childhood?”

“Not before the age of about fifteen,” I said. “At first, they told me my memories would resurface, but at this point, it’s been too long. I don’t think I’ll ever remember who I was…where I was raised.” 

Typically, when I thought of the lost time, I felt very little at all. It was so long ago, I often couldn’t bring myself to grieve my memories. However, in the dim light of the car, I felt an unfamiliar pressure behind my eyes. 

It was as if the highway was hypnotizing me to *feel*. I said nothing more about my past to Varo that night. And he didn’t ask anything more.

The sun was just a spark on the eastern horizon by the time we made it to the exit for Judgment. So far, Varo was right about western Texas, there wasn’t much to see. 

For the most part, it looked similarly to eastern New Mexico, an expanse of rugged hills. Small brush covered the ground in many areas, providing cover for all manner of desert wildlife. In the distance, mountains guarded the horizon.

The exit leading off the interstate was hardly an exit at all. The mile-marker sign had been run over. I only knew where to turn off because of the GPS I had programmed with Lu’s last known coordinates.

I followed the directions off the interstate and onto what looked to be a county road. However, much like the exit, it was unmarked. If this was a red flag, I wouldn’t have known it at the time. I was too busy feeling an overwhelming sense of indigestion, or at least that’s what I thought it was. 

My stomach churned as sweat began to drip down my back.

“I…I need to pull over,” I said suddenly.

I swerved onto the shoulder of the road. Before Varo had a chance to respond, I put the car in park and practically launched myself out of my seat. 

I retched on the side of the road, grasping the car’s bumper for support. When I had finished, I found that Varo had gotten out of the car to check on me. He hesitated with a disgusted look on his face.

“What’s wrong?” He asked.

“I…” again, I threw up. 

For once I was thankful for the desolate nature of the desert. No one drove by as the contents of my stomach were emptied onto the dusty road.

Without a word, Varo handed me a napkin. I accepted it with a nod of thanks and cleaned myself up.

“I’ll drive for a little while,” he said as he walked to the driver's side and sat down. “Judgment isn’t far. Do you think you’ll be alright until we stop again?”

“Yeah,” I said as I collapsed into the passenger seat. “That was weird. I’ve never been sick like that from driving–it must have been the food.”

Gas station food didn’t exactly have the best rap. Likely, the burrito I had grabbed from our last stop had gone bad.

Varo pulled the car back onto the road without a word. 

“Sorry about that,” I said. It was hard not to be embarrassed. 

“Don’t be,” he said. “It could be the elevation. Drink some water.”

The elevation didn’t seem like it would have changed much since Las Cruces. If anything, it would have made more sense for it to go down. However, I did as Varo suggested.

“If this town is as small as it seems, we shouldn’t have a problem finding your sister,” I said.

“How small did it say it was?”

“That’s what’s weird…it doesn’t look like there’s a town out here at all. I mean it’s not listed on Google Maps.”

“Then how do you know it’s here?”

I gave a small laugh. “Yellow pages. I looked up the number Lu had called and traced it to a towing company called Judgment Auto and Towing. They had nothing listed online other than their number. So, I ended up searching for anything with the name ‘Judgment’ from around this area, that’s when I found it listed as a town.”

“That’s strange,” he said. His dark eyes were glued to the distant mountain on the horizon. “It must be really small.”

I shrugged. “I guess. Or maybe it’s a bit of a ghost town.”

“It could happen. A lot of towns were built off of mining but when gold couldn’t be found, they sorta just…faded.”

I nodded. I knew all about ghost towns. Anyone who spent any time in the southwestern United States had heard about them. It wasn’t a stretch to say that Judgment was likely dying if not nearly dead. Possibly there weren't even enough people who lived there to warrant listing it as a true town.

“At the very least,” I began. “It will be a place to start.” 

I stared at the dusty landscape and found it hard to think about a young woman willingly staying out there. What was Lu doing in a landscape like this? Would there even be a hotel to stay in?

I wondered about what I would find when we reached Judgment as I gazed out my window. After leaving the interstate, we had been steadily climbing in elevation. We were by no means in the mountains, but the elevation had been increasing slightly throughout the drive. It was possible that Varo was right and my sickness was caused by the climb.

The road was windy, but seemingly for no reason other than to be confusing. It wasn’t long before I found myself disorientated. We were going north? South? I was typically skilled with directions, but the sky had turned a hazy shade of white and I could no longer see the sun.

After about a half hour of driving, I saw a giant rock formation on the horizon. It wasn’t a mountain or a mesa, but rather a large monolith-like structure that rose from the earth like a finger pointed up. It was white instead of the sandy color of the earth. 

I felt an odd sensation in my chest and suddenly, I was overcome with a memory so vivid it felt like it was happening right then and there.

*I saw the light of day, but it was just a sliver of it.* 

*On my hands and knees I crawled toward the narrow exit of the coven. Rocks scraped my bare skin but I was determined to make it out. I had to make it out. Behind me, the cave echoed with a noise that made me sick, a dull clicking sound.*

*I crawled until I could pull myself out of the cave. My knees were bloody and bruised but I pushed on. The hole up ahead was barely large enough for me to fit through. Despite this, I stretched through it, shimmying and crawling like an animal in a trap.* 

*At last, I managed to get free. My palms were slick with blood as I pulled myself out of the hole in the earth and into the scorching bright light of day. A sob overtook me as I collapsed onto the ground.* 

*I gazed up at the giant monument that now towered over me.*

I came back to reality with a jolt, realizing that tears had been streaming down my face. The car was pulled off on the side of the road and Varo was staring at me with a strange expression. Worry creased between his brows as he watched me.

“Are you alright? What the hell happened?” He asked.

“I don’t know,” I said as I breathed heavily. “I had…a memory.” 

I stared ahead at the giant stone monolith that took over the horizon. Deep dread settled in my chest.

“Are you…good?” He raised an eyebrow. 

I must have looked like a mess. A few minutes ago I was puking up my guts on the side of the road, now I was sobbing in the passenger seat. *Some investigator I am*, I thought.

“Yeah,” I said. “I…I think I’ve been here before.”

A dark expression crossed Varo’s face. “If you want, I can turn around and drop you off at the nearest town.”

“No, no,” I said, coming back to reality even further. I shook off the strange sensations. “The nearest town is over an hour away. We’re so close. I…I think I might just be confused.”

With a bit of hesitation, Varo pulled back out onto the county road. I stared ahead.

“What is that thing up there?”

“A rock formation,” Varo said with a dismissive shrug. 

Despite his calm demeanor, I was drawn to his hands. They grasped the steering wheel with intensity. His tan skin looked white from the death-grip he had on the car.

I noticed that the road we were on was headed directly towards the monolithic stone. Varo could have been right. It could have just been a rock formation. However, I had seen Arches National Park and Monument Valley. 

While the giant stone ahead of us could have easily been a similar formation, there were no others around it. It was a lone rock, jutting into the skies. Its white stone looked unnatural against the dusty, tan landscape.

Despite the nausea in my gut and the strange memory I had, I told myself it was nothing. There was no possible way that I had been here before. This was far from where I had been found on the side of the road. I had never set foot in Texas let alone a strange desolate town called Judgment.

* **Channels:** 15,000+ live, 48,000+ VOD (US/UK basics, some CA/FR)
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (evening buffering, especially on live US/UK sports)
* **My experience:** AtlasStream One is my backup for when I just need some background noise—like old US sitcoms or UK news at dinnertime. Not my first pick for major live events, but it gets the job done. Their **iptv reseller** dashboard looked easy to use if you’re into that kind of thing.

# IPTV Thoughts After a Year of Streaming

* **Always try the best iptv trial** before committing—your device, internet, and region can make a big difference.
* Channel numbers look impressive, but most people (myself included) only watch a handful—figure out what matters to you.

* If you become an [**iptv reseller**](https://iptvmeezzy.life/), prepare for tech support questions from everyone you know.
* And yes, a VPN is your friend—keeps things private and sometimes helps with speed.",2,1758372863.0,BeauOfTheFifthColumn,0,1.0,False

I’m struggling to find the proper start to this story. It’s hard to pinpoint exactly when everything started. Memories aren’t always linear and I can’t help but feel like I’m piecing together a puzzle made of wrong pieces. 

However, this story has to be written. It has to be read. 

If not, I fear that all we went through will be for nothing.

In lieu of finding a beginning, I think it’s fair to say that this story begins at a restaurant called The Red Duck Cafe.

The Red Duck was a dive. 

It survived off of a steady stream of locals with an inclination towards alcoholism. Occasionally a bumbling tourist or a lost stranger would find their way into the dusty old bar, but it was the regulars who kept the lights on and the taps flowing. The only mixed drinks that were served were the kind with the recipe in the title. Tap beer was two dollars at happy hour and the entire place smelt like frying oil and cigarettes. 

It wasn’t the kind of place I frequented, but it was where my newest client had requested we meet at.

It was around seven o’clock when I found myself sitting at a table inside the bar. I waited patiently with a gin and tonic sitting in front of me. I watched the bubbles rise to the surface and pop, thinking about very little at all. The puddle of condensation around the glass grew by the second.

The bartender, an older man with a long beard, was the only other inhabitant of The Red Duck at that time. He stood behind the bar, cleaning the classes, wearing a rather bored expression. In the background an old Johnny Cash song played on the radio. 

When the door opened, a tall, dark-haired man walked into the bar. He glanced around with his hands in his pockets before his eyes fell onto me. He walked up to my table without any hesitation and sat down.

“You must be Alvaro,” I said as I offered my hand.

He shook it, “call me Varo,” he replied with a half-smile. 

His voice was rougher than I expected from a man his age. He couldn’t have been older than thirty-five, but his voice was harsh and weathered like the voice of someone much older and rougher. 

“You’re Harper?” He asked when I failed to introduce myself. 

“That’s me,” I replied.

“Thanks for meeting with me,” Varo said as he stretched slightly. “I know it’s late, I work odd hours,” he explained. As he spoke, I noticed a strange scar across the side of his throat, it was white against his skin. I tried not to stare for too long.

“It’s no problem.”

Afterall, it *was* my job. It wasn’t so unusual to meet at odd hours with clients.

After a few moments, the bartender took Varo’s order and returned with a glass of whiskey. Varo sipped the drink, hesitating to tell me what it was that he was asking me to do.

After a moment of waiting I said, “if you need someone found, you’re going to have to give me a little bit of information.”

“Right,” he nodded quickly, running his hand through his hair. 

He seemed nervous but I had to remind myself that not everyone is used to talking about people disappearing. Sometimes it was hard to talk about.

Varo finally met my eyes and asked, “you like Phoenix?”

I shrugged. So he was a small-talker. Great.

“It’s better than a lot of places,” I said with a tone of passiveness. I didn’t really have much opinions on Phoenix. It was hot. There were lots of old people. What could I really say?

Varo nodded in response and sipped his drink. I hoped that the whiskey might help him get to the point. 

“What kind of cases do you typically work on?” He asked after a moment of pause.

“Minor things mostly,” I admitted. “Cheating wives, husbands with second families, that sort of thing…sometimes I’ll work on a missing persons case, but that’s rare.” Being a private investigator was hardly as glamorous as it seemed on the big screen. 

Varo hesitated for a moment before saying, “have you found anyone? Like someone who went missing?”

I nodded. “Yeah,” I said. “A couple months ago a family hired me to find their son. I found him living with a bunch of other kids at some trap house outside of town. Before that, I was hired to find a man’s wife. She was across the country, living with an ex-boyfriend.”

“How do you find them?”

“Phones, usually. They can be tracked easily, but sometimes people ditch their phones if they don’t want to be found.”

“Then what do you do?”

“If I have access to their personal computer I might be able to narrow down the places they would go. People are pretty predictable for the most part.”

“What if you can’t use their computer?”

“I have my ways,” I said with a forced smile. After years of doing what I did, the idle job-talk was tiring. However, if I wanted Varo’s business, I needed to make him feel comfortable.

Varo didn’t return the smile. Whatever his situation was, he was clearly upset by it. Sweat beaded on his forehead and he continued to tap his fingers against his whiskey glass in a rhythmless tick.

“Most people have a handful of locations that they would consider disappearing to.” I offered. “A vacation spot or a town they lived in before. Like I said, people are predictable. And they’re messy. Usually people slip up by paying for something with a credit card or contacting someone from their old life.”

“What if someone was taken?” There was an intensity to his expression that led me to believe this was no longer a hypothetical.

“It gets more complicated,” I said. “If there’s reason to believe that someone was abducted, usually the police get involved. Sometimes I can help, but ultimately I’m not law enforcement and I have my own restrictions.”

Varo looked genuinely disappointed to hear this explanation.

“But, it doesn’t mean that I can’t help.” I paused for a moment. “Instead of talking in hypotheticals, can you just explain what it is you want me to do?”

He let out a long sigh and scratched the back of his head, nervously. “My sister stopped responding to my calls,” he said so quietly I almost didn’t hear him.

“How long ago?”

“Two days.”

“Could her phone be dead?”

“No, she’s good with her phone. She never lets it die like that.” Varo seemed almost offended that I would ask such a thing.

“What about being out of cell service, she’s not camping or anything, is she?”

The question brought a half-smile to his face. “No, my sister isn’t the outdoor type.”

“Did anything significant happen leading up to her…loss of contact?” I didn’t want to say ‘*disappearance’*. At least not yet.

“She got into a heated argument with my mother. She left that night and I haven’t heard from her since.” There was a clear worry in his eyes, a look I knew all-too-well.

“Are you asking me to find your sister?”

Varo hesitated before saying, “I am.”

“I’ll need some information from you in order to do what I do,” I said. “Let’s start with her name, her address, and a cell phone number.”

I sat with Varo for a few hours at the Red Duck, learning about his sister, Luciana Delgado–who went simply by Lu. She was a liberal arts student studying in Albuquerque. She had a few days off from school, so she went home to visit their mother in Las Cruces. It was shortly after that when she disappeared. 

“Well be in touch,” I said to Varo as we walked out of The Red Duck together.

“When should I expect to hear from you?”

“Research like this usually only takes a day or two. I should be able to track her phone until she lost coverage and hopefully learn more from there. I’ll call you in less than two days.”

He nodded, still looking as nervous as ever. Typically at this point in a meeting, my clients would begin to calm down. Most people found it comforting to pass their stress to me. It was strange that Varo looked just on edge as ever as he walked towards his car. I couldn’t help but wonder if there was something that he wasn’t telling me.

“And Varo,” I called out before he could slip away into the night. “I know it’s hard but if there’s anything you forgot to tell me, please reach out. Even the smallest things can really help.”

“Alright. I’ll…text you if I think of anything.”

I dug into Lu’s case the moment I got home. At first, it seemed like a pretty straight forward case–the kind of case I had worked on many times before. 

From what I found, Lu left Las Cruces, and eventually New Mexico as a whole. Somewhere on the other side of the Texas border, her phone had shut off. However, just before it lost signal, a singular call was made. The call had been made to a local towing company.

It wasn’t hard to find the towing company. It was the only one in a small town called Judgment, Texas. There were no pictures online nor was there an address listed. However, from the looks of Judgment, it wouldn’t be hard to find the towing company.

I walked into The Red Duck only to be met with the familiar smell of stale smoke and spilled beer. The bearded bartender gave me a quick glance before returning to his glass-cleaning.

“Why wouldn’t she have found a charger and recharged her phone by now?” Varo asked as I slipped into the booth seat across from him. 

Once again, we were the only two people in the bar. An old country song played out from the record machine. It sounded distorted and more echo-y than usual–but maybe that was just the empty bar.

“I don’t know but the phone hasn’t been turned on since she called the towing company. I think it would be safe to assume that she had car problems and had to get a tow. Likely, she’s still in Judgment. It’s just a little east of the Texas border. It looks pretty remote, about an hour off the interstate, so it's possible she hasn’t been able to charge her phone.”

Varo gave a short, stiff nod. He looked even more uncomfortable than when I saw him before. He kept spinning his glass of untouched whiskey in a circle on the table. Dark bags were under his eyes and patchy stubble covered his jaw. Clearly, the disappearance of his sister was keeping him up.

“I tried calling the tow company,” I continued. “But the call didn’t go through. The line was busy both times I called.”

“Why the hell would Lu drive an hour off the interstate to a random town,” Varo said. “It doesn’t make sense that she would go that way.”

I gave a small shrug. Lots of family members failed to see the connections. “Maybe she has friends in that direction. Lots of young people go to friends’ houses after an argument with their parents. Do you know her friends?”

“No,” he admitted quietly. “But I think she has friends who live closer than Texas.”

I nodded. “I’ll call the towing company in Judgment once they open again,” I said.

“Thanks,” Varo ran a hand through his hair and glanced around the bar. “But I think I should just go down there myself.”

“Would you like someone to go with you?” I asked

Looking back, I have no idea why I offered that. I wasn’t friends with Varo and I didn’t know his sister personally. Sure, he was paying me, but I was a private investigator, not a bounty hunter. I rarely traveled with clients.

Despite this, there was an odd draw to the town of Judgment. I think I had started to feel this draw the moment I had searched its name. In the moment, however, I told myself I was being a good person–a good samaritan–by helping Varo find his sister.

Upon looking into the towing company Lu had called, I found that there was little information online about Judgment. So little, in fact, that it was boarding on suspicion. Why would a town not be labeled on Google Maps?

“You’re willing to go all the way to Texas?” His eyes met with mine and I knew I couldn’t take back my offer.

“Sure,” I said. “I don’t think I would mind leaving Phoenix for a bit.”

Hearing what I offered, something in Varo’s demeanor shifted and he asked, “I’ll pay for the gas, lodging, and food, if you’d be willing to take your car.”

“That sounds like a deal. I’ve never been to Texas.” Or at least that was what I had thought at the time.

Less than twenty-four hours later, I picked up Varo from a dingy motel on the outskirts of the city. He tossed a black duffle bag into my trunk and climbed into the passenger seat. He rolled down the window the second he sat down. 

I apologized for the lack of AC, and he waved it off, asking if he could light a cigarette. I let him. I had never been a smoker myself but I didn’t mind the smell. Something about it reminded me of a time I couldn’t remember. 

Varo let a cloud of blue smoke out of his mouth as I accelerated into the interstate. According to my GPS, it would take nearly eight hours to reach Judgment. Varo and I had already agreed to take the drive in shifts. I would start us off, leaving Phoenix and heading south towards Tucson.

The radio played a rather mediocre playlist of the top 40s from the early 2000s. I wasn’t really listening to it, but the noise filled the silence between Varo and I. 

I didn’t know Varo well. Outside of discussing his missing sister, we hadn’t spoken much. Taking an eight hour road trip with a stranger wasn't exactly how I planned to spend my weekend, but I was interested to know about what the tiny town of Judgment held. I hoped we would be returning with Lu by the end of the weekend. 

“What do you expect your sister to say when we find her?” I asked.

“I don’t know,” he blew out another cloud of smoke. It scattered across the dashboard like fog in a valley. “I don’t expect her to be happy with me.”

“It’s none of my business but what was the fight between her and your mother about?”

Varo shrugged. “It could have been anything. My mother is a devout Catholic, my sister is a liberal arts student.” he said.

I smirked. “Has she ever done something like this before?”

    “No,” he said. “She has a good group of friends in Las Cruces from what I hear. She fights with my mother sometimes but she never just leaves. Not like this. And not to a tiny town in Texas.”

I agreed it was odd. From everything he was saying, it didn’t add up. However, I had been investigating for long enough to know that one person’s perspective of something was always limited. There was likely something Varo was missing.

In Tucson, I gave up my position as driver in an attempt to sleep for a bit. Varo took over after we stopped at a truck stop. He drove back onto the interstate, lit a cigarette, and cracked open an energy drink. I gazed out my window at the dark desert skies. 

The mountains around Tucson couldn’t be seen in the dull light, but I was familiar enough with the area to know they were there. 

The interstate was illuminated in a way only an interstate could be. The lights of the cars reflected off of navigational signs and the freshly-painted lines in the road. There was something ethereal about the darkness that enveloped us. Anything or nothing could be out there and we would never see it.

I let my eyes close as I leaned back in my seat. I thought about the map we were following and the little dot which symbolized Judgment. It wasn’t long before a strange dream met me in my sleep.

*I was breathing hard, harder than I ever had in my life. Tears streaked my face and my feet were bloody, but I kept running. I ran across the rough, desert ground until I found pavement.* 

*I wanted to collapse there. Everything hurt. There was so much blood, too much blood. But I had to stay awake. I had to get help. I had to tell someone–anyone–what was happening to me.*

*I limped along the side of the highway, praying to the god that had abandoned me. I prayed for a car–for a savior. I prayed for the blood to stop spilling from my wounds. I prayed for the pain deep inside of me to stop.*

*A bright flash in the distance made my heart leap. Someone was here. Someone was coming towards me. The car approached quickly, sailing through the dark night like a comet through the desert skies.*

*As it approached me, I waved, attempting to flag down the driver. Worried, it would fly past me, I stepped further into the road.* 

*The car didn’t stop until after it collided with my body.*

I woke up with a jump. Varo, who had been fumbling with his lighter, looked over at me. 

“Sorry,” I said, not knowing if I had been having a dream or simply a memory. It was a weird sensation.

“I’m going to pull off at the next gas station,” he said, ignoring my sudden jolt.

“Why? We just left that truck stop.”

“Yeah, like three hours ago. I have to piss.”

*Three hours*. It felt as though I hadn’t been asleep for longer than a few minutes.

I considered that in silence as he veered off the road and up an exit. Varo parked the car beside the building and left in a hurry. I remained seated. I didn’t have to go in and I certainly was in no mood to make small-talk with any other late-night travelers.

Varo walked back outside, pulling the hood of his sweater up over his head. He ducked into the car and backed out. 

“Have you been to Texas before?” I asked. 

“I was born in Texas,” he said without explanation. 

“Really? Why’d you leave?” I said.

He looked surprised by my question. “My family moved,” he said simply. “There’s not much to see where we’re going. Just more desert.” He took a drink from his can.

I nodded, I had assumed as much. “Do you plan on stopping? I don’t mind driving again.”

“I planned to stop in Las Cruces,” he said. “Is that alright?”

“Yeah, that’s perfect. How far are we from there?”

“About an hour.”

“Are you stopping to see your mother?”

“No,” he said quickly. “We’ll fill up and trade places again. I just want to make it to Judgment. I’ll get us a hotel when we arrive there.”

I didn’t argue. It made sense to me. Instead, I glanced out the window and began to wonder about Lu’s strange disappearance near Judgment.

Hours passed, eventually we made it to Las Cruces. Varo pulled into a gas station on the outskirts of town. I got out and stretched while he filled up the old car. I walked into the convenience store and bought myself a cup of coffee. The man at the counter stared at me in a way that made my stomach feel strange.

As I was attempting to swipe my card, he said, “they know you’re comin’. The Primores told them about your return.”

I blinked. “Sorry, what?”

“Ya need to enter your pin,” he said.

“Oh,” I typed in my pin number, grabbed my coffee, and left. 

Despite the warmth of the air outside, there was something cold inside my gut. Something about the strange, nonsensical words from the clerk made me feel ill. For the first time, I began to question what I was doing. I pushed those feelings aside and told myself that I was just tired, that was all. 

I took over for the remainder of the drive. I sipped my coffee, realizing only then how terrible it was. ‘Coffee’ was a pretty strong word for something that tasted like it had been filtered through a dirty sock. 

Beside me, Varo reclined his chair slightly and kicked his heavy boots onto the dashboard. I figured he would fall asleep like that but to my surprise his eyes remained open, focusing on the world outside the car.

For a while I drove in silence, assuming that Varo would eventually fall asleep. 

“How’d you become a PI?” 

“I went to college for criminal justice…I’ve always been interested in that kind of stuff,” I said simply. “After school I decided to pursue a career as a private investigator. Learning the truth about things has always been important to me.” 

I was careful not to elaborate too much. 

He nodded. “Did you study in Arizona?”

“No,” I said. “I actually lived in Denver for a while before I moved to Phoenix.”

“Why did you move?”

I hesitated before saying, “I had an…abnormal childhood. I don’t remember much of it…the doctors say it was amnesia. I moved to Denver as soon as I was old enough to leave foster care. After Denver, I found Phoenix and I guess I’ve been there ever since.”

Varo said nothing for a long time. I wondered if I had over shared. Most people didn’t want to hear about foster care and childhood amnesia. It was really a bit of a mood killer.

“That sounds like a difficult childhood,” he said at last. I could feel his eyes on me as I drove.

“Yeah,” I admitted. It was weird how the night could make you admit things you would never say in the day. “If I couldn’t know the truth about what happened to me, then I wanted to at least help others know the truth.”

“So, you really don’t remember your childhood?”

“Not before the age of about fifteen,” I said. “At first, they told me my memories would resurface, but at this point, it’s been too long. I don’t think I’ll ever remember who I was…where I was raised.” 

Typically, when I thought of the lost time, I felt very little at all. It was so long ago, I often couldn’t bring myself to grieve my memories. However, in the dim light of the car, I felt an unfamiliar pressure behind my eyes. 

It was as if the highway was hypnotizing me to *feel*. I said nothing more about my past to Varo that night. And he didn’t ask anything more.

The sun was just a spark on the eastern horizon by the time we made it to the exit for Judgment. So far, Varo was right about western Texas, there wasn’t much to see. 

For the most part, it looked similarly to eastern New Mexico, an expanse of rugged hills. Small brush covered the ground in many areas, providing cover for all manner of desert wildlife. In the distance, mountains guarded the horizon.

The exit leading off the interstate was hardly an exit at all. The mile-marker sign had been run over. I only knew where to turn off because of the GPS I had programmed with Lu’s last known coordinates.

I followed the directions off the interstate and onto what looked to be a county road. However, much like the exit, it was unmarked. If this was a red flag, I wouldn’t have known it at the time. I was too busy feeling an overwhelming sense of indigestion, or at least that’s what I thought it was. 

My stomach churned as sweat began to drip down my back.

“I…I need to pull over,” I said suddenly.

I swerved onto the shoulder of the road. Before Varo had a chance to respond, I put the car in park and practically launched myself out of my seat. 

I retched on the side of the road, grasping the car’s bumper for support. When I had finished, I found that Varo had gotten out of the car to check on me. He hesitated with a disgusted look on his face.

“What’s wrong?” He asked.

“I…” again, I threw up. 

For once I was thankful for the desolate nature of the desert. No one drove by as the contents of my stomach were emptied onto the dusty road.

Without a word, Varo handed me a napkin. I accepted it with a nod of thanks and cleaned myself up.

“I’ll drive for a little while,” he said as he walked to the driver's side and sat down. “Judgment isn’t far. Do you think you’ll be alright until we stop again?”

“Yeah,” I said as I collapsed into the passenger seat. “That was weird. I’ve never been sick like that from driving–it must have been the food.”

Gas station food didn’t exactly have the best rap. Likely, the burrito I had grabbed from our last stop had gone bad.

Varo pulled the car back onto the road without a word. 

“Sorry about that,” I said. It was hard not to be embarrassed. 

“Don’t be,” he said. “It could be the elevation. Drink some water.”

The elevation didn’t seem like it would have changed much since Las Cruces. If anything, it would have made more sense for it to go down. However, I did as Varo suggested.

“If this town is as small as it seems, we shouldn’t have a problem finding your sister,” I said.

“How small did it say it was?”

“That’s what’s weird…it doesn’t look like there’s a town out here at all. I mean it’s not listed on Google Maps.”

“Then how do you know it’s here?”

I gave a small laugh. “Yellow pages. I looked up the number Lu had called and traced it to a towing company called Judgment Auto and Towing. They had nothing listed online other than their number. So, I ended up searching for anything with the name ‘Judgment’ from around this area, that’s when I found it listed as a town.”

“That’s strange,” he said. His dark eyes were glued to the distant mountain on the horizon. “It must be really small.”

I shrugged. “I guess. Or maybe it’s a bit of a ghost town.”

“It could happen. A lot of towns were built off of mining but when gold couldn’t be found, they sorta just…faded.”

I nodded. I knew all about ghost towns. Anyone who spent any time in the southwestern United States had heard about them. It wasn’t a stretch to say that Judgment was likely dying if not nearly dead. Possibly there weren't even enough people who lived there to warrant listing it as a true town.

“At the very least,” I began. “It will be a place to start.” 

I stared at the dusty landscape and found it hard to think about a young woman willingly staying out there. What was Lu doing in a landscape like this? Would there even be a hotel to stay in?

I wondered about what I would find when we reached Judgment as I gazed out my window. After leaving the interstate, we had been steadily climbing in elevation. We were by no means in the mountains, but the elevation had been increasing slightly throughout the drive. It was possible that Varo was right and my sickness was caused by the climb.

The road was windy, but seemingly for no reason other than to be confusing. It wasn’t long before I found myself disorientated. We were going north? South? I was typically skilled with directions, but the sky had turned a hazy shade of white and I could no longer see the sun.

After about a half hour of driving, I saw a giant rock formation on the horizon. It wasn’t a mountain or a mesa, but rather a large monolith-like structure that rose from the earth like a finger pointed up. It was white instead of the sandy color of the earth. 

I felt an odd sensation in my chest and suddenly, I was overcome with a memory so vivid it felt like it was happening right then and there.

*I saw the light of day, but it was just a sliver of it.* 

*On my hands and knees I crawled toward the narrow exit of the coven. Rocks scraped my bare skin but I was determined to make it out. I had to make it out. Behind me, the cave echoed with a noise that made me sick, a dull clicking sound.*

*I crawled until I could pull myself out of the cave. My knees were bloody and bruised but I pushed on. The hole up ahead was barely large enough for me to fit through. Despite this, I stretched through it, shimmying and crawling like an animal in a trap.* 

*At last, I managed to get free. My palms were slick with blood as I pulled myself out of the hole in the earth and into the scorching bright light of day. A sob overtook me as I collapsed onto the ground.* 

*I gazed up at the giant monument that now towered over me.*

I came back to reality with a jolt, realizing that tears had been streaming down my face. The car was pulled off on the side of the road and Varo was staring at me with a strange expression. Worry creased between his brows as he watched me.

“Are you alright? What the hell happened?” He asked.

“I don’t know,” I said as I breathed heavily. “I had…a memory.” 

I stared ahead at the giant stone monolith that took over the horizon. Deep dread settled in my chest.

“Are you…good?” He raised an eyebrow. 

I must have looked like a mess. A few minutes ago I was puking up my guts on the side of the road, now I was sobbing in the passenger seat. *Some investigator I am*, I thought.

“Yeah,” I said. “I…I think I’ve been here before.”

A dark expression crossed Varo’s face. “If you want, I can turn around and drop you off at the nearest town.”

“No, no,” I said, coming back to reality even further. I shook off the strange sensations. “The nearest town is over an hour away. We’re so close. I…I think I might just be confused.”

With a bit of hesitation, Varo pulled back out onto the county road. I stared ahead.

“What is that thing up there?”

“A rock formation,” Varo said with a dismissive shrug. 

Despite his calm demeanor, I was drawn to his hands. They grasped the steering wheel with intensity. His tan skin looked white from the death-grip he had on the car.

I noticed that the road we were on was headed directly towards the monolithic stone. Varo could have been right. It could have just been a rock formation. However, I had seen Arches National Park and Monument Valley. 

While the giant stone ahead of us could have easily been a similar formation, there were no others around it. It was a lone rock, jutting into the skies. Its white stone looked unnatural against the dusty, tan landscape.

Despite the nausea in my gut and the strange memory I had, I told myself it was nothing. There was no possible way that I had been here before. This was far from where I had been found on the side of the road. I had never set foot in Texas let alone a strange desolate town called Judgment.

I recently had a trip for business to Brazil, and I had a really good time. Despite what Google would probably tell you, about the crime there and instability, the majority of people I encountered were nothing but friendly And welcoming. 

Less than a week coming back to LA, I am back to the reality of people just being awful and careless. Another week of people not giving leeway when trying to merge in traffic, instead beeping at you, flipping you off.

Another week of being invisible to everyone else. I had a bad interaction today during my day off. Yesterday morning, I went to go get coffee from a local spot I haven't been to before. A co-worker recommended to me. I went in there, ordered my coffee, and it was a little busy. I had to use the bathroom while I was waiting, so I walked towards the mens room.

The hallway was a bit thin and it was kind of hard for two people to pass it once going opposite ways. This blonde woman came out of the woman's room, talking loudly on her phone with her earbuds in, and wasn't paying attention to anything in front of her. I tried to avoid her but she ended up bumping into my shoulder anyway. 

We locked eye contact and her eyes bulged, and she had an instant grimace on her face. I excused myself and she just continued on her way. She kept talking to her friend and I couldn't hear the entire next sentence, but she said something to her friend like ""fucking short ***something*** not paying attention to my space"" 

I don't remember exactly what was said, but it was a dull, dark reminder why I hate this city so much. Most people in LA are like this. People say not the generalize, but you need to see it for yourself. People are so unaware of the world around them here and so selfish of others.

It didn't help me that she was about 5'7"" or 5'8"". Really ruined my day but it made me look forward to my soon travel abroad for work again soon. 

So done with LA.

Pagkagising ko, literal na andun pa rin yung aura sa vision ko, malaki na siya at halos mag-subside na. Alam ko na once mag-subside ‘yon, doomed na ako kasi doon na talaga nagsisimula yung hell na sakit ng ulo.

That night, nagmamadali akong bumangon at tumakbo sa kusina para maghanap ng gamot. Unfortunately, wala akong mahanap na ibuprofen or paracetamol kahit saan. Medyo panic mode ako kasi alam kong ilang minuto lang, sasakit na ng sobra yung ulo ko. So what I did was gumawa ako ng black coffee, i chugged it then nilagyan ko ng kanin, tapos kinain ko kaagad.

To my surprise, like magic, hindi na lumabas yung sakit. As in zero pain. Para akong nanalo sa jackpot kasi usually, once dumating yung migraine attack after aura, halos hindi ko na kaya gumalaw, nasusuka at gusto nang mamatay. Pero that night, coffee with rice saved me.

Sa situation ko kasi, kapag may migraine aura ako sa LEFT eye vision, once mawala na yung aura, guaranteed na yung RIGHT side ng ulo ko ang sobrang sasakit. Same din kapag sa right eye, sa left side naman ng ulo yung sakit. Kaya talagang na-trauma na ako sa aura kasi parang warning sign na ng hell ride.

1nlxe1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugInWellness/comments/1nlxe1h/reveal_if_howard_orange_oil_wood_polish_truly/,Reveal If Howard Orange Oil Wood Polish Truly Revives Furniture,"Howard Products ORS016 has quickly become a staple in my cleaning routine, and I’ll admit I might be slightly obsessed with its zesty orange scent. Regularly using a wood cleaner on my kitchen cabinets and antique furniture was never a priority until I tried this product. It’s a whole new experience—both sensory and practical. From the bottle to the results, this wood furniture cleaner really stands out.

**Impeccable Design and Natural Ingredients**

The slim 16 oz bottle fits conveniently in a cleaning caddy or tucked away in a cabinet. What I appreciate the most is how straightforward it is to handle during use. There’s nothing over-complicated about the nozzle; it's just an easy-to-spray design that provides even application. The standout feature here is the use of real orange oil. Yes, that fresh citrus aroma doesn’t just smell amazing; it’s functional and environmentally friendly. Unlike traditional wood polishes that rely on silicone or linseed oil (which can leave residues or alter the wood’s natural feel), this product truly embraces simplicity with a nod toward sustainable cleaning. 

**Positives**

- Infused with real orange oil for a refreshing scent.
- Enhances wood’s natural glow while preventing fading.
- Safe to use on all wood surfaces, even teak and unfinished wood.
- Free of wax buildup, silicone oil, and harmful additives.
- Replenishes dry finishes with mineral oil for lasting protection.

[Check Howard Products ORS016 price on Amazon.](https://sanue.com/p/b000glhw22/)

**Performance That Shines (Literally)**

The first time I used this, I tested it on an old oak coffee table that hadn't been polished in years. A few sprays combined with some gentle buffing brought the surface back to life. Since then, it’s been equally impressive on everything from kitchen cabinets to picture frames. What really sets it apart is the way it quickly removes surface dust and dirt while leaving this gentle, glowing finish. My chairs no longer seem dull, and even the small cracks in the wood appear less pronounced. It's almost as if this orange oil spray rejuvenates tired, lifeless furniture.

**Some Areas for Improvement**

- The citrus scent, while lovely, may not appeal to everyone.
- It’s not ideal for accomplishing heavy-duty cleaning tasks.
- Requires regular use to maintain its effects.

**Target User**

This cleaner is perfect for anyone with a home full of wood furniture. Whether you have antiques, modern wooden pieces, or natural, unfinished wood items, this product will cater to your needs. It’s also ideal for families who prioritize non-toxic cleaning options. I even caught my cousin—who despises cleaning—giving her side table an impromptu polish. That alone speaks volumes about how satisfying and simple it is to use.

**Practical Applications for Everyday Use**

I’ve used this orange oil cleaner for various purposes, from touching up damaged dining chairs to giving my hardwood headboard a mild refresh. My grandmother, who cherishes her collection of mid-century cabinets, swears by it now. The product conditions the wood without leaving a greasy residue. Just make sure to use a lint-free cloth during application; it works like magic for even results.

**Product Contenders**

Howard Products competes in a crowded market filled with household-name wood polish brands, but a few peers like Pledge and Old English come to mind here. Pledge furniture polishes may offer a wider range of scents, but they sometimes leave that slightly waxy feel after application, making the surface prone to smudges. Old English excels in deep scratch repair, something this cleaner doesn’t focus on, but lacks the light fresh scent and ease of everyday use you get here. Where Howard Products shines is its balance of conditioning and cleaning—all wrapped up in eco-safe ingredients with a pleasant smell. When you’re looking for consistent everyday polish as opposed to a heavy-duty touch-up solution, this is the clear winner.

**Bang for the Buck**

From a value perspective, this wood cleaner balances functionality and price very effectively. While some competitors charge more for infused oil products with added claims, this cleaner does its job without additional fluff—no gimmicks or hidden costs. This level of quality, combined with a sustainable approach, feels worth every penny. Its versatile usage across furniture, cabinets, and more enhances its practicality as well.

So the other night, I get back to my apartment after another lousy shift, and there’s a freakin’ letter addressed to me on my bed. Not in the stack of bills piled up under the mail slot, ON MY MATRESS. Looked like it came out of a fantasy story, fancy wax seal on the envelope and everything. I asked the landlady if the security cameras covering my hallway recorded anyone breaking in, but it just caught that punk from 4F making out with his latest girlfriend. All my windows were still locked from the inside when I checked. Creeped me the hell out.

 

I didn’t open the letter for a few days. Figured if someone was playing a prank on me, they’d out themselves if I didn’t bring it up for a while. But I got curious, and a few hours ago, I popped the seal and read it. here’s what it said:

 \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dearest Nephew,

 

If you are reading this, it means my long life has finally drawn to a close and I must pass along the Family Estate to my most eligible next-of-kin, which is you. Being a single man in his youth with few social obligations, you are the prime candidate to undergo this venture. Just imagine it: your own private island with a lavish mansion, breathtaking scenery, full amenities (even wifi!) and never having to work another day in your life! And all you have to do to leave the dreary world of the 9-5 wageslave, is pack your bags!

But I think I’m getting ahead of things. Allow me to introduce myself. You have never met me, but I am your father’s Great (great?) Uncle Stanley (your Grandmother Constance’s cousin). Given my less than respectable lifestyle in my youth, and my “disappearance” sixty years ago, it would be no surprise if the memory of me had been conveniently swept under the rug. I gather my life before undertaking this lifelong vacation bears similarity to yours; I kept to myself with little social interaction, had disinterest in work and studies, and had nothing to occupy my time but my vices. And much like yourself and those before me, I was in my early twenties when I got a letter from a forgotten relative with the deal of a lifetime. Since then, my entire life has been spent in luxury and peaceful isolation. I kept up to date with the outside world through newspapers, television, and the internet. Supplies arrive regularly at the dock, and I have never found myself wanting. I enjoyed many hobbies such as fishing, swimming, gardening, island chores, and even did a spot of writing.

Now, as I feel my age catching up to me, I must pass along this paradise and prepare its new tenant, or should I say Caretaker, for what awaits you should you choose to take up this offer. For while your life here will be luxurious, nothing is free, and there are a few simple responsibilities you must keep tabs on. That, and living in isolation means you must be aware of any and all hazards so as not to find yourself caught with the proverbial thumb up your keister. Don’t worry, our family has been enjoying this island for generations, and through over three centuries of trial and error, we have this place figured out to a tee. The mansion’s library will have all you could want to know about this place’s history and rules of upkeep, and I will write several more “cheatsheets” to help you with the more nuanced tasks. But for the sake of brevity, this letter’ll just get you up to speed on the process of getting you settled on your arrival.

Should you accept the responsibility, a car will pick you up at first light the day after you open and read this letter. You’ll know it when you see it. Don’t ask how it knows to come, just be ready at the curb with your belongings. Don’t leave anything behind you want to lose as you won’t be coming back. From there, you will be driven to port, where your driver will point out the ship waiting to take you to your new home. The crew will load your belongings; UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES are you to offer to help them but DO be sure to thank them for their services. They’re persnickety about these things, and besides you’re about to begin a new life of leisure; no point in throwing all that away by becoming the newest member of the crew.  

Once onboard, the trip will take four days. Do not worry if you have a tendency towards seasickness; the helmsman is sure, and the ride is smooth no matter the weather. However, while you are allowed full access to the ship during the day, IT IS IMPERATIVE that at night you STAY ON THE TOP DECK. Under no circumstances should you venture below deck at night regardless of threats of impending storms, as the crew is restless and the moonlight’s protection won’t reach below. Instead, spend your nights at the forward topdeck near the ship’s figurehead, and sleep during the day in the shade. Also, while the cook is a surly individual, he has a jovial nature at heart and his cooking is immaculate. But whatever you do, DON’T ask for seconds, and POLITELY DECLINE THE GUMBO. Longpig may sound delicious but believe me when I say it is one culinary venture you don’t want to take.

When you arrive at the island, the crew will unload your belongings into a golf cart with a storage trunk parked near the dock for your convenience.  It is now safe to assist them if you so desire. Be sure to thank them again for their services and wish them well. Shake the Captain’s hand, but DO NOT do so with the Helmsman. Stay at the dock and watch until they sail out of sight. If you happen to see the ship capsize, check the mooring post on your right. If the time matches what was carved into the wood, then there is nothing to worry about. If it doesn’t, note the time for later, then begin making your way along the path to the Mansion up the hill.

You should reach the house well before sundown. Try not to get distracted with the scenery, there’ll be time enough for that later. The front door should be unlocked, but when you first arrive, pass it up and instead park the cart to the right of the mansion by the greenhouse. You can leave your belongings there; they will be moved to your quarters that night after you familiarize yourself with the house a bit. The door closest to the greenhouse opens into the kitchen. If the ship that brought you here went under at a time other than what was carved on the mooring post, write it down on the clipboard hanging next to the sink. Feel free to grab a LIGHT snack from the fridge if you’re feeling peckish but be sure to save room for dinner. Then walk through the green door which opens into the dining hall. The tables will be set and all but one of the chairs will be pushed in. Leave this chair out and the  half-eaten food in front of it untouched; it is the Custodian’s seat, and he will return to his meal after he brings in your belongings later in the night.

From the dining hall, you will walk into the main foyer. Take your time to appreciate the marble staircase, and see if you can make out the faint impressions left by feet from three centuries of our family treading up and down them. Make your way up to the third floor landing and take a right. The opulent door at the end of the hall is the Master Bedroom, but do not enter, as the custodian sleeps there between tenants and values his privacy. Instead, politely knock three times, and announce that you are the new occupant and will be requiring him to return to his assigned quarters by the morning. Then, return downstairs to the dining hall, where your own dinner will be waiting for you at the main table.

After dinner, be sure to stack your plates and utensils neatly. You want to make a good impression with the custodian. Then, return to the Foyer and go through the large green double doors on the other side of the mansion. This is the Library, where you will spend the night while the Custodian readies your room and gets you settled in. The armchair by the fireplace is quite comfortable, and in my recent years, I find myself comfortably sleeping here more than the master bedroom. While there is an extensive collection of books, I guess that you’ll be more interested in the small paper taped to the underside of the coffee table with the wifi password. However, I would advise you read the letter I will leave in the large green book on the writing desk. It will entail how to proceed with your first day as the Island’s Caretaker, as getting a feel for these things ahead of time helps.  By 9:45 p.m., close and lock ALL LOCKS on the double doors, and check to ensure the window locks are in place and NOT LOOSE. A small screwdriver is in the left drawer of the writing desk if they need to be tightened. Then, get comfortable and spend the rest of the night here. Ignore any noises coming from the hallway. The Custodian will be using the front door throughout the night, so expect to hear it opening several times. If you need to use the bathroom, there is one on the other side of the blue door to the right of the fireplace. There is a small case with reusable earplugs on the mantlepiece. I would advise you use them this first night, as the local wildlife tends to get vocal after 10:00 p.m., and while most are harmless, their calls can be unsettling for those unaccustomed to them. On that same note, if you hear your name in the night, DO NOT respond or react in any way. Just don’t. Trust me, it’s not worth it.

And that should cover your first night on the Island. You will be awoken in the morning with three knocks on the Double Doors. This is the Custodian letting you know he has finished transferring your belongings to the Master Bedroom. He will not enter the mansion again except for the scheduled cleaning days. From there, refer to my aforementioned letter in the green book for everything you’ll need to know about officially becoming Caretaker of the Island and all it entails.

I do hope you’ll take this chance of a lifetime, but the choice is of course yours. Regardless of your decision, I hope this letter found you well, and that you will continue to have a pleasant life.

 

Sincerely,

Great (Great?) Uncle Stanley

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

 

I still had the login for the family tree service my grandmother got for us before her passing, and sure enough, I did have a Great Uncle Stanley, although there was next to noting about him other than his name. While it could be (and probably IS) a scam, I gotta admit, it’s not like I’ve got a lot to lose. My job sucks ass, and I’ve had to sell most of my belongings just to cover the rent in this glorified storage unit of an apartment. I haven’t been close with most of my family in years, not since I was falsely accused of SA in highschool because the popular girl was bored. Same incident lost me the few friends I had so my social circle is non-existant too. I only have a small backpack, but it can fit what few clothes and possessions I have easily enough.

 

Honestly, I’m at the point where I’ll try anything over this dead-end life I’m living now. I’ve got my stuff out on my mattress ready to be packed, and let my boss know I won’t be in for a few days. I’m going to wait outside tomorrow for the car to pick me up. If you don’t hear from me in a week, they probably took my kidneys or something. I’ll post again when and if I can.

Hoping for advice from people who have used them.

**What I care about most**  
• Maintenance and cleaning, especially the milk system. Daily and long-term ease really matters.  
• Taste sacrifices. I know Philips offers extra presets like iced coffee and travel mug, but does that come at the cost of weaker black coffee or less flavour compared to the Evo Next.  
• My use: mostly cappuccinos and lattes, parents like coffee with creamer or black, and I will drink an iced coffee around 2 times a week.

**Questions**

1. How do the two compare for ease of cleaning and long-term upkeep? Any problems with milk residue, grinder wear, or plastic parts?
2. For black coffee: is Philips really milder than De’Longhi, and is that difference noticeable for daily drinking?
3. Are the Philips extras (iced drinks, travel mug, etc.) genuinely useful, or do they trade off against taste and quality?
4. If there is a better option around 650 euros in the Netherlands for my use case, what is it and why?",1,1758372591.0,superautomatic,1,1.0,False

I thought I would have enough money to go to a restaurant and treat my friends but Im kinda strugling to finance it, also restaurant food is not really cheap in my country.
At first I planed to not celebrate my birthday this year cause of finances (the same as last year) so I mentioned it to my sister(17) and the reason behind it. She said ""again"" and I said ""yeah"". Then I mentioned to her that I would have to celebrate it here in our apartment. I didn't mention to her in detail what I would do. 

The plan was my birthday would start when she would be in school and when her classes end that is when my birthday would end so that I would not bother her since it is her last year in high school(4th year, she started to go to school earlier). Witch I will admit I was wrong for not mentioning the plan to her. Then she said ""Why wouldn't you be able to celebrate your birthday in a restaurant?"" I sait ""It is cause of my finances and I wouldn't have enough"". She said in a cokky tone ""Well restaurants arent THAT expensive🙄""(btw I keep on updating my friends about my b-day cause Im not sure how it will turn out).

Since a restaurant is out of the picture, I decided for a picnic BUT it will be to cold, so that is also out of the picture. 

Then I decided to just go out with my friends since they don't want me to be alone on my birthday and just want to see me. They are really nice to me and Im really gratefull that I have such understand and special friends in my life. They don't care if it is fancy or basic they just want me to be happy and have a good time together. Tho I fell really sorry that I can't treat them properly on my own B-day. They also reasured me that it would not be lame or not special even though I think otherwise.

I’m a 26 year old guy, and I’m starting to feel ready for marriage and what I want is simple: a godly marriage with a woman who loves Christ, who I’m attracted to, and who complements me in personality, strengths, and weaknesses.

Here’s the catch: I’m interested in two women.

Girl #1: A friend from a past job. Her dad’s a pastor, and though she’s not in my church, we’ve kept in touch. At first I wasn’t romantically interested — she was just a genuinely kind and encouraging friend. But over the years, I’ve found myself drawn to her more and more, both in character and appearance.

Girl #2: A sister in my own church. From day one I’ve been attracted to her. We serve together, chat casually, and I’ve kept it low-key — just getting to know her as a friend. But (drumroll please) … she’s amazing. Truly selfless, a blessing to everyone around her.

So yeah, I’d genuinely like to get to know both of them better.

Now, context: I grew up in a broken Christian home. My parents had serious issues and divorced. So I don’t buy into the fairy-tale version of marriage where everything’s happily ever after. I know marriage is a beautiful gift from God, but it can also be hard when people are selfish.

Because of that, I’m cautious. I want to explore wisely before I make the biggest covenant of my life.

I’m not out here promising marriage to either woman. I’m just talking about asking them out for coffee, spending time, and seeing where things go. If I’m drawn more to one, I’d let the other down as kindly and godly as I can. If they both say no, that’s fine. If one says yes, great.

So here’s my question: is it wrong to pursue both if the opportunity opens up? Or should I pick one and shut the other door immediately?

I’m asking sincerely because I know what I want: if I like two godly women, what’s wrong with wanting to get to know them both a little better before making a choice?",0,1758371605.0,TrueChristian,38,0.23,False

1nlwz7s,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nlwz7s,Need full lounge layout ideas - study/music desk & dining for 6 (pastel gamer/cozy/compact vibe),"**TL;DR:** Please propose whole layouts (desk+music, dining 4–6, maybe a couch) or otherwise give general advise/answer questions below. Pastel white/blue “cute gamer” desk zone, but struggling figuring out the rest of the room aesthetic/colour palette. Rental; student budget (Marketplace/IKEA).  
\-----------  
I’ve just moved into a new rental and this is my first time having full control over furnishing a space. I’d love advice and ideas for *how to furnish and lay out the entire lounge*. Assume I have no furniture (ignore temporary furniture in the photos). Photos + floor plan with measurements attached.

**What I need in the lounge:**

* **Study/music desk** \- must fit 3 guitars + medium keyboard (usually on desk) + PC setup. I also use this area as a video backdrop for recording short guitar/music videos.
* **Dining table** \- ideally seats 6 (minimum 4). (Also doubles as my cosplay/arts & crafts workspace.)
* **Maybe couch for PC?** \- since I've invested into wired audio equipment at my PC, I don't think I'll get a separate TV. Considering getting a small couch in front of my PC to watch shows or play video games with friends when they're over - not sure if this possible/ideal due to spacing.

**Style / vibe:**

* At my study desk: **“Cute gamer” / cinnamoroll** vibes: white + pastel blue, LED strips, compact and cozy.
* But I don't think I should make the rest of the room the same vibe - e.g. making every piece of furniture white is not the play. In general, a **compact, cozy** vibe sounds great. I'm unsure of what colour palette to use though.
* Lots of gaming/art posters that I’d like to include if they can fit the aesthetic.

**Constraints:**

* Renting - no painting walls or changing floors. One white wall, the rest are yellow brick (rugs and free-standing shelving are okay).
* Postgrad student budget - most furniture will come from FB Marketplace + IKEA.
* Big sliding doors flood the lounge with natural light in the afternoon.
* Already have good built-in storage (still will get open shelves for display - will still likely need one more shelf for storage).

I’d like to see how people might furnish this lounge if it were yours, given my needs and style. Where would you put the desk, dining table, couch, shelving, rugs, etc.? What colour palette would you pick, how would that affect furniture/decor? Any additional items to help bring the room together? Mockup sketches or just detailed descriptions are welcome!

**Some specific concerns I’m struggling with (feel free to factor these in):**

* If the desk is visible from the dining table, does that make the room feel cluttered of differing types of spaces merged together? Should I use shelving as a divider?
* Could a small couch behind/near the desk work, or would that feel cramped? I'm struggling to think where to place my desk + dining table to make this room work...
* How can I balance the cute white/blue desk area with the rest of the room (e.g. dining room) so it feels warm and cohesive instead of awkward? Do I try to make the room one cohesive aesthetic (how do I do that then when the desk is a very ""energetic"" vibe) or try to separate different sections of the room?
* Any tricks for making the yellow brick walls play nicely with the “cute” aesthetic and posters?

**Other notes / big picture:**

* I’d prefer to keep both desk and dining table in the lounge - I don’t want to do work in my bedroom.
* That does raise the question of what to put in the bedroom. I’m leaning toward making it a cozy “hangout room” with a couch or beanbag + small coffee table, and theming it around coral reefs (a pun on my name). Open to advice here too, though not the primary concern.
* Shelving for storage is less urgent since I already have generous built-ins near the entry and a wardrobe, but I imagine I’ll need some for decor or general overflow. I have plenty of cute things/figurines to put on shelves across the room.

Spontaneously, we planned a short escape: a bike ride about 80km outside Bangalore. Just the two of us, the open road, perfect weather, and scenic routes that made us feel like we were riding through a movie.

It wasn’t just a ride it was joy in motion. Wind in our faces, nature on both sides, and a quiet sense of freedom you don’t find every day. Sure, I ended up with a bit of back pain (worth it!), but the ride was one for the books.

And no, I didn’t go in expecting anything  no hopes of love or labels. Just two strangers sharing a moment that turned into a memory. I did think of asking for a hug at the end… but some friendships are too fresh and fragile to risk.

Tried them in water, milk, smoothies, even baked a few.

Some flavors were a daily win, others tasted like regret.

Here’s how it shook out.

The ones I would skip completely:

* Chocolate chip banana bread: fake banana, rough aftertaste
* Blueberry pancakes: more cough syrup than pancakes
* Cinnamon french toast: syrup overload, no balance
* Oatmeal cookie: works better in oatmeal than a shake

These were the tubs I wish I never opened.

Middle of the pack, not terrible but nothing special:

* Chocolate coconut: coconut dominates, niche pick
* Strawberry milkshake: candy strawberry vibe
* Neapolitan: mostly chocolate, vanilla barely shows
* Butterscotch pecan: sweet, kind of artificial
* Vanilla peanut butter: okay in milk, weird in water

They are drinkable, but I would not reorder.

Now the ones you can actually use every day:

* French vanilla: plain and versatile
* Milk chocolate: smooth, tastes like chocolate milk
* Mocha: doubles as a coffee shake
* Mint chocolate chip: dessert vibe in milk, refreshing twist

Safe bets if you want something reliable.

And the top flavors that actually stood out:

* S’mores: marshmallow note shows up in milk, fun shake
* Dark chocolate: rich, not too sweet
* Salted chocolate caramel: balanced, sweet without being overdone

If you only try one, salted chocolate caramel is the safest crowd pleaser.

That link is an affiliate one, helps me keep buying tubs to test and take the loss on bad flavors without costing you anything extra.

So 2 1/2 weeks ago, I packed up my kitchen and moved all my food into high-quality storage containers. All my cookware dishes, food, etc. is out of the kitchen and packed up. I super cleaned everything in the kitchen and as I packed up. 
I sprayed with an IGR and put out Advion gel bait in every room I had seen roaches. I packaged up all the electrical appliances in garbage bags and put paper towels with rubbing alcohol inside and sealed them with packing tape. I moved the refrigerator and stove and dishwasher and cleaned and treated there. Since then, the dog and I have been eating outside on the patio. I’m not preparing any food inside the house except for smoothies with an immersion blender that I wash right away. I keep a large secure container in the refrigerator that’s filled with food I can eat with my hands and I take that out onto the patio when I want to eat. I’m drinking instant coffee and eating at the taco stand near my house a lot. 
At the time this war started, the main infestation was in the kitchen, but I was seeing travelers consistently in my bedroom, my bathroom, and the DR.  
Problem
Things have gotten a lot better, but I am still seeing several roaches every day, some alive and some dead, lots of tiny, but some adults. I’m seeing them in the dining room, kitchen, bathroom, and my bedroom. I think it’s time to re-spray the IGR and put down fresh bait. 
Question
This is a picture of how I’ve treated my cupboards. Do I put the new bait next to or on top of the old bait? Do I remove the old bait?
Does anyone have any additional advice or suggestions? I’m getting weary. A large roach jumped from my bedroom curtain onto the chair I was sitting in last night and insect PTSD is real. ",1,1758371183.0,GermanRoaches,1,1.0,False

Not looking to rush into anything anytime soon. Let’s get to know each other a bit, meet over a coffee/boba and see if we vibe first. I have an endless list of cafes I want to check out around the city. 

Tall, dark, and handsome. 6’ Toronto born and raised. Living in the west end and can drive anywhere, tattoos, fashion sense, work full time, hygienic, clean, confident and attractive. I’m respectful of your time and boundaries, value communication and your safety is always important to me.

In my spare time you can catch me reading in the park, hiking and listening to my playlists, at the gym, or at events around the city. I try not to get into gremlin indoors mode until at least the first snowfall.

Looking for someone who’s single, emotionally available, funny, has free time, and a willingness to try new things. I do have a soft spot for sweet and bubbly personalities. A similar taste in music in the fastest way to get my attention aside from a tray of banana muffins.

Here’s some of the fall outings I have in mind 

Pumpkin carving • Apple picking • Fall picnics • Baking with seasonal ingredients • Haunted houses and corn mazes come Oct • Small town day trips • Cafe crawls • Speak easys • Reading nights inside • Farmers markets • Hikes when the leaves change colors

So feel free to send me an intro with what you’re looking for and let’s see how we can make the most of the season.",2,1758371114.0,R4R30Plus,0,1.0,False

My partner and I spent a week in Tokyo over the summer, and we were lucky enough to spend two unforgettable days with the Bebro crew. The weather was scorching during our visit, but Kengo and Ippei were incredibly thoughtful and made sure we had plenty of breaks to cool off—especially appreciated since we (naively) booked an afternoon tour!

They were also super flexible with the plans and had great backup ideas for both days, which made everything feel relaxed and easy. Over the course of our time together, we explored hidden coffee shops, vintage clothing boutiques, quirky retro stores, and even some charming antique spots.

One of the highlights was an evening out at an izakaya with the team, followed by a pub crawl and karaoke—it was an absolute blast and such a memorable experience.

I can’t recommend Bebro highly enough. It was a real pleasure to meet such kind, fun, and genuine people 😊",2,1758371067.0,TokyoTravel,0,1.0,False

This might seem like a simple question, and I know the usual advice with ex-partners is to do the no-contact thing, and most people would immediately answer ""no"" to this question. But I will give context.

I'm asking on this forum, because I'm trying to slowly come back to faith - and I have been wrestling with this simple dilemma all day now.

For context, I was with my ex for almost 2 years. It was not a christian-based relationship. We met in the workplace and started a relationship pretty quickly. Almost immediately though, I noticed a lot of red flags, a big one being that he turned out to be a very self-absorbed person. Borderline narcissistic if you will. I felt like he was treating me more like an accessory and took little to no interest in my identity and interest etc, all while expecting me to invest 100% into his world (his pet, his family, his interest etc). I felt very unseen and dismissed as a person let alone a partner. And I won't even get into the specifics of the relationship, but please trust when I tell you this.  
The problem was, instead of recognizing the red flags and running for the hills early, I kept giving him the benefit of the doubt, and my self-esteem if you will, was low enough that I kept trying to please him and stroke his ego in hopes that he might change for me and start to actually meet me halfway.

It was a really unhealthy relationship, but the worst part of it (and the hardest part for me emotionally/mentally) is that even though I recognized that he had these narcissistic/egotistical tendencies in the way he dismissed me and pressured me to do things to please him, he would also, in turn, do these incredibly charming and doting things. Like insisting on doing favors for me, cooking for me, bringing me coffee in bed in the morning, giving me things, and little things here and there in forms of acts of service that over time made me love him and see the good in him despite feeling totally emotionally and mentally, conversationally neglected as a person. (and I had tried to gently bring up these issues to him and he either got very defensive & then proceeded to love bomb me, or he then pretended to hear me out, pretended like he would change, and then continue the same pattern shortly after. Nothing changed.)

I initially ended the relationship last year, but we carried on a gray-area relationship for another year and a half. Again this was all in hopes that he would change and make an effort for me and see me. I ended up moving out of the state a little over a month ago. When I left he insisted on helping me and my father pack up the moving truck, and then he handed me a letter to read later on during the drive. I read the letter and it was basically him saying he was still in love with me, saying that he wanted to travel the world with me, and for the first time he actually acknowledged things about me which he had never before. It made me feel very conflicted and confused. We continued to text and he would make these false promises to me over text, and I redeveloped this glimmer of hope that maybe things would finally change/improve. But the dynamic has been hot and cold, close then distant. And needless to say in the last few days I finally realized that this guy has been playing me. He's immature as always and has been playing games, and it was foolish of me to think that he would every make an effort for me. He was never going to visit me or travel with me. He's a liar and a man-child, quite frankly. And I was a fool.

I had been so attached emotionally and mentally to this guy for so long that the first 3-4 weeks, waking up and not seeing a text from him, and then getting a half asked text from him the next day or that evening really just left me in a cycle of laying in bed sobbing from missing him and being angry, but also then relieved when he did text me. A couple days ago he reminded me via text of his self-absorption, and I truly think God helped to heal me briefly from my attachment to him, because I found a quiet strength to not text him back. And I have not texted him in 2 days, and he has not followed up with another text.

He acknowledged my birthday for 2 years we were together, the first year he got me a cake and spent the day with my mother and I, got me some gifts - the second year he called me. Last year for his birthday I went camping with him, got him a cake, a few gifts and we had a nice weekend together. In the midst of the toxicity of our relationship and my delusion that this guy might actually change and improve for me; despite all of it. I still care about him.

I'm not the kind of person who can just turn the light switch off on somebody. If I have a bond with them, I will always care and think about them for the rest of my life. That's just how I am.  
I've been toggling between whether I should text him ""happy birthday. Hope you have a good one."" but I feel like that would acknowledge his ego some more and also seem like I'm okay with the fact that he played games with me despite the false promises he made. But I also worry that if I don't message him at all on his birthday, that he will completely cut me out forever, think me ungrateful for the things he did for me etc.  
I lean towards not texting him, but there is a part of me that feels that it would not be christian for me to ice him on his birthday. That it would be the Christian thing to atleast wish him a happy birthday, especially considering our recent history.

What do you all think and thanks for the advice. Need prayers to fully get over this guy and especially need a prayer that God sends me the man (soon) that he wants me to marry so I can have a life partner and start a family.",2,1758371057.0,Christianmarriage,18,0.62,False

I sleep with the window open all night but over the last few months I have noticed that of a night time when i go my bedroom will smell stale and a bit like sewage or old coffee cups.

 The other day I pulled everything out of the room and cleaned the floorboards really well, but down bicarb etc and it seemed to do the trick but a few days later the smell was back but it seems to only happen after someone has a long hot shower.

There are no pipes running under the house, I have an instant gas hot water on that side of the house and the gas pipe runs along the weatherboards on that side of the house lower down as does the water supply. 

The bath is an old clawfoot and I do find that if the shower curtains haven't been placed right I do end up with the concrete floor a bit wet. Does anyone have any ideas what could be causing the smell? It's only in this room.

Watch summary (7 min) in the profile



Quote 1:

“How much better is silence; the coffee cup, the table. How much better to sit by myself like the solitary sea-bird that opens its wings on the stake. Let me sit here for ever with bare things, this coffee cup, this knife, this fork, things in themselves, myself being myself.”



Quote 2:

“I am made and remade continually. Different people draw different words from me.”



Quote 3:

“Alone, I often fall down into nothingness. I must push my foot stealthily lest I should fall off the edge of the world into nothingness. I have to bang my head against some hard door to call myself back to the body.”



Quote 4:

“When I cannot see words curling like rings of smoke round me I am in darkness—I am nothing.”



Quote 5:

“I feel a thousand capacities spring up in me. I am arch, gay, languid, melancholy by turns. I am rooted, but I flow.”



Quote 6:

“Let us again pretend that life is a solid substance, shaped like a globe, which we turn about in our fingers. Let us pretend that we can make out a plain and logical story, so that when one matter is despatched—love for instance—we go on, in an orderly manner, to the next. ”



Quote 7:

“I need silence, and to be alone and to go out, and to save one hour to consider what has happened to my world, what death has done to my world.”



Quote 8:

“I was always going to the bookcase for another sip of the divine specific.”



Quote 9:

“These moments of escape are not to be despised. They come too seldom.”

Some times just to be able to sit up I have to call for someone to come help me. Then when I can start to walk around, I'm slow and off balance, have to hold onto furniture or the wall to make it to the restroom, and it hurts, bad. It feels like the bottoms of my feet are swollen and rounded . Usually after about 60 to 90 minutes, after I've had my coffee & meds I generally feel normal again (well my new normal, I seriously doubt I'll ever feel the way I felt in 2021, before the big flare that got me diagnosed, again). Any way does this happen to anyone else? Is this common? When I googled it I didn't get much info, idk if I didn't ask the right question or if this is just not a common occurrence.
