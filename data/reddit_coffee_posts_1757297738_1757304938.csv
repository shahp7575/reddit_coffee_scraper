as for weight in 2021 i was 19 and 120 pounds. now im 23 and 138, i was 145. so basically gained 25 pounds in 4 years. im 5’2 so obv overweight. it was gradual and i was on BC for two years. been off for 1.5 years, not much of a difference. i was hoping i’d drop like 10 pounds but nope haha. 

anyway, ik high testosterone is my main issue, but i’ve never been tested for insulin resistance or estrogen dominance because kaiser sucks and doctors refuse to run certain tests. i plan to switch providers for 2026.

right now i am focusing on strength training, walking, eating protein and fiber, i read the glucose revolution. i rarely have sugar cravings and don’t snack. my only issue was drinking coffee with honey and oat milk which i cut out. now i drink matcha with 2% lactose free milk and no sweetener. ive heard soy milk is bad for women with pcos?

i want to take supplements im just scared cause ive read a lot of reddit threads about girls gaining weight with inositol, NAC, berberine, etc. I occasionally take d3+k2, probiotics, magnesium, psyllium husk, drink spearmint tea. should i get the IR test before adding other supplements or just assume i have it like most pcos girlies? 

i also have pretty bad anxiety, some facial hair on chin, weight gain, super irregular periods - some cycles are 22 days others are 40, few times it’s been 28-30, but i never skip. 

i’d appreciate any other advice or suggestions. thank you!",1,1757304747.0,PCOS,0,1.0,False

1nbdy8y,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndiaCoffee/comments/1nbdy8y/affordable_way_to_source_highscoring_foreign/,Affordable way to source high-scoring foreign roasters in India?,"Hi coffee community,

I’ve been honing my pour-over skills for the past three years, and recently upgraded my gear enough to brew top-notch specialty coffee. The main hurdle now is accessibility to higher-scoring lots from roasters abroad.

Ordering directly from roasters like Onyx, Prodigal, or Coffee Collective is very expensive, the coffee itself is pricey, but once you add shipping and customs, the final amount becomes eye-watering.

That’s why I was intrigued to see Indian YouTubers (like Aramse) and Instagram influencers regularly opening bags from roasters such as Hydrangea, Onyx, or Prodigal. It makes me wonder if there’s a smarter way to get these coffees.

For instance, I noticed that Something’s Brewing (India) recently started selling bags from a newer Singapore roaster, and even after customs and delivery, their pricing was significantly lower than buying directly.

So my question is:
👉 Are there similar partnerships or arrangements with other international roasters (like Coffee Collective, Onyx, Prodigal, etc.) that make their coffee more accessible in India?

Would love to hear about your experiences or tips!

1nbduj5,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1nbduj5/the_idiots_guide_to_the_nootropics_subreddits/,The idiots guide to the nootropics subreddits (repost),"Hey!

Welcome to the nootropic subreddit, a community that focuses on enhancing the brain through different methods (pills, exercise, meditation, anything). We'll hopefully be able to help you with your problems and get the extra edge you're most likely looking for. (note: this is an edited repost. original base post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2yd2p5/the_idiots_guide_to_rnootropics_too_long_so_extra/))

So first some background, it all started with Dr. Corneliu E. Giurgea 40-50 years ago (it didn't really, but the history is easier this way). In the 60's Dr. Giurgea first synthesised piracetam, the now well known drug. For almost a decade he must have thought ""Hmm, how can I become more famous, make up a new word and start a new class of drugs?"" and then it finally hit him! If he made up a new word, added some criterias and then published it, he had it all figured out! So in 1972 he published a study that first used the word nootropic (which means to bend the mind) and decided on some criterias. The criterias are:

1. They should enhance learning and memory.
2. They should enhance the resistance of learned behaviors/memories to conditions which tend to disrupt them (e.g. electroconvulsive shock, hypoxia).
3. They should protect the brain against various physical or chemical injuries (e.g. barbiturates, scopalamine).
4. They should increase the efficacy of the tonic cortical/subcortical control mechanisms.
5. They should lack the usual pharmacology of other psychotropic drugs (e.g. sedation, motor stimulation) and possess very few side effects and extremely low toxicity.

To make it easier for you, most people don't use this definition, ""nootropics"" is commonly used as ""cognitive enhancers"" (which might be neurotoxic, have serious sides, tolerance, potentially addictive etc). I would like for everyone to stop doing this, but it will obviously not happen but please try.

The real history goes way back. Humans have always been trying to improve their wetware, Ayurvedic, Shamanism, Chinese, Korean, Siddha, Tibetian, etc have found herbs and the likes by chance that have seemed to enhance cognition That's all I'll say, I know way too little about it.

You've now decided to start on your noot (short for nootropic) and improvement journey, great! We're glad to have you! But first of all I want to give you realistic expectations. Most noots will not be super noticeable or enhance any brain function by a lot, we're just not there yet. Some drugs that seem insanly good in animal models do not transfer to humans at all. Then we have the problem with noots that you do not feel, but still ""works"" (an example for me would be [LLLT](http://www.gwern.net/LLLT)). But as always, people do not respond identically to drugs, you need to try things to know for sure. If you want to feel something you will most likely need to try stimulants or potentially an anxiolytic if you've got anxiety. Also be cautious of interactions, search and read lots before you add new things.

So now that you realize that noots aren't anything like NZT-48 in the movie Limitless we can move on.

# Remember, there's more than just nootropics

It's important to remember that the rest of your lifestyle does matter, and that everything in connected in some way. The first thing you should take care of is your sleep. Try to get your +-8 hours and enhance the quality. When you got that in order you should start exercising, both cardiovascular (which got a lot proof for being a cognitive enhancer) and strength (not as much evidence, but more is coming). Try to be active during the day (try not to sit all day, exercise for one hour and think you're good), it'll help sleep and everything in your life. When you're done with those two things, you have a good foundation. Some find adding meditation will help even more. It may help with any anxiety you have, make you happier and a lot more (cognitive enhancing things). If you don't want to try meditation for some reason, look into neurofeedback. If you do not know how to fix these things, check r/fitness, r/meditation and r/sleep, just check our sidebar relevant subreddits.

[I get the figure is focusing on children, but just think about how it is for this generation and how degenerate and dumber apps and the internet have gotten in recent years. It's no good.](https://preview.redd.it/0rp01y9e6vnf1.png?width=3277&format=png&auto=webp&s=3156b835f410d3b723093bd838a61027c15bc8d3)

Another consideration related to mediation and the mind is social media and internet use which is encouraged by the way smartphones and their notifications, colors, and psychology loops be it likes, feeds, or constant action. Those in charge of advertising and sales don't care why you're watching news channels or on social media, it's all justified to them as long as their ratings and metrics go up, and I think we've seen a lowering of standards and a moral decay of sorts in recent times. Cut those notifications off, hide those apps, be critical of the content or activities you do, and ask yourself if this is truly doing anything useful to you.

When you got that fixed you could look into your diet. This part is super controversial due to different schools of thought. First we have the more mainstream, low GI-carbs, lots of ""good"" fats, lowish saturated, etc. But we also got a bit of the opposite (r/keto), low carb, high fat (any except for transfats), etc. This forces the body to go into ketosis (your cells run on more ketones (except for a few cells)) which might hold some benefit for different populations. There's some research hinting towards being in ketosis might be good if you have blood sugar issues (which might cause alzheimer's later in life and cell damage all through), but to me, it does not seem to hold more promise than that. Fasting is also a worthy consideration I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with me on this, but you need to make up your own mind and do what you want and find practical. Something almost everyone seems to agree on is that consuming veggies and fruits is good, this is backed up by a lot of research. This is due to multiple things, one of which is that veggies and fruits contain a lot of polyphenols with unique effects. Broccoli has been shown to reduce the effects of (some aspects of) autism, blueberries have shown to fight alzheimer's, etc. 

There's also a bunch of supplements that are usually not seen as noots but still have positive effects. The first group would be vitamins. There are a few that most people are deficent in, mainly vitamin K and D. Vitamin K (in the form of K1) is usually just found in leafy greens and K2 (which we usually prefer to supplement) in a few fermented foods. The health effects are quite important for preventing cardiovascular, bone and potentially neurological problems. Vitamin D has in recent years been promoted as the cure all, which it's obviously not. It is however very good for you. There are a lot of correlations between auto-immune diseases and higher mortality in vitamin D deficent people. Adding 2000-5000 IU of D3 daily (and keeping your blood levels checked) should fix the deficency for most people.

If we move within the group micronutrients, but don't look at vitamins, we find minerals. The most significant in this category (relevant to us) is magnesium. To describe it in simple terms, it helps you calm down, promotes synaptic plasticity, help depression, long-term memory and a gazallion other things related to enzymes. If you take it before sleep you'll get better sleep quality and fall asleep faster. There are however forms that have been shown to be fairly worthless, mainly magnesium oxide. You will have to look up what form you want to supplement with. Just be sure to not take too high doses, it might act as a laxative!

Another mineral worth checking out is zinc. Deficiency might lower testosterone and BDNF levels, both which are highly correlated with depression and cognitive functions. Doing too much might have opposite effects on BDNF levels and be toxic, so try to not overdo it. A normal starting dose would be around 15-25 mg, adding copper at other times might also be worth looking into.

If we leave the micronutrients and look into other supplements that are worth looking into, we quickly find creatine. u/silverhydra calls it a pseudo-vitamin (because real defiency results in retardation) which means we must look into it! Creatine is a molecule with a phosphate group bound to itself, if you remember your high school biology you'll remember that ATP becomes ADP and needs a new phosphate group to become ATP again. Guess where you can get that group from? Exactly, creatine! When your cells use up ATP your creatine phosphate donates its group and regenerates ATP. This has been found to be extra effective for vegetarians who consume small quantities of creatine. They are one of the few groups that actually might get an IQ increase from adding it! Other groups that would benefit from it would be elders, sleep deprived and potentially everyone else. It's neuroprotective, might raise your IQ, might make you live longer, modulates a billion things, there's really no reason not to take it.

You've probably browsed multiple sites for starting your stack and then found the nootropics subreddit, so you want us to help you get started. Sure can do! There are several beginner stacks usually mentioned, the caffeine + theanine, piracetam (+ choline), creatine, alpha-gpc, alcar, and some of the herbals which some don't like, like Bacopa, Lions Mane, Rhodiola etc.

[A good scale will last you a lifetime, as well as help you deal with certain nootropics not usually sold in capsules.](https://preview.redd.it/by54p7cf2vnf1.jpg?width=400&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9148c678d3af6783c48d8abe7e8fc070eed3e131)

But something important before you order ANYTHING, get a damn milligram scale! As you're most likely not doing anything that requires exact measurements, something cheap like the Gemini-20  will work. It will run you about $20 and will last you a very long time. This is for your own safety only (and I know you'll get hate/no help if you create a thread asking about what 200 mg looks like in powder form). Some compounds are dosed really low, like below 20mg, and accuracy will def matter there. Plus, who's to know you won't get into powders and put that in capsules yourself. 

And when you do try things out, try to test out a tiny amount, then a half recommended dose, then a full dose in order to test for any sort of allergy.

Be also cautious with what source you use. Scammers pop up all the time in the noot world and leave people disappointed. Be sure too look up your source online and on reddit, a guideline is to mainly buy from sellers than can provide third part CoAs (Certificate of Analysis).

# Nootropic examples

[Some examples of nootropics from a paper. https:\/\/www.researchgate.net\/figure\/List-of-common-nootropics-mode-of-action-desirable-psychotropic-effects-and-adverse\_tbl1\_292502176](https://preview.redd.it/gjs32zpv6vnf1.png?width=850&format=png&auto=webp&s=b7dae1a638af72fd1d0fb97ca90fc71581e08096)

Have you heard about theanine before? If you have, it has probably been in the context of tea. If you have not, theanine is an amino acid analogue that we mainly find in tea. Why are we adding it to our lovely caffeine? Theanine seems to induce a state of calm, but still keep you alert/awake. Adding caffeine to it boosts the alert/awake, thus making the caffeine nicer for you. There are multiple studies on the combo with positive results (and on the individual compounds). If you're already drinking coffee you can pour some theanine in your cup and enjoy it more. The commonly recommended ratio between theanine and caffeine is 2:1 T:C. But be sure to play around with the ratio to see what works best for you. A good starting dose would be 50-100 mg caffeine and 100-200 mg theanine.

Maybe you don't want to use caffeine, you want to expand your stack or have some other reason to add other things. Then you might want to start with piracetam and choline.  This stack has less scientific, but a fair amount of anecdotal evidence (if you care about that). Piracetam was first synthesised by Dr. Giurgea and his team and had some success. The mechanism is not fully understood yet (as with many other drugs) and some argue it's mainly good for the older population, fighting off the age related decline in brain function. The choline is added because one of the mechanisms seems to be cholinergic (the scientific evidence for adding it is weak, anecdotal is not as weak, but still not that strong). When you're adding choline you should be mind the dose. Too high dosages seem to induce depression in a lot of people. The dosage here is a bit more spread between users. Piracetam is taken in doses between 800-4800 mg, 1-3 times a day and choline is taken at doses around 200-1000 mg depending on form. You should however not buy any form of choline, there are better and worse sources. The worst source is choline bitartrate, which should be the last waw out (get some other form if you can). The better forms are Alpha GPC and CDP-Choline. You should try with and without choline to make sure how you respond to them. Try adding them one at a time, as you should with any supplement.

Maybe you don't like the former ones, maybe want to try new things or maybe have some interest Russian drugs. Then you might be interested in noopept, a dipeptide. The evidence is even less for noopept, basically zero in humans in the western world. The mechanism for this one is even less researched. The doses for this compound is 5-30 mg 1-3x daily, orally or sublingual. Too high doses seem to impair working memory for some people, so it's best to start low. One of the creators have been interview by Smart Drug Smarts which you can listen to [here](http://smartdrugsmarts.com/rita-ostrovskaya-noopept/). Bromantane is also worth a look, as well as piracetam, both from Russia with better data.

Maybe you're one of those people who prefer to take ""natural"" things, then we have a herb for you! Maybe the adaptogenic herb Bacopa Monnieri could work for you. Bacopa has been used in Ayurvedic medicine for many years, but as with the other drugs, the mechanism is still not fully understood. The dose used is usually 300-500 mg if it's 50% bacosides. Don't get sad if you don't notice any effects right away, it takes time for it to work, and some people don't believe a beginner should try it out. Herbs have high margins and not as specific mechanisms, so be careful as to what people out there say of it. Other herbs include Rhodiola, Gingko, Panax Ginseng, and the slightly more risky lions mane and Ashwagandha.

There's also more experimental ones that lean towards untested research chemicals and newly developed compounds like tak or acd, be sure to read as much as you can and the anecdotes about everything. Technically, you are taking little risks every single noot you try. A tiny minority for example get medium to long term anhedonia from the healing peptide bpc-157 (this can also happen with melanotan/PT-141). It's so rare and also popular with meatheads that usually the badly affected get made fun of or doubted, but... what's to say you can't have allergies to this stuff? I mean people have allergies to nuts, and nuts are like... why are we allergic to it? Because you just are. r/LionsManeRecovery and r/AshwagandhaSyndrome exist for those rare few affected. That's why... It's important to read a lot about anything to understand how to use it well, what to expect, and what to look out for. 

There are lots of pre-made stacks, but almost all of them have the same problem, under dosed/don't tell the dose, over priced and no proof that the things they use are pure. So research A LOT before buying them.

There are also other ways that just requires your computer, so called brain games! The current brain game that has most evidence is n-back. To keep it short a few studies has shown that it increases working memory and potentially IQ (which is disputed), it's one of the few games that have evidence behind it. The most common form is dual-n-back, where you are keeping track of a sound and a position. If you want to learn more, u/ gwern has by far the best papers on it which you can read [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20FAQ) and [here](http://www.gwern.net/DNB%20meta-analysis). (again, note: this is an edited repost. original base post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Nootropics/comments/2yd2p5/the_idiots_guide_to_rnootropics_too_long_so_extra/))

This is also a good way to keep measuring how effective some of your noots are. Other brain games have not shown as much potential, but can be a way to measure progress. Sites that offers these are [Luminosity](http://www.lumosity.com/) (Paid) and [Cambridge Brain Sciences](http://www.cambridgebrainsciences.com/) (Free), simple apps for reaction time are also worth looking at.",2,1757304185.0,NooTopics,0,1.0,False

I guess I've been guilty of keeping thungs bottled up sometmes, thinking others should just 'get it.' But seeing this coupe made me realize that maybe, just maybe, being clearer about what I want or feel is the seret to getting that level of understanding.

**Original** [Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1myb4lz/aita_for_not_getting_an_ice_cream_machine_with_my/)**: August 23, 2025**

This is a small issue, but I still wanted to get some opinions. My gf who I'll call Sam and I have been dating for a few years now. We live together, and when we decide to buy an item for the house, we share the expenses on said item 50/50.

Recently, a friend of ours has bought a new ice cream machine, and ever since seeing it, Sam has been asking to get one of our own, while I have been against buying one. First of all, we don't eat ice cream that often, even without the machine; in fact, I know that there is a cup full of ice cream in the freezer right now that has been sitting there unopened for quite some time now.

That is not the only reason, however, when Sam sees something like this ice cream machine, she always hypes up how she would use it all the time and how this machine could change our lives, etc., but after the initial hype fades, she never looks at it again. The same thing happened when she wanted a new fancy coffee machine, an air fryer, a bread machine, and the list goes on. She convinces me that they would be good to have around, only for them to never be used again. I told her this, and she promised that this time would be different, but that was also what she said about the coffee machine. We are doing very well financially, and the thing costs, when converted to USD, around 500$, which we can definitely afford, but then again, if no one will use it in the end, what's the point? So, AITA for not contributing to buying the machine?

***Some of OOP's Comments:***

Commenter: Lmao you can buy an ice cream machine for $50. $100 if you splurge. $500 is insane

>**OOP:** Ikr, hear me out though, it can make ice cream, sorbet, AND slushi

Commenter: NTA - if Sam wants to buy an ice cream machine that she won’t use, then she 100% can but leaning into consumerism just because a friend has one doesn’t seem like the best option. Maybe suggest to her that the money could be better spent on something you’d both like, but if she’s dead set on buying one then she can absolutely do that with her own money!

>**OOP:** I don't think I've said this, but I have already told her that if she wanted it that much, she didn't need my permission to buy it. However, she still really wants me to contribute to buying this machine, like she pouts about it when I tell her that I wouldn't be contributing. I think she wants me to contribute because it's too big a commitment, and if she doesn't use it like I told her would happen, she has spent 500$ while taking all the blame of spending the money onto herself, if I contribute, now, I have also approved this item and so we share the blame when it doesn't get used.

Commenter: NTA but you're really missing out by not using the air fryer more, especially in hot weather. It can be really useful, unlike an ice cream machine.

>**OOP:** I'll be sure to give the air fryer a second chance

Commenter: NAH and it's nice to read about a situation on this sub that's relatively universal rather than something over the top. We all do this, it's totally fair to not want the machine but it's understandable that your girlfriend wants it after seeing someone else's

>**OOP:** Just wait till my air fryer divorces me and runs off with Sam

Fuck the ice cream machine, no one cares about the ice cream machine. The air fryer, on the other hand, is absolutely a game changer. The first few times I've used it, everything came out undercooked because I was a dumbass and didn't know how to use the machine. Now that I've put my bigotry aside, I finally get it. The kitchen is not scorching hot, the potatoes are to die for, and the chicken is delicious. Thank you to everyone who convinced me to give this machine another try. Also, I've made my first batch of bread, and it most definitely tastes like bread, so I must have done something right.

As for the ice cream machine, I bought Sam a less expensive model for now, and we'll see if we actually use it. It's been great for now, but it's still too early to tell. Literally no one asked for an update, but since the air fryer was your guys' suggestion, I thought I owed all of you a thank you.

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/WcVI2Pppv8)  **May 3, 2025**

Obligatory throwaway account as people in my life know my usual account.

Posting because I really don’t know how to feel about this and I just needed to get it off my chest. Sorry for the loooooong ass post, there’s a lot to unpack.

Backstory first. So around 2 years ago, my ex fiancé, who I’d been in a relationship with for almost 10 years unceremoniously just left me. 

It never fully made sense to me as there were no warning signs, we were actively planning our wedding and finally agreed to try for a baby, as we were both in our 30’s and time was ticking. Then one day, he just started acting sort of off, wasn’t saying I love you before he left for work for the day, was spending more time out drinking with his friends than he was at home. He’d been struggling with his mental health since Covid lockdowns so I assumed he was having a bit of a downward spiral. So I sat down with him one day and just asked him if everything was okay with him, he tried to brush it off initially and kept saying he was fine, so I changed the question and asked if we were okay, he looked like he really didn’t want to answer, so I asked again, he paused and in that moment, I knew, it was over. I asked if he still loved me, he said he loved me but wasn’t in love with me anymore. And that was it, within a week, he had moved out, leaving 90% of his belongings to be collected at a later date and to serve as a constant reminder that he was just gone.

To say it hit me hard was an understatement, I spiralled massively, I was at the lowest point I had ever been in my life, so I tried to end it all, it just hurt too much feeling like there was something so wrong with me that he had to just leave.

Fortunately a friend managed to get me to a hospital before I did any serious damage to myself and while I still felt awful about myself most of the time, it got a little easier.

I ended up dating that friend a few months later. A lot of people said it was too soon to move on, but honestly I never set out to have another relationship at all, but his constant support, presence and reassurance that there was nothing wrong me made me want to spend time with those who truly gave a shit about me, and in time we developed feelings for each other. We had a beautiful relationship filled with love and laughter, and much to our surprise I ended up pregnant 9 months into our relationship, we decided to keep the baby even though our relationship was still in its early stages and 9 months later our beautiful daughter was born. We are still as strong as ever today and continuing to build an amazing life together as a family.

Now onto present day, I guess my ex has been reflecting on the past recently due to a lot of deaths in his family and his mother (who I’m still close with today) reached out to me to asked whether I’d be willing to meet up with him as he had something to get off his chest, she didn’t know what he wanted to talk to me about as it was something he could only discuss with me, but she would understand if I said no.

I decided to think about it for a few days before I agreed that I would meet up with him at a local coffee shop. I got there early because you know, mama needs her caffeine fix with these early morning wake ups and night feeds. I was already sat down when he came in and he gave me the saddest looking smile while I merely just nodded to him and motioned for him to sit down and get out whatever he needed to tell me.

I was a little bit speechless at what he had to say. He said that when we started trying for a baby and nothing was happening even though we were closely tracking my ovulation cycle and testing every day for that sweet spot, he realised something wasn’t right, so he secretly took a day off work to see a fertility doctor l, they found that due to an undiagnosed issue in one of his testicles, the likelihood of him ever being able to conceive a biological child of his own was incredibly low. He knew that I loved him so deeply that I would’ve given up my dream of having children, just for him and he said he couldn’t live with that on his conscience, that I deserved to have the life and family I’d always wanted, only with someone else. He kept apologising profusely for hurting me so much in the process but tried to rationalise that I had got what I’d wanted in the end, so his plan ultimately worked.

I ultimately sat there silent for a few minutes and just looked at him dead in the eyes and said that that was never his decision to make, he took away my choice and nearly destroyed me in the process. And I got up and left.

It’s been a few days and I’m still processing, my partner knew I was meeting up with my ex and he knows something is up but is giving me space until I feel ready to talk about it, but honestly I’m shook. Like did my ex honestly think I’d be like okay thanks for letting me know and then we’d all be friends again.

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**6017LN**

>He was having an affair that is now over and is reflecting. He used a lie to try to make himself seem like a martyr.

**OOP**

>>I did suspect that for quite some time, there was a girl in our friend group he had become oddly close to over the last year of our relationship, she was one of the main people he was going out drinking with when I started realising something wasn’t quite right, so my mind did go there for a while. He ended up moving in with her as housemates after he moved out. She tried coming over to collect the remainder of his things, I was pretty mad and said I didn’t consent to her being there and if she didn’t leave my property, I’d call the police on her for trespassing. I don’t believe anything was ever actually going on there though as I heard through the grapevine that she was seeing some drug dealer shortly after my ex moved in with her.

**~**

**Ride-Sea-3607**

>Absolutely. Your ex-boyfriend had no right to take away your choice in this matter. Did he know about your failed attempt at suicide? Why did he not come back then and admit that it was all a mistake? Because you couldn't have babies if you are dead, right. I think it is either he is an absolute moron or he is trying to give you some bs reason so that you think of him in a better light going forward.

**OOP**

>>Yes, he was aware of the attempt, we had a pretty close knit group of friends, some of whom were really supportive afterwards, they made him aware. I got a “I hope you’re okay, sorry for everything” message after he found out. I never responded and it was at that point that I blocked and deleted his number and all his socials because I couldn’t trust myself not to drunk message him begging for him to come back.

**~**

**inkypinkyblinkyclyde**

>There were other ways to deal with his infertility. Donor sperm. Adoption. The fact that he would rather have taken this decision from you than discuss options with you proves that he was not a suitable long term partner for you. There are lots of hard decisions couples need to make together, and he demonstrated that he was unwilling to give you any real agency in your life together. You are better off now with your new partner.

**OOP**

>>Oh I know I’m absolutely so much better off. My current partner is pretty much the opposite of my ex, which was why it was such a surprise that I developed feelings for him, he’s extremely different from my usual “type”, but he’s such a good egg. We had chance to talk about everything late last night (our daughter is going through a bit of a sleep regression, so late nights are pretty common for us at the minute 😭), and he was super empathetic and equally as pissed. I got my first period since having the baby this morning and he ran me a bath and told me to go sulk for as long as I need to, bless him.

[Update on the situation with my ex.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fair_Satisfaction709/s/6I8aYbQFnH)  **May 8, 2025 (5 days later)**


If youd like a recap of the story please see my original post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/s/FdkTrGPEEt)

First off, thank you all for your lovely comments and messages of support! I was not expecting my post to blow up like it did.

So I wasn’t really expecting to make an update to my previous post, and definitely not this soon, but boy does it get interesting.

So of course I planned to leave this situation alone at this point and completely put it behind me, however my former mother-in-law reached out to me as I hadn’t spoken to her in a few days which is quite unlike me. 

A few people said in a few comments that I should cut her off as well as the ex, but this woman was like a mother to me for almost 10 years, when I was going through difficulties with my own family, this woman opened her home to me gave me a safe place to stay if I needed. She had been more of a parent to me than my own parents and basically adopted me as the daughter that she had always wanted so when I say we are incredibly close I genuinely mean it regardless of anything that’s happened with her son, we have a really strong relationship outside of that. We typically have a good catchup once a week and message in between, nothing I say to her gets passed on to her son, from what I can gather, the trickles of information he gets is through the grapevine of the group of friends we mutually share. So when she reached out to see if I was okay yesterday, I decided I’d pop over and catch up with her.

Turns out he came clean to her when she asked exactly what had gone on as she hadn’t heard off me in a few days and she was worried, she went absolutely ballistic at him and currently is not speaking to him at all. Then she told me something I did not know and something she assumed I’d known all along. It turns out that when he was born he had undescended testicles, he had the surgery to correct it but there was always going to be the chance that he would have fertility issues in adulthood, he was meant to go for check ups once he passed puberty age to see whether there was any lasting damage and he claimed to his mother that he had gone to these and everything was fine, but neither of us actually believe this.

So the entire time we discussed having children, he knew there was a possibility that all he was shooting was blanks, but neglected to actually let me know this, FOR TEN FREAKING YEARS.

Bear in mind we were probably having unprotected sex for 2 years of our relationship, not actively trying but we had agreed that if something happened, we’d be happy about it, so I think when we were actively trying to have a baby and nothing was happening it sort of gave him the mental tip off that all was not well and he finally decided to get that check up he’d been putting off.

Im flabbergasted guys.

In regard to my partner and I’s relationship, we are absolutely fine, he’s used to my sulky episodes haha. I did eventually fill him in after a few days of being mildly annoyed and he agreed that it was super fucked up and agreed with a lot of the comments that his timing for telling me all this was absolutely comical. We did suspect for a while that the real reason he decided to leave was cheating initially, because he’d gotten strangely close to one of the girls in our friend group (the majority of which dropped me like hot shit once we split), turns out there’s nothing going on there, but a another lil tidbit off my ex’s mum that she found out also, guys he’s dating this girls 60 YEAR OLD MOTHER!!

Good lord his life is a dumpster fire. 
I don’t even think I’m mad anymore, just mildly amused.


Absolutely done with that.

**NEW UPDATE**

[Another update. Sigh.](https://www.reddit.com/u/Fair_Satisfaction709/s/oJsdHLRJy5)  **July 16, 2025**

(So this was sat in my drafts for the last few weeks and forgot to post it).

I so badly wanted to be over and done with all of this and I honestly wasn’t expecting to have anything else to say on the matter despite the fact that I’ve had people messaging me for updates.

Sorry for any mistakes, it’s late and I’m running off about 3 hours sleep.

Life has been peaceful, and had returned to its pre-drama state and I’d pretty much shoved everything to the back of my head, because in all honestly, while the revelation might’ve shocked and temporarily upset me, I just decided to compartmentalise and move on.

So as it turns out (thank you random Redditor who messaged me for an update), my BORU post got ripped by one of those dumb “content creators” who play an ai voice recording of Reddit posts over Minecraft videos, I honestly find these pages incredibly abhorrent, they take someone’s trauma and monetise it without even getting any form of consent from the OP, but I digress. These videos were posted all over socials (YouTube, Facebook, TikTok, etc.) and got thousands of views, so I was suddenly getting waaaaayyy more attention than I expected and honestly it got a little overwhelming.

Lo and behold, the TikTok video manages to land itself on one of mine and my exes mutual friends fyp, the video circulates through the friend group as they are speculating as to whether it’s about me and the ex or not, because there are a lot of similarities, and before I know it, I’m getting Facebook messages off a fake profile demanding I remove the post or make another post saying that everything was fake, that I owe him one. I’ve since had to deactivate my Facebook because every time I blocked an account another would pop up to message me again.

Jacob, I know you’re reading this, you are not some big fucking hero that made my life what it is today, my life is what it is because I put in the work to get myself in a better place after you fucked me up. And you’re STILL trying to fuck me up, but I’m finally at that point where I see you for what you are, a manipulative narcissist. You are not some grand arbiter of fate, what happened, happened, and you only have yourself to blame for the fact that your life went to to shit, go and get some therapy and get over this shit like I did. And stop trying to message my family.

TLDR; Ex found the story, demanded I remove it. Fuck off Jacob.

* It gives you a daily “recovery” score in the morning so you know if it’s a good day to push harder or take it easy.

2. Similar concept but instead of people doing a running design of objects (maybe like a tea cup, coffee cup, matcha cup) and some text

Let’s call me J (20M) and my girlfriend M (22F). We’ve been dating for about 18 months, and I’ve been seriously considering proposing. M has told me multiple times she’d be happy if I did. I’ve already started preparing, and a few weeks ago I asked her father (55M) for his blessing. Here’s where things get complicated.

I generally have a good relationship with her family—except with her mother (MIL 56F). My own childhood experiences with abuse from another family member make some of MIL’s behavior especially hard for me to deal with. She is very controlling of M—she calls her home early from dates, checks her location constantly, and vents her emotional stress onto M without reciprocating support.

Last week, I privately messaged FIL to catch up over coffee and ask for his blessing. He has been very approving of me, but didn’t give a final answer but saying he wanted more time to discuss details, and we agreed to meet again later.

Unfortunately, MIL snooped through FIL’s phone and found my message. She became furious that I hadn’t included her in the meeting and accused me of breaking her trust. She unloaded on M about it, and since then, M has had three anxiety attacks from the stress.

To explain my reasoning for going to FIL alone:

1. MIL is known for gossiping, and I wanted the proposal plans to remain private.
2. I thought asking just one parent would avoid triangulation during planning.
3. I worried that MIL would drop hints to M and ruin the surprise. I had previously planned a surprise birthday party for M, which she had spoiled by asking M if she was expecting anyone to prepare a surprise party for her.

FIL understood these reasons and agreed. But now MIL is furious, M is suffering, and I feel stuck.  
For context:

* M still likes the idea of marriage, but right now she feels extremely stressed about her mother’s reaction, especially after these recent events.
* M is still very much under MIL’s control, whereas I’m quite independent.
* MIL believes that I should have gone through her, as she, M, and I all share the same religion, whereas FIL is respectfully non-religious

How do I move forward? Moving forward could make MIL more hostile and further complicate M’s relationship with her?

TL:DR MIL is frustrated cos I asked to meet FIL alone, when asking for a blessing for proposing to their daughter",3,1757303204.0,relationships,2,0.8,False
1nbdfmp,https://www.reddit.com/r/perfectpitchgang/comments/1nbdfmp/how_i_ended_up_with_perfect_pitch/,How I ended up with perfect pitch,"Been typing this out all week... sorry no autocorrect on computer and it's so long so didn't proof or edit... sorry

40s m and toured playing guitar keys vocals... playing is what I do. Never had perfect pitch and know for sure. Posted pretty harsh last time but actually pretty mellow. Now ppl asking how I learned and getting more dms so here it is. Everyone always argues about it so I'll try to tell everything and cya and it's really just my pov.

where to start... always wanted perfect pitch... never would admit it tho but dunno why. Prob just jealous you couldn't learn it but seemed to make you special. Def no good reason maybe felt guilty for wanting it with no reason or for bad reason dunno.

Now I know every note every time no questions no mistakes. Can pass every test I found and tested myself. Don't like taking tests for other ppl tho bc everyone's always like prove it and I don't really care for that.

Don't walk around and a tiny voice says F, D whatever when I hear stuff like some ppl say but can always tell you if I want without thinking. Like colors I don't hear red, blue in my head but if I want the color of that tree... it's green.

Know the notes of random irl sounds too but confused by the conversation about it bc irl doesn't stay in tune so it's hard to hear ppl say you need that then complain about music if it's not in A440. Like how do you do life bro? You complain to your toothbrush if it's like mine and E and B it makes aren't in tune? Basically I don't have the same issues like that or transposing or other things I keep reading but still worried maybe it goes flat eventually? I'm already old and keep it up so maybe I'm good.

Tried to learn for over 10 years and nothing worked... tried teaching myself... tried just repetition... tried willing myself or convincing myself to just have it... tried stuff that doesn't even make sense I know basically just doing random stuff. Never asked for help or tried to learn about it bc learning perfect pitch was always like fight club just don't talk about it.

Started looking at apps and sites. Everyone's got different ideas of perfect pitch and most things def not what I was trying to do. Like learn the white keys in one octave on piano or learn to tell a major from minor (umm that's relative pitch and I can already) or learn to sing in tune...

Got iPhone X in 2017 or 2018 and buckled down... bought top two apps in the app store tone and earforge. Looking back I don't see anything in reviews about them working. Ratings mostly ppl saying they like how it looks or think it's fun or like a game def not about it works or not.

Tone was $100 a year and I bought it obv really wanted it to work. Did earforge every day too... think it was like $30 for a year. Tried other apps too tbh but didn't buy anything else and just more of the same.

Tone didn't do it for me. Seemed like random groups of notes just check and see if I can get it. When I get it right felt random or just using relative pitch and repetition didn't help. Really didn't feel it was getting any better.

Earforge was worse. Was based on C major scale and everything was just obv relative pitch for me just diff degrees of the scale... went nowhere.

Used both until subs ran out and didn't renew kinda a waste of money tbh. Every now and then checked for apps and never much new stuff. Dunno why I even did that bc really just felt everything just reinforced you can't learn it. Wanted to learn still but also thought you couldn't just wanted it not to be true I guess.

Getting drive thru coffee about 2 years ago heard a song inside. Somehow knew 100% one note was the same from Payphone by Maroon 5. Sang the intro and played on spotify... was exactly right. Stood out bc I couldn't remember thinking about that song or when I heard it... years probably. Never thought before... I wonder if I remember the right key... always assumed any key I thought was random but started keeping track after that. Was right pretty much any time I had that feeling even tho I didn't even know what notes I was singing most the time.

Did that at least a month of paying real close attention to any feeling and trying to sing songs in the key I remember before listening and checking. Got convinced there was perfect pitch in there and just couldn't connect to it. I mean it was def there but I def didn't have perfect pitch and couldn't tell you what note was what. When I heard notes every note still sounded basically the same I think.

Started looking for apps again. Lots I hadn't seen before. Lots still talking about stuff I don't think is actually perfect pitch or wanting you to pay it all up front or it's just for kids or just one octave or smth else. Installed all the apps with the same idea of perfect pitch as me and tried what I could try without paying. Tiny bit better but not a lot.

Was committed and motivated bc for the first time ever I actually believed I could get it. A year ago found app called harmoniq and started using that. Was free with a sub in it but wasn't sure what the sub did and did the free one every day. Think one reason I liked it was bc finally didn't have to pay to try. Also first time it didn't feel like relative pitch as much and felt it was getting better. Still really couldn't actually tell I was improving or not tho.

Started around then paying attention to irl sounds trying to guess pitches and check when I could. Just checked on tuner app on my phone. Still kinda random most the time. First time it felt different I heard a piano play randomly and knew it was E but didn't know how... just knew. Kept using harmoniq and they added a score thing with the circle of fifths. Score improved and was recognizing random pitches in music and irl more often not always but more often. Might not have noticed at first if I didn't keep track.

Didn't really add anything else after I got convinced it was all working. Bought the sub for harmoniq for $30 for a year mostly to do more lessons than I could every day for free and to learn faster.

Harmoniq added a link to reddit in the app and I started lurking and reading about perfect pitch mostly. Learning perfect pitch is even more on fire here online than irl and started to just dyor and find studies. Didn't know there was actual research that teaches perfect pitch to adults until that.

Down side of harmoniq I think is it only uses piano timbre. Now I know the research the studies used lots of timbres I think it probably works better if they add that. Still worked for me tho with everything I did.

Thought about this a lot obv... If you think you can't learn you just find out you're right... can't explain that but yeah. So I think the main thing was being convinced finally I could learn, having a training partner app that knows what to do to learn, and practicing outside the app. I think you have to want it if you're gonna learn and it prob will get easier now that there's more to go on researchwise.",1,1757302906.0,perfectpitchgang,0,1.0,False

I've (40M) have been dating a girl (35F) for about a month but we've been talking for a few months. We met on Bumble and hit it off and moved to IG pretty much immediately. We both have busy schedules and failed to meet for a first date twice. I figured it wasn't meant to be and left it at that. Fast forward a month later she reached out to me out of the blue apologizing as she has been busy trying to start a new business which takes a lot of her time. I'm also pretty busy, but I'm not fool and figured she might have been dating someone and it didn't work out. I asked her if she was looking for something casual since she was busy with her job and trying to get a business going. She said she was looking for a seriousnl relationship and didn't have time to waste on something casual. That got me excited and decided to forward. We scheduled a first date and had a short video the day before our date just to make sure we were both legit. 

First date went well and had great connection and chemistry. We scheduled a 2nd date right way and things were going great. Talked daily, sending memes back n forth and daily flirting, etc. so a couple days before our second date we planned to talk on the phone for a bit to catch up and she rescheduled the call. We got in touch and then again she wanted to reschedule our second date. Just a time change, but I let her know that I valued and preferred consistency and we didn't necessarily have to see each other often but preferred to make solid plans. She agreed and scheduled again which luckily I managed to be able to keep as well so we made it work. I was thinking she was not feeling it but our second date went incredibly well. Made an even better connection and we got a lot closer and felt things moving in the right direction. 

Here's where things spiked up and we couldn't wait to see each other so we had a few video calls during the week trying to set up a 3rd date. Was a very busy week for both of us during Labor Day weekend but we managed to schedule a date on Labor Day for a quick coffee since she had work that day. We talked about events happening in the city that we wanted to go in the middle of September and to free up more time to see each other. Date ended and that night I just texted her asking how her day went and if she got home ok. No response. Cool...

Next day, nothing. I didn't pay mind as I just figured she's busy as usual and I had a rough week as well, but what I did notice is that she kept posting things about her day and stories on IG knowing damn well I'd see that as we both follow each other. She stopped looking at my IG a couple days also. I've never really paid attention to that sort of stuff before, but its pretty damn frustrating knowing she read my msg and just completely ignored it while still maintaining an online presence. Tomorrow will be a week with no response and I've never been one to double text and I just don't even know what the hell to do. It's a complete shift from how things were going to going completely cold out of nowhere. Went from sending voice msgs, memes, and maintaining pretty solid communication to all of a sudden frozen cold. What gives? Both adults and if she's not feeling it anymore why not just fucking say it?! Idk if I'm overthinking or if she wants me to chase, but I've never been one to chase. In fact, how this all started after I had moved on was HER chasing me and telling me she wanted a serious relationship, only to ghost me after investing my time and feelings on her. Not gonna lie, this shit hurts but why do women play these games at the adult age of 35?! Am I missing something or is dating just really this horrendous in 2025? Just venting, but if someone has a similar story or can read this situation better I'd love to hear your thoughts.",0,1757302872.0,dating,13,0.42,False

My grandparents see us every so often (my dads parents) and usually my aunts and uncle are there. My aunt got married last year, and me and my sister (she's 13) heard them talking about how my mom left early and it was rude, but I don't think we were!

My parents got divorced a year ago, and were on/off. During the time of the wedding (February), they were off, so we barely spoke to my dad. (He cheated, I caught him, he got mad, blah blah). Because of this, they weren't on speaking terms. We get to the wedding, and we have to sit with the general crowd instead of the family section. My mom thought it was weird, but oh well. Okay, then we go to the little after party thing (idk what it's called) and we're seated like FAR away from our family. Tables 1-3 were for immediate family, and we were table 17 or 20 i dont really remember

My mom was weirded out, and when going to ask why we can't sit there, my aunt (who I'll call Stacy because it sounds like her real name), said it's to 'not cause tension'. My mom was just confused, because she just asked to sit at one of the tables, not one my dad was at. And either way, it wouldn't be awkward because they weren't officially divorced (yet) and still talked on occasion! She was being iffy abt it and stuff. Then, they announce how immediate family get plates first, and it went by TABLE NUMBER. Who does that hello?? It was the afternoon (2ish I think), and none of us had eaten because we had to drive all this way out for the wedding meaning we had to leave the house early

My mom doesn't say anything else about it even though I tell her to, and we just go get coffee (they had a station), and while we're in line, she just starts tearing up. My uncle teeth (fake name obvi) comes up to us and asks what's wrong. He tries to console her, and offer his seat, but my mom literally had enough and we leave. Then people have the audacity to text her like... And then an ENTIRE YEAR LATER, are still talking about her

I wanted to mention my mom got pregnant at 18 and had me at 19 (my dad was 19, then 20) so they've always been weird towards her. When I say always, I literally mean ALWAYS. idc if my mom was 'weird' for leaving early, they brought it up a year later! If they had a problem they'd say it to HER, so they can suck it

First, let me just say: you are talented, gorgeous, and absolutely crushing life. But, girl… your Instagram story dragging “creepy comments” on haul and swimsuit videos? That’s like Starbucks complaining people only come in for the coffee.

Here’s the cold brew truth: your regular content does fine. Cute acoustic songs, daily life stuff—pulling in a respectable 12k to 25k views. *applause* But then… you drop a haul and suddenly we’re looking at 40k, 80k, 100k+. That’s not a coincidence. That’s data. That’s the algorithm grabbing your hand, spinning you around, and whispering, “Give the people what they want.”
Case in point: your recent haul? 88k views with 3,500 likes in less than 48 hours. Meanwhile, your last post at Bear Lake? 3,400 likes in three weeks. That’s not a viewership gap—that’s a canyon. Indiana Jones would need a rope bridge to cross it.

Let’s dive into the data a little deeper… surely something recent has had 88k views right? Nope! In fact I had to go back to April 9th, 2024 which is 1 year, 4 months, and 30 days to see a video top the most recent reel. This video grabbed 107k views. On what? Oh, right. Another swimsuit haul. At this point, your hauls aren’t just outperforming—they’re lapping the field, grabbing a protein shake, and still winning by a mile. At this point they are currency and you own the damn mint. 

Look, no one is saying you should put up with gross comments. Block, delete, karate-chop with the ban hammer—go wild. But maybe also lean into what’s working. Maybe even monetize the attention. Because if the internet has taught us anything, it’s this: people will scroll past motivational quotes, cooking hacks, and inspirational sunsets… but they’ll sprint like Usain Bolt to watch a try-on haul.

So, Tiffany, don’t fight it. Own it. You’re not just an influencer. You’re the CEO of Try-on-Hauls —and business is booming.

1nbdcpn,https://i.redd.it/fzhj82mu2vnf1.jpeg,✨🎮 Upgrade Your Eye Stats! 🎮✨,"Your eyes are your real-life HUD (Heads-Up Display) — protect them like rare gear.

Here’s your Daily Quest Log:

**🕒 20/20/20 Buff**

Every 20 minutes of screen time, shift your gaze to something 20 feet away for 20 seconds. This isn’t just some casual advice, it’s a critical buff that prevents the dreaded Screen Fatigue Debuff that stacks over time and absolutely tanks your performance.

  
**🌄 Eagle Vision Training**

Step outside every hour for 5 minutes (take a walk). Focus on near objects (3-6 feet), then mid-range (20-30 feet), then far distances (horizon), taking in the panoramic view. This trains your eyes’ autofocus system and reduces eye strain from fixed-distance screen viewing.

  
**💧 Stay Hydrated**

Keep water at hand; add a pinch of sea salt to assist absorption. If your eyes feel tired, you might just be dehydrated. Coffee and energy drinks actually dehydrate you more, so balance each one with extra water. Your tear film is literally your eyes’ shield.



**⚔️ Eye Workouts**



**1️⃣ Roll Your Eyes (XP Boost)**

🔹 Slowly roll eyes clockwise & counterclockwise (5–10 each way).

🎮 Think of it as grinding XP for flexibility.



**2️⃣ Finger-Focus Drills (Target Lock Practice)**

🔹 Hold finger/pen \~20–30 cm from your nose.

🔹 Focus near → then far. Repeat 10x.

🎯 Train fast focus switching like in-game target locks.



**3️⃣ Blink Often (Mana Restore)**

🔹 Blink 10–15 times every 20 minutes.

🔹 Try “slow blinks”: close eyes for 2–3 sec, then open.

💧 Each blink = restoring mana to your natural tear shield.



**🍃 Potion Ingredients (Eye Buff Foods)**

🥩 Beef → Zinc for Vitamin A transport.

🥚 Eggs → Lutein + zeaxanthin powerhouse.

🫐 Blueberries/blackberries → Night vision & anti-fatigue.

🥬 Leafy greens → Blue light defense.

🥕 Carrots → Beta-carotene for night vision.

🐟 Salmon/fish → Omega-3s for dry eyes & retina health.



**🚫 Foods to Limit (Debuffs):**

❌ Processed meats (sodium ↑ blood pressure)

❌ Sugary foods/drinks (diabetes risk)

❌ Trans fats (inflammation)

❌ Excess alcohol (B-vitamin drain)



**💀 Vision Debuffs to Avoid**

⚠️ High blood pressure

⚠️ High sugar/diabetes

⚠️ Smoking 🚬

⚠️ Poor sleep

⚠️ Excessive screen time



**👑 Pro Tip:**

This is a relatively new dental practice for me (just had my 3rd visit) because I moved pretty recently. They apparently had a new dentist join the practice. He made me wait for about an hour after the hygienist had finishing cleaning my teeth, and then looked at my teeth for maybe 2 minutes. He did not look at the X-rays that they had taken that day. He said that one of my back molars is slightly pitted and sticky on the side and recommended a filling. He tried to show me with a mirror, but I saw no difference between the two molars. I tried to make an appointment, but had a hard time finding a date and eventually decided to go home and call back.

Having now gotten home, I’m a little more suspicious. While I was in grad school, another dentist told me that I had a cavity (different tooth). She was extremely high pressure about booking an appt and I got bad vibes. When I went to visit my parents, I visited a dentist there who said I absolutely did not have a cavity. I am wondering if a similar situation is now occurring with this new dentist. Should I seek a 2nd opinion again this time? I could also ask for the X-rays and post them here.

For reference, I am 28 and do not drink or smoke. I do drink coffee. I have never had a cavity or a filling. I do not particularly enjoy sugar and don’t drink soda etc. I get my teeth cleaned twice a year. I’m pretty rigorous about brushing and flossing.",1,1757302464.0,askdentists,1,1.0,False

1nbd8br,https://www.reddit.com/r/Hot_Romance_Stories/comments/1nbd8br/heartbreak_billionaire_he_should_never_have_let_go/,Heartbreak Billionaire: He Should Never Have Let Go,"The first thing Seraphina did after her hearing returned was to share the good news with her fiancé, Zane Miller. She rushed to his company, eager to tell him. She could already imagine his joyful reaction and had even planned which restaurant to celebrate at. But outside his office door, she overheard him discussing with friends how wild a man could get.

Zane didn't know she was outside, nor that her hearing had returned. He said, ""I've been keeping a mistress behind my fiancée's back… I even have a hotel room booked with her today. My fiancée can't hear, so I flirt with the mistress right in front of her.""

Zane's words pierced Seraphina's ears, leaving her mind blank and her blood running cold.

His friends in the office gasped in admiration, praising Zane for being impressive. Sitting in his office, Zane smiled at their compliments. Just as he raised his glass to toast, he noticed Seraphina standing at the door. His face paled, but then he remembered she couldn't hear and quickly composed himself. Putting down his glass, he walked to the door and said to Seraphina, ""Why did you come here by yourself? I was supposed to pick you up for the wedding dress fitting. Why didn't you reply to my messages? I was so worried something had happened to you.""



He signed to her, his face full of genuine concern. She remembered how, at eighteen, Zane had fallen in love with her at first sight and pursued her passionately for two years. He sent flowers, bags, and jewelry, checked on her daily, and surprised her with creative gifts for every holiday and birthday. When her adoptive parents passed away, he stayed by her side, caring for her and helping her through her darkest moments. After his 520th confession, she finally agreed to be with him.



Three years ago, she lost her hearing while saving Zane. Devastated, she tried to break up with him multiple times. But Zane refused, begging her not to leave him, holding her tightly. He even learned sign language for her, staying with her through her pain and frustration. When the Miller family strongly opposed their relationship, he knelt in a storm for three days and nights, refusing to eat. His father, Derek, beat him severely, leaving him with broken ribs. He was hospitalized, unconscious, and couldn't leave his bed for three months. Before passing out, he insisted he would cut ties with the Miller family if they didn't accept Seraphina. Derek finally relented.



Seraphina cried and held him, asking why he was so foolish. Zane simply wiped her tears and gently signed ""I love you."" When he proposed, he went all out, organizing a grand proposal in a castle filled with her favorite pink roses and presenting her with the ""Heart of True Love,"" a billion-dollar diamond ring once owned by European royalty. The usually decisive businessman trembled with nervousness, his eyes red, terrified she might say no. When she said ""I do,"" he jumped for joy, tears streaming down his face—something he never did—and held her tightly, like a child who had finally received his most cherished toy.



The day after their engagement, she was accidentally bumped and hit her head while out. Miraculously, her hearing returned. After hospital tests confirmed she was fully recovered, Seraphina was overjoyed. She thought her life was already perfect with Zane's love, but now her injury was healed too. She wanted to share the news with him, only to discover he had been keeping a mistress. No wonder he had been frequently working late for the past month, claiming the company was busy. Turns out, he was busy with another woman. He had promised never to betray her. How could his heart stray so quickly? She didn't understand, but she knew their relationship was broken, and he had changed.



Snapping back to reality, Seraphina watched as Zane continued signing, ""Were you too excited to see the wedding dress and couldn't wait for me to pick you up?""



After their engagement, Zane was eager to start their life together and fulfill his dream of marrying her. Their wedding was set for a month later. But Seraphina knew there would be no wedding. From the moment he cheated, she had decided to leave him.

\## Chapter 2



Not wanting Zane to know that her hearing had returned, Seraphina gave a slight nod. Seeing her response, Zane breathed a sigh of relief. Even though he knew Seraphina couldn't hear, he was still worried his friends might cause trouble, so he held her hand and led her out of the office. He continued signing to her: ""Let's go, I'll take you to see the wedding dresses now…""



When they reached the Maybach parked downstairs, Zane was about to open the passenger door for her. But Seraphina saw that the seat which should have been hers was already occupied by a bright and beautiful girl. Seraphina recognized her—Mia, Zane's junior from college, who had returned from abroad not long ago.



Zane was also taken aback when he saw the girl in the passenger seat, then remembered he had made plans with Mia to check into a hotel and have sex today. He had thought Mia would arrive later, but she had come early. Though embarrassed, Zane braced himself and explained to Seraphina: ""Mia is also going to the bridal shop, so I'm giving her a ride since it's on the way…""



""Is she getting engaged too?"" Seraphina signed to Zane.



Before Zane could respond, Mia nodded and spoke while glancing at Zane, ""Yes, I'm getting engaged too…""



As soon as she said it, Zane's expression became subtly uneasy. He pretended to check his watch casually and said to Seraphina, ""It's getting late, let's hurry to the bridal shop."" Then, as if remembering something, he pointed at Mia and cautiously signed to Seraphina, ""Mia gets carsick, so she's sitting here for now. Is that okay?""



Seraphina remembered Zane once saying that only she had the right to sit in the passenger seat—anyone else who tried would be ruthlessly told to move. It seemed she was no longer his only exception. Seraphina nodded indifferently and got into the back seat.



As the car started, the two in the front, knowing Seraphina couldn't hear, chatted and laughed freely. ""Zane, the food at Moon Restaurant yesterday was delicious, though it was a bit far. Next time, I want to go there with you for a candlelit dinner,"" Mia said with a smile, glancing at Seraphina through the rear-view mirror as if silently taunting her.



""As long as you like it, we'll go no matter how far it is,"" Zane replied, chuckling lightly as he held the steering wheel.



""I knew you'd spoil me the most!"" Mia's eyes brimmed with a spoiled smile, like a pampered little girl.



In the past, Seraphina would have simply thought they were making casual conversation and nothing more. But now, with her hearing restored, she could hear every word clearly. They spoke recklessly in front of her, thinking she was completely unaware. Each word felt like a knife slicing through her heart. Especially since Moon Restaurant was a recently popular spot for couples. Just two weeks ago, she had mentioned wanting to go, but Zane said he was too busy and would take her another day.



After that, he never brought it up again. He had no time for her, yet he found time to go with Mia. No wonder the man who used to insist on sharing three meals a day with her now always claimed he was tied up with clients. It turned out the one he was tied up with was someone else. A breeze blew through the car window, but Seraphina only found it irritating.



An hour later, the car stopped at the bridal shop. Inside, the staff stood in a row, proudly displaying one hundred latest high-end wedding dresses. Zane's gaze was tender and doting as he signed to Seraphina, ""Which designer do you like? I'll have them fly over for a custom fitting. Seraphina, I'll make sure you have the most beautiful wedding dress in the world and become the most beautiful bride.""



As soon as he finished speaking, a nearby staff member sighed enviously, ""Ms. Seraphina is so lucky. We've seen so many couples, but only Mr. Zane remembers Ms. Seraphina's favorite styles and exact measurements.""



After seven years together, he indeed knew everything about her. Whether it was her clothing size or the dates of her period, he remembered them better than she did. But while others saw their relationship as perfect, only she knew how rotten it was behind the scenes. Seraphina listlessly pointed at a mermaid-style wedding dress and walked into the fitting room.



Looking at herself in the mirror, she realized that since losing her adoptive parents, her greatest wish had been to build a happy family with him. Once, she had dreamed of wearing a pure, sacred wedding dress to marry Zane. Now, she felt nothing but disappointment and heartbreak.



Just as she was about to step out, she heard Mia's voice from outside. ""Zane, you tore my lingerie last time. I bought a new one in your favorite black lace. Come to my place at 8 tonight,"" Mia said in a seductive, coquettish voice, her hand brushing against his chest.



""Seraphina is still inside. Don't mess around.""



""What are you afraid of? The staff went to get coffee, and she can't hear anyway. Or… don't you want to?"" Mia's tone was lingering and charming, tantalizingly playful.



Zane chuckled softly and kissed her. ""You're such a minx, but I still prefer you without any clothes on.""



""You're so bad.""



Their flirtatious laughter echoed outside. Seraphina realized this must have happened countless times right under her nose, while she remained clueless like a fool. She suddenly felt nauseous and couldn't stay any longer. After hurriedly changing out of the wedding dress, she stepped out, her face pale.



Zane immediately stood up, looking tense and worried. He approached her and signed, ""Seraphina, what's wrong? Are you feeling unwell? Is it your stomach acting up? Let me take you home.""

\## Chapter 3



With that, he carried her out, ignoring Mia calling his name from behind. Back at their villa, Zane busied himself finding medicine for her and cooking porridge. Watching him hustle back and forth, Seraphina felt a mix of emotions. He used to be a wealthy young master who never lifted a finger—meals were served and clothes were handed to him. But after being with her, he stepped down from his pedestal, doing laundry, cooking, and handling all the household chores, becoming a homemaker. When she lost her hearing, he even learned sign language just to communicate with her. His friends often teased him for being ""whipped,"" but he didn't mind—in fact, he took pride in it, saying he found fulfillment in loving and caring for his woman. After she developed stomach issues, he meticulously studied various stomach-friendly recipes. Distrusting hired help, he personally cooked all three meals daily, insisting on nursing her back to health. He had once loved her so deeply. Yet now, he was cheating behind her back. The thought pierced her heart—his love truly was fleeting.



After finishing the porridge, she slept for a while and woke up close to 8 p.m. Zane had been staying by her side the whole time, ready to attend to her if she felt unwell. Seeing her awake, he immediately brought her a glass of warm water and thoughtfully helped her drink. Just as he was about to say something, his phone rang.



""Mia, don't worry, I'm about to leave. Be good, wait for me after you've showered,"" he answered the phone, turning away from her, his voice filled with clear delight.



Seraphina watched him, her heart aching. She couldn't help wondering how many times he had shown her utmost care one moment and flirted freely with Mia the next, right in front of her. Who truly mattered more to him? In that moment, Seraphina desperately wanted to know his answer. So, she tugged at his sleeve and spoke, ""Zane, stay with me tonight, okay?""



Zane smiled affectionately, stroked her hair, and signed, ""Be a good girl, my company has urgent matters. A client really needs me. I'll come back to you as soon as I'm done. Message me if you need anything."" With that, he put on his coat and left.



Seraphina's heart instantly turned cold. In the past, he would cancel billion-dollar business deals without hesitation just to stay with her if she asked. But now, he could easily abandon her for another woman. Fine—then she didn't want him either. She dug out the long-unused contact of her biological parents and called them. After the call, Seraphina browsed online to learn about life in the UK, familiarizing herself with the place she would soon call home. Just then, Zane unexpectedly called.



She was deeply surprised—since she lost her hearing, Zane had never called her, afraid it would upset her. Puzzled, she answered, only to hear unmistakable, breathy moans.



""Zane, who makes you feel better—me or Seraphina?"" Mia's seductive, silky voice came through.



""Of course, it's you,"" Zane replied without hesitation, his voice low and breathy.



""I knew you still preferred me. After all, you said she's like a dead fish in bed—so boring. Zane, only we are truly compatible. Only I can give you the most pleasure.""



""Yes, you're such a demanding little minx. Why do you keep bringing her up today? You… how did you call Seraphina!?"" Zane's voice suddenly rose, tinged with tension and anger.



""She can't hear. Doesn't that make it more exciting?""



Right after, the call ended abruptly. Seraphina gripped her phone tightly, her knuckles turning white. Even wrapped in blankets, she felt an unprecedented chill. It was utterly ridiculous—the pain she had endured for him had become a tool for their thrilling affair.



Zane returned the next morning. As usual, he leaned in to give her a good morning kiss. She subtly avoided it, disgusted by the thought that those same lips had kissed another woman just hours before. Zane paused, about to ask what was wrong, when Seraphina wrinkled her nose and said, ""You didn't change clothes. You smell."" The mix of sex and strong perfume made her nauseous.



He suddenly understood and smiled, signing, ""I was negotiating with a client too late last night and fell asleep at the office. I even accidentally called you."" He was lying about what happened.



Seraphina didn't care anymore. Since she was leaving soon, she couldn't be bothered to expose him. At the breakfast table, he had bought the sandwiches Seraphina used to love. But she had no appetite. The shop was in the opposite direction of his company—but near Mia's place. Earlier that morning, she had seen Mia's post: a picture of sandwiches from that very shop, captioned, ""If I like it, he's willing to queue for two hours without complaint!""



Zane had quickly liked the post. Many comments asked if he was her boyfriend; Mia replied with a coy emoji. One photo showed a man feeding her—though his face wasn't visible, his slender fingers had a crescent-shaped scar identical to Zane's. It was a burn mark he got while learning to cook for Seraphina.



""Don't feel like eating? What would you like instead? I'll make it for you right away. Have some milk first—it's good for your stomach,"" Zane said, noticing her lack of appetite, and thoughtfully went to warm some milk for her.



""I'm not hungry. It's fine. I'm going to the studio,"" Seraphina declined flatly and took a taxi to her workshop.



She had loved painting since childhood and opened her own studio after graduation. At noon, after finishing her last painting and thinking about her impending departure, she decided to sell the studio. She found a previous agent on her phone and sent a voice message: ""Hello, I'd like to transfer my shop space. Ideally within this month.""



As soon as she finished speaking, Zane appeared at the door, frowning slightly with a puzzled expression. ""Transfer? Why would you transfer?""

\## Chapter 4



Realizing she couldn't hear him, he repeated the question using sign language. Seraphina replied casually, ""I plan to move elsewhere, so I'm selling this place.""



Zane's expression relaxed, and he put on his usual doting smile. ""It's about time you moved. With your talent, you deserve a bigger space. Just focus on your painting—leave it to me to find you the largest and best studio. You don't need to worry about such trivial things.""



Seraphina said nothing. She was indeed moving, but not staying here—she was going abroad. ""Why are you here?"" she asked.



He hadn't been to her studio once since Mia came back.



""You mentioned wanting to go to that couples' restaurant before, right? I happen to have time at noon, so I came to pick you up.""



His face was gentle as he reached out to hold Seraphina's hand. She pulled her hand back subtly and tidied up her painting tools. She had wanted to refuse, but since she was quite hungry, she nodded in agreement.



As soon as they sat down, a waiter approached warmly and asked politely, ""Mr. Zane, will you and your girlfriend order the steak couples' meal again today? We just received a fresh batch of air-freighted steak.""



Zane's hand froze for a moment, and a hint of guilt flashed across his face. He glanced at Seraphina subconsciously—she was still looking down at the menu, seemingly not paying attention. Only then did Zane take over, ordering a few dishes skillfully, all of which were her favorites. He even specially told the waiter to cook the steak to medium-well, just the way Seraphina liked it. The waiter's familiarity with him made Seraphina realize they must have been here more than once.



While waiting for the food, she didn't want to talk much to him, so she excused herself to go to the restroom. When she came back, she saw a waiter holding a bottle of red wine and saying to Zane, ""Mr. Zane, to celebrate you and your girlfriend having dined here 99 times, our restaurant specially gives you this bottle of red wine. Wish you a pleasant meal together.""



Zane looked past the waiter and saw Seraphina, whose face was expressionless. Even though he knew she couldn't hear, he still felt flustered instinctively. He forced a calm expression, waved the waiter away, and said nothing more.



Seraphina sat down, glanced at the red wine, and asked on purpose, ""I don't like red wine, and you can't drink since you're driving. Why did you order this?""



Zane forced a smile and signed, ""I didn't order it—it's a gift from the restaurant.""



Seraphina let out a cold ""Oh"" and said no more. So all those days he claimed to be dining with clients, he had actually been eating with Mia here.



When all the dishes were served, Zane took the initiative to cut the steak into small pieces to make it easier for her to eat, then gently handed the plate to her. He kept picking food for her and asking if it suited her taste, as if afraid she wouldn't enjoy the meal. Seraphina only responded with perfunctory answers.



Zane watched her carefully. In the past, she would take photos of every dish she ate and post photos of them together. But this time, she did none of that—she just ate quietly with a plain look on her face. This made him feel an indescribable sense of unease.



""Is the food not good?"" he asked with sign language.



She shook her head. ""It's fine.""



The food here was good—it was just that \*someone\* had spoiled her appetite.

\## Chapter 5



Seraphina finished her meal in a hurry and said she wanted to go home. In the car, she stared idly at the scenery outside the window. Zane's phone rang—he glanced at it and hung up quickly. But the caller kept dialing relentlessly. After hanging up three or four times, he finally answered.



Mia's sweet, coquettish voice filled the car. ""Zane, I'm in your office at the company. Hurry over to see me.""



Even though he thought Seraphina couldn't hear, he still lowered his voice. ""What are you doing in my office?""



""We've tried the bedroom, kitchen, bathroom, living room, and the car. Didn't you say you wanted to try the office too? I'm here to make your wish come true. I even wore a business suit today, and that set of underwear you like. You have half an hour to get back—otherwise, I won't wait for you anymore\~ I'll find someone else instead\~"" Her voice was so seductive that it made one's bones tingle.



Zane's expression changed slightly; his eyes darkened. As if thinking of something, he swallowed hard, his Adam's apple bobbing. ""How dare you, you little vixen. You're my woman. Wait for me—I'll come back right now and teach you a lesson.""



After being together for so many years, he had always been gentle with Seraphina in such matters, taking care of her feelings in every way. She had never known he was someone who craved excitement like this.



Zane hung up the phone immediately, pulled over to the side of the road, and signed to Seraphina. ""I'm sorry, baby. There's an urgent matter at the company, and I need to go back right away. Can you take a taxi here?""



He looked apologetic, not noticing at all that Seraphina's fists were already tightly clenched. This was a remote area, and it was hard to get a taxi. Yet he was abandoning her here for another woman.



Seraphina stared at him calmly and said slowly, ""Coincidentally, I have something to do near your company. We might as well go together.""



Zane froze for a moment; a flash of panic crossed his eyes, but he still kept driving. When they reached the bottom of his company building, Seraphina spoke again, ""I haven't been to your company in a long time. I might as well take a look today.""



Zane's face changed instantly, and his hands trembled a little as he signed. ""I'll be really busy later. I'm afraid I won't have time to show you around. Let me take you personally another day.""



She smiled. ""I can just look around on my own. You go about your business.""



Zane couldn't think of a reason to refuse, so he had to take her up to the company. The whole way, his face was filled with anxiety, and his eyes wandered restlessly.



Seraphina followed him into the office. As soon as the door opened, a small figure pounced on him. ""Zane, I've been waiting for you so long—I missed you so much!""



Zane pushed the person in his arms away abruptly, his face turning pale and then flushed. Mia was about to pout and complain when she saw Seraphina standing beside him. A look of displeasure flashed in her eyes, and she muttered, ""Zane, why did you bring her here? I was all ready, and now you've ruined the mood!""



""Stop talking. Wait until I send her away. Be good and don't cause trouble—I'll reward you later.""



Seraphina turned her head slightly to look at Zane, her expression unchanged. ""What were you saying to her?""



Zane quickly signed to her, explaining, ""She just happened to pass by and said she hadn't seen me in a long time, so she dropped by to visit. You know she's used to being warm and affectionate since she came back from abroad—don't take that hug to heart.""

6

\## Chapter 6



Seraphina certainly knew Mia had always been affectionate toward Zane. When she had gone to the airport with Zane to pick Mia up, Mia had hugged and even kissed him, claiming it was a common greeting custom abroad. Though Seraphina had found it awkward, she hadn't thought much of it. It wasn't until later, at several gatherings, that Mia's physical contact with Zane crossed the line of mere friendship—she drank from his glass, ate food from his bowl, often touched his hands and feet, and kept leaning against him.



Back then, Zane always spoke firmly and kept a proper distance from Mia, acting with good sense of boundaries. So Seraphina had never suspected there was anything between them. Little did she know they had already slept together in private.



Seraphina's expression remained calm as she nodded. ""Then I'll head back first.""



Zane eagerly walked her down to the lobby and hailed a taxi for her. As soon as she got in the car, Seraphina clearly saw him rush into the company building in a hurry through the rear-view mirror. She couldn't help but curl her lips into a sarcastic smile—he was really in such a rush.



When she returned to the villa, Seraphina went to the studio on the first floor. The room was filled with portraits of Zane. During the early days of their intense romance, he had been her exclusive model; she loved painting him, and every piece was filled with the deep affection she felt at the time. The largest painting in the center was a portrait of them together—back when they were young, leaning against each other, their eyes only for one another. But now, there were already more people in his heart than just her.



Sand that can't be held should be let go; someone who has changed their heart should be cast aside. Without hesitation, she carried all the portraits of Zane to the garden and threw them directly into the fire pit. Bright red flames quickly devoured the thin paper, burning away the affection she had once felt for Zane. In the end, she also threw in the portrait of the two of them.



""Seraphina, what are you doing?"" Zane had come back without her noticing. When he saw she was burning their paintings, he rushed over without a second thought, risking the fire to rescue one of the artworks. But no matter how fast he was, he couldn't outrun the flames—only the half of the painting with his own image was left unburned.



She looked at the man in front of her calmly and said, ""These paintings have gone bad from being stored for too long, so I'm burning them."" Just like him—he had ""gone bad"" too, and she didn't want him anymore.



Zane endured the stinging pain of his red, scalded hands and signed, ""Even so, you can't burn them! Didn't you say this was your favorite painting?""



A faint glint flickered in Seraphina's eyes. It had been her favorite once, but now it was nothing more than an eyesore. She said nothing, just stared firmly at him. She couldn't understand what he was clinging to—he was already with another woman, so why was he risking burns to save these paintings?



Zane probably thought she was going to get angry, so his expression softened, and he spoke earnestly. ""Don't do this again, okay? These paintings represent your love for me. It hurts me when you throw them away."" His face showed unhidden sadness, and there was even a hint of panic in his heart.



Seraphina nodded indifferently. There would be no ""next time."" She would paint new works in the future, but they would have nothing to do with him anymore.

\## Chapter 7



When Seraphina woke up in the morning, Zane brought her a shimmering red dress. ""Baby, there's the company anniversary gala tonight. Try this dress I specially ordered for you from a famous foreign designer."" Only then did she remember there was indeed such an event, but she felt no enthusiasm for it. She was about to refuse, but he didn't give her a chance—his phone rang. While answering the call, he signed to her, ""There's something urgent at the company. I'll come back to pick you up tonight.""



With that, he hurried out the door. When Zane returned to the villa to pick her up, he had already changed into a suit. Seeing Seraphina in the dress, his face lit up with amazement and delight. ""Baby, you're the most beautiful woman in the world. Look—my tie today is specially chosen to match your red dress; we're wearing couple outfits."" He gestured at Seraphina.



But she just gave it a quick glance and said nothing. When they arrived at the banquet hall, she didn't want to accompany Zane to socialize, so she made an excuse about wanting to get something to eat and walked to a corner.



Mia came over with a few of her girlfriends. Tonight, Mia was wearing a gold halter-neck midi dress with cut-outs on the front and back, showing off her impressive curves and fair back—sexy and charming. She had turned heads all the way over. When Mia saw Seraphina, she just gave her a cold, sideways glance and didn't greet her.



""Mia, why are you dressed so sexily today? So many men are staring at you—aren't you afraid Zane will get jealous?"" one of her girlfriends asked with a smile.



""Zane spent the whole day helping me pick out clothes, and he insisted I wear this one. He said it's easy to take off at night and makes him feel desire,"" Mia said, curving her lips proudly and glancing at Seraphina intentionally.



""I told you Zane likes you the most—he just pities that deaf woman. Win him over soon and get rid of that bitch,"" another girlfriend added.



""I will win Zane over, sooner or later,"" Mia replied confidently.



Her girlfriend covered her mouth and giggled artificially, then raised an eyebrow at Seraphina. ""That deaf woman is so stupid. We're talking about her right to her face and she has no idea. I bet she's still daydreaming about marrying into a wealthy family.""



At this, the group broke into mocking laughter.



Zane happened to be free then. He pulled Seraphina over to greet those friends. One of his buddies joked teasingly, ""Zane, you're so lucky. Mia has such a great figure—if she were mine, I'd never let anyone else see her.""



""We can only look, but you get to see and touch her too,"" another friend said.



Everyone burst into laughter. Mia looked shy, her eyes full of charm as she glanced at Zane, who was smiling. Everyone looked back and forth between the two with knowing expressions.



Seraphina had thought their relationship was a secret, but it turned out everyone around them knew. She was the only one kept in the dark, a fool being laughed at. If she hadn't regained her hearing, she wondered how long she would have been cheated—maybe even until their wedding, she would never have known her husband-to-be had already cheated on her! Beneath her calm face, her heart felt icy cold.



Zane still kept a calm expression, as if they weren't talking about him. But when he spoke, his tone carried a clear, heavy sense of authority. ""I told you not to talk about this in front of Seraphina. If she finds out, I'll make you regret it.""



His sharp eyes swept over the group silently. Only then did they reluctantly shut up.



But Mia looked a little unhappy. She said in a sweet, coquettish voice, ""Zane, you're being too cautious. What are you afraid of? She's just a deaf woman—she can't hear us.""



As soon as the words left her mouth, everyone's face changed. Who didn't know that Zane hated it most when people mocked Seraphina for being deaf? Anyone who dared to say such things would get beaten by him, and he would even take away their business, driving their companies to bankruptcy. Years ago, his closest friend had said something like that when he was drunk—Zane had beaten him up on the spot, leaving him bedridden for a month, and even cut off their decades-long friendship. So this was a forbidden topic in their circle. At that moment, everyone looked at each other in awkward silence. Some even tried to persuade Zane, but were pulled back by those beside them.



Seraphina waited to see how he would react. Would he still defend her without hesitation like he used to?



Zane's smile disappeared the moment he heard Mia's words, his eyes darkening. After a long pause, he finally said slowly, ""Don't say things like that again.""



He didn't lose his temper, and he didn't hit anyone. Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.



Mia was overjoyed. Zane had her in his heart—he was just confused by that orphan girl. She was sure that one day, she would replace Seraphina. They were a perfect match in terms of family background; she didn't believe she was inferior to Seraphina. So Mia took the opportunity to back down gently, saying, ""Okay, I'll listen to you.""



The atmosphere became lively again.



Seraphina held her wine glass, silently watching this farce. It turned out Mia really had a place in his heart. Zane still wanted to keep hiding it from her, not wanting this affair to be exposed. She suddenly grew curious—if he ever found out she had already regained her hearing, what kind of expression would he have? Would he still be as calm and composed as he was now?

\## Chapter 8



It was time for the speech segment of the gala. Zane gave an impassioned speech on stage, and finally invited Seraphina up. In front of thousands of guests, he began to confess his love affectionately, using both words and sign language. ""Seraphina is the love of my life—the only one. She means more to me than my own life; my life would be meaningless without her. I promise here to treat her well for the rest of my days.""



Thunderous applause erupted from the audience, and everyone looked at Seraphina with envy. But her heart remained completely untouched. She could only wonder how Zane managed to be so affectionate while lying and deceiving her. If she hadn't known the truth, she would have thought she was the happiest woman in the world, just like everyone else believed.



At that moment, Zane's gaze was intense, his eyes filled with deep, tender affection. He had expected her to smile happily or burst into tears of joy—every time he confessed his love in such a setting before, she would always lose control of her emotions, teasing him for making her cry like a mess. But this time, Seraphina only curved her lips slightly, as if smiling. Yet Zane felt an indescribable coldness in her eyes. Memories of what had happened earlier flashed through his mind, and a panic stirred in his chest.



After the banquet ended, Seraphina asked if he wanted to go back together. He smiled and was about to agree, but his gaze suddenly lingered on something for a moment. Then he signed, ""I'm sorry, but I have to stay and entertain clients tonight. You go back first—no need to wait up for me.""



Seraphina nodded indifferently and turned to get into the car. Just then, Zane grabbed her arm, his expression serious. ""After this busy period, once the wedding is over, I'll make it up to you double. I'll spend all my time with you.""



She curled her lips dismissively, gave him a meaningful look, and shut the car door firmly. Through the rear-view mirror, she saw Zane get into a red sports car. The license plate looked familiar—she had seen it in one of Mia's posts not long ago.

1nbd6n1,https://www.reddit.com/r/UIUC/comments/1nbd6n1/the_truth_about_working_at_the_dining_hall/,The Truth About Working at the Dining Hall,"As someone who has spent quite a bit of time working in the dining hall—mainly in the retail spaces as a shift lead (or, as they like to call it, *“student coordinator”*)—I feel like it’s only fair to share some honest thoughts about my experience. If you’re considering applying, my advice is simple: let the dining hall—coffee places, retail spaces, all of it—be the *last* place you apply to. There are plenty of reasons for this, but let’s start with the biggest ones.

# Sexual harassment from full-time employees

A few years ago, there was a full-time cook who made a habit of harassing female student workers. Management was notified, and to their credit, they opened an investigation. At first glance, that might sound like the university was doing the right thing. You’d probably think, “Wow, they took it seriously.” Except—wrong. What most people don’t realize is that this wasn’t the first, or even the second, time this particular cook had been investigated. This was his *third* round. The first two times, he was suspended for sexual harassment and then—because the university was desperate for full-time staff—brought right back like nothing happened. By the time the third investigation rolled around, he simply quit. So yes, technically he left, but only after the university had already shown twice that they’d rather protect their staffing levels than their student workers. If they had acted decisively the first time, none of this would have dragged on.

# Disrespect from supervisors and management

I have never felt more disrespected or unappreciated in a workplace. From the start, the attitude from certain supervisors wasn’t about teamwork—it was about hierarchy. Student workers were treated as if we were replaceable parts in a machine, not actual people keeping the place running. Being talked to in a condescending way became routine, and while I can’t say for sure if it was because I’m a woman, a minority, or just a student, the effect was the same: our contributions didn’t matter. I’ve been abandoned during rushes, left juggling new employees with no support, only for my supervisor to later shrug and say he was “too busy dealing with the full-time staff” to step in. (For reference, there was exactly *one* full-time worker on that shift—so clearly, the man was swamped.) Then there were the supervisors who openly admitted that working the line was “beneath them.” Yes, they actually said that out loud, while the rest of us were drowning in orders. It’s demoralizing when leadership makes it clear they see you as disposable labor instead of essential staff. Every shift starts to feel like a test you’re expected to pass alone, while the people above you stand back and watch.

# Not enough full-time cooks

The lack of full-time cooks is a constant problem, and of course, the burden falls squarely on student workers. Let me be clear: I don’t mind working hard. What I *do* mind is being put in situations where success is practically impossible because of poor staffing decisions. When you have lines stretching out the door in the evenings and not enough people behind the counter, the job quickly shifts from stressful to unbearable. And what makes it worse is knowing that management could fix this at any time. There are open positions they simply don’t fill, as if pretending the problem doesn’t exist will make it go away. Meanwhile, students are left scrambling, covering for the holes in a system that leadership refuses to patch. It’s not a shortage of applicants—it’s a shortage of effort from the people paid to run the place.

# Running out of product

If you’ve eaten in the retail spaces recently, you’ve probably noticed how limited the menu has become. That’s largely because there aren’t enough staff to run the fryers or the grill, which means no burgers or fried food. But it doesn’t stop there. Even the “safe bets” like pizza and quesadillas disappear as the week goes on. Why? Because the unit manager doesn’t order enough product, even after being told repeatedly how quickly we burn through it when parts of the menu are closed. By the end of the week, we’re left telling customers “sorry, we’re out” more often than we’re actually serving food. And nothing kills morale faster than being yelled at by a hungry customer for something completely out of your control, all because management couldn’t be bothered to plan ahead.

# A message to students who eat here

To those of you who frequent these dining spaces, I’d ask for just one thing: patience. Most of the issues—missing menu items, long lines, constant “sorry, we’re out”—are not the fault of student workers. We don’t control staffing levels, we don’t control supply orders, and we certainly don’t control management decisions. What we *do* control is how hard we work in the middle of all this, and believe me, most of us are doing everything we can just to keep things running. Also, remember that the students serving your food are students just like you. There’s a good chance we share classes, professors, or even group projects. So the next time you’re tempted to take your frustration out on the person behind the counter, keep in mind—they might be sitting next to you in lecture tomorrow.

# Why I’m sharing this

I’m not writing all of this just to rant—I’m writing it because these problems have been swept under the rug for too long. The more people know about what’s really going on in the dining halls, the harder it becomes for management to ignore. If you’ve had similar experiences or if this resonates with you, I encourage you to share this post. The only way things change is if more voices bring these issues to light.

\
Alt text: Business people collaborating in a modern corporate setting. and Reuters’ March 2025 market snapshot, Bahrain’s non-oil GDP jumped by 5.1% in 2024, with fintech leading the charge. The government’s vision? Make Bahrain the region’s go-to digital financial hub—and according to the Bahrain Economic Development Board, that’s not just a slogan.\
\
Over 400 fintech and blockchain firms registered by Q2 2025, with crypto-asset service providers making up 16% of new registrations.\
Foreign ownership reforms: Today, nearly all fintech fields permit 100% foreign equity (Source).\
Business setup times have shrunk by 35% since 2022, now averaging 13 working days.\
\
Surprisingly, the government continues to outpace neighbors like Dubai or Saudi with transparent licensing, clear regulatory sandboxes, and direct access to regulators. I’ve seen Sijilat system kiosks on the ground floor of the Diplomatic Area MOICT building process new crypto license paperwork in under an hour (with the right prep).\
Bahrain’s Business Structures for Crypto Ventures\
Bahrain’s regulatory framework grants flexibility. From simple single-owner setups to joint-stock vehicles ideal for international expansion, the choices are clear (entity types explained here).\
\
WLL (With Limited Liability) – Most popular for crypto startups, requiring only BHD 1,000 capital.\
BSC Closed (Bahrain Shareholding Company) – Preferred by larger fintechs and VC-backed startups.\
Branch or Representative Office – Fastest route for overseas firms (with limitations on certain crypto activities).\
\
Majlis-style networking—a uniquely personal Bahrain custom—remains the best way to get real-time insights on what regulators want. Failing to observe Ramadan business hour adjustments or mishandling initial face-to-face meetings can set you back weeks.\
\
2025 Regulatory Update: The Central Bank’s Crypto-Asset Rules\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation for crypto-asset regulations.\
The Central Bank of Bahrain (CBB) updated its Crypto-Asset Module in February 2025, effective May 1, 2025. Here’s what you must know:\
License Categories\
\
Crypto-Asset Platform Operators: Exchanges, custodians, wallet providers.\
Crypto-Asset Advisory and Brokerage Services: Consultants, OTC brokers, and on/off-ramp providers.\
Tokenization and Custody: NFT, asset-backed tokens, DeFi intermediaries.\
\
Each category has its own capital and compliance requirements.\
Core Compliance Requirements\
1. AML/CFT\
   - Full adherence to Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards.\
   - Monthly suspicious transaction reports via the CBB’s new e-filing portal.\
   - Mandatory annual staff KYC training—yes, you’ll be quizzed by the regulator.\
2. Customer Onboarding and Due Diligence\
   - Digital onboarding permitted (with biometric/2FA safeguards).\
   - Local service address required for each onboarding entity.\
   - Client asset segregation (with third-party custodial audit).\
3. Technology Governance\
   - Annual IT security audits by CBB-approved third parties.\
   - Board-level Cybersecurity Officer mandatory for platforms handling >BHD 5 million in client assets.\
   - API integration with the LMRA and Tamkeen for real-time workforce vetting (new for 2025).\
4. Ongoing Reporting and Audit\
   - Quarterly financials, annual CBB audit, mandatory tax/VAT return filings.\
   - Consumer complaint channels and dispute tracking.\
   - Real-time reporting for high-value transactions (>BHD 10,000 single transfer).\
5. Sandbox Testing Requirement\
   - All crypto startups must complete at least three months in CBB’s Regulatory Sandbox before full license issuance—no exceptions.\
Common mistake: Submitting incomplete sandbox test documentation. Double-check every API endpoint and wallet transaction before your CBB demo day. (Yes, I learned this the hard way—my team missed a required audit log and spent nine days chasing regulator sign-off.)\

Step-by-Step: Forming a Crypto-Asset Company in Bahrain (With Insider Tips)\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation for crypto company setup.)\
- Location: Free zones in Bahrain Bay or Bahrain Financial Harbour offer fintech perks, direct regulator access, and work visa flexibility (Free zones explained).\
Insider tip: Bahrain Bay’s business centers process Sijilat registration faster—queues are shorter after midday prayer and typically shortest on Thursdays.\
2. Prepare Documentation\
\
Passport and proof of address for all shareholders.\
Detailed business plan with AML/CFT procedures spelled out.\
Pro-forma financials for the first two years.\
Technology risk assessment.\
Local lease agreement (minimum 12 months, though some free zones allow shared office arrangements).\
\
Document Shortcut: Use an approved document template provider (I recommend “Legal Wise Bahrain”—their templates passed my last CBB review with zero edits needed).\
3. Submit Your Application\
\
Register on the Sijilat portal (the main hub for all company formation).\
Book a pre-clearance appointment—avoid end of month, as volumes spike.\
For foreign founders: guarantee letter for 100% foreign ownership (see full list of eligible activities; ownership policy details).\
\
4. Regulatory Sandbox Testing\
\
Complete sandbox application with CBB. Typical cycle: 3 months pilot, 2 weeks review.\
Real-use case demo required—bring live, anonymized transaction data.\
Feedback roundtable with MOICT, EDB, and, often, Tamkeen officials (majlis-style hospitality not optional—bring business cards and brush up on Arabic greetings).\
\
Challenge: My first sandbox demo flopped due to a missing staff background check. Now, I always start application work with LMRA clearances before tech buildout.\
5. Final License & Go-Live\
\
Once sandbox sign-off is granted, final CBB approval is usually less than 10 working days.\
Activate commercial registration and VAT certificate.\
Onboard staff and start trading.\
\
Process shortcut: Submit both Sijilat and CBB sandbox forms together. If you sync these, you can shave two weeks off approval time.\
\
Cost Considerations for Crypto-Asset Company Formation\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs for Bahrain crypto company setup.\
- CBB Crypto License Fees: BHD 2,000 application, then annual fees from BHD 3,000 for basic brokerage to BHD 8,000+ for exchanges/custodians\
- Regulatory Sandbox: BHD 1,250 (covers CBB processing)\
- Annual Audit & Compliance: Budget BHD 2,000–4,000 for external audit, KYC/AML training, and reporting\
- Office Rent: Minimum BHD 450/month for shared free zone desk; BHD 1,000–2,000/month for private office in Bahrain Financial Harbour or Bahrain Bay\
Check the latest fee calculators and breakdowns here.\
Tip: Book your office lease in Bahrain Bay or Seef District—these business centers have dedicated Sijilat registration counters and can handle your LMRA sponsorship paperwork, saving on lawyer fees.\
\
Practical Example: Launching a Crypto Brokerage in Bahrain Bay\
A friend’s team (I advised on this project) launched a B2B crypto brokerage in Bahrain Bay in late 2024:\
\
Chose WLL structure; three foreign founders, 100% overseas equity, local business address at a Bahrain Bay co-working hub.\
Used a template business plan and legal docs (Legal Wise).\
Applied for both Sijilat registration and sandbox approval the same week.\
Sandbox started within 14 days. Total timeline: 65 working days to license, go-live in 4 months.\
Final cost: BHD 9,450 (all fees + initial lease + audit).\
\
Their biggest hiccup? Missed the Ramadan office hour window—lost four business days. Now, they always confirm holiday schedules before scheduling regulator meetings.\
\
Ownership, Sponsorship, and Local Practices\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in Bahrain.). No mandatory local “kafeel” or sponsor for the majority of digital asset ventures (ownership explained). However, some legacy business activities still require a Bahraini partner. If you’re in legal gray areas (like proprietary crypto trading or DeFi platform), a specialist local sponsorship service can help resolve ambiguities.\
Local Customs and Networking\
\
Business meetings often begin with traditional coffee service—accept at least one cup; it’s considered polite.\
Ramadan and Eid schedules can seriously impact regulator response time—always check the official government calendar for deadlines.\
Contacts made at Tamkeen workshops or EDB seminars can yield faster internal referrals.\
\
UAE vs. Bahrain vs. Saudi: Compared to Dubai (where commercial rent and setup fees are double, and mainland licenses can require a 51% local partner), Bahrain’s digital asset formation climate is more transparent, affordable, and direct.\
\
Keeping Current: How to Handle 2025’s Regulatory Shift\
The CBB’s February 2025 update changed two things:\
- All crypto-asset licensees must now integrate with the LMRA and Tamkeen for labor compliance checks—a move unseen in the UAE.\
- Regulatory Sandbox pilot is now mandatory for every new applicant, regardless of previous licensing overseas.\
Implementation: Applies to any applicant from May 1, 2025 onward. Those in progress as of April 30 are grandfathered under old rules—but must upgrade technology protocols by January 2026.\
\
Resources and Support\
\
Alt text: Professional business support for crypto company formation.. They’re tuned in to both Bahrain VAT and CBB crypto reporting rules, cutting your risk of fines.\
Biggest mistake: Skipping the pre-clearance meeting at MOICT or not bringing Arabic-language originals. Always bring two printed document sets—one for Sijilat, one for CBB.\
\
Tangent: The Art of the Bahraini Breakfast (And Why It Matters for Compliance)\
One morning, stressed about overdue audit paperwork, I accepted a meeting at the famous Haji Gahwa downtown. Over eggs, foul medames, and endless coffee, a regulator shared key tips about the sandbox process—including a shortcut on staff onboarding that saved me a week. Not every jurisdiction builds business relationships over breakfast, but in Bahrain, breaking bread paves the way for regulatory clarity—and often, your fastest path to license approval. Lesson: never skip an invitation to breakfast. It may just be your compliance secret weapon.\
\
Bahrain Crypto-Asset Provider Compliance FAQ\
Q1: Can a foreigner own 100% of a Bahrain crypto company?\
Yes. Nearly all digital asset and fintech activities now permit full foreign ownership. Lists and guides here and here.\
Q2: What are the total setup costs for a crypto-asset company?\
Figure on BHD 9,000 to BHD 15,000 for the first year, covering all fees, lease, audit, and compliance. Fee calculator and breakdown.\
Q3: How long does it take to get licensed?\
With the 2025 sandbox rule, plan for 3–5 months, depending on your documentation and holiday periods. Step-by-step process guide.\
Q4: What compliance reports do I file after set-up?\
Quarterly financials, annual audit, ongoing AML/CFT, and—if registered for VAT—quarterly VAT returns. See full compliance list.\
Q5: Do you need a local partner or sponsor?\
Not for most fintech and crypto activities. Some edge-case categories may require a Bahraini associate, best handled via a specialist local sponsor service.\
\
Bahrain’s combination of pro-business policy, advanced regulation, and uniquely personal customs makes it the leading Gulf launchpad for crypto, blockchain, and fintech ventures. Master the compliance maze (and never turn down a breakfast meeting), and you’ll be up and trading sooner than you think.\

I am a 21 -year -old girl who likes to have fun, I love people with a good sense of humor who are able to have critical and open minds in issues of general culture and in her personal life. In physical appearance I am thin, with white skin and dark hair.

I am around three years ago I am active in a D/S relationship with my partner. I entered the world of BDSM thanks to it. The experience has been captivating, initially I did not even have the most remote idea about what this type of dynamic was dealing with, but once I immersed myself in it, I discovered a part of myself that I did not expect to meet.

Here is a list of the practices that I have tried so far (I do not remember them all haha):

\-Pet play

\-Shibari            

\-Facessiting

\-Cbt

\-Sph

\-Joi

\-Ballbusting

\-Spnak

\-Humillation

\-Sensory deprivation

\-Edging

\-Sissification (My favorite)

\-Foot worship

I still have to mention some, I will complete the list as I remember.

I am interested in trying the Findom from the dominant side, it causes me an insatiable curiosity how a transactional dynamic generates pleasure beyond money, I have had some interactions of this style without knowing it and having power over the appearance of a person seems genuinely exciting. If you are interested or have been immersed in the subject quite a long time, you can talk to me without any problem, I would love to read and learn more!

In more general tastes I enjoy anime, cosplay, sewing, crafts, erotic photography, I love the taste of coffee in all its presentations, I love food with good taste in special salt, the sweet is not my strongest point haha, read, rock/metal, I am bad for video games but I still enjoy playing, dance and my last obsession are musical and erotic theater.

I don’t see the point in having surface level relationships really. I have surface level relationships with the guy at the coffee shop, the receptionist at the gym, etc.

Hello everyone, I have some exciting personal news to share! After many months of work, I've published a coloring book for all ages: ""Ethiopia in Line Art: A Fun Coloring Journey.""

This project is deeply personal to me. Earlier this year, I found myself at a crossroads after my job in Ethiopia was terminated. During that uncertain period, I was looking for a way to make sense of my experience and reconnect with the beautiful country around me.

I was born in Addis Ababa but I left when I was 10. I’ve always been amazed by Ethiopia's rich culture, but I noticed a lack of coloring books that truly celebrated its unique heritage. So, I decided to create one. This book is the result. It was a therapeutic and fun exercise that helped me move forward. Inside, you'll find illustrations of the famous coffee ceremonies, the stunning Simien Mountains, vibrant traditional dances, and festive celebrations.

My goal was to create more than just a book; it's an invitation to explore and connect with Ethiopia. It's for families, for art lovers, and for anyone curious about Ethiopia.

It would mean so much to me if you’d take a look. It's available on Amazon now, and if you enjoy it, please consider leaving a short review.

A few minutes later his friends show up and he introduced me to 5 more guys and we all exchange socials and have a fun day.

The same day I was drinking coffee beside this guy sitting on a 4-person table by himself and a group of 3 women approach him asking if they could switch chairs with him (trading a 2 seater for his 4). He simply replied with “sure no problem but if you guys would like to join me instead I would love that”.

Absolute masterclass.

He made 3 friends and they started talking about books!

1nbctb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nbctb6/leafcutters/,Leaf-cutters,"Please please please give me feedback. I’ve never written a story, or shared one online. Also idk if there’s length restrictions on this or not, sorry. 

I used to love leaf-cutter ants. I grew up on a farm in the southern United States, and I would watch those little critters carry leaves all the way from a tree back to their colony. At the time, I didn’t know about their symbiotic relationship with certain species of fungi, but I found it intriguing nonetheless. Now, they just bring an uneasy feeling to my stomach. I ran away from that place long ago, but sometimes I still see him when I close my eyes. I still see the ants. I still see it.
	My father was a working man. A corn farmer specifically. He was certainly far from perfect, but he valued family and was an incredibly driven worker. ”Someone’s gotta do it dammit.” That was his not-so-silent mantra he would half mutter to himself over coffee every morning. Sometimes, I could swear I saw some sort of remorse in his eyes, which always confused me. Was he so concerned for the fields he would plow? Did he hold sorrow in his empty heart for the ears of corn he would husk and shill off at the next farmer’s market? Of course, I know now it’s not the field he would pre-emptively mourn.
	My mother was chronically ill. She would faint often. Her spouts were bi-polar in nature, and immensely concerning for the young boy I was. She would seem on the brink of a grisly, feverish death one night, fainting so often she was conscious as long as she was unconscious. Then she’d be as chipper as the songbirds the next morning. She had these swings constantly throughout my entire memory of her. The times she wasn’t sick were amazing. She was a wonderful mother, even though you could see the sickness gripping her measly, starved body even in her healthier moments. Her stature combined with my father’s grisly attitude made our household cold and uninviting to outsiders. We never did have many guests.
	This is how I became friends with the ants. There were a lot of species out where we lived, but my favorite was by far the leaf-cutters. My fascination grew to such extremes that it was all I would ask my science teachers at school about, all my parents would hear about when they asked what I was doing outside, and most of what I read about. My fascination with these insects was almost irrational. Oddly enough, the fascination seemed two sided. All around our little farm there were hundreds of leaf-cutter colonies. 
      They especially loved our barn. To my young mind, that made no sense. Why would these ants, who depend on leaves for existence, prefer to reside in a place with so few leaves? My father didn’t like whenever I asked him such questions. He said it was pointless to be so curious about the goings-on of bugs. He never allowed me to do my own research either, seeing as the barn was off limits. “That’s where I keep my tools ya’heer? If I catchya in there, you’ll be real sorry, boy.”
      One night I awoke to a wretched, wheezing moan coming from down the hall. It was a sound I knew all too well. My mother was sick again. This time it seemed like it might really be her last. The fever had been ravaging her for days and the nearest doctor was at least a day's ride away, if she’d even survive the ride there. I heard my father grumbling something I couldn’t make out fully before I heard their bedroom door open and then quietly shut. I watched through a crack in my door as he slowly tip-toed down the hall, a motion so unfamiliar to his large frame. He quickly glanced in my direction, and I scurried back under my sheets as carefully as I could, hoping he didn’t see me. I didn’t see anything else that night, but I could swear I heard the lock of the barn door clicking open right as I was falling asleep.
      Many of my early years passed by just so. My mother would fall ill, each time seeming to get worse. My father would grumble and head out to the barn, and then my mother would be better the next morning. In my childish view of the world, I simply assumed that my mother would only get sick at night. That all changed when I was 14 and she began getting sick during the day.
      We were out on our porch, drinking sun tea that my mother had been brewing all day, when she fainted. By this point in her life, she resembled a walking cadaver. Her skin was pulled tight against bone, her fingers resembled string beans tied loosely to marbles. I swear I could see the tendons in her flex and stretch every time she moved. Her hair had almost all fallen out, leaving nothing but a few patches, and towards the end of my time on the farm you could actually see her eyes beginning to sink into her skull. Despite all this, she only acted frail when she was sick. My father and I still loved her dearly, and I didn’t understand completely how abnormal this was.
      After I helped my father get her into bed, I watched as he spoon fed her something vile. He pulled it out of a jar labeled “emergency” from his bedside table. It resembled semi-liquified rotten meat, and did not smell much better than it looked. He seemed to have forgotten I was there. I stood and  watched as he tenderly fed her every drop on the spoon, making sure none fell to waste on the sheets below. Every loose, fleshy chunk accounted for. Every rogue hair pushed into her hinged-open jaw. Every cough covered with a napkin to prevent unnecessary loss of nourishment. My mother was dead. That’s what I realized at that moment. She should be dead, at least. Standing there, watching her be fed this unholy amalgamation, with her mouth hung open, and her body unmoving except to cough. That cough, the one I had heard my whole life. I was now seeing the origin of it, as if the very depths of her soul were rejecting the bile my father was now forcing into her. She should be dead. I slowly closed the door and walked outside.
      I didn’t get far. I found myself near the shed, entranced by a trail of leaf-cutter ants heading under the towering, locked doors. I sat there for what must have been hours, listening to that bone-shattering cough erupt from the house. The trail of ants seemed never-ending. I wonder if they felt tired? I wonder if they felt remorse each morning for the trees they would shred? I had a thought then that I had somehow never realized. The ants were trading life. They had the power to end the life of a plant, stripping it of every single leaf. They would then feed that plant to another organism. For the first time in my life I saw the ants as something other than harmless, driven workers. I slept outside that night.
      The next morning I went to confront my father. I found nobody but my mother inside.
      ”Helloooooo, son!” Her cheery voice cooed from the kitchen
      The smell of breakfast serenaded my senses. I rounded the corner to see her famished frame standing cockeyed over the burner. She beamed when I entered. Where I once saw a mother’s love, I now saw wrinkled, fragile skin pulled taught across blackened teeth. I saw bowed legs, barely holding what little weight was left above them. I saw a gut, bloated with the fumes of death, ready to be released. She looked worse now than ever. What was once excusable in my adolescent mind as a grave sickness, was now clearly something worse.
      “Where is dad?” I asked, stepping closer.
      ”Oh! He had some errands to run. He’s down in town for now, ought to be back this evening.”
I heard her voice as I always had, but the closer I got, the more I noticed a distinct, rattling raspiness. The same raspiness that I hear in our old dairy cows before they pass. My father always called it the death rattle.
      ”One second Ma, I gotta grab something from my room. I’ll be right back” I said, hurriedly leaving the kitchen.
      ”When you get back, I need you to toast the bread!” I heard her wheeze as I left the room.
      I was looking for one thing. The keyring my father keeps in his room. I needed to know what was really in our barn. I needed to know what he had been feeding the corpse of my mother to keep her alive. I rummaged as quietly as I could, anxiety gnawing at the back of my brain. I could hear my mother calling to me from down the hall, probably asking what was taking me so long. I found the keyring hidden under a book in my father’s bedside table, right next to the empty emergency jar.
      I left the room and was headed for the front door when I heard her.
      ”Son?” She said in an inquisitive, yet serious tone. “What do you have there?” She asked, eyes falling downwards in their socket to glance at the keyring in my hand.
      I began backing away, fully revealing my intentions to investigate the barn.
      ”Now you know, that barn is OFF LIMITS” she coughed up, gasping for air. “Your father would be beside himself if you ruined any of his nice equipment”
      I turned and ran out the front door. I didn’t expect my mother to run after me. I quickly made it past the porch and hopped down off the steps. I landed awkwardly and twisted my ankle. Behind me I saw the scrawny frame of my mother hobbling after me at an unnatural pace. I watched in horror as she wretched and lurched forward, so desperate to stop me from reaching the barn. So desperate to stop me from seeing whatever was in there. I crawled backwards as my mother’s corpse gained ground on me. I saw her foot land half on the first step, twisting sideways with a wet pop. She yelped and fell hard. Her attempt to catch herself on her other leg produced a louder snap and I watched as her femur snapped out from under her skin, tearing it like dry paper. The bone was beyond yellowed and nearly black with rot. She landed on her arm, and with one last crack she was settled into place on the ground.
      I began crawling backwards again, finally snapping out of my trance. I pulled myself up on a fence post, and turned again to look at my mother on the ground. I saw her lift up her arm at the shoulder, only for the tendons to snap at the elbow as her arm gave out. I watched her begin to drag herself through the grass of our front lawn. Each pull only giving her a quarter inch of progress, accompanied with cries of agony gargled up through bloodied coughs. I saw her try to dig her fingers into the dirt to gain leverage just to have the bones of her fingers crackle and snap. She reached up at me again, and everything from the elbow down hung limp and useless. She continued her desperate crawl.
I turned back towards the barn one last time. I gripped the key ring in my hand and stilled my restless nerves. It’s time to learn my family secret.
      Surprisingly, the barn looked to hold nothing of note. All I saw was sunflower-colored beams of sunlight coming through the gaps in the construction to coat the room in a natural light. But the smell was something else. A sweet smell almost, but combined with spoiled meat. It was so faint, yet it was the only thing my mind could focus on. I closed and latched the door behind me, and quickly searched for the origin.
	Minutes later I found myself standing over a hatch that was nearly perfectly aligned with the seams of the wooden floor. I had to move a few hay bales to get to it, but I found it. My ant friends led me there. Lines and lines of hundred or even thousands of leaf-cutters poured into it through the nearby seam. I prepared myself for the worst and swung it open.
	
Nothing

	Nothing that I could see at least. No ladder, no floor, no lights, just that awful smell. The smell and a faint voice repeating the same nearly silent, rattly whisper that I could never forget.
	”Pater noster, qui es in caelis, sanctificetur nomen tuum…”
	The Lord’s Prayer. At least that’s what I would come to find later. There are some denominations of Catholicism that still say the prayer in the original language. One of which was host to a religion-central group therapy session I tried to attend later in life. The words, the words that haunted my nightmares, had forced me to leave that meeting.
	I tried my best to talk myself out of doing what I was about to do. I had little success though. I needed to know what was down there. I lowered my legs down first, searching for some foothold to no success. Then I lowered myself until I was only clinging to the very edge of the hatch. When I found no footholds there either, I let go, plunging myself into the abyss held beneath the barn.
	I landed on what felt like sopping wet cobblestones. My landing was accompanied by a loud groan, but not from me. The floor itself seemed to have gotten the wind knocked out of it by my fall. There was nearly no light save what little was left above me from the hatch. I crawled along the wet stones to the edge of the wall. It had the same texture as the floor. I pulled myself upright and carefully searched for some clue, a light source, anything. I stumbled about for what felt like hours until I found it.
	I found a man. At least, it felt like a man. I still couldn’t see anything, but my other senses felt more keen in the absence of one of the five. I ran my fingers along arms covered in hair, musculature similar to my own, but of a grown adult. I could feel a face, I felt eyes and eyelashes, a head of hair, ragged clothes with many holes in it. I felt him breathing. I felt his lips moving, attempting to form words. I felt him covered in fleshy stones and leaves. There were only two conflicting points that led me to believe it may not be a man. One was that he was completely soaking wet and warm to the touch despite being unresponsive. The other was that I could not find a point at which he ended and the floor began. I ran my hands along where his body should have ended and the floor should have begun, but I found no seam. It’s as if he had sunk into the floor, as if he was being consumed by it.
	Just then, I heard the barn doors open. I heard my fathers familiar sounding footfalls rapidly approaching the place where I was now hiding. Fear gripped my stomach, whatever nerves I thought were fried beyond use were now firing again at high speed. He threw something down the hatch, and it landed next to me with a meaty thud, and the snap of bone breaking. The same gasp accompanied it as when I had landed.
	My father then stomped away from the hatch, the illogical part of my brain thinking that he somehow didn’t see my mother, mangled and crawling through the lawn. Hoped against hope that he hadn’t noticed that the hatch was already open, and that the hay bales had been moved.
	Of course, I was wrong. I knew I was wrong even before I heard the other hatch open. I heard the click of a door lock, and before I could even move I was blinded by the ruthless light of the sun. 
	“Son” I heard the deep, grisly voice of my father say. “I told you that I had better never, EVER catch you in this damn barn.” I had never heard him speak so clearly. His southern drawl was still present, but the words were spoken with a seriousness unbeknown to me my entire life.
	That’s when I saw what he had thrown in before coming down to fetch me. It was another man. He was covered in bloodied stab wounds, and his neck was bent backwards to reveal vertebrae sticking out through his neck, his head violently strewn to the side. That’s not what caught my attention though. I was more disturbed by the floor he had landed on.
	Illuminated now by the light of the open door, every inch of the room that I could see was covered in a thick, firm viscera and a thin coating of leaves. Fragments of bone were mixed into the floors and walls, calcifying the room into place, acting as a foundation for the horrid creature. That’s what it was I realized. A beast. A horrid, living, breathing beast. I saw the outline of the first man I had found, his body completely engulfed by the room, with the thinnest, most recently formed layer being over his mouth. 
	”DAD WHAT THE HELL IS THIS” I yelled at him.
	”Watch your tone boy, and your mouth.”
	“FUCK YO-“ I was cut off by him stepping forward and striking me across the face in one smooth motion.
	”I don’t need to explain myself to you son. This is the way things are, like it or not” He said plainly, walking over to the edge of the wall and cutting a piece of it off with his knife and putting it into a large bowl.
	”THIS? THIS IS WHAT YOU-“
	“I feed it. It keeps her well.” He interrupted me again, motioning me to be quiet with his hand. “You’ve seen it. I know you have. That day she fainted in front of you and I forgot to close the door. It’s just the way things are. Someone has to do it.”
	I stood there in shock, not sure what to say to my own father. Is this what he has felt remorse about each morning? How many innocent people has he fed to this monster?
	”Now son, I know this may be hard to wrap ‘yer mind round” he said, his normal drawl coming back in “but I HAVE to do this. Yer ma, she’s… she ain’t well.”
	”She’s dead, dad. She should have been dead a long time ago! This is unnatural. This isn’t right.”
	“WHO GIVES A SHIT” he said, surprisingly upset by my previous statement. “Yer mother, I love her. I NEED her, son” I saw tears beginning to form in his eyes. “Not like ya’d really understand. Don’t have a wife of ‘yer own yet.”
	”But I would never do this to her”
	”You would” He barked “Think of it like cattle, son. You feed the cow, cow grows, ya eat the cow. This ain’t no different.”
	”This is different dad. You are feeding this thing innocent people.”
	“That man behind you is a rapist. The one behind him? Catholic priest, killed a member of his own congregation. Jesus, son. You think I’d do this to innocent people? Do you think I’m some kind of monster?”
	”Yes” I sneered
	”Well, sorry you see it that way” He sighed as he began to close the door, intending to leave me inside. Maybe he will come back for me later. Maybe not. I couldn’t take that risk.
	As he turned I grabbed a lump of a jawbone I could see sticking out from the floor. Snapping it in half, I lunged forward and dug it into my father’s hamstring. He yelled and twisted around, hitting me across the head hard. We both rolled. I stood first and found the bowl he had been using to gather chunks of fleshy meat from the wall. I used it as a bludgeon and struck my father over the head. I kept hitting him until I could tell he was unconscious, his nose bent out of place and blood plastering the wet floor beneath his head. He was still alive, he was breathing at least. I turned and walked up the stairs he had come down to retrieve me. I locked the door on my way out. I followed the leaf-cutters up the stairs, each of them carrying a small, fleshy chunk.
	I left home that day. I was 14 and it was hard living on my own at such a young age. I made it work though. Finding places to employ me as cheap labor and pay me under the table was surprisingly easy. I grifted like this for most of my teens and early twenties. I eventually met the most amazing woman and settled down in a house of our own. We had a daughter. Life treated me well, outside the PTSD and panic attacks any time anyone would get sick. Life was good.
	Then the ants came back. First, just a few. I figured it was a new colony just starting up outside of our little house. Then within a week there were thousands, all flocking to our untouched tool shed in the backyard. I brushed it off as some odd coincidence. Probably some form of denial. Then, my wife began having fainting spells. I opened the shed to find a small viscera of misaligned bug legs and rat skulls. I knew what needed to be done. I knew I needed to feed it.

1nbcqv0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MadTheories/comments/1nbcqv0/calories_to_lose_weight_your_guide_to_a_balanced/,Calories to Lose Weight: Your Guide to a Balanced Calorie Deficit,"Wondering about **calories to lose weight**? The key to weight loss is consuming fewer calories than your body burns, creating a calorie deficit. This doesn’t mean starving yourself—it’s about finding a sustainable calorie intake that supports fat loss while keeping you energized and healthy. Let’s break down how to calculate your calorie needs, share practical tips, debunk myths, and inspire you to kickstart your weight loss journey.

# Why Calories Are Key for Weight Loss

Calories represent the energy your body uses for daily activities, from breathing to exercising. To lose weight, you need to burn more calories than you consume, prompting your body to tap into stored fat. The question **calories to lose weight** hinges on finding the right calorie intake for your unique needs—based on age, weight, height, activity level, and goals. Let’s dive into how to make it work.

# How to Calculate Calories for Weight Loss

To determine **calories to lose weight**, follow these steps:

* **Estimate your maintenance calories**: Use the Mifflin-St Jeor equation or an online calculator to find your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR), the calories you burn at rest. For example, a 35-year-old, 5’6”, 160-pound woman might have a BMR of \~1,400 calories. Multiply by an activity factor (1.2 for sedentary, up to 1.9 for very active) to get your Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE), say 1,800-2,200 calories.
* **Create a calorie deficit**: For safe weight loss (1-2 pounds per week), reduce your TDEE by 500-750 calories daily. This might mean eating 1,200-1,700 calories per day. Avoid going below 1,200 (women) or 1,500 (men) to prevent nutrient deficiencies.
* **Incorporate exercise**: Activities like 30 minutes of brisk walking (\~150-200 calories burned) or High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) (\~300-500 calories) can increase your deficit, allowing slightly more food while still losing weight.
* **Adjust regularly**: Weigh yourself weekly. If you’re not losing 1-2 pounds, cut 100-200 more calories or increase activity. Recalculate TDEE after losing 10-15 pounds, as your calorie needs decrease with weight loss.

# Practical Tips for Managing Calories

Here’s how to maintain the right **calories to lose weight** effectively:

* **Choose nutrient-dense foods**: Fill up on vegetables (e.g., spinach, broccoli), lean proteins (e.g., chicken, tofu), whole grains (e.g., quinoa), and healthy fats (e.g., avocado). These keep you satisfied on fewer calories.
* **Track your intake**: Use an app or journal to log meals for a week to master portion sizes and stay within your calorie target.
* **Spread calories wisely**: Divide your daily calories across 3-4 meals or snacks to stabilize hunger and energy levels.
* **Avoid liquid calories**: Skip sugary drinks like soda or juice, opting for water, unsweetened tea, or black coffee to save calories.
* **Boost activity**: Add 30-60 minutes of exercise daily, like walking, cycling, or strength training, to increase your calorie burn and support your deficit.
* **Stay hydrated**: Drink 2-3 liters (8-10 cups) of water daily to curb false hunger cues and support metabolism.

These habits make hitting your **calories to lose weight** goal sustainable and effective.

# Busting Myths About Calories and Weight Loss

There’s a lot of confusion around **calories to lose weight**. Let’s debunk some myths:

* **Myth: Extremely low calories are best.** Eating below 1,200 (women) or 1,500 (men) calories can slow metabolism, cause fatigue, and lead to muscle loss.
* **Myth: All calories are equal.** A calorie from nutrient-rich foods (e.g., eggs) is more filling and beneficial than one from processed snacks (e.g., cookies).
* **Myth: You must track calories forever.** Tracking teaches portion control, but over time, you may estimate intuitively.
* **Myth: Exercise eliminates the need for a deficit.** Diet drives weight loss more than exercise, though activity boosts your calorie burn.
* **Myth: Supplements create a deficit.** Products like Mitolyn may claim to enhance metabolism, but they lack FDA approval and aren’t a substitute for a calorie deficit.

Focusing on facts helps you manage **calories to lose weight** effectively.

# The Role of Metabolism

Your metabolism is central to **calories to lose weight**. It determines how many calories you burn daily, and eating protein, exercising (especially strength training), and getting 7-8 hours of sleep can boost it. A healthy metabolism makes your calorie deficit more effective. Curious about enhancing metabolism naturally? Check out this [helpful resource](http://33.jessicakid.com/) for more ideas.

# Staying Motivated

The **calories to lose weight** journey is as much about mindset as math. Celebrate small wins, like sticking to your calorie goal or feeling more energized. Connect with friends or an online group for support—they’ll cheer you on. Keep your “why” in focus: you’re building a healthier, more confident you.

# Your Next Steps

Ready to tackle **calories to lose weight**? Calculate your TDEE, aim for a 500-750 calorie deficit, and try one or two tips—like tracking meals or adding a daily walk—for a week. Monitor your progress and adjust with a nutritionist if needed. For more tools and ideas, check out this [helpful resource](http://33.jessicakid.com/).

If tariffs for our HS code are removed, will they have to still pay the $17 for customs clearance even though no tariffs or duties apply?",4,1757300626.0,dhl,1,0.83,False

…it’s the humble looking Whipped Honey and Vanilla!

I’m going to preface this by saying I’m a gourmand lover and an absolute fiend for honey in all forms. I was so excited for this one, and it was love at first sniff!

Well, or so I thought.

The opening is a lovely whipped cream and honey scent evoking a fresh pastry. However, the dry down becomes sickly and cloying. It’s like you dumped a bottle of coffee flavoring syrup onto your skin, then let it dry in 90 degree heat. It smells like you’d expect your skin to feel sticky. Unfortunately, it has an odd staying power for BBW, making it hard to get off your skin or dilute once applied.

It actually triggered a coughing fit for me, and I don’t have any allergies at all!

So yeah, this definitely isn’t one you should blind buy, try it IRL first!

Then, using a 3 tbsp cookie scoop (large), scoop the cookie dough, roll the dough balls in the extra sugar and place on the cookie sheets.

We met online on the last Tuesday of August. As we started talking about everything, I was so looking forward to speaking with you again and again.

You know this already because I told you. Now it's Sunday morning and just like the Another Chance video, my heart became too big and probably scared you.

I cried, reasoned with God, talked to my therapist and waited for you to come back. 

I know there are so many things that are against our connection including distance, age difference and probably my ugly and old face. Despite the obstacles, real or imagined, I want you. It may sound silly and overwhelming, but I wanted to be your girlfriend, you lover, your friend. 

I was thinking of your voice and laugh. Your cats and your ways sighing that I can't tell you this in person.

The wind is heavy this morning and I wish I was sitting in your lap embraced in my garden chair. The wind chime balancing a random tune. I imagine romantic gestures with no words, while our coffees(decaff for you) are getting cold. The smell of you in my nostrils, my mouth searching yours until they meet. A sudden rush of blood to my heart and letting go of everything else. God, I wish this moment would never end.

My imagination moves your hands on my breasts and I start melting Everything feels right and I want to make love to you slowly, mapping your body and feeling happy that you found me.

I really hope you will come back to me. I miss you....

# it's a banger

A footman hand delivered a letter to the cozy side of east 61st and Agnes informs us that Aurora's bleeding heart has found a new cause to drip all over, Marian tells the room that the charity Aurora has chosen this time is the Red Cross and it will kick off with Clara Barton giving a speech to find help with the fundraising efforts to which Ada is very excited to attend. Then Ada who is doing needlepoint by the window spots My Girlie Gladys leaving the house on a walk with her governess and Marian exclaims ""ugh she's with a babysitter! I know I, a grown woman, HATE that"" and Agnes is like ""the only sensible thing that woman across the street does is keep that daughter away from making stupid choices"" and Marian is like ""sounds like a prison"" so Ada decides to push the conversation in a different direction ""Why hasn't the girl who is very clearly debutante age not made her debut?"" and Agnes is like ""oh I know the answer to this one...well I know the answer to everything...but the answer here is that Mrs. Russell knows no one will come to a ball thrown by her""

Outside my Girlie Gladys and her pleasant jailer are walking to find a carriage because Gladys has a secret assignation planned with some boy and she's blackmailed the governess into being her accomplice because she caught her stealing booze. My question is if her parents don't know this man (which we know because the governess is pushing her to introduce him to them) her brother until recently has been away at college, the governess herself doesn't know this man yet, and Gladys isn't allowed out of the house unaccompanied and since she isn't out she's not going to social events...HOW DID SHE MEET HIM?! Did she answer an ad for a pen pal in the paper?! Does she like piña coladas and getting caught in the rain?! Seriously, someone make it make sense.

[how did they meet?!](https://i.redd.it/ra7b5eshcunf1.gif)

Back inside the cozy side but downstairs, Mrs. Gambler and Little Red are of course preparing a huge meal when Jack walks in with an adorable disheveled hair swoop and a newspaper. He's read in said paper that there is a magic lantern show opening on Broadway that weekend and he wants to know if Little Red wants to go with him and she instantly starts stalling, but Mrs. Gambler is like ""please don't waste your life in someone else's kitchen all the time and go have some fun...please!"" so Jack asks Mr. Bannister if its cool even though Little Red didn't say yes and Bannister is all like ""This job is supposed to be like 27/7"" and Mrs. Gambler is like ""let the kids play!!!""

[Bridget wants to stab Mrs. Bauer at the end there](https://i.redd.it/yac1ffjjfunf1.gif)

Across the street Daddy is doing Robber Barony things in his home office when the So Far Failed Socialite comes in with a copy of The Times and is like ""it says in the paper that the alderman may rescind the law? how will we get that station if they do this"" and Railroad Daddy is like ""say what? this is some bullshit but I guess I knew these assholes would try to fuck me somehow...anyway where is my baby?"" and she's like ""she’s out with her babysitter, because she's a baby"" and he's like ""she's only a baby to me in the sense that she's my little girl but she's a grown ass woman because this is the 1880s and we treat 16 year olds like they are rational and capable adults"" and she's like ""she's a baby until I say otherwise""

So we follow Railroad Daddy to his actual office. He's asked Mr. Stinkface to come by, Daddy didn't do enough spanking last week because he's ready to smack some more bottoms. Mr. S is like ""I am an important Old Money man, please don't speak to me like I am a servant"" and RD is like ""bitch, when I'm done with you, you're going to be on those knees BEGGING me for the privilege of shining my shoes” and Mr. S is like ""I came here because you asked me to but I'm not going to be insulted by an upstart"" and RD is like ""you came here because you know if you didn't I would show up at your place of work and spank that ass harder than I did to your wife"" and Mr. S is like ""politicians are going to politic and we are supposed to serve the people, the people don't want a big ugly mass transit center in the middle of the City, that seems like it will only help the poors!"" and RD is like ""are you going to pretend that you didn't do a bunch of insider trading and get rich and then decide to screw me so you can turn around and get even more rich when you're dancing on my grave?"" and Mr. S is like ""I don't know what you’re talking about"" and storms out of the office humming *We're In The Money*

[Mr. Smugface is more apt I think](https://preview.redd.it/y018ibsmmunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=a08514bcaca714273f9588876f03ae41b00df2a2)

We head to the charity meeting Girl Cousin has organized and I am sorry this magnificent room is in her HOUSE?! this looks like a fucking chapel, my god rich people fucking suck. Anyway these people are at the edge of their seat while Ms. Barton is trying to make their hearts bleed money, one of the enraptured audience members is THE Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor who seems to be one of the only people who can make Mrs. Stinkface actually smile. There is a man standing behind them who keeps making eyes over at Ada who is on the other side of the room. The talk is over and the man beelines across the room to Ada and is like ""Yo do you remember me?! and the Spinster is thinking to herself *men don’t circle the block for women like me so it cannot possibly be who I think it is* and he’s like “I am Cornelius Eckworthlessington III! You remember me? I tried to pick up all those years ago but then I moved to Connecticut” and Marian who we know is stubborn but also doesn’t yet have a good judgment when it comes to men is like “aw this is so sweet! how random that you happened to run into someone you knew like 50 years ago!” and he’s like “actually, Mrs. Stinkface is my niece, she told me that your aunt would be here so I figured I'd come see if she is as naive now as she was back then"" and Marian who is totally oblivious to how smarmy this guy is like ""you should call on us at 61st street!"" and he bounds off excited by that invitation. As he leaves the hostess and Mrs. S come over to say hello and Girl Cousin is like ""hey cuz, you think you can back my newest cause?"" and Little Miss Stubborn is like ""you know who has a lot of money to donate? MY FUCKING NEIGHB..."" and Mrs. S is like ""NOT AGAIN YOU TIRESOME LITTLE GIRL!!! Stop talking about that nouveau riche nincompoop!!! Besides my man said her man is a liar and a thief. I don't know the specifics but my angel would NEVER lie or be dishonorable!"" and she storms off. Marian is like ""she has to have that wrong because I am right about everything!""

[this is inside a HOUSE](https://preview.redd.it/6r1owtbvmunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c4d059c0bd3daaa43c6a83b422992b06c6a2cabf)

Back to Russell Manor and the So Far Failed Socialite is trying to get Railroad Daddy explain to her exactly how the alderman are screwing them, and its a good thing because I don't think any of The Poors like myself watching this show have any idea about how stocks work. So he tells her that after they repeal the law, the stock in the Robber Baron Consolidated Trust will plummet and then be super cheap, so they will rebuy the stock at the low low price and then pass the law again which will raise the price by an astronomical rate but by then the Russells will be broke. SFFS is like ""I didn't marry a weak punk ass bitch, FIGHT BACK!"" and he's like ""but if I do it's got to be off the books dirty fighting, in which we might lose all of this anyway"" and she's like ""and?! I still have my farm girl clothes in the closet. I can sweep floors for a bit"" and he's like ""damn if the kids weren't home I'd do you right here and now."" Daddy leaves the drawing room is about to go upstairs when my Girlie Gladys cuts him off ""oh DADDY, can you do me a big favor? Pretty please with a cherry on top?"" and he's like ""is this going to get me in trouble? because right now you mom is my favorite person""

[ROMAN EMPIRE](https://i.redd.it/iloq15k1dunf1.gif)

Across the street Marian is telling Agnes about running into Ada's old beau and she's like ""oh I remember that family, they were poor and my daddy had good sense to keep them away from us"" and Marian is like ""seems like they used to date or something"" and Agnes is like ""so you think he's circling the block for this old spinster?"" and Ada is like ""hey, I'm right here"" but Marian jumps in and is like ""I bet he is going to circle the block, pick her up and let his horse poop on your door step as they leave you forever!"" but before Agnes can retort her son walks in and is like ""Hey! I just thought I'd come in and say hello since I am having dinner with your favorite new neighbors!"" and Agnes is looking like she's trying to battle her body from having a stroke.

[Recycled Fellowes Line Alert!](https://i.redd.it/531db9xseunf1.gif)

Back to the Manor and Daddy stepped out of his office to see the Troublemaker walking in the hall and he's like ""Yo, where is that babe I am married to?"" and the Troublemaker who doesn't miss an opportunity gets right up in his personal space bubble and you can see he's thinking to himself *why did I ask this bitch anything?! She proved last week she's not afraid to push the envelope* so she’s like “my lord and master, I hope you realize everyone on staff, but especially me, would do ANYTHING you asked of us, because we want you to be successful so we can keep our jobs but also because I just worship the ground you walk on” and he’s moving so fast to get away from her you would think he’s on fire. The butler is skulking around the corner and has put the Troublemaker on his watch list.

We’re in the dinner that Oscar was invited to and the So Far Failed Socialite is trying to make small talk with him. He says his career path was nepotistically chosen for him and his daddy was founding member of the bank he works for. He says this bank was founded in 1797, and we find out (later) in this episode that his dad died 10 years ago in 1872…that’s 75 years between the founding and his death. So let’s say he was 20 when the bank was founded….he was 95 when he died. Agnes married him 40 years prior (we learned that earlier in the episode) so this man was mean, abusive, and around 65 when he married Agnes?! I know she can be uppity and prejudiced but I will always stan a woman who threw herself into the arms of a lurid man to save her sister.

Anyway back to dinner, Larry goes all melancholic when he hears Oscar followed marching orders into the family business because its obvious that is exactly what he doesn’t want to do himself, my Girlie Gladys who always seems to want to sway the conversation in another direction shouts out “CAN WE TALK ABOUT MY BOYFRIEND INSTEAD?!” and her mother is like “the fuck? we have a guest” and Oscar the guest is like “oh I know him because one thing Old Money will do is create alliances between families by any means necessary…its usually incest but in this case its just that his auntie was named as my godmother! anyway, my dad was like 40 years older than my mother, so I think severe age gaps are the way to go and Archie is not even 10 years older than you? he’s basically still in the womb” and my Girlie is like “but he’s a hottie and Daddy is going to invite him to dinner” and Daddy is like “are you trying to get me killed?! I said we had to ask your beautiful sugar plum fairy of a mother for permission because I would ever go behind your back like that babe I love you so much please do not be mad at me, I want sex later” and SFFS is like “you best believe no one sits at this table without my express invitation! never forget who is the real head of household!” and Daddy doesn’t argue because he wants that sex later. My Girlie chimes in with “also the hottie’s family is so old and established that they were like fighting at the inception of this country!” and Larry swoops his head up so that little curl on his forehead does a little dance and he says “were your great grandparents even here 100 years ago or were they too busy paddywhacking the potato farm in your motherland?” and RD is like “what the hell did I pay for college for if you don’t understand her being Irish makes you Irish too?!” and then Curls apologizes to his father for being dumb instead of apologizing to his mother for attempting to belittle her. Oscar wants to turn the conversation from the awkward direction its taking and asks Railroad Daddy about the railroad that he’s the daddy of, and we all know things are not going well so the conversation stays awkward. Now SFFS decides to ask Oscar about his eye for architecture and Oscar spins it into an opportunity to flirt with My Girlie so he asks her opinion and you can see she’s shook because no one ever has asked he opinion about anything before so she blushes and her mother smells a rat and is now side eying the hell out of Mr. Van Rhijn.

[Larry has been a jerk to his mom the whole time](https://i.redd.it/b20qbac0iunf1.gif)

Across the street Marian is reading a letter and Agnes’ nosy ass is like “LET ME READ IT!” and Ada is like “boundaries!” and Marian is like “it’s from the lawyer, he’s leaving Doylestown and moving to Manhattan” and Agnes is like “why does he think you’ll care about that? we had that tea party so we could be rid of him!” and Marian is like “I am not going to like run off and marry him but it would be fun to have a friend who knows where I come from?” and Agnes is like “no not this man because he won’t be content with just being your friend. I have been around the block several times and I have seen many men like this one…he belongs to the streets, leave him there”

Back to the Manor and Bertha is wearing a nightgown that is so see-through she can set the house on fire with how hot she looks and I know because I am on fire just looking at her. Daddy thanks her for saving him from discussing the potential demise of his company at dinner but he then tells her that they should let My Girlie’s boyfriend come to dinner because she should have a social life and The Smoke Show is like “Nope, I will pick her husband and he ain’t it. Neither is that Van Rhijn dude so he better stop sniffing” and Daddy is like “yeah, he seems like a fortune hunter and my baby can only marry for love” and The Smoke Show is like “no, she can marry a fortune hunter, I just get to choose which one” and RD is like “wait what?” and she’s like “how are you going to save your business? because our daughter needs a fortune for people to hunt” and he’s like “I have a plan but like I said before, it might cost us everything” and she’s like “I already told you I still have the farm girl clothes, do you want me to put it on and we can get kinky?” and he’s like “honestly that nightgown had me ready since like 5 minutes ago but your words have made it urgent, let’s bang!”

[🥵](https://i.redd.it/uh0c49y2iunf1.gif)

In another part of town we check in on The Gays of The Gilded Age and they too have just engaged in banging because while they have put their chonies back on (boo! where is the NUDITY?! this is HBO!), Oscar is smoking which is universal old timey code for a post coital interaction. Mr. Adams is like “why so glum babe? I pulled some of your favorite tricks during the pickle tickle, did you not like it?” and Oscar is like “no, I am thinking about the girl I want to marry and since I am gay I have to be like pensive and reflective instead of overjoyed but I am still actually kind of excited. You knew we would always have to find a beard eventually right?” and John makes a face like he’s never thought about women ever…he knows they exist but he just doesn’t ever think about them so he asks “who is this bitch I have to be jealous about?” and Oscar is like “oh I can’t tell you that because yet because the way you said that seems like you are going to sabotage it. But this girl is an heiress and she’s so sheltered she’d walk right into this trap I am setting without realizing it! its the perfect solution to my life problems” and John is like “you don’t have problems because you are the heir to a sizable fortune yourself, anyway what about me? do you expect me to just be your side piece?” and Oscar is like “Yes.”

To Wall Street we go and the camera pans up the side of Daddy’s office so we are reminded how successful he is with a whole ass building that tall, inside Mr. Smooth Voice is reading news off of a ticker tape. Railroad Daddy comes in and is like “did they screw us?” and SV is like “HARD. the most uncomfortable banging of all time” and RD is like “that’s ok because i had the good kind of banging last night with the absolute smoke show I am married to...” and SV is like “awkward, we are working I don’t want to hear about your sex life…anyway what should we do?” and RD is like “BUY BUY BUY! Ruin me to artificially inflate the value of my company, let’s fuck these guys right back” and SV says “aye aye, captain” and bounds out of the room. A new employee comes into the room and RD is like “hello there stenographer! it’s a beautiful day!!” and she’s like “and you look GOOOOOOOD, damn you so fine, but why are you so happy?” and he’s like “you know me, I am happiest when I am spanking asses” and she’s like “I wish you would spank mine” and he is like “what was that?” and she’s like “err, you can do it sir!”

A new location and out comes the Unstable Shyster that Agnes told her niece to stay away from but we pan out to see that stubborn ass niece and her only friend waiting to see him. He sees her and is thinking *thank god her aunt is against me because this makes things easier* but he’s like “what a surprise to find you here!” and she’s like “Oh I was just accompanying Pretty Peggy to your meeting on my way to my own meeting!” and he’s like “step in to my office so we can flirt a bit before you head back” and  Peggy gives them both a look that says *white people are so reckless and dumb but I inexplicably support Marian so go on* and the two dummies head into the office. Marian is like “oh my god we are unchaperoned in this office! Was that the reason behind the look Peggy just gave me?! I should go” and he’s like “I just need a minute to plant the seeds into your head” and she’s like “huh?” and he’s like “since you can’t stay we should meet for lunch! let me prattle off a half dozen locations you have never heard of” and she’s like “you’re right, I don’t know any of these, I've lived here for months and you only a few days but you are like Mr. NYC?” and he’s like “how about a tryst in a hotel! for coffee of course” and she’s like “of course not!” and he’s like “aww you’re a boring rule following prude!” and she’s like “um NO, I am Little Miss Stubborn!!! but also a pragmatist about my reputation because I am a woman, so its actually dumb for me to be in this office, I should go!” and he’s like “let’s casually run into each other in public like it’s not planed! I’ll be by the hand of the statue that France is making for America next Monday, I hope to see you there” she responds with a signature Fellowes line a little less convincingly than Michelle Dockery delivered it when it was in her script (but I mean, Michelle was *that girl* in her turn as Lady Mary so that’s a tough act to follow) and flies out of the office.

[then like, stay away from him?](https://preview.redd.it/gn8pr3z0nunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=65ddef7f82a7e7667a9c232e2651116f2e59eaca)

New location and we see Mr. Stinkface power walking like he’s barefoot on coals but he wants people to think he’s a big strong man. He bursts into an office and at the desk is literally a guy who looks like a Ken doll has come to life and Greta Gerwig really missed a casting opportunity for the Barbie movie. Mr. S is like “OH MY GOD DID YOU SEE THE TICKER TAPE? IS IT FUCKING TRUUUUUE?” and Anthropomorphic Ken is like “Yeah, our plan is not doing so hot and the stock price is going in the opposite direction but that surly can’t last forever because Railroad Daddy is obviously behind this and eventually he will ruin himself before he can ruin us” and Mr. S is like “are you sure because I am going to put a gun in my mouth if you’re wrong” and AK is like “BET” On his way out of Anthropomorphic Ken’s office, Mr. S runs in to Agnes’ bitch ass son (I like Oscar, but if he’s trying to dupe My Girlie into marriage he’s a punk ass bitch) and Oscar is like “hey Morris, you good?” and Mr. S says “yeah I was just having a meeting with your cousin’s husband” and Oscar is like “I heard at my very eXcLuSiVe club, the Union, which will be a hot location on this show that George Russell is about to lose it all?” and Mr. S is like “yeah totally, he’s doing crazy stock market tricks and it’s not going to work” and Oscar is like “DAMN, I better start looking for a new heiress” and Mr. S is like “I hope I am doing this manifesting shit correctly”

Back to the cozy servant’s hall and Pretty Peggy is reading a letter. Mrs. Gambler is fussing over her because she is MOTHER downstairs and she cares about Peggy most of all since she helped her keep her job. We pan out to see this is just the ladies, Jack and Bannister are no where to be seen. Pretty Peggy gasps at her letter and Mrs. G is like ""girl, SPILL THE TEA"" and Peggy is like ""its from the editor or the very white, very religious, Religious Propagandist paper and he wants to publish my short stories!"" and Little Red is like ""oh my god I can't wait to read them! it's so cool to know a real author!"" and Bigoted Lady's Maid is like ""you can't even read you illiterate trollop!"" and LR is like ""I can read well enough! but not well enough that I know what those words mean"" Mrs. G butts in loudly over both of them and says to PP ""I am so excited for you!"" then the bigot groans and Mrs. G turns to her and says ""keep your fucking mouth shut or I will sew it closed"" and she turns back to PP and gives her a big warm smile. Just then the men show up and Bannister is like ""men hungry! feed us!"" but the ladies (except for the bigot of course) want to gush about PP's big news. Peggy is so fueled by the news she excuses herself and runs off without eating, Jack pipes up to say ""that's exciting for her but even more exciting for me is I got a hot date tonight with Little Red!"" and LR is like ""not hot, not a date, just a thing we are going to do simultaneously and I'm coming home as soon as it's over""

We are in the dining room of Girl Cousin's house and seriously, was this place a church before it became a private residence? Anyway its Aurora, THE Caroline Webster Schermerhorn Astor, Mrs. Stinkface, Cornelius Eckworthlessington III, Spinster Sister and Little Miss Stubborn eating a small plate of food but drinking large goblets of red wine in the middle of the day. Aurora says they need to like make their Red Cross support political and everyone agrees but then Marian is like ""like the suffragettes!"" and everyone clutches their pearls. So CEIII uses this as an opportunity to size up the fish he wants to catch and asks Ada all these questions about her life, she mostly talks about her sister's life because as a spinster...she didn't really have a life of her own...this is where we learn Agnes' feckless husband at least has good foresight with real estate investments and he's been dead for a decade. Then CEIII is like ""so can I call on you for like tea or something?"" and Little Miss Stubborn is like ""YES THAT WOULD BE GREAT!"" and Mrs. Astor thinks this conversation is boring because she is supposed to be the center of attention so she starts talking about how the Upstart Platoon of the Morgans, Rockefellers, and Vanderbilts are colluding to open a new opera house since Old Money wont give them boxes at the Academy of Music. So then Marian wants to be stubborn and says ""well those guys are rich as fuck, just like my favorite neighbors the Russells and will probably build an opera that will make your house look like a school pageant if you don't just let them in, so why not just give them boxes?"" and everyone once again looks at her like she should be in the loony bin. So of course she wants to push more because of the stubbornness but Ada knocks her down and when Ada thinks you're out of line, you shut the fuck up.

Back to the cozy servant’s hall and Pretty Peggy is doing some writing in her note book, Bannister comes in and is like “this is awkward but someone tried to use the front door to see you instead of the servant’s entrance so I told him to wait outside and he said he’d rather wait at Central Park” and Pretty Peggy is now Puzzled Peggy. We follow her to the park where she sees the man and Puzzled Peggy is now Perturbed Peggy because the man is her father whom we established two episodes back is not her favorite person. He’s like “I realized you think the ferry only runs one way so I had to take it to see you since you won’t come home” and she goes to rebut but some bigots are walking by and think the Scotts should move out of their path instead of them going around the Scotts because their insides are so rotten that they don’t even have a brain, zombie ass bitches. Anyway they move out of the way and Peggy’s Papa says that it’s her Mama’s birthday coming up and Peggy isn’t mad at her mom so she should come home to celebrate with them and then he dumbly says he can forgive her for what she did which is not something you should say when whatever the fight is about is the reason she doesn’t want to see you? Anyway she has the exact reaction I thought she would have and is like “forgive ME?! You need to find jesus or something. I will come home for my mama and *only* my mama and only for the day because I am a very busy and employed woman” and he's like ""employed doing what? scribbling notes for a white septuagenarian?"" and she's like ""well that AND I have an offer to possibly write for the *Religious Propagandist* newspaper"" and he's like ""more white people stuff, you couldn't even try to write for the black paper?"" and she's like ""they didn't want me, I tried"" and he's like ""this will end badly so just come home and work for me"" and Pretty Puzzled Perturbed Peggy rolls her eyes so far back she almost passes out and she says goodbye.

To the stuffy servant's hall of Russell Manor, Mr. Watson is holding a paper but he's not reading it, he's kind of creepily watching the Troublemaker while she's darning something. She notices and his not flattered, so he looks into his paper then announces he's going out. Once he leaves Housekeeper turns to the Troublemaker and says ""so are you going to get in on that? he's obviously interested"" and the Troublemaker starts to gag and says ""my plans involve homewrecking for money...the valet doesn't have a home to wreck or money to provide, so no.""

Little Miss Stubborn and Spinster Sister are walking home from their luncheon and of course LMS is being as stubborn as stubborn can be and says ""we need money for this charity and our neighbor has tons, I still don't understand why we can't ask her to donate! Also weird hat lady is uber rich and apparently has a bleeding heart, why not ask her too?"" and SS is like ""Mrs. Russell maybe, but Mrs. Chamberlain's a hard no, let that one go!"" and LMS is like ""but what has she done that is so terrible you don't even want her money for charity?!"" and SS is like ""she like *knew* her husband too well before they were married"" and Marian might be stubborn but she's also still fresh off the prairie and super naive because she has no earthly idea of what Ada is trying to tell her.

Back to Girl Cousin's house and I guess this is their library or study? the doors on these bookshelves are beautiful so here I am envious while I write that Anthropomorphic Ken is explaining to his wife that the pep talk he tried to give Mr. Stinkface was bullshit and they are truly fucked and about to possibly loose the gorgeous bookshelves along with everything else in their home, even the home itself because the alderman tried to humiliate Railroad Daddy and Girl Cousin is not amused, but then Ken tries to throw it back on her and say this is her fault for humiliating the So Far Failed Socialite. Like, what? Why are men like this? Stop deflecting blame and take your spanking like a man!!!

The date night has finally arrived! Jack and Little Red are at a theater watching the Magic Lantern show. The music is lively, the audience is engage and Little Red seems to be having a good time, she even casually looks over at her date with a very curious look about her that would lead you to believe she's got a little crush maybe? But then things take a turn because he goes to show her physical affection and she shuts it down and clams up quick.

[😩](https://i.redd.it/33mhxofzeunf1.gif)

Our check in with the date is cut too short because we have to watch Mr. Stinkface cry about how he fucked up his whole life but just like Anthropomorphic Ken is going to take the Worthlessington route and blame his wife. ""You got to go lick whatever Mrs. Russell wants you to lick to get us out of this!"" and she's like ""are you fucking mental? there is no way you can expect me to do that?"" and he's like ""I don't just expect it, I am pulling the patriarchal dominance card and I am commanding your ass to crawl over there right now!!!"" and her Resting Stinkface looks like she's actively inhaling the scent of her own vomit.

[he really had some of the best facial expressions in this episode](https://preview.redd.it/ujh5v5lulunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=f0d345bd017f0a79b9c9f8451f095b5779afcd52)

Back to the date and they are leaving the show. Jack tries another approach to woo her and asks if they can go out for a sweet treat or just chat over some coffee before going home and Little Red is like ""I am going to be goody two shoes about this and remind you that we have a curfew"" and he's like ""its not like they will fire us and start pouring their own tea or peeling their own potatoes...we can take a little extra break, we deserve it!"" and she's walking so quickly she's already 5 blocks away.

Checking in with The Gays and Boy Cousin is pouring himself a huge glass of whisky. Mr. Adams is like ""what's wrong now babe? we should be banging by now"" and Oscar is like ""I have to withdraw my bid for duping an innocent girl into a loveless lavender marriage because her father won't have money for a dowery after all"" and John is like ""so the companionship and respectability of a 'traditional' marriage isn't enough?"" and Oscar is like ""of course not, I am only doing this because I am fucking greedy!""

We are in a new location and there are portraits of white men on the wall, then we see white men sitting next to each other, one is reading the paper the other is side eying the person to the opposite side of him then the camera pans so we can see that person is Pretty Peggy who once again has to navigate a world with cringey racists everywhere (Peggy is so graceful, I am a Black woman myself and I know my ass would have been killed at a very young age if I lived in this time period) The assistant for Mr. Carlton >!any relation to Billy the coward?!!< comes out and is like ""what the fuck? you never said you were...well...I mean..."" and PP is like ""I think Mr. Carlton was expecting a female author so here I am"" and the ASSistant is like ""but like, a white one because its a white paper"" and Patient Peggy is like ""God loves all his people and y'all literally just preached equality in the last issue that I read as a non white avid reader"" and the ASSistant is like ""have a seat, I'm going to waste your whole day"" and calls one of the dusty ass white men back instead.

Back to Russell Manor and Daddy's home from work, he asks the butler where his boss babe of a wife is and he says ""That Stinkface lady turned up and they are in the drawing room"" and RD is like ""oooh I won't disturb them but maybe I'll eavesdrop from my office."" The So Far Failed Socialite is playing dumb with Mrs. S and says ""you want little old me to tell my husband what to do at work?!"" and Mrs. S is trying SO HARD to have a pleasant look on her face but you can tell she's had little practice at it so instead she's awkwardly giggling between her pleas, SFFS ain't buying shit so she drops the innocent act because she realizes she's got the upper hand and says ""why exactly are you asking me for a favor when you've done nothing but demean and belittle me?"" and that stunned Stinkface into silence, so SFFS gets up and rings the little bell and when the footman comes in she's like ""please escort this bitch out of my house""

Back to Patient Peggy who is now the only person in the waiting room of the *Religious Propagandist* and the ASSistant comes over to tell her that the boss is finally ready for her. Now I would say this is the most demeaning and humiliating experience someone has on this episode but I've seen the whole thing and I know it only gets worse. Mr. Carlton first questions if Peggy could even be as talented of a writer as the stories he read suggests so he accuses her of fraud, then he tells her that they have to change her stories to be about white people because we need to appease the dusty ass racists in the South (they lost the war guys! show them who is boss) then he tells her that she will have to sign a waiver saying she will never tell anyone she's the same Peggy Scott that writes the stories in this paper but its ok because she's going to make hella bank and Pretty Peggy is like ""I am not Marian, I can't just lie like that.""

Marian is now with Peggy and she tells her that she made the right choice ""Even me, a certified liar thinks that is a bridge too far! But its not like this is the only paper in the city! you'll find another one"" But their conversation dies out because they have to admire another wonderful CGI masterpiece, this time it's Liberty's Hand and now we know they are going to meet up with the Unstable Shyster. He asks Peggy if she wants to chaperone their walk around the park and Peggy is like ""I am not really about that third wheel life"" So the two of them take a turn around the park and he's like ""I'd love to come to tea and tell you all about my life but your aunt still is against that?"" and she's like ""she was barely for it the first time"" and he thinks *sweet, this girl is so stubborn if I give her a reason to defy her aunt she'll eat it up!* and just like that he fucking proposes to her. Marian is like ""um, we've met like 5 times"" and he's like ""but you're definitely not against the idea and now I will leave you mid adrenaline rush so that you can confuse excitement with love"" Peggy runs over and is like ""are you ok you look like you're going to faint but like in a happy way?"" and Marian is like ""HE PROPOSED!?!""

[so realistic!](https://preview.redd.it/3tldg7cfmunf1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b57fac094311815508a5d9958d41a414dbea97a)

At her Aunt's house Cornelius Eckworthlessington III has called for that tea and he's trying to be chummy with Agnes but if there is one thing my girl can do, its sniff out a rat. For once Pumpkin and Agnes are on the same side because when he goes to pet Pumpkin, he gives a low growl. Agnes kicks her sister out so she can tell this asshole off and she does. He's like ""oh your sister was the one who got away! she's so beautiful and fun and intelligent and I am so happy to see..."" and Agnes is like ""shut the fuck up. You tried to pick up my sister decades ago and my Papa said no because you were obviously a fortune hunter, and now you are lonely and no doubt broke so you think you can pick her up again and that I will fund it? In your dreams loser. You don't have to go home, but you can't stay here...get the fuck out of my house!!!"" Ada comes back in with the tea for their tea party and the man is already moving so fast his feet look like Sonic the Hedgehog. Ada is sad but Agnes has spent her entire life trying to protect this woman, she knows exactly how to redirect her focus and she does.

[you got lucky my dear](https://i.redd.it/2ni51er5funf1.gif)

To Daddy's office and he's lounging in his big boss chair Infront of the fireplace looking very smug and dare I say sexy as hell. He's all like ""why are you guys asking me to stop doing a very legal thing?"" and the camera turns to reveal a gaggle of middle aged white men, led by Anthropomorphic Ken and Mr. Stinkface. Ken is like ""dude just be a guy's guy for like a few minutes would you?"" and Railroad Daddy is like ""why do you guys always expect what you aren't willing to give in return?!"" and Mr. S is like ""but what if we like clear the way for you to have your station after all?! we could just like, make you happy that way?"" and RD is like ""did you already promise me this and fucking renege on the deal? why should I trust you?"" and Ken is like ""how about if we tell you that you have clearly proven to be smarter than all of us put together? We could put on dunce caps and everything"" and RD smirks and shrugs but Mr. S starts to panic so he gets down on his knees and is like ""I will literally do anything, I could just kneel here and you could put it in my mouth? You said earlier that I would end up begging for the privilege to shine your shoes...so here I am, I don't have any shoe polish with me, do you think your secretary might have some to spare?"" and RD is like ""look pleb, y'all tried to beat me at a game I was never going to lose, that was stupid enough, but then you let your wives make my smoking hot sugar plum fairy of a dream girl feel like a failure and I will take any chance to destroy someone who makes my baby feel bad. The door is over there""

We follow Mr. Stinkface home and the BEST song on The Gilded Age soundtrack is playing so you know drama is coming (the song is called A Hostage to Ridicule on the S1 soundtrack if you're interested) and he's walking very slow because he knows he fucked up bad and the footman who opened the door for him is about to lose his job and the house that the beautiful door is attached to will have to be sold. He tries to skulk away undetected but Mrs. S hears him come in and he's one of the two people her face can make relaxed smiles for, she's like ""lets chat and make googly eyes at each other in the drawing room before the children stop by for a free meal, they won't stay after because they are too cool for us now"" and he's like ""I love our kids, and I love you, and I love this house, and I love everything ever"" and she's like ""ok weirdo, i love you too, lets hang out!"" but she doesn't insist on it and she probably should have. Anyway he heads upstairs and the scene cuts to Russell Manor and The Russells are having champagne in tacky colored flutes in their drawing room, celebrating the fact that Railroad Daddy spanked those asses hard and prevailed, but the ominous music is still building so their celebration is probably going to be short lived. RD is talking about how benevolent he is and that he'll probably let the aldermen off with enough to at least recover to their starting point, unfortunately Patrick Morris didn't get to find that bit out because the big bang the show ends on was not the fun and sexy kind...he literally blew his brains out.

I always thought my “first kiss” would be this magical, rom-com moment, but real life had other plans lol.

It was with a guy I’ve been hanging out with a lot lately. We’re not officially dating, but there’s been this unspoken something between us for weeks. Today we went for coffee after class, then walked around the park because the weather was nice. We were joking around, and at one point I tripped (classic me 🙃). He grabbed my hand to steady me, and I swear my heart went into overdrive.

Here’s the twist: instead of some smooth “lean in,” he just blurted out “Can I kiss you?” I literally froze, panicked, and said “uh… yeah?” like the most awkward human alive. He laughed nervously, then actually kissed me.

And… honestly? The kiss itself wasn’t perfect. Our noses bumped, it was kinda clumsy, and I may or may not have accidentally let out a weird little laugh mid-kiss. BUT the moment right after—when he pulled back, smiled, and tucked my hair behind my ear—was so much better than I imagined.

Now I’m sitting here overthinking everything. Was it just a heat-of-the-moment thing? Does this mean he likes me for real? Am I supposed to text him first now??

His faith in the lord pushed him to surpass the influence not of our father.  This is a man that not only mentored me on my journey of life.

In an instant I had my own coffee brand and was in places where true influence for business is made. The lord said if I want business I can have it. He said there is no ceiling for what I will give you. So with great power comes great responsibility. I had to get right with myself first before using this gift because had to ensure I understood that I was walking in full faith before allowing the economic gains of the gift influence me or change my alignment.

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

We made up our own language.  
Marmar—  
come close,  
don’t drift,  
be home to me.  
Frufrunus—  
we’ll be old and weird and laughing,  
still us.  
Daddyroo and Llamaroo—  
they weren't just pets,  
we were a family.

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

But it unraveled.  
Not all at once.  
Not a clean break.  
The ache of hanging on  
while slowly walking away.  
My sickness made you tired.  
You flirted elsewhere.  
I fought.  
Cut you with words.  
Left.  
Dated someone else.  
Begged you to come back.  
You left.  
Found her.  
I tried jealousy.  
I tried others.  
But it was always you.  
Only you.

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

I told you once before:  
I loved like the mobster in that movie—  
the one who never loved again  
after his wife was gone.  
I told you if I died  
and you found another,  
I would haunt you,  
scare her away,  
until I could find you in another life.

That’s how I loved you.

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

Now all I have are details  
about a stranger.  
Lime green—your favorite color.  
Coffee and crepes—better than restaurants,  
because they were yours.  
The way you danced in a striped scarf and hat,  
all grin and chaos,  
and I said you looked like Where’s Waldo.  
The barn house you wanted to buy.  
The drawings.  
The rowing.  
The way you made  
the world feel like home.

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

You loved me once.  
Terrifying, but true—  
how a love like that could just stop for you.  
That you could live without it.  
That it doesn’t still haunt you.  
That you don’t lie awake at night  
cursing God,  
the sky,  
the universe  
for losing me  
like I do you.

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

But you buried it alive.  
Replaced me with her.  
Told yourself you moved on.

How could you just move on?

If that was ever real—  
love like ours doesn’t die.

I just feel like golf, video games, ect take priority over our time. 

My husband just got back from a bachelor trip…mind you I’m three months postpartum and also have a 20 month old. Anyway we discussed it and decided the trip was fine: 4 days, 3 nights and trip was only golf/fishing/drinking no stripclubs, ect as I already told him this would piss me off especially just having had a baby. I rarely texted or called him during the trip…gave him his space and never complained about how much he spent/drank just told him to let me know when he made it back at nights. The day he gets back I ask if he wants to go out that night for a drink or two so we can catch up and I can hear all about it. Also I’ve been with two kids for four days, haven’t slept through the night once and really just want adult conversation. He says no, that he’s too tired and needs to cut the grass. Whatever. I’m fine with that, shortly after getting home he goes to cut the grass, throws some steaks on the grill we eat dinner and he ends up falling asleep early. I stay up put baby to bed then fall asleep. I wake up early the next morning (like 5am which is rare) and he’s not in bed…I get up thinking maybe he was in the bathroom but he’s downstairs playing video games. Whatever we were all asleep so no big deal. But I ask if he wants to maybe make some coffee and we can just relax in bed and watch our show since the kids are both sleep and he’s been gone the past few days. He gets upset and says he’s playing video games and was planning on it until the kids woke up. So now I’m pissed…I leave and go back upstairs…eventually he comes up doesn’t say anything and puts our show on. AITAH for wanting him to make spending time together more of a priority? He later tells me it’s the only time he has to himself where he can game and I’m like are you serious? You were just gone four days. You don’t get more me time right now. The next night I decide I’m waking him when baby gets up. I never do because I always feel like with breastfeeding it’s easier for me to just get up. So next night she’s up at 4:30am. I had already gotten up with our other daughter and baby had already been up once. Now I shake my husband and I’m like umm the baby’s up. He completely loses it…grabs the baby and goes downstairs yelling at me that he works in two hours and slamming doors. Now I’m scared to even leave the baby with him. Should I not have woken him or am completely overthinking this? He’s like why are you waking me up now when I’ve offered to help with baby in the past? And I’m like well you can be up at 5 am to play video games so now you can be up to help with baby. ",10,1757298901.0,AITAH,17,0.86,False

I could read this book 20 times and find something new every time. There were a lot of clues that I ignored because I wanted to get to the story, but it’s chock full of puzzles, codes, and passages that turn into pictures of words. I felt lost in a maze, particularly during exploration 4. 

After completing, I have more questions than thoughts. Is the house real? How reliable is Johnny? Sometimes his stories and visions sound exactly like what the characters go through in the Navidson Project. Did he make it all up, including Zampanó? It honestly feels like I haven’t really finished the book.

I was worried that finishing the book would make me feel depressed. I did not see things ending well for Johnny, or for Navidson and Karen, but after Johnny’s scene at the Flagstaff, and Navidson’s conclusion to the record I’m relieved the protagonists made it through and found a bit of peace.

This book deserves a proper read through accompanied with a notebook and a pot of coffee, but I’ll have to buy my own copy before that happens (this one is from the library). Easily the most mind boggling book I’ve read. Bravo Danielewski.

I would love to hear anybody’s first impression after finishing their first read through, or how it’s changed since re-reading.

Using a Timemore C2 grinder I set the clicks to 15 (maxes out at 27). Coffee I used is a light roast Ethiopian blend. I used 15g of coffee to 220ml of water. Water temp was 190 degrees. Added the water, did a slight swirl, steeped for 4 minutes and thirty seconds. Swirled again to break the crust, and let sit for another 2 minutes. Then I pressed the plunger gently to the bottom. 

The coffee came out more bitter than anticipated, so I’m assuming that I need to increase the grind size. Seems to be a good place to start. However, it was a decent cup of coffee. I did add 1 tablespoon of heavy cream to tame the bitterness.

For the past hour or so I've been laying in bed trying to ignore the soft, frantic scrabbling of tiny claws with an occasional thump mixed in. These noises are a little easier to ignore than the muffled sobbing coming through the wall from the apartment next door. God, I hope that's not because of me.

Sweet Pea has never been the most energetic cat. She's usually curled up in front of the hall closet napping, when she isn't giving me judgmental stares from around a doorway. I don't know how such a small creature can be so haughty, somehow looking down a nose only four inches from the floor. She didn't even run around the place when we first moved in a couple of months ago. Something must have happened to her today, and I think I might know what it was.

Earlier today when I had just gotten home from work I found the door unlocked. Inside I found a diminutive older woman who appeared to be dressed as a rodeo clown's lawyer crouching down over Sweet Pea with a small plastic bag of handmade treats. I'm sure to most people something like that might be shocking, an event that joins the reliable old party stories like ""The time I thought my dog was a pile of laundry"" for decades to come, but for me it was just Thursday. My landlord Ruth has a little issue with boundaries. 

She's the kind of woman who, in theory, might be lovely to be around in tiny doses. She brings over trays of delicious homemade pastries and cookies that always seem to disappear faster than you think should be possible. She listens to you talk with eyes open wide, bulging behind her thick rhinestone rimmed glasses, heart open even wider.

But it was the third time this week I had come home to find her in my apartment. The third time this week a surprise social interaction was sprung on me when all I wanted to do was kick off my Customer Service Voice at the door and not think about how one day a robot will be able talk to people better than I do.

""Goddamnit Ruth, why are you here when I'm not?""

She jolted upright with a cry like an extinct bird's mating call, knocking the single dining room chair over with her prodigious backside. Sweet Pea tore out of the kitchen like her ass was on fire, bringing down a tower of old pizza boxes in an uncontrolled demolition. Ruth sheepishly kicked a couple of pizza bones into a pile and swiped surprisingly steady hands down the front of her neon fuchsia pantsuit as she hit me with the full force of her $50,000 smile. The cacophonous rattling of her many plastic arm bangles was drowned out by her voice, as soft as a buzzsaw and twice as loud.

""Oh darling I thought I would just poke my head in and tidy up a tad, and then I couldn't just not say hello to Sweet Pea! Oh isn't she just a darling you know I had one just like her except he only had three legs, this was way back in, oh, yes I think it was-""

""You can't keep coming in here when I'm not home, Ruth.""

""Well why not? It's my gosh darn building! I'm here offering my services at no extra charge, to boot! I cook, I clean, I'm pretty nifty with a screwdriver and hammer, I can conversate with the best of 'em! Heck, just the other day-""

""It's against the law?""

""The law!"" She threw her head back and cackled deeply, lime green fingernails clutching at her midsection as she leaned back against the sink. ""Well according to Johnny Law you're just a friend who stays over a lot and helps with the light bill sometimes! I know you don't mean it anyhow, you know if you tell me to get out I'll just up and skedaddle! Come on now Jack, I'm just trying to make a connection. You like me, dont you, Jack? I just want to help my tenants, what's so gosh darn bad about that? Look, the sink is absolutely crawling with ants, this place could sure as heckfire use a woman's touch every now and then!""

I stormed over to the faucet and opened the hot water handle full blast, swiftly and decisively washing the horde of tiny, squirming bugs down the drain. In a way, I felt bad for them. They were just living their little lives, oblivious that in an instant I would decide to wash it all away. Ruth was silent as I enacted my ant genocide and when I turned around afterwards she wore a strange expression I couldn't place on her pinched, leathery face. I thought I was being a bit harsh at the time, but sometimes you kind of have to be to get your damn alone time.

""There, no more ants. No more ants, no more Ruth. Get the fuck out. Please.""

If I had hurt her feelings she recovered quickly, once again blinding me with a smile far too big for her face. Getting hit with that at point blank is like realizing the light at the end of the tunnel is the reflection of your flashlight on a sleek metal cowcatcher bearing down on you.

""I can tell you're having a tough day darling so I'll get out of your hair, the last thing I want is you closing yourself off to me like some of the other tenants. I'll be back another time when you're ready to grab a bag and a broom! Please give Sweet Pea my love, and tell her she's the prettiest most-"" 

Sometimes you have to end her sentences for her so I cut her off there with a winning smile of my own, one forged through many years of serving the public. For maximum effect I squinted my eyes the same way she did. Most people subconsciously enjoy being mirrored, it makes them feel like they're not alone. 

""Okay, thanks Ruth, bye!"" I shouted as I shooed her away from the door and finally she began trundling her way to the elevator. Her thick, square heels portend her looming approach and I pictured the townspeople shuttering their shades in fear that she may darken their doorstep.

Before I could flee to the safety of my nest I turned around to see my neighbor from the other side of the apartment, Darla. Though she had a smirk on her mousey face and a bottle of whiskey in her hands I could also see that her little black tee shirt was inside out and her mascara was running.

""Hey Jagoff. I see you just survived Hurricane Ruth, wanna forget your troubles?"" 

She tilted her head and looked up at me with bright blue eyes that were swimming as her chipped nails played a beat on the glass bottle. I knew that turning her down would just have her crying and throwing things at the wall all night and I was so tired I almost did anyways. I figured with any luck, she would be passed out on the couch in twenty minutes and I could finally get to relaxing.

Today is just not my lucky day.

If she had any comments about the state of my apartment she mercifully kept them to herself, collapsing into the couch like a crumbling ruin as she eagerly unscrewed the bottle. We didn't talk much, thankfully, merely passing the bottle back and forth as we stared blankly at the flickering glow of the TV. Something was clearly bothering her but she didn't want to say, and I didn't want to ask. In a way, it was nice to let all of my thoughts slide out of my head like a cracked egg and just exist.

Eventually, the bottle ran dry. Then the unopened bottle of rum I had stashed in the back of the cabinet ran dry, too. I don't remember what we said as she stumbled out the door. As my hand fell from the knob and I turned around I thought I saw her keyring sitting on the coffee table.

In retrospect, perhaps the way I threw open the door was a bit dramatic, but whatever I had been planning to say was shocked out of me when I saw Darla was still standing there. I turned to look inside to restart my train of thought but the bare top of the table gave me nothing. In hindsight, I had probably been looking at a giant cockroach with my bleary eyes the first time. When I turned back to look at her my swimming mind once again struggled to convey anything. It's supposed to be my job to communicate with people, it was downright shameful.

Whatever I had been trying to communicate, she got a different signal. I won't bore you with the details, for my sake more than yours. The only pertinent ones are that it was unfortunately short, I'm a bit out of practice it seems, and that she was never out of my sight the whole time. Well, we both had our eyes closed for most of it, but you get what I mean. She was probably thinking of someone else, too.

When we were finished I made the worst mistake of all, I tried to be funny.

""Hey, try not to forget your keys this time.""

I think I was setting up some lame pun but I never got that far. She burst into tears and immediately started grabbing her clothes, turning her face away as I tried to explain.

""No, wait, I wasn't saying you should leave. I just-""

She cut me off with a harsh hand gesture, still facing away. Her reply came in a warbling, artificially cheery voice.

""No, no, I know that. I just suddenly remembered s-something and I have to go check on it right now.""

She sniffled loudly and pulled her clothes on with jerky motions, slowly making her way towards the door. Just before she walked out she turned and did her level best at a smile that looked like a chalk sidewalk drawing in a downpour.

""This was... um... nice. Maybe we can hang another time. Sorry I made it so weird.""

She was out the door before I could correct her, and it wasn't a full minute before I heard her softly crying through the wall.

It was getting pretty late by that point so I filled up Sweet Pea's bowl, only briefly stopping to note that she hadn't immediately come sauntering up to judge me through half-lidded eyes, and headed to bed. I should have probably checked her litter box but I was exhausted, and had a pretty good idea that Ruth had made it her first stop.

I haven't seen Sweet Pea all night since I caught Ruth feeding her homemade treats.

Suddenly, a blood curdling scream echoes through the wall, followed by several impacts of smashing glass. I it up motionless in bed for long seconds, struggling to listen for any signs of life over the maddening scrabbling coming from my kitchen. My heart races a mile a minute as I slowly climb out of bed, taking a step towards the wall I shared with Darla. I almost jump clear out of my skin when a crashing sound rings out from my kitchen.

Sweet Pea must have knocked over a mug.

I cross the distance to the wall swiftly, leaving behind a string of mumbled curses I'd rather not repeat here. I press my ear to the wall to listen for signs of life from next door but that only seems to amplify the frantic scratching sounds, the wall somehow picking up the vibrations. Eventually I hear the sobbing pick up again and I breathe a sigh of relief. I'm not going to say she's okay, but at least she's alive over there.

The door to my bedroom makes a soft clicking noise when I turn the handle and the scratching sounds immediately stop. Swallowing hard I open the door and slowly step into the silent stillness. I had forgotten to turn the TV off and the input screen bathes the room in a cool blue, casting harsh shadows across discarded cardboard and half empty plastic bags. The room is as still as you always hope a grave will be.

The compressor in the AC kicks on and a small styrofoam cup clatters to the floor, making my eyes dart to the sink. On the floor below the tiny white cup lazily rolls back and forth in a small field of shiny ceramic shards. The air from the vent must have knocked over the styrofoam, but the mug?

Sweet Pea knows better than to run around on the counter.

I'm tempted to leave the mess for later but I know I'll be stepping in it when I make my morning coffee, plus it could be dangerous to the eight pound cat that lives in the bottom half-foot of my apartment.

I was walking past the sink to grab the broom when I heard the light creak of a stealthy step on a loose laminate floor tile. When I turn to look I see a dark shape dart out of view under the couch and instinctively take a step back, holding in a scream by biting my lip almost as deep as the shards of my favorite mug bite into my heel. The mess can wait, I need to get ahold of that goddamned cat before she gives me a heart attack.

I want to go pluck the broken chunks of ceramic in the bathroom but for some reason I can't bring myself to walk past the sofa.

""Sweet Pea? Come on girl, come out.""

I feel stupid calling to her like that, especially as the silence that answered hangs heavily in the air. She's as likely to come when I call as she is to climb up onto my lap, we just don't have that kind of relationship. I hoped that at least she would move or something, give me some indication that she was alive.

Anxiety digs it's long fingers deep into the back of my skull and squeezes my mind tight as I struggle to dismiss the dark thoughts hemming me in. She's just acting weird. Maybe she caught that roach I saw earlier and doesn't want to talk with her mouth full. Maybe the mug had landed on her head and she lay dying under the couch right now, grey sludge trickling down the sides of her tiny face as she watches what's supposed to be her caretaker tremble in fear and do nothing.

I take a deep breath in to calm my nerves, and almost immediately I can feel the grip of anxiety loosen. Being careful not to bump the shrapnel in my heel I slowly lower myself to the floor to peer underneath the couch. I should have turned on the light, it's pitch black under there and cluttered with old plastic wrappers and long lost socks. 

Jesus, I need to clean up a bit sometime. I know it's been getting bad, I know I have to clean it up at some point, but I just never seem to have the energy. Putting on the Fake Smile Voice all day to deal with entitled rich assholes is exhausting, by the time I get home I just want to sink into the sofa and forget about the day.

Crawling towards the couch on my hands and knees I think I see movement so I lean down and stick my arm under, turning my face away to reach further towards the back. As my fingers probe into dusty cobwebs and forgotten pieces of discarded food I think I hear a rustle and call out to her again.

""Getting real tired of this, Pea."" 

She responds with a soft growling whine, somehow coming from in front of me. I turn my head and see her tense body crouched in the darkness under the coffee table. Did she sneak around behind me when I was bending down to reach under the couch?

Before I can react she thunders past my face like a woolly freight train, scattering trash and stray hairs like a smoke bomb. She streaks down the hall and around the corner, yowling and hissing the whole way. I hear her collide with a door as I shoot to my feet, ignoring the searing pain in my heel to sprint after her as the sounds of her own struggle intensify. I round the corner to the sound of a dull thud that precludes a heavy silence and come to a sudden halt.

The door to the hall closet is open.

I don't know how long I was standing there but the thought of Sweet Pea laying on the floor with a broken neck, an accusatory glare with vacant eyes, snaps me out of it and I step into the threshold. The closet looks just as I remember with one small difference. A small cardboard box has fallen off of the shelf and lay slanted in the corner. The side that was labelled is facing away but I don't need to see it to know which box it is. 

I don't even realize I've been slowly backing away until a shard of ceramic embedded in my heel makes contact with the baseboard in the hallway, sending a bright bolt of pain up my spine that snaps me out of my daze. I realize now that the perfect silence has been broken as a low growl emanates from just underneath me.

I can't begin to describe the relief I feel when I look down and see Sweet Pea hunched at my feet staring into the darkness of the hall closet. I swiftly close the closet door and bend down to pick her up, wincing as the pain in my leg begins to really make itself at home. Surprisingly she doesn't complain as I escort her to the bathroom for first aid.

I'm not a Vet but as far as I can tell she has no injuries, save for one small patch of fur missing on her flank. I assume that's from running into the closet door so hard it popped open. Her eyes are clear and alert, and she hasn't had any more episodes the whole time I was pulling shards of coffee cup out of my foot. My best guess is she had a reaction to something in the treat Ruth fed her earlier, God only knows what the hell it's made of, and it seems to have worn off. If I see any other strange behaviors tomorrow I'll get her looked at but for now I'm eager to put this night behind me. On the way out of the bathroom I pause at the hall closet and, without turning to look, gently turn the small lock on the handle.

Maybe Sweet Pea can sleep in my bedroom tonight, just this once.",1,1757298165.0,Odd_directions,1,1.0,False

Cooking (Like a lot)

Coffee (Would have still been obsessed with it if not for my espresso machine breaking down)

Art (Movies, Shows, Making it, etc...)

Horror (Movies, Shows, Halloween, Art, Etc...)

Board games & Video Games

Thrifting

Eating at new places

Exploring new areas

Watching movies and shows

Animals

Being social (Until I inevitably want to avoid everyone lol)

* gentle domme switch 
* strong personality, introvert, big BIG texter, straightforward
* stable career
* some interests I have: caring for dogs & cats, gaming (currently playing Zelda totk), F1, coffee, exercising, flowers

**The person I'm looking for:**

* service top sub | looking for my knight (his queen & her knight)
* someone who loves/ open to plus-size body types

* non-smoker & ddf

* don't jump into a dynamic meaning don't call me mistress, mommy, etc immediately 
* have the intention of wanting to be friends with me/get to know me first before moving on to a relationship. 
* know that I like daily consistent texting to build the friendship so hopefully you can give me that
