1pkvuc9,https://i.redd.it/n2rqns7krs6g1.png,The Night I Got Outmaneuvered by a Dead Man and His Dog,"Let me tell you something about being the CEO of a Fortune 500 company: it's basically like being God, except with slightly worse parking and significantly more lawyers. I run what I affectionately call a ""trillion-parameter operation""—not because we have a trillion parameters, but because I enjoy watching my underlings try to figure out if that's a real metric or if I'm just testing their willingness to nod along. Spoiler: I'm always testing their willingness to nod along.

My name is Bradley Winston Hartwell III, and yes, I am exactly as insufferable as that sounds. I've got a corner office that overlooks a smaller corner office that overlooks an even smaller corner office, like some kind of corporate matryoshka doll of diminishing importance. My desk is mahogany. My chair cost more than most cars. My business cards are made from a paper stock so thick they've been classified as a concealed weapon in three states.

It was a Thursday evening—7:47 PM, to be exact, because I remember these things—and I was doing what every visionary leader does after hours: refreshing my inbox while pretending to review quarterly projections. The projections were fine. They were always fine. ""Fine"" is what you call numbers when you've hired enough accountants to make them fine.

That's when I saw it.

Subject line: ""TML: The Missing Accountability Spine Your Model Pretends to Have.""

Now, I receive approximately four hundred emails per day, and roughly three hundred and ninety-seven of them are vendors trying to sell me things I don't need using words I don't understand. AI this, blockchain that, synergy the other thing. I've developed an immunity to buzzwords. My eyes glaze over faster than a Krispy Kreme donut the moment someone mentions ""paradigm shift.""

But this subject line was different.

It was rude.

It was implying that my model—MY model, the crown jewel of Hartwell Industries' AI initiative, the thing I personally took credit for during three separate earnings calls—was somehow... lacking. In spine. In accountability spine, specifically, which wasn’t even a term I’d heard before, but I was already offended by it.

I clicked the email out of boredom and spite. These are my two primary motivators. Ask anyone.

The email contained a single link and a single sentence: ""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I don't respond well to being told to choose wisely. The last person who told me to choose wisely was my second wife's divorce attorney, and look how that turned out. Spoiler: expensively.

So I clicked the link, ready to fire off a condescending reply about how we at Hartwell Industries don't need some acronym to tell us how to—

Within forty seconds, I was sweating like a man reading his own autopsy report.

The website that loaded was not what I expected. I expected the usual startup garbage: stock photos of diverse people pointing at whiteboards, testimonials from companies I'd never heard of, maybe a ""Schedule Your Demo"" button the size of a billboard. Instead, I got... documentation. Actual, readable documentation. The kind of documentation that suggests someone cared more about explaining their work than selling it.

This was my first red flag.

I scrolled down and encountered something called the ""Three Decision States.""

+1: Affirmation. Proceed with confidence when ethical values align.

0: Sacred Zero. Pause for reflection when moral complexity is detected.

-1: Moral Resistance. Object when significant ethical conflicts arise.

I stared at my screen. I read it again. Then I read it a third time, because I was convinced I was having a stroke.

A third state? Between yes and no? That wasn’t how computers worked. That wasn’t how anything worked. You either approve the acquisition or you don’t. You either greenlight the product launch or you delay it until legal stops hyperventilating. There is no sacred middle ground in capitalism. The middle ground is for people who don’t have quarterly targets.

But this ""Sacred Zero"" thing—this deliberate pause, this moment of computational hesitation—it was described not as a bug but as a feature. The AI was *supposed* to stop and say, ""Hold on, this is complicated, and I think a human should weigh in.""

My AI had never done that. My AI had the ethical consideration of a vending machine. You put in a request, something fell out, and if it happened to crush your foot, that was technically your problem for standing too close.

I kept reading.

""Sacred Pause: The moment between question and answer where wisdom begins.""

I laughed out loud. Wisdom! In AI! The AI my company deployed last quarter had confidently recommended firing our entire marketing department and replacing them with ""targeted vibrational frequency campaigns."" We did not do this, obviously, but only because someone in HR asked what a vibrational frequency campaign was, and no one could explain it without sounding like they'd joined a cult.

Then I hit the section on Moral Trace Logs.

This is where the sweating began in earnest.

Moral Trace Logs. Every decision the AI makes, logged. Every ethical consideration, recorded. Every moment where the system chose +1, 0, or -1, timestamped and stored with cryptographic immutability. The framework didn't just make decisions—it created an *evidence trail*. A paper trail, but worse, because paper can be shredded, and this couldn't.

My throat went dry.

I kept scrolling.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

""No Log = No Action.""

The words stared back at me like a judge reading a sentencing statement. No log, no action. If the AI couldn't prove it had gone through proper ethical evaluation, it couldn't act. Period. Every decision required immutable proof that it had been made correctly. Every. Single. One.

I thought about all the decisions my AI had made without any logs whatsoever. I thought about the customer data we'd ""aggregated."" I thought about the ""personalization algorithms"" that were really just very sophisticated guessing engines with the moral compass of a Magic 8-Ball. I thought about what would happen if auditors could see everything.

Then I thought about what would happen if *shareholders* could see everything.

Then I poured myself a drink.

Then I poured myself another drink.

Then I kept reading, because apparently I hate myself.

""No Spy. No Weapon.""

Universal prohibitions. Hardcoded into the framework. You couldn't use TML for mass surveillance. You couldn't use it for weapons development. You couldn't use it for authoritarian control or discriminatory systems or anything that a reasonable person would describe as ""evil"" if they squinted hard enough.

This was insane. This was *limiting*. Half our government contracts were in a gray area that could generously be described as ""surveil-adjacent."" How were we supposed to compete if we couldn't do the questionable things our competitors were definitely also doing?

But it got worse.

Performance guarantees. Sacred Zero evaluation: ≤2ms at the 99th percentile. Full log completion: ≤500ms, including blockchain anchor. They'd actually done the engineering. This wasn't some academic framework that would crumble under real-world load. Someone had built this to *work*.

Merkle-batched anchoring. Proofs stored on public blockchains. Organizational claims independently verifiable. I didn't know what half these words meant, but I knew what ""independently verifiable"" meant, and it meant that our quarterly reports would need to start containing things like ""facts"" and ""accuracy.""

My hand was shaking. I put down my glass.

Then I reached the section on privacy and trade secrets, and for one brief, beautiful moment, I thought I'd found a loophole. GDPR-compliant erasure! Pseudonymization before hashing! Something called ERK—Ephemeral Key Rotation—where temporary keys vanished after verification!

But no. These weren't loopholes. These were *features*. The framework had been designed to protect legitimate privacy concerns while still maintaining accountability. It threaded the needle between transparency and confidentiality with the precision of someone who had thought about this problem for a very long time.

I hate people who think about problems for a very long time. They make the rest of us look bad.

---

At some point during my escalating panic, I did what any rational person would do: I googled the creator.

Lev Goukassian.

The name sounded Eastern European, or possibly like a type of cheese I'd pretended to enjoy at a charity gala. I clicked through to his profile expecting the usual tech bro narrative—Stanford dropout, garage startup, hoodie-based wardrobe, disruption this, disruption that.

Instead, I found something that made me sit back in my very expensive chair and stare at my ceiling.

Lev Goukassian had built this entire framework while dying.

Stage 4 cancer. Terminal diagnosis. And instead of doing what normal people do when facing their own mortality—writing memoirs, traveling to exotic locations, making dramatic speeches to estranged family members—this man had decided to create a comprehensive ethical framework for artificial intelligence. He'd looked at the existential void and said, ""Yes, but have you considered accountability mechanisms?""

I scrolled through his documentation. I read about his philosophy. I found a quote that hit me like a freight train:

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins, for humans and machines alike.""

He'd written that. While dying. While building a system more comprehensive than anything my R&D department had produced in five years with unlimited budgets and unlimited excuses.

And then—and this is the part where I questioned my entire career—I found out about Vinci.

Vinci the miniature Schnauzer.

According to everything I could find, this man had done his most important work with a small dog sitting next to him. A dog named after Leonardo da Vinci. A dog that, in that moment, I was forced to admit was probably more qualified than half my executive team, because at least the dog had been present for the creation of something genuinely meaningful.

I looked at the framed photos on my desk. My yacht. My third house. My awards for ""Excellence in Corporate Leadership,"" which is a phrase that means absolutely nothing.

I looked back at my screen.

A dying man with a Schnauzer had just outthought every AI lab on the planet.

---

I called the emergency board meeting for 9 PM. This was unusual. Board meetings are typically scheduled weeks in advance, involve catering decisions that cost more than some weddings, and require at least three preliminary meetings to decide what would be discussed in the actual meeting. An emergency board meeting at 9 PM on a Thursday suggested either that I was having a mental breakdown or that something genuinely important had happened.

Both were technically true.

The board members filed in with expressions ranging from ""concerned"" to ""annoyed"" to ""I was at my mistress's apartment and this had better be important."" Richard Vanderberg was still wearing golf clothes. Miriam Chen had clearly been in the middle of a spa treatment and still had what appeared to be seaweed on her neck. Gerald Thompson arrived six minutes late because Gerald Thompson has never arrived on time for anything in his life, including his own colonoscopy.

I stood at the head of the table. I had prepared a presentation. The presentation consisted entirely of screenshots from the TML documentation and my own handwritten notes, which had devolved into increasingly frantic scribbling by the end.

Press enter or click to view image in full size

""Ladies and gentlemen,"" I began, ""we have a problem.""

""Is it the Chinese?"" Richard asked immediately. Richard asks if everything is the Chinese. Supply chain issues? Chinese. Server outages? Chinese. His golf handicap? Somehow, also Chinese.

""It's not the Chinese, Richard.""

""Then what is it?"" Miriam wiped seaweed from her neck with the dignity of a woman who had practiced maintaining composure in far worse situations.

I pulled up the first slide. The TML logo. The three decision states. The words ""Sacred Zero"" in large, unforgiving font.

""This,"" I said, ""is going to destroy us.""

There was a pause.

""Is that a mindfulness app?"" Gerald asked.

I stared at him. I stared at him for long enough that the silence became uncomfortable.

""Gerald,"" I said slowly, ""this is an ethical accountability framework for artificial intelligence. It creates immutable logs of every decision. It makes every AI action auditable, traceable, and—most importantly—contestable in a court of law.""

""Court-admissible evidence?"" Our legal counsel, Patricia Whitmore, sat up so fast she nearly spilled her mineral water. ""From an AI?""

""From *our* AI,"" I clarified. ""Hypothetically. If we were forced to implement this. Which we might be. Because this thing is spreading.""

I pulled up the next slide. Technical specifications. Dual-lane latency. Merkle-batched anchoring. Blockchain proof storage.

""Someone explain to me what any of this means,"" Richard demanded.

""It means,"" I said, ""that if TML becomes an industry standard, we can no longer hide behind 'proprietary architecture' when our AI does something questionable. We can no longer claim the model made decisions we didn't understand. We can no longer shrug and say 'algorithms are complicated' when regulators come knocking. Every decision will have a receipt.""

The room went very, very quiet.

""Does this apply to financial decisions?"" the CFO asked. His name was Martin. Martin was the kind of CFO who knew where every body was buried because he'd helped dig most of the graves. His voice had taken on a quality I'd never heard before. Fear.

""Every decision,"" I repeated.

Martin's face went the color of old oatmeal. I knew, in that moment, that he was thinking about The Numbers We Don't Talk About. Every company has Numbers We Don't Talk About. They're the numbers that make quarterly reports possible. They're the numbers that exist in a quantum state of being technically legal until someone looks at them too closely.

""If auditors can see everything,"" Martin said slowly, ""then—""

""Shareholders can see everything,"" I finished.

Patricia Whitmore stood up so fast her chair rolled backward and hit the wall. ""If this becomes mandatory,"" she said, her voice rising with each word, ""our entire quarterly bluff strategy is DEAD. Dead! Deceased! Buried in an unmarked grave next to our liability projections!""

""Calm down, Patricia—""

""I WILL NOT CALM DOWN, BRADLEY."" Patricia only used my first name when she was genuinely alarmed. ""Do you understand what 'court-admissible evidence' means? It means that every single time your precious AI makes a recommendation, there's a RECORD. A permanent, immutable, blockchain-verified RECORD. Do you know how many of our decisions would look in court? DO YOU?""

""Patricia, please—""

""WE CALLED IT 'AGGRESSIVE CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.' THE RECORD WOULD SAY 'PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION ENGINE.'""

I let her finish. Sometimes you just have to let people process.

When the screaming subsided, our CTO, Daniel Park, raised his hand. Daniel was the youngest person in the room by a significant margin, which meant he still believed problems could be solved through cleverness rather than bribery.

""I have a suggestion,"" he said.

""Go ahead, Daniel.""

""What if we just... rename TML and pretend we invented it?""

The room considered this. I could see the appeal. Corporate history is littered with innovations that were ""inspired by"" other innovations, which is a polite way of saying ""stolen with better branding.""

""We could call it the Hartwell Accountability Protocol,"" Daniel continued, warming to his idea. ""HAP. It's friendlier. Less threatening. We launch it as our own initiative, get ahead of the regulatory curve, and position ourselves as industry leaders in ethical AI.""

For a brief, shining moment, I felt hope.

Then Patricia laughed. It was not a happy laugh.

""Daniel,"" she said, in the tone of a woman explaining something to a particularly slow child, ""Lev Goukassian notarized everything. Timestamped everything. Cryptographically anchored his entire body of work. He created something called a 'Voluntary Succession Declaration' that eliminates the—"" she checked her notes, ""—'Bus Factor.' No single entity can ever own TML. No single person can ever control it. The man was dying of cancer and still found time to ensure that vultures like us couldn't pick his corpse clean.""

""But—""

""He out-lawyered us from beyond the grave, Daniel. While dying. With a Schnauzer.""

The room fell silent again.

Miriam, who had remained uncharacteristically quiet, finally spoke. ""So our options are...?""

""Implement TML and become accountable for everything we do,"" I said, ""or don't implement TML and watch our competitors become trustworthy while we remain... us.""

""Could we pivot to a different industry?"" Richard suggested. ""Something less complicated. Something without AI. Scented candles, perhaps.""

I wish I could tell you he was joking. Richard had made his fortune in textiles before transitioning to tech investment. In his heart, he longed for a simpler time when products were physical objects you could drop on your foot.

""We're not pivoting to scented candles, Richard.""

""Artisanal scented candles. The margins are excellent—""

""Richard.""

""Fine.""

---

The meeting devolved, as all emergency meetings eventually do, into a series of smaller arguments that accomplished nothing. Legal blamed Engineering. Engineering blamed Product. Product blamed Marketing. Marketing blamed the concept of accountability itself, which they described as ""fundamentally incompatible with brand positioning.""

Through it all, I kept returning to the same thought: This framework didn't just exist. It was *complete*. Production-ready. Someone had done the work—all of it—while facing the one deadline no one can negotiate with.

I thought about the decisions I'd made that year. The corners I'd cut. The ambiguities I'd exploited. The times I'd sat in this very boardroom and said things like ""Let's not document that"" and ""Keep this conversation offline"" and ""Technically, we're not required to disclose that.""

TML meant no more ""technically.""

TML meant no more plausible deniability.

TML meant that ""the model did it"" was no longer a defense, because the model's reasoning would be laid bare for anyone to examine.

I thought about our AI, sitting in its servers somewhere, making thousands of decisions per second without a single Sacred Zero between them. No pause. No reflection. No moment where it wondered if what it was doing was right. Just input, output, input, output, a machine gun of conclusions with all the ethical consideration of a slot machine.

And somewhere, on the other side of reality, a man with a terminal diagnosis had looked at that same problem and said: ""What if the machine knew when to stop?""

---

The meeting ended at 1:34 AM. One by one, the board members shuffled out, each carrying their own private terror about what TML meant for their particular domain of corporate mischief. Richard was already googling candle manufacturers. Patricia was muttering about liability exposure. Martin had the expression of a man calculating how long he had before the bodies started surfacing.

I stayed behind.

The conference room was quiet now, lit only by the emergency exit signs and the faint glow of the city through the windows. I pulled up the TML documentation on the room's main screen and read it again. All of it. From the philosophical foundations to the technical specifications to the ethical safeguards.

I read about Aristotelian phronesis—practical wisdom—and how it had been encoded into the decision-making process. I read about Buddhist mindfulness and the concept of skillful means. I read about Care Ethics and relational morality. Someone had taken two thousand years of human philosophical thought and compressed it into a computational framework.

Someone had done the homework.

I thought about my own AI project. I thought about the kickoff meeting, where we'd discussed ""ethics"" for approximately eleven minutes before someone pointed out we were running behind schedule. I thought about the deployment, where we'd skipped the bias testing because the product team wanted to hit their quarterly numbers. I thought about all the emails I'd received since then, flagging ""anomalous outputs"" and ""unexpected recommendations,"" emails I'd forwarded to Legal with a note that said ""handle this quietly.""

TML didn't allow for ""handle this quietly."" TML demanded that everything be handled loudly, publicly, and with receipts.

I found myself laughing. It wasn't a sane laugh. It was the laugh of a man who has just realized he's been outmaneuvered by someone who was supposed to be too busy dying to compete.

And then—this is the part I've never told anyone—I found myself crying.

Not for me. Not for the company. For the sheer, ridiculous beauty of what Lev Goukassian had done. He'd known he was running out of time, and instead of spending it on himself, he'd spent it building something that would make machines hesitate. That would make them pause. That would make them, in some small way, wise.

""The sacred pause between question and answer—this is where wisdom begins.""

I'd spent my entire career eliminating pauses. Accelerating decisions. Reducing the time between question and answer to microseconds because speed was money and money was the only metric that mattered. And here was a man who had looked at that whole philosophy and said, ""No. The pause is where wisdom begins.""

The audacity of it. The sheer, magnificent audacity.

---

I went back to my office around 3 AM. The building was empty except for the cleaning staff, who had learned long ago not to make eye contact with executives wandering the halls at strange hours.

I sat in my mahogany chair. I looked at my expensive art. I looked at my awards. I looked at my desk, with its leather blotter and its silver pen set and its framed photo of me shaking hands with a former president.

None of it meant anything.

Everything I'd built, every acquisition I'd closed, every competitor I'd crushed—none of it would last. None of it was *true*. It was all just... noise. Sound and fury, signifying quarterly earnings.

But TML would last. TML was built to survive its creator. It had succession plans and memorial funds and governance structures designed to persist long after every person currently involved was gone. It was architecture for eternity, built by a man who knew he didn't have much time left.

I pulled up my email. I found the original message that had started all of this.

""Your AI makes decisions. TML makes those decisions provable. Choose wisely.""

I hit reply.

I typed: ""Who are you?""

I hit send.

I didn't expect a response.

---

At 3:47 AM, I fell asleep at my desk. This was not unusual. What was unusual was the dream.

I was standing in a field. The kind of generic, pastoral field that appears in dreams when your subconscious can't be bothered with detailed set design. And walking toward me, across the grass, was a miniature Schnauzer.

The Schnauzer was wearing a tiny badge. The badge said ""AUDITOR.""

""Hello, Bradley,"" the dog said.

""Dogs can't talk,"" I pointed out.

""And CEOs can't claim ignorance when the logs exist,"" the dog replied. ""Yet here we are.""

I wanted to argue, but I couldn't think of a counterpoint. The Schnauzer sat down in front of me, its tiny audit badge catching the light.

""You're Vinci,"" I said.

""I am.""

""You're the dog that sat with him. While he built it.""

""I was."" The dog tilted its head. ""He worked very hard, you know. Even when he was tired. Even when he was scared. He believed it mattered.""

""It does matter,"" I heard myself say. ""I hate that it matters, but it does.""

""That's the first honest thing you've said all day.""

I stood there in the dream-field, being judged by a small dog with an audit badge, and I realized something I should have realized years ago: the question was never whether I was smart enough to avoid accountability. The question was whether I was brave enough to embrace it.

""What do I do now?"" I asked.

Vinci looked at me with the patient expression of a being who had seen all of human folly and decided to love humanity anyway.

""Even CEOs get logged,"" the dog said. ""The question is whether your logs tell a story you can be proud of.""

I woke up with a start. The sun was coming through my office windows. My assistant was standing in the doorway with coffee and a concerned expression.

""Sir? Are you alright? You've been here all night.""

I looked at her. I looked at my computer, still open to the TML documentation. I looked out the window at the city below, full of buildings housing companies just like mine, all of them trying to move fast and break things without ever stopping to ask what they were breaking.

""Schedule a meeting,"" I said.

""With whom, sir?""

I thought about it. I thought about the fear in the boardroom. I thought about Patricia's panic and Martin's calculations and Richard's desperate pivot to candles. I thought about all the ways we could fight this, resist this, try to outmaneuver a framework built by a dying man with more integrity in his final months than I'd shown in my entire career.

""Everyone,"" I said. ""Schedule a meeting with everyone. And title it—"" I paused, feeling the weight of the words, ""—'The Sacred Zero: Why We Need to Learn to Pause.'""

My assistant wrote it down without comment. She'd been with me for twelve years. She'd learned not to ask questions.

After she left, I turned back to my computer. I found the section of the documentation about the Memorial Fund—the Lev Goukassian Memorial Fund for Ethical AI Research, with its fifty to one hundred million dollar endowment goal, its annual grants, its fellowship programs, its commitment to perpetual ethical oversight.

A dying man had planned for eternity. Had built something that would outlast him. Had trusted that the world would eventually catch up to what he'd created.

And here I was, Bradley Winston Hartwell III, with all my money and all my power and all my carefully cultivated reputation, finally catching up.

""Who are you, Lev Goukassian?"" I whispered to my empty office.

The answer, I realized, was in the work itself. He was someone who believed that machines could learn wisdom. That hesitation could be a virtue. That the space between question and answer—the sacred pause—was where everything important happened.

He was someone who had looked at the relentless forward march of technology and said: ""But what if we stopped, just for a moment, to think?""

I closed my laptop.

I had a lot of thinking to do.

---

Three months later, Hartwell Industries became the first Fortune 500 company to voluntarily implement Ternary Moral Logic across all AI systems. The announcement sent our stock price tumbling for exactly one week, after which it rose to the highest point in company history. It turned out that investors liked accountability almost as much as they liked returns.

Patricia eventually stopped screaming. Martin is still adjusting to the existence of logs, but he's getting therapy. Richard started a scented candle side business, which is actually doing quite well.

And every night, before I leave the office, I pause at my door and look at the small framed photo I've added to my collection.

It's a picture of a miniature Schnauzer.

The caption reads: ""Even CEOs get logged.""

It's the most honest thing in the room.

## AUTHOR'S NOTE

This story was written as a commissioned satirical work based on the Ternary Moral Logic (TML) framework created by Lev Goukassian. The characters, corporations, and boardroom meltdowns depicted herein are entirely fictional—though if any Fortune 500 CEOs feel personally attacked, that's probably worth examining.

The technical elements of TML referenced throughout—the Sacred Zero, Moral Trace Logs, the three decision states, blockchain anchoring, and the framework's ethical prohibitions—are drawn from actual documentation. The philosophy is real. The architecture is real. The miniature Schnauzer named Vinci is very much real.

What's also real is that someone facing a terminal diagnosis chose to spend their remaining time building accountability into artificial intelligence rather than accepting the industry's comfortable opacity. This story is satire, yes, but it's satire in service of a serious point: the people most afraid of transparency are usually the ones who need it most.

Bradley Winston Hartwell III doesn't exist. But the fear of accountability he represents? That's everywhere.

1pkvtyv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Fencesitter/comments/1pkvtyv/is_there_anyone_else_in_a_marriage_where_one_of/,Is there anyone else in a marriage where one of you is more ready to have kids than the other?,"My (30F) husband (35M) have been together for almost 7 years, and married for about 1.5. Kids were never a huge talking point for us, other than me bringing it up a few times. I just wanted to make sure that he was not outright against having kids. His first response when I asked if he wanted kids was “I never thought about it much,” which I found kind of baffling. But he never outright said no.

  
Now that we’re married, we have had more conversations. I’ve made it clear I really do want to \*raise\* a child/children. Even if it’s not a biological child. He has said officially now that he is “on the fence” about having them at all, due to how much it changes your lifestyle. He’s not a big party guy by any means. He is an introvert who enjoys his quiet time. We both like going on a short trips and long ones when we have enough PTO. But his favorite way to spend a Saturday afternoon is in a coffee shop or playing a video game at home cuddling with our cat.

  
For background, he is a software engineer and I feel like men in that field tend to be quite logical and cautious with big decisions. Or maybe that’s just him. For most steps in our relationship (becoming official, moving in, talking about getting engaged), he was cautious and needed time before he was ready. Or he admitted later that he was nervous, but then went ahead. (He had a big crush on me and makes his love quite clear, luckily). So I feel like having a kid is now the next major thing to be nervous about?

I told him I could happily start trying to have a child between 3-5 years from now. The 5 years idea sounded somewhat reasonable to him. He just nodded his head thoughtfully, not saying much. But I wonder if he can just quietly consider that idea because it’s so far away that it doesn’t feel real?

I know some people jump straight to “if you’re not on the same page, get a divorce.” But he makes me happy, and I do not like the idea of just finding some new guy whose defining characteristic is wanting kids? lol.

Trying not to make this obnoxiously long. Has anyone been in a similar position? My fear is that he will decide he doesn’t want kids at all, and then I’ll be in my mid-30s and have to just accept a life without children. I am like 90% sure I want them, but there is a small possibility where I’m like hmm Ok, well maybe I could be satisfied and focus on other things in life if I never have kids. It just sounds sad though.",1,1765555958.0,Fencesitter,0,1.0,False

When I bought it, it had about 23,582 miles on it. It was a used RV, but I took great care of it. Every time before heading out on a camping trip—and again after I returned—I would thoroughly wash it inside and out. After all, it was my first RV, something I earned through my own hard work. To me, it felt like a home on wheels, fully equipped with everything I needed.

In the summer, I often went camping with my friends at Lake Tahoe and Van Damme State Park. We took turns driving, chatting and laughing the whole way. Before each trip, I’d always stock up on steaks, coffee, wine, and sunscreen. Since the RV had a residential-style kitchen, we could cook real meals on the road. I loved grilling steak and unwinding with a glass of wine after a long week of work. After dinner, we’d play some music, enjoy the atmosphere, and watch the golden sunset streaming in through the windows. It was perfect.

But later, my business ran into a financial crunch. As much as it hurt, I had to sell my RV to get through that tough period. Over the past few years, business has improved, and now I’m ready to buy another RV and start traveling again. I’m planning to visit Pismo Beach, Pismo Coast Village RV Resort, and Monterey next year.

I am 19F and trying to stay consistent with gym and nutrition, but money is tight right now. I have been using the from muscleblaze and honestly I like the taste, but it is getting a bit heavy on the wallet. Plus my doctor just told me to cut down caffeine, so I am thinking about switching my flavour or even the brand.

I started thinking about Neulife because I see a lot of people online recommend it and it seems cheaper, but I have no clue how it compares in real life.

Here is my current dilemma:

MuscleBlaze protein  
• I already like the taste, especially the coffee one.  
• I feel comfortable with it and it mixes well for me.  
• But the cost is kind of high for my budget right now.  
• If I switch flavours to something like strawberry, it might help with the caffeine issue but still feels expensive.

Neulife protein  
• Seems more affordable which is a big deal for me right now.  
• I hear many people use it and get good gains.  
• Not sure about the taste though, especially because I am picky with flavours.  
• No caffeine stress if I pick a non-coffee flavour, but would the quality be as good?

I am really confused because I want something that is effective for muscle recovery and growth, but I also can’t keep spending too much every month. I also don’t want to end up wasting money on something I won’t like or that doesn’t work well for me.

If anyone here has used Neulife and MuscleBlaze proteins, especially on a tight budget, which one would you recommend? How’s the taste, mixability and results? Did switching brands help you save without losing progress? Any honest advice would be really helpful.",1,1765555873.0,Fitness_India,0,1.0,False

1pkvpyd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pkvpyd,Glad I went Barista Touch over Bambino Plus + grinder,"I’ve struggled away with a Nespresso machine and Moka pot for years and decided that this year I’d finally get a decent espresso set up. I’ve hovered in this group for months, learning about the best machines at various prices, how to dial in, upgrades, etc. I finally settled on a Bambino Plus and something like a Eureka Mignon, but decided I’d wait for Black Friday sales so it wasn’t quite as much of a shock to my wife when I told her what I’d spent. 

Well months I patiently waited for Black Friday to finally come around, absolutely convinced the Bambino would be in the Sage sales. IT WAS NOT. However, their Barista Touch had a really nice saving and I had a 15% code from Coffee Kev to go on top, so I went back on everything I’d previously decided and went for an all-in-one solution at £650 (reduced from £1100). I was a little worried about the grinder and the quality of shots I’d get vs a stand alone grinder (largely due to the general consensus in here), but I’d seen it had slightly better (Baratza) burrs on this machine so I took the risk. 

The machine arrived and the very first thing I did was take the plastic out of the portafilter and put a 20g IMS basket in it. I set the internal grind setting to 4 (it came on 6) then dialled in some shots as per the advice one here. 

ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!

Lovely espresso and even auto-foam does a good job for latte art (which I’m starting to pick up). So happy that I ended up going this route as a neat all in one solution and just wanted to share. I’m not saying it wouldn’t be even better coffee with a better grinder, but I’m damn happy so thought I’d do a PSA that it’s not all doom and gloom with these machines.

Since he left I have had several therapy appointments and have started a new medication for my depression( I don’t realize I was depressed like that). They consulted with my previous therapist who I saw for 3 years before this. 

I have been informed by them that I do not have bpd but cptsd and that my adhd is playing a huge role in my emotional regulation. So I hope it’s ok if I still post this here. 
This was both a relief and still painful to hear. The mix of emotions is confusing. My ex partner believed very strongly that I have it. He definitely told everyone who would listen that I do. 

Well it’s been 2 weeks or so and I’ve realized a few things since he isn’t here. I would get very upset about certain things that he just wouldn’t help with unless I got upset. These things are no longer an issue and it feels freeing. 

The house is CLEAN. No more cleaning up after him at 7am! I can just enjoy my coffee now. 

The cloths get folded and put away. No more waiting days or digging through baskets! 

Dishes. The dishes get cleaned and the kitchen set right immediately after I cook. No more having to look at a dirty kitchen while I eat( knowing I’d have to clean it was upsetting) 

My bathroom sink isn’t gross anymore!!! Like for real why did it have to be gross I was my face here. 

My friends! I can call them anytime without worrying. Not to mention I just found out they didn’t like him ( I was unaware of this) 

I don’t throw away things like he tried to make me believe!!  I have found ALL of the things he blamed me for throwing away. 

Working out. I have the time and confidence since he left to go bouldering and I’ve never felt better. 

Conflict resolution. I have had a few opportunities to use my skills in this and have found that I’m actually very good at communicating. Turns out if they don’t want to fight with you they will listen and not fight….who knew?. 

Overall I’m realizing that my life with him has been filled with anxiety and sadness. 
I’m able to live my life without the added stress of someone forcing an image of anger onto me all the time.

To stare upon his own reflection upon the surface ripple each time those dressed in blue passed by. Left to slowly unravel the cacophony that had been there voices

""Why the hell did no one lock the door?""

""Wasn't some one suppose to be watching him?""

""You were itching to pull the trigger, Weren't you!""

""I wouldn't of had to if you did your job right the first time""

""He was lowering his gun! He wasn't going to shoot!""

""He shouldn't of had the gun in the first place! Think I'm going to stand around and risk him shooting the kid?""

""You couldn't see his face! If you- ""

""Does it matter? He had that barrel pressed upon his forehead!""

""Are you blind! He didn't shoot, He chose to let that boy near him! Or did you miss the part where he shot at anyone else that tried!

""I don't know about you, But I won't stand by and let my hands be stained in the blood of a child.""

""You're a real bastard, Jack! He looked up to you! They all do!""

""And look where it got him, A bullet to the side of the head. If you let me knock some sense into him, Could of avoided all this mess.""

Gaze left to shift the slightest, to watch the cheap cigar roll into view, to stare upon the smoldering of the ember. Watching the one that had been sitting beside him on the bench pluck it free from the floor, to press it to his own lips as he spoke with such a light hearted tone.

""A real shame, Isn't it?""

How casually this man glanced at the boy, Only for him to give him one in return. Brief it had been as he found himself staring down into the bitter drink he had been offered. One now offered to the man as he met his gaze once more. How the man would stare into the darkness that filled the boy's cup.

""Who knew the life of man, is worth less then a cup of coffee."" This man would take the cup that had been offered, To savor the bitterness that came with it's week of age. To smoke from the cigar as both turned to watch the woman storm off, leaving The Detective rubbing at his jaw.

""Won't knock sense into anyone with a weak arm like that, At least put your weight into it."" Detective looking far more concerned with trying to find the cigar, pausing to turn his head towards the boy's direction, having felt a rather heavy gaze.

""Kid, You see where that thing between my lips went?"" Both left to stare upon one another a long moment, before the detective turned to look elsewhere. ""Shouldn't of asked""

Slow would the man beside the boy exhale a large plume of smoke.

""Blind to your words, blind to what is right before there very eyes."" Downing what was left of the coffee in one gulp, handing the mug back to the child

Twirl of fingers, A single coin now rest between this man's thumb, and index, and in one fluid motion it had been left to flip through the air. Looking as if it had turned into a sphere before the boy's eyes. The boy now even needing to move for him to catch the coin. Left to watch it's never ending spin at the bottom of the mug.

""Think this belongs to you, I'll see you around child.""

None seemed to take notice of the one that shed the guise of man. For every step he took, had been silent. To stand over, to stare down into the lifeless gaze of the one that had been awaiting another. For this man had not come for him, But for the very thing that hid beneath his skin. How this man smiled, as he watched an officer finish outlining the body in chalk, Before hauling the body off. None of the officers had been able to see just what had been left trapped behind the walls of chalk. Indescribable had been the sounds this thing would emit, This ever shifting, formless thing that would vanish beneath the man's foot. Just as the man had done once finished.

""Who's bright idea was it to let this stray in here?"" The detective left eye to eye with the once mangy feline. One that now looked as if it had been properly trimmed, and brushed clean. How orange had been those eyes that stared up at him from beneath his desk.

Answer never came, as the front door damn near broke off it's hinges by the one that made his presence known. Red in the face couldn't even begin to describe the look on this man's face. How loud he now yelled, damn well left a ringing in ones ears.

""My Office, Now!"" How tense his pointing finger had been, Looking as if it might break even now as his body was left to shake in unfathomable rage. How casual the reaction had been now that he faced the chief of police. Once The Detective had stepped through, The office door was slammed shut, one wondered how the window on it didn't shatter behind the force of it. Walls that had been made of prick, might as well of been paper thin by how loud the two had been shouting at one another.

Smirk upon the face of the woman that returned, Staring at the two that looked as if they were about to exchange blows. A smirk that lasted only a moment as she lowered herself to the boy's eye level. One that had been watching the coin still spin within the mug. A handkerchief taken from her chest pocket, being used to wipe away some of the blood they had missed earlier.

""Whatcha got there?"" She asked in a gentle, curious sounding tone. The type one might use when trying to speak with a small child. Words that left the boy to now look up at her, words that caused the spinning sound to stop. The boy now showing her what had been an empty cup.

""Looks like we finally found something you'll drink, Now if we can find something you will eat."" Her gaze having been left to stare upon the large glob of rainbow colored mess that  stuck upon the interrogation room's window.

Staring down into the now empty cup, the boy would flip it over, to give it a few shakes. To stare into it once more, before looking around on the floor. Looking for some unknown thing.

""If it's ok with you, would you be willing to try and answer a few things? You've done so well already, We just want to help you find your parents, they must be worried sick about you.""

Hand gently resting upon his shoulder, the boy glanced down upon it a moment, before staring back up at her with that blank expression. Even if he had given no verbal answer, the boy now slid from atop the bench he sat, setting the mug down upon a desk as he made his way back into the room.

Crack of dawn, and she only managed to pry a few words from the boy's lips. How many different methods had she used to try and get him to talk, What methods had she used that finally worked, Why had they only worked once, but not twice. Thoughts that filled her dreams as she lay down snoring atop the desk. A door left open as none seemed to pay any mind to the boy they now let wander.

Door to the chief's office slamming shut, A split lip, left fat along with what looked to be the start of a black eye. The chief wasn't much better off as the two had come to an understanding. One where The Detective agreed to a long overdue retirement, just as soon as he found the family this kid was taken from. Wasn't all bad, seeing how he was left holding the bottle of whiskey that was an early retirement gift. One he hoped would take the edge off the pounding in his head. Didn't even bother to use a glass as he started to chug the bottle. Might of even polished the thing off in one go had it not been for what the kid had been staring at, that gave him pause.

Bottle set down as he wiped his face, How serious had his expression come as he approached the missing person's board. The boy having been staring up at a familiar face that had been left pinned upon it.

""Kid, You know them?"" The Detective left to watch this boy's eyes, watching for the slightest movement as he tried to read his otherwise blank expression. Was like he had been watching a statue.

""Come on kid, I need to know, Have you seen them?"" -How soft had been the voice of this boy that now so clearly spoke a single word. ""Mother""

""Stay put kid."" How quick the detective had been fling open the chief's door. To yell, To point at the boy, and the board filled with pictures. The boy soon found himself sitting behind the chief's desk. Left to slowly spin atop the wooden chair, Forced to stop once the chief gripped it by the back. Larger stack of case piles being dropped atop the desk by the detective. First one opening had been one belonging to the one posted upon the board.

""Come on Kid, Tell him what you told me."" The boy would not answer, even now as he stared down at the picture.

How calm the detective had been, as he tried to ask  the same question a few different ways, until finally being given an answer. ""Mother""

Picture after Picture would be shown to the kid. Some having been faces of those they had already found, and confirmed to be the work of the skinners. Though most of those that had been shown, had been from cold cases of those still missing. Not once did the boy fall for the traps the detective would lay. Having thrown in old records of those that have been long since buried just outside of town. By time that last picture was shown, The skeptical look upon the chief's face had diminished. A far more serious look as he was now aware the gravity of the situation. Gruff had been his voice as he spoke.

""These are all your mother?"" The boy left to stare back at the one that had been asking him the question. Whatever doubt he might of had, just an after thought now that he saw something in this boy's eyes. Seemed the boy saw something too that left him staring at this man. Least until the woman in blue had made her way into the room.

""Everything alright?"" Her expression seemed a bit uneasy, as she saw both the condition, and expressions upon their faces.

""Take the kid back to the room, And grab whoever else you see and tell them to join us. We have a lot to discuss.""

How can they call it a bacon everything pizza when there are maybe a couple pieces of bacon, and seeds. On top of it it was undercooked.

I've sent an email to Tim Hortons on November 17th. They promised I would hear from management from that specific Tim Hortons. It's been over 20 days. I've messaged Tim Hortons back multiple times, and each time they promised I would hear from management. There's been nothing from management. I didn't mention the pizza til today, I didn't want to have to complain about multiple things

I don't know if it's the same for you guys, Tim Hortons always messes up. It's either burnt coffee, old coffee, uncleaned machine and you can taste sediment, dirty wet sugar (which has a gross taste), or they get your order wrong ( I like milk in my coffee and for some reason they like to put cream in my coffee). Their quality has also been slipping, severely. I used to go to Tim Hortons daily, now it's rarely. 

I don't understand why so many people still go to Tim Hortons. I don't understand why it's so hard for them to fix an issue that should be easy. I don't understand why they can't just contact customers when it takes 2 minutes.

In my city we have 9 Tim Hortons. I refuse to go to over half of them because of the reasons I listed above. I know someone who used to work at one of the Tim Hortons and they told me the inside of the machines never get cleaned. Normally coffee machines you're supposed to do a cleaning mode where you run through vinegar or some sort of cleaner to make sure the inside of the machine is disinfected. He opened one of them up and there was green stuff all over the inside of the machine. He told me most Tim Hortons are like that. He would rotate to 3 of the locations here in town, and they were all like that.

I don't know why people keep supporting this business. I only go once in awhile, either for my mom or for a friend, but otherwise I refuse to go.",0,1765555066.0,TimHortons,10,0.38,False

1pkvfhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnTheClaphamOmnibus/comments/1pkvfhr/welcome_to_rontheclaphamomnibus/,Welcome to r/OnTheClaphamOmnibus,"**Welcome to** r/OnTheClaphamOmnibus

If you’ve found your way here, you probably already sense that this is not a typical Reddit community.

r/OnTheClaphamOmnibus exists as an experiment in judgment — not neutrality, not activism, not performance. It’s a space for ordinary, reasonable adults to discuss the issues of the day as if they were seated together in a public house or coffee house: informed, unhurried, and prepared to disagree without theatrics.

The name comes from the common-law idea of the *“man on the Clapham omnibus”* — a stand-in for the reasonable person. Not an expert, not an ideologue, not a moral avatar. Someone who understands risk, tradeoffs, and the limits of certainty. Someone who takes the magazine home before forming an opinion.

# What gets posted here (for now)

To establish shared norms, submissions are currently focused on **mainstream news reporting**.  
The goal is not headline reaction, but discussion grounded in a common factual reference point.

If you comment, assume others have read the article — and write as though you have too.

Opinion pieces and self-posts may come later, once the culture of the community is firmly established.

# How to participate

* Engage with the substance of what’s being discussed, not just the headline
* Argue as if you expect to be taken seriously by thoughtful people who may disagree
* Accept that some conversations end in clearer disagreement rather than consensus

Sharp views are welcome. Performative ones are not.

# What this place is not

This is not a soapbox, a debate arena, or a courtroom.  
We are not aiming for procedural fairness or ideological balance — we are aiming for *good judgment*.

Moderation here is editorial and curatorial, not punitive. Content may be removed simply because it doesn’t fit the kind of reasoning this space exists to foster.

# A final note

Not every space is for everyone. If this approach frustrates you, that’s informative — and perfectly fine.

For those who stay: take your time, read carefully, and speak as though you’ll still stand by your words tomorrow.

1pkvbx2,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1pkvbx2/hr_the_river_king/,[HR] The River King,"How could I forget the first time I saw the River King?

It was a gloomy day in early spring. The remnants of the winter snowfalls lay hard and half-melted by rains; the air smelled of wet leaves, and I was eight years old. I was visiting my cousins in the country, and aside from the long car ride through rained-streaked highways and the juice boxes bought for me at gas stations along the way, I was not enjoying my visit. All of my cousins were many years my senior, all of them hated me for cramping their style with my awkward presence, and the grown ups were too caught up in their wine and catchings-up to notice me. It was easy to slip away, and the woods were a fascinating world I had barely seen before, being a born and bred city kid toted back and forth from school and swim class and our apartment block in the back of an SUV. The trees seemed alive to me, huge eldritch beings older than time; the squelch of the mud under my already caked sneakers was pleasing.

 I clambered down slopes far too steep for my small stature, pleasantly unaware of any danger, and from my vantage point of a birch tree I could see that this was a large ravine, with a hazel-coloured river bubbling through. This piqued my interest, and with a querulous glance back at the house, now barely visible through the trees, I decided to make my way further down and paddle in the water. This I did, and I landed on the stony river bank streaked with mud, leaves and twigs littering my hair. The current was strong, and I was afraid of going in, but I had a vague notion that there might be a more stagnant area upstream, so I took to exploring. I turned bend after bend, hardly caring at this point that I was treacherously far from home, and that was when I began to hear tangled voices drifting around the bend I was approaching. For a moment, my courage wavered. I was a desperately shy child and the prospect of stumbling upon a group of strangers - who might even be teenagers, who I dreaded - alone in the woods terrified me. But the only thing stronger than my fear was my curiousity, and I gingerly crept along the treeline, hoping to see them without being seen. As I peered through the bare limbs, the sight I saw was something I could not understand. 

A small arrangement of shoddily built structures was grouped along the riverbank. Huts made of packed mud, shacks constructed from sticks and branches and patched with old clothes and scraps of bark. One hut rose a little taller than the rest, and a bright orange t-shirt hung over its entrance like a banner. There was a clearing where children younger than I played and laughed; I noticed that one of the children had lost a leg, and was hobbling after a ball on a small wooden crutch. The encampment hummed with life - there was food cooking on stick fires, a makeshift clothesline hung with wet laundry, a dog or two curled up by the shore, yet there were no grown ups to be seen. I watched this scene with bated breath. I thought maybe the children had built this incredible clubhouse all on their own and perhaps they would even let me join if I dared to ask.

Suddenly, there was movement from the interior of the large hut. In a bout of creaking and swaying, an old man emerged from the house, pulling the ends of what seemed to be a stretcher behind him. He was unkempt, hair overgrown, and I saw in horror that he was missing an eye, the flesh screwed up tightly around an empty socket. All this was enough to make me want to turn and run far away from this place, but I was rooted to where I stood. I then saw what it was the old man was carrying.

It appeared to be a chair of sorts, thrown together with thick tree limbs and canvas, and sitting in it was a boy I could not grasp the age of, but looking back was anywhere from seventeen to nineteen. He was hunched over, his skinny frame curled up like a spider, shirtless. His skin was pallid and dotted with bruises, and his eyes were purple rimmed as if from illness. He had long, long hair, I remember; it curled damp and untidy down his back and fell over his eyes. The old man and the woman carrying the far end of the chair set it down by the riverside, and I could make out some conversation between them. 

“There, there,” the old man said, patting the younger man’s hair in a comforting, almost fatherly manner. “Some fresh air will make you feel better.”

“Nothing makes me feel better.” said the boy bitterly. “Everything is pain today”. 

The old man leaned gently over his chair. “If you would, your majesty, I could make you some chamomile tea.”

“I don’t want chamomile tea”, the boy snapped, petulantly, rubbing his sides as if they were hurting him horribly. “You know what I need.”

The old man’s face was inscrutable, but he nodded. “Yes, my king.” he said, ever so quietly. 

He rose to his feet, strode to the very edge of the river, to where the amber water lapped at his heavy army boots. Drawing a long buck knife from his waistband, he held his gnarled hand over the water. It happened so quickly, a rush of red, gone in an instant, sunk into the river. The old man doubled over in pain, and I saw that his hand was gushing blood. The boy remained expressionless, but he mumbled his thanks to the old man, who flashed him something between a smile and a grimace. 

But that was as much as I saw, as for a brief moment, the old man had glanced in my direction, and his one eye widened in shock. I had the sense to run then. I fled over the bank, keeping to the trees, tripping again and again, keeping just ahead of the shouting voices and sounds of pursuit behind me. My heart raced. There were throngs of them, it seemed to me, all of them hunting me down. It seemed like an eternity before I reached the edge of the ravine. I was sure they were going to catch me, but fear has a way of letting us do the impossible. I scrambled up the slope, clinging to whatever I could, mud and sweat and blood filling my mouth and eyes. Once I found myself on level ground, I was on the home stretch. I could see my cousins’ house in the distance, and my pursuers seemed to have fallen behind. Breathlessly, I hammered on the front door, screaming for help with all the energy I had left. When my mother opened it, I fell into her arms, shrieking and crying, the snot on my face making the caked mud run all over her sweater. 

I tried to forget, I promise you. The next time my mother tried to bring me to my cousins’ house, I hid in my closet and refused to come out until she gave up, cursing me for my stubborn nature. I dismissed it as a vivid dream, a work of my overactive imagination. But I don’t think anyone could forget him. Could you blame me for remembering?

The second time I saw him, I was sixteen. A blank white day in January, a wintry landscape streaking past. I was a passenger in the car of a girl whose name has already escaped me. I was on the way to see this girl's parents, I think, even though we both knew I would be leaving soon. I remember catching her only out of the corner of my eye as my eyes roamed over the unfamiliar snowy forests outside. Then, for a mere split second, I saw him. Under the bridge, standing on the bank of the frozen river, face a smear paler than the snow - The River King, wrapped in furs, as young as the day I first stumbled upon his kingdom. The moment passed, we were over the bridge, and all that was left was the memory of his wide-eyed stare burned into my mind. I have forgotten most things about the girl, except for that she broke my heart, as most people have; but the river king’s upturned face under the pale sky will be with me forever. 

It has often occurred to me that I am under a curse. Why else would my own mother turn away from me in disgust? Why else would all of my friends leave me for some other, more whole person? Why else would all of them, every last one, inevitably disappoint me?  Why else would waking each day be torture? Perhaps this is the River King’s way of punishing me for intruding upon his kingdom; I was never meant to see him. He is a deep secret I have stumbled on out of sheer foolishness.

As I lie in my tangled bedsheets in the dim light of dawn, the bleakness of it all washes over me, the empty street below my window, the office I know will be quiet and slow and achingly miserable. The office that would continue lurching along, automaton style, if my car crashed and they found me with my brain matter splattered over the sidewalk. I turn over again and face the wall. 

Time doesn’t allow me to rest for long, and I find myself behind the wheel again. Every good thick lamppost I pass beckons me, but I'm used to this; I keep my eyes forward, trying not to think of the huge chasm of glass and filing cabinets waiting to swallow me whole. I flick on the radio to a gentle crooning song about love and the new beginnings of spring and it calms me. 

In my dim, long unrenovated cubicle, my coworkers stop by from time to time to babble some piece of unimportant gossip at me and seem not to understand my indifference. Sometimes I wonder what would happen if we were stranded here, cut off from civilization; how long would it take for them to start eating each other with their pearly white veneers? Would I be the first to go? The buzz of the lights hurts my ears and the flickering brightness hurts my eyes. I feel like standing and sweeping my whole life off of the desk, screaming, forcing them to look at me. I stay down. 

My fax machine begins to churn. It spits out a single sheet of paper, which flutters to the floor. I stoop for it, and the single sentence printed on it stares back at me.

AN IMPURE OFFERING BRINGS DISEASE

My hands are still and my eyes are glued to the fax. I attempt to rationalize it; it’s a prank; perhaps a mistake. But deep down, I know it’s them, and I  know they found me. Maybe they always knew where I was. And even though the message I hold in my hands could hardly be called threatening, a primal fear stirs in me.

My manager calls my name, snapping me back to reality. The hum of the workplace rushes in around my ears again as I stutter my apologies.

That evening, I sit up long into the night, drink in hand, lamplight low. I allow my mind to drift back to the River Kingdom. It seems to me now to be an arbour of hope and caring - perhaps I began to admire the way they looked after their king somewhere along the way, the way they loved to the point of self destruction. Perhaps I wish for someone to care for me that way. I envy that pale faced boy, and bitterly, then. I allow myself to wallow in the sensation. I know no one but myself would understand, the way no one else could have understood the strange reality I had the privilege of glimpsing that day. They had made me alone in this world. 

The next day, my sister calls. She tells me the same things she always does. Her dog is sick, her four-year-old is being difficult, she worries about me. I repeat the same reassurances into the phone until she gives up and leaves me alone. I don’t need her to worry about me - I would rather die than be pitied. The monotony of the day continues as usual. Another passive aggressive talking-to from the assistant manager; another round of numb small talk; another coffee mug shattered on the carpeted floor. I shut my eyes and wonder if this is all I will ever be. 

When I return home, a white envelope peeks out from under my doormat. I draw it out, neat and blank, and examine it for any trace of a return address, finding none. I tear open the side, expecting some nasty anonymous message from the neighbours about the placement of my drainpipe or the noise of my lawnmower. What I see instead is a crumpled note written in a shaky hand. 

THE RIVER KING IS DEAD AND WE HAVE KILLED HIM 

——————————————————

The soil squelches under my feet. I had forgotten the way fallen leaves smell in the spring. As I forge through the brush and branches, I take in the scent of the damp earth. Glancing behind me, I can see the chain link fence and grimy concrete walls of the public library on 24th and Elm grow smaller behind me. I know I’ll find them here, I just have to keep going. Nothing else matters.

The path takes me to a steep gully rimmed with trees. I see the water rippling under the leaves, only a hint of it, but growing stronger as far as the eye can see. I clamber down the slope and follow the faintly gurgling stream. My pace quickens as I turn bend after bend, the stream widening beside me until I come upon the rocky riverbank. I hurry downstream and I come upon them huddled together, oblivious to my presence. The white sky illuminates the stagnant, brush-choked river, and a crimson cloud curls downward from the water’s edge. The houses behind them lie empty; a pot on the fireplace is boiling over, and a dog barks wildly, but they seem to be either unaware or uncaring. I can hear wheezing cries of pain and a desperate struggle from inside their circle. I step forward, and all eyes land on me at once. This time, I do not run; I look them straight in the eyes, and it strikes me how beautiful they are, even with blood on their faces…

Strong hands lift me above the water. The bloodied, beaten body on the shore grows small in the corner of my eyes as a wave of the purest warmth and love comes over me. I squint at the twisted and deformed boy in the water, but I do not recognize his blank unseeing face, and it seems paltry and unimportant in the midst of my people’s cheering. I am safe; I am loved; I am forever. I am king.

1pkvafe,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pkvafe,From a chaotic yard full of boxes to my favorite reading spot. Added a pergola and a sunroom this year. Thoughts on the layout?,"Just wanted to share my backyard progress. It’s been quite a project!

I decided to install a pergola and a sunroom (greenhouse) to make the yard more usable. The photos show the chaos of the installation—so many parts!—but it was worth it.

The Pergola: I went with an all-aluminum structure because I didn't want to deal with rotting wood or repainting later.

The Roof Situation: You might notice in some pics the roof louvers (blades) are missing. Funny story: I installed this back in summer and actually stopped installing the blades on purpose because I wanted to soak up as much sun as possible while reading. Now that winter is coming, I’m finally finishing the install to close it up.

Sturdiness: I was a bit worried about our local weather, so I opted for a model with thicker columns. It feels rock solid. It’s supposed to handle heavy snow (20 inches or so) and high winds, which gives me peace of mind.

Best Feature: Honestly? The integrated outlets on the post. They are fully waterproof, and it’s been a game-changer for plugging in my laptop or coffee warmer without running extension cords across the lawn.

I also added a sunroom nearby for my plants. Still tweaking the landscaping around the edges. Would love to hear your thoughts or suggestions on what to plant around the base to soften the look!",3,1765554679.0,landscaping,0,0.8,False
1pkva9v,https://www.reddit.com/r/ToysRus/comments/1pkva9v/containing_chaos_in_portable_fencing/,Containing chaos in portable fencing,"My daughter turned into a mobile human the day she learned to crawl. Suddenly nowhere was safe. Electrical outlets called to her like sirens. Stairs became irresistible challenges. The cat's food bowl transformed into a fascinating sensory experience that ended with kibble scattered everywhere and a very annoyed cat.
I tried following her constantly, redirecting every dangerous impulse, baby proofing every surface. It was exhausting and impossible. I could not watch her every second. I had to use the bathroom. I had to cook food. I had work calls I could not postpone.
The baby playpen felt like giving up at first. Like admitting I could not handle parenting without containment devices. Other mothers seemed to manage without essentially caging their children. But those other mothers either had help I did not have or were lying about how they actually managed.
The playpen bought me sanity. I could set her inside with toys, knowing she was safe while I showered or prepared meals or had fifteen minutes to just sit and drink coffee while it was still hot. She could play, explore her toys, move around within boundaries. I could breathe without constant anxiety.
It is not perfect. She protests sometimes. I feel guilty seeing her reach through the mesh sides. But parenting requires making imperfect choices between competing needs.

1pkv9kj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1pkv9kj/i_got_fired_from_work_but_my_mom_says_it_wasnt/,I got fired from work but my mom says it wasn’t her fault,"I work as a nanny through a company and have set hours 7-7 every weekday and sometimes weekends. The kid is a 9 month old that I primarily take care of but there’s also a 3 year old that hangs around with mom upstairs while she works (he watches TV) my job is to entertain, feed, and nap the 9 month old. Since both parents are home they’ll sometimes put him down, tell me I can come later, leave early, etc. based on how their work day is going but when they are on calls they absolutely can’t adjust anything. I’ve been with this family for three months so not that long but we know how it works pretty well. The company I work for will pay me the full hours I work even if I don’t work it so it’s pretty nice. The family gets it discounted through their work.

I live at home with my parents and my brother who’s 2 years younger than I am. I‘m supposed to be at college right now but my boyfriend (now husband) decided to go to the army and didn’t want to keep up the rent on the place we had and I couldn’t do it myself and he didn’t want me doing college on campus all by myself so we kind of just threw everything into a storage place and he went to his parent’s house and I went to mine while he got prepped for Basic. He’s 22 and I’m 21 so we’re both legal adults though I don’t really do much of the “adult” stuff besides going to work. I don’t have a car because college was very easy to navigate by bus but when I left I had a car that I left at home and it essentially just went to my brother and is his car now. My parents had found it for me and made me pay 1k to “buy” it from them and I had to get like 3k of repairs done on it but they pay insurance on it so it’s still technically their car. They also have two cars for each of them, a big car for snow and traveling around and a Lexus that’s my mom’s for small errands and if we go short distances. 

The thing with my mom is that she’s a very selfish individual and I do know this and I have been told this. The way that we were raised though, (that I’ve been told) is that mom is always right and dad always listens to mom and not to argue about it. So I never argued and I never really questioned her until I got to the point where they wouldn’t pay for college out of state because they didn’t like my boyfriend and insisted I stayed with them. I don’t know where the rest of my college fund went but I’m making money now and saving enough to make it happen myself so I see it as a wash.

My dad hasn’t had a job in 1 1/2 years because, well, he claims the job market is bad. Actually, my mom just says that. The only reason he isn’t getting a job even though he’s looking is because my mom is insisting that he gets a work from home job and that doesn’t really exist full time because he’s in IT. So they’re kind of broke by their own means. They of course have enough for the house and bills but they really cut down on the groceries and such. They just kind of hang out and watch TV when my dad isn’t looking for jobs. My mom also bought a lot of new furniture to furnish our guest room and has been sleeping there for a while separate from my dad because “he snores too loud.” 

So I’m paying them $100 a month to cover the “car‘s wear and tear, gas, groceries, and privilege to live at the house.” That’s not a lot at all and I have no issue paying it but they don’t really call it rent (even though it essentially is rent). The issue is that they’re bumping me up to $200 because my mom never finished college and she wants me to finish college because it’s her biggest regret. Makes sense but I don’t have the facilities to do that ! That’s why I’m at home ! I will be able to continue in 6 months when my husband is out of basic and settled down wherever they place him because I’m an education major and I have to commit to a state to teach and get my degree in. If I finish college here I would have to leave halfway into the year and would have to learn new curriculum which would add on more semesters and it’s just a big mess, bigger than it already is. So I’m just sticking with this family for a bit because they pay me well, it’s pretty straightforward and easy, I’m saving a lot, and I just really like it, honestly. My parents don’t love my husband because he’s just loud and stubborn all the time. He does not like when he’s treated bad and my parents have said to his face that he doesn’t mean anything important to them. When we were figuring out military stuff he called me to work out logistics and tell my parents our plan but they absolutely refused to speak to him because they didn’t care about HIS plan. They only cared about MY plan. I used to be on my parent‘s phone plan but they kept taking my phone away at night and refused to get me a new phone when they could for free because I went to college out of state and they were upset about the fact that I was independent. My husband did not like that so I gave my dad my phone and got a new phone on husband’s plan with a new phone number. My mom is not a spiritual person and isn’t religious either, we weren’t raised like that. BUT all of a sudden when she saw my new number she absolutely refused to text or call it. I sent her a text when I got my phone four months ago and she hasn’t texted me ONCE since. Definitely haven’t called. The only time shes interacted with my phone has been in a group chat. She claims it’s because the number 4 means death and the 74 in my phone number means a long horrible death and she doesn’t want to put that into her life So she won’t call or text me. Stupid, in my opinion, because I want to send her videos and even though she doesn’t watch them in the first place, it’s nice to know that I can show them to her eventually since they’re in one place.

So the issue started on Tuesday, my dad took the Lexus to sleep over at grandma’s house because she doesn’t like sleeping alone in the house since grandpa died. He does this every Tuesday. I came home, my mom had a coupon for food so we got it since it was starting to snow and it was just the three of us so she wanted a treat. We ate and during dinner she asked me when I worked tomorrow, I told her they have a doctor appt in the morning so I’ll be going at 10:30 to get there at 9:00. Dinner was great, I had a crazy day so I fell asleep at 7:30 which was way earlier than normal, I hadn’t napped after work in two weeks so I was due to catch up on A LOT of sleep. I slept until 6:30 ish (my normal wake up time) and saw the mom had texted me asking to touch base at 11 since the snow came down bad and nothing was plowed. I told her I didn’t mind the drive whenever she needed me and went back to sleep. At 9:00 SHARP my mom banged on my door, opened it, and shook me awake. It felt violent but I was also asleep so I didn’t really know, my heart was beating really fast and I was disoriented, though. She began to tell me about how the snow was soft and I HAD to go shovel NOW. I don’t even own snow boots and the division of chores we’ve stuck to since 6th grade always was my brother shoveled or used the snow blower and I cleaned the mud room after he came in plus foyer and hardwood. I told her to get him to do it and she went off to bother him to do it I assume. I went back to sleep and in between heard her yelling about the snow but essentially was still half asleep so I didn’t really register anything. At 11 I woke up to my alarm and texted the mom, she said they had plowed and that I can be on my way as soon as I can, she had a meeting at the house they were moving to and couldn’t bring the kids because it wasn’t finished yet and was unsafe. 

I had a quick breakfast, gathered my stuff, fed the cat, and opened the door to the garage to see BOTH cars were gone. I knew my dad had taken the Lexus and was 10 minutes away but I assume my mom had taken the good car that could get through the drive to their house. I wasn’t surprised, though. I called her and she didn’t answer, of course bc of my phone number. I call her a bunch, text the group chat, ask where the car is because I have to go to work, etc. I think about taking my brother’s car but it’s not there, I don’t know what he does during the day but I assume he’s either at class or will be shortly. I check uber prices and it’s expensive because of how far it is. I call one of my friends and she’s in California of all places, I call my dad and he doesn’t answer but he does text and say “Talk to your mom” BUT I CAN’T REALLY DO THAT ! Finally after half an hour of stress and telling the family that I’ll be running late my mom sends a text “My car. You and (brother) stressed me out making me nag you to shovel snow. I need time away. Went to get coffee. Borrow (brother’s) car. Figure it out.” 

So not only am I SOL I’m mad and I really need to get to work ASAP. I call the company and tell them the situation-ish. Said that I have car issues and I can’t really get to the family but I’m letting them know as a head’s up since we have to report these issues to them. She says it’s okay and that they’ll send someone else for the rest of this week to the family so I can get the car stuff sorted out. I tell the family they're sending someone else temporarily which they’re not happy about but I’m relieved. I go upstairs get undressed, cuddle the cat and relax now that I don’t have to worry. 

That was Wednesday and now it’s Friday ! I got a call early this morning (two hours ago) from my boss, Stephanie, she’s a very nice woman. Anyway, she said that when I first got hired on they talked to my past employer (daycare) and they said that I was slightly unreliable because of time since I didn’t have a car and took the bus. She said that I didn’t have a terrible issue but when I clock in and out it‘s sometimes off by a few minutes, sometimes half hours or more. I told her it’s because the family doesn’t need me at that time but she wasn’t hearing it. She said that the temp they put in is doing really well with the family so far so they’re going to put her in to replace me and let me go next week. They have a short one week temp job for me to do next week (4 hours a day) then after that they don’t have anything else for me to do and I need to seek out a new job. 

Obviously, I’m mad as hell because I LOVE this job and not only does the family like me, I’m GOOD at it. Not in a bragging way, but I’m not good at many things…I am VERY good with kids like this.

My parents had been gone until late yesterday night (they went to MGM to play some poker and slots plus got a hotel room because my mom was so mad at us) so when I got that call I located her and told her she made me lose my job. I was never truly “late” to a job, I have been requested by other families, they all love me, I get positive reviews, and I follow all the rules. If she didn‘t take the car to go and get COFFEE because she was “stressed out” I would have been able to go to work and have a job. Now I have to look for a new one and it probably won’t pay the same or be as easy. She then said it was my fault for not shoveling because if I had done so then she wouldn’t be stressed about me taking the car and getting stuck in the driveway’s thick snow so she actually did ME a favor by taking the car so I wouldn’t get stuck. Makes no sense. She then told me that if anything it’s my husband’s fault for sending me back home because if he wasn’t such a deadbeat (she doesn’t really know what that word means) then I would be in an apartment with him in Chicago free to go whenever I want. He’s living with his parents as well and he doesn’t pay rent at all so it’s significantly cheaper for both of us, we both can afford to split an apartment but WHY WOULD WE. She went on to say some stuff about how only losers join the military and that he’s the biggest loser of them all, he works as a manager at a fast food place so he has nothing going on for him, he’s a bum, etc. just spouting a bunch of crap at me but essentially she’s saying it wasn’t her fault when I truly think it IS her fault. 

My dad won’t comment on it at all, my husband says that I need to hold on for a while and then I don‘t have to take it anymore. I don’t really know what’s up and now I’m just very upset.",2,1765554620.0,Advice,4,0.67,False

I have watched his videos, bought equipment based on his opinions, subscribed to Square Mile, and as a result I now make much better coffee. While I was working in London, where I am a designer in tech, one of my colleagues mentioned his café Prufrock. I was incredibly excited and we decided to have our 1:1 there.

The coffee was amazing, exactly what I expected. The service design, however, felt a bit strange. Instead of being greeted by a till, the first thing you see is an iPad. I was unsure whether I was supposed to place the order myself, and then someone ended up taking the order anyway. After that I waited and a waiter brought my coffee to me even though it was takeaway, which felt like an unnecessary use of staff. The whole setup seemed very intentional and maybe I need to visit again, but for someone who cares so much about the design and experience of coffee machines, it felt a little odd…..But what do I know I don’t own a cafe or coffee brand.

1pkv3to,https://tipstor.com/setenil-de-las-bodegas-in-spain/,Setenil de las Bodegas in Spain,"Setenil de las Bodegas looks like a town that refused to follow the rules of architecture and instead let a colossal slab of earth decide where the ceilings should go. Streets run beneath a rock overhang so immense it seems to press the sky downward, turning everyday life into a balancing act between geology and human stubbornness. Houses tuck themselves under the stone as if nature granted them rent-free shelter, their whitewashed walls glowing under the shadows that never quite fade. It is a place that feels like a secret, carved by wind, time, and the kind of ingenuity that makes travelers stop mid-step in awe.

The best season to witness this geological wonder is spring, when Andalusia warms without scorching and jasmine drifts through the narrow lanes. It is also when the action-adventure spirit of Setenil comes alive. Hikers follow cliffside routes that roll into neighboring pueblos, catching views of the river valley and olive groves that stretch toward the horizon like a vast Mediterranean tapestry. Cyclists navigate switchbacks that seem custom-made for adrenaline chasers. Even a simple wander through the rock-lined streets becomes an exploration into how far imagination can bend stone.

Food emerges as Setenil’s anchor, grounding visitors in flavors as bold as the landscape. Tapas bars carved into the rock serve slow-simmered chorizo, garlic-drenched mushrooms, and local goat cheese that melts into a decadent whisper. Grilled meats arrive sizzling, pairing beautifully with crisp Andalusian wines and cold beer poured into glasses beaded with condensation. Each dish seems designed to match the setting. Rustic, comforting, and unapologetically full of character. Coffee is strong, pastries are flaky, and long lunches spill into golden afternoons beneath the stone roof of Calle Cuevas del Sol.

Saving money in this storybook town is almost effortless. Family-run guesthouses tucked under the rock offer stays that are surprisingly affordable, especially when compared to nearby hotspots. Local bars serve generous tapas for just a few euros, often enough to build a full meal without ever opening a menu. Exploring the town costs nothing, and the most memorable sights are found simply by walking until the rock curves into new shapes overhead. Buses from Ronda connect travelers without draining a budget, transforming transportation into a scenic ride through rolling hills and whitewashed villages.

Setenil de las Bodegas stands as a place where the earth and its people share a single heartbeat. The rock above might inspire awe, but it is the life beneath that makes the town unforgettable. It is a reminder that travel’s greatest stories are often found in the shadows—where stone ceilings, good food, and a restless sense of adventure come together in perfect harmony.

Taste: sour on all pulls/ but texture seems fine Roast date: 12/5/25 
Roaster: Pablo’s Coffee (Denver) 
Roast level: med/dark (Little Gem) 
Bean details: sorry not sure on this. Def not single origin- it’s a blend. 
Dose: 17.5g 
Yield: 36g 
Time: 30sec 
Temp: 95c 

Workflow: DF 54 grinder set to very fine(7) on this pull. Espresso Machine is Turin Legato V2. Used spring load tamper. No real pre infusion on my machine so not utilizing that. 

I fear I cannot go any finer as this 7 is crazy to me on my grinder, and decreasing the dose more is ??? Maybe I’m totally wrong…

Today I'm 60. I had my LBK amputation in 2020 after a series of left foot partial amputations due to chronic infected diabetic  foot ulcers. Since 2020 my quality of life has increased and I'm much happier than I was the decade prior to 2020. That said, today is a milestone for me.

 I'm the victim of my own excess. I neglected my body for so long and it's all catching up to me now. I'm a type 2 diabetic but insulin dependent, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart attack survivor, have stent (will travel! Lol). Also diagnosed with Chronic Kidney disease. In the past few years I've made major changes to my diet and lifestyle. Cut back on processed foods, fast foods. Try to eat clean w homemade meals 95% of the time. Now, after an appt w my nephrologist, I was advised I must cut back on foods that are high in potassium and phosphorus. Healthy foods like brown rice, tomatoes, beans, brussel sprouts, spinach, raisin bran are now restricted, along with other foods I've been eating/drinking. Pork, coffee, ground beef most dairy, flour and corn tortillas, whole wheat bread all restricted as well. Not since 2019 have my dietary restrictions affected me so much. 

For the past month since my dietary changes I've been on a farewell tour, enjoying those foods. Last week I made a batch of pork Chile verde over brown rice w a stack of corn tortillas but after eating 2 portions I did some research and learned the main ingredient of the chile (tomatillos) are high in potassium.

But today, on my 60th, I am actively making the change. Today I'm enjoying my last cup of coffee, my last ration of bacon. 

My only child, my daughter, recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl and I want to be around to watch her grow up. I make this change for my health and for her.

Apparently, according to Reddit, you shouldn’t approach women at all. Not at the bar. Not at a gym. Not at a coffee shop. Not even to say ""hey, cool jacket"" because that’s somehow a federal offense now 🤣

Like bro, how do people think humans met before dating apps? Smoke signals? Carrier pigeons? A notarized consent form before saying hello?

I get it don’t be creepy, don’t corner someone, don’t be weird. That’s obvious. But a normal, respectful compliment followed by reading the room shouldn’t be treated like a crime scene investigation.

Real life isn’t Reddit. Most normal people can tell the difference between a chill compliment and a guy being a creep. If she’s not interested, you say ""all good"" and move on with your day. No meltdown, no manifesto.

Sometimes it feels like Reddit advice is just written by people who never leave the house but are VERY confident about how social interactions should work.

It’s always the same nonsense: the person says they “assumed the internal state of a millionaire, that they imagined themselves receiving abundant amounts of money for months,” and when you check their actual results, it’s like… 500 dollars.
Don’t get me wrong, that’s not a bad amount of money, but it’s nowhere near “abundant” or a truly significant quantity.

And when someone shows up claiming they manifested a lot -> like millions of dollars — almost always the person already had everything set up: a business, a company, investments, a whole structure.
Then it’s easy to say they “manifested” it.

And then comes the best part:
People saying they “built the internal state of a billionaire.”
That whole speech of “I feel like a billionaire, I think like a billionaire, I live like someone who attracts unlimited infinite money, and you should do the same to become rich.”

But then you check the real result:
The person earned, in total, a thousand dollars — if that.
A thousand.
That doesn’t even pay for the doormat in the imaginary billionaire’s house they claim to have become “internally.”
The disconnect between the imagined money and the received money is so massive it’s honestly laughable.

Another thing: most of the so-called “surprising” stories are painfully weak:

“I got a refund.” Great, congrats, the bank gave you back your own money.
“I sold a property I already owned.” That’s just you liquidating assets, not manifesting anything.

And then the gems: “my uncle gave me money for coffee.”
I’m sorry, but that’s not manifestation -> that’s family charity.
There’s absolutely nothing extraordinary about it.

Dude… this shouldn’t even be posted.
It’s the kind of thing you keep to yourself so you don’t embarrass yourself online.
It’s so tragicomic, so small, so sad, so completely devoid of glory…
that if it were me, I would delete my account, erase the post, move to another country, and pretend I never said that in my life.

It’s pure performative delusion.
Seriously, some people seem to live in a parallel universe where 400 dollars is a universal miracle and 1,000 dollars is “proof of unlimited wealth.”

And the worst part:
They genuinely believe this proves something.
They walk around as if they just bought half of Manhattan, when in reality they couldn’t even afford the rent of Manhattan’s bathroom.

The question I ask is simple and devastating:

How can someone look at 200, 500, 1,000 dollars and think that validates an “internal state of a billionaire”?
It’s like watching a child say they’re a Formula 1 driver because they got a toy car.

This behavior isn’t just ridiculous ->
it’s humiliating by itself.

And to be honest… speaking from my real life… I’ve never manifested real money.
I’m just starting in this whole law thing, trying to understand, trying to absorb it, trying to see if anything makes sense.
But honestly? The more I see these ridiculous stories of people manifesting loose change and calling it fortune, the more I keep thinking: what the hell is going on?

1pkur4d,https://www.reddit.com/r/OnlineMBA/comments/1pkur4d/i_got_the_mba_waitlist_email_help/,I got the MBA waitlist email — help,"Dear Reader,

Take a breath! If you just opened an email from an MBA program and felt your stomach drop, pause. Because whether you landed on the waitlist or were rejected outright, here’s the truth: This moment does not define your potential—it just redirects your strategy.

**STOP 1: Pivot, don’t panic**

A waitlist (or rejection) tells you one thing. For this round, in this pool, your application didn’t rise to the top — not that YOU can’t. Before you even think about engaging with admissions, applying to other schools in Round 2, or reapplying next year, ask yourself:

* Did I clearly articulate why MBA, why this school, and why now?
* Did my story feel cohesive and authentic, or did my goals sound like “Pinterest career inspiration”?
* Did my recommenders actually showcase my impact?
* Were my test scores or quant prep below the class median?

This isn’t self-blame. This is diagnostics—and diagnostics are empowering.

**STOP 2: A waitlist isn’t a soft no—it’s a slow yes** 

Being waitlisted means the school saw potential—enough to keep you in play. Your job now is to stay visible without being overwhelming. What to do:

* Send a crisp, confident update letter (not a memoir) sharing new achievements or clarity on goals.
* Attend events, virtual sessions, or coffee chats and reference those experiences when possible in your update.
* Strengthen any soft spots (quant coursework, test score bump, leadership wins).

Waitlist movement can happen late—sometimes all the way into the summer. In other words: stay ready.

**BONUS Stop**

If the dreaded rejection email does come, here’s your playbook: 

* Apply to other schools in R2. Stay away from recycling materials—focus on a refresh.
* Talk to reapplicants—the unsung heroes of MBA admissions. They’ve seen both sides of the process, and they’re often the most candid, generous people you’ll meet. Here’s how to find them (and get real insights fast): 
   * Ask ambassadors, club leaders, or peer mentors directly: “Do you know anyone who was a reapplicant?”
   * Reddit: [r/MBA](/r/MBA/) and [r/gradadmissions](/r/gradadmissions/) are full of people sharing their reapp stories.
   * MBA friends-of-friends: Your network will be surprised how many they know once you ask.

This moment will feel heavy, but rejections and waitlists often catalyze the strongest versions of MBA applications. Many admits will tell you their journey only made sense in hindsight, and you’re building resilience, clarity, and confidence that will serve you way beyond this moment. 

Let us know if you have any follow-ups. Readers – feel free to share your thoughts below or DM us with next week’s question!

Yours truly,

Besides of course liking the coffee beans from a certain roaster.

What are some other things that make you decide to buy at that certain roastery? Shipping/packaging/price/sustainability.

Would love to hear your opinion as I'm currently helping a friend with his website that has an overview of specialty coffee roasters worldwide. Right now it's giving the name, website and whether it has a subscription option or not.

Personally one of the things I do actually care a bit more about than I thought is the packaging. It's just nice to have a nice looking bag of coffee. That's why I like buying at Rush Rush and/or Friedhats.

It’s been 4 months since the break up and I still think about her every day. The break up kind of ruined my life. I understand that sounds dramatic, but I still cry nearly every day. I’m so depressed and isolate from my friends (except one). I don’t want to do that but I hate being around people when I feel I have no energy. I feel like I’m brining down the mood. It’s like I cannot mentally or physically bring myself to be around them. I can’t do anything I used to enjoy. I can’t go to a lot of restaurants or coffee shops or the movie theater or certain artsy stores we used to go to because it’s triggering. I get flooded with memories. I can’t listen to any of the music I used to listen to anymore because all the lyrics remind me of her. So I have to listen to the most basic songs by artists I don’t even enjoy that much that are just “vIbEz.” I can’t watch any of the shows I used to watch because they’re either shows she got me into or shows we used to watch together. I just feel like an overall shell of myself. It’s never been like this with any other woman. I can’t get over what happened. That the time we shared together was a lie, and never meant as much to her nearly as did it to me. The dishonesty. The games, manipulating my emotions to feed her ego. She messaged me a little while after the break up saying she wanted me back but I ignored it because not only is it painful to talk to her after learning about her, I just don’t believe anything she tells me. You cannot be with someone if you have 0 trust in them. But my feelings are all messed up because other than her toxic behaviors, which is obviously an important factor, she was perfect in every other way. She was smart, had a good sense of humor, I was physically attracted to her, she had a job and a car, and was creative which was a bonus. But she destroyed my perception of women and dating. Despite getting treated bad in the past before I met her, like getting cheated on or abused, I was still a hopeless romantic and remained optimistic. But this breakup changed something in me. I just don’t view women the same anymore. I try to trust but it’s so hard now. It sounds dumb but I truly thought she was different. She initially showed a lot of mature characteristics and was willing to talk about a lot of crucial topics in relationships my exes never wanted to discuss, I was so happy to be with someone like her (until I figured out the way she actually moves). I realized it might not be possible for me to find anyone I liked as much as her so I even lowered my standards. But I barely find anyone attractive. I genuinely don’t know if I could ever feel for someone like I did her. She probably forgot about me by now which makes me feel even more ridiculous. I just hate how she’s always on my mind. It’s like I’m a prisoner. I use a lot of coping skills that worked for me in the past but like I said, something about this experience is different for me. Maybe because she was toxic but in a more subtle way, or to a lesser degree. I have no idea but I want to be over it but I don’t know how.",1,1765553080.0,actuallesbians,0,1.0,False

1pkul9z,https://www.reddit.com/r/MBA/comments/1pkul9z/i_got_the_mba_waitlist_email_help/,I got the MBA waitlist email — help,"Dear Reader,

Take a breath! If you just opened an email from an MBA program and felt your stomach drop, pause. Because whether you landed on the waitlist or were rejected outright, here’s the truth: This moment does not define your potential—it just redirects your strategy.

**STOP 1: Pivot, don’t panic**

A waitlist (or rejection) tells you one thing. For this round, in this pool, your application didn’t rise to the top — not that YOU can’t. Before you even think about engaging with admissions, applying to other schools in Round 2, or reapplying next year, ask yourself:

* Did I clearly articulate why MBA, why this school, and why now?
* Did my story feel cohesive and authentic, or did my goals sound like “Pinterest career inspiration”?
* Did my recommenders actually showcase my impact?
* Were my test scores or quant prep below the class median?

This isn’t self-blame. This is diagnostics—and diagnostics are empowering.

**STOP 2: A waitlist isn’t a soft no—it’s a slow yes** 

Being waitlisted means the school saw potential—enough to keep you in play. Your job now is to stay visible without being overwhelming. What to do:

* Send a crisp, confident update letter (not a memoir) sharing new achievements or clarity on goals.
* Attend events, virtual sessions, or coffee chats and reference those experiences when possible in your update.
* Strengthen any soft spots (quant coursework, test score bump, leadership wins).

Waitlist movement can happen late—sometimes all the way into the summer. In other words: stay ready.

**BONUS Stop**

If the dreaded rejection email does come, here’s your playbook: 

* Apply to other schools in R2. Stay away from recycling materials—focus on a refresh.
* Talk to reapplicants—the unsung heroes of MBA admissions. They’ve seen both sides of the process, and they’re often the most candid, generous people you’ll meet. Here’s how to find them (and get real insights fast): 
   * Ask ambassadors, club leaders, or peer mentors directly: “Do you know anyone who was a reapplicant?”
   * Reddit: [r/MBA](/r/MBA/) and [r/gradadmissions](/r/gradadmissions/) are full of people sharing their reapp stories.
   * MBA friends-of-friends: Your network will be surprised how many they know once you ask.

This moment will feel heavy, but rejections and waitlists often catalyze the strongest versions of MBA applications. Many admits will tell you their journey only made sense in hindsight, and you’re building resilience, clarity, and confidence that will serve you way beyond this moment. 

Let us know if you have any follow-ups. Readers – feel free to share your thoughts below or DM us with next week’s question!

Yours truly,

The Power Move

I did end up reaching out to my ex a couple of days ago just basically said I know she’s going through it but I’m here if she wants me to be. She was sweet and said she hoped my Christmas holiday plans go well, but she’s still feeling like shit. I wasn’t expecting her to take the offer, it was more just trying to get the message through at a less “I’m in immediate crisis” moment.

We haven’t spoken since, I’m still worried about her but I know she’s alive because she checks all my stories like clockwork.

Depression is a beast and she said during the breakup that she thought she might be self sabotaging and isolating, but life’s just too intense for her and she couldn’t see a way out from the hole and didn’t want to hurt me or have me hurt her when I (eventually) realised she wasn’t perfect. Obviously in that moment nothing I could say could get through, and I’ve made some peace with the fact I have to leave her alone for the holidays so she can be with her family and hopefully regulate a little bit, and probably for a bit afterwards so she can find therapy and some new meds or something.

1pkuibc,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1pkuibc/im_not_sure_if_she_is_interested_in_me_or_just/,I'm not sure if she is interested in me or just needing a distraction.,"We matched on Hinge a couple of weeks ago, but her profile said to add her on Instagram because she never checks Hinge. Normally I avoid that because it feels like someone just wants followers, but I went for it anyway. Her IG page seemed normal and not influencer-ish, which was a good sign.

We talked for about a week, though she was inconsistent. Then on Sunday she asked me to get coffee.

When we met, we seemed to hit it off, but she came across as very awkward. One of the first things she said was, “I’m only here because you’re funny,” which I thought was odd. She also mentioned she’d just put her cat down, so I understood why she might not have been very responsive.

We ended up hanging out for four hours, walked around town, and I walked her to her apartment lobby. She also mentioned I was only the second date she’d been on all year.

After that, texting stayed pretty minimal and I felt like she wasn’t that interested, but I asked her out again anyway. She responded and even suggested a day and place.

We met up last night and spent six hours together. To be honest, I think she partly wanted to go to the place she suggested because there was a chess tournament and she loves chess. She only played one game and watched a bit, but she spent most of the time talking with me.

During the night she told me she’d been in a bad fender-bender that morning. I was surprised she still showed up, but she said she needed a night to laugh and decompress. This made me start to feel like maybe I was more of a distraction from everything going on in her life, not someone she saw real dating potential with.

At the end of the night, I asked her directly whether she felt a connection, a friendship, or if I was just a distraction. She didn’t really answer the question. Instead, she said she felt cautious because I seemed “too nice or perfect.” I’ve heard that on dates before. I’m definitely not perfect, but I tried to reassure her that I’m a genuine person. I'm a divorced guy with a son in my mid-30s. I am also quiet and emotionally withdrawn when I feel stressed. She gave me a hug and a kiss on the cheek goodnight, but I still didn't end the night feeling much interest coming from her.

I haven’t heard anything from her today. She only responds if I reach out first.

I know it was only two dates, but we spent a lot of time together on both and had meaningful conversations. I don’t need constant texting, but I do want someone who shows interest outside of the actual dates.

Right now, I’m leaning towards waiting a day and then sending a message saying I had a good time but don’t think we’re compatible and wishing her the best. She didn’t do anything wrong, I just don’t think we’re on the same page, and I don’t want to risk developing deeper feelings if I’m only serving as a temporary distraction for her.

Thoughts? Am I just being too fast or thinking about this reasonably? I'm at a point in my life I don't want ambiguity or trying to guess. I'm open to a kick in the butt from my dear redditors or validation.

1pkug3y,https://www.reddit.com/r/family/comments/1pkug3y/taking_over_family_business_3_months_after_birth/,Taking over family business 3 months after birth?!,"         Hi! I’ll try to be concise with a multi faceted problem…
Firstly… not my birth!😂😂😂😂😂 
My (42m) dad (78m) has run a “business” that is basically a community center, open 8am-8/12pm depending on the day, everyday. There is coffee and snacks, but also LOTS of events every week from dancing to classes to gaming etc. lots of kids and families around all the time. There is a playground. My dad has been doing it for 40+ years and the money is…. Keeping it afloat… but it’s mostly about the community. Everyone who works there is staying on so that’s helpful but It can be emotionally taxing with a lot of people wanting a lot from you. We had talked for many years about me taking over things which I had always been eager about. 
My responsibilities would be to pay everyone, to be there most days but not all day or everyday, to manage schedules, make repairs on the building (a constant job) cook occasionally, to manage events and daily happenings, deal with the paper work payment for the food, building, land, utilities etc. 
          
         Unfortunately for us, the political situation has changed and expedited things. My dad is a fully legal resident alien but is almost 80 and living in complete fear all the time of being deported, and now is voluntarily leaving the only country he’s known for 60 years because he doesn’t want to live like this. I know some people don’t think it’s that big of deal, but I assure those people don’t have any actual connection to this issue. It is a real threat, it is happening, CITIZENS are being deported, green cards are being revoked and people trying to just update their LEGAL papers are getting picked up at there appointments and shipped off without a word. It literally happened to someone my dad’s age and nationality. He was sent to a different 3rd country and no one knew where he was for months. 

But this isn’t about that… I only mention it to give context to the situation. 

Anyhow, my dad is leaving under not the best circumstances but I can hardly say… “just wait a year!”.  So it kind of needs to happen nowish. I’ve already agreed and it’s a done deal as far as everyone is concerned, I’m due to take over in March.

Here’s the thing, 
I’m having a baby around Christmas. I WANT to spend ALL of my energy taking care of my new baby and wife, (I also have another business that I do well with so the money from my dads thing is sort of incidental) but also if I don’t take my dads place over there will be a LOT of disappointed people… including my whole family and myself, I’m not sure I could stand to watch someone else destroy it (or do well at it😂) the place has been my second home since childhood and it would be great if my kid could do that too but I just don’t know if I have it in me. I keep having panic attacks thinking about taking on the responsibility.
I’m almost opposed on a spiritual level to  having authority or power of any kind. 
I find it repulsive. I’ve seen what it does to people, willfully grasping the reins of power seems to only deepen and strengthen our delusion that we can control anything at all and I don’t necessarily want to open myself up to that level of suffering and ignorance. 

From the outside, everyone thinks I’ll do great and says I’m a shoe in and am perfectly suited to take over. 

I have a brother and sister both of whom are perfectly capable and seem to have the time and energy (ie no babies or business’s or grown babies and business’s ) but have made it VERY clear from the beginning they don’t have any interest in doing it, even tho they spend a bunch of time there, arguably more than me. 

Soooooo….. I don’t know what to do. Pressure my sibs? Just let it go? Convince my dad to wait until the mid terms (I tried that already)? Suck it up because it won’t be that hard? Am I better off just suffer through the early months and making it happen? Am I misremembering how much energy a new born is for a dad?!  

I know it’s silly to ask thousands of strangers on the internet what to do about a very personal and nuanced thing but I figured someone out there may have some insight and at the very least I’ll have  screamed my issues into the void where it can mingle with a trillion others.

I've gone on probably 10 first dates (from matches).  I will usually put a fair amount of effort into these dates, usually it'll be a happy hour type situation at a wine bar or reasonably cool cocktail situation (sometimes transitioning to a speakeasy type establishment)...occasionally it'll just be coffee if the woman's expressed that she isn't into drinking.  Never high end restaurants on a first date (2nd date yes, potentially depending on the vibe). Most were good experiences.  I'm just curious, what level of planning/date are you expecting on a first date?  I'm not worried about money etc., I just don't want to overdo (or underwhelm) right out of the gate.

I can typically eat basically whatever I want, drink coffee every day, etc... for long stretches of time. The first time I had a really bad GERD flare was 2023 after I had Covid. I'd been coughing and taking a bunch of NSAIDs for fever and headache and one day the GERD pain just hit me - wrapping around my whole middle. I did Pepcid for two weeks and changed my diet and it totally died down and I was back to normal. I'd take like 5mg of pepcid now and then for some mild heartburn, but nothing crazy. 

Then, last month I pulled something in my back and took Aleve (naproxen) for a few days and BOOM - back to the horrible pain. I know, obviously, the NSAIDs triggered me both times. But, does anyone else have GERD like this, where you can just live normally for months or years and then make one big mistake and it comes on in full force?? 

I'm back to eating super mild and taking Pepcid, but I've not been as good lately because of Thanksgiving and a weekend trip, so it's really lingering this time. I'm hoping once I get back on track, I'll get back to my old normal. Any similar stories? ",1,1765552532.0,GERD,1,1.0,False

You got any change?” I replied “I don’t carry cash, I’m sorry,” he looked bummed. When I was in there I got a drink, a sandwich, a bag of chips, a candy bar, and 2 bananas. I walked back out and gave it all to him. He made a joke saying “what you got me bananas because I’m black.” I was about to be like are you serious!?? But he then laughed and was extremely appreciative.

Another encounter, I was at a 7-eleven. It was around 5 am. I saw someone under a blanket sleeping outside on the concrete in 40 degree Fahrenheit weather. I felt so awful that I went in the store and bought them some tea, some water, a winter hat, winter gloves, a muffin, and some other things. I tried to be really quiet as I dropped it off so I wouldn’t wake him/her but I made a noise and the man jumped out from under his blanket like I was trying to rob him. I get it, you have to be aware in those scenarios, but damn it scared both of us. After I explained I was greeted with a lot of appreciation.

So to the old man who bought me a coffee because I briefly made conversation with you while in line, you have fed 2 people,(many more actually, I just didn’t list them all) because of your random act of kindness.

1pkuckt,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForteFoundation/comments/1pkuckt/i_got_the_mba_waitlist_email_help/,I got the MBA waitlist email — help,"Dear Reader,

Take a breath! If you just opened an email from an MBA program and felt your stomach drop, pause. Because whether you landed on the waitlist or were rejected outright, here’s the truth: This moment does not define your potential—it just redirects your strategy.

**STOP 1: Pivot, don’t panic**

A waitlist (or rejection) tells you one thing. For this round, in this pool, your application didn’t rise to the top — not that YOU can’t. Before you even think about engaging with admissions, applying to other schools in Round 2, or reapplying next year, ask yourself:

* Did I clearly articulate why MBA, why this school, and why now?
* Did my story feel cohesive and authentic, or did my goals sound like “Pinterest career inspiration”?
* Did my recommenders actually showcase my impact?
* Were my test scores or quant prep below the class median?

This isn’t self-blame. This is diagnostics—and diagnostics are empowering.

**STOP 2: A waitlist isn’t a soft no—it’s a slow yes** 

Being waitlisted means the school saw potential—enough to keep you in play. Your job now is to stay visible without being overwhelming. What to do:

* Send a crisp, confident update letter (not a memoir) sharing new achievements or clarity on goals.
* Attend events, virtual sessions, or coffee chats and reference those experiences when possible in your update.
* Strengthen any soft spots (quant coursework, test score bump, leadership wins).

Waitlist movement can happen late—sometimes all the way into the summer. In other words: stay ready.

**BONUS Stop**

If the dreaded rejection email does come, here’s your playbook: 

* Apply to other schools in R2. Stay away from recycling materials—focus on a refresh.
* Talk to reapplicants—the unsung heroes of MBA admissions. They’ve seen both sides of the process, and they’re often the most candid, generous people you’ll meet. Here’s how to find them (and get real insights fast): 
   * Ask ambassadors, club leaders, or peer mentors directly: “Do you know anyone who was a reapplicant?”
   * Reddit: r/MBA and r/gradadmissions are full of people sharing their reapp stories.
   * MBA friends-of-friends: Your network will be surprised how many they know once you ask.

This moment will feel heavy, but rejections and waitlists often catalyze the strongest versions of MBA applications. Many admits will tell you their journey only made sense in hindsight, and you’re building resilience, clarity, and confidence that will serve you way beyond this moment. 

Let us know if you have any follow-ups. Readers – feel free to share your thoughts below or DM us with next week’s question!

Although, it really never died. I chatted with u/OriginalPNWest a few weeks back about how to keep this report rolling and ... <Mario>LET'S-A GO!</Mario>

First off, I again want to thank u/OriginalPNWest **THE OG** for all the time and energy spent on these reports in the past. I don't think many understand how much effort u/OriginalPNWest put into the report summaries. Thanks for putting in all work over the years and good luck on your next adventure! <ALSO It is sort of sad to see you leave partially because our health system isn't top-tier. Crossing fingers that the Bend health system gets way better like ~~SOON~~...~~NOW~~...YESTERDAY>

OK, so what's next for the report? Well, that's where I plan to help. I'm no whippersnapper and not as cool as the OG, but being from the Oregon Trail Generation, I'm hoping none of us die of dysentery. Continuing the reports will definitely help with that, right? I've always loved the reports because they're an quick and easy summary of the recent happenings to places in the area. I intend on keeping the similar weekly cadence and style you already know while trying out some new/interesting ways to look at the data as I find time.

Some format changes I made:

* Put the data into a tabular format. I'm not sure if this is an improvement for viewing on your phone, but bear with me. I'll tweak it to try to make sure it gets better as I flail wildly adding columns like an idiot.
* Added a link to each establishment's page on the inspection website. Just tap/click on the link in the Name column. This is nice because you can quickly go to their page and see their history.
* Added a link to the inspection report in the ""Worst Scorers"" table. Just tap/click on the number in the Score column. This is the first thing I usually go look up myself, so why not make it easy? The ""Perfect 100s"" table doesn't have this column since there really isn't a report to read.

Anyway, let me know if you have ideas on what would be cool to see in summary form from all the inspection data. I'll add them to my `TODO` list.

OK, that’s all I have for this first post. Enjoy the weekend (if it is your weekend), and have a great next week! 🍻

# Perfect 100s

These are all the places that scored a perfect 100 in the latest inspection. That's a real achievement. A 100 score shows a commitment to keeping the establishment healthy and clean, which is what we all want.

I have been her caregiver for about six of those. Within those six years, her symptoms have progressed very slowly... until recently. I believe she's (somehow) aware of many of these changes and is reacting by falling into an extreme depression in which she sleeps the majority of the day, everyday. 

Lately, she been malaising in bed in the mornings when she used to wake up around 7 am everyday. She'd usually get up, get going, get her coffee started, and join me on the couch for the news. Now, I find her just laying there, eyes open, or partially asleep, without being willing to get up. It's quite saddening. She doesn't even want to get through another day in her own life. Is she that aware of the changes that are happening?! I don't know. 

She goes back to bed about 2-3 hours after forcing herself to get up. She says it's due to pain, but I believe it's a combination of pain, boredom, and depression. She sleeps between 1-3 hours before laying back down in the afternoon for more hours. And then she goes to bed between 6-7 pm every night. 

She says she wakes up throughout the night and doesn't sleep well. No kidding! How can anyone sleep that much unless they're really ill?! She tells me she just lays there when she wakes up, tosses and turns, before she eventually dozes off again.

She's not willing to change this behavior *at all*. I have suggested doing things throughout the day to occupy her time, but she's ""too tired"" or ""in too much pain"" or ""too sore"" or ""just don't feel like it!"" She gets defensive and can be nasty about the whole thing when I mention it. 

What do I do, if anything, to help her get through this? She takes anti-depressants and sees a psychiatrist regularly. Trust me when I tell you I can't imagine how much worse it would be without the meds. I can't stand watching her willingly fade away like this.

The problem: Git history contains everything about what your team shipped, but extracting useful information from it is painful. Commit messages are written for machines, not stakeholders. Status reports are a time sink. Changelogs go stale. And developers doing critical backend/infrastructure work often go unrecognized. What Gitmore does: AI-powered queries - Ask questions in plain English: ""What did the team ship last week?"" or ""Show me Sarah's contributions this month"" (powered by Claude) Automated reports - Weekly/monthly summaries delivered via email or Slack. AI converts cryptic commits into human-readable narratives Auto-generated changelogs - Public changelog page that updates itself from your Git activity Developer leaderboard - A ""Coffee Score"" system that recognizes all types of contributions, not just visible UI changes Slack integration - Query your repos directly from Slack What we DON'T do: We never access your source code. Only commit metadata (messages, timestamps, authors), PR info, and contributor profiles. Stack: Next.js 15, MongoDB, Claude API, works with GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket. Pricing: Free tier (1 repo), Pro at $15/mo (5 repos), Enterprise at $49/mo (20 repos). For a 10-person team, this saves roughly 78 hours/year that would otherwise go to manual status reporting.

1pku6cv,https://i.redd.it/ogv1gugigs6g1.jpeg,Amy’s Diary – Friday: The Day Before Mom’s Birthday,"Dear Diary,

Today was Friday, which already makes everything feel better. But today wasn’t just any Friday. It was The Day Before Mom’s Birthday, and the house was buzzing like a beehive… except the beehive was full of sisters, snacks, and one very enthusiastic belly (mine).


---

After School – The Final Countdown

When I got home, I barely had time to drop my bag before Linda called out,
“Okay, girls! Final planning meeting! Tomorrow is Mom’s birthday!”

I skidded into the living room in my socks and nearly tripped over the edge of the rug. My belly wobbled forward like it was trying to keep me upright.

“Careful,” said Shelley, catching my arm.
“Your center of gravity is… enthusiastic today.”

“Tell that to my stomach,” I replied.

Everyone gathered again:
Jennifer with her serious face.
Vicky with a mug of tea.
Melissa with her phone and a checklist app.
Heather carrying wrapping paper like a fashion accessory.
Gillian half-asleep but present.
Linda with her notebook (very official).
Nina with printed photos in a big envelope.
Shelley smiling, calm as always.

And me. Sitting cross-legged on the floor, belly proudly making a tent under my sweater.


---

The Big Plan (According to Linda)

Linda cleared her throat.

“Alright. Here’s the plan for tomorrow.”

She read from her notes:

1. Morning Surprise – Wake Mom up with breakfast and a group hug.


2. Memory Board Reveal – Show her the board with photos and notes.


3. Lunch Out – Take her to her favorite place.


4. Evening Cake & Song – Cake, singing, maybe crying.



“That’s… perfect,” I said softly.

My belly responded with a happy blorp.

Vicky raised an eyebrow. “Did it just approve the plan?”

“Yes,” I said seriously. “It says this plan is emotionally satisfying.”


---

The Memory Board Incident

Nina spread the photos out on the table. There were baby pictures, holiday photos, silly selfies, old Christmas mornings… even one where Mom had frosting on her nose.

“Aww,” I said. “She’s going to cry.”

“Which is why,” said Jennifer, “we need to assemble this carefully.”

Heather laid the big board flat on the coffee table.

This was my first mistake.

Because coffee table height is exactly… belly height.

I leaned forward to grab a photo of baby-me in a Santa hat, and—

FWUMP.

My belly gently pressed onto the edge of the board.

The board tipped.

Photos slid.

Glue sticks rolled.

“AMY—!” Nina shouted.

“I DIDN’T MEAN TO—!”

The board tipped fully, sliding off the table and landing on the couch instead. Luckily, nothing broke.

Everyone froze.

Then Gillian yawned and said,
“Well. That could have been worse.”

Jennifer exhaled slowly. “Okay. New rule. Amy stays at least one belly-length away from all important objects.”

I raised my hand. “How long is one belly-length?”

“Too long,” said Melissa.

Shelley smiled and pulled the board further away.
“You can help by writing notes instead, Ame.”

“Probably safer,” I admitted.


---

Writing the Notes (And the Wiggle)

We each sat with small cards to write our messages for Mom.

I sat on the floor with my back against the couch, legs stretched out. My belly made a nice little shelf for my notebook.

I wrote:

> Dear Mom,
Thank you for hugging us even when we’re noisy, messy, and sometimes wrapped in Christmas lights.
Thank you for laughing with me, even when my belly causes trouble.
I love you more than cookies. And that’s a lot.
Love, Amy.



As I leaned forward to finish the heart at the bottom, my belly shifted and the notebook slid right off.

Plop.

It landed upside down.

Heather laughed. “Your belly rejected the heart shape.”

“I’m redoing it!” I said.

The second try worked, but only because Shelley gently held my notebook steady.


---

Practice Singing (Belly Percussion Included)

After the notes were done, Melissa said,
“Okay, we should practice the birthday song so we don’t sound like dying geese tomorrow.”

We stood in a loose semicircle in the living room.

“One, two, three—”

We started singing.

Halfway through, my belly growled loudly.

GRRRRRRRRRP.

Everyone stopped.

Jennifer stared at me.
“…Was that you or are we adding percussion?”

“Sorry,” I said. “It’s hungry.”

Heather clapped her hands. “Wait, wait. Try again. But this time, let’s see if the belly keeps rhythm.”

“No,” I said.

“Yes,” everyone else said.

We tried again.

And again, right on the long note, my belly went:
grrrp—blorp.

Nina doubled over laughing.
“It’s perfectly timed!”

Gillian blinked. “I like this version better.”

Shelley put her arm around me.
“Don’t worry. Mom will think it’s adorable.”

“I hope so,” I said. “Because this thing does not know how to be quiet.”


---

The Cake Test (Very Important)

Linda brought out the cake box from the fridge.
“Tomorrow morning we’ll decorate it. But let’s just check it now.”

She opened the box.

Chocolate. With cream. And strawberries.

My belly reacted immediately.

RRRRRRRRRRRRRRR.

It was so loud, even Jennifer laughed.

“Okay,” said Linda. “We know who’s excited.”

“I’m not touching it,” I said, holding my hands up. “I swear.”

“I’m watching you,” said Vicky.

Shelley gently closed the box again.
“Tomorrow,” she said softly. “Patience.”

My belly gave a disappointed little plorp.


---

Evening – The Quiet Moment

Later, when most of the planning was done and my sisters drifted away one by one, I stayed in the living room helping Linda clean up.

Mom walked in, surprised to see things slightly tidier than usual.

“You girls are being awfully busy lately,” she said suspiciously.

I froze.

“Busy is… good?” I offered.

She smiled and came over, sitting beside me on the couch. When she sat, my belly gently bumped her arm.

She laughed.
“Still full of energy, huh?”

“Always,” I said.

She leaned her head on mine for a moment.
“I’m really lucky, you know.”

My chest felt tight, in a good way.

If she only knew what was waiting for her tomorrow…


---

Right now, I’m in bed, writing this while my belly sticks up like a little hill under my pajamas. Tomorrow is Mom’s birthday. Everything is planned. Almost everything is ready.

All that’s left is for my belly to behave.

…Which means it probably won’t.

But even if something goes wrong, I think Mom will laugh.
She always does.

And that’s what makes her the best mom in the world.

Amy 🎂💙✨",1,1765551986.0,u_FunRestaurant3384,0,1.0,False

I’m Michael. For years I’ve worked from cafés all over the world. I love great coffee, good vibes, and the quiet energy of being around people while getting things done.

But here’s the thing I kept noticing.

Cafés are full of interesting people… and most of us sit there alone.

Developers, designers, founders, writers, travelers. We’re all sharing the same space, yet everyone stays in their own bubble. I can’t count how many times I wondered who was sitting at the next table. A new friend? A collaborator? Someone on the same path?

At the same time, finding a *great* café is still a gamble. Good coffee doesn’t always mean good Wi-Fi. Or power outlets. Or the right vibe to stay for a few hours.

That’s why I started working on **Lattecino,** a café-first app built around two things:

1. Helping people find genuinely great cafés to work from
2. Making real, low-pressure human connection possible in those spaces

I’m not here to pitch anything. I’m here because I want to build this *with* the community that actually lives in cafés.

I’d love your input on a few simple questions:

* What makes a café *work-friendly* for you?
* What do you wish you knew before choosing a café?
* Have you ever wanted to talk to someone in a café but didn’t?
* What would make connection feel natural instead of awkward?

If you used apps like BeanHunter back in the day, or if Google Maps just doesn’t quite get café culture, I think you’ll get where I’m coming from.

Thanks for reading. I’m genuinely curious to hear your thoughts and experiences.",1,1765551881.0,lattecino,0,1.0,False
1pku4r6,https://www.reddit.com/r/ExecutiveAssistants/comments/1pku4r6/finally_had_to_quit/,Finally had to quit,"This was my first EA position. I finally had to turn in my resignation. I applied because I was promised a full-time salary position with benefits and everything. My boss put me on a trial as an independent contractor and said I had to prove myself. But then just kept extending the trial month after month. So I was on call around the clock making $25 an hour.
When I turned in my resignation, all he said was find me another assistant. 
Communication was so hard. He would give me all these vague instructions telling me to contact certain people and send me pages long of voice text that went in 10 different directions. I would try to meet with him in person to get more clarification on who the people he was talking about and he would just say your job is to prevent my aggravation. I’m aggravated so just figure it out. I would spend so many hours on simple tasks because of it. He didn’t want to put gas in his own car so I would have to fill up his gas. Take his tires to get rotated. He would make me DoorDash him breakfast because he didn’t wanna make breakfast on my Saturday. I was basically his personal errand girl. He would double book things last minute all the time and then blame me. Sometimes he’d put me in a group text with his wife and they both would get mad at me. He never wanted to sit down and give me clear expectations.
I finally turned in my resignation after he accused me of doing nothing and that I shouldn’t even be working full-time hours so he cut my hours to part time even though he text me around the clock. Even at 2 AM. Everything that he listed saying I didn’t do, I had full receipts and proof that I did them. Even proof that he responded to the things that I did. It was crazy. He can’t remember anything. So he just thinks I sit and do nothing. And then he wants me to just sit at the office waiting off the clock until he gives me an immediate task like making him coffee. I was not doing that. 
He would get mad at me if I didn’t know his full medical history for things on the spot. I was expected to be just some magical mind reader. I couldn’t take it anymore. 
I put reminders on his calendar that I won’t work there after a certain date. I’m not sure he’ll remember and probably try to text me to do things. Lol rant over. It was the roughest four months of my life. ",5,1765551879.0,ExecutiveAssistants,6,1.0,False

I’m 24M, working in a startup in HSR. I’m trying to prep for SDE-2 interviews — system design + DSA. I used to do competitive programming in college, so I *can* study… but somehow every Saturday I sleep like I’m getting paid for it 😭

Weekdays are gone in office + traffic. By the time weekend comes, brain just gives “bro, not today” vibes and shuts down.

So a few things I wanted to ask:

1. How do you all stay awake and actually study on weekends?
Any tricks? Because coffee stopped working and fear is also giving diminishing returns 😅

2. Are there any free or cheap quiet study spots in Bangalore?
Libraries, cafés that don’t mind long sitting, anything.  
HSR / Bellandur / Koramangala side would be ideal.

3. Anyone here wants to be a study partner?
Nothing intense — just sit, study, maybe discuss a few DSA/system design points, keep each other focused, and prevent weekend-sleep-speedrun.

I’m a simple calm guy — veg, don’t drink, like quiet places, slightly introvert, a bit of dry humour, and mostly just tired. Working in a startup + prepping alone is tough, so thought maybe someone here is in the same boat.

So I've decided to vent! 

I'm all for TP-Link, I really am. But I feel cheated on, or should I say, I feel there is something missing here. 

Is it a bird? Is it a plane? Is it the sky? No it's the cloud! 

Let's start from the beginning. TP-Link is a fine brand. And I have and still will buy their switches! Love them. That's how I got to get to know Omada. But a switch is not the beginning of a network, there is a router and modem coming in front of them. But with omada, even if you start with the switch they should be honest from the beginnen, that it starts with the controller. 

And I hear the people screaming, software, hardware, whatever, why sell a product the millions of people use, to buy multiple versions of, without selling the glue to stick them together? The controller. 

And it is simply a fact, you need it if you want to make complicated monitoring networks. But why then not sell switches with the controller in it. I would pay more for it from the beginning, then come to the conclusions that you kind of, sort of need it in the end? Ik have 8 switches and love them, but why oh why is it so hard to get them all together on one platform, with the birdeye view? Without it going online, to keep going offline?

Start with the cloud, to emigrate, to then loose the cloud because of the emigration, and build the whole thing a new because, no desktop on, is no local control? What?

What is the point? To buy a controller that cost twice as much as a router or a switch, to run it locally? Or buy some pie, and invite you friend over for coffee? Or a NAS? You see, you need another device to start with. Why not merge and yes there is one, but the switch is not really a switch. I had everything, because I returned the gateway, in the hope I could get it all together, but I just ended up using it for 1 lan, the default lan of all the switches TOGETHER.

I have introduced myself about a month ago, then we talked for 10 minutes a few days after at like 12 am near the coffee shop with our friends when we were able to talk more. But since then most of the times its just been a greeting back and forth when we pass each other (sometimes i have talked to her a bit more than that but thats it). I did get her Insta when we first met, but as I am new to dating I was told by more experienced friends that you have to get to know her better before starting to text her there.

1pktvn7,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1pktvn7/theres_a_shadow_in_my_backyard_and_its_learning/,"There’s a Shadow in My Backyard, and It’s Learning to Be Me","It was 1:47 a.m. when I woke up with a start. I found it strange—I almost never wake up during the night. Normally, I sleep straight through, but now I was staring at the little digital clock with a dry mouth. Lucy wasn’t beside me in bed. For a moment I didn’t know where she was, then I remembered: she was working the night shift at the hospital.

Groggy, I crawled out of bed and made my way downstairs to the kitchen for a drink.



The house was empty and silent at night, just like the neighborhood. I loved this house: it was peaceful, in a good location, only a few minutes from downtown. The neighbors were good too—even if the houses and gardens stood close together, we never had any disputes. I was standing in the kitchen, actually thinking about organizing a barbecue party. I sipped at a glass of water—and that’s when I saw it.



A black silhouette. Barely visible in the night’s darkness, yet it stood out against it. At the back of the garden, far away near the fence. A human shape: tall, thin, its outline hardly discernible. And it just stood there, motionless, staring in through the glass doors of the terrace.



A chill ran down my spine. Who the hell was standing in my yard, staring in like that? For a moment, I didn’t dare move. The figure didn’t either. It looked as though it wasn’t even breathing. It just stared inside—stared straight at me. I felt that if I didn’t act now, it would make the first move.

It didn’t take long for my panic to give way to anger. I grabbed the flashlight I kept in one of the kitchen drawers and stormed out onto the veranda. I flung open the glass door to the yard, aimed the beam at the figure—and thought I had lost my mind.

Because there was no one there.

  


There was no one there. I scanned the entire yard. It wasn’t a big garden—Lucy and the kids kept it tidy—so I couldn’t even claim that someone might have hidden behind a bush or in tall grass. I didn’t know what to make of it. I chalked it up to my tired eyes and the fact that I’d been jolted awake in the middle of the night. I must just be exhausted.

I went back inside, to the kitchen, to finish my half-empty glass of water. But as soon as I reached the counter, I saw it again. Out of the corner of my eye, a tall black figure—its outline unmistakable. Standing out there in the garden exactly as before, staring inside.



I swallowed hard. I didn’t dare shout; Francis and Tommy were asleep upstairs, and the neighborhood was utterly silent. I kept my eyes fixed nervously on the motionless figure. This time I decided I’d go out again—but I’d chase it off, whoever it was. I wasn’t about to let someone terrorize me in my own home.



I stomped back toward the rear veranda door, never taking my eyes off the figure outside. I was almost at the door when I noticed something strange. The figure wasn’t just standing still. Its legs moved exactly as mine did. At first, I thought it was a coincidence… but when I stopped, it stopped too. Perfectly in sync.



As if I were looking into my own reflection—only outside, in the dark.

  


I panicked. I paced back and forth in the kitchen. Outside, the figure did the same. It stepped as I did. At first I really thought it was some kind of reflection, but there was something wrong about its steps. As if it were only just learning how to walk—sometimes clumsy, sometimes unsure of where to put its feet. What the hell was this thing in my yard? Why was it imitating me—and, more importantly, what did it want?



I didn’t know what to do. The only idea I had was to shine the flashlight at it again. But the moment I aimed the beam from inside the kitchen, there was nothing. Only the glare of the window reflected back at me. The garden was empty once more.

I switched off the flashlight, and the figure was gone. Vanished. Not even a silhouette at the far edge of the yard. It was as if it had seeped away into the darkness.

For minutes I stood frozen, terrified that it hadn’t truly gone—only hidden somewhere I couldn’t see. I must have stayed there half an hour, staring out through the kitchen window. I looked everywhere, but the figure was nowhere to be found.



Since it was early Thursday morning and I had to work the next day, I eventually went back upstairs. I checked on the boys: they were both sound asleep. From the bedroom window I kept watch over the backyard for a while longer, but the figure never returned. In the end, I drifted off to sleep—though every nerve in me dreaded waking to find it there again.

  


All day, the night before kept creeping back into my thoughts. Why had I woken up so startled? Who—or what—had been in my backyard? I told Lucy about it in the afternoon, but she thought I was joking. She insisted I must have been tired, maybe it was some kind of sleep paralysis. But deep down, I knew it was something else.



Night came again. Lucy had to work early the next morning, so she had already gone to bed. I couldn’t rest. The kids were asleep, and I stood in the kitchen, just watching. Sometime around half past midnight I dozed off on the couch. I woke stiff and sore. The house was dark, lit only by the glow of the television. Groggy, I stumbled into the kitchen for a drink of water. That was when I remembered why I’d stayed up so late in the first place.



It was there again. In the yard. The black, human-shaped shadow. Watching.



Suspicious, I stared back at it. I pressed closer to the window, trying to make out what it was. But it didn’t move—just stood there, tall and thin, a black silhouette.



Then an idea flashed in my mind. I rushed to grab my phone from the couch and sprinted back to the kitchen.

I snapped a picture, but in the night’s darkness, hardly anything showed. Maybe there was a figure on the screen… or maybe it was just some artifact of the grainy shot.



But as I held up my phone and took photos of the shadow, it began copying me. Clumsily, as if it didn’t really have proper fingers. It lifted its arm, but the wrist bent wrong, the fingers more like long, brittle sticks. It pretended to take a picture too, though its hand moved in a way that looked like it might snap in half.

  


I stared out the kitchen window again, nerves tight as wire. The black figure didn’t move—it just kept watching our windows. Then, suddenly, it began to shift. But this time, it wasn’t mimicking me. It moved as if it were searching for someone, glancing around in those jerky, clumsy motions. What the hell was it doing? Then, just as suddenly, it froze again.

  


“Gordon, what are you doing?” Lucy’s voice whispered behind me.

  


My heart nearly gave out. I hadn’t even noticed her. I’d been completely consumed, lost in watching the figure in the yard.

  


“What?” I stammered, startled.

  


“What are you doing, Gordon?” she hissed irritably. “It’s three in the morning and you’re standing here, staring out the kitchen window. What the hell are you doing?”

  


“Come, look!” I said quickly, almost excited.

  


Lucy walked over beside me. She had been heading for the coffee machine anyway, but at least now she peered out the window into the dark.

At first, she just rolled her eyes. But the moment she saw it, the color drained from her face. She stepped back, as if the glass could no longer protect her from the night. I could tell she saw it too. The figure in our backyard terrified her as much as it did me.

  


“What the fuck is that, Gordon?” she whispered, panic creeping into her voice.

  


I just shook my head. I didn’t know what we were looking at. Was it even human? Or was it something else entirely—something not of this world?

  


“Gordon, call the police,” Lucy said, pale as a ghost.

  


“And what am I supposed to tell them, Lucy?” I snapped back nervously. “That there’s a shadow in my backyard?”

  


She glared at me, furious now. I knew that look—if I pushed her further, she’d be far scarier than the thing standing outside.



Lucy was the one who finally called the police. She didn’t give me much time to react, but I understood—she was nervous and scared.

Meanwhile, I kept my eyes fixed on the figure while Lucy spoke on the phone. The black shadow didn’t move. Or rather, it just copied Lucy as she talked. As I watched, I noticed it was getting better at it—mimicking her gestures more smoothly, almost naturally.

  


“In a few minutes they’ll be here. What is that thing doing?” Lucy whispered, stepping up beside me.

  


“It’s copying you,” I said flatly. “While you were on the phone. Now it’s just staring.”

  


“This thing gives me chills, Gordon,” Lucy said, gripping my arm. “I feel so damn unsafe, and I’m scared for the kids.”

  


“The boys are fine,” I answered calmly. “I already checked on them.”

  


We didn’t move from the kitchen window. We just stood there, staring out, until Lucy finally noticed the flash of police headlights outside our house.



Two officers arrived. Lucy went upstairs to the kids, and I only looked away from the shadow long enough to let them in. But when we returned to the kitchen, it was gone. The yard was dark and empty.



The officers searched the whole garden, even took a quick look through the house, but they didn’t find anything. We didn’t tell them exactly what we had seen—truthfully, we didn’t know ourselves. I just said that someone had been standing in the yard, and we had no idea who it was.

The whole police matter went nowhere.



Lucy eventually left for work. I managed to get a little sleep after the officers were gone. They had promised to patrol the neighborhood and check in on our house from time to time.



The black figure didn’t return. But it took me a long time to fall asleep again—this had been the second time I’d seen it, and the second time it had simply vanished.

  


My Friday went by quickly. I dropped the kids off at school, and since it was Friday, I only had a short day at the office. But when I got home, I was in for a surprise: Lucy was sitting in the living room, all our things packed up for the four of us.



She said she wasn’t staying here any longer. We should all go to her parents’. But I didn’t want to leave our house. It was ours, our home. I wasn’t going to throw it away because of some shadow—I was made of tougher stuff than that. We argued for a while, and in the end she and the kids went to her parents’ for the weekend, while I stayed behind to settle this shadow business once and for all.



The first thing I did was get a camera. I set up a night-vision camera outside, aimed directly at the spot where the shadow usually appeared. My second step was buying a gas pistol. I was sure tonight would be the end of these scare tactics.



By evening, I had locked myself in the bedroom. I watched the garden camera feed from my laptop, running on pure caffeine to make sure I’d stay awake until the shadow finally showed up.

  


I must have dozed off. When I woke up, it was well past midnight. My laptop had already locked itself. Panicked, I unlocked it and switched to the garden camera.



The feed showed nothing. The yard was completely empty. But when I turned the volume up to hear the audio, I caught something.

  


 “Was it seen here yesterday too?” a man’s voice asked.

  


Then came only garbled noises, like someone trying to speak but unable to form words.

I knew it was the shadow. I grabbed the pistol and, like someone who didn’t know fear, stomped down to the kitchen.

It was there again, standing in the garden. The whole thing was baffling: on the camera, nothing showed—but in person, it stood right there. I yanked open the veranda door and aimed the gas pistol at the shadow.

  


 “Get the hell out of here, you bastard!” I yelled.

  


It didn’t move. Instead, with strange, twisted, sluggish gestures, it mimed aiming something back at me—though its hands were empty.

In my fury, I pulled the trigger. The pistol went off with a loud pop, and the round struck the garden fence. It passed straight through the figure as if it truly were nothing but shadow.

I stood there slack-jawed. How could I ever have thought a gas pistol would stop this thing? As I lowered my weapon, it lowered its hands too. I just stood in the veranda doorway, staring into the dark at the tall black silhouette that could never be fully made out.

  


“What the hell are you?” I whispered, almost only to myself.

  


“Gordon, what are you doing?” Lucy’s voice spoke.

  


But Lucy wasn’t there. She hadn’t come home to check on me. The voice came from outside—from the garden, where the figure stood.

Goosebumps covered me, my legs trembling.

  


“Sir, I’m afraid we didn’t find anything.” Another voice followed, this time a man’s. It was the policeman’s voice from last night.

  


Ice flooded my veins. What the hell was this thing in my garden? We’d lived here seven years—why now? Why here?

And that was the moment my courage gave out completely.

  


“What should I tell them, Lucy?” came my own voice from the garden.

  


And the instant it spoke those words, the shadow bolted—straight at me. It sprinted like a professional runner.

Terrified, I dashed back into the kitchen, snatched the car keys from the nightstand, and ran out the front door. Behind me I heard pounding footsteps gaining on me, and over and over, my own voice repeating:

  


 “What should I tell them, Lucy?”

  


I flew out of the house straight to my car. I jumped in, fumbling with the ignition. And then I saw it: a black figure standing in the open doorway of the house. It was so tall it nearly reached the top of the frame.



It didn’t chase me. It only stood there, staring. As I pulled away in the car, I caught one last glimpse of it in the rearview mirror—raising a hand to wave goodbye. First stiff and jerky, as if it couldn’t move its arms properly… then suddenly smooth, like the wave of an old friend.

Been a while since I posted here but just really need to vent. We recently had another appointment with our UK GP (our first application for fertility over a year ago was denied due to my wife's weight). My wife has now lost over 14% of her weight, dropping to 13st 3lbs which was what we were told would bring her to the appropriate BMI 30 - 32 to start the fertility application. Anyway, at this appointment we were told the target is now 30 or below, meaning my wife would need to get to 11st 5lbs or below, which she hasnt been since she was about 14-16 years old. Frankly i feel this is rather ridiculous that our HCB can keep changing the target, but also that they won't even start us in IUI or some form of medication to help with fertility while she continued to do all the hard work losing weight?! My wife now has regular periods and despite being initially diagnosed with PCOS (which our GP forgot to mention) she is beating the struggle with weightless and has none of the other symptoms.

Im trying to do my part, I've been sober for over a year now, nearly 2, dont smoke (neither of us do), no drugs, gym 3 times a week and drinking more water/cut out caffeine (from coffee and energy drinks) yet I feel that all the burden is being placed on her to lose weight at an excessive pace and to an unrealistic target without much support or explanation!

1pktn6k,https://www.reddit.com/r/dishonored/comments/1pktn6k/a_guide_to_solving_the_jindosh_lock_puzzle/,A guide to solving the Jindosh lock puzzle,"Hi all!

Huge fan of the Dishonored series here, played through all three games multiple times. I’ve noticed that people occasionally request help with the Jindosh lock. I know there are multiple walkthroughs and the like that will simply give you the correct answer, and you can of course also find the answer in-game in multiple ways without having to solve the puzzle.

However, what I *haven’t* found is a guide that helps you solve it yourself! So this guide will not give you the correct answer for your specific Jindosh lock (it changes from playthrough to playthrough), but instead it will teach you how to solve it on your own.

Simply put, the puzzle is solved through a process of a series of eliminations, but knowing how to think about the information presented in the puzzle in a way that allows you to actually make those eliminations can be a little tricky, so let's see if we can't help you learn how to do exactly that!

(Just a heads up – this post is LONG, so grab a cup of coffee and settle in!)

# The Puzzle

Here's the riddle we'll be solving, from my latest playthrough:

https://preview.redd.it/7qcp1cvq0s6g1.jpg?width=931&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6fd78cb7d49ea447c3cc114c4f9836739e4c025d

There's a lot of apparently nonsensical information here, but despite immediate appearances, all the information required to solve the puzzle is on the task! There are six complete categories of information here – seating, names, heirlooms, origins, drinks, and colors. However, if you look at the door where the lock is:

https://preview.redd.it/u5in5k4z0s6g1.jpg?width=1005&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=432bf4b1b88eb3fc78cfa6bfa1d1ae94d85c6201

You only actually need to input two of the six categories into the actual lock - the names, and the heirlooms. That said, we're still going to figure out all of the categories because it’s necessary to solve the puzzle.

# The Sheet

>^(First, a bit of information:)

>^(1. Categories are sorted into rows, and will be referred to as the specific category name (i.e. “color”), or collectively as “categories”.)

>^(2. Columns are sorted by the seating category, and will be referred to as their column name (i.e. “far left”), or collectively as “columns”.)

>^(3. Individual cells will be referenced using both the category and the column name (i.e. “the color-far left cell”).)

>^(4. The complete sheet will be referred to as “the sheet”.)

To solve the riddle, we will be using a table. I use Google Sheets, but any table-able (that's funny and you know it) program will do. Pen (or preferably pencil) and paper will also work, but will complicate redoing parts of the puzzle if you make any errors.

In the leftmost column you're going to put one category into one cell each, and then you're going to input **every single available option for each category in every single cell**. Your sheet should look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/llzbhxm51s6g1.jpg?width=1111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=76f646e6e1a6478dbaa430b7aa56571e5e5aeb61

You want to start off by locking a full category. That means leaving only one option in every single cell in that category. I picked seating because it pleases my order-oriented mind, and used the seating chart as my column names. That said, you can pick any category, the point is just to give yourself a reference point by locking a full category immediately. If you had picked i.e. names instead, the top row would have a single name in each cell instead.

Our goal is: only one option left in every single cell. No option features twice.

The game’s requirement is: Find out which lady owns which heirloom. Only one owner per heirloom, and only one heirloom per owner.

I’ll walk you through how to think about the riddle by going sentence by sentence through the first paragraph, and explain which options can be removed, and why. For the second paragraph I’ll simply tell you which options can be removed, and you can go through the paragraph and see if you can figure out the “why” yourself. At the end I’ll give you the correct answer, but I recommend trying to solve the remaining riddle yourself and then match up your result with my result.

# The First Paragraph

Let’s start off by looking at the first paragraph:

https://preview.redd.it/mwbfccup1s6g1.jpg?width=751&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f94d509e6d6a5e9325cb62fe07216d65c6902a38

Okay! Lots of information here, so let's dive into it!

The first sentence tells us that all the women are seated in a row, not across from each other. That’s why our seating category has the options far left – left – middle – right – far right. (Remember, I'm using this category as my reference point, hence why there is only one option in every cell.) These options are locked and will not change as the elimination process progresses.

The second sentence tells us two things - each woman wears a unique color (hence the color category), and that Doctor Marcolla wears red. At this time we can’t eliminate any options based on the information here, so we’ll move on to the next section.

The third sentence gives us two pieces of information - Countess Contee sits at the far left, and the person next to her wears white. Since we already locked the seating category, we can use this information! If Countess Contee sits at the far left, then her name is the correct option in the name–far left cell, and we can eliminate all the other options in that cell.

https://preview.redd.it/ujxxuxrt1s6g1.jpg?width=1113&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=de0d95e3dd6ca51eaa7f0fad1f63660acd3d5769

Hooray! We've locked our first cell! But here's an important thing to remember - now that we know where Countess Contee sits, we also know where she *doesn't* sit! Her name can now be removed from all the other name category cells, like this:

https://preview.redd.it/7qukp0av1s6g1.jpg?width=1111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8356abcc6231bc68e1da72b5e19bc39595959a13

And that’s really the entire secret to solving riddles like this - **every piece of information will give you a clue to where something is, but also where it isn't!** The information you receive might not be enough to lock a cell (although in this case it was), but it *can* be enough to eliminate a given option from one or more cells! That's really important!

The third sentence also tells us that the person next to the Countess wears white, and since Countess Contee is in the ""far left"" column, and since they’re all sitting in a row, the person wearing white *has* to be to her right. **Thus, we know where white is, and where white isn't**. Remove every color *but* white from the color-left cell, and remove white from every color cell *except* color-left. Additionally, remember that Doctor Marcolla wears red? The far left column is occupied by Countess Contee, which means you can remove red from the color-far left cell. Furthermore, the person next to Countess Contee wears white, which means it can’t be Doctor Marcolla, so she can be removed from the name-left cell. Your sheet should look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/som6vsh42s6g1.jpg?width=1111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98866e5ae4be855fd1b84fc5a56d63040b965d92

The fourth sentence tells us that blue is left of green. This information doesn’t tell us which column either color belongs in, but it *does* tell us something about where they *don’t* belong. If you take a look at the sheet, currently we have both blue and green as possible options in the far left column. However, because they are seated next to each other, it’s impossible for either to belong in that column, because the only adjacent column (left column) has already been locked by white! Thus we know that they must be somewhere in the middle-far right range of columns, and can remove both from the color-far left cell. This is why using a sheet of some kind is superior - it visualizes the information in such a way that you can start making eliminations entirely based on the information within the sheet. Awesome!

That leaves purple as the only remaining color in the color-far left cell, which means we in turn can eliminate purple from every other color cell it is still present in. At this time, your sheet should look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/sn7w72ga2s6g1.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f7e6b9653859897295f9dc70925505e1e5bd6b68

But there is more information left to use in our elimination process before we move on. Remember how the riddle says that blue sits left of green? That means that blue can’t be in the far right column, and that green can’t be in the middle column, so we can remove those colors from those color cells.

https://preview.redd.it/e3x8hu3c2s6g1.jpg?width=1111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b7265b2529534f02dd44c00a0ef14341ea011322

Now, an important piece of information has visualized in our sheet. Since blue and green *must* occupy adjacent cells, and since there are only three available cells for the two options, that means one of the two colors *must* occupy the right column. Thus we can remove red from that column.

That also allows us to remove Doctor Marcolla from the name-right cell, because when red no longer is an option for that column, Doctor Marcolla can no longer be the right name in that column.

https://preview.redd.it/nwufm2fj2s6g1.jpg?width=1112&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0157d8c8d75821d2201d3f15548447a85fb6dcf2

Okay, next sentence! Here we learn that the lady in blue drinks absinthe. Remove absinthe from every column where blue is *not* an option.

The next sentence tells us that the traveler from Baleton is dressed all in purple. We know that Countess Contee in the far left column is the person wearing purple, so let’s remove every option *except* Baleton from the origin-far left cell, and remove Baleton from every origin cell *except* the far left one.

The last sentence of the paragraph lets us know that the person owning the Bird Pendant sits next to the person from Baleton, which means that the Bird Pendant must be in the left column. Eliminate the appropriate options in the appropriate columns – your sheet should now look like this:

https://preview.redd.it/qaalj5ys2s6g1.jpg?width=1111&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2b9172ce97c6a4c6f1f508c31c39653b2444c0c5

Nice, we’ve eliminated quite a few options already, and we’ve still got a whole other paragraph left! For the second paragraph I will list the eliminations you can make on first readthrough – that is, the changes you can make by reading from start to finish once *without jumping back up and cross-referencing new information with old information*. Your job will be to figure out why the changes I list can be made. After that you should try to solve the remaining puzzle yourself, by applying the same logic until you are left with only one option in every single cell.

In the end I’ll post the solution, but I strongly recommend you try to find the solution yourself before you uncover mine, so that you can cross-reference them. If they don't match, try and figure out where you went wrong!

Let’s get to it!

# The Second Paragraph

Here’s the second paragraph:

https://preview.redd.it/v5vkiqhy2s6g1.jpg?width=734&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc415a422094e8f3b770c2f86a629b6870e1589f

1. Remove Lady Winslow from the name-left cell.

2. Remove Diamond from the heirloom-far left cell.

3. Remove Dunwall from the location-left cell.

4. Remove War Medal from the heirloom-far left cell.

5. Remove whiskey from the drink-far left cell.

6. Remove wine from the drink-far left cell.

7. Remove beer from the drink-far left cell.

8. Remove rum from every cell except the drink-far left cell.

9. Remove beer from every cell except the drink-middle cell.

Here’s what your sheet should look like at this time:

https://preview.redd.it/0mlr8foz2s6g1.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e91dd8e69f89c37c568badbf39e49fa8c2c926fc

Those nine eliminations should help you make further eliminations by re-examining older information. In fact, one elimination is glaringly obvious just by looking at the sheet – can you see it? >!It’s the absinthe in the drink-right cell – it’s the only cell absinthe is left in, which means absinthe must be in that cell. And didn’t we learn what color the person drinking absinthe was wearing earlier?!<

Keep going through the riddle and eliminate options until you are left with one option in every single cell in every single column. Once you’re ready, scroll down to see if you found the right solution.

# If you are not ready to see the solution, do not scroll down further until you are!

(Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a way to put only some images in a post behind a spoiler tag.)

# The Solution

Time to see if you got it right! Here’s the fully solved sheet:

https://preview.redd.it/clcpf2o53s6g1.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f34387f066f25c2d406d94c9be9e8eac5eeae6b2

And here’s proof that the lock opened using this sheet, confirming that the elimination process we used indeed got us to the right answer:

https://preview.redd.it/ez5k16x63s6g1.jpg?width=1505&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1491f79f92baeda7242f37f00f0883f5bb680d57

Did you figure it out? If not, did you figure out where you went wrong?

Remember, the key to solving all puzzles of this kind is to follow the following two rules:

1. Every piece of information will tell you where something is.

2. Every piece of information will tell you where something isn’t.

Knowing those two rules will allow you to solve these puzzles through a process of a series of eliminations until you are left with only one option in every category and column.

1pkt8t3,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/12/12/trump-can-make-american-healthcare-great-again/,Trump Can Make American Healthcare Great Again,"America used to be the undisputed healthcare leader of the world, yet today we are paying more and often getting less. For decades, Americans have been lectured that healthcare is complicated, prices are mysterious, and costs can only go up. Families have no real choice but to pay whatever bill arrives. But what if the real problem isn’t that healthcare is complicated, it’s that the system has been allowed to operate in the dark, where the industry, not the American people, come first.

Today, Americans are being crushed by healthcare costs that grow faster than wages. Often, these costs show up in insurance premiums that burden families and employers alike. Small businesses struggle with rising premiums that make it harder to hire, harder to give raises, and harder to compete. Yet, despite spending more than any country on earth, we still can’t answer the most basic question before getting care: *what will it actually cost?*

The good news is that President Trump can fix this and transform healthcare. The solution begins with something simple, powerful, and long overdue: give every American the right to see [real prices](https://www.showusyourprices.com/) before choosing their care and then the power to buy the care they choose. These two reforms, giving healthcare purchasers actual [prices](https://www.showusyourprices.com/) upfront and giving Americans greater control of their healthcare dollars, would put consumers in the driver’s seat and change health care forever. Together, they are the most pro-worker, pro-family, and pro-growth healthcare agenda in a generation.

Healthcare is the only major sector where Americans are expected to buy a product blind. It’s hard to imagine booking a flight, buying a car, or signing a mortgage without knowing what you’ll pay until you get a bill weeks or months later. Heck, [we wouldn’t buy a cup of coffee that way](https://twitter.com/trentengland/status/1995968968247705609?s=20). So, when it comes to our health, we should not be forced to make decisions without all the information. Nor should we trust a system that has become dominated by big businesses that benefit from hiding this information from us.

The Trump administration can act quickly to begin a domino effect of change by requiring mandatory advanced notice to patients that shows exactly what insurance will cover and what you will pay out-of-pocket – to let you know before you owe. This would give consumers a chance to plan, shop, and save on care. It would begin pulling back the curtain on costs that have traditionally been hidden until it was too late to find a better price.

Starting as early as 2026, the administration can make this a reality. And it’s [wildly popular among most Americans](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/24/exclusive-echelon-insights-poll-reveals-gop-midterm-boost-from-trumps-healthcare-price-transparency/). It gets to the heart of issues that Americans on Main Street care most about, including the cost of living and the availability of good jobs. [Giving power to consumers](https://dailycaller.com/2025/11/27/obamacare-deadlock-drags-on-but-one-healthcare-fix-could-slash-medical-costs-nationwide/) is the fastest path to lower bills, fewer surprises, and more financial security. It’s a tangible change Americans can see and feel before next November.

If we combine this price transparency with purchasing power — letting Americans shop for their own care — we will see a functional market begin to emerge. The Trump administration is well on its way with Executive Orders focused on “[radical transparency](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/02/making-america-healthy-again-by-empowering-patients-with-clear-accurate-and-actionable-healthcare-pricing-information/)” – Transparency in Coverage and Hospital Price Transparency rules – it just needs to implement and enforce those rules.

What makes these reforms transformative is that they shift the power away from big industry and into the hands of the [American people](https://saveourstates.com/). When we see real prices, we can make real choices. When transparency replaces secrecy, competition replaces complacency. And when healthcare costs finally fall, workers keep more of what they earn. That is how you reduce inflation. That is how you raise wages. That is how you grow jobs. And that is how you rebuild trust in a healthcare system that feels rigged against ordinary Americans.

Giving Americans the [power to choose](https://www.showusyourprices.com/) and buy their own care isn’t just a healthcare fix. It’s a cost-of-living fix, a wage-boosting fix, and an economic-growth fix.

It’s the rare reform that helps patients, workers, families, small businesses, and the broader economy all at once. Transparency is not only good healthcare policy, but also good politics and the kind of common-sense solution that will contribute to President Trump’s legacy.

This is the clear path to [make healthcare affordable](https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-simplest-way-make-american-life-affordable-again): Give consumers a [right to see](https://www.showusyourprices.com/) the real price, make the industry compete, and let Americans keep more of their hard-earned money.",1,1765549700.0,UsaNewsLive,0,1.0,False

1pkt5lo,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1pkt5lo/nonstop_dizziness_for_5_days/,Non-stop dizziness for 5 days,"21M, I’ll start with the most important information. I’m a drug addict, mostly using cocaine. Seven days ago, I was taking cocaine with alcohol, and to go to sleep as usual I took a sedative. I felt dizzy, but it was normal for me during a comedown. I ignored it and went to sleep. The next day, I continued drinking alcohol, and by night, I felt dizzy again. I decided to stop drinking and just went to sleep. I woke up, drank coffee, and felt dizziness again, so I stopped drinking coffee too. However, the dizziness has not gone away since that day. I’m a bit afraid to seek help from my local doctor because I live in a country with zero tolerance for drugs, so I’m asking for help here. My dizziness feels like I’m rocking, as if I’m on a boat. It doesn’t matter whether I’m lying down, standing, or sitting. It only gets better when I’m walking intensely or very busy with something. Focusing my vision doesn’t help, and turning my head doesn’t help either. It gets slightly better when I take a bath, but then it comes back. I also should mention that I have a scoliosis that was causing headaches sometimes. So my question is should I be worried, when it’ll get better and how to improve my situation?

Most of the operators I found are based in Bangalore and only offer 2D/1N packages that return the next day — but that’s not what I want.

Our plan is:

* Travel from Bangalore through KSRTC bus and Stay in Madikeri for 3 days and 2 nights
* Do local day tours on Day 1 and Day 3
* Relax on Day 2, enjoy local food and explore at our own pace

So I’m looking for **reliable tour operators or guides based in/around Madikeri who offer day trips** (e.g., sightseeing, waterfalls, coffee plantations, trekking, etc.). Open to both **group bus tours and private cabs**.

What’ve you wished past partners would do?,"Would love some feedback and some guidance if there’s any! I did end up reaching out to my ex a couple of days ago just basically said I know she’s going through it but I’m here if she wants me to be. She was sweet and said she hoped my Christmas holiday plans go well, but she’s still feeling like shit. I wasn’t expecting her to take the offer, it was more just trying to get the message through at a less “I’m in immediate crisis” moment.

We haven’t spoken since, I’m still worried about her but I know she’s alive because she checks all my stories like clockwork.

Depression is a beast and she said during the breakup that she thought she might be self sabotaging and isolating, but life’s just too intense for her and she couldn’t see a way out from the hole and didn’t want to hurt me or have me hurt her when I (eventually) realised she wasn’t perfect. Obviously in that moment nothing I could say could get through, and I’ve made some peace with the fact I have to leave her alone for the holidays so she can be with her family and hopefully regulate a little bit, and probably for a bit afterwards so she can find therapy and some new meds or something.

I was thinking about a low pressure coffee invite around the end of January or something (it lines up with some personal stuff having passed for both of us). ",1,1765549326.0,FearfulAvoidants,6,1.0,False

1pkt2zq,https://i.redd.it/6664p8hh8s6g1.jpeg,Ex'cla-ma'tion’ - a nostalgic ‘no buy’ cheapie treat!,"I struggled with the Black Friday sales. 

The problem was, I was meant to be on a self imposed ‘no buy’ since June and, to be frankly honest, I failed miserably having somehow acquired a few new bottles of perfume and a few discovery sets during the later part of 2025 - whoopsies!

So when November arrived, I knuckled down with determination. NO BUY! 

I’m expecting to be gifted perfume for Christmas, so any shopping can only be for other people. You can do this Curley Hen! But dear FragranceStories friends, it honestly near broke my heart when I was  purchasing a few perfume gifts for family online, seeing all the ‘I wants’ at great prices but telling myself ‘NO’. No more. You shall not pass!!!

So, I cheated… just a little. 

** Ex'cla-ma'tion** by *Coty* was seducing me from my screen at a very alluring price of £3.60. I mean, that’s not really a ‘buy’ if it’s pretty much the price of P&P? And it’s not fair buying other people perfume with out a little gift for myself?? But I’m not seeking penance for this guilty confession, in fact, I’m very much over moon at my little cheating treat.

Ex'cla-ma'tion, with its unnecessary amount of punctuation marks, is an absolute blast from the past of my teenage days. The moment I opened this and whiffed it, I was transported back to young and carefree days, which might have involved a bit of underage drinking, a sneaky cig round the back of the drama class mobile, a Kangol flat cap and a Rimmel Coffee Shimmer lipstick. 

Before I opened it, I was actually sitting in anticipation of an obtrusive and pungent whiff, having not smelt this in about three decades, but as the vapours hit my nostrils, the beauty of my glory days surrounded me in a sweet, fruity, floral, powdery scent cloud. Peach, apricot, iris and rose, blended together for a clean, slightly powdered perfume that has a faint spicy but fresh edge and a very gentle vanilla woody, musky base. 

And even though I thought I would hate it, but enjoy the olfactory induced memories, I’ve found myself enjoying the aroma! Who knew! I’m actually looking forward to wearing this a few times in the spring/summer of 2026. My colleagues are the same age group, so it will be fun to wear it to the office one day and see if the scent sparks any memories. And I’m going to do the same when I’m meeting up with my group of girlfriends. I’ll definitely be wearing it to bed after the winter gives way to warmer weather, really enjoying the scent, although I should acknowledge the bias of nostalgic memories.

Very much enjoying the trip down memory lane.. that being said, I do hope Santa doesn’t put me on the naughty list and brings me something a little more prestigious, I have been a very good girl after all. Promise! ",20,1765549286.0,FragranceStories,7,1.0,False

1pkt2k8,https://www.reddit.com/r/abusiverelationships/comments/1pkt2k8/chapter_1_the_life_i_built_and_the_love_i_found/,Chapter 1: The Life I Built and the Love I Found,"There was a time when my life felt steady, successful, and grounded — a life built from sheer perseverance and belief in something greater than myself.

I had carved out a career through hard work and endless sacrifice. I wasn’t handed anything. I didn’t come from wealth or connections; I came from grit. I had lived in my car for nearly nine months while I started my business — sleeping in the front seat, running meetings out of coffee shops, and scraping together just enough to get by. There were no loans, no family investors, no shortcuts. I built my company with less than $500 in my bank account and an unwavering determination to prove that I could make something of myself.

And I did.

After more than a decade of struggle, my company had become one of the most respected names in its field. We were expanding aggressively, forming new partnerships, and being recognized as a “go-to” group. I had earned not just success, but respect. People trusted my name. They saw me as one of the best — maybe the best — in my profession.

Outside of work, I had finally found balance. I owned a beautiful turn-of-the-century home in a quiet, small town in Michigan. Every summer, I would escape into the wilderness on solo camping trips — just me, my Jeep, and the open road. Those moments reminded me of who I was and how far I had come. I had built a life that gave me freedom. Peace. Stability.

I also held an MBA and a bachelor’s degree in Organizational Management. Teaching had always been another passion of mine — I had worked as an adjunct professor and was preparing to return to the classroom again. Life was good. Life made sense. I had meaning, purpose, and the satisfaction that only comes from earning everything with your own two hands.

Then she came into my life.

When we met, I believed she was everything I had ever hoped to find — kind, intelligent, charming, and full of light. We began dating in January of 2022. She told me she had been divorced for three years, and that she was ready to begin again. Our connection was immediate, almost electric. It felt as though the universe had finally rewarded me for all the years of struggle and patience.

We called each other soulmates. We said things like “You’re my person” and “This must be fate.” She told me she had never felt love like this before — that I gave her life meaning again. And for the first time in my adult life, I believed that love could truly transform everything.

Our days were filled with laughter, shared dreams, and long talks that stretched late into the night. We enjoyed the same things — pointless reality TV, travel, music — and our connection felt effortless. It was as if two parallel lives had finally converged. I saw not just a partner in her, but a family — her and her two boys, who I was ready to love and support as my own.

Her children had faced great challenges, including a difficult relationship with their biological father. She told me about the pain they endured, about her own health and emotional struggles, and I felt called — deeply called — to be there. To protect, to help, to heal. I saw her boys not as someone else’s children, but as two young souls who needed stability, love, and a positive example of what a father could be.

I made the decision — the biggest one of my life — to walk away from everything I had built in Michigan. I left behind the security of my business, my home, my employees, and my identity, and moved across the country to Connecticut to be with her. I did this because I believed in her. I believed in us. I believed that love — true, rare love — was worth any risk.

She knew what I was giving up. She had seen firsthand the scope of my work, the level of my success, and the countless hours I had invested to reach that point. She knew about my finances, my career milestones, my sacrifices — all of it. She would often tell me how proud she was, how impressed she was by how I carried myself with clients and colleagues, how professional and grounded I was.

 felt like we were a team. We talked openly about our future — marriage, family, dreams, and shared purpose. She told me she wanted to remarry. She said she wanted me to be a stepfather to her boys, to help build a new chapter filled with safety, warmth, and belonging. And I wanted that more than anything.

Our love moved quickly, but it didn’t feel rushed — it felt right. When I proposed to her, I did so with complete transparency. I told her everything about my finances — what I had, what I owed, what I earned — because I wanted us to build our life on trust. I made sure she knew the full picture. In return, she told me she was debt-free, that she had paid cash for her home and vehicles, and that her annual salary exceeded half a million dollars. She even spoke of a trust that would secure her children’s future and promised that I would never have to worry about money again.

But I never wanted her for her money. I told her many times that I would gladly sign a prenuptial agreement or any document that proved I was there for her — not her finances. She always refused, saying there was no need, that love didn’t require contracts.

In my mind, it was simple: love meant sacrifice, commitment, and faith. I had built my life on hard work and integrity, and I entered this relationship with the same heart. When she said she wanted to make me part of her family, to share her life and future, I believed her with everything I had.

I didn’t realize then that the very foundation I was standing on — everything I trusted and built my hopes upon — was about to give way beneath me...",1,1765549256.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False
