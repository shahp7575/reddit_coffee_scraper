*getting there- flew into SeaTac with SWA points (so free) Took the Amtrak cascades and not sure I‚Äôd do that again. Train is VERY dated and rundown. It‚Äôs late and takes 6 hours to get to Vancouver. 

You must get a balcony room! Idc if you have to scrimp and save, that balcony enhances the experience by a hundred fold. It was our favorite place to sit with a glass of wine in the evening. And you will have waning sunlight till almost 11pm

Burger and fries at Dive In were really good

We had the elite drink package. Which got us the Kendall Jackson Chardonnay. Multiple times a server had to go hunt down a bottle‚Ä¶like WTH? The first days we got conflicting info from servers about what exactly is included‚Ä¶specialty coffee? Told no. They are included. 
Can of water? Told no. They‚Äôre included. 

My biggest gripe is with the room cards. It is a huge pain to have to whip that thing out every time you order a drink. There has to be a better system. Half the time we didn‚Äôt sign the tab, so what‚Äôs the point. Can‚Äôt they just go to a bracelet that gets scanned or something?

I've been making pour overs for several years now, but have recently upgraded my setup from a Kingrinder K6 to a Fellow Ode Gen 2. I'm also using Third Wave Water now (which was a major upgrade from a water filter!) 

Up til now I've bought locally roasted coffees, or ordered different light roasts through my Trade subscription. But at this point, I'm looking into starting some subscriptions with a few highly regarded specialty roasters. I specifically have my eye on roasters like Hydrangea, S&W, Subtext, H&S, and Brandywine.

My question is, in your experience are the Ode Gen 2 stock burrs equipped to adequately highlight the tasting notes that these roasters have built such esteemed reputations around? I know the Gen 2 stock burrs typically produce higher body brews but more of a ""blended"" flavor profile. This terminology kind of worries me that I'd be missing out on what these coffees are truly meant to offer; I'd love to experience the spectrum of fruity, juicy, floral notes found across different washed, natural, and experimental methods. 

I see advice about the SSP burrs delivering laser-focused clarity, as well as grinders like the ZP6; but seeing as I exhausted my budget just to get the stock burrs, I wanted to see if the community felt like these would still do these roasters justice! If I'm going to do it, I want to make sure I'm doing it right :) Thanks all!",1,1753931884.0,pourover,2,0.67,False

**Essential Oil Blend**

The powder features a unique blend of essential oils, including peppermint, spearmint, and tea tree oil, chosen for their antibacterial and breath-freshening properties.

The concentration of each oil is carefully balanced to ensure efficacy without causing irritation.**Fluoride-Free Formulation**

Akamai is consciously formulated without fluoride, catering to consumers who prefer fluoride-free dental products.

I knew it was going to be difficult but I‚Äôm finding it unbearably painful knowing that I won‚Äôt get to see my friends pretty much every day, any more. 
One specific-relatively new- friend (bi) and I became close at the beginning of this year. Long story short, I developed feelings; they were not reciprocated in the same way but we ended up becoming even closer and ended up spending most of the past four months together. We went on multiple weekend trips together, experienced our first pride together, countless coffee dates, firework watching, concerts, and got even closer, to the point of cuddling, as the time of my move grew closer. 

We exchanged letters and playlists and said a prolonged two day-long goodbye.

I‚Äôm no stranger to homoerotic friendships (unfortunately moreso the toxic kind), but this one was just unbelievably intense and grew so much over such a short period of time that we both acknowledge our friendship as a ‚Äúmiracle‚Äù. It‚Äôs also obviously come with many of our mutual friends asking if we‚Äôre dating, which has always kind of hurt. I‚Äôve never claimed we are because of our boundaries but I often couldn‚Äôt help but feel that our friendship was unlike any other I‚Äôve felt before.

I don‚Äôt think I have ever grieved something the way I am grieving being with him. We are going to stay in touch and have even planned visits but the idea of not being able to see him as much makes me queasy. 

I‚Äôm obviously devastated to not see all of my friends as much anymore, but the fact that he and I developed such an emotionally intense (yet, extremely fun and fulfilling friendship) over such a short period of time, and that it‚Äôs getting pulled away just as fast is a different kind of hurt. How long should I grieve this? Is it that serious? Why am I hurting worse than any breakup- when we‚Äôre fine and will see each other again? Was I being delusional the entire time?

1mdqnc6,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1mdqnc6/torn_on_pursuing_barista_who_works_in_my_office/,Torn on pursuing barista who works in my office building,"In NYC. I‚Äôm black, in my early 30s, and an investment banker who has quickly climbed the ranks. One of the baristas on the 8th floor in my building is a gorgeous, early to mid-30s Afro-Latino woman. There are two cafes in the building where I work, both exclusive to my firm.

The first time I saw her, I thought she was attractive. I ordered coffee as I usually would and thought nothing of it. She was very friendly, but not overly so. The following two times I saw her, I just ordered my coffee and said hello as usual, but I noticed she became more inquisitive and open, and a bit friendlier with a huge smile on her face, which I assume was due to her recognizing me now. I thought nothing of it, but noticed she was much less open and friendly with my colleagues. She mentioned how she used to drink what I ordered, but switched to a different thing with less sugar. 

I saw her today (with a double espresso shot in her hand) at the service elevator on the 10th floor of the building. I was late to a meeting and forgot my badge, so I also had to take the service elevator. I said ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre [Maria] right?‚Äù She giggled, looked me directly in the eyes, and said: ‚ÄúYes! What‚Äôs your name again?‚Äù I told her (I remembered I had never introduced myself the first 2x), and she asked me how it was spelled (it‚Äôs a bit different from the standard spelling of my name). She said she liked the coffee better from the cafe on the 10th floor because it has a distinct flavor profile. I responded and commented, ‚ÄúHaha, I might need to try the coffee on this floor then, but I like coming to the 8th floor.‚Äù

About 30 minutes after seeing her (and after my meeting), I went to the cafe on her floor to finally have my first coffee. I commented about how I needed to change my order and get something with less sugar, and she said, ‚ÄúI get XYZ. I‚Äôll have to make it for you sometime.‚Äù I told her I‚Äôd take her up on that, said thanks, and walked away.

This probably sounds like a standard coffee shop interaction, but my gut feeling tells me to shoot my shot. However, I don‚Äôt want to make things awkward as I genuinely like the coffee from that floor. 

Am I being ridiculous? Should I take it a step further? I always see people discuss how men take a woman being friendly as flirting or interest, when that isn‚Äôt necessarily the case.",0,1753931369.0,dating_advice,8,0.33,False

I followed the manual from Moccamaster and the instructions for ratio or powder from Urnex and everything‚Äôs great.

My question is about the cleaner (not the descaling solution).

It advertises itself as a cleaner for coffee oils in the brew basket, reservoir and server.

With the Cup-One, the brew basket is removable and washable. The server is any mug, and the reservoir doesn‚Äôt come into contact with coffee unless it overflows and sucks it in due to back pressure.

It got pretty frothy, and seemed to do its job well, but how necessary is the cleaner for the Cup-One?

I suppose if there‚Äôs any other type of reservoir pipe build up that isn‚Äôt scale, it would help to keep the machine clean. I‚Äôm going to continue to use it maybe not as often as recommended but do the descale and then clean at the end of every filter box.

# Best green Cups 2025: Top Picks & Reviews

Choosing the right cup might seem trivial, but for many, it's a crucial part of their daily routine. Green cups, in particular, offer a blend of aesthetic appeal and eco-consciousness, aligning with growing consumer preferences for sustainable and visually pleasing products. In 2025, the market offers diverse options, ranging from reusable travel mugs too elegant glassware, each designed for specific needs and tastes. Selecting the best one requires careful consideration of factors like material, durability, insulation, and design.

This review aims to simplify the selection process by highlighting the top green cups available in 2025, providing detailed insights into their features, benefits, and ideal user profiles. Ultimately, it's about finding a cup that not only serves its practical purpose but also complements your lifestyle and values.

## Key Features Analysis

Selecting the perfect green cup involves understanding the technical specifications that set each model apart. Key aspects to consider include the material used, the insulation capabilities, the cup's capacity, its lid design, and its overall durability. Understanding these features enables a more informed decision-making process.

**Material Composition:** The material used in a green cup significantly impacts its durability, safety, and environmental footprint. Many top-rated green cups in 2025 utilize materials like stainless steel, borosilicate glass, or plant-based plastics. Stainless steel offers excellent durability and temperature retention,while borosilicate glass is known for its heat resistance and lack of chemical leaching. Plant-based plastics, though less durable, provide a more sustainable option to traditional plastics, reducing reliance on fossil fuels.

**Insulation Technology:** For those seeking temperature retention, insulation is a critical feature. Double-walled vacuum insulation is a common technology found in premium green cups, offering superior heat and cold retention compared to single-walled cups. Some models incorporate copper lining between the walls for enhanced thermal performance, keeping beverages hot for up to 12 hours or cold for up to 24 hours. The effectiveness of the insulation is directly related to the thickness of the vacuum layer and the quality of the sealing.

**Capacity and Dimensions:** The capacity of a green cup is a key consideration based on individual needs. Options range from small espresso cups holding around 6 ounces to large travel mugs capable of carrying 20 ounces or more. Dimensions also play a role in usability, with some cups designed to fit comfortably in car cup holders, while others prioritize a wider base for stability. Balancing capacity with portability is essential for users on the go.

**Lid and Closure Design:** The lid design greatly impacts the functionality and convenience of a green cup, especially for travel mugs. Leak-proof lids with secure closures are crucial for preventing spills, while features like sliding closures or flip-top lids enable easy access to beverages.Some lids include filters for brewing loose-leaf tea or infusing fruit, adding versatility to the cup. The material of the lid, often made from BPA-free plastic or silicone, also affects its durability and ease of cleaning.

**Durability and Longevity:** A high-quality green cup should withstand daily use and maintain its performance over time. Stainless steel and borosilicate glass cups are generally more resistant to dents and cracks than plastic options. The quality of the paint or coating on the exterior also contributes to its longevity, with powder-coated finishes offering superior scratch resistance. Look for cups with robust construction and durable materials to ensure long-term value.

## Core Benefits

Owning a high-quality green cup provides numerous benefits that extend beyond simply holding beverages. From enhanced beverage enjoyment to contributing to a more sustainable lifestyle, the right green cup can significantly improve your daily routine. The core benefits frequently involve temperature control, environmental obligation, and improved health.

**Optimal Temperature Retention:** One of the primary benefits of a quality green cup,particularly those with insulation,is the ability to maintain the temperature of your beverage for extended periods. This means enjoying hot coffee or tea throughout the morning without it cooling down too quickly, or keeping cold drinks refreshingly chilled even on a hot day. This is especially valuable for commuters or those who spend long hours at work or outdoors.

**Environmentally Kind Choice:** Choosing a reusable green cup promotes environmental sustainability by reducing the reliance on disposable plastic or paper cups. By consistently using a reusable cup, individuals can significantly decrease their contribution to landfill waste and reduce the environmental impact associated with the production and disposal of single-use cups. This conscious decision aligns with a growing global emphasis on eco-friendly practices.

**Health and Safety Considerations:** High-quality green cups are typically made from materials that are free from harmful chemicals like BPA, lead, and phthalates.This ensures that your beverages remain pure and untainted, eliminating the risk of leaching chemicals into your drink, especially when exposed to heat.Opting for a safe and non-toxic green cup is a proactive step towards safeguarding your health and well-being.

**Aesthetic Appeal and Personalization:** Green cups come in a variety of shades, shapes, and designs allowing individuals to express their personal style. Whether you prefer a sleek, minimalist design or a more vibrant, patterned cup, there‚Äôs an option to suit every taste. Customization options, such as adding monograms or choosing specific colors, further enhance the personal connection with your drinkware.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common questions from consumers helps clarify any uncertainties and provides additional information to aid in the purchase decision. Frequently asked questions include inquiries about cleaning, compatibility, and specific use cases. Addressing these concerns leads to confident buying choices.**How do I properly clean my green cup to prevent odors and bacteria?**
Proper cleaning is essential for maintaining the hygiene and longevity of your green cup. For most cups, hand washing with warm, soapy water and a non-abrasive sponge is recommended.For stainless steel cups, a mixture of baking soda and water can definitely help remove stubborn stains and odors.Ensure all parts, including the lid and any removable components, are thoroughly cleaned. Some cups are dishwasher-safe (typically top rack only), but check the manufacturer's instructions to avoid damage.

**Can I use my green cup for both hot and cold beverages, and will it affect the taste?**
Yes, most high-quality green cups made from stainless steel or borosilicate glass are suitable for both hot and cold beverages. These materials are non-reactive and do not impart any taste or odor to the drinks. Plastic cups *may* absorb flavors over time, especially with acidic beverages, so consider the material when choosing a cup for versatile use. Always follow the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines regarding temperature limits.

**What are the main differences between stainless steel, glass, and plastic green cups?**
Stainless steel cups are known for their durability, temperature retention, and resistance to corrosion. Glass cups offer a pure taste without any chemical leaching and are aesthetically pleasing but can be more fragile. Plastic cups (particularly plant-based options) are lightweight and often more affordable, but they may not retain temperature as well and could be susceptible to staining or absorbing flavors. Each material has its pros and cons.

1mdqk2k,https://www.reddit.com/r/orengeflame/comments/1mdqk2k/dimensional_watch_dxd_chapter_17_school_days/,Dimensional Watch DXD Chapter 17 School Days,"The sun had barely risen, casting a golden hue over Kuoh‚Äôs quiet streets. The air was filled with the scent of morning dew. Birds chirped cheerfully in the trees, and a gentle breeze rustled the leaves, promising a peaceful start to the day.

Inside the Hyoudou household, the scent of breakfast filled the air‚Äîfreshly cooked eggs, sizzling bacon, and the comforting aroma of miso soup. The kitchen was already lively, with Tamamo humming a tune while flipping pancakes and Yuuka stirring coffee, handing cups to Miki and Garou. Misuki, ever the caretaker, placed a plate in front of Sakura, who sleepily rubbed her eyes before starting to eat.

Issei, still groggy with sleep, trudged downstairs in an half-conscious state. His hair was a mess, his shirt was wrinkled, and his mind was only focused on one goal‚Äîbreakfast.

Everything was calm.

And then‚Äî

Knock! Knock!

Miki Hyoudou, already up and cheerful, hummed as she walked over to the door. The moment she opened it, she found their next-door neighbor, a spry old man in his seventies with slicked-back silver hair and the air of a retired troublemaker, stood with his hands on his hips, radiating absolute confidence. His wrinkled face stretched into a grin as his sharp eyes zeroed in on Issei, who had just stumbled down the stairs and into the doorway, still half-asleep.

‚ÄúDidn‚Äôt know you had it in you, kid.‚Äù He smirked, voice filled with admiration. ‚ÄúRespect.‚Äù

Issei froze mid-step, his brain grinding to a halt. His sleepy brain lagged. Processing‚Ä¶ Processing‚Ä¶ ""...What?!""

Tamamo, delicately sipping her tea at the table, giggled behind her sleeve. ‚ÄúUfufu\~! Word travels fast, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù She says as she recalled how loud their conversation had been yesterday night. The neighbors must have heard everything.

Yuuka, who was helping in serving breakfast, gave a plate to Garou, who was reading the newspaper. She raised an eyebrow. ‚ÄúWhat exactly is he talking about?‚Äù

‚ÄúSomeone must have been eavesdropping when we came to Issei‚Äôs home.‚Äù Misuki says as she sets another plate for Sakura to eat.

Miki leaned against the door, grinning. ""I told you our neighborhood was close.""

Issei‚Äôs stomach dropped.

Tanaka let out a hearty chuckle, clearly enjoying the clueless expression on Issei‚Äôs face. ‚ÄúOh, you know! The whole neighborhood knows! Three women? No, wait, was it four? And a kid already?! Damn, we all thought you were just some scrawny pervert, but turns out you‚Äôre a legend!‚Äù

Issei made a strangled noise, his entire soul leaving his body. ‚ÄúWho told you that?!‚Äù

But Tanaka was already walking away, whistling to himself as if he hadn‚Äôt just detonated a nuclear bomb in Issei‚Äôs morning.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

By the time Issei left the house, alone, heading to school, the rumors had already spread like wildfire.

And unfortunately for him‚Äî

People talked. Loudly.

Issei barely stepped onto the sidewalk when he overheard a group of elderly ladies, gathered outside Mrs. Sasaki‚Äôs house, were in deep discussion, their whispers only barely below shouting level.

‚ÄúDid you hear? The Hyoudou boy brought home four women!‚Äù

""I heard one of them called herself his wife!""

""And another one already gave him a daughter!""

""Miki was yelling about grandkids!""

Issei tripped over his own feet.

*‚ÄòThey think Sakura is my actual daughter?!‚Äô*

As Issei walked further down the street toward school, the whispers spread like wildfire.

And, just like a game of telephone, the story mutated every time he passed another group gossiping.

""You don‚Äôt think he‚Ä¶ kidnapped them, do you?""

""Oh, please! With a plain face like that? He must be LOADED!""

""I bet he‚Äôs a secret billionaire!""

Issei groaned, dragging his hands down his face. *‚ÄòWhy am I suddenly rich in this version of events?!‚Äô*

It got worse.

By the time he reached the school gates, the rumors had become urban legend material.

""I heard Issei Hyoudou is actually a genius who built his fortune in secret!""

""No, no! I heard he‚Äôs an underground crime lord! He finally settled down with his many brides after conquering the underworld!""

""Are you kidding?! He‚Äôs obviously royalty! You don‚Äôt just find four beautiful women and a kid overnight!""

""I heard his wives are ex-assassins that he defeated in combat!""

Issei came to a dead stop at the school entrance.

*'WHAT THE ACTUAL HELL IS HAPPENING?!'*

Before he could even react, the school‚Äôs biggest troublemakers rushed up to him.

‚ÄúIssei! You Bastard!‚Äù

Suddenly, two human missiles slammed into him from both sides. He staggered backward, barely managing to stay on his feet, as his so-called best friends, Matsuda and Motohama, latched onto him like rabid dogs.

Matsuda had tears of frustration in his eyes as he violently shook Issei by the shoulders, his grip filled with betrayal. ‚ÄúHow?! Why?! When?!‚Äù He wailed. ‚ÄúYou have a wife?!‚Äù

Motohama, adjusting his glasses with a dramatic shine, was practically vibrating with energy. ‚ÄúAnd an adorable daughter?!‚Äù

Issei‚Äôs head flopped back and forth like a ragdoll. ‚ÄúGAH‚ÄîLet go of me!‚Äù

‚ÄúNever!‚Äù Matsuda howled. ‚ÄúNot until you tell us everything!‚Äù

‚ÄúI aint telling you shit!‚Äù

Before Issei could even deny it, a new voice sliced through the chaos like a sharp blade..

‚ÄúIssei Hyoudou‚Äù

Aika Kiryuu, the perverted female version of him and his friends, had arrived. Her smirk was dangerous. Her smirk was dangerous. Her eyes gleamed like a predator that had just found its prey. She stepped closer, her movements slow and deliberate, letting the moment sink in.

‚ÄúSecret billionaire, criminal mastermind, harem king, and father?‚Äù She stepped closer, eyes sharp. ‚ÄúHow exactly did you pull that off?‚Äù

Issei opened his mouth‚Äî but nothing came out. He was lost in what to say. He simply left for class. With the three following him.

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

**Kuoh Academy, Classroom**

By the time Issei stepped into class, he was already mentally exhausted.

He had barely survived the absolute circus of insane rumors outside. Now, all he wanted was to sit down, pretend none of this was happening, and somehow get through the day in peace.

Too bad peace didn‚Äôt exist in his life anymore.

Because the moment he walked through the door‚Äî

Silence.

A suffocating, unnatural silence engulfed the entire room.

It wasn‚Äôt the kind of comfortable silence one experienced in a sleepy morning class. No.

This was the kind of ominous, horror-movie silence that preceded something terrible.

Dozens of female eyes snapped onto him, their collective stares boring into his soul. The sheer intensity of their curiosity was so oppressive, it felt like he had just walked onto a battlefield unarmed.

Slowly, stiffly, Issei shuffled to his desk and sat down.

The silence remained.

He gulped. *‚ÄòOkay. Maybe if I don‚Äôt say anything, they‚Äôll just‚Äî‚Äô*

Whisper. Whisper.

From the far side of the room, a girl leaned toward her friend, her voice barely hushed.

‚ÄúI heard he married a princess from overseas!‚Äù

Another student immediately added, ‚ÄúI heard he‚Äôs secretly part of the Yakuza!‚Äù

Issei twitched. ‚ÄòWhere are people even getting this?! I was only gone yesterday!‚Äô

His fingers drummed against the desk as more whispers began creeping into his ears. His patience frayed.

More voices joined in.

‚ÄúI heard his wives are all former assassins!‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, no! He‚Äôs actually royalty‚Äîhe was in hiding, but now his true identity is coming out!‚Äù

‚ÄúI refuse to believe that pervert is royalty.!‚Äù

Issei let out a long, suffering groan and slammed his forehead onto the desk.

‚ÄòThis is getting out of control.‚Äô

And then‚Äî

BANG!

The classroom door slides open.

Students flinched in their seats, some yelping in surprise.

And then‚Äî

She stepped in.

A short figure, clad in the Kuoh Academy uniform, strode into the room with graceful precision. Her movements were controlled, calculated, and filled with silent authority.

Her sharp violet eyes locked onto him, glinting behind the faint reflection of her rectangular glasses.

Sona Sitri.

The Student Council President.

Issei froze.

Oh no.

She adjusted her glasses, standing at the front of the class with the presence of a queen addressing her subjects.

Issei barely managed to keep a straight face as Sona Sitri‚Äôs piercing gaze bore into him like a predator eyeing its next meal.

The entire classroom was silent, the weight of every student's curiosity pressing down on him.

""Hyoudou,"" Sona said again, her voice calm but firm. ""We need to talk.""

Issei gulped, knowing there was no escape. ""Uh‚Ä¶ s-sure, Kaichou.""

Sona gestured toward the hallway, and he hesitantly followed, fully aware of the countless eyes burning holes into his back.

The moment the door shut behind them‚Äî

The classroom exploded with whispers.

""...Is he getting arrested?""

Someone gasped. ‚ÄúThe yakuza rumors were true?!‚Äù

‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî

The moment they were alone, Sona turned to him, arms crossed, her gaze unwavering.

""Would you care to explain?"" she began, adjusting her glasses. ""Why is the entire school suddenly buzzing with rumors about you?""

Issei let out a nervous chuckle. ""Uh‚Ä¶ define buzzing?""

Sona narrowed her eyes.

""Secret billionaire. Crime lord. Royalty. Assassin harem master.""

Her deadpan tone combined with her utterly unamused stare made Issei want to crawl into a hole.

He groaned, dragging a hand down his face. *‚ÄòOh my God, it‚Äôs even worse than I thought.‚Äô*

Sherri‚Äôs voice chimed in through his mind, her tone dry and unimpressed. ***‚ÄòMaster, I do believe you've set a new record for most absurd rumors in a single morning.‚Äô***

*‚ÄòNot helping, Sherri.‚Äô*¬†He muttered internally.

Sona let out a sigh, rubbing her temple. ""I eventually expected ridiculous rumors involving you, but this is excessive. What exactly is going on?""

Issei scrambled for an answer, his brain working overtime.

Then‚Äî

***‚ÄòMaster, I can provide a solution.‚Äô***

Issei barely resisted the urge to sigh in relief. He subtly adjusted his wrist, pretending to scratch it as he listened.

***‚ÄòTell her that a family is currently staying at your house due to unfortunate circumstances. This will explain the presence of multiple women without raising supernatural suspicion.‚Äô***

*‚ÄòGood thinking, Sherri!‚Äô*

""Ah, about that‚Ä¶"" Issei rubbed the back of his head sheepishly. ""It‚Äôs really just a big misunderstanding.""

Sona arched an eyebrow. ""Go on.""

""Yeah, um‚Ä¶"" He forced out an awkward laugh. ""A family is staying at our house because of, uh, some misfortune they ran into.""

Sona's eyes narrowed slightly, but she seemed intrigued rather than outright suspicious. ""A family?""

Issei nodded quickly. ""Yeah! They‚Äôre kind of‚Ä¶ in a tough spot right now, so my parents let them stay with us. And, well‚Ä¶ people kinda blew it out of proportion.""

Sona studied him closely, as if trying to detect any deception in his words.

Then, after a long moment, she nodded.

""I see."" She adjusted her glasses. ""Then that would mean the rumors of you suddenly being married, adopting a child, or running an underground criminal empire are all‚Äî?""

""Completely false!"" Issei cut in before she could even finish.

Sona stared at him for a long moment.

Then‚Äî

She sighed and relaxed slightly. ""Very well.""

*‚ÄòWait, really? That worked?!‚Äô*

But Sona wasn‚Äôt finished. ""Then allow me to ask something else while we‚Äôre here.""

""Huh?""

Sona‚Äôs sharp gaze locked onto him once again. ""You mentioned this family. I assume one of them is school-aged, and I've been informed that there's a request for a transfer student‚Äîone Yuuka Hana, to enroll at Kuoh Academy for her final year. Is she supposedly linked to you?""

Issei blinked. ""Wait. You mean Yuuka?""

Sona nodded. ""I'm assuming this is related to the family staying with you?""

*‚ÄòDamn. She‚Äôs sharp as always. Oh, this is my chance!‚Äô*

""Yeah! Actually, the girl staying with us needs to finish her final years of high school.""

Sona studied him again, then nodded. ""That‚Äôs not an unreasonable request. If she has the necessary identification, I'll have Saji handle the paperwork. Expect a formal meeting later to go over the details.""

Issei let out a huge sigh of relief.

*‚ÄòHoly crap, I managed to fix something for once!‚Äô*

Sona adjusted her glasses. ""Just‚Ä¶ try to avoid any more ridiculous rumors, Hyoudou.""

""...Yeah, I can‚Äôt promise that.""

She gave him an unimpressed look before walking off.

‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî ‚Äî

As Issei stepped back into the classroom, the entire room fell silent.

Dozens of female students turned to look at him, their wide, expectant eyes locked onto his every movement.

It was the kind of stare one might give a man walking into his own execution.

His movements felt unnaturally slow as he shuffled toward his desk, each step heavy with dread.

He barely slumped into his chair before‚Äî

""Did you get arrested?!""

Issei nearly fell out of his seat. ""WHAT?! NO!""

But it was too late.

Like a dam breaking, the classroom erupted into chaos.

""What did she say?! Are you getting expelled?!""

""Is she secretly your fianc√©e?!""

""Wait, wait‚Äîwas it about the Yakuza thing?!""

Issei slammed his forehead onto the desk, his patience obliterated.

*‚ÄòKill me. Just kill me now.‚Äô*

Sona had barely interrogated him for five minutes, and yet somehow, the school had already built an entire conspiracy web.

Thankfully, the lesson finally started, forcing everyone to calm down. The whispers gradually faded as the teachers took control, and for the first time since waking up, Issei had something resembling peace.

The morning lessons passed in a blur.

Issei barely paid attention, his body exhausted from the relentless rumors and insane speculation. But despite everything, a small victory lifted his mood.

He had managed to get Yuuka‚Äôs transfer started.

*‚ÄòFinally! Something that actually went well today!‚Äô*

He sighed in relief, stretching slightly as lunch break arrived.

As he pulled out his bento, a rare, content smile crossed his face.

*‚ÄòAt least I can relax and eat now.‚Äô*

But the moment he opened it‚Äî

A heavenly aroma of expertly crafted, restaurant-tier food wafted into the air.

For a single, fleeting second, Issei was too distracted by the sheer beauty of the meal before him to notice the looming danger.

""What is this?!""

A pair of hands slammed down onto his shoulders, shaking him violently.

Matsuda and Motohama had pounced.

Matsuda‚Äôs eyes were wide, trembling with emotion. ""This is not your usual food, Issei!""

Motohama, adjusting his glasses with a suspicious glint, leaned in. ""This aroma‚Ä¶ this presentation‚Ä¶ this level of craftsmanship‚Ä¶""

His voice dropped into a dramatic whisper. ""You didn‚Äôt make this, did you?""

Issei tried to shove them away. ""Back off, it‚Äôs just my lunch!""

But they were already inspecting the bento like detectives examining a crime scene.

The rice was shaped into tiny hearts.

The tamagoyaki had ""For My Darling\~"" written in sauce.

A small note was tucked into the side. ‚ÄòEat well, my beloved\~! Ufufu\~! ‚ÄìMizukame.‚Äô

A long pause.

Then‚Äî

Matsuda screamed.

""You‚Äôre actually dating someone!!!""

The entire classroom turned to look.

Hundreds of heads snapped toward them like owls spotting prey.

The noise level spiked instantly.

And then‚Äî

Aika Kiryuu appeared.

Like a devil summoned by sheer chaos, she materialized beside them, her grin positively wicked.

""Ooooh\~?"" Aika purred, eyes glinting mischievously. ""Who‚Äôs this? Mizukame, huh?""

Issei‚Äôs soul left his body.

He slammed the lid shut. ""NO ONE!""

Motohama glared at him. ""It‚Äôs literally written in sauce.""

Matsuda grabbed him again, shaking him harder. ""You have a girlfriend?! You?! How?!""

Issei wanted to die.

But it was too late.

His classmates exploded.

""The pervert actually has a girlfriend?!""

""How did that pervert pull that off?!""

""He must be blackmailing her.""

Issei‚Äôs eye twitched violently.

""I am not blackmailing anyone!""

Aika giggled, looking way too entertained. ""Oh, Issei, you're never living this down\~!""

And with that‚Äî

The harem rumors continue to grow.

The sun hung low in the sky over Kuoh Academy. The once lively school was now winding down, with students either heading home or staying behind for club activities.

For Issei, the day had been long.

Painfully long.

His mind still reeled from the absurd events of the day‚Äîthe wild rumors, Sona‚Äôs interrogation, and the lunchroom disaster that had officially labeled him as ""the pervert who somehow has a girlfriend.""

*‚ÄòI just want to go home and see some boobs.‚Äô*¬†He was sure that Tamamo or Yuuka would let him hug them and allow their boobs his mental stress.

He had almost made it.

He was steps away from the school gate, freedom within reach.

And then‚Äî

""Issei!""

His stomach dropped.

Before he could react, a pair of arms slung around his shoulders.

Matsuda and Motohama. His so-called best friends.

The duo flanked him on either side, grinning like maniacs.

Matsuda wiggled his eyebrows. ""Brooo\~! You seem like you're in a hurry! Going home to your special someone, hmm?""

Motohama adjusted his glasses, the lenses gleaming dangerously. ""Or maybe‚Ä¶ you're heading home early so you can finally get rid of your V-Card?""

Issei choked on air.

""What?! No! That‚Äôs not‚Äî!""

Matsuda ignored him and wrapped an arm around his shoulder. ""C‚Äômon, man. Before you go back to your new and improved ‚Äògirlfriend-having‚Äô life, how about we do something fun?""

Issei narrowed his eyes. ""‚Ä¶Fun how?""

Matsuda and Motohama exchanged devious grins.

""You see,"" Matsuda said, ""the Kendo Club is practicing right now‚Ä¶""

Motohama smirked. ""And we were thinking of doing a little ‚Äòextracurricular viewing session.‚Äô""

Issei‚Äôs eye twitched.

They wanted to peep again.

Of course they did.

Issei hesitated.

It was tradition, after all. The three of them had attempted to spy on the Kendo Club multiple times, though they usually got their asses handed to them by the female members.

*‚ÄòOn one hand‚Ä¶ Kendo girls‚Ä¶‚Äô*

But then‚Äî

He thought about the people waiting for him at home.

Yuuka, Misuki, Tamamo‚Ä¶ and of course Sakura. And then there was Ddraig. The dragon had made him promise to start training. He had already delayed it long enough.

*‚ÄòI gotta start taking things seriously‚Ä¶‚Äô*¬†As memories of distress about not being able to fight back and punch that blond bastard or the beat down from the shitty priest. Never again.

Issei sighed, shaking his head. ""Sorry, guys. Can‚Äôt. Got things to do.""

Silence.

Matsuda and Motohama froze, their expressions twisting into sheer horror.

Matsuda grabbed his shoulders. ""You‚Äôre turning down peeping?! Who even are you?! What have they done to you?!""

Motohama gasped. ""Oh my god. You‚Äôre whipped.""

Issei twitched. ""I AM NOT WHIPPED!""

Matsuda dramatically recoiled. ""He‚Äôs in denial. Classic signs of a man in chains!""

Motohama shook his head. ""It‚Äôs over, man. He‚Äôs gone. Our brother is truly, irreversibly‚Ä¶ domesticated.""

Issei gritted his teeth.

""I'm not domesticated! I just have actual priorities!""

Matsuda sniffled. ""Listen to him‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs responsible now. So tragic‚Ä¶""

Motohama patted his back. ""Rest in peace, Issei Hyoudou. Gone, but not forgotten.""

""WHATEVER!"" Issei threw their arms off and marched off toward the school gate, ignoring the whispers behind him.

""Yup. Definitely whipped.""

""Domesticated as hell.""

""Think he already calls her ‚Äòhoney‚Äô?""

""SHUT UP!""

As he stormed away, he could hear their snickers.

But he didn‚Äôt care.

He had escaped.

Now, all that was left was home.

By the time Issei reached his neighborhood, he felt like he had barely escaped with his life.

Between the rumors, the interrogation, the lunchroom fiasco, and his idiot friends declaring him ‚Äòdomesticated,‚Äô he was mentally fried.

*‚ÄòAt least now I can finally‚Äî‚Äô*

The moment he opened the front door and he froze.

Because kneeling in the entryway, clad in aprons over their completely bare bodies, were‚Äî Yuuka and Tamamo.

Both smiling.

Both looking way too smug.

And then‚Äî

""Welcome home, Darling\~!""

Issei‚Äôs soul momentarily left his body. His brain blue-screened. His sanity screamed. His nosebleed confirmed his demise.

Yuuka‚Äôs voice was sweet and playful, but the mischievous glint in her eyes made his stomach drop.

Tamamo, of course, beamed.

""Would you like dinner, a bath‚Ä¶""

They both leaned in. Eyes glinting. Voices sultry.

""Or us?""

Issei‚Äôs face exploded red as blood spurted from his nose. ""‚ÄîHUH?!""

Tamamo giggled behind her hand. ""Ara, ara\~! My dear husband is so flustered! Could it be‚Ä¶ he actually wants to choose us?""

Yuuka smirked. ""C‚Äômon, Issei-kun\~! You‚Äôre always talking about stuff like this at school. What‚Äôs the matter? Can‚Äôt handle it?""

Issei backed up immediately, waving his hands frantically.

""W-WHAT?! WHY ARE YOU EVEN SAYING THIS?!""

Tamamo tilted her head.

""Because it‚Äôs fun\~!""

Yuuka laughed. ""Your reactions are priceless.""

At that moment‚Äî

Misuki walked in from the living room, casually carrying a cup of tea. She took one look at the scene in front of her, arched an eyebrow, and sighed.

""Really, you two?"" she said, taking a slow sip of her tea. ""At least let him take his shoes off first.""

""We‚Äôre just doing what our mother-in-law told us to do.""

Tamamo‚Äôs cheerful response made Issei choke on his own spit.

""SHE WHAT?!""

A small voice. From behind the couch.

Sakura, peeking out innocently, blinked. ""‚Ä¶Papa is red.""

Yuuka grinned. ""Yup! His perverted brain, probably short-circuited!""

Issei sputtered. ""My brain did not‚Äî!!""

Before he could finish, Tamamo hugged him.

Tightly.

His face was immediately buried into her chest.

Warm. Soft. Heaven.

Tamamo gently stroked his hair. ""There, there, my darling\~!"" she cooed, pressing him even closer. ""Don‚Äôt worry! I‚Äôll always be here to pamper you\~!""

Yuuka rolled her eyes. ""Yeah, yeah. Whatever. Just hurry up and get inside before the neighbors see us and the rumors get worse.""

As Tamamo continued hugging him, her warmth melting his stress away, Issei couldn‚Äôt help but smile.

A perverted, satisfied smile. *‚ÄòI love my life.‚Äô*",1,1753931098.0,orengeflame,0,1.0,False

1mdqjm2,https://www.reddit.com/r/interracialdating/comments/1mdqjm2/anyone_here_know_if_a_polish_woman_could_get/,Anyone here know if a Polish Woman could get along with a Mexican American?,"  I am 46, male, clean cut type, no tattoos, college grad, non smoking, no drugs, only social drinker. Catholicism is important in my life, but I can't always be at church every weekend. 
  Last week I visited a Polish Catholic Church, not to attend Mass because I only know Spanish and English. I visited to sample Polish food, but I got there a little early and had to be somewhere else later. I just had PoIish pastries, coffee and left. I was the only tan looking person there, but did not feel out of place. People did look at me, but not in a negative way (when it is in a negative way, you can feel it). People were polite, welcoming, and receptive. The woman selling the food, even suggested that I go back again at a later date, she said they were going to be changing menus soon. I also noticed the place was kept very neat, clean, and organized. The women around there were also not bad looking.
  Later that day, I decided to look up a Polish restaurant because I was curious about Polish food. So I drove 1 hour away from home just to go to a Polish restaurant. Again, I was the only tan person in there, but no one made me feel uncomfortable. It was the complete opposite. One man with his family asked me where I was from, etc. and so on. When I was leaving, he asked me if I liked it, I said of course. He thanked me for visiting and said that he hoped I would go there again. Key takeaway : Poles were very nice, and welcoming. They did speak English with a little bit of an accent, so they are not Poles born here in the US. Is it part of the culture to be very welcoming to people that look different than them. I myself don't look White, but don't look like Pancho Villa either. More like 60% of the actor Mario Lopez, in that range. If Poles are generally receptive and warm, I am thinking that is a start, right? They are allowing me to prove I am a productive member of society and a practicing Catholic, like many of them are. Then the rest is probably up to me, right, to make friends at least with the guys to see if they know single women, right?

1mdqjj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/NepalSocial/comments/1mdqjj8/isnt_there_a_difference_between_free_market_and/,Isn't there a difference between free market and syndicate?,"The whole world has learnt that free market in every thing will never lead to prosperity of the average citizens.


Let's talk about a small thing that is relevant to my life.

There are cafe/bakery who use instant coffee like Nescafe to serve coffee and charge Rs.150/cup. When I said this to my very intelligent mate, he said ""Free market brooo, if you think it should cost lesser, go and start a new coffee shop"". It was disappointing to hear that from him. Because not everybody can go and open a bakery shop. And my another smart mate told me, ""Go to other shops, not to that one who's charging 150"". I went to  other coffee shops that were still charging Rs.100/cup of instant coffee. It seemed like they had no idea that there are coffee beans and even the coffee made by machine costs Rs.180/cup for cappucino. 

I've experienced such kind of syndicate in Kathmandu valley, pretty often.


Again, take another example. Study room. Study rooms doesn't mean an entire dedicated room for 1 person. It means just one cubicle and yo stay in a same room with 40 other people. You're provided a charging socket, electricity per cubicle. And the room is open from 6am-10pm. It costs Rs.3000/month if paid monthly, Rs.200/day. On top of that, they also charge Rs.1000 for admission (Seriously! What's its purpose besides trying to force you keep coming to that study room forever). When I told this to my friendly Indian friends, they told that I was paying too much. And in India, these facilities are available at Rs.1000(starting with 500BHARU), that too with AC. Even in Indian metro cities, cubicles don't amount to Neru.3000

Now, when I told this to my gifted friend, he told me ""Najane tirna nasake, ghar mai basera padne"". I was really hurt. Not everyone has a study environment at home. Specially if it's their home, then relatives keep coming and there is always disturbance.

Someone said  ""library jane public, tei gayera padne"". But the concern is public libraries are a mere formality in Nepal. They contain very less seats for students and open in office hours only. Democratic government has never thought of investing into libraries. 

I am deeply concerned about the situation. And I want to learn how to make my voice heard?",1,1753931054.0,NepalSocial,2,1.0,False

Price wise--3 bags of coffee--each whole beans 12 ounce weight and the Phin for $65 . I hadn't read the beans close enough. I wanted to strictly try Robusta as I felt it was the only way to truly make Vietnamese coffee.

Only one bag is Robusta which is where I wanted to go (their Hanoi--$16 on their site--bit more on Amazon $20).   The second bag is their Saigon (which is blended Robusta and Arabica beans at $16 on their website--$19 on Amazon. The third bag is their Dalat at $18 --which is 100% arabica--$19 on Amazon.  Price wise I felt happy $50 for 3 bags of coffee. $15 for the Phin--buying from Nguyen. Amazon wise it would have been $58 for the coffee and $21 for the phin (total of $79) so I saved $14

I'm confused though----I thought to have ""authentic Vietnamese Coffee I should be strictly drinking Robusta.  So one of their brews is Arabica ( granted it's sourced from Vietnam) The other brew is a blend of Arabica and Robusta.  In Vietnam are they drinking Arabica and blended Arabica and Robusta?

1mdqev5,https://www.reddit.com/r/copypasta/comments/1mdqev5/pasta/,Pasta,"Pasta with Italian sausage and feta cheese.  

1 lb Italian sausage.   (I like hot, but mild works fine.)

1 large can finely diced tomatoes.   
1 bag egg noodles (any pasta works, this feels right)
Handful of fresh chopped basil
2  cloves finely chopped garlic
1 container of feta cheese. Crumbled. 8 Oz?
Several bottles of red wine.  Cab.  I tried it with a zin and it was too sweet.  Get something you will both enjoy.


Call a friend you want to seduce.  Brush your teeth and wash your face again.  

Fry up 1 lb of Italian sausage, without casing.  Crumble the hell out of it.  

Drink some red wine.  Are they here yet?

When the sausage is browned throw in the garlic and stir for one minute, then add the tomatoes (juice from the can is fine, if you chopped them yourself you are a better person than I am, but add 1/4 cup of water to help deglaze)

Offer your guest a glass of wine.  Tell them they look nice, and wouldn't they be more comfortable taking off their shoes?  

When the tomatoes and sausage are happily simmering pour in 1/2 cup of red wine.  Stir.  Continue to simmer,  you want those tomatoes to cook.  Probably 15 minuted or so.  Put the water for the pasta on.  Add salt.  It doesn't make the water boil faster, but it makes the food taste better.

Sit down with your friend and offer them more wine.  That coat is beautiful,  right?  But they wouldn't want it to get stained.  Red wine.  Hang it on a hanger, don't throw it on the back of a chair.  Tell them again how nice they look, and sit closer this time.  Put your arm around them, look them in the eyes and encourage them to talk about themselves.  Don't talk about your job, tonight is about them.

Water is boiling,  add the pasta.  Check the sauce.  How is the reduction going?  Too thin, raise the heat.  Too thick add some more wine.  It should be close (fish out a tomato bit on a spoon and ask your guest to try it.  It shouldn't be too firm.  Mushy but still a tomato bit is good, the sausage adds texture.  Watch them chew.

OK, veggies and bread (garlic bread is good, but tonight is about love) are good.  I know you remembered dessert.   You can eat that with coffee later.

Drain the pasta, pour it into a bowl.  Pour the sauce over the top.  I know, sounds crazy but it lets your guest got as much or as little sauce/pasta as they want.  Their happiness is what's important.   Sprinkle the feta cheese and chopped fresh bssil on top.

That routine started off with the cat waking me, demanding to be fed.  To be fair,  this wasn't just true on Thursdays.  That feline monstrosity demanded to be fed twice a day, every day.   If a few extra calories could filched between meals so much the better.

After drinking my coffee and taking a rinse I headed out the door for my appointment. 

I greeted the wide-eyed nurse.  She didn't ask my name, she knew exactly who I was.  
Testosterone treatments are common for men (and some wonen) as they get older.  Low testosterone can manifest itself as a lowered sex drive, loss of muscle mass, and reduced energy, increasing fatigue.
But not a lot of people know where the world's supply of testosterone comes from.  That's where I come in.  Once a week I make my way to the doctors office, greet the nurse, chat with the doctor and relax as they draw a sample of my blood.   It doesn't take a lot; just a few small vials are enough.  

Those are taken to a lab where they are spun in a centrifuge and distributed to medical centers around the world.  Europe, Asia.  The southern portion of the United States of America use a significant portion.  

Years ago medical journals would sometimes write articles about me.  I don't crave attention, and do my best to stay out of the limelight.   I still get requests a few times a day for interviews, usually from young attractive reporters or newscasters looking for a spicy story to titillate their audiences.  

I turn them down, every time.

I tried low-acid beans, cold brew, even mushroom coffee... but nothing worked consistently.

Then I learned that the key isn‚Äôt just the type of coffee‚Äîit‚Äôs **how your body buffers the acid load** that comes with it.

# Why Coffee Is Acidic

Coffee contains a mix of **chlorogenic acids**, **quinic acid**, and other organic compounds that lower the pH of the beverage and contribute to **gastric irritation**, especially in people dealing with:

* GERD / acid reflux
* Gastritis or LPR
* Dietary acidosis
* Kidney stress

The solution isn‚Äôt necessarily giving up coffee. It‚Äôs about **buffering the acidity** both **in the cup** and **in your body**.

# What Alklyte Does Differently

**Alklyte** is a powdered blend of:

* **Sodium Bicarbonate**
* **Potassium Bicarbonate**
* **Sodium Citrate**
* **Potassium Citrate**

These compounds are the **exact same types of buffers your body naturally produces** to stabilize pH and neutralize acids. When added to coffee (or taken with water before/after drinking), Alklyte:

* **Neutralizes the free hydrogen ions** (acid) in the coffee directly
* **Provides systemic buffering support** that reduces the total dietary acid load
* Helps protect the **gut lining** and **kidneys** from chronic acid stress

It‚Äôs not just about raising the pH of the coffee itself‚Äîit‚Äôs about improving the way your **entire body handles acidity** after consumption.

# Real-World Impact

Since using Alklyte, I‚Äôve gone back to enjoying coffee without fear of flare-ups. I don‚Äôt rely on PPIs or chalky antacids anymore. Just a scoop of Alklyte stirred into my morning coffee or taken in a glass of water beforehand has made all the difference.

And the science backs this up. **Citrate and bicarbonate salts** have been shown to:

* Reduce symptoms of **GERD and reflux**
* Improve **acid-base balance** possibly helping those with chronic kidney disease (ask your doctor first before using if you have CKD because it contains some potassium)
* Support **gut barrier function** and microbial balance
* Help reduce **dietary acidosis** linked to fatigue, inflammation, and metabolic dysfunction (see recent posts in this group for peer-reviewed studies)

# Takeaway

You don‚Äôt have to give up coffee to feel good‚Äîyou just need a better buffering strategy. For me, that‚Äôs **Alklyte**.

* Have you tried alkalizing your coffee?
* What buffers or supplements have helped you?

**Music preferences** \- Grunge and metal make up 60% of my listening. Another 30% to post-punk, shoegaze and alt-rock. Final 10% is just whatever I'm interested in or randomly shazamed; can be whatever genre, good music is good music. There is a special place in my heart for heavy riffs with a female vocalist. My noobish understanding of what this means for my preferred sound profile is mid-range and treble are what I want my perfect headphones to excel at. In general I can say I don't care for bass regardless if that is true or not. 

**ANC** \- I have bose QC ultras and am completely satisfied with their ANC capabilities. Would settle for a bit less. 

  
**Comfort** \- I can wear the QC ultras all day no problem at all. I'd consider these my baseline. Anything less comfortable is a hard no-go. I often wish they felt more premium in their materials. I tried on a pair of Sony XM6s and was repulsed with how uncomfortable they were even for just a couple minutes. My ear touched the driver immediately. I seem to value premium materials and deep ear cups with the QC ultra earcups being just deep enough. Weight wouldn't bother me. 

*Potential audible* \- Are there any ANC capable things in the wired/closed back world? Maybe my noob is really showing here - but If ANC capabilities could fall similarly in line to QC ultra like I had mentioned I have no issue with being limited to a wire and not being wireless. Busy coffee shop/airplane use are the main settings, though. 

All in all if something was similar in sound quality but more premium materials and comfortable to wear the latter criteria would be much more important to me. I say this because everything at the high-end will probably sound amazing to me considering I'm not an audiophile (yet). I know I would be really annoyed if something felt like it could never get loud enough I like to crank my shit.

I don't even know who I was over the last year, but I wasn't myself. I still can't adopt another cat. I still miss him terribly.

I made it 5 miles up the road. Ran into unexpected torrential rain and I tried to get slowed down but the highway curved and I hydroplaned, like I‚Äôd hit a sheet of ice. Never did regain control. Went off the highway at prob 55 mph, bounced off an embankment, traveled around 100 yards while rolling at least twice, and landed on the roof in a ditch, held up by my seatbelt. I never lost consciousness, never felt a hit to my head. I unbuckled and panicked trying to find the door handle and then panicked again when I realized I couldn‚Äôt push the doors open. I was wedged in a ditch & something was smoking. 

Everything was everywhere, and covered in my fresh coffee. I realize Siri was calling 911 for me. Then 2 dudes in a truck pulled up and when I heard them yelling if anyone was in there it could have been Jesus himself. They manhandled my car door and pried it open & got me out.

I walked away. I have nasty airbag burns but I am otherwise fine. Car is totaled, obviously. 

It wasn‚Äôt until I got to the tow lot and looked at my car that I remembered I still had my bowling bags in my cargo area from last night. Unrestrained, only partially blocked by the backseat. And when I opened the back door, I realized they‚Äôd both ejected from the cargo area. Once the car was flipped back onto the tires, my unpadded 47 pound 3 ball roller bag was found wedged against the back of my drivers seat. My spare ball backpack had ended up in the back passenger seat. It‚Äôs beyond me how one of them didn‚Äôt fly into my compartment like a deadly missile and kill me.

Looking at the car & realizing I don‚Äôt have even so much as a piece of glass wedged in me was surreal. All the broken glass I could have landed on when I unbuckled, or could have unknowingly stepped on or touched when looking for my phone, and I have not a single cut.

Tried a lot of antihistamines and H1, H2 blockers. Now only 1 in the morning and 2 antihistamines before bed. They sometimes work well sometimes don't.  
About 2 months ago I started autologous blood desensitization, the process of using a one's own blood to help reduce or eliminate allergic or immune reactions. Each time they draw 5cc of blood and reject into your body. I've been on this treatment for 2.5 months. Actuaclly I did see improvement. I use UAS7 tracker and see a significant drop in the score. Currently I have less than 20 hives, and they do itch but not to extent that I can't bear. I don't scratch them. but they still come daily, mostly when I wake up and before bed. It's been 5 fucking moths.  
What's making me really upset is that this dermatogolist always asks me about my diet. My IgE is only 23, and never have food allergies. I eat clean and avoid seafood/nuts/dairy/fermented food/any high-histamine foods. I don't eat any fruits/snacks, even quit coffee and tea with caffeine! Every time he asks me what I eat, I feel I'm questioned. It's like telling me I'm not going far enough or my diet must have been the cause.  
The previous dermatologist told me CSU isn't diet-related, as long as I avoid major no-nos, which I did!  
Blood tests showed no abnormalities, thyroid checked, potential autoimmune diseases ruled out.  
I tried cyclosporine before for only 2 weeks, then I switched to this dermatologist for the autologous blood desensitization. Should I go back and try cyclosporine for longer? I can't afford Xolair. It's not covered by any insurance plans in my country (Taiwan). I understand my hives have become more bearable, I can work I can sleep, but occasionally they get worse, though not as severe as before. I really want my life 100% back. I don't want to always check the menu to make sure there's something I can eat when I go out with my husband. It's mentally exhausting. I'm paranoid as well, the first thing I do when I wake up is to check how many hives I have.

Last time I shared an unboxing pic, and some people asked me to share how it‚Äôs been after using it for a while. So, here‚Äôs a quick rundown of what I think, especially some aspects I saw people usually care about. 

\- Route planning: The x8 does great in planning its route when vacuuming and mopping. It automatically goes around my sofa, coffee table...I set up the map, and it follows the routes on it, it hasn‚Äôt gotten lost so far. I can also tell the app to clean specific areas and check cleaning history, its interface is straightforward. Basically, I set it up once and then just let it run on its own. 

\- Cleaning performance: It‚Äôs got a roller mop with a self cleaning feature, so the mop always stays clean while it's working. Honestly, it cleans the floor better than the old mop I used before. 

After using it for a couple of weeks, the floors at my place are cleaner, and I‚Äôm cleaning more often now. I used to mop once or twice a week, but now it runs almost every other day, and the whole place feels tidier. And honestly, it‚Äôs way easier than cleaning by myself. Of course, it‚Äôs still a machine, so you have to do regular maintenance like emptying the dustbin and cleaning the mop holder, which can make it live longer.

[In the first month](https://www.reddit.com/r/capsulewardrobe/comments/1llcjo0/capsule_wardrobe_for_june_month_1_of_no_buy/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), I focused on mixing and matching interchangeable pieces in my wardrobe to see how many new outfits I could create. For this month, my goal was to go through my entire collection of summer dresses, which are usually the pieces I‚Äôm most tempted to buy when I‚Äôm bored.

My most worn piece this month was the grey striped linen dress, which I worn at least once a week to three times a week. I wore it to picnics at the park, coffee shop co-working dates, grocery runs, trash pick ups, literally anything. It was casual but put together, and could easily be dressed up or down. Definitely a great piece that makes me look and feel effortless while requiring actually no effort from me.

**Looking through my favorite dresses, I noticed a few things:**

* My favorite dresses all share some common traits: v-necklines, waist emphasis, and good materials. They also feel like they feel like me rather than just being ‚Äúpretty dresses.‚Äù They're also very versatile and can be dressed up (with heels) or down (with sandals or sneakers).
* Of the 13 dresses, more than half had v-necks and about 80% are midi-length or midaxi. All but one dress are patterned, with more than half having floral patterns. Of the 13 dresses, 4 have dark colors while the remaining 9 have more medium to light colors.
* There is actually one more dress that I forgot about this month: knee-length solid black satin dress that I throw on when I just need to wear something. I‚Äôm not a fan of the materials so don‚Äôt reach for it during the hot weather. It‚Äôs literally an okay but uninspiring dress.
* There were a few dresses that didn‚Äôt look the most flattering in photos or don‚Äôt have a strong waist emphasis, but I still love wearing them because they feel amazing on:
   * Mini polka dot dress: fun and playful, very easy to throw on, and dressed up or down depending on the weather. This is actually my year-round piece, which makes it even more special.
   * Light yellow midi dress: just super beautiful and dreamy
   * White striped dress: I do have a to dress up a bit with this dress to match the slightly more daring version of my usual vibe.
* Fabric matters A LOT. In the heatwaves, I live in linen and cotton dresses. Unfortunately, some of my favorite pieces have a lot of polyester or other synthetic fibers that feel not great during the hot weathers. These, I save for places with where I know will be blasting the AC.
* Special shout out to the blue floral halter dress. I got this from a street vendor in Vietnam nearly a decade ago, and it‚Äôs still the perfect piece to wear when I‚Äôm feeling bloated and still need to stay cool. Covered up with a cardigan, and it becomes a lot more elevated.

**Dresses that feel the most like me:**

* The polka dot midi dress: this dress always makes me feel like a million bucks. I think it‚Äôs because it hits all of my styling points: the neckline and overall shape are both very dramatic classic. It also hits my essences: natural (flowy at the bottom and moderately open at neckline), classic (v-neck and waist emphasis, overall shape), and ethereal (light polka dots and ruffles detailing). AND it‚Äôs actually a soft black, which fits perfectly with my preferences for dark summer colors.
* The grey striped linen dress: Similar to the polka dress, I think this one covers a lot of my styling points as well: the overall shape and moderate fabric make it a great dramatic classic piece. For the essences, it has mainly natural (flowing shape, relaxed) and classic (belted at the waist, the stripe pattern), and the ethereal essence comes through in my styling, which is usual small, delicate gold and pearl jewelry and hairstyle.

**Dresses that wear me instead:**

These are the dresses that always get me a lot of compliments, but the compliments usually are about the dress itself rather than me in it. I usually feel too big/too small/not sexy enough/etc. in these, so I try to style them a bit more to compensate.

* Leopard dress: too body-ody when I usually don‚Äôt feel this body-ody. Also a bit too warm for my coloring, despite being a slightly cooler beige. I prefer it with a white button up for more structure and coverage.
* Floaty orange dress: too unstructured; makes me feel undone. The oranges are so cute but are too warm for my coloring. It feels more me when I give it more structure with the white cardigan.
* Pink floral dress: LOVE this color palette and floral patterns, but the fabric feels too light and flimsy on me (in contrast to my favorite dark polka dot midi dress). With the mini length, it feels too delicate for me. Like with the others, I prefer to give this more structure with the white cardigan.
* The red dresses:
   * The red midi dress is something I reach for when I‚Äôm looking for more of a statement piece, but the red is a slightly too bright for my coloring. However, it has a lower neckline, so the brightness doesn‚Äôt bother me as much. But when it does, I like to tone it down a bit with the white cardigan.
   * The red maxi dress was something that was perfect when I worked in a lab, but I definitely feel a bit cocooned in it, which can be a good thing. I don't always go for it when I'm breaking out because it brings out the redness in my skin, and the polyester doesn't feel good during the heatwaves.

Overall, month two of my No Buy Summer really clarified what I actually love and reach for, which will help me narrow down what to buy for next summer. At the same time, I‚Äôm realizing I already have quite a lot of clothes, so it isn‚Äôt really necessary to buy anything at all. I never intended to collect so many dresses, but dresses have always been weakness for me. 

I do still want to add one more linen dress that can be worn casually or dressed up, but it feels like a low priority that can easily wait until next year. In the meantime, I‚Äôm happy with my current collection. Many pieces have been repaired or altered to fit better, and I‚Äôm grateful for them. I also brunch locally and in NYC often enough, so it‚Äôs nice to have different options to cycle through.

Are my expectations too high or are my feelings valid?

‚Äî‚Äî

I consider myself a generally thoughtful/considerate friend.

I try to check in with friends often. I prefer to call over text, but I do answer texts still of course. If I find myself in a busier time in life, I make sure to communicate that I may not respond to texts as quickly so I don‚Äôt leave people in the dark.

If I‚Äôm out, if I see something that reminds me of a friend, I‚Äôll take a picture and send it to them let them know I was thinking about them:) (just every once in a while; almost an equivalent of sending a social media post that makes you think of someone)

If I‚Äôm with my roommates and I‚Äôm ordering food for myself, I ALWAYS tell them to see if they want to jump in on the order, or if they want anything.

If I‚Äôm studying with some friends, and I‚Äôm making coffee for myself, I will always offer to make them a coffee, or if they want snacks, water, etc.

If someone says they‚Äôre going thru a busy or hard time in life, I will ALWAYS tell them that I am there if they need me, and I‚Äôd be happy to help them if needed.

My friends want someone to run errands with? I‚Äôm there! If you are overwhelmed and need help cleaning your apartment??? Hell yeah I‚Äôll help!

What made this come up is that I‚Äôm on a trip with my friend (24F) now, and she really hasn‚Äôt put in any effort to speak to me at all. She has been on the phone constantly speaking to other people. I feel ignored if I‚Äôm not the one to initiate conversation.

I had to walk through her room today (after knocking) to wash all the towels in our air bnb because they were all dirty and we ran out; the only access point is the door to her room to get outside. I asked how she was doing and how her day was, and she answered ‚ÄúI‚Äôm fine, it was fine‚Äù. No questions from her, she did didn‚Äôt ask me about my day or anything.

Tonight, she was about to walk out the door and I had to stop her to ask where she was going because she was going to leave without even saying goodbye. She said that she was going to pick up her pizza‚Ä¶

Personally, if I was ordering food, I would‚Äôve asked her if she wanted anything. Is it weird of me to see that is inconsiderate?

I think I‚Äôm quite self-aware; I normally have a pretty good idea if I ever do something to make someone upset. So I really do not believe there is anything I could have possibly done to make her upset.

Other things have happened in our friendship in the past that has made me feel like I was putting a lot of energy into the friendship, and that it wasn‚Äôt being reciprocated‚Ä¶

Is it unrealistic to expect the same energy I put out from other people (the things I spoke about in this post)?

All I know is, I just feel pretty frequently let down with friendships. Maybe I‚Äôm the problem for having expectations that are too high. But please give me an unbiased opinion if you‚Äôre reading this!

1mdppoc,https://www.reddit.com/r/ForexExpertAdvisor/comments/1mdppoc/the_hard_truth_about_forex_why_most_retail/,The Hard Truth About Forex: Why Most Retail Traders Never Turn a Profit,"# 1 | The dream and the data

Few markets are marketed as aggressively as spot foreign exchange. Social-media ‚Äúmentors‚Äù flaunt luxury cars, while broker adverts trumpet *instant freedom*. Behind the glossy fa√ßade, regulators force every EU CFD provider to display a line most marketers hope you will skim: **‚ÄúBetween 90 % and 95 % of retail accounts lose money.‚Äù** 

That warning is not a scare tactic; it is the statistical baseline. Independent studies on day-trading returns find similar patterns, with several papers estimating that **90 %‚Äì95 % of individual traders end up net-losers**. In other words, if you randomly pick a retail trader, the odds that they are consistently profitable are worse than one in ten and often closer to one in twenty.

# 2 | Why the odds are stacked against you

|Structural hurdle|What it means in practice|
|:-|:-|
|**High leverage**|A 1 % adverse move on a 1:30 leveraged position wipes out 30 % of margin. Small errors become catastrophic quickly.|
|**Razor-thin spreads‚Äîbut constant cost**|Even a 0.3-pip spread is 100 % certain, while profits are only probabilistic. Costs compound; edge decays.|
|**24-hour flow from smarter money**|Banks, HFT firms, and macro funds trade the same pairs with real-time flow data you will never see.|
|**Emotional volatility**|Fear of missing out (FOMO) and loss-aversion lead to revenge trades, premature exits, or oversized positions.|
|**Survivor bias in education**|You hear loud success stories, not the silent majority who closed accounts and moved on.|

Regulators echo these concerns. In its 2024 strategy letter to CFD brokers, the U.K. FCA identified ‚Äúpoor governance around leverage offered to novice clients‚Äù as a core consumer-harm driver. 

# 3 | The myth of the ‚Äúgolden strategy‚Äù

Most new traders hunt for a *perfect* indicator combo Fibonacci plus stochastic, order-block overlays, AI signal bots. That search almost always ends where it began: at break-even or worse. Markets are **adaptive systems**; once an inefficiency becomes popular, professional desks arbitrage it away. What separates the rare winners is not a secret PDF but a **portfolio of transferable skills**:

* **Probabilistic thinking:** treating every trade as one of thousands, never a make-or-break event.
* **Rapid feedback loops:** journaling, tagging, and statistically reviewing trades weekly.
* **Risk throttling:** adjusting size dynamically when volatility or personal focus changes.
* **Emotional regulation:** knowing when *not* to trade is often more profitable than adding size.

These attributes look like *instinct* from the outside, but they are trainable through deliberate practice, not paid signal groups.

# 4 | Signs it might be time to pivot

1. **Multiple blown accounts** with no written trading plan.
2. **Consistent net losses** after > 500 live trades and rigorous journaling.
3. **Chronic stress** or deteriorating personal finances because of trading.

If you tick two or more boxes, consider reallocating capital to passive diversified investments while treating trading as a hobby-sized experiment. Remember: *opportunity cost* is real. Every year spent chasing break-even in FX is a year your capital could have compounded elsewhere.

# 5 | A realistic roadmap for the determined minority

|Milestone|Objective benchmark|
|:-|:-|
|**Year 0‚Äì1: Education & micro-sizing**|*Trading in the Zone*Read classic texts (e.g.,  ), trade demo, then micro-lots risking < 0.25 % per idea.|
|**Year 1‚Äì2: Statistical edge hunt**|*expectancy*Back-test, forward-test, and track   (average win √ó win-rate ‚Äì average loss √ó loss-rate).|
|**Year 2+: Capitalisation & scaling**|Only if 12-month live track-record > Sharpe 1.0 and drawdown < 15 %, start compounding size slowly.|

Treat each checkpoint as a *gate*. Miss the metric? Stay put, refine, or exit the game.

# 6 | Final thoughts

Forex can be a fascinating puzzle and a legitimate profession for a **tiny** cadre of traders. For everyone else, it is closer to a casino with better coffee. Acknowledge the numbers, respect the leverage, and be brutally honest about whether the skills described here feel natural or forced. If they feel forced, your time and capital will almost certainly earn a higher return elsewhere.

Success in FX is therefore not about finding the *right* course or guru; it is about discovering whether you possess and can polish the rare combination of statistical thinking, emotional discipline, and adaptability that the market relentlessly demands.

On the late night of August 12, 1997, I went out on a date at Lockhart Smokehouse. I returned to my apartment ‚Äî 2508 Ivy Brook, in Arlington ‚Äî early on August 13. Later that morning, I called my boss to say I‚Äôd be late for work.

I never showed up.

On January 5, 1998, some hunters found my body in a wooded area near a creek, in the 6200 block of Baraboo Drive, Dallas. I‚Äôd been shot.

During that time, a homicide task force had been formed by the Fort Worth Police Department. Several female bodies had turned up across the region. Mine was one of the cases they investigated...

David ended the recording, saved the file, and shut his laptop with a soft click. He slid into bed, exhaustion pulling at him. The room was still, lit only by the dim red glow of his audio interface.

In sleep, the memories crept in.

The air had smelled like rain. And something sweet, jasmine maybe.

There were flashes. Fragments.

A red scarf flapping in the wind.
Someone calling his name.
A scream sharp, then swallowed by silence.
He saw her. Maybe.

A silhouette at the top of the stairs. Her face turned. Or missing. Blurred like an old photograph left in the sun too long.

He woke in the dark, gasping. Heart hammering against his ribs like it wanted out.

His shirt was soaked. The sheets too. Cold sweat clung to him the kind that whispered something was wrong, even if you couldn‚Äôt name it.

He sat upright, unmoving. Just breathing. Fast. Shaky. Trying to piece it together.

Then, across the room, he saw on the wall.

Old newspapers. Crime scene photos. Handwritten notes. Pinned and webbed together by red string.

At the center, written bold and unrelenting:

Who did it?

Chapter 2: Whispers from the File

The night clung to the city in heavy silence. Outside, the occasional hiss of passing cars. Inside, only the low hum of David‚Äôs computer and the soft buzz of his desk lamp.

He sat at his desk, headphones around his neck, eyes on the screen. Ashley‚Äôs voice still echoed in his mind. Her story had rattled something in him not just sadness, not just anger.

Something else.

Familiarity.

He leaned back and stared at the ceiling for a moment, letting the stillness settle. Unheard Voices had started years ago, back when he was barely old enough to rent the apartment he now lived in. It was supposed to be about giving victims a voice. It still was.

But somewhere along the way, it had become something more personal.

Something unfinished.

He glanced toward the corkboard in the corner, his mother‚Äôs case still taking up the most space. A shrine of frustration and stubborn hope.

""MOTHER OF ONE FOUND DEAD IN FORT WORTH ALLEY ‚Äì NO SUSPECTS""
The headline stared back at him, circled three times in red.

He rubbed the back of his neck, stood up, and stretched.

Just for a moment, he reached for a few older folders from his filing cabinet. Something in Ashley‚Äôs case had struck a chord, but he couldn‚Äôt name it. So he followed the feeling.

He laid out a few past episodes, the ones that had stayed with him longer than most.

Episode 1 ‚Äì Natasha Lane (covered year one)

Episode 2 ‚Äì Lana Walters (season two)

Episode 3 ‚Äì Emily Monroe (last year)

Episode 4 ‚Äì Ashley Thompson (just posted tonight)

He flipped through them without purpose, just letting instinct guide him. They were years apart different seasons, different moments in his life. He hadn‚Äôt thought of them as connected before. Still didn‚Äôt.

But something about them, it stirred that gut feeling again.

Same unease. Same weight behind the words.

Like they were circling the same storm, without ever realizing it.

He let out a breath and pushed the thought aside. There was no clear connection. Not yet.

Just a feeling.

He put the folders back and returned to his desk. Ashley‚Äôs waveform still glowed faintly on the screen.

With a few quick clicks, he closed the project and opened a new  blank folder.

He started digging around online, pulling up case files, local forums, archived police reports. That‚Äôs when he stumbled on her name:

Regina McClain.

Murdered in 2018. Found near a drainage ditch just outside Mesquite. Gunshot wound. Purse still on her. No signs of struggle. No suspects.

Barely covered in the press. One article. One photo.

He opened the file and leaned in.

She was smiling in the photo, a hand resting on her hip. A blurred brick wall behind her, maybe a restaurant. Nothing jumped out. Nothing obvious.

Then came the police report. Sparse. A timeline. Witness statements. The medical examiner‚Äôs note.

And then, at the very bottom of the scanned scene log, something strange.

""Found torn scrap of paper in victim‚Äôs jacket pocket. Handwriting: unknown. Says only: ""He hears you"".

David skimmed it once, made a mental note, then moved on-too focused on timeline inconsistencies to dwell on it.

It didn‚Äôt mean anything. Probably someone else‚Äôs note. Something misplaced.

He clicked over to the map‚Äîmarked the scene.

Then closed the file for the night.

The room felt heavier somehow.

He didn‚Äôt know it yet, but that torn paper was never meant for Regina.

Chapter 3: He Hears You

Year 2018

It had been quiet for years.

Not peace. Not guilt. Just quiet.

After the girl dead in Dallas the one they called Ashley he stopped. Not out of fear. Not because he felt watched. It just... no longer served a purpose. There was no thrill in routine. He already knew how the story ended.

They never caught him.

They never came close.

The task force was a mess. Faces changed. Files shuffled. Interest died faster than the girls did.

So he faded.

New name. New job. New walls to hide behind.

But even in stillness, he listened.

Sometimes, in motel rooms or long stretches of highway, he‚Äôd scroll through newsfeeds or crime forums. Quiet curiosity. Nothing more. He liked seeing how far they'd drifted from the truth.

But one night, sometime in late 2018, the algorithm offered something new.

A podcast.

Unheard Voices.

The name alone made his jaw twitch.

He didn‚Äôt click right away. He let the title episode sit in his mind like an itch beneath the skin.

That name.

He remembered.

Not her face. Not what she wore. Just her name, caught in the back of his mind like something under a fingernail.

""Cassandra Serna"".

She had been one of the early ones. Before the task force. Before people started to notice.

He hadn't heard her name in years.

He closed his eyes and let the voice continue. It was near perfect recounting, some facts off, some pieces missing‚Äîbut it was enough.

Someone was looking.

Someone was talking about her.

That... hadn‚Äôt happened before.

He felt it behind his ribs not fear, not thrill, just the slow tightening of a thread he thought had unraveled; Something woke up in him.

He went back to his car.

Didn‚Äôt sleep.

By morning, he had a plan.

Her name was Regina McClain.

She wasn‚Äôt important. Not personally. Not like Cassandra. Not like any of them.

But she was near. She was easy.

She would be enough.

He watched her from a distance for three days. She had patterns. She walked alone. Laughed with her phone against her cheek. Ate dinner late. Always tipped well.

The night he followed her, the air was cool. She didn‚Äôt scream.

It was never about chaos.

It was about control.

By dawn, she was gone.

Crime Scene Log ‚Äî Mesquite, TX ‚Äì 2018

""Found torn scrap of paper in victim‚Äôs jacket pocket. Handwriting: unknown. Says only: ‚ÄòHe hears you.‚Äô‚Äù

He folded the note himself. Took his time.

It didn‚Äôt matter who found it.

What mattered was that it had been left.

Not for Regina.

For the voice.

The one speaking for them.

Chapter 4: Paper Voices

Back to 2023

The episode was live.

David leaned back in his chair, his eyes tracking the final upload bar as the Regina McClain case hit the feed. 

The numbers ticked up.

Regina's story weighed on him. There was something unsettling about the silence surrounding her death. Forgotten. Underreported. Almost as if someone wanted it that way.

He had nearly missed her name an accidental find during research. But now, her story was out there. Unheard no more.

He didn‚Äôt stop. The next case folder was already waiting.

Madison Rios ‚Äì 2019

A college senior, art major. Found murdered in a downtown stairwell after a gallery showing. No witnesses. No leads.

David scanned the crime scene details with only half his attention until one line caught him:

‚ÄúTorn sketchbook paper recovered from backpack. Handwritten: ‚ÄòPaint me in silence.‚Äô‚Äù

He blinked.

He copied the quote into his research notes.

""Strange..."" he muttered. It wasn‚Äôt part of the crime report. Not even mentioned by the media. Just... there.

He filed it away and moved on.

Deborah Ann King ‚Äì 2020

A warehouse night worker, 46, lived alone. Found murdered behind an abandoned theater.

David read the report slowly, bleary eyes, black coffee in hand. Then another line stopped him cold:

‚ÄúFolded note found in jacket: ‚ÄòThe Echo That Bled.‚Äô‚Äù

He sat up straighter.

Three cases. Three years. Three victims. Three lines.

He returned to Madison's case and Regina's and read the phrase again:

""He hears you""
""Paint me in silence.""
""The Echo That Bled.""

Unsettling. Poetic. Specific.

He opened a fresh document, labeled it: Found Phrases.

He didn‚Äôt know why yet. It was just a gut feeling.

He‚Äôd been doing this long enough to know when something didn‚Äôt belong. And these... these weren‚Äôt just odd flourishes. They felt intentional. Like someone wanted them seen.

But why?

Jessica Nguyen ‚Äì 2021

Quiet. Well-liked. Taught fourth grade.

She disappeared walking home from school. Her body was later found in a park.

David scrolled through the official report. Then he stopped:

‚ÄúMessage found on store receipt, tucked in her boot: ‚ÄòEchoes don‚Äôt lie.‚Äô‚Äù

David exhaled slowly.

""four"".

four victims. four years. four phrases.

He opened his note document again and added the new line.

A pattern was forming. The only connection? The lines. The tone. There was something deliberate here.

He turned his gaze to the wall of his office. The corkboard. The names, the pins, the timelines. His mother‚Äôs case at the center.

These women weren‚Äôt on that board yet.

Mia Bell ‚Äì 2022

Aspiring musician. Twenty-six. Found outside a venue she never made it into.

The final note:

‚ÄúYour voice woke me.‚Äù

David froze.

His voice.

That wasn‚Äôt coincidence.

It hit harder than the rest‚Äîlike a whisper through a locked door.

The others had felt like cryptic poetry. This one felt... personal.

Still, no context. No explanation. Just a line, buried in a police file no one had bothered to read twice.

David didn‚Äôt know what it meant.

But he knew this wasn‚Äôt over.

He saved the files.

Opened a new folder.

Chapter 5: The One Who Listens

It had been bothering him for days.

David stared at the document open on his desktop: five names, typed in bold.

Regina McClain
Madison Rios
Deborah Ann King
Jessica Nguyen
Mia Bell

He wasn‚Äôt supposed to think they were connected.

Different Counties. Different backgrounds. Different years.

But it wouldn‚Äôt leave him alone.

He leaned back in his chair, eyes flicking between windows‚Äîmaps, timelines, articles, police reports. A familiar symphony was building around him.

It had started as an itch. Now it was a rhythm.

The Method
All shot. All clean. All without signs of robbery or assault. All left somewhere public or remote, but late‚Äîjust late enough to be missed.

The Notes
Each one strange. Almost poetic. Cryptic. Folded. Tucked away.

He reread them now, the words echoing louder in his mind:

""He hears you""
‚ÄúPaint me in silence.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe Echo That Bled.‚Äù
‚ÄúEchoes don‚Äôt lie.‚Äù
‚ÄúYour voice woke me.‚Äù

They weren‚Äôt just odd. They were consistent. A voice trying to be heard but not by the police.

By someone else.

David pressed his palms into his eyes.

""By me? No.."" he whispered.

He pulled up a digital map and dropped pins: Plano. Garland. Denton. Grand Prairie.

Close. Spread just enough to be missed unless you were looking from far enough away.

The kind of distance the Police wouldn't see

He started pulling dates:

Regina McClain : 2018

Madison: 2019

Deborah: 2020

Jessica: 2021

Mia: 2022

One each year.

There it was‚Äîthe rhythm. Precise. Controlled.

Not spontaneous.

Planned.

A killer with patience. With ritual. And now, apparently, with an audience.

He opened his research folder as he remember a phrase in one of the early episodes and found Natasha Lane-1995, one of first cases he‚Äôd covered back in the early days of the podcast.

He skimmed the files. That line. That terrible line.

‚ÄúThe silence is final.‚Äù

A chill ran down his spine.

A Seven phrase?.

The pattern was undeniable. Too tight. Too perfect.

He paused.

The voices. The clues.

This wasn‚Äôt random.

He turned away from the computer screen, his eyes locking onto the wall where his corkboard was pinned with case files; He reached over and grabbed a fresh piece of paper. With a red marker, he began drawing circles around the phrases. He circled the dates. The cities.

The rhythm.

And then the name hit him, sharp and sudden:

""The Whisperer"".

Not because he shouted. Not because he made himself known.

But because of how quiet he was.

How careful.

The Whisperer didn‚Äôt force his way into the world.

He crept into it.

Unseen. Unheard.

Until someone started listening back.

David stared at the name in front of him. ""The Whisperer"".

It felt right. Instinctual. The killer wasn‚Äôt loud. He wasn‚Äôt reckless. He had a pattern, a message, a ritual.

And for the first time in years, David felt like he was close.

But how close? and to what?

His eyes flicked back to his mother‚Äôs case file.

Had this been the same killer all along? Had the pattern existed before these women? Was his mother another name on a growing list?

David couldn‚Äôt be sure.

But one thing was clear: The Whisperer was Speaking.",2,1753928269.0,creepcast,0,1.0,False

To strengthen the worse heroes and archetypes while nerfing the stronger ones, specifically heroes that have been widely considered the best for a prolonged period of time to give a season or two of a fresh meta without just taking them out back and nerfing them to death.

1mdpju8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amtrak/comments/1mdpju8/trip_report_two_adults_and_a_toddler_in_a/,"Trip Report: Two Adults and a Toddler in a Roomette, Coast Starlight, EMY to SEA","They said it would be terrible; they said we would kill each other; they said, oh you, unknown these many years to train travel, what special hell have you invited on yourself? But lo, behold: with good attitudes, solid co-parenting skills, and even in 94Àö, it was awesome!

Left EMY on 7/22; train was delayed almost two hours, but the delay didn't start until about twenty minutes before it was supposed to get to EMY (they were trying to fix the AC at OAK, the station before us), so that was kind of the worst part (I am so bad at waiting, but I am so much better at waiting when I know I have to wait). The night was cool and beautiful, so we hung out in the outer part of EMY, and kiddo slept on my chest. Husband was cool calm and collected; kid snoozed.

When the train did get there, kid woke up, I got excited; wow, trains are huge! And the engine was so new and shiny and did I say HUGE. Our roomette was the in the first car behind the dining car, which was actually really convenient; it was one of those cars with roomettes and sleepers and the family room downstairs. We had a car on the west side of the train, which I was bummed about, but it was almost midnight when we got on, so I didn't feel like asking if maybe we could switch to the East side (for views of Shasta). Which, that turned out to be awesome anyway, because we went to the viewing car for Shasta and met way cool people.

Night went really great - the kid was immediately fascinated with all things train, pushing buttons, flipping switches, etc. It was hard to get her to chill out and go back to sleep. Only scary/bad moment was when my husband and I were both not having a hand on her, and she kind of fell between the edge of the bottom bunk and the door; she was fine, but it was a good early reality check that trains can really jostle, and suddenly, and we needed to be on her the whole time.

For sleeping, kid stuck to the bottom bunk with one adult; one adult slept up top. We're a very snuggly family and cosleep at home anyway, so this worked out great. My husband spent the first half of the night with kid, we switched midway through. I'm 5'2"" and he's 6'3"", but we were both comfortable in both places. I feel like if you're expecting huge amounts of room, you'll be disappointed, but if you're prepared for having a bunk, it's just great.

Come morning, we went to the observation car and had coffee and watched the views of Shasta. I met a really interesting professor of philosophy from Georgetown, and we talked about boredom (he had taken the train to write about boredom, except then he never got bored :) Our breakfast server was suuuuuper cranky, like, the rudest serve I've maybe ever had, but we sat across from a SUPER awesome self-appointed Train Guy (Erin, if you'er out there, hi!), who was our buddy for most of the rest of the trip. He was great, a total Amtrak enthusiast, and told us lots of cool stuff. The breakfast food was kind of meh, but fine.

After breakfast, it was observation car/hangs/running around with the kid until lunch; the scenery in this part of Cali and Oregon is just so stunning. I loved watching the train go by and just... getting to be in parts of the world that aren't as developed as highway travel. It was magical.

We did spend some time in the roomette, and actually keeping it in bed mode was kind of good - it was like she had her own little playpen to bounce around in, and we didn't have to police her behavior around other people. It was small on space, definitely, but that was just sort of... fine with us.

Lunch was great - husband and I split the Caesar and the patty melt. Kid ate off our foods. After lunch, husband napped with kid (we had the attendant who was THE BEST - what's up Lorna, have they fixed the AC yet? - leave the bed in bed mode till the afternoon). After naptime, it was more observation car and various run-arounds until dinnertime. What kept our kid entertained most was a) letting her move, and b) stickers. Lots of stickers. We put stickers on the windows (and took them off again), colored on stickers, gave random people stickers, etc. It was totally great.

I think the biggest challenge was the AC in the afternoon; we still breastfeed, and I was hoping to do that/nap for the second nap of the day in the roomette, and it was just too hot in there (we tried; I was actually worried my kid was getting unhealthily hot, so we left). And, part of why we got the roomette was to just have a lower-stimulus place for the kid to chill, and we couldn't really do that at the end of the ride, when she needed it most. I'm bummed about that part, but other than that, I really, truly did love this ride.

Dinner - I had salmon, husband had steak. I was kind of disappointed in the salmon - it was like, fine, not great. Steak was gooooood.

Got in to Seattle about two hours later than schedule. Least favorite part of the scenery was the endless distribution centers outside of Tacoma; man, is that a depressing thing to see the world coming to.

All in all, 8/10 for the AC, and otherwise, we wanna do it again in a year or two.

I have endometriosis and chronic atypical migraines that get aggravated by lack of sleep so for damn near the last four years, I've been fending off a fucking migraine or a damn endo flare up. Ive tried co-sleeping which works for them but not for me because somehow, even in a king sized bed, they find a way to sleep right on top of me.

We move them into their own room. We bought fucking Purple mattresses for them because it's what we have. I have black out curtains, a sound machine, this stupid fucking astronaut that projects the galaxy as a night light, it has a fan and the room stays in the mid 60s since they hate being hot. They still won't sleep. It's anywhere from thirty minutes to TWO FUCKING HOURS to get them to sleep. Morning, nap time and bed time are the same every single night. Its the same routine. I finally fight them to bed and someone's up no less than 20 fucking minutes later and then, its up the stairs, down the stairs all fucking night long until I inevitably give in and either sleep on tbe floor of their room OR bring them to mine.

""We're not facing the worst-case scenario,"" Brazilian Treasury Secretary Rogerio Ceron told reporters.

Trump's executive order formalizing a 50% tariff excluded dozens of key Brazilian exports to the United States, including civil aircraft, pig iron, precious metals, wood pulp, energy and fertilizers.

[...] IMPACT SMALLER THAN EXPECTED

The effective tariff rate on Brazilian shipments to the U.S. should be around 30.8%, lower than previously expected due to the exemptions, according to Goldman.

Oil shipments to the U.S., which had been suspended, are set to restart after being spared, lobby group IBP said. Meanwhile, mining lobby Ibram said the exemptions covered 75% of mining exports.

However, it was still too soon to celebrate, said former Brazilian trade secretary Welber Barral, estimating that Brazil exports some 3,000 different products to the United States.

""There will be an impact,"" Barral said.

Let‚Äôs face it‚Äîtyping out a long Bitcoin address by hand is about as fun as solving a Rubik‚Äôs Cube underwater while blindfolded. Between the 1s, 3s, uppercase letters, and total lack of mercy for typos, there‚Äôs a reason most people prefer to scan and go. That‚Äôs where we come in: [**Bitcoin QR Code Maker API**](https://www.bitcoinqrcodemaker.com/bitcoin-qr-code-maker-api-and-widgets/) to the rescue!

I 14m have struggled with insomnia for awhile, since I was about 10. I mostly got over it, with occasional nights where I couldn‚Äôt sleep at all. But I‚Äôve recently been spending my nights this summer awake for a really long time, and using caffeine to keep me awake. I generally find it fun to be awake for long times, but coming down from it, that‚Äôs another story. Right now, I‚Äôve been awake for about 31 hours. I drank coffee with ~175mg of caffeine in it about 4.5 hours ago. I usually limit myself to 30 hrs, and after that, I get really bad anxiety like I used to with my insomnia. I‚Äôm going to back to school soon, so this habit won‚Äôt be perpetuating, and it‚Äôs not always every night. It‚Äôs like maybe 1/3 of the week. My only worry though is would staying up for 40 hours or something until the caffeine wears off be absolutely harmful? It‚Äôs also good to mention that after these nights, I usually sleep abt 12-16 hours. 

Another section of this (my thoughts are very sporadic right now and I can‚Äôt organize them at all) 
I‚Äôm finding it easier to sleep at day then it is at night. I don‚Äôt know why but when it‚Äôs night time and I have to sleep, a lot of the time I‚Äôm left with a feeling of anxiety. And then I lay there in bed waiting patiently to fall asleep. I start to subconsciously run simulations in my head of playing a video game, and I guess winning said game starts to equal actual sleep to my half asleep mind, but I really never sleep even though I‚Äôm not in control of my thoughts if it makes sense. That‚Äôs just an element to it. I‚Äôve already battled ‚Äúinsomnia‚Äù in the past, where I still got like 4-5 hours of sleep a night, but leading to that was absolute chaos in my mind. I‚Äôve tried all the tricks and what not and they don‚Äôt really work. Like I think there were two ways to deal with it and they were something like act I and act ii if I‚Äôm not mistaken, I forgot the exact name. I‚Äôm aware of the damage I‚Äôve already done to my circadian rhythm and insomnia issues by staying up long like this. It‚Äôs probably going to affect me into the school year but oh well I‚Äôll figure it out eventually. Im probably going to write some long update in the comments too because as I said, my thoughts are everywhere and completely disorganized right now.",1,1753927774.0,sleep,1,1.0,False

Time after time they list ‚Äúoh do you want an expresso shot, oh do you want a hash brown, oh do you want ____‚Äù. It‚Äôs honestly so friggin annoying.

But when you get to the window they pretty much throw your order at you through your car window rushing you out. The worst part is, half the time the order is wrong anyways even after all that dilly dallying. So what I have started doing it making my order and saying ‚Äúno if I wanted that I would have ordered that‚Äù.

I‚Äôve been into cacti for about a year and a half now. It started with a very sad-looking Mammillaria I rescued from a clearance shelf. It was soft in all the wrong places and clearly overwatered, but I was like, ‚Äúyeah I can save this.‚Äù (I could not. RIP.)

Since then I‚Äôve slowly built up a little gang. A stubborn Astrophytum that refuses to grow, a Gymnocalycium that‚Äôs actually thriving somehow, and a Euphorbia I thought was a cactus for longer than I‚Äôd like to admit. Also managed to sunburn a couple Echinopsis because I got too excited about full sun. Learning.

Not an expert at all, just someone who‚Äôs made enough dumb mistakes to have accidentally learned a few things. Posting in case anyone else is in that weird early phase where you‚Äôre kind of winging it and hoping for the best.

# Stuff that‚Äôs helped me not kill (as many) plants:

* **Ignore them more** Like, actually. I used to constantly check on them and mess with the soil and rotate them for ‚Äúeven growth‚Äù (lol). Now I basically just let them do their thing unless something looks seriously off.
* **Water way less than feels natural** If you‚Äôre wondering if it‚Äôs time to water‚Ä¶ it probably isn‚Äôt. I wait until the soil is bone dry and then wait like 2 more days. My plants are way happier for it. Also I stopped trusting those moisture meters, they lied to me.
* **Sunlight is not optional** I used to think a bright windowsill was fine. It‚Äôs not. Cacti need real sun. I started moving mine outside during the warmer months and it made a huge difference. Just be careful or they will crisp up like bacon if you don‚Äôt ease them into it.
* **Better soil led to better plants** The store-bought ‚Äúcactus mix‚Äù is basically mulch and sadness. I started mixing my own, mostly pumice, perlite, a bit of soil, and it‚Äôs helped a lot with drainage and root health. Less rot, more growth.
* **Plant apps to stop me guessing** I‚Äôve been using a mix of apps to keep track of basic stuff like watering, repotting dates, fertiliser, and light levels. Definitely helped me realise patterns, like how long after repotting they sulk for etc or when growth has been happening.  Most recent one's [Pipify](https://www.viralreach.org/apps/pipify?source=R_c), nothing fancy but have found it to have more accurate ID's and health scans than others, I'd say the UI on ones like Planta and other apps are a bit better though. As with anything always double check with forums /sub-reddits like this one.

# Stuff I absolutely got wrong:

* **Repotted too soon** Used to immediately repot anything new ‚Äújust in case.‚Äù Killed a couple doing that. Now I leave them alone for a while unless something is clearly off.
* **Didn‚Äôt respect dormancy** First winter, I kept watering because they ‚Äúlooked thirsty.‚Äù Big mistake. A few went mushy. Now I barely water at all from like October to March.
* **Too many too fast** I got a little too excited and suddenly had 15 different species with different needs. It got overwhelming real quick. I‚Äôm trying to chill now and just focus on the ones I actually understand.
* **Trusted care tags** Spoiler: ‚Äúbright indirect light‚Äù is not a real thing for most cacti. Those tags are lying. Reddit and actual growers are way more helpful than whatever the garden center says.

# What‚Äôs kept me into it:

Honestly, it‚Äôs kind of meditative now. I check on them while making coffee, maybe brush off some dust, admire a new spine, and that‚Äôs it. No pressure to do anything. Just nice, slow progress.

Anyway, if you‚Äôre new to all this, don‚Äôt worry about having the perfect setup or the rarest species. Just try to keep them alive, learn what works for your space, and accept that you‚Äôre probably gonna kill one or two along the way. It happens.

And I know not everyone may have the luxury we did, but I will say that if a relative or friend (even a distant one!) can be found who works in the field, it is so comforting to know that your child is in the hands of someone who cares and not complete strangers. 
-My sister-in-law dropped off a giant bag of groceries such as frozen pizzas, hamburger buns, eggs from her chickens, and some homemade bread. That was incredibly helpful.
-Various people sent checks or cash. I don‚Äôt care what anybody says, money IS important and the last thing you want to have to worry about is financial strain when you are going through heartbreak. 
-My husband‚Äôs aunt and cousins sent something called a ‚Äúhug in a box‚Äù which basically was like a sympathy care package that included a beautiful throw blanket, cozy socks, a candle, a coffee mug, etc. I‚Äôm guessing they have a website where you can order things. My cousin also sent some similar things including another beautiful coffee mug and candle (she also venmoed money). While the care package thing is a bit less practical, it is still nice to have some comforting self-care items that you can look forward to using. 
-Postpartum products for mothers to whom they can be useful. Going through postpartum recovery with no baby to show for it is brutal. Her milk will still come in, she will be bleeding what feels like buckets every day, and most likely has a tear or even is recovering from major surgery. Fortunately, the hospital sends you home with a ton of stuff, but the foams and sprays such as those from Frida and Lansinoh are helpful, and adult diapers are a lifesaver. 
-On that note, treating grieving parents of babies like actual parents. Just because we aren‚Äôt changing diapers, feeding, and caring for our little ones like others does not make us less of parents. We are still mommies and daddies and we want to be recognized as parents and we want our children to be called by name and remembered instead of covered up like some morbid mystery. Also, if applicable, let a mama know that you are willing to hear her birth story. Even though the outcome was so sad, I had a birth experience that I would like to tell others about, but I am afraid that it will sound too morbid to others given that my daughter wasn‚Äôt alive‚Ä¶ my cousin asked me to tell her about my birth during our first phone call, and while this may not be appropriate for everybody, it definitely meant a lot to me.
These are the major things that come to my mind, but I hope we can start a discussion and others can also mention things that are/were helpful to them ‚ù§Ô∏è And to all those who are trying to do what they can to help, thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è ",4,1753927244.0,babyloss,0,0.84,False

No living children. My husband and I were able to do the recurrent pregnancy loss testing and sperm analysis and everything is fine. We decided to try again right after my last miscarriage, without waiting for a period in between. We got pregnant and are trying to be optimistic but it's just so hard after the losses.

I decided to get my betas done this time so I'd know right off the bat where things are heading. 

12DPO - HCG: 119  
14DPO - HCG: 375 (results from today)

I woke up to light brown spotting this morning. A little on my underwear and then a bit when I wiped. I was sure I was going to have a chemical and that my beta would either be super slow rising or dropping so when we got the 375 results, we were ecstatic.

The spotting has continued and it's looking more like coffee grounds now. It's only when I wipe though.

This is how my last miscarriage started so I'm just exhausted of this whole process. I know brown blood means it's old blood so it could be nothing but I'm still feeling a little defeated. My OB will call me in the morning so I'll tell him about the blood but right now I'm just looking for positive stories of good betas and early spotting/bleeding.",2,1753927243.0,CautiousBB,1,1.0,False

I wish corrupt cop blackmails the fmc was a trope. She either is forced into a dangerous relationship with like a mob boss or with the corrupt cop. There‚Äôs loads of potential. 


I also love it when the mmc finds out about the fmc‚Äôs interest in dark romance or bodice rippers and gets excited that she might be into filthy stuff she‚Äôs not ready to admit to yet.

If more authors wanted to have the mmc push romances on the fmc that encouraged their dynamic , well, that is a trope I could get behind.


And lastly (for now), I love a good butthurt mmc. Maybe she hurt his feelings intentionally or unintentionally (think Nesta and Cassian in ACOTAR by Sarah J Maas).

It‚Äôs an amazing country, but as per the western world, it‚Äôs considered one of the poorer countries, so the service class would be making less wages as well.

Booked an Uber from the Airport to the hotel at 3 AM. Paid the set cost, the ride took an hour, the driver was courteous, made sure our comfort was met. At the end of the ride, offered him Rs. 200 (less than $3), his first response was ‚ÄúNo, you have already paid for the ride‚Äù. He refused several times after, but this sweet behavior intrigued us. We insisted and his eyes lit up. 

Now we reached the hotel. The bell hop took our luggage upstairs. Offered him Rs. 100 ($1.5), surprisingly he also refused. He said it‚Äôs his job and to let him know if we need anything. At the end of the stay, we gave him a box of American chocolates. His happiness made our day.

At the hotel itself (Marriott, US brand), there was a breakfast buffet. I was confused seeing so many servers for a buffet. These servers were so friendly, greeted us, seated us. Water was filled and a bottle was kept. Despite that, whenever the glass was empty, they instantly filled it. The food was a buffet style, but they still ask you if you want anything and bring it to you with the right condiments. They bring it hot and fresh from the kitchen if a new batch is made. Same with tea/coffee/omelettes, you just tell them what you want and they bring it to you despite having the ability to just go and pick it up. They serve in the plate, refill unlimitedly and always are polite and sweet.
All this with no tips.

Now tell me, here in the US, where you have to flag down a server so many times just to get a glass of water, and there is already an absurd inflation with food costs, and yet we are expected to tip a high percentage despite the service not being good. When we try to tip less, there is a cry of servers not making living wages, etc. 

I want to know the comments of these entitled servers on the condition of these supposedly poorer country service workers with even poorer wages giving stellar service and refusing tips.

## Key features Analysis

The best‚Å£ mug rugs of 2025 offer a blend of functionality, aesthetics, and quality. Different materials, sizes, ‚Äçand construction methods contribute‚Å£ to the overall performance and durability of these handy accessories.

**Material:** The material‚Äå used in a mug rug substantially ‚Äãaffects its absorbency, durability, and overall aesthetic.Popular choices ‚Å¢include cotton, wool ‚Äçfelt, cork, and even quilted fabric. Cotton‚Å¢ offers good absorbency and is easy to clean,while wool felt provides excellent ‚Äãheat ‚Äãresistance and a soft texture.‚Å£ Cork is naturally water-resistant and adds a modern touch.Quilted fabrics often offer a combination of absorbency and insulation due to varying densities. High-quality construction and durable threads can make all the difference. ‚ÄçThe fabric must be robust ‚Å¢enough to withstand daily use and potential stains.

**Size and Shape:** Mug rugs typically range in size‚Äç from 4 inches to 8 inches in diameter or width. The ideal size depends on the size of your mugs‚Å§ and the amount of ‚Äçsurface area you want ‚Äãto protect. Consider the shape as well; round, square, rectangular, and even uniquely shaped mug rugs are available.A larger mug rug will catch more drips and spills, while a smaller one may be more visually‚Å¢ discreet. Choosing a shape that ‚Å§complements your mugs and decor will further ‚Äçenhance the‚Äã overall‚Å¢ aesthetic.

**Absorbency:**‚Å§ A crucial feature of‚Äç any good mug rug is its ability to‚Å£ absorb moisture effectively. Look for materials like‚Äã cotton or absorbent ‚Å§felt, or mug rugs with multiple layers to increase absorbency. Some ‚Äãmug rugs incorporate a waterproof ‚Äçbacking ‚Å£to prevent moisture from seeping through to ‚Å§the surface underneath. Consider‚Å¢ the potential for condensation and spills when evaluating absorbency. A ‚Äãhighly absorbent mug rug‚Å¢ minimizes mess and protects your furniture.

**Heat Resistance:** While not all mug rugs‚Äã are ‚Äçdesigned to withstand extreme heat, ‚Å§some offer a degree of heat‚Äã resistance. ‚ÄçWool felt and cork are naturally heat-resistant, making them suitable for use with hot beverages. Quilted mug rugs can also‚Äã provide some insulation. Check the product‚Å§ specifications to‚Äå determine the maximum temperature the mug rug can handle. If you frequently use very hot drinks, prioritizing heat resistance is essential.

**Design and Aesthetics:** ‚ÄãMug rugs ‚Å§come in a vast array of designs, from simple and understated to elaborate and decorative. You can find mug rugs to match any‚Äç decor style, from minimalist to bohemian. Consider the colors, patterns, and textures that will complement your existing furnishings.‚Å§ Some mug rugs feature intricate embroidery, appliques, or other embellishments. Choosing a design that reflects your personality and‚Å¢ style will add a personal touch to your ‚Å¢space.

**Ease of Cleaning:** Spills are inevitable, so consider how easy a mug ‚Å¢rug is to clean. Cotton mug rugs can often be machine-washed, while wool felt may require hand-washing. Cork mug rugs ‚Å¢can typically‚Äã be wiped clean with a‚Äç damp cloth. Look for materials that are stain-resistant or easy to spot-clean. Regular cleaning will help keep your mug rugs looking their best and prevent build-up of stains and odors.

Is there a way out?,"I want to say I've had this problem for about 2 years, given the series of events and how my quality of life has changed, etc. But I was only officially diagnosed this March when I had a bad attack of diverticulitis that required my to call 911 and be rushed to the hospital.

I work on my recovery from then until June. June is also when I underwent a colonoscopy. Now, here is the interesting part. She was very confident and oddly adamant that taking psyllium/Metamucil was the only solution.

""But what if I'm still blocked up?""

""No! Metamucil. Your only way out. You'll definitely get another flare-up without it.""

So, for a little while there, I did what she said. The problem was, my hunch was correct and it did make my depositing problem that much worse.

So, then I thought: I better get a second opinion because this is pretty bad. My doctor, who has always been very complacent, apathetic, and lazy simply refuses to give me another referral. He is so sure that there is nothing more that can be done for me. But every time I experience agonizing constipation that only maybe gets solved with laxitives and coffee, and that's maybe. I can't help but think, ""There has to be something. Life can't just be this for me now.""

And I do understand that the Internet is a very opinionated venue and that anyone can espouse their perception of reality onto it, but I see a lot of positive entries on here and elsewhere pointing to undergoing colon surgery to rid myself of the diverticula in my body. The other thing is, I already knew that getting another flare-up is pretty easy, but recently I saw that it increases my risk of getting colon cancer. And I don't need that at an older age.

That's another thing he said when I say all of this. Well, if you get diverticulitis again, just ask me for antibiotics. And the thing is, the antibiotics do work! And I'm able to have regular bathroom activity more often as I take them. But you don't just get them willy-nilly either and there's probably a reason for that.

It boils down to this, folks. Do I go the extra mile to see if I have any recourse whatsoever to at least inquire about colon surgery to some specialist out there or am I just my doctor's puppet and he controls my destiny and that's the end of it?

I actually love when this happens if it is for the right reasons.  Helping others has always been one of my core values and is actually one of the things that has drawn me to be a SD.

SGF reached out last night stating that there was something going on with someone in her inner circle that would be a great opportunity for us to help.  I could tell she was excited about it and told her that I looked forward to connecting more about it in the morning.

Over breakfast and coffee at her house, she told me what was up.  A group of her friends were looking to help someone they know get back on her feet and set up in a new living situation.  There was list of things that were needed and SGF was really hopeful that we could step up and help.  I could tell that this was really important to her and I knew this was my time to shine.  SGF knows me well and she knew I would be totally down for it.  So much so, she hinted that she ‚Äúmay‚Äù have told others that we were in.  lol‚Ä¶ The look in SGF eyes when we agreed to what we would do and that she could head out with her ‚ÄúSB credit card‚Äù in hand and handle it on her own made her day and thus made my day!!!  We were both so excited to help!!!  

Full disclosure‚Ä¶. She has a card with her name as an authorized user on my account.  One of the best things I have done for her.  Huge lift to her credit score!!!

And not to my surprise, she was VERY turned on by all of this and definitely made sure I was well taken care of before it was time for me to head into the office for the day.  :) #bonuspoints

Those that treat others well and lift up those around them, are often rewarded by being treated equally as well or better.

## Key Features Analysis

The best walker trays are designed with several critical features that enhance their functionality, safety, and user-friendliness. These features often determine how well a tray performs in daily use and how much burden it reduces for the user.

**Secure Attachment mechanism:**

A Reliable attachment system is crucial for a walker tray‚Äôs stability and safety. Many trays utilize a clip-on design that securely fastens to the walker's frame. The best models feature adjustable clips to accommodate different walker widths and frame shapes. Look for trays with locking mechanisms or sturdy latches that prevent accidental detachment during use. some premium trays even offer tool-free installation, making them easy to attach and remove as needed. This secure attachment ensures that the tray remains stable,preventing spills and accidents,and allows the user to confidently move around.

**Durable and lightweight Material:**

The Material used in a walker tray‚Äôs construction considerably impacts its longevity and ease of use. Most high-quality trays are made from durable plastics like polypropylene or ABS, which offer a good balance of strength and weight. Lightweight materials are essential to minimize the added burden on the user,especially those with limited strength or endurance. A sturdy material ensures that the tray can withstand daily wear and tear, including carrying heavier items without bending or breaking. Some models may also feature a non-slip surface to prevent items from sliding around during movement.

**Raised Edges and Spill-Proof Design:**

To prevent spills and keep items securely on the tray, raised edges are a must-have feature. These edges typically stand about one to two inches high, providing a barrier that contains liquids and prevents small objects from rolling off. The best designs incorporate rounded corners and smooth surfaces that are easy to clean. A spill-proof design might also include a slight inward slope towards the center of the tray, directing any spills away from the edges and minimizing the mess. This feature is particularly important for individuals who use their walker trays to carry meals or beverages.

**Ample Surface Area:**

The Size of the walker tray‚Äôs surface area determines how much it can hold and determines its usefulness in various situations. Look for trays that provide enough space to accommodate a plate of food, a drink, and other small essentials like a phone or glasses. The ideal size will vary depending on individual needs and preferences, but generally, a tray with dimensions of at least 12 inches by 16 inches offers a good balance of capacity and maneuverability.Some trays also feature divided compartments or recessed areas to further organize items and prevent them from shifting during transport.**Easy Cleaning and Maintenance:**

A Walker tray that is easy to clean is essential for hygiene and convenience. Smooth, non-porous surfaces are ideal, as they resist stains and can be quickly wiped down with a damp cloth. Some trays are even dishwasher-safe, providing an even easier cleaning option. Avoid trays with intricate patterns or crevices that can trap dirt and bacteria. Look for trays made from materials that are resistant to odors and stains. Regularly cleaning the walker tray helps to maintain its appearance and prevent the spread of germs.

Key features of the best walker trays include:

* Secure attachment mechanisms
* Durable and lightweight materials
* Raised edges and spill-proof design
* Ample surface area
* Easy cleaning and maintenance

## Core Benefits

Walker trays provide numerous benefits that significantly enhance the mobility and independence of walker users. These benefits extend beyond simply carrying items, improving the overall quality of life and providing increased confidence.**Enhanced Independence:**

A Walker tray empowers individuals to perform daily tasks independently. Rather of relying on others to carry meals, drinks, or personal belongings, users can manage these tasks themselves. This newfound independence can significantly boost self-esteem and reduce feelings of frustration. It allows users to participate more fully in social activities, such as enjoying meals with family or friends, without needing constant assistance. The ability to move around independently contributes to a greater sense of control over one‚Äôs life.**Improved Safety:**

Carrying items while using a walker can be hazardous, increasing the risk of falls and injuries. A walker tray eliminates this risk by providing a stable and secure platform for transporting items. This frees up the user's hands to focus on maintaining balance and navigating obstacles. Reduced burden and distraction lead to increased stability and a lower likelihood of accidents. The raised edges of the tray also prevent items from rolling off,further minimizing potential hazards.

**Convenience and Efficiency:**

A Walker tray adds a significant degree of convenience to everyday life. It allows users to carry everything they need in one trip, eliminating the need to make multiple trips back and forth.This efficiency saves time and energy, making daily tasks less strenuous. Whether it‚Äôs carrying a cup of coffee to the living room or bringing medications to the bedroom,a walker tray simplifies the process and reduces the physical strain. This increased convenience promotes greater activity and engagement in daily routines.

**institution and Accessibility:**

many walker trays come with built-in compartments or dividers that help users organize their belongings.this makes it easy to keep essential items within reach, such as phones, glasses, or remote controls. The designated spaces prevent items from getting lost or mixed up, reducing frustration and promoting a more organized lifestyle. This feature is particularly beneficial for individuals with cognitive impairments or limited dexterity, who may have difficulty locating items in a cluttered environment.

## FAQs section

**Are all walker trays universally compatible with all walker models?**
While many walker trays are designed to be compatible with a wide range of standard walker models, it‚Äôs not always a guarantee. Some walkers have unconventional frame designs or unique features that may prevent a universal tray from fitting properly. Always measure the width of your walker‚Äôs frame and compare it to the tray's specified compatibility range before making a purchase. Adjustable straps, clips, or other mechanisms on the tray can often accommodate slight variations in walker design, but it is best to confirm compatibility with the manufacturer or seller.

**How much additional weight can a typical walker tray safely support?**
The weight capacity of a walker tray varies depending on the materials used and its overall construction.Most high-quality walker trays are designed to safely support between 5 to 10 pounds.Exceeding this weight limit can compromise the tray‚Äôs stability and perhaps damage the walker frame. Always check the manufacturer's specifications to determine the tray‚Äôs maximum weight capacity and avoid overloading it with heavy items. Distributing the weight evenly across the tray‚Äôs surface can also help to maintain its balance and prevent tipping.

**Can a walker tray be easily removed when not needed?**
The ease of removing a walker tray depends on its attachment mechanism. Many modern walker trays feature tool-free designs that allow for swift and effortless attachment and removal. These trays typically use clip-on systems or adjustable straps that can be easily released without requiring any special tools. Other models may require a screwdriver or wrench to detach, which can be less convenient for frequent removal. If you anticipate removing the tray frequently enough, look for models with simple and quick-release mechanisms for maximum convenience.

1mdov8b,https://youtube.com/watch?v=u7vnfBF1Udo&si=ZV2wqNIz59CFrwaM,An unusual Hawaii sunset cruise turns into an evening at sea under windy...,"From an unusual (solitary) sunset cruise to an unplanned evening at sea. I haven't seen so many boats out EVER! An 8.8 earthquake off Russia's SE peninsula caused tsunami warnings all around the Pacific Rim and the Hawaiian islands.

Let me say, there is nothing more chilling than hearing wailing WW11-type sirens ringing out. The first of those sirens happened as my afternoon charter and I were motoring down the channel on our way back to the slip. I could tell it un-nerved my charterers too.

So, I dropped them off at the dock, called my sunset cruisers to cancel their charter, took my car to higher ground (a multi-level parking structure close to the harbour) and left again; this time alone...hence ""a very unusual sunset cruise""

At 3 miles out, ocean conditions were cold, windy, LUMPY, BUMPY, GRUMPY. I popped a little headsail and sailed slowly back and forth, eagle-eyed to keep an eye on others doing the same, with one ear on my handheld VHF radio monitoring updates, the other on my cell phone for incoming useful texts. Officially, we were under a tsunami warning, waiting to hear it be dropped to an advisory so we could all safely head back in to the harbour. It took what seemed like forever, but it could have been so much worse. Hawaii had very little damage and I was safely tied back up at the dock by 12:45 am. I thought I'd be sleeping on Kaikiwi for the night but, believe it or not, despite being bone-tired, I was kinda wired... not to mention there is no coffee on board! That I could not tolerate. I must take care of that immediately.¬†

I drove home with the top down, the crescent moon setting behind me, more but a pleasant wind keeping me awake. There was hardly a car on the road. Such a contrast from the stuck traffic, moving an inch a minute, when I moved my car to higher ground.

Mahalo to all who reached out to me last night to let me know the news and details that were so sorely missed on channel 16, monitored by the US Coast Guard. At midnight USCG were still saying "" a tsunami warning has been issued for the Hawaiian Islands. The first wave is expected at 7:17pm...."" thats enough to drive a girl crazy. I learnt more from the guys who were using channel 16 (illegally) to chat with each other, despite the reprimands from the coasties. LOL.

All is well in paradise. We dodged a bullet this time but it reminds us how vulnerable we are. We may not be so lucky next time. Oahu needs to have a better plan to get people to higher ground faster and with less chaos. They must handle this. And I must handle all I am capable of at my end.

1mdouny,https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingplanning/comments/1mdouny/gap_in_wedding_day_timeline_advice/,Gap in wedding day timeline advice,"Hi everyone! 
I'm getting married next October and I'm starting to mull over my timeline. We have the venue booked all day (8am-10pm), so 'm considering an intimate ceremony of 30ish people in the morning, a nice luncheon, games, and then dancing and reception later in the day with a bigger crowd of about 100 people.
Here's my rough estimate so far:

7:00am- Hair and Makeup at home
8am- arrive at the venue, get dressed, start setting up
9:00am- first look, some formals
10:00am- guests arrive
10:15am- ceremony starts
10:45am- family pictures, coffee social
11:30am- Bar opens, drinks served
12:00pm- Lunch is served, toasts
1:15pm- assorted lawn/card games

2:00-5:30pm: Here's my gap that I don't know what to do with. 

Reception starts at 6 with cake cutting and first dances, and then party until the end of the night!

Should I just have a break in between? About half of the ceremony guests live in the area so they could go home and change out of their formal clothes, the other half might not have anything to do during the break. 

Or should I just start the reception earlier? I want people to have the chance to eat dinner on their own since I don't have the budget for 100 meals. I'm planning on having light refreshments and drinks available all day to keep people satiated. 

If you had a split wedding day like this with a smaller morning ceremony, I would love to hear how you planned out your timeline!

But if you're open to retiring abroad, you‚Äôll find that your money can go much further, especially across parts of Southeast Asia.

According to a recent report from **International Living**, several destinations in Asia offer retirees a high quality of life, rich culture, warm climates, and modern amenities‚Äîall for **less than $1,500 per month**. We‚Äôve added the Philippines to this list, which continues to attract thousands of foreign retirees with its English-speaking communities, affordable healthcare, and island lifestyle.

Here are **some of the best places in Asia to retire on a modest budget**:

# Dumaguete, Philippines

Known as the ""City of Gentle People,"" Dumaguete is a charming coastal city with a large expat community. It offers a relaxed lifestyle, reliable internet, modern hospitals like Silliman Medical Center, and proximity to diving spots and tropical islands.

* **Rent**: \~$300/month for a modern 1‚Äì2 bedroom apartment
* **Dining**: Local meals under $3, Western options from $5‚Äì$10
* **Monthly costs for a single person**: \~$900‚Äì$1,100
* **Bonus**: The **SRRV visa** allows retirees 50+ to stay long-term with minimal requirements.

# Penang, Malaysia

Penang offers a vibrant blend of colonial charm, modern infrastructure, and one of the best healthcare systems in Asia. It‚Äôs popular with retirees from Europe and North America thanks to its low cost of living and strong expat support networks.

* **Rent**: \~$380/month for a 3-bedroom apartment near the city
* **Dining**: $3 for a coffee, $15 for a 3-course meal for two
* **Monthly costs (excluding rent)**: \~$500‚Äì$1,000 depending on lifestyle

# Chiang Mai, Thailand

This northern Thai city is peaceful, full of culture, and extremely affordable. With hundreds of Buddhist temples, mountain views, and endless street food, it‚Äôs one of the most popular expat hubs in Asia.

* **Rent**: \~$300/month for a modern condo
* **Dining**: Coffee for under $1, dinner for two around $10
* **Monthly total for a couple**: \~$600‚Äì$1,000

# Phnom Penh, Cambodia

Cambodia‚Äôs capital city offers an eclectic mix of history, French-influenced architecture, and some of the easiest long-term visa rules in Asia. While luxury apartments may hit $1,000/month, many retirees live comfortably for far less.

* **Rent**: \~$400‚Äì$600 for a spacious apartment in good areas
* **Dining**: $0.75 beers, fine dining around $40 for two
* **Monthly essentials**: $300‚Äì$500 if shopping and eating locally

# Kuching, Malaysia

Tucked away in Borneo, Kuching is a lesser-known gem. It‚Äôs known for its friendly locals, riverside walkways, and weekend markets. Healthcare is solid and costs are among the lowest in Malaysia.

* **Rent**: \~$700/month for a 3-bedroom home
* **Dining**: Coffee for $0.60, meals $2‚Äì$5
* **Monthly expenses for a couple**: \~$500‚Äì$800 beyond rent

# Hoi An, Vietnam

A beautifully preserved town on Vietnam‚Äôs central coast, Hoi An boasts a blend of beaches, culture, and cheap living. The car-free Old Town and strong caf√© scene are a big draw.

* **Rent**: $250‚Äì$500/month depending on location
* **Dining**: Street food from $1, full meals for $4‚Äì$8
* **Monthly living costs**: $700‚Äì$1,000 for most expats

**Pro Tip**: Most of these destinations offer **long-stay visas or retirement visa programs**, affordable private healthcare, and large expat communities. For retirees seeking peace of mind and a fulfilling lifestyle, the **Philippines**, **Malaysia**, and **Thailand** offer the best balance of cost, comfort, and convenience.",1,1753926179.0,globalinvestorelite,0,1.0,False

1mdotkh,https://www.reddit.com/r/VisitingIceland/comments/1mdotkh/detailed_trip_report_with_budget_and_tips/,Detailed Trip Report with Budget and Tips,"**Intro:** My wife and I just got back from six full days, with a bit of a seventh, in Iceland. I would say 95% of my research came from this sub, so I'm looking to share our experience in the hopes that it can help others. For starters, our goals were to experience the natural beauty of the country, hike, live the van life and camp, learn about and experience Icelandic culture, and do so on a reasonable budget. 

We went through many iterations of an itinerary, initially planning on doing the entire Ring Road, then adjusting for the Reykjavik, the Golden Circle, and the southern coast. The itinerary was changed multiple times while in Iceland. Here is what we ended up doing.

**Day 1:** Our flight landed around 4am in Iceland. We slept a bit at the airport, took a FlyBus to BSI, then caught a cab to Cozy Campers (more on them later) to pick up our camper van and get some groceries. From there we were off.

* Reykjavik. Walked the old city, grabbed some groceries, saw Hallgrimskirkja, grabbed a hot dog at B√¶jarins Beztu Pylsur, and then took off. 
* Thingvellir National Park. Started with a short nap in the van. It had a great visitors center and lots of hiking/walking trails around the park. So much to see. 
* Laugarvatn Sundlaug. We opted out of a soak at Laugarvatn Fontana because of the price and because the rye bread tours were done for the day. Instead we went to the sundlaug (public outdoor pool with hot tubs, cold tub, and steam room) literally right next door for a fraction of the price. Oh man was that worth it. 
* Camping at Uthlid Campsites. Nice campsites with a view of the countryside and solid amenities. Great for our first night.

**Day 2:** This was a packed day, which was the plan overall. Take advantage of the daylight hours and do as much as possible. Not necessarily cover as much ground/distance as possible, but take sights in, go for long hikes, etc. 

* Bruarfoss hike. A 7km out-and-back hike ending at Bruarfoss and also seeing two other waterfalls along the way. For us, the choice between  free parking in a small lot at the start of the hike vs. paid parking and driving straight to the end of the hike was a no brainer.
* Geysir Hot Spring Area. We walked the park for a couple of hours, seeing Strokkur erupt multiple times. The hike up to the top of the park is worth it for sure. Another great visitors center here as well. 
* Gullfoss. To be honest this one felt super touristy. We waded through hordes of people wielding selfie sticks along the walk. Not the end of the world but it definitely was the first time on the trip we felt the ""touristy"" vibes people have talked about on this sub. Again, no big deal but noteworthy. The waterfall itself was incredible as well. 
* Br√∫arhl√∂√∞. Stopped here for a quick hike and views of the river and rock formations. We were surprised that this spot was paid parking but I would say it was worth the stop. 
* Secret Lagoon. Of the three lagoons (Blue, Sky, and Secret), this is for sure the cheapest. Big geothermal pool, hot tubs, and a cold tub. Another relaxing soak. 
* Camping at Arhus Campsites in Hella. Beautiful campground beside a river with a great common area for cooking and relaxing.

**Day 3:** Another big day!

* Quick snack at the American School Bus Cafe. Cool vibe inside and cool idea. Overpriced and underwhelming cinnamon bun. 
* Seljalandsfoss. We wound up driving to the parking lot, seeing that it was another paid parking situation, viewing the waterfall from a distance, then leaving. I was still impressed by the size and sight but didn't feel the need to pay and see it up close. 
* Midskalagil Canyon. This was a completely impromptu stop that I only found by zooming in on Google Maps and seeing what was in the area. But man was it awesome. It was an amazing hike on the rim of a canyon with some waterfalls along the way. We parked in a small lot by a nearby church. The cool thing about Iceland is the random spots you find or stumble upon can sometimes be the highlight of the day or trip.
* Skogafoss. Amazing stop. Do the hike and keep going past the falls. It turns into a 30km, multi day hike so you can go as long as you want. We hiked for a few hours total. Such a cool landscape to explore.
* Loftsalahellir Cave. Another stop we stumbled upon. Very cool cave to explore quickly.
* Dyrh√≥laey Lighthouse. Stopped to see the puffins and explore the area. Another unreal and beautiful stop. 
* Reynisfjara Beach and Reynisdrangar Cliffs. Definitely the geological highlight of the trip. The basalt columns juxtaposed with the black sand beach was something special.
* Smi√∞jan Bruggh√∫s. Quick stop for a beer. Solid beer choices.
* Camping at the Vik campsites. Super popular and busy spot but we were able to grab a nice spot with a great view. 

**Day 4:** The last two days started to take a toll on my wife who was not feeling super well so we decided to slow things down. We knew we would eventually head back east to Reykjavik, and the weather was calling for heavy rain all day, so we decided to commit a lot of the day to driving. But first, we went a bit further west. 

* Skaftafell. Another great visitors center. We did the two most popular hikes, the glacier hike and Svartifoss. Both worth it. If the weather was a bit better and we had more time we definitely would have done one of the longer (\~10km) hikes. 
* Vik. A quick stop back in Vik to explore the town a bit more. Unbelievable views from the church.
* Camping at Stokkseyri campsites. We loved the vibe of Stokkseyri. It felt like a fishing village in the Canadian maritimes and had a quiet, slow-paced feel. Great camping too. 

**Day 5:** This was a day where we tried to do a few of the things we missed earlier in the trip. 

* Stokkseyri beach. Tiny beach but lots of shells and cool rocks.
* Stokkseyri sundlaug. Another sundlaug. Another soak. Another relaxing time. 
* Kerid crater. Free parking but 600 ISK per person to enter. Definitely worth it. Quick easy hike around the rim with awesome views. 
* Reykjadalur Thermal River. Going into the trip, this was one of my must-sees. It did not disappoint. The hike was solid and the geothermal river just felt mind boggling. Beautiful views along the way. 
* Explored Hveragerdi. Beautiful little town with lots of character. Nice place to walk around. 
* Camping at Hveragerdi campsites. Nice spot. 

**Day 6:** As the trip went on, our plan for this day changed constantly. We finally landed on either doing the Snaefellsnes Peninsula or exploring Reykjavik by foot. We went with the latter. Whether it was the ""right"" choice, who knows. But it was a great choice and therefore the right one.

* We bought a 24-hour Reykjavik city pass. SOOOOO worth the money. It cost 5500 ISK per person but we covered that easily. My wife and I both like history and learning about the places we visit, so we knew we'd hit multiple museums. Beyond that, it gets you admission to a bunch of different sundlaugs and free access to the bus system in Reykjavik. 
* Museum tour: National Gallery of Iceland, Settlement Exhibition, Maritime Museum, Art Museum (Hafnarhus), and National Museum of Iceland. All were worth the stop for sure. My favorite was the Settlement Exhibition while my wife loved the Art Museum. 
* Harpa. We swung by the Harpa and caught the end of an Icelandic opera singer performing inside. Even walking around inside without a tour was very cool. 
* Fish and chips at Reykjavik Chips. Delicious stop. 
* Sundhollin sundlaug. One final soak. 
* Camping at the Lava Hostel. Not the greatest, but close to the city. 

**Day 7:** Our final day was returning our van and getting out to the airport for a 3pm flight. 

**Camper:** We knew we wanted to do the van life/camper van experience. There's no shortage of options in Iceland--we saw at least a dozen different companies offering conversion vans of all sizes, not to mention the companies that rent the crossover SUVs with the pop-up tents on top. My research focused on Camp Easy, Cozy Campers, Go Camper, Happy Campers, and Koku. We went with Cozy Campers mainly because of the price. They were offering a Black Friday discount when we booked which made them significantly cheaper. They also offered a sink with running water and a fridge which were huge. The main downside was the transportation options to and from the airport. 

**Budget:** We didn't have a true *budget*, per se, but our aim was to save money where possible and did a lot to make that happen. See the tips below. Here is a screenshot of our entire trip, broken down into categories.

https://preview.redd.it/voonr1ve24gf1.png?width=695&format=png&auto=webp&s=83f6999770dc5f07aeec1efa72034a1ea4c63213

**Tips:** Here is what we learned. 

* Be flexible. The weather changes, road conditions change, volcanoes erupt..your plans will change. Roll with the punches. There is SO MUCH to do and see and you won't see it all in one trip. My number one must-see was Mulagljufur Canyon and we didn't do it. The trip was still incredible. Some of the best highlights were things that I didn't plan for. 
* Pack for layers of merino wool and synthetics. We focused on quick dry stuff and merino wool. Great options for the rain. Good rain gear and hiking boots are an absolute must. 
* Go to the sundlaugs. We did not have any on our list and went to three. If you don't need the full ""spa"" experience at the full spa price, these are the perfect option. It feels more ""authentic"" and you can get the same amount of relaxation out of them. We loved them and loved that they are part of the culture of Iceland.  
* Pack food. We knew we would be camping and knew food would be expensive so the majority of our one checked bag was food. We packed protein bars, tea, coffee, trail mix, some sweet treats, homemade oatmeal packs for breakfast, beef jerky, dehydrated meals for camping/backpacking, rice side dishes (i.e., Uncle Ben's, Zatarain's, etc), ramen, cooking oil, sugar, and spices. Some of this we already had at home, some stuff we bought at Costco. Either way, it saved us so much money on groceries and honestly, when you're cooking dinner in the back of a van at 10pm after hiking and exploring all day, you want something fast and easy.
* Get an eSim. We went with Airalo. It's $17 for 5 GB of data. We paid $12.50 because we had someone's referral code. We left Iceland with 300 MB left. We had no connectivity issues and really only used data for navigating, research, some messaging, and some social media. Pull up your next destination on Google Maps, hit start, then put your phone in airplane mode. The route will continue and take you to your destination but uses less data as it's not constantly acquiring a signal. 
* You don't need to book camping ahead of time, but it doesn't hurt for the places closest to Reykjavik. We had two close calls at the Lava Hostel Campsite and even Hveragerdi. 

If you made it this far, good on ya, and thanks for reading. Hopefully this can help with someone's planning. We loved our trip and I'm already planning the next one.

1mdosgo,https://www.reddit.com/r/globalinvestorlife/comments/1mdosgo/cheap_cheap_places_to_escape_and_retire/,Cheap cheap places to escape and retire,"Retiring in the U.S. on just Social Security is getting tougher by the year. With the average monthly pay-out sitting just under **$2,000**, that barely covers rent in most American cities‚Äîlet alone groceries, healthcare, or travel.

But if you're open to living abroad, Asia opens up a whole new game board.

According to a recent **International Living** report, there are several cities across Asia where you can live comfortably on **less than $1,500/month**‚Äîwith no need to sacrifice lifestyle, safety, or even creature comforts. These places offer warm weather, rich culture, and a slower, more affordable pace of life. Here are some of the top picks:

# Penang, Malaysia

Penang gives you the full package: historic streets, tropical beaches, spicy street food, and a large English-speaking expat community. The cost of living is shockingly low:

* Rent a 3-bedroom near the city for just **$380/month**
* A good cappuccino: **$3**
* Three-course meal for two: **$15**
* Total monthly living expenses (minus rent): \~$500 for a single, \~$1,000 for a couple

# Chiang Mai, Thailand

Nestled in the northern mountains, Chiang Mai is the spiritual and cultural heart of Thailand. It‚Äôs packed with ancient temples, markets, and cafes. Prices?

* 3-bedroom condo: **$300/month**
* Coffee: **Under $1**
* Dinner for two: **$10**
* Full monthly cost for a couple: **$600‚Äì$1,000**

# Phnom Penh, Cambodia

The capital of Cambodia brings a mix of French colonial flair, modern comforts, and super low costs. It‚Äôs easy to get around and visa rules are lenient.

* A solid local apartment: **$300‚Äì$500/month**
* Fancy night out: **$40 for two**
* Local beer: **$0.75** *Note: One source listed $1,100 for a nicer 900 sq ft apartment, but most expats live comfortably for much less.*

# Kuching, Malaysia

Less known than Penang but just as charming, Kuching offers riverside vibes, food hawkers, and easy access to rainforest getaways. Think laid-back city with great weather.

* Rent (3-bedroom): **\~$700/month**
* Coffee: **$0.60**
* Additional costs for a couple: **\~$500/month**

# Hoi An, Vietnam

This UNESCO World Heritage Site combines beach life, old-world charm, and Vietnamese cuisine. The entire town center is pedestrian-only, giving it a peaceful, traffic-free feel.

* Gorgeous beaches just minutes from home
* Plenty of expat caf√©s, wellness retreats, and street food for $1‚Äì$2 a meal
* Housing is cheap, especially if you rent long-term outside the tourist core

For anyone living on Social Security, these six cities could mean the difference between scraping by and truly enjoying retirement. The bonus? Most of them offer **long-stay visas**, **affordable healthcare**, and **vibrant expat communities** already waiting for you.",1,1753926024.0,globalinvestorlife,0,1.0,False

This pregnancy I haven‚Äôt gained any weight even though I feel like I‚Äôve been eating terribly lately, I‚Äôve actually lost 10 lbs over the last 4 months. 

Aside from the subtle weight loss despite my terrible eating, I‚Äôve been craving sugar ALOT lately. I‚Äôve started to bring a phenomenal amount of snacks to work lately because I‚Äôll randomly feel throughout the day that I NEED some sugar. I started to notice it and tried to cut it out and only bring an average amount of healthy snacks and I found myself driving to the gas station on lunch to get a pop tart that I was literally craving.

Recently, the last two weeks, I‚Äôve been having trouble sleeping because Everytime I start to drift off I get an overwhelming urge to go pee like I literally can‚Äôt get comfortable because I have to pee so bad. When I do go to urinate it feels like there‚Äôs nothing left in me but I feel the need too so bad.

Finally, within the last couple days, my left pinkie toe has randomly gone numb throughout the day and night. ONLY my pinkie toe no other part of my body. I did get some work boots recently but if anything they feel very spacious. I believe I may have a fungal infection on my pinkie toe and I frequently get severe dry skin I have to peel off on the back side of my foot but I‚Äôve never felt this numbness before.

Does anyone have any idea what I may be experiencing? I have blood test scheduled for whenever I‚Äôm available but I guess I just wanna know if I need to be urgent about it or if I‚Äôm overthinking ",0,1753926020.0,diabetes_t2,3,0.5,False

This is probably going to be long. My fianc√© and I have taken on a large task as part of our 3 year anniversary and our 2 year anniversary living in Durham. We want to visit everywhere in Durham!

To do this, we have a large map on our wall filled with places we are going to see, and our goal is to see *everything.*

If people are interested, I would love to showcase periodic updates with places as we grow our map. This project grew out of a love for our city. We noticed a continued habit to visit the same places over and over, so we decided to push ourselves to explore Durham. I hope this also inspires others to do the same and explore outside of your comfort zone! 

As for the board, any location that does not have a pin next to it has been unvisited. Once we visit, we put a color-coordinated pin in its place. Sadly, if a place is closed before we are able to visit, we put a black pin next to it. RIP Not Just Paper.

Please give suggestions for where we should visit this week! Your favorite unmarked locations would be very helpful. Also, if you see any locations no-longer open, let me know so I can memorialize them with a black pin. üìç

1mdos45,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeePH/comments/1mdos45/is_starting_a_homebased_coffee_business_worth_it/,Is starting a home-based coffee business worth it?,"Hi everyone! I‚Äôm currently in the research and development stage of planning a home-based coffee business and wanted to get some honest feedback or advice from anyone who‚Äôs done something similar.

The idea is to operate everything from home. I‚Äôll be retailing Filipino coffee products. Specifically:

Ground coffee
Coffee drip bags
Ready-to-drink coffee cups

My focus is on offering a home-brewing experience, giving people convenient ways to enjoy high-quality Filipino coffee at home, especially for those who want something better than instant, but don‚Äôt have brewing equipment or time to prepare a full cup traditionally.

Right now, I'm doing product testing, supplier sourcing, and studying packaging, delivery logistics, and marketing strategies. It‚Äôs still early, but I want to be sure I‚Äôm putting my energy into something worthwhile.

So my question is: Is a home-based retail coffee business still worth pursuing in 2025?

I know the coffee market is saturated, but I feel like there‚Äôs still a space for niche, culturally-rooted, and convenience-focused coffee experiences. But I could be wrong, and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm here asking.

Any input would be appreciated:

Have you done a similar business model?

What challenges should I expect?

Any advice for someone focusing on retailing from home?


Thanks in advance!

This went on for years, tried to speak to her about it multiple times but she would avoid me by blocking me and stuff. Recently said to her in person we should speak and she seems to agree and actually seemed to open up but we only had a few mins alone so I planned to actually arrange to get coffee and then when I did she sent me a fucking chat gpt written message through her bf. She‚Äôs never fully told me what her issues are with me but in her message she makes it clear she thinks I‚Äôm equally to blame and that we were codependent on each other. WE WERE NOT. I was busy cleaning up her depression room, taking her out the house to get away from her mum , buying her snack, being there for her through her depression and anxiety, giving understanding and kindness and doing whatever I could to HELP. And while she did help back occasionally it was always because it suited her to do so like if I was having a panic attack while walking and she could call me to talk while I walked to help me calm it. But if I had any panic attacks that were not convenient for her she got angry with me. 

Anyway now I can‚Äôt even hang out with my friends because if she‚Äôs there all I can do it fight myself to not scream at her and make everyone else uncomfortable. She doesn‚Äôt deserve these friends and I‚Äôm so fucking angry about so much but rn what im most angry about is that im having to distance myself from the group because i actually cannot just enjoy their company anymore. Im not in the group chat and ive had to leave multiple times but this time ive realised i cant go back. I tried to see them at the weekend for the first time in months and she was there and i was fighting myself the entire time and it felt like i was just in some sort of psychological battle with her over them. I dont want to let her win, she absolutely does not deserve it, she is a truly awful person so it makes me feel sick if i consider actually leaving my group of friend entirely for my own sake. I need everyone to wake up and see her for what she is but it‚Äôll never happen and now I‚Äôm probably seen as the bitch because I can‚Äôt shut up and be okay.",1,1753925695.0,Anger,0,1.0,False

1mdomqt,https://www.reddit.com/r/thenurserynurse/comments/1mdomqt/why_i_think_reece_is_not_gerladines_rk_and_who_i/,"Why I think Reece is not Gerladine's R.K., and who I think it is.","SPOILERS FOR JULY 30, 2025'S 9PM FACEBOOK VIDEO! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.

I just saw the video where Geraldine says Reece and her are having an affair. Personally, I'm going to think that this is a nightmare, a hallucination or a what-if. Here are my reasons why I don't believe it:

* Geraldine would not feel guilty and would not apologize to Marjorie if it were true. She consistently treats the nursery staff like trash. She would not care about her feelings at all. Her apologizing for the affair and announcing it to not blindside Marjorie would be out of character. She's never been a decent human before. Why start now?
* Geraldine has always entered the office happy or something about the graduation since the affair. She never seemed sad, guilty, or like she had wanted to be telling Marjorie about the affair ever as she said in that video.
* These hints:
   * Geraldine being gone while Reece wasn't answering the door and Reece not answering the doorbell. Unfortunate coincidence.
   * Geraldine seeming to have phone calls at the same time as Reece's secretive phone calls. Coincidence. Maybe Reece is planning something for Marjorie he doesn't want her to know about, as it's a surprise which is why he's having secret phone calls and not telling her about them. Unfortunate coincidence.
   * Reece smelling like her perfume could just be that Geraldine sprayed her perfume while Reece was walking by.
* Marjorie has a history of spiraling when she feels uncertain. Remember when she thought Reece and Charlotte were having an affair, when Charlotte was just his temporary therapist? It wouldn‚Äôt be shocking if she had a nightmare where her worst fear came true, especially under stress.
* Reece is an incredibly dedicated uncle and husband. He loves his sister, his niblings, and his wife. He dedicated his free time to taking care of his niece and nephew for Autumn and Winter. Why would he give all that up for the piece of trash we know as Geraldine? Someone he and EVERYONE at the nursery loathes? Autumn would disown him in a heartbeat and he knows that and would never give that up.
* Marjorie saw the dirty photo that R.K. sent her on the tablet. We don't know exactly what it was, because it was censored. But it had a skin-toned colored blur, so I'm assuming it's a nude photo. We know Marjorie and Reece know each other's bodies very well. Wouldn't she instantly recognize her husband's nude body and know for a fact it was him? But after she saw it, she was still unsure. Them thinking it could be Becky, a woman, or Bob/Reece/Roger, implies that they couldn't tell the gender of the person in the photo.
* Reece not being at the meeting with Roger could be: Roger lying about Reece to stir the pot, or Reece was planning something he doesn't want to Marjorie to know about so he lied and said he's at a meeting.
* Geraldine and R.K. were talking about ""A"" finding out. If the Reece was R.K., we assume ""A"" is Autumn. But wouldn't they be more concerned about ""M"" (Marjorie) over Autumn? I mean, yeah, Autumn would stand up and support Marjorie, and would probably beat the crap out of Reece for this, but he's used to that. Being more concerned about Autumn's reaction than Marjorie's doesn't logically make sense to me. Unless he truly doesn't care about Marjorie anymore.

Most likely, I have a feeling it's Rebecca ""Becky"" King!

* Although Bob is the only one Geraldine has shown explicit romantic interest toward in the past, he has not shown any feelings back for him. In fact, we've barely seen Bob and Geraldine actually interact at all.
* Becky, on the other hand, is the only one who genuinely likes Geraldine. She‚Äôs shown consistent affection and friendliness that others haven‚Äôt and is unaware of her rudeness.
* ""A"" is Becky's husband Alan and/or Becky's daughter Audrey.
* Geraldine is planning a dramatic reveal of this relationship at the preschooler's graduation. If it were Reece, she‚Äôd be outing herself to people who adore Marjorie. She‚Äôd be booed off the stage. But if it‚Äôs Becky, someone less connected, someone the staff doesn‚Äôt fully know, she thinks she can get away with it.
* Geraldine has been a bit homophobic in the past, that doesn't mean she is not seeing a woman. The Shivian storyline is proof of that.
* R.K. says announcing this [""it will blow everything up.""](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=742973505133250&set=a.142914061805867) If it's Becky, I'm assuming it is referring to her marriage with Alan.
* R.K. called her [""Ger"" ](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=742973505133250&set=a.142914061805867)in their texts.

* R.K. says [""I have no reason to be at that graduation. I don't even work there.""](https://www.facebook.com/photo?fbid=742973505133250&set=a.142914061805867)
   * It's not ""I don't even work there anymore."" which rules out Reece in my opinion. as Geraldine has said, he was there for their journeys in the beginning. *(I worked as a high school teacher for two years, and now I'm not, but I still want to attend my students' graduation for the next few years until the freshman I taught graduate, because I care about them!)*
   * This also rules out Roger, he works there.
   * Bob would have reason to be there as he is a parent there, and Geraldine is inviting all parents.
* Geraldine seemed jealous when Sorscha said ""Becky and Bob are cute,"" and then met a ""friend"" for coffee who was a ""she"" and suspiciously seemed to want to hide this meeting from Sorscha.
* Geraldine has R.K. saved in her phone with a blue heart emoji and has sends R.K. blue hearts. This seems deliberate, why would they be blue hearts as opposed to red/pink hearts? Given Becky has blue hair, this is another hint it's her.
* Geraldine's line ""Hopefully your second wedding will be better"" and ""you have to sort some things (implying a divorce) out"" could apply to Reece or Becky because both are currently married and a divorce would take a while. It would take even longer with Becky though, because she has a kid with Alan Roger and Bob are single, so they wouldn't have to ""take care of"" a divorce.

1mdokzy,https://www.reddit.com/r/OlderGenZ/comments/1mdokzy/has_anyone_ever_noticed_a_discrepancy_in/,Has anyone ever noticed a discrepancy in communication styles?,"I feel like we have a way more direct, straight to the point style of communication when compared to some previous generation. We can't be bothered either, so our dialogue is tuned to avoid small talk. Take an order at a coffee shop, for example. We literally say what we want, say thank you, wait for our order, and go on with our day. People from previous generations seem to involve a lot more dialogue in mundane interactions.

In my personal experience, dialogue with millenials is still very easy despite them being more extroverted in general, but it becomes harder with previous generations given that they expect a lot of information at once.

This last weekend, I told my mother in law that a friend of ours was in Miami due to their Instagram story. That was it. She asked with who that friend was, when did they go, what places they're visiting, for how long they're staying, and all I could answer was ""I don't know"", because I literally didn't have that information. 

This is something that happens all the time with a lot of people in my life. It seems like people from older generations tend to want more context and additional information than we do. My girlfriend noticed that they tend to have longer dialogue, longer texts, and generally more information thrown around, even if it's irrelevant.

If I could make an analogy, I'd say that I feel that we talk in bullet points whilst they talk in long paragraphs, and that generates gaps in communication. Maybe that has to do with how we process information, especially on the internet.",5,1753925432.0,OlderGenZ,3,0.86,False
