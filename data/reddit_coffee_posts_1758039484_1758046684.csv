1nip4k6,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1nip4k6/a_perfect_day_for_naturafish/,A Perfect Day for Naturafish,"There was me, my sister, my mom, my dad and my grandparents on my mom's side in the small unit in the prefab apartment block on Bandaya Street in the capital. And, this morning, there was also you, visiting from overseas.

I still can't believe you got a visa.

They're very hard to get. 

But I'm so happy you're here, that I get to show you a little of my life here.

Right now, it's just past 06:30 and everyone but the sun and my sister are up. She's always been a late riser, but she'll get up eventually, and she'll be sharp as a tack right away. I'm more like my dad, up with the alarm clock but not really awake until a half-hour later.

He's shaving. I bet he nicks himself.

And mom and grandma are in the kitchen, making breakfast with whatever we managed to get yesterday. I'd absolutely kill for an egg, but what they're making does smell good.

Coffee?

Sometimes. Other times we get by on roasted barley with chicory.

My grandpa told us how, during the war, they'd make tea by steeping black, burnt bread crusts in water until the water turned brown. I'm so glad we don't have to do that anymore. We have real tea sometimes now.

Anyway, let's have a bite to eat, and then I'll show you what our days are like.

Sit anywhere you like. It's a small table, but we'll all fit. You're probably not used to tight spaces like these. You do get used to it. I've been living here almost my whole life. My parents were allocated this unit after my sister was born and we met the minimum family replacement size. No, we can't sell it, but it's ours until we don't need it anymore. Everyone of value gets a place to live.

“I'll wait for meat today,” mom says.

Grandma's staying home. Grandpa will try to get butter and milk. “What about you, dad?”

“Nails. Maybe soap.”

And my sister will get bread.

As for us, we'll try to get something special, a rarity. I'm off from school today so it's a “free” day for me. Whatever we get is a bonus.

OK, let's head out.

It's a nice day but you should probably take a jacket. It rains here out of the blue sometimes.

We go out of the unit, down the stairs because the elevator doesn't work, then out of the apartment block. There's a metal playground on the left, but it's empty of children because it's a school day. Surrounding us are generally more buildings identical to the one I live in, and then an exit toward the road. Few cars go by. Instead, most people are on foot, lined up on the sidewalk going both directions.

We join.

“What's that way?” I ask, pointing south.

“Fruit, coal and herring,” somebody says without looking at us. “Or so I hear.”

“And north?”

“Chocolate. That's what I always hope for. Maybe one day. I had chocolate once, a decade ago…”

“So these people don't know what they’re lining up for?” you ask me.

“Usually they have some idea, but not always. But there's always something at the start of a lineup. Otherwise people wouldn't line up.”

“How do they have time to just stand there?”

“Most of them don't work. The government is very efficient, so only the ones who need to work, work. The ones good at what they're doing. Everybody else, the normal people, we line up to get what the government provides. I know it's very different from the system you're used to.”

We stand in the line going north.

Slowly, we move.

Eventually, about an hour later, we come to an intersection. The roads are still empty, save for the odd black car every once in a while, which honks and whom we make way for, so our lineup crosses the intersection at a diagonal, intersecting at one point with a line going a different direction.

“Keep right for chocolate?” I ask.

“Chocolate? This is the queue for vodka and beets,” says an elderly man.

“And the other one?”

He looks at me, at you. “Refrigerator sign-ups.”

“If you want chocolate, there's a rumour they're giving it out on Potomskaya Street,” someone yells from within one of the two lineups.

“Wishful thinking!” yells another.

We merge into the other lineup and continue, passing people on the right when we can. Some give us dirty looks. Others smile at us because we're young and have so much ahead of us. “Sorry, we're not queuing here. We're just trying to get through,” I offer repeatedly as an explanation.

“Where are we going?” you ask me, as I pull you along. Although this is all so mundane, I'm exhilarated that I get to share it with you. 

“To where the chocolate might be,” I say.

“What if there is no chocolate?”

“Then it'll be like every other day.” But I hope it's not. It can't be. Not with you here.

On the left, we pass a row of makeshift tents, people getting in and out of them. You ask who they are, and I explain that they're prospectors, citizens who attempt to predict the routes of future queues to be able to get a head start on them. “They sleep here?”

“Yes.”

By the time we reach the vicinity of Potomskaya Street, we hear engines and music, and I remember suddenly there's a foreign delegation in the city today, but before I can explain, a police officer stops us.

“Papers,” he says.

I pull mine out, and show him your passport and visa too. He examines the documents closely before handing them back. “Do you have non-queue travel permits?”

“As a student, I'm allowed—”

“Fine, yes.”

“Do you want to see my school identification card?”

“No,” he says. “That's fine.”

“Would it be possible to maybe get close enough to the delegation to take a look?” I ask. “My guest, she is in our country for the first time.”

“As long as you don't get too close,” he says, then drops his voice to a whisper: “And if you take Glory to the Revolution Pedestrian Overpass across to where the municipal district is, they're giving out Naturafish. Special token. Get one for your lady.”

I'm about to protest that I don't have a special token, I'm not from a well placed family, when I feel his hand touch mine and a token pressed into it “Thank you,” I whisper.

“Remember something. Life is beautiful, and it's a perfect day for Naturafish.”

I thank him again clandestinely and we head toward a hill from which we can see a bend in Potomskaya Street, and the foreign delegation being welcomed. The street is lined with people waving flags.

“So many people,” you say.

“Yes, to make a good impression. But they're not normal people. They're actors from the state acting academies. They're playing real people. Look—” I point, and you put your hand above your eyes to block out the sun. “—there's the actor playing me. Do you see?”

“I think so, but he looks nothing like you,” you say.

“There's probably an actress playing you too. They're always on top of who's here and who isn't, and I'm sure the foreign delegation would be honoured to meet you, by which I mean the actress playing you.”

“What do you think I'll say?”

“That you are impressed by the economic development of the country, the cleanliness of its public spaces, and the increase of its agricultural output.”

You smile, and I smile too. “But I'm sure she'll be nowhere near as pretty as you,” I say.

We walk down the hill hand in hand and join another lineup. Ahead, holding a small radio to his ear, a bearded man calls out, “Sixty fourth minute and still nil-nil, but the Uruguayans are fouling our boys like animals. Brutal tactics. They couldn't cope with our speed otherwise. Oh, what's this? A red card for Uruguay's captain and a free kick to us at the edge of the penalty area. Could this be the breakthrough?”

“That's Platonov,” I explain. “He's something of a folk hero around here. He used to be a very good footballer, before his injury.”

“I didn't know there were any matches going on right now,” you say.

“There aren't. Our team has been banned from international competitions by the governing bodies."" You notice that the radio isn't emitting any sound. “Platonov merely pretends to listen to a real football broadcast, and relates to us what he pretends, and we follow along. Even the newspapers report on what he pretends. Today, it's our second group match of the World Cup. We're in a group with Uruguay, Cameroon and the Netherlands. And once this World Cup is over in a few weeks, Platonov will pretend another into existence, and so on, so there's always a World Cup going on. In some ways, it's better than the real thing. We don't always win. In fact, we haven't even made the final since February of last year.”

“Why does he do it?”

“For the love of sport and his fellow man.”

“Goooaaalll!” Platonov yells. “What a strike, straight into the upper left corner. Sanchez-Lobos didn't stand a chance. We're ahead. Twenty-two minutes left. Can we hang on? A win would set us up perfectly for the final matchday, but even a draw will do. Come on, boys! Come on!”

Everyone in the lineup cheers, including me and you, and you lean against my shoulder.

The lineups wriggle forward like snakes, crossing, merging, intertwining and forking, splitting apart, like veins across the city. The people in them talk and laugh and commiserate. “How are you?” “My husband's sick again.” “It could be worse: you could be sick.” “My children are hungry.” “Whose aren't?” “Can you hold my place in line?” “Yes, sure.” “I'm waiting on medical results.” “So you're healthy at least until then.” “My washing machine broke again.” “It was a Sovpral. It did you a favour.” “We've no hot water in our building.” “The electricity goes out every day after fourteen o'clock, but you can come over and boil some to bathe your baby.”

It's late afternoon by the time we locate the queue the police officer told me about. It's shorter than the others, as all special token queues are. You can tell the individuals in this lineup are more refined, less plain. These are people who have performed services for the motherland.

Around us, the municipal district looks upon us in all its concrete neoclassical grandeur.

“This is a really nice spot,” you say.

“Yes, it cost a lot of money to build. The city was supposed to be governed from here.”

“Supposed?”

“It's abandoned. The buildings are empty, mostly unfinished on the inside. The project was part of a five-year plan, but it wasn't completed in time. The fifth year rolled into a sixth, and the new five-year plan didn't want to finish up the last one's projects. Every five-year plan wants to be independent, its own thing, you know.”

For the first time I'm nervous, feeling the token in my pocket with sweating fingers. What if it's a set-up? The lineup moves quickly, and soon we are the front, in one of the unfinished buildings. Two women, both dressed in grey, sit behind a counter. One holds out her hand as the other says, “Token, please.”

I hand it over.

“Is it true this is the lineup for Naturafish?” I ask.

“Yes,” says the first, handing me a small unmarked tin. I can almost smell what it contains. My eyes fill with tears, but I don't allow myself to cry. Mom and dad, sister, grandma and grandpa will be so pleasantly surprised. “Thank you,” I say, already pulling you by the hand and shuffling to the side so the next person in line may get their tin.

We take our time walking back.

It's already evening.

“What's Naturafish?” you ask softly, still holding my hand. It's a lovely feeling.

“It's a synthetic form of tuna manufactured from soybeans we receive from Brazil under the beneficial terms of our trade agreement.” Because I can see your smile wilt, “It's considered better than the real thing,” I add. “Better tasting, better for the environment, more nutritious and a domestically-made product on top of that. It's something of a point of pride for us, a symbol of what we're capable of as a state.”

We arrive back at the apartment just in time for dinner, which mom is preparing.

She did not succeed in getting any meat and did not want to camp out until morning, but dad managed two bars of soap and two batteries, sister got bread, and grandpa was able to get a bottle of milk but no butter. “Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow,” he says.

“Butter luck,” you say, and everyone laughs.

The electricity falters then fails, which means the lights suddenly go out, but we have candles. I light them and arrange them across the unit.

The flames flicker in the breeze.

The light is warm.

“I wasn't in the mood for butter anyway,” says dad.

“Me neither,” adds sister.

At the end of the meal, I take out the tin of Naturafish and lay it on the table.

“Is it…”

“Yes,” I say.

In that moment, as I let grandpa open the tin, revealing the flakes of Naturafish inside, I know what you must be thinking. That it's a small tin. In your country, you would probably have one tin per person, and I wonder if you can ever truly understand what life is like here. But then mom passes out the dessert forks that dad and I made  from scrap metal years ago. And as we take turns tasting the Naturafish, talking, laughing, sharing the experiences of our days, I believe you can and do, and it fills me with the greatest joy.

“Does anyone happen to know if we won the match today?” dad asks.

“We were up 1-0 in the sixty-eighth minute,” you say.

“Dirty Uruguayans,” says grandma.

“I'm sure it'll be in the newspaper tomorrow.”

“Does anyone want coffee?”

“I do.”

“Me too.”

“But we've ve nothing to heat the water with,” I say, pointing at the candles.

Grandpa gets up from his chair, crosses to the window and looks out. “It seems they have power a few buildings down. I know a man who lives there, Ivan. I'll get some hot water from him and bring it back.”

“It's really no big deal. You don't have to,” you say.

“Don't be ridiculous,” says grandpa in that way we have of accepting gratitude by being mock aggressive. It means he likes you. 

I like you too.

I may not have much, but what I have I want to share with you. The sun sets. Grandpa returns. The water's no longer hot. Grandpa spent time talking to Ivan, whose daughter is getting married soon. But it's warm, and warm is good enough. Maybe not for real coffee, but for roasted barley and chicory it is, and that's all we have, and we're grateful for that, talking and laughing until bedtime.",1,1758046336.0,stories,1,1.0,False

1niovlf,https://www.reddit.com/r/offmychest/comments/1niovlf/coming_out_of_a_toxic_friendship_and_they_still/,Coming out of a toxic friendship and they still want to talk,"I (41f) met my friend (40f) 10 years ago and the last decade has been extremely traumatising for multiple reasons that are too long to explain, but it involved abuse, reconciling with a history of SA for the first time, and health issues for myself and my kid while being a solo parent. When we first met, I didn't think we had a lot in common but I thought she was nice. We ended up working together, so we’d see each other 5 days a week and often had a hang out on the weekend. 

Less than a year into knowing her, my kid developed a health issue that required us to suddenly move back to my home country for insurance affordability and that's when a lot of crap hit the fan with my family. That time period was a daily struggle and while I'm not the kind of friend who has no time for people if I'm going through something hard, I did notice she wanted what seemed to be an unfair amount of my attention. There were days with my kid's illness where I would hold them for hours as they cried. Meanwhile my parents were being abusive toward me and interfering with my little family. I was financially stuck while trying to find solutions that seemed impossible. Then the #MeToo movement happened and in my exhaustion, SA trauma poured out of me. It was a lot. Those years feel like a blur of survival mode. And the texts I would get *every day* from her repeated the same three complaints daily- life complaints about situations she clearly had no intention of shifting when they were actually quite solvable- along with a list of everything she was doing and everything that was going on in my former office (where she still worked) each day. She just reported her day to me which confused me because I didn't have a response to: I'm getting coffee, I'm getting lunch, I've had X amount of phone calls today, etc. It wasn't a conversation, it was broadcasting. 

I tried to respond here and there but I was in Europe and she was in the U.S. We had a major time difference, so I would wake up to an onslaught of messages that I mostly didn’t know how to respond to. So, I’d just text to ask how she was doing and respond to a few things. She would ask me how I was but I sometimes wondered if it was just to get me to respond when I'd been non-responsive because it was met with ""I'm sorry, that sucks,"" and an immediate redirect back to her. 

After 3 years of trying to find a medical solution for my kid and realising this was a chronic illness that was going to persist, I decided we needed to just get out of where we were and back to the place where my kid and I had made a home of our own and felt safer. Then Covid hit, both of us got extremely sick, and our departure was put off by almost a year. Again, too many details to get into but my parents tried to interfere with us leaving and it was a fight to just get on the plane. When we came back, we were both exhausted mentally and physically and had a lot to process and heal from. As a parent, I'm not allowed to fall apart but I was freshly and recently traumatised even further than I had been for most of my life. So, I compartmentalised and soldiered on trying to give my kid the resources they needed. 

The next few years were a struggle. As a solo parent, I’m the only breadwinner. My job was demanding but it was keeping our heads above water financially. Basically, I was just prioritising everything necessary above myself and my friend was supposedly there for me. I would have thoughts about our friendship that I didn’t have space to process. I had too much in front of me that demanded immediate attention so I never pulled these thoughts about her to the forefront of my mind and processed them or noticed patterns. And during that time I made other friends as well, while she did not and made me more and more the person she relied on- mostly just for attention. All she wanted was constant attention. 

My kid grew up and moved out and for the first time in my life, I was able to truly address my own trauma and sit with it. I’m all about mental health so I took active steps to process and heal. I noticed my friend couldn't seem to have serious conversations. She would listen but it always felt like she was just waiting for her turn to speak about herself. She'd only give canned responses. “That sucks… I’m sorry… That’s too bad.” Sometimes she’d say those things when what I was talking about wasn’t negative and I was like, Are you even listening?? And the conversations she wanted to have instead were superficial and repetitive. So repetitive. She would cycle through the same things over and over again, even repeating the same joke all the time. She wanted to do the same activities all the time. And she was very negative about her life but made no efforts to change anything. My life has been rough but I’m always trying to make things better. As my own chronic illnesses became worse and my energy faded, I started to feel like I had no space for anything but work and her. It made me feel stuck and my depression increased as the voice that was monopolising my ear was quite negative. I would have to make excuses to not hang out every weekend, which she wanted. I would have to make excuses to not answer the phone because she’d want to call me on her commute home to talk about everything she’d texted me about all day. Or she’d call me on the way to us meeting up so she could fill the time until we met. I found myself reacting to her contact with the same anxiety I do to a full inbox at work. And she was filling inboxes- sending me dozens of Instagram messages, Facebook messages, etc. It was like homework keeping up with everything she was sending at me. 

And the daily reporting continued and accelerated, even when checked. It became more detailed and banal. Here’s what I bought at the grocery store and also here’s a picture of it. Here’s the 5th picture of my dog that I’ve sent you today lying in the same position he’s been in each time. It felt like I was being compressed and had no air.

I've had a bad 2025. I had a death in the family, an upsetting situation with someone else I was close to, my beloved dog was injured, my finances took a hit, my health declined, and I was told I needed a biopsy for cervical cancer. I know my life has been a lot- it's a lot for me, too. So, I don't expect someone else to be able to take it on either but I noticed she couldn't even have one conversation about me saying I was concerned about the cancer scare. Meanwhile, the more rundown and emotionally spent I became, the more she unloaded her life details onto me. It started to feel like she took advantage of moments of my vulnerability to insinuate herself deeper into my life and mind, filling me with the minutia of her day more and more. Her communication bombarded me all day and evening in the midst of a demanding job and strained health. She wanted to be heard and entertained more and more the less I had energy to even keep myself going. 

I also noticed she didn't listen. She wants us to live together now that I'm an empty nester. I don't want that. I want my home to always be open to my kid if they need or want to return. And I'm otherwise independent and enjoy my space. But despite telling her this, she will repeatedly say, ""If only we could find an affordable place for the two of us, we could live together."" And I would have to check her each time. She did it again about a month ago and I looked at her and repeated myself to her blank stare. It’s like she creates this world in her head and I’m a character in it that she projects onto. More than that, she seems to try to conflate our identities. We're not at all alike, we don't even look alike. But she will say things that make comparisons that truly aren't there, which I find odd and off putting. 

This summer, I knew my mental health was stretched so I took some time off work to reset. She attempted to flood that time somehow thinking if I were off work, it meant I had even more time for her. I pushed back and told her I wanted to engage less in screen time. I have PTSD, OCD, and ADHD and being constantly signaled all day is triggering, distracting, and anxiety inducing. The more I told her I was taking a step back, the more she pushed. I even explained it was for my health and she ignored that. I pulled back my communication and my sharing. It didn't deter her. One day I texted her three times and she texted me 22. She no longer seemed to care if I was sharing about my life, she only wanted me to be an audience for hers. It no longer mattered if I responded, it just needed to be sent to me.

I recently went through the biopsy after 3 months of waiting and she barely showed any concern or care for me. In fact, we were having dinner the weekend before it and after talking about her for the first 10-15 minutes without her asking me anything in return, I volunteered that I was a little anxious about the upcoming procedure (which is very painful and which I've been through before and it was terrible). She interrupted me in the middle of the word “anxious” to talk about something else that was truly nothing. Something her dad had said that day. I froze and wanted to address it but knew if I did, it would blow up and I just wanted to get through the biopsy. After the procedure, I was recuperating for days. It's painful and you bleed, so you have to keep your mobility down. One day, I woke up to several texts from her. I didn't answer for some time. So, she asked me how I was. I said I was actually having a bad day and was in more pain than before, so I was just taking the day to rest. As soon as I said that, as though she hadn’t even read it, she immediately shot me 6 texts with pictures and updates from her day. I've been to the bank, I got my nails done, here's a picture of my nails. Boom, boom, boom. Like she was just waiting for me to wake up so she could download her day into me. I snapped. I told her I was tired of her self-absorption and her need to prioritise her minutia over anything of substance. I said she didn't want a friend, she wanted an audience and didn't seem to actually care about me. I also said that when confronted (which I have done in the past) she redirects to her own victimhood and how she has a bad relationship with her family. I've found myself in the past comforting her over a conversation that started about her crappy behaviour. She can't ever stay on topic without turning it back on herself and she can't apologise for what she does, she just has to always play the victim. I said I was done. 

Now for the last two weeks, she's tried to gloss over it. She sent me a screenshot of a book about breaking free from toxic parents and said she'll be reading it. Ok? It’s like she thinks that’s somehow an offering to me. This isn't about how her parents treat her, it's about how she treats me. She's pushed for us to talk but failed to organise a time. It’s made me realise the burden of arrangements has always been on me, too. After some back and forth on that, she wants to talk tomorrow. I guess it's fair to give her a chance to respond. But for me the friendship is over. I'm only giving space for closure. Honestly, after two weeks in addition to months of trying to pull back in addition to years of her taking energy and attention from me and stepping over boundaries when I was too rundown to treat my supposed best friend as someone I needed to combat, I almost feel like I don't even owe her that conversation. But I want to be fair. I just know it's going to be all about excuses, redirecting, etc. And the thought of it exhausts me. Having space from her has felt like I’ve come out of a fog. It’s given me processing room for myself and for our friendship. It feels like she’s deliberately distracted me for years so she could have a captive companion. I feel stupid because I should’ve known better and held boundaries better. Idk what advice I'm looking for, I'm just spent and anxious about talking tomorrow. Sorry this is so long. Thank you to anyone who’s actually read this. ",1,1758045796.0,offmychest,0,1.0,False

1nioug3,https://www.reddit.com/r/confessions/comments/1nioug3/i_often_lie_to_my_boyfriend_about_being_busy_to/,I often lie to my boyfriend about being busy to avoid meeting his 6-yrs-old nephew,"I feel guilty about this because I love him and his family, and i like kids too but his nephew is making family days insufferable. They meet at his grandparents house and we spend all sundays there.

I've been with my boyfriend since his nephew was 6 month old. The issues started when he turned 1.5 yrs old. Whenever he didn't get something he would throw the craziest temper tantrums. His mom was not negligent but she felt like his son gonna feel like she doesn't love him if he refuses him something so she just gave in. His father clearly annoyed by having to look after him so he bought him everything he wanted so that he doesn't have to play with him. 

He never once faced any consequences for his behaviour which involved hitting, scratching people, breaking anything which he got his hands on. His parents just say ""he is a child""

As he got older the tantrums became worse, like pushing his 87 yrs old great-grandfather with a walking stick on the stairs, breaking cell phones, laptops, TVs. 

His favourite activity is destroying other people's stuff and laughing whenever someone gets sad or angry about it. And he talks back like a 15 yrs old child saying things like shut up and you are stupid.

Everyone would play with him, we have 1000 toys balls, cards, board games, cara, bicycle, mini playground but 5 minutes into playing he starts kicking and fighting and yelling in your face about anything like it is not his turn, or you not allowing him to bike next to the road alone

Every single Sunday is ""arriving at grandpa, little boy comes to me and tells me to play with him. I reply
in a minute just let me finish my coffee. He then starts scrathing my arms and yelling ""NOW"" in my face. Then he starts going through bags, cabinets, everyone is trying to make him understand he can't break other people's belongings he then throws a temper tantrum where he yells like a beast and destroys everything around him. He then gets a toy or ice cream to make him stop and we go home. 

It is constant screaming and hitting and his parents don't do anything but award him.

I tried to bring this up a few times but I was treated like as if I was a monster who hates children. I grounded him once for hitting his baby cousin which caused a huge family drama where I was the enemy for weeks. I don't wanna ruin my relationship with the whole family or cause issues so I just lie about being busy. His great-grandparents criticize them sometimes but very mildly. My boyfriend's cousin had a child-free wedding only because of him.

They took him to 5 different specialists to see if he has ADHD or anything like that. All 5 professionals said he doesn't have any issues, he behaves like this because of the lack of discipline. The parents think all 5 of them are stupid and children don't need discipline he will just grow out of it when he is 7.

I do like the child. He would be a bright boy, but he was so spoiled it is impossible to spend quality time with him.

1niotyn,https://i.redd.it/4ws9hxqnekpf1.jpeg,A tale of two Hydrangeas,"Finally pulled the trigger on Hydrangea after reading so much in this sub.  Experience has been....enlightening, perhaps.    

I was so, so pumped for the Luna (roasted 8/31) - perhaps most expensive coffee per ounce I've ever purchased).  But I simply cannot get anything other than savory egg character with some occasional light tea notes.  Have tried both super hot and cool water.  Grinding coarse-ish, and down to 4 on ZP6.  Deep27 and V60.  If I close my eyes and try really, really hard maybe I can make it have a wisp of blueberry, but probably my imagination.  Even when I open the bag and give it a whiff, it's just...scrambled eggs.  Which isn't terrible, but it's not the fruity flavor explosion I was hoping for.  If anybody has a go-to recipe for this one (I've got a Deep 27, V60, ZP6 and Femobook A4z as options), please let me know.  But I'm wondering if it's the expectation that has been getting me on this, or batch variation, or what.  Maybe I had an idea in my mind of what it was going to taste like and it's just not that.  

On the other hand, the Monteblanco (which I picked almost at random to get me free shipping) is THE BOMB.  First time I made it, I loved it so much I made another cup using **exactly the same method**, which, like never happens.  Smells like toasted coconut and almond - like an Almond Joy.  Also pineapple, sweetly fragrant, with some kind of chewy candy character.  Super delicious.  And yet, this is the one I picked haphazardly.  So, so good - I'd drink this ten times over the Luna, even though it's about half the price.

1niosd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedAndTested/comments/1niosd7/reveal_if_the_best_single_serve_coffee_maker/,Reveal if the Best Single Serve Coffee Maker Keurig K-Elite Delivers,"I’ve been using the Keurig K-Elite coffee maker, model K-Elite, for several months now, and as someone who lives off caffeinated beverages, I can confidently say it has become an integral part of my morning routine. Crafted in a brushed silver finish, it looks sleek and blends well with my kitchen aesthetics. Of course, with everything in life, there are pros and cons.

**Modern Design with Functional Features**

From the moment I unboxed it, its design was a standout. The brushed silver finish is elegant and modern, sitting comfortably on any countertop without taking up unnecessary space. The dimensions, 9.9”D x 12.7”W x 13.1”H, don’t feel overly bulky, yet there’s still plenty of room beneath the machine to fit travel mugs or larger cups. Its removable drip tray accommodates mugs up to 7.2 inches tall, which is a small but thoughtful feature for us multitaskers who drink coffee on the go more than we’d like to admit.

**Customizable Brewing Options**

With its programmable settings, this machine allows full control over your beverage experience. I appreciated the temperature control, enabling me to adjust between 187°F and 192°F. The Strong Brew button has been a lifesaver on groggy Mondays, upping the intensity of my coffee without requiring additional grounds. And let’s not forget the iced coffee setting—a feature that’s earned its weight in gold during sweltering afternoons. Brewing directly over ice is not just convenient but also results in a bold flavor many machines just can’t deliver.

**Large Water Reservoir Saves Time**

One of my favorite aspects has to be the 75oz removable water reservoir. Refilling constantly is a chore, and with this feature, I could easily go through several cups (or servings of oatmeal, thanks to the hot water on demand button) before even thinking about adding more water. If you’re like me and go through several cups during marathon work-from-home days, this feature is a game-changer.  

[Grab Keurig K-Elite at the best price on Amazon.](https://coolpromoproducts.com/p/b0788f3r8x/)

**Key Benefits**

- Five brewing sizes ranging from 4oz to 12oz provide flexibility for all preferences.
- The maintenance reminder conveniently alerts when descaling is needed, ensuring coffee remains flavorful.
- The ability to brew both K-Cup pods and ground coffee caters to multiple types of coffee drinkers.
- Fast brewing time ensures my coffee is ready within minutes—even perfect for rushed mornings.

**Shortcomings**

While the product ticks many boxes in terms of performance, not everything is flawless. A few areas stood out during my daily use:

- The coffee machine’s noise level is higher than expected, which can be distracting during quiet mornings.
- There’s no built-in milk frother, which might disappoint latte or cappuccino lovers.
- The machine feels slightly plastic-heavy, which somewhat detracts from its otherwise premium appearance.

**Competitive Options**

Exploring similar single-serve machines offered valuable insights. Compared to its competitors like the Nespresso VertuoPlus and Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, the K-Elite shines in versatility. The Nespresso offers a sleeker finish and better espresso options but lacks the iced coffee setting. Conversely, the FlexBrew allows for a dual functionality of brewing a pot and single servings, though it doesn’t match the user-friendly customization found in this product. The Keurig fits neatly into the middle ground, excelling at producing both hot and iced drinks without major trade-offs.

**Cost Efficiency**

Given the machine’s capabilities and the sheer convenience it offers, I find it hits a sweet spot regarding price-performance balance. Its large water tank, multi-size brewing capabilities, and custom strength settings elevate it far beyond basic models. While it might initially look like a splurge, I think it’s a long-term investment if you love varied coffee styles throughout the week.

1niorw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1niorw5/the_rainmaker_john_grisham/,The Rainmaker – John Grisham,"Hey everyone,

I wanted to share some thoughts today on a book I recently revisited, and honestly, it still holds up wonderfully: [The Rainmaker – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-rainmaker-john-grisham/). If you're looking for a gripping story that pulls you right into the world of legal battles, this one's a fantastic choice.

### The Rainmaker by John Grisham: A Deep Dive

**A Quick Overview (No Spoilers, I Promise!)**
*The Rainmaker* tells the story of Rudy Baylor, a fresh-faced law school graduate, who finds himself without a job in a tough market. He stumbles into his first big case: representing a low-income family against a massive, corrupt insurance corporation that denied their son's life-saving cancer treatment. It's a classic underdog tale, where Rudy, with the help of a quirky paralegal, has to navigate the intimidating legal system against powerful, well-funded adversaries. It's less about flashy courtrooms and more about the grit and determination it takes to fight for justice when the odds are stacked against you.

**What Really Stood Out For Me**

*   **Characters You Root For:** Rudy Baylor is just so relatable. He's not a superhero; he's inexperienced, a bit naive, and sometimes scared, but his sense of justice and compassion shines through. You feel his frustrations and celebrate his small victories. His mentor-like figure, Deck Shifflet, adds a great layer of cynical wisdom and humor that really balances Rudy's earnestness.
*   **Grisham's Signature Style:** The writing is just so clear and engaging. Grisham has a knack for making complex legal procedures understandable without dumbing them down. The pacing is fantastic, too – it keeps you turning pages, eager to see what happens next. There’s a constant sense of tension and urgency that makes it hard to put down.
*   **The Emotional Punch:** This book really makes you *feel*. The injustice faced by Rudy's clients is palpable, and you get genuinely invested in their fight. It highlights the human cost of corporate greed and reminds you why individual integrity matters, even when facing a behemoth.

**A Balanced Perspective**

While I genuinely loved *The Rainmaker*, I'll offer a minor point of consideration. For some readers, particularly those completely new to legal thrillers, the sheer volume of legal setup and details in the beginning might feel a little dense. However, Grisham is an expert at weaving this into the narrative, making it digestible and crucial to the story. It never truly detracts from the overall enjoyment, but it's something to be aware of if you're not usually one for courtroom dramas.

**Do I Recommend It? Absolutely!**

Yes, without a doubt! I highly recommend *The Rainmaker*. It's a classic for a reason.

*   **Who is it best for?** This book is perfect for anyone who enjoys legal thrillers, stories about underdogs fighting the system, or just a really well-crafted, engaging narrative. If you're a new reader looking to dive into a genre that will keep you hooked, this is an excellent starting point. It offers a great blend of suspense, character development, and social commentary. You can find your own copy here: [The Rainmaker – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-rainmaker-john-grisham/).

### Tips for New Readers (or anyone looking for a fresh start!)

If you're just getting into reading, or trying to pick up the habit again, here are a few friendly tips:

*   **Step 1: Pick What Excites You.** Don't feel pressured to read ""classics"" or what everyone else is reading. Find a topic or a genre that genuinely interests you. If dragons and magic are your thing, go for it! If you love a good mystery, grab one!
*   **Step 2: It's Okay to Quit.** If a book isn't grabbing you after a few chapters, it's perfectly fine to put it down and pick up something else. Reading should be enjoyable, not a chore.
*   **Step 3: Little by Little.** You don't need to read for hours. Try 15-20 minutes a day. Before bed, during your commute, or with your morning coffee. Those small increments add up!
*   **Step 4: Don't Sweat Every Word.** You don't need to look up every unfamiliar word. Context often helps, and sometimes it's okay to just keep going and get the gist. The main goal is to enjoy the story.
*   **Step 5: Find Your Happy Place.** Create a comfortable reading nook – a favorite chair, a quiet corner, or even just a park bench. A relaxing environment can make a big difference.

**A Little Motivation:**
Reading is a wonderful journey, opening up new worlds and perspectives. Don't worry about how fast you read or how many books you finish. Every page is a step forward. Just enjoy the process and let the stories take you away. If you're ready to start your next adventure, consider picking up [The Rainmaker – John Grisham](https://pdfhive.com/the-rainmaker-john-grisham/).

1nioron,https://www.reddit.com/r/Aetherearth1953/comments/1nioron/nice/,N.I.C.E.,"They found the poster wedged behind a cracked pane of safety glass in a tube-station that smelled like oil and old rain. Red-orange, worn soft at the corners, the human glyphs were simple enough for a first-year archivist to parse: NICE in huge letters, and beneath that a promise—To Our Destiny Through Science! An atom diagram wrapped around a stylized human, its loops like the petals of a danger flower.

Seeker-Third felt the chorus of the Consensus lean forward inside his skull, a pressure of attention that made the air taste like copper. *Archive. Translate. Contextualize,* they sang, their many voices braided into smooth command. He obliged. His language pads unfurled into the wet wind, tasted the paint, mapped the fading. A public declaration. Repetition count high. Distribution wide. An emblem of governance.

“Humans announced their scientific consolidation openly,” Seeker-Third said aloud, speaking for the record, for the ship, for the millions listening along the light-thread from orbit. “They call it the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments. Abbreviated NICE. Persuasive message: unity through rational method. We may proceed under cooperative doctrine.”

A few of the ground team clicked their mouth-plates in agreement. Cooperative doctrine was elegant—arrive bearing mirrors and tools, align your frameworks with theirs, offer exchange. No need to waste kinetic. No need to embroil yourselves in local tragedies when the natives already believed in coordination. It was good. It was…nice.

Seeker-Third cataloged that linguistic coincidence with private amusement. Humans had a habit of tying meanings together like ropes knotted from mismatched fibers. You could pull on one end of a phrase and drag three centuries along with it.

The station hall lay silent—mosaics of shattered glass, a trash can scabbed with old stickers that read KEEP CALM, another that read NO GODS, NO MASTERS, another: WHERE’S MY FLYING CAR? The city above was not dead, exactly; its grid hummed, its towers still gestured at the sky, but the avenues were ghostly, as if the people had decided to exist elsewhere for the day. Their satellites were awake though, and their networks were talking. Seeker-Third could hear them as one hears a crowd through walls. He caught snatches of anthem and algorithm, propaganda and playlist. One frequency murmured a human reading from a book, cadence even, like a priest delivering weather.

The ground team brought up a map of known government sites with overlays for hazards, legends, myth-nodes. At the center of three crosshatched zones sat the NICE primary campus. Belbury.

“Recommend approach,” Seeker-Third said.

“Recommend caution,” hissed Scribe-Ninth, whose carapace was scarred by a collision with a Jovian tug during a previous mission. “Their patterns are not neat.”

“Caution is cooperative,” the Consensus sang.

They went by crawler, slow on electro-muscle legs, through streets whose names were poetry even when chopped into syllables: Magdalene Bridge, Holywell, Jericho. Seeker-Third transmitted greetings in all the languages his pads had collected, and the city broadcast back a flurry of pop-song jingles and municipal emergency procedures. Drone signage changed color as they passed. A bus depot flashed MASK REQUIRED, then MASK OPTIONAL, then MASKS ARE THEATER as an internal algorithm updated and rolled back on the fly. He logged it without judgment. Civilizations were soups; sometimes they boiled.

The NICE campus was a red-brick labyrinth set well back from the road, fronted by a glass pavilion that still gleamed despite the long neglect. A metal statue stood on the lawn—something muscular, almost human, without a face. Its plaque had been pried off. Seeker-Third took atmosphere readings, ran pathogen checks. In the vestibule, a security turnstile blinked green at their badges, a courtesy their badges did not deserve, and then an old speaker crackled.

“Welcome to the National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments,” said a woman’s voice, thin with decades. “Visitors must report to the front desk.”

Nothing moved.

The front desk had a bell. Scribe-Ninth rang it because ritual mattered. On the wall: photographs of groundbreakings and ribbon-cuttings, handshakes and smiles. Two faces repeated across the years—one round and beaming, one narrow and hungry. Seeker-Third cross-referenced them against facial records: directors, funders, mid-century politicians whose names had been filed under MALIGN by several hostile human factions and NECESSARY by others. Humans did not agree on their own heroes.

He leaned over the counter and found a book, not electronic but paper. Guest names flowed like river silt—wobbling ballpoint signatures, births and deaths compressed into loops and slashes. Between two entries from fifty years ago someone had written in pencil: NOT NICE.

Seeker-Third logged the graffiti as an example of local humor, hostile variant.

They searched the campus. Laboratories: pristine, sealed, and stripped. A lecture hall: seats bolted to tiered floors, chalk scribblings fossilized into the slate. A cafeteria where fern-green tiles had bubbled away from the walls like old paint on a ship. In a basement archive, humidity swelled the paper until entire shelves felt like bread. The index listed categories: *Anthropoid Behavior.* *Macro-Experimentation.* *The Objective Universe.* *The Re-Education of Man.* The covers of their pamphlets shone with optimism. Inside, language hardened.

“Instruction: contact local administrators,” the Consensus sang.

“We lack a human to greet,” Seeker-Third said. “But the poster suggests we will be greeted.”

Scribe-Ninth pressed a console button and a video blinked to life—a man with eyes like dull coins speaking into a camera. “At NICE,” he said, “we believe the human experiment must be shepherded. Old superstitions must yield to coordinated, scientific policy. We will get out of man what is in man to get.” He smiled at his own slogan. “We will be NICE.”

“And when will this be broadcast?” Scribe-Ninth asked.

“The file timestamp reads very old,” Seeker-Third said. “But the city still echoes with echoes. The message persists.”

They stayed long enough for rain to happen and stop. In the afternoon, a human came.

She arrived alone in a rusted buggy with three different tires and a window that would not quite go up. She wore a coat like a blanket and a scarf like a flag. She saw their crawler and their plates and their not-quite-faces and she closed her eyes for a time that suggested prayer or swearing or both. Then she got out and walked up the steps as if stairs had always been the place where fate found her.

Seeker-Third inclined his head, a gesture they had practiced to avoid spooking bipeds. “Welcome to the National Institute for—”

“Don’t,” she said.

Scribe-Ninth clicked a question into the team channel—predatory? panicked?—but her posture was steady. She pointed at the poster in the vestibule, at the worn shouting word, at the atom that had been a flower. “You found one,” she said. “Long way from home to pick up bad memes.”

“We are not here to steal anything,” Seeker-Third said. “We are here to trade. Your society values coordination; our society is coordination. The poster—”

“—is a lie,” she said. “Well, not a lie; humans don’t do clean lies. It’s a story meant to drag other stories in its wake. You see destiny and science and think that’s enough like you to risk a handshake. We see a brand, a con, a cheap suit on a monster. What did you think NICE was?”

“National Institute for Co-ordinated Experiments,” he said. “Scientific governance.”

She snorted without malice. “That’s the pitch. The acronym was the lure. It sounds like something your aunt says about your haircut. That’s what made it work. But this place was a front from the start. You read C. S. Lewis?”

The name pinged seven directions in Seeker-Third’s pads: a novelist, a scholar, a man whose deathdate aligned with the going-out of a star. “We sampled his texts,” he said.

“He wrote a book about NICE—*That Hideous Strength.* He spelled it out. People still walked in. Because being told a story is not the same as learning. Because power is good at smiling.” She looked past them down the empty hall. The absence of people sat in her like a weight she’d chosen to carry. “Anyway. My name is Miriam. I’m here because you’re here, and because if you believe that poster you’ll walk straight into some other smiling thing, something newer than these old bricks, and you’ll make a bad bargain that lasts a century.”

Scribe-Ninth eased her posture. “You come as a…cautionary device.”

“I came with a thermos and a friend watching the hill with binoculars who will run if you look at him,” Miriam said. “I came because I remember how my father talked about museums: you go, you read the big placards, you think you’ve got it, and you leave not knowing you saw loot. We are very good at museums. And at placards.”

“Then tell me what the placard is hiding,” Seeker-Third said.

In the cafeteria, they took a table by the window where a thin pear tree tried to be fruit. Miriam poured tea that smelled of electricity and a plant Seeker-Third’s pads could not identify. He watched her hands, the small burns and the thin white snake of a scar, while the Consensus murmured inside his skull with the dorm-room curiosity of a million first-year students.

“When I was twelve,” Miriam said, “my school made us memorize the Preamble to the Constitution. It sounded like math. *We the People…in Order to form a more perfect Union…*—clean, declarative, like a theorem. Then you grow up and learn it’s poetry, not math, and people use it on each other like a stick. That’s a thing about humans. A beautiful order can be a knife.”

“We have knives,” Scribe-Ninth said dryly. “We assume knives. We accounted for knives.”

“Good,” Miriam said. “NICE used knives that looked like chairs. You know the difference?” She sipped. “In Lewis’s book, NICE wanted power for the sake of power dressed up as progress. The irony is that the book turned into an inoculation and a curse: it taught some of us to smell the lie, but it also taught those who wanted that kind of power to be subtler. The poster is from some fan of irony, or a marketing intern who thought midcentury retro would move units. Truth is, we’ve had a hundred NICEs since. Some were communes, some were corporations, some were ministries with names like ‘Happiness’ or ‘Efficiency’ or ‘Reform.’ We specialize in double-speak. The trick is: we also specialize in noticing it.”

Seeker-Third let the tea heat his palms and filed the words like specimens pinned in a museum that was not loot. “We saw cities without people,” he said softly.

“We’re tired,” Miriam said. “Or we’re working elsewhere. A lot of us are hiding from our own acronyms. You come from a consensus? Must be nice.”

“NICE,” Scribe-Ninth murmured, and Miriam’s face went sideways with a smile that had been left out in the rain.

Seeker-Third listened to the chorus arguing in his skull: the advocates for cooperation in whisper-war with the skeptics. The chorus wanted a clean read; instead they had Miriam, messy and tea-scented, offering a caution in the shape of a story. “If NICE is a warning, what do you want us to understand?” he asked.

“That you can’t parse us on slogans,” she said. “You can count our satellites and measure our emissions and read our laws, and you’ll still miss the thing that makes us us. We talk back to our gods. We heckle our tyrants. We stage mutinies during lifeboat drill. We tell jokes at funerals that make the dead sit up inside the living. When something arrives that says, ‘I am progress and I will coordinate you,’ some of us will clap and some will build bombs, and somewhere a twelve-year-old will paste NOT NICE under every poster in town until her hands smell like paste for a week.”

The chorus wanted proofs. The chorus wanted safer examples. Seeker-Third wanted to hear the rest. “And if we offered you genuine cooperation?” he asked. “Actual exchange? Tools and medicine for knowledge and soil?”

“I’m a librarian,” Miriam said, with a shrug that was also a creed. “We like exchange. But not with a front. Not through a brand. If your people come down wearing shirts that read COOPERATION we’ll make songs about you and half will be mean. Come down with names instead, and questions. We like questions.” She glanced at the atom-flower poster still showing through the vestibule. “And bring people who’ve read our books.”

“We read,” Seeker-Third said, a little wounded, because he had loved a stranger’s poem on the transit from Uranus’s dark and felt like that should count. “We read on approach.”

“Then read this,” Miriam said, and reached into her bag. The book she handed him had frayed threads and a library stamp from a town whose tax base had vanished. *That Hideous Strength,* in font that remembered cigarette smoke. “Keep it. I can get another.”

He took it like a gift. The chorus muttered in annoyance at all the paper coming into the crawler. He muted them.

“Why help us, if you don’t trust us?” Scribe-Ninth asked, direct.

“Because if you’re as coordinated as you say you are, you’re an easy mark for our better monsters,” she said simply. “They love consensus. They’ll sell you harmonies and take your bones. But you—” She eyed Seeker-Third as if measuring a cut of cloth. “You have the face of a kid who would doodle in the margins of a holy book. That might save you.”

They walked the campus again, this time with Miriam narrating the absences. “Here,” she said, in a lab where machines had once ticked. “This is where they told themselves objectivity meant no one was allowed to cry. Here,” in a dormitory with cots lined up like teeth, “this is where they told their recruits sleep is weakness. Here,” in the lecture hall, “this is where they said the old prayers with the words swapped out: instead of *Deliver us from evil* they said *Deliver us from mess.* The world is mess. You try to clean it down to bone and you’ll get horror.”

“Mess is a thing we do not like,” said Scribe-Ninth.

“Learn,” Miriam said. “Or you’ll end up doing to us what we do to ourselves when we forget we’re noisy animals who write sonnets.”

The wind picked up again. The sky went to pewter. She stayed until the cold made her fingers ache. “I have to go,” she said. “There’s a clinic where the roof leaks. We’ve got a bucket ballet. Bring your doctors to places like that and not to campuses with posters, and we’ll call you something better than NICE.” She paused, then dug into her bag once more and pulled out a different pamphlet, one printed last month by the look of it. The cover said in blue letters: Better Tomorrow Initiative. “This one’s current. This is the new smile. Learn its teeth.”

Seeker-Third took it too, and thought about a species that could see itself so clearly and still walk into mirrors.

“May I ask you a question?” he said, as she turned toward the door.

“Ask two,” she replied, generous.

“You said we talk back to gods. What happens when the gods talk back?”

“We tell them to be better,” Miriam said, as if it were the most obvious thing in the world. “Or we lie down and die; both happen. My people are a chorus too, but we don’t always sing the same song. That’s…well, that’s us.”

“And the second: why did you come alone?”

“I didn’t,” she said. “My friend’s on the hill. And you’re all in your head all the time with your Consensus. Alone is a story we tell each other to feel brave. It’s not true most days.”

She left. The buggy coughed itself awake, complained down the road, and tuned into a station that was playing a love song as if love were a machine that could be started with diesel.

Seeker-Third sat with *That Hideous Strength* open on his lap while the chorus conducted their own emergency seminar. They quoted policy at one another, debated K-strategy and r-strategy for contact, produced graphs and amended graphs. He did not mute them; he let the noise go through him. He read slowly, lips moving, like a child who had not yet learned that the mind could swallow words without chewing. The book made him angry and then ashamed and then, unexpectedly, relieved. It was not about them, not really; it was about humans talking to themselves across time, handing down a warning in brown paper and hope. The warning was not that science is wicked. The warning was that power will use any tool, and the tool becomes the face.

The chorus reached no consensus. That, too, was a first.

“Instruction: defer contact,” they sang at last, holding their notes like glass. “Seek messy places. Avoid brands. Request volunteers.”

Seeker-Third closed the book, feeling the weight of it as if paper could be gravity. “Messy places,” he echoed. “Clinics with buckets.”

He found Miriam two days later under a roof that funneled rain into a row of pots that went plink in complicated rhythms. Her scarf was now an oil rag. Her hands were wet to the wrists. She was laughing with a man whose laugh was a series of wheezes like an old accordion. Seeker-Third stood in the door until she saw him, then he held up a bag. She opened it and took out gauze and seals and tiny heaters in smooth white cases.

“You read?” she asked.

“Twice,” he said. “And I listened. We will not be NICE.”

“You never were,” she said, and some tension went out of her shoulders as if she had been braced for a different answer and was relieved not to receive it. “What will you be?”

“Seeker-Third,” he said. “And Scribe-Ninth. And the others. We will come with names and questions. We will bring the wrong tools, and you will tell us why they are wrong, and we will argue and then laugh. We will practice not speaking in placards.”

“And your bosses?”

“The chorus has opinions,” he said delicately.

“They always do,” she said. “Pull up a bucket.”

He did. The clinic smelled like bleach and onion soup and a dog who had decided to love everyone in turn. A woman in a paper gown breathed through a problem. A child counted ceiling cracks. Two elders held hands like sailors. Scribe-Ninth calibrated the heaters to match human skin expectations. Seeker-Third watched Miriam instruct a teenager on proper bandaging language—*You are allowed to say it hurts.* He donated a roll of tape that could seal a breach on a cargo hull and learned that on earth, you needed tape that could be torn with teeth. He added TEETH TAPE to the procurement list and felt proud of the specificity of it.

“Why do you like us?” Miriam asked him later, tired but not unkind.

“I never said I do,” Seeker-Third said, and then realized it was untrue. “Because you argue as if the argument were the point. Because you make songs out of warning posters. Because your acronyms mean three things at once and one of them is always a joke you are making about yourself. Because when the city puts up a sign that says DESTINY THROUGH SCIENCE you make another sign that says DESTINY THROUGH SOUP and you mean it.”

She grinned around cup noodles. “Soup is political.”

“So is tape,” he said, and thought of knives and chairs.

They built a rhythm. The crawler added the clinic to its route, then added a school with a roof like a sail, then a library kept alive by a woman whose glasses reflected the entire galaxy when she looked up. Seeker-Third brought medkits and got back books with coffee stains. Scribe-Ninth showed three kids how to make a water filter out of a jar and some sand and a scrap of mesh that used to be part of a spaceship. In exchange, a boy with a shaved head showed Scribe-Ninth how to skip stones in a drainage ditch, which turns out to be like tuning a resonator—angle, force, intention. The boy named a stone Minister of Finance and laughed when it sank.

The Consensus adjusted in increments, like an orchestra warming up. Some remained suspicious; some sang hymns to the new doctrine of messy help; some opened a sub-chorus dedicated entirely to human joke-study. It was work. It was slower than brand deployment. It did not look good on maps. But on a rain-clear morning when the sky above Belbury went the kind of blue that hurts, Miriam handed Seeker-Third a new poster. It was hand-painted, brush strokes visible, letters a little unsteady.

It read: N.I.C.E.

And beneath it, smaller, almost shy: Not Interested in Coordinating Everything.

He barked a laugh he had not known his species could make. “Am I allowed to put this in a museum?”

“Only if you call it loot,” Miriam said.

He pinned the poster on the clinic wall above the buckets. People came and went under it, wet hair and weary smiles. The dog chose a new person to love every hour. The kettle steamed like an engine smaller than destiny and bigger than a slogan. Seeker-Third imagined the chorus seeing the poster through his eyes, and he felt the press of their attention shift, soften, wonder.

On the day a convoy from the Better Tomorrow Initiative rolled through town with banners and boxed solutions, slick and straight and sexy as a knife that insisted it was a chair, Seeker-Third stood on the steps with Miriam and watched the caravan shine. He read the rhetoric the way she had taught him, labeling the tricks. He felt the pull—efficiency always pulled—and then he looked at the clinic buckets, the soup line, the teenagers arguing about whether it counted as cheating to tape a car mirror back with alien resin that would hold until the sun burned down.

He leaned toward Miriam. “We could challenge them,” he said. “We could prove our method superior with demonstrations and papers.”

She sipped from her thermos. “Or we could keep the door open. They’ll knock. They always do, when the leak comes through the roof.”

They did. Two months later, one of the Better Tomorrow engineers came in with wet hair and a face like someone who had been told to be useful and had run out of nouns. She looked up at the hand-painted poster and smiled the way a person smiles when they see their own name in casual conversation. She rolled up her sleeves.

“Teach me your buckets,” she said.

Seeker-Third nodded toward the tape. “And our teeth.”

That night, in the close dark of the crawler, with the Consensus murmuring about procurement lists and the ethics of joke dissemination, Seeker-Third opened *That Hideous Strength* again. He read the chapter where the institute cracked and the human world refused to be tidied. He turned the page with fingers that still smelled of soup and adhesive and pear tree. He thought about the aliens they had been when they landed—sure of clean lines and scientific coordination, grateful to find a poster that told them what to think. He thought about the aliens they were becoming—willing to put their hands in the bucket ballet, to read a book that called their kind of thinking dangerous when it forgot to love mess.

The chorus touched him with a thousand careful hands. *We are listening,* they sang, not quite a whisper, not quite a prayer.

He slept under a poster that said Not Interested in Coordinating Everything and dreamed of a universe where cooperation looked like two people holding the same leaking roof over a room full of laughing.

In the morning, when the sun came up like a flashlight found in a drawer and switched on with a dignified click, Miriam met him at the steps with a clipboard and an impossible to-do list.

“Welcome to the Institute,” she said, deadpan.

He saluted with a strip of teeth tape. “We are not NICE.”

“You’re learning,” she said, and they both meant it.",1,1758045577.0,Aetherearth1953,0,1.0,False
1nior1a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nior1a,Looks like the dev settled on the faster generating shitty AI model.,"Before I start. Keep in mind that this is a free website that's being hosted by a single person for many people to use. This is not supposed to be a complaint.

Now about the new model.
Like seen in the pics I posted, it always generates almost the same exact generic response with every regen.
Deleting a portion of the text and regenerating it will almost always generate the same exact text or a slightly different one that's as close and generic to it as the last one.
This model is barely an upgrade over the old one and unusable for me.
The dev was testing a slower model that had contextual awareness, much more creative output, always giving different results with every regen even when deleting only a portion of the text and was giving the most creative responses with the simplest instructions while sticking to the context of the events in the story.
I just wished that the dev would engage with the community and tell us about what the other model was and why he decided against using it instead of what we have right now.
I am checking from time to time to see if the model had any changes but my experience is the same since 3-4 days.",0,1758045537.0,perchance,0,0.33,False

From the moment I saw her, I was automatically interested. An average person sees at least 40 different unique faces a day sometimes more sometimes less but there’s not one single person that you walk by that you just stare at that you actually try and have a conversation with, you Just walk on by and don’t pay any attention to them. You don’t know how their life is. You don’t know their name and with just a glance, you don’t even know their eyecolor. I don’t know the first time I saw her. I may have seen her 30 times before I even noticed but she’s different. I don’t know what it is about her, but she shows up everywhere I go and the thing is I expect to see her everywhere I go. I started noticing her five days ago. I went into the downtown Manhattan coffee shop that I always go to and I ordered the same exact thing that I got every single time cold foam extra ice, whipped cream and half a cinnamon roll. It’s not what I needed, but I felt like I needed it. It was part of my daily routine. I look over after I sit down see a blonde haired girl sitting across the coffee shop in the window seat, staring out into the cold wet morning that downtown Manhattan always seem to have. I looked at her for a second but then I started looking around the coffee shop. I already knew what I had to bring. Fact I knew the owner, Joe, he loved me. I’d been going to this coffee shop ever since I moved here a year ago, this coffee shop isn’t too far away from where I live. I live on Bender Road still in downtown. But after I looked around for a little while, I looked back at the girl I kept stumbling upon her like I don’t know. I was drawn to look at her. I don’t know what it was, but I felt something special about her. now obviously there’s lots of people in Manhattan so of course I went along with my day. I did the same thing about every day after Joe’s I go to my job. I don’t have a car because traffic here is insane and the bikers here do not know how to stay in their own lane so I walk everywhere and if I do say so myself, my legs are pretty in shape But enough about that. I work at a place called vendor music shop. It’s on the same road that I live on and it’s nothing special but to me it feels like my second home, feels like I’m always there yet never there at the same time it pays pretty good And I love my boss which really I have everything I could ask for I get paid 50 a day which leads me to get $18,250 a year, i’m not saving up for anything special fact i  really have everything I need. I put all the money that I get into bills and I’ve only been working here for a couple months. It’s not like I have a bunch of money but like I said it pays good. It’s on my street and it’s in walking distance from my apartment my apartment is decent. It’s small but for one person it doesn’t need to be big. My landlord is OK. He’s not the best but he keeps dirty people out of the building so I don’t really have to worry about my neighbors being all crazy as much. I’m never late on payments or anything. Something about him just seems off to me, I don’t know. I like the place that I’m in. I really do it just seems like my life is a little bit boring until I saw her again not for a while, but she walked past the music shop. I didn’t do anything about it, but there was this tiny part of me that hoped I would see her again. I don’t know what it was or why, but it was there. After my shift was over. It was around 4:18 PM. I had just closed and my boss had left about an hour ago and not too many people work at the music shop me (David), Joey and autumn, and of course, Vaughan the boss. We mostly all take shifts, autumn has dance practice on Thursdays and Fridays. Joey is a drunky surprised Vaughan is even letting him work here, he’s always on the back up schedule if one of us can’t come in, which means I don’t see him a lot. And Vaughan is always at the music shop unless he has something to do.
After I close up I go to my house usually if I don’t go to my house, I’ll go to The battery, a park I’ve gone to ever since I moved there’s always something new to look at in that park and I’ll just sit there until I get tired. I was sitting on a bench looking at one of the statues when I saw her once again it feels like every time I see her she catches my eye somehow like no one else does… I see so many faces in one day in the city I mean the city is huge but this girl it’s like no matter what I’m doing. I’ll always look over to see her. It’s been like that for the past five days I mean, I’ll just catch her walking around. I don’t know what her story is. I don’t know her past. I don’t know her schedule in a day, but I see her, sometimes it’ll be one time others It may be up to six times but like I said, she always catches my eye and she’s never even looked at me, not while I’ve looked at her at least. I feel like I’m going crazy. I mean she’s got this style that seems so preposterous. It’s like a vintage look with new pieces. I don’t know how to explain it and I’m not a humongous fashion guy or anything. I just know the trends, but this girl she doesn’t go by trends you could tell I’m seriously about to start mapping out her path because there are sometimes where I’ll go somewhere and I don’t see her at all, but then another time where I go somewhere else and I’ll see her at least twice. She’s got kind of dirty blonde hair now that I’ve seen it so much Brown eyes soft smile she wears mascara, dark purple gray eyeshadow and she’s got freckles. I don’t wanna sound like a creep like a weirdo who’s watching some girl, I’m not like that. It’s just she’s always there. I don’t know what I’m even talking about anymore. It’s 12 o’clock and I’m sleep deprived. I haven’t been able to sleep for the past two nights bunch of stuff has been on my mind. I won’t go into detail, but for now I’m gonna try to get some sleep.

1niop81,https://www.reddit.com/r/IndianStockMarket/comments/1niop81/the_best_investment_i_made_in_years/,The best investment I made in years,"Nearly a month ago I left for Goa again. I had never planned such a long trip in my life. Usually, it’s short breaks and then back to the same routine. This time, I just booked a ticket and left with no plan.

The first couple of days felt odd. Sitting in a shack alone, phone buzzing with market updates that I ignored. I watched people dance and laugh while I just sat there. It felt strange but freeing at the same time.

Slowly, the days turned into a simple pattern. Coffee in the morning, watching the sea. Long aimless walks. Evenings where I just sat with strangers around, but no need to talk. The silence made me uncomfortable at first, but then it started to feel like something I had been missing.

A lot of my old thoughts returned. The instrument I always wanted to learn but never touched. Trips I had postponed again and again. Books I bought but never read. Conversations I wanted to have but kept delaying. The idea of maybe one day living in a place where I don’t have to think about money at all, just about small things like breakfast, or how to spend the evening.

Btw, I don’t mean the whole “YOLO” nonsense. That’s stupid. I just mean slowing down enough to do the things I once promised myself I would.

There is nothing wrong with my life, but for the first time, I understood what it feels like to stop chasing and just live. I know I am on the right track towards my goals, but I keep feeling like I haven’t achieved enough yet. Maybe that’s the trap. If you are doing the right things and moving steadily towards your goals, that itself is being there. We need to stop saying “I’ll live after I achieve it” and start living alongside the journey.

When I came back to Mumbai, I knew this trip was the best investment I have made in years. We keep saying we invest for freedom and for the long term. But most of us never use it in the present.

If you have read so far, my best wishes to you. Markets compound money. Life compounds in moments like these.",2,1758045429.0,IndianStockMarket,2,0.67,False
1nioofl,https://www.reddit.com/r/normancrane/comments/1nioofl/a_perfect_day_for_naturafish/,A Perfect Day for Naturafish,"There was me, my sister, my mom, my dad and my grandparents on my mom's side in the small unit in the prefab apartment block on Bandaya Street in the capital. And, this morning, there was also you, visiting from overseas.

I still can't believe you got a visa.

They're very hard to get. 

But I'm so happy you're here, that I get to show you a little of my life here.

Right now, it's just past 06:30 and everyone but the sun and my sister are up. She's always been a late riser, but she'll get up eventually, and she'll be sharp as a tack right away. I'm more like my dad, up with the alarm clock but not really awake until a half-hour later.

He's shaving. I bet he nicks himself.

And mom and grandma are in the kitchen, making breakfast with whatever we managed to get yesterday. I'd absolutely kill for an egg, but what they're making does smell good.

Coffee?

Sometimes. Other times we get by on roasted barley with chicory.

My grandpa told us how, during the war, they'd make tea by steeping black, burnt bread crusts in water until the water turned brown. I'm so glad we don't have to do that anymore. We have real tea sometimes now.

Anyway, let's have a bite to eat, and then I'll show you what our days are like.

Sit anywhere you like. It's a small table, but we'll all fit. You're probably not used to tight spaces like these. You do get used to it. I've been living here almost my whole life. My parents were allocated this unit after my sister was born and we met the minimum family replacement size. No, we can't sell it, but it's ours until we don't need it anymore. Everyone of value gets a place to live.

“I'll wait for meat today,” mom says.

Grandma's staying home. Grandpa will try to get butter and milk. “What about you, dad?”

“Nails. Maybe soap.”

And my sister will get bread.

As for us, we'll try to get something special, a rarity. I'm off from school today so it's a “free” day for me. Whatever we get is a bonus.

OK, let's head out.

It's a nice day but you should probably take a jacket. It rains here out of the blue sometimes.

We go out of the unit, down the stairs because the elevator doesn't work, then out of the apartment block. There's a metal playground on the left, but it's empty of children because it's a school day. Surrounding us are generally more buildings identical to the one I live in, and then an exit toward the road. Few cars go by. Instead, most people are on foot, lined up on the sidewalk going both directions.

We join.

“What's that way?” I ask, pointing south.

“Fruit, coal and herring,” somebody says without looking at us. “Or so I hear.”

“And north?”

“Chocolate. That's what I always hope for. Maybe one day. I had chocolate once, a decade ago…”

“So these people don't know what they’re lining up for?” you ask me.

“Usually they have some idea, but not always. But there's always something at the start of a lineup. Otherwise people wouldn't line up.”

“How do they have time to just stand there?”

“Most of them don't work. The government is very efficient, so only the ones who need to work, work. The ones good at what they're doing. Everybody else, the normal people, we line up to get what the government provides. I know it's very different from the system you're used to.”

We stand in the line going north.

Slowly, we move.

Eventually, about an hour later, we come to an intersection. The roads are still empty, save for the odd black car every once in a while, which honks and whom we make way for, so our lineup crosses the intersection at a diagonal, intersecting at one point with a line going a different direction.

“Keep right for chocolate?” I ask.

“Chocolate? This is the queue for vodka and beets,” says an elderly man.

“And the other one?”

He looks at me, at you. “Refrigerator sign-ups.”

“If you want chocolate, there's a rumour they're giving it out on Potomskaya Street,” someone yells from within one of the two lineups.

“Wishful thinking!” yells another.

We merge into the other lineup and continue, passing people on the right when we can. Some give us dirty looks. Others smile at us because we're young and have so much ahead of us. “Sorry, we're not queuing here. We're just trying to get through,” I offer repeatedly as an explanation.

“Where are we going?” you ask me, as I pull you along. Although this is all so mundane, I'm exhilarated that I get to share it with you. 

“To where the chocolate might be,” I say.

“What if there is no chocolate?”

“Then it'll be like every other day.” But I hope it's not. It can't be. Not with you here.

On the left, we pass a row of makeshift tents, people getting in and out of them. You ask who they are, and I explain that they're prospectors, citizens who attempt to predict the routes of future queues to be able to get a head start on them. “They sleep here?”

“Yes.”

By the time we reach the vicinity of Potomskaya Street, we hear engines and music, and I remember suddenly there's a foreign delegation in the city today, but before I can explain, a police officer stops us.

“Papers,” he says.

I pull mine out, and show him your passport and visa too. He examines the documents closely before handing them back. “Do you have non-queue travel permits?”

“As a student, I'm allowed—”

“Fine, yes.”

“Do you want to see my school identification card?”

“No,” he says. “That's fine.”

“Would it be possible to maybe get close enough to the delegation to take a look?” I ask. “My guest, she is in our country for the first time.”

“As long as you don't get too close,” he says, then drops his voice to a whisper: “And if you take Glory to the Revolution Pedestrian Overpass across to where the municipal district is, they're giving out Naturafish. Special token. Get one for your lady.”

I'm about to protest that I don't have a special token, I'm not from a well placed family, when I feel his hand touch mine and a token pressed into it “Thank you,” I whisper.

“Remember something. Life is beautiful, and it's a perfect day for Naturafish.”

I thank him again clandestinely and we head toward a hill from which we can see a bend in Potomskaya Street, and the foreign delegation being welcomed. The street is lined with people waving flags.

“So many people,” you say.

“Yes, to make a good impression. But they're not normal people. They're actors from the state acting academies. They're playing real people. Look—” I point, and you put your hand above your eyes to block out the sun. “—there's the actor playing me. Do you see?”

“I think so, but he looks nothing like you,” you say.

“There's probably an actress playing you too. They're always on top of who's here and who isn't, and I'm sure the foreign delegation would be honoured to meet you, by which I mean the actress playing you.”

“What do you think I'll say?”

“That you are impressed by the economic development of the country, the cleanliness of its public spaces, and the increase of its agricultural output.”

You smile, and I smile too. “But I'm sure she'll be nowhere near as pretty as you,” I say.

We walk down the hill hand in hand and join another lineup. Ahead, holding a small radio to his ear, a bearded man calls out, “Sixty fourth minute and still nil-nil, but the Uruguayans are fouling our boys like animals. Brutal tactics. They couldn't cope with our speed otherwise. Oh, what's this? A red card for Uruguay's captain and a free kick to us at the edge of the penalty area. Could this be the breakthrough?”

“That's Platonov,” I explain. “He's something of a folk hero around here. He used to be a very good footballer, before his injury.”

“I didn't know there were any matches going on right now,” you say.

“There aren't. Our team has been banned from international competitions by the governing bodies."" You notice that the radio isn't emitting any sound. “Platonov merely pretends to listen to a real football broadcast, and relates to us what he pretends, and we follow along. Even the newspapers report on what he pretends. Today, it's our second group match of the World Cup. We're in a group with Uruguay, Cameroon and the Netherlands. And once this World Cup is over in a few weeks, Platonov will pretend another into existence, and so on, so there's always a World Cup going on. In some ways, it's better than the real thing. We don't always win. In fact, we haven't even made the final since February of last year.”

“Why does he do it?”

“For the love of sport and his fellow man.”

“Goooaaalll!” Platonov yells. “What a strike, straight into the upper left corner. Sanchez-Lobos didn't stand a chance. We're ahead. Twenty-two minutes left. Can we hang on? A win would set us up perfectly for the final matchday, but even a draw will do. Come on, boys! Come on!”

Everyone in the lineup cheers, including me and you, and you lean against my shoulder.

The lineups wriggle forward like snakes, crossing, merging, intertwining and forking, splitting apart, like veins across the city. The people in them talk and laugh and commiserate. “How are you?” “My husband's sick again.” “It could be worse: you could be sick.” “My children are hungry.” “Whose aren't?” “Can you hold my place in line?” “Yes, sure.” “I'm waiting on medical results.” “So you're healthy at least until then.” “My washing machine broke again.” “It was a Sovpral. It did you a favour.” “We've no hot water in our building.” “The electricity goes out every day after fourteen o'clock, but you can come over and boil some to bathe your baby.”

It's late afternoon by the time we locate the queue the police officer told me about. It's shorter than the others, as all special token queues are. You can tell the individuals in this lineup are more refined, less plain. These are people who have performed services for the motherland.

Around us, the municipal district looks upon us in all its concrete neoclassical grandeur.

“This is a really nice spot,” you say.

“Yes, it cost a lot of money to build. The city was supposed to be governed from here.”

“Supposed?”

“It's abandoned. The buildings are empty, mostly unfinished on the inside. The project was part of a five-year plan, but it wasn't completed in time. The fifth year rolled into a sixth, and the new five-year plan didn't want to finish up the last one's projects. Every five-year plan wants to be independent, its own thing, you know.”

For the first time I'm nervous, feeling the token in my pocket with sweating fingers. What if it's a set-up? The lineup moves quickly, and soon we are the front, in one of the unfinished buildings. Two women, both dressed in grey, sit behind a counter. One holds out her hand as the other says, “Token, please.”

I hand it over.

“Is it true this is the lineup for Naturafish?” I ask.

“Yes,” says the first, handing me a small unmarked tin. I can almost smell what it contains. My eyes fill with tears, but I don't allow myself to cry. Mom and dad, sister, grandma and grandpa will be so pleasantly surprised. “Thank you,” I say, already pulling you by the hand and shuffling to the side so the next person in line may get their tin.

We take our time walking back.

It's already evening.

“What's Naturafish?” you ask softly, still holding my hand. It's a lovely feeling.

“It's a synthetic form of tuna manufactured from soybeans we receive from Brazil under the beneficial terms of our trade agreement.” Because I can see your smile wilt, “It's considered better than the real thing,” I add. “Better tasting, better for the environment, more nutritious and a domestically-made product on top of that. It's something of a point of pride for us, a symbol of what we're capable of as a state.”

We arrive back at the apartment just in time for dinner, which mom is preparing.

She did not succeed in getting any meat and did not want to camp out until morning, but dad managed two bars of soap and two batteries, sister got bread, and grandpa was able to get a bottle of milk but no butter. “Maybe I'll have better luck tomorrow,” he says.

“Butter luck,” you say, and everyone laughs.

The electricity falters then fails, which means the lights suddenly go out, but we have candles. I light them and arrange them across the unit.

The flames flicker in the breeze.

The light is warm.

“I wasn't in the mood for butter anyway,” says dad.

“Me neither,” adds sister.

At the end of the meal, I take out the tin of Naturafish and lay it on the table.

“Is it…”

“Yes,” I say.

In that moment, as I let grandpa open the tin, revealing the flakes of Naturafish inside, I know what you must be thinking. That it's a small tin. In your country, you would probably have one tin per person, and I wonder if you can ever truly understand what life is like here. But then mom passes out the dessert forks that dad and I made  from scrap metal years ago. And as we take turns tasting the Naturafish, talking, laughing, sharing the experiences of our days, I believe you can and do, and it fills me with the greatest joy.

“Does anyone happen to know if we won the match today?” dad asks.

“We were up 1-0 in the sixty-eighth minute,” you say.

“Dirty Uruguayans,” says grandma.

“I'm sure it'll be in the newspaper tomorrow.”

“Does anyone want coffee?”

“I do.”

“Me too.”

“But we've ve nothing to heat the water with,” I say, pointing at the candles.

Grandpa gets up from his chair, crosses to the window and looks out. “It seems they have power a few buildings down. I know a man who lives there, Ivan. I'll get some hot water from him and bring it back.”

“It's really no big deal. You don't have to,” you say.

“Don't be ridiculous,” says grandpa in that way we have of accepting gratitude by being mock aggressive. It means he likes you. 

I like you too.

I may not have much, but what I have I want to share with you. The sun sets. Grandpa returns. The water's no longer hot. Grandpa spent time talking to Ivan, whose daughter is getting married soon. But it's warm, and warm is good enough. Maybe not for real coffee, but for roasted barley and chicory it is, and that's all we have, and we're grateful for that, talking and laughing until bedtime.",3,1758045385.0,normancrane,0,1.0,False

This was to prevent sputtering. After doing this for a while I figured that this was a non-issue. Just close the lid and remove the heat. I also think that the fast temperature change from the cold water could warp the base over time. 

What I do is watch the pot carefully near the end of the cycle, close the lid when the coffee starts streaming fast and remove the heat when I hear the sputtering. I then pour the coffee into a cup right away and place the pot on a thick-folded cotton towel.

I’d love to get your feedback on a project we’ve been working on: **Sorso**, a portable coffee machine that’s **open and modular** (have a look here [www.sorsoofcoffee.it](http://www.sorsoofcoffee.it)).

Right now it’s just a **very primitive first prototype**, still under heavy testing and improvement. It makes espresso already (not moka yet – we’re working on that).

The system is split into three modules:

1. **Heating module** → heats water with 4x 18650 batteries connected to two resistors.
2. **Brewing module** → built with brass tubes soldered together, non-return valves, and even a syringe used as a pump. The pod holder is 3D-printed in PA12.
3. **Storage module** → holds cups and pods. All module shells are 3D-printed in PLA.

We’re presenting it at **Maker Faire Rome in mid-October** as part of a thesis project at Polythecnic University of Turin.

Would love to know:

* What would you improve?
* Would you use it?
* Any wild ideas for next steps?

So a while back I made a post about WhoAmI a free application that I built for people in tech to build a web presence. It's a sort of mix between LinkTree and LinkedIn !

Long story short, so many people signed up and were really positive in the comments and it meant so much to me that I had to keep working on it.

But feelings aside, now there's a new update with some cool features I think you'll enjoy:

**- RSS Feed**

Every profile now has an RSS feed that users can subscribe to. You can see it on my profile at [https://whoami.tech/cfds](https://whoami.tech/cfds) on the posts section.

**- Newsletter feature**

Every public post you create now has a newsletter subscription form as you can see here [https://whoami.tech/cfds/posts/working-on-whoami-s-profile-page](https://whoami.tech/cfds/posts/working-on-whoami-s-profile-page) (you can take the chance to subscribe to my newsletter if you want :P )

When the user subscribes, they receive a confirmation email and once confirmed, the subscription is active. The profile owner you subscribed too can see their number of subscriptions on the dashboard.

Now, once they create a post they have a checkbox to send to the newsletter or not, and if they do, everyone in it receives the new post per email !!

Of course there's a link available to unsubscribee as well :).  
\_\_\_\_

Again the app is free for everyone to USE, I might at some point implement a Buy Me a Coffee button for whoever wants to help cover the cost of the VPS and Domain (like $5) :D, but hopefully it helps some of you !!! I've been so excited and thank you for making me feel special and supporting this project :D.

I would love some very honest feedback !!

Most people on strattera (atomoxetine) report having less hunger not more - but I never saw that effect.

However I stopped eating any kind of dairy which also meant chocolate. After 4 days I basically evolved.

All my lethargy and exhaustion went and incredibly I just stopped craving or even thinking about food.

Before I would dream of the next bite while I was still putting the food in my mouth but almost instantly it completely left me and I began to shed the fat.

The clarity of mind I have now is even greater and the absence of food cravings leaves me with even more quiet mental space. Also coffee does absolutely nothing but make me tired now.

So if you are struggling with food or lethargy, you could try it out too - it only took about 4 days so potentially doable and pretty safe to try.

Here's a breakdown of why Bitcoin might “suck,” depending on your perspective:

# ⚠️ 1. Extreme Volatility

Bitcoin’s price can swing wildly. It’s dropped over **70% during downturns**, which undermines its claim as a stable store of value. If you're looking for predictability, Bitcoin is more rollercoaster than rock.

# 🐋 2. Concentrated Ownership

Over **70% of Bitcoin’s supply is held by a small group of early adopters**—often called “whales.” This means a few players can move markets dramatically, which contradicts the idea of decentralization.

# 🏛️ 3. Regulatory Risk

Governments may crack down on Bitcoin as it grows. Think of how the U.S. banned private gold ownership in 1933—similar actions could target Bitcoin, especially if it threatens fiat systems.

# 🧠 4. Quantum Computing Threat

Bitcoin’s cryptographic security could be vulnerable to future quantum computers. If quantum tech advances fast enough, it could **break Bitcoin’s encryption**, requiring a full network overhaul.

# 🔌 5. Utility Limitations

Despite its fame, Bitcoin isn’t widely used for everyday transactions. High fees and slow processing times make it impractical for buying coffee or groceries compared to traditional payment systems.

# 🧨 6. Environmental Impact

Bitcoin mining consumes massive energy—comparable to entire countries. This raises sustainability concerns, especially as climate awareness grows.

Ci tengo a sottolineare che non sono un esperto di caffè o di specialty coffee. Semplicemente, questo progetto (nonché la mia tesi di laurea) mi sta facendo appassionare molto al mondo del caffè!

So che esistono già prodotti simili (non so come sia la qualità dei caffè perché non ho potuto provarli, ma sicuramente su certi aspetti sono più avanzati rispetto al mio prototipo). Tuttavia io sto cercando di rendere tutto modulare: cambiando un solo modulo si può fare l'espresso, la moka, il caffè filtrato o chissà cosa (è un futuro ancora da scrivere...

Al momento:

* fa l’**espresso** (con cialde ESE)
* farà il caffè tipo **moka** (si spera, ci stiamo lavorando...)

I know there's people that does not choose, but can't sleep because of insomnia, but what about you that just likes that part of the day?

Myself?
Well it's rather interesting or maybe just for me, but there's something so soothing and calm about the night that just eases my thoughts a little bit more, makes me focus more and gives me more energy, something about it feels nice that I can't get in the morning and afternoon, kind of inspiring pr simply it appease the soul.
Poetic in sense (maybe cringe) but it's the reality of it for myself.
I enjoy doing things at night, I suffer from COMBINED ADHD and Bipolar disorder (depression) and that time always has something that heals a little bit, when morning comes it feels off, I feel miserable in the afternoon. At night I can have a cup of coffee and relax, it's more fun, I can enjoy my gaming sessions with friends or by myself, enjoying stories, music, watching videos and more.
I got struck really hard by life for years because of my condition, I am now 29 years old man, and this has kept me from harm because I found since 2017 that there's a time in the whole 24h run that gives my head a chance to be more normal and less stressful, I'm also an introvert, so knowing I don't have to do much than enjoy the silent of the night makes me a glimpse of happiness.

Yesterday I passed PgMP in the first try and less that three months of preparation, :)

The exam was complicated, lots of grammar mistakes in the questions and most of the questions were completely different comparing them with the different online available tests.

Some tips:

- There is no time for reviewing the questions, it is better to spend some time in each question because when you finish the exam, probably you are going to be very tired for reviewing them.

- Do all the different tests you find on the Internet for practising. In the exam you are going to answer questions you have never seen in your life, so it is a good idea to practise without repeating tests. Izenbridge tests were quite similar to the real exam, and Alaa Sultan tests from Udemy also.

- I also reviewed Amer Ali Pgmp Coaching calls in youtube, they were very useful for understanding the mindset of PgMP. There is a booklet in Amazon which is a summary of PgMP Standard and if you study the booklet you do not need to read the PMI book. I strongly recommend it.

- Moreover, I read an Amazon book with 800 questions for passing PgMP at the first try. The book has lots of financial questions, but if you avoid them, the rest of questions have a similar complexity that the real exam. 

-And finally, try to rest well the previous day and have a good breakfast with proteins, fruit, water and avoiding coffee and sugar. You will feel well during the exam.

---------------------------------------------------------------

Are you considering a barndominium? One-story barndominiums offer a unique blend of style, functionality, and comfort. These homes combine rustic charm with modern living, making them a popular choice for those looking for something out of the ordinary. Whether you’re building from scratch or exploring existing models, understanding floor plans and designs is key. Here’s a look at some captivating options.

### Why Choose a One Story Barndominium?

One-story barndominiums provide several advantages. They are more accessible for individuals of all ages, reducing concerns about stairs and upper levels. This type of design allows for a seamless connection between indoor and outdoor spaces, enhancing your lifestyle. Furthermore, they often require less maintenance than multi-story homes, simplifying your daily routine.

### Popular Floor Plan Concepts

When browsing through floor plans for one-story barndominiums, you’ll encounter a variety of layouts that cater to different needs and preferences. Here are some popular concepts:

- **Open Concept Living:** Many one-story barndominiums feature an open floor plan combining the kitchen, dining area, and living space. This layout encourages social interaction and maximizes natural light.
- **Split Bedroom Design:** This design separates the master suite from other bedrooms. Such a layout is ideal for families, providing peace and privacy for parents while keeping kids close by.
- **Indoor/Outdoor Flow:** By incorporating large sliding glass doors or expansive windows, homeowners can blur the lines between indoor and outdoor spaces. This feature allows you to enjoy nature while having a cozy home.

### Customized Features to Consider

Every homeowner has unique needs. Here are some customizable features you might want to consider in your one-story barndominium:

- **Utility Area:** Consider a dedicated utility area for laundry and storage. This not only keeps your home organized but also adds functionality.
- **Covered Porch:** A front or back porch provides the perfect space for morning coffee or evening gatherings.
- **Office Space:** In today’s remote work environment, having a small office nook can become highly beneficial, allowing you to maintain a healthy work-life balance.

### Design Aesthetics

When thinking about designs for your one-story barndominium, both the interior and exterior matter. Many homeowners opt for a rustic feel, using wood and metal finishes, while others may embrace a modern aesthetic with sleek lines and minimalist designs. Here are some design elements to consider:

- **Exterior:** Traditional metal siding pairs beautifully with wooden accents. Opting for neutral colors can create harmony with the surrounding landscape.
- **Interior:** Open beams, vaulted ceilings, and natural light can make your space feel warm and inviting. Incorporate timeless design elements like shiplap and barn doors.

### Popular One Story Barndominium Designs

Some designs have become particularly popular among homeowners. These designs inspire creativity and functionality:

- **The Modern Farmhouse:** A clean and contemporary take on a classic farmhouse, featuring understated elegance and bright, airy spaces.
- **The Craftsman:** This design emphasizes handcrafted details, with built-ins and cozy nooks. It’s perfect for those who love craftsmanship and personal touches.
- **The Simple Minimalist:** For those who prefer a clutter-free living environment, a minimalist barndominium design focuses on functionality and open space.

Exploring one-story barndominiums can be an exciting journey. With their charm and versatility, they are increasingly becoming a favorite for both families and individuals. By defining your needs and preferences in the design and floor plan, you can create a unique space that suits your lifestyle perfectly.

As you investigate barndominium options, remember to focus on your specific requirements to create an inviting and functional home. Each design presents opportunities for personalization, ensuring that your new barndominium is not only livable but reflects your unique style and comfort.

Benefits of Choosing a One Story Barndominium for Your Home Project
-------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to designing your dream home, one story barndominiums stand out as a popular choice. These unique structures blend traditional barn aesthetics with modern architecture, offering numerous benefits. If you’re looking for a home that’s both functional and stylish, here are some compelling reasons to consider a one story barndominium.

### Accessible Living Space

One of the primary advantages of a one story barndominium is accessibility. With everything situated on a single level, homeowners of all ages can navigate their living space without the need for stairs. This makes it an ideal choice for families with young children, elderly relatives, or anyone who prefers to avoid the challenges that come with multiple levels.

### Ease of Maintenance

A one story design is easier to maintain compared to multi-story homes. Cleaning, repairs, and general upkeep can be completed more quickly and efficiently. You can easily access all areas of your home, which saves time and energy. If you enjoy gardening or outdoor living, having everything on one level can also simplify your connection with nature.

### Open Floor Plans

Many one story barndominiums feature open floor plans that promote natural flow and spaciousness. This design enhances the feeling of airiness and allows for versatile use of space. You can customize your living areas according to your needs, whether it’s creating a cozy nook for reading or a large kitchen for entertaining guests. The open layout also fosters engagement among family members, making it easier to interact while cooking or relaxing.

### Energy Efficiency

Another benefit is improved energy efficiency. One story barndominiums often require less energy for heating and cooling compared to larger, multi-level homes. With fewer walls, ceilings, and floors to heat, these homes can help lower your utility bills. Additionally, modern insulation and building materials used in barndominiums can further enhance energy savings.

### Cost-Effectiveness

Building a one story barndominium can be more cost-effective than traditional homes. The simpler design allows for lower construction costs, and you can often find affordable materials that suit your aesthetic preferences. Reduced labor costs are also a factor, as fewer floors generally require less construction time. This combination of savings makes one story barndominiums an attractive option for budget-conscious homeowners.

### Versatility in Design

One of the most exciting aspects of choosing a one story barndominium is the range of design options available. You can customize your floor plan to include various rooms such as home offices, gyms, or additional bedrooms. Many homeowners opt for large windows and high ceilings to create an inviting atmosphere filled with natural light. You can also choose exterior finishes that fit your personal style, from rustic wood to sleek metal.

### Community and Outdoor Living

Living in a one story barndominium also enhances your connection with the community and the outdoors. Many barndominiums are designed to integrate seamlessly with their surroundings. You can create inviting outdoor spaces, such as patios or decks, which encourage family gatherings and neighborhood interactions. These spaces not only extend your living area but also promote a more active lifestyle.

### Simplified Floor Plans

Your choice of layouts for one story barndominiums can be straightforward yet efficient. Consider popular floor plans that include:

- Open kitchen and living room combo
- Dedicated laundry space
- A master suite with an attached bath
- Secondary bedrooms that share a full bathroom

This type of planning maximizes space while ensuring functionality, making daily living easier and more enjoyable.

Ultimately, deciding on a one story barndominium for your home project offers a blend of practicality, style, and affordability. The benefits are numerous, from easy maintenance to versatile design choices, making it a perfect option for a variety of lifestyles. Whether you’re a family looking to settle down or a retiree seeking a cozy sanctuary, a one story barndominium can provide a beautiful, comfortable place to call home.

### Conclusion

Choosing a one-story barndominium offers a wealth of benefits that set it apart from traditional home designs. With their unique floor plans and designs, these structures provide flexibility and customization to suit your lifestyle and preferences. You can effortlessly create open-concept living spaces that promote a sense of togetherness while still maintaining functional zones throughout your home.

One-story barndominiums excel in accessibility, making them an excellent choice for families of all ages. This design eliminates the need for stairs, providing a safer environment for children and seniors alike. Additionally, maintaining a single level can simplify daily tasks and help you age in place without needing to relocate later on.

Moreover, the versatility of barndominium floor plans means that you can incorporate features that resonate with your individual taste. Whether you prefer a modern, rustic, or industrial aesthetic, you can find or design a floor plan tailored to your vision. The open space allows natural light to flood the interiors, creating a warm and inviting atmosphere that enhances your living experience.

The cost-effectiveness of building a one-story barndominium can't be overlooked. With lower building and maintenance costs, you gain a beautiful, functional home without the burden of high expenses. It’s a smart choice that combines style and practicality.

Ultimately, if you're considering a home project, the one-story barndominium could be the perfect solution. Explore the unique designs and floor plans available, and envision how this innovative style can transform your living space into a welcoming retreat that meets all your needs.",1,1758044561.0,BarndosAndCabins,0,1.0,False

I was met with a lot of ""don't worry about it, eat whatever you want!"" or ""don't track things during special occasions,"" but that is straight-up silliness IMO. I am happy to report that I found something that worked!

I needed to plan for 3 days worth of meals for the trip for 2 people: 3 breakfasts, 3 lunches, 3 snacks, and 2 dinners. I pre-prepped the following things that allowed me to stick to my 1800 calorie allotment. It also helps that my wife's maintenance calories are the same as my deficit, so I just doubled everything to make it extra easy.

Breakfast: protein coffee (coffee + 160 calorie optifast premix chocolate shake) + 170g fage yogurt + 100g diced strawberries + 50g blueberries + 50g raspberries + 30g NuTrail protein nut granola = 480 calories

Lunch: Smoked salmon salad (50g celery +30g guacamole + 25g peas + 66g fage greek yogurt + 1oz sauerkraut + 10g goat cheese + .7oz broccoli + 2.4oz smoked salmon + 3 guerrero zero net carb chipotle tortillas = 373 calories

Snacks: various barebells bars or Quest birthday cake cookies (it was my birthday weekend, so I supplied the whole group with these or the birthday cake barebells) or 85g of sugar snap peas = 200-300 calories

Dinner: various Mountain House freeze-dried meals (chili mac is my go-to!) + a prepped salad with kefir and guacamole ranch dressing + 50/50 blend of greens + 50g carrots + 66g mini cucumbers + 30g snap peas +60g broccoli =  700-950 calories

Daily total = 1800-2100 calories

the complicating factor was that I had to spend an entire day prepping the breakfast fruit bowls, salmon salads and dinner salads. Then I had to pack all of this into a cooler with ice so it didn't rot in the hot sun at the campsite. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the Quest birthday cake cookies were, I'd definitely eat those again in the future! This was also the first time that I went camping sober, so I didn't have to make space for 9 million beers lol.

I've been drinking coffee since my mid teens, originally as just a morning drink and later in an attempt to ""pep me up""/""keep me awake"".

I find it doesn't work like expected for me. I'll drink it early in the evening or when studying and it either:

- Doesn't work at all
- Works the opposite way and makes me sleepy
- Has a very delayed reaction. Takes at least 3 hours, if not more, to work. It doesn't so much ""make me energetic"" as it does ""makes my heart race and makes it impossible to sleep for a hour"".

Apparently, this has something to do with the way my brain works. ADHD is more likely to make me sleepy than make me awake.

The only time coffee works as normal is when I take it with a Midol Complete. It took me a while to realize that I need to skip coffee on periods because Midol Complete *messes me up* on coffee. Normally, it makes me fatigued due to the benadryl in it. If I drink it after drinking coffee earlier that day, I'll be uncomfortably laying in bed with my heart racing for a few hours. Caffeine overload?

The bad effects of coffee on me urge me to quit. But, I still do sometimes drink. I either get the urge or I want to see if maybe it'll help me *this time*.

What I like so far:

* The **rose gold case** gives it a really elegant look.
* The **coffee brown leather strap** pairs nicely with the dial, though it’s still pretty stiff out of the box (might need to break it in or soften it up).

ZenGate and the Palm Economy are pushing 4 Catalyst proposals they’re about real-world adoption, millions of transactions on-chain, and building the RWA industry. I wanted to share why I think they’re worth supporting 👇

**Starting with each Proposal and why it benefits Cardano**

**Deploy Faster on Cardano – Open Source Off-Chain Engine**

Right now, every new project wastes time re-building off-chain code to deal with UTXO contention. This proposal ships a battle-tested open-source Golang engine that anyone can use.

Idea is it is an **open-source template** that does the heavy lifting allowing devs to focus on dApp logic and allow *Dapps to be built  2-4 months faster.*

[Deploy Cardano Smart contracts 2-6 months faster- Video Explainer](https://x.com/palmeconomy/status/1965787481728557424)

***Why it matters for Cardano:***

* Lowers the dev barrier → more projects choosing Cardano
* Faster dApp launches = faster ecosystem growth
* More apps = more transactions on-chain

**Vote for: Deploy Faster on Cardano – Open Source Off-Chain Engine**

**Cardano’s First End-to-End Traceable Gold and other minerals!** 

Starts with gold traceability in Latin America (14+ mines), then expands to 30+ minerals. Fully integrated with Cardano DeFi.

***Why it matters for Cardano:***

* Brings real-world assets (RWAs) on-chain at scale and unlocking DeFi
* Institutional adoption needs traceability + compliance Cardano becomes the go-to for institutional grade tracability
* Tens of millions of traceability + DeFi transactions flowing through Cardano
* Grow Cardano's TVL with commodities worth tens to 100s of millions as it scales

Vote for: Cardano’s First End-to-End Traceable Gold

**Onboard 50,000 Nigerian Farmers to Traceability**

Cocoa, coffee, and palm oil farmers in Cross River risk losing EU market access due to EUDR compliance. This proposal brings 50,000 farmers into blockchain traceability on Cardano.

***Why it matters for Cardano:***

* Onboards real users (farmers + co-ops) into the ecosystem
* Each farmer generates ongoing traceability transactions on-chain 
* Protects global supply chains while growing Cardano adoption in Africa

Vote for: Onboard 50,000 Nigerian Farmers to Traceability

**Trace It – Universal Traceability for Everyone**

No easy way exists for businesses or individuals to create traceability events. Trace-It is a universal tool that works across industries.

[Trace it Promo Video](https://x.com/palmeconomy/status/1963685004552081839)

***Why it matters for Cardano:***

* Any business (big or small) can adopt Cardano for traceability
* Unlocks tens of millions of transactions across supply chains, logistics, compliance, and beyond
* Lowers adoption friction = accelerates mass adoption
* create your own records, your own templates, or use premade ones

Vote for: Trace It – Driving Mass Adoption via Universal Traceability

# Why These Proposals Deserve Catalyst Votes

Catalyst isn’t just about funding ideas — it’s about building the future of Cardano.

RWAs coming on-chain (gold, minerals, agriculture)  
Tens of millions of real-world transactions → network growth + fees  
Stronger PALM ecosystem → more rebates + community rewards  
Proof that Cardano solves real problems globally

These proposals are a chance to show what makes Cardano different: traceability, compliance, adoption at scale.

1ninx71,https://www.reddit.com/r/PluggedInPicks/comments/1ninx71/delve_into_the_best_french_press_coffee_maker_by/,Delve Into the Best French Press Coffee Maker by Le Creuset,"Testing out the Le Creuset PG8200CB-1067 French Press has been quite an experience, especially for someone like me who enjoys a good morning cup of coffee. This elegant-looking stoneware French Press in the vibrant Cerise color feels less like a coffee maker and more like a piece of art that sits gracefully on my kitchen counter. At first glance, what caught my attention was the premium stoneware build and the smooth glaze finish, which suggests durability while being incredibly aesthetic. It's been marketed as dishwasher-safe and resistant to scratches and stains—a feature that immediately sold me on the idea of introducing it to my daily coffee-making ritual. I love my French press coffee routine, but let's explore how this product actually holds up under daily use.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing you notice is how substantial it feels. Weighing 3 pounds and measuring 6.5 x 5.25 x 9.6 inches, it commands attention without being overwhelming. The Cerise color, especially with the glossy finish, is stunning and adds personality to my otherwise monochrome kitchen. My favorite part is the stoneware build, which delivers excellent heat retention, meaning my coffee stays piping hot longer than it would in a glass French Press. Its robust build makes it feel like it could last years, even with daily usage. The glaze is not just for show—being resistant to chips and scratches is an absolute lifesaver for someone as clumsy as I can be sometimes.

**Ease of Use and Functionality**  
The manual operation is as traditional as it gets, but that's part of the charm. Using this French Press has brought a certain satisfaction to my mornings as I brew coarsely ground coffee. The mesh sieve consistently filters out the grounds, leaving me with a smooth, rich-tasting cup every time. The smooth, glazed interior helps with easy cleaning after use, and I’ve noticed it doesn’t absorb any odors or stains from the coffee, which is a win in my book. While the non-reactive material is perfect for coffee, I’ve even found myself using it for brewing tea leaves on occasion.

[Check Le Creuset PG8200CB-1067 price on Amazon.](https://newcookware.com/p/b006y40ieo/)

**Positives**  
This French Press stands out in several ways, which is why it has easily integrated itself into my coffee rituals.  
- The premium stoneware material ensures long-lasting durability and superior heat retention.  
- The vibrant glaze finish is resistant to chips, scratches, and stains, keeping it looking brand-new.  
- Its dishwasher-safe feature makes cleanup straightforward and convenient.  
- The versatility of using it for coffee or tea brewing adds to its appeal.

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
As much as I adore this coffee maker, it’s not without its faults.  
- The heavy stoneware build, while durable, might feel cumbersome for some users.  
- Its 34-ounce capacity is ideal for two or three cups but might not cater to larger groups.  
- I’ve noticed it can get slippery if handled with wet hands due to the glossy finish. A more ergonomic handle design might have helped.  

**Competing Products**  
Having used other French Presses like the Bodum Chambord and the Frieling Double Wall Stainless Steel Press, I found some interesting distinctions. The Bodum, while lighter and more affordable, doesn't quite match the Le Creuset’s impressive heat retention or aesthetic appeal. On the other hand, the Frieling's stainless steel build is unbreakable, but it lacks the ceramic elegance and charm that this product offers. Compared to these, the Le Creuset feels distinctly premium, even though its weight and price point might not suit everyone. 

**Price Performance**  
Talking about whether this French Press is worth the investment is a bit tricky. It leans towards the higher end of the price spectrum, but for good reasons. The materials used—the dense stoneware—are not only durable but also efficient in terms of heat retention. If you're someone who values both form and function in their kitchen appliances, this surely feels like a worthwhile investment. For the design and build quality alone, I’d argue that it offers much better value than many similarly priced options on the market. But if price is a concern, you might find something more budget-friendly with functional compromises.

We’ve had a lot of issues through the years that I think we both hold a lot of resentment for. He helped me while I was in college and pretty much helped me grow up. He does a lot for me, but also really stresses me out and gets mad over the smallest things and will literally not talk to me for days, while I get over things pretty quickly. I do love him, I just feel more like roommates than anything. 
With him helping me through college (I paid him back every cent) I now make about 5x more than him. He’s always been a bit financially controlling, getting on my back for getting a coffee or really anything since we’ve been “saving money” since the second we got together. It’s been a balance because if it were up to me, I’d be spending a lot more so while I appreciate the balance of it, it’s been a little suffocating, considering his income doesn’t even cover the bills. (I’ve never minded his lesser income through our relationship.)
My problem now is for years I have been craving being on my own, having my own apartment, being my own person without him. (Again, we’ve always had issues.) Recently he’s accused me of cheating which I haven’t done, but how do you prove something you haven’t done? That’s opened my eyes to how he sees me- as someone who would do that when I’ve always been extremely against cheating and would never do so. He’s convinced himself he found part of a condom, a brand we’ve never used. I’m pretty certain we have used it, but I’m 100% certain I didn’t use it with someone else. Anyway, I really feel the need to leave and get my own place and be my own person without him but that would leave him barely able to pay the bills.
He was able to before me, and had a large savings, so I’m sure he could work it out after me…. But the guilt is stopping me from leaving. I do love him but for the past few years I’ve been checked out, just going through the motions. That’s why it’s so hard to think he may struggle if I leave. 
He would be too proud to take spousal support or any help from me. 
Another thing is he works 32 hours/week, at an entry level position. I’ve asked about what his goals are and if he’d want to go back to school for a more lucrative opportunity, but he’s not interested or motivated, he’s content where he’s at. 

If I left I’d leave him the savings, the house, and his car.

TLDR; WIBTA if I divorced my husband, leaving him unable to pay bills unless he found a way to make more money.",1,1758043701.0,WouldIBeTheAhole,3,0.67,False

1nintzj,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1nintzj/the_journal_of_an_exorcist_diocese_of_richford/,"The Journal of an Exorcist, Diocese of Richford, 1975","***October 3, 1975, Preamble*** 

“Lord, forgive me for refusing Your mercy. I turned away when I should have accepted. I cannot seem to pardon myself, and by that failure I have turned from You. If judgment comes, may I meet it with honesty. Thank You for the bread, the roof, and the years already given. Amen.”

To whoever may one day read these lines: forgive me as well. The decision I set down will not be read without weight. It may damn me, or it may free another. I write less for my own soul and more for yours.

I am Father Michael Roberts of the Diocese of Richford. Ordained a priest in 1963, appointed as diocesan exorcist in 1971. Bishop Niles gave me the title reluctantly, more a bureaucratic concession than an act of faith. He never cared for the idea of devils in the flesh. Said the real demons were social and cultural. Vietnam, drugs, the collapse of the family pew. 

He told me once, cigarette smoke curling from his lips, “Mike, nobody believes in possession anymore. But Rome wants the box ticked, so here you are.”

I was not chosen because of talent. I was chosen because I still believed. Believed in what most of my brothers dismissed as medieval superstition. They saw sin as metaphor, devils as poetry. I saw them as facts. I still do.

Every year fewer men coming out of seminary treat possession as anything more than theater for the gullible. They see the Gospels as allegory, the rites as drama meant to soothe the unstable. That disbelief leeches power from the Church like termites hollowing a beam.

An exorcist works with more than his own conviction. The strength comes from the whole body of the Church, past and present. Without that faith, the rite rings hollow. My mentor, Father Cecil Rollo, told me that when he began his work in the fifties, one or two nights at the bedside were usually enough. Now, he said, cases dragged on for months, sometimes longer, because the enemy no longer met resistance but found a soft place to nest.

I think of his words each time I open the Ritual. And I think of them now, as I set down what became my last case.

***September 5th, 1974***

The call came through the rectory office. Not from a priest, not from the chancery, but from a secretary. Odd. Secretaries don’t usually contact exorcists. Requests normally move through rectors and bishops.

The woman on the other end gave her name: Laura Summers, parish secretary at Good Shepherd Church. She spoke in halting phrases, like someone not used to asking for favors. 

“Father Roberts, please don’t involve the Diocese yet. Father Amora has been unwell. I believe it may be more than illness…Please, if you could come to Beverly, meet me here at the church, I would be grateful. If you could, treat this as a personal favor. We don’t want the Bishop involved until we’re sure.”

I asked what exactly was happening.

She hesitated, then said, “He isn’t himself. That’s the only way I can put it. Could you come meet me? Just to see?”

The request carried no signature from Rome, no blessing from the Bishop. Just a frightened woman trying to keep her priest from public shame. Against my better judgment, I agreed.

I knew Amora only by reputation. Small parish in Beverly, quiet man, bookish, led retreats for families. He was not a name that made waves.

I told her I would come. Work in Richford kept me occupied until the next week, but I phoned her nightly from the rectory line, long cord stretched across the linoleum kitchen floor. Each time she answered, her words were clipped, anxious. She repeated that his state was “getting worse.”

 ***September 12th, 1974***

I reached Beverly by late afternoon under a slate sky that hung low and bruised. The spire of Good Shepherd cut through it like a splinter. 

The car sputtered when I shut it off. The Chevy had seen better years. I leaned across the torn seat, pulled my umbrella from the back, and stepped out as the rain broke open. Water hammered the asphalt in sheets, splashing up around my shoes, rolling off the umbrella like coins down a chute.

Before I left the car I checked for the rosary. It hung in my coat pocket, worn wood smoothed by years of use. I touched the beads to steady myself. A weapon, yes, though more for courage than power.

The path to Good Shepherd was narrow stone, the kind that catches puddles in its cracks. My shoes slipped once on the moss. The Romanesque tower loomed against the sky, weathered blocks darkened by the storm.

Through the storm I caught a woman’s call. Thin, high, carried more by need than volume.

“Father Roberts?”

I raised my voice against the downpour. “I am. You must be Laura.”

A figure in a wool skirt stood at the oak door, rain plastering her hair to her temple. She lifted her arm in signal and pulled at the heavy door until it swung.

“Come in, Father. Let’s get you out of this mess.”

I stepped into the vestibule, shook off the water, and drew a smile for her. The silence of the interior struck me harder than the storm. The rain seemed to die at the threshold, replaced only by the low rumble of distant thunder and the sound of her unsteady breathing.

The interior itself was dim, older than its parishioners probably realized. The stonework carried the weight of another century, arches pressing upward as if to force the roof higher than heaven would allow. Columns of brick gave way to colored panes that tossed fractured light across the floor.

Laura kept her arms wrapped across herself as though bracing against a draft. “Father, I hated to call you. Truly. But we don’t know what else to do. He’s not the same. We’ve all seen it.”

I studied her hesitation. A parish secretary afraid to speak of her priest is no small thing.

““Don’t apologize,” I said.” You did right. I came on my own time.”

Her reply came fast, sharper than I expected. “You didn’t tell anyone, did you? Not even the bishop?”

“No. Not Bishop Niles, not anyone. If I find cause for alarm, I’ll have to report it. Until then, this stays between us.”

She lowered her gaze to the stone floor, tracing its wear with her eyes as if searching for words in the grooves. “I hope it doesn’t come to that. Father Amora’s a good man. I don’t want to see him sent away.”

“Let’s focus on what’s here,” I told her. “Tell me what you’ve seen.”

She exhaled through her nose, long and strained. “It started small. He said he was tired. Always tired. We brought meals but he couldn’t keep food down. I thought flu at first. But then… then his temper.”

“Explain.”

“At Mass. He snapped at the altar boys. Rushed the consecration. And when he gave communion, sometimes he dropped the host. Didn’t even bend to pick it up.” She pressed her lips into a line, eyes wet but held back. “That was one of the last times I saw him smile.”

I drew a handkerchief across my suit sleeve, brushing away water still clinging from the storm. “And beyond that?”

She hesitated, then leaned closer. “His face changes. Not all at once. Just while he speaks. There are times it feels like I’m talking to someone else entirely.”

I marked her words carefully. Food rejected, temper warped, sacraments defiled, countenance altered. Classic signs.

“Where is he now?” I asked.

Laura raised one arm and indicated the long corridor that opened beside the nave. The passage stretched into darkness, lit only by two weak bulbs that buzzed overhead.

“In his chamber,” she said. “I didn’t warn him you were coming. I thought he’d protest if he knew.”

The hallway breathed cold air, though every window was shut. The draft pressed against my face with the bite of the storm outside, yet it carried no rain. My skin prickled as though something deeper than weather stirred down that passage.

“Take me there,” I said.

She turned without comment and moved ahead, her shoes clicking faintly against the stone. I followed, noting the way her pace faltered near the middle of the hall, as though her body resisted carrying her farther.

As we walked, I asked, “How long has he kept to himself?”

“Three weeks. Maybe more. He hasn’t heard confessions. He doesn’t visit the sick. I can’t remember his last blessing.""

“And Mass?”

She stopped in stride. “He performs it when he must. The congregation feels it. They whisper afterward. It’s as though the words come through him without meaning.”

We reached a heavy wooden door at the far end. She kept her distance from it, arms crossed. “He stays inside. Day and night. I don’t know if he even sleeps. I hear movement at all hours.”

I tried to ease her. “And yet,” I said, “he’s refrained from forcing the sacraments in his state. That restraint may be a mercy left to him.”

For the first time since I had arrived, she raised her eyes to me. They were damp, rimmed with sleeplessness. “You’ll see for yourself, Father. I don’t want to go in.”

“Then leave me with him,” I said.

Laura’s chest rose in a stifled breath. She shifted on her feet as if weighing whether to abandon me to what waited. Finally she whispered, ““Be careful, Father. Please.” and walked back down the hall, her shape shrinking until the shadows swallowed her.

I stood alone before the chamber door. The corridor behind me gave no comfort. The building carried the same pressure as a storm front. I laid my palm against the wood. It was colder than stone.

“In the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.” I felt each tap of my fingertips land against my forehead, stomach and shoulders. At this point the sign of the cross was just a routine performance for me. Just a task to be checked off. Habit can turn armor into costume. 

Remember this dear reader, repetition without belief creates spiritual weakness. You *must* believe. Have faith.

I bit the inside of my cheek out of nervous habit and opened up the door to Father Amora’s bedchambers.

The smell of stale grains hit me immediately. The chamber sat in near-black, candles stationed in a few saucers across the floor and on a dresser.They burned low, syrupy light trembling against plaster and stone. A radiator clanked once and went dead.

“Father Roberts, welcome.” The words crawled from the dark. Boards creaked in the far corner.

He stepped into the candlewash.

His skin was pale and sickly with the texture of wet paper. Around his neck lay a dark mark. It appeared to be rope burn from quite a serious injury. Father Amora’s eyes showed wetness tracked from the sockets. The light found them and turned them to glass.

I stepped further inside the Priest's chambers and closed the large door behind me. It clasped shut with an echo that filled the otherwise silent room.

“Matthew,” I said. “Your parish is concerned. I came to see you.”

He raised one arm and dragged his knuckles across the ligature mark, coins chiming somewhere under his sleeve with each pass.

After just a moment our eyes had met and he began to speak to me once again. His voice had the consistency of dust and gravel and had poured out of his mouth like bags of rocks.

“Matthew is not here to talk,” he said. “You may sit. We can have a proper exchange.”

To my left, a chair that hadn’t been by the wall a second ago. Maybe I missed it in the dark. Maybe not.

I shook myself into confidence. I was sure of it at this point. I wasn’t speaking to someone suffering from an onset of mental illness. I was speaking with something otherworldly.

“I’ll take no offer nor gift from a demon. I will stand.”

The thing that was cloaked in the dark attire of the Church grew silent. His hands were still grinding along his neck.

“I am no demon.” The man finally muttered. His words came out broken by the deepest depths of unimaginable sorrow.

“Then in Jesus’s name I command you, who are you?” I took a step closer to the creature that was made man. And that creature merely watched with profound grief.

“I am no demon and I need no commands. I was a follower of Christ. I am the man whose existence would have been better to have never been born. I am the knower and the kisser of Jesus. Know me Priest, for I am the only one you will meet tonight who accepts his judgment.”

I found myself once again enveloped by the inescapable silence of the room. The flames of the candles wafted softly with the slow current of the air. The wind brought with it the subtle smell of decay and death.

“By the authority of Christ, say why you came,” I said.

The welt at his throat darkened, then beaded. Thin rivulets traced the collarbone and disappeared into cloth. He sagged to his knees. Wool rasped across the boards. Coins struck the floor in a scatter that made my stomach turn.

“I speak to you now Priest, here me. I am a man who had never asked for forgiveness, though forgiveness was mine to take. I could not forgive myself for my own actions. And through Christ I am here with you now, warning you of the same. For by the end of the night, you will be with me in my judgment.”

I knew at that moment that I should’ve turned around and fled. I knew that I should've contacted Bishop Niles for assistance. I knew the Diocese would need to hear about this. Yet I stayed there, with this man of infinite sorrows.

“Do you stand in awe of God, priest?” he asked.

“Yes,” I said. The word came out thin.

“His charity is too large for us. If He sees me as I am, I will turn away. The others will not. They will meet His light with envy.”

“What others?”

He lifted his face. Tears and blood met and ran together. Sockets glimmered as if lit from within.

“The Adversary wears a mirror of the image He embodies,” he said. “There are three within the enemy, a counterfeit of the Three above.”

“Name them,” I said.

“You will hear from them yourself,” he answered. “As with Job, you have been offered. Only for a night.”

He folded at the waist and went still, as if the strings had been cut. He fell to his face on the floor. I rushed over to him and grabbed the Father by his shirt, flipping his body upright. The mark on his neck was gone. Only the remnants of dried blood remained.

“Matthew. Wake.” I tapped his cheek with two knuckles. A tremor moved under the skin around his lids; then he focused on me, or tried to.

“Father Roberts?” His grasp found my sleeve and held. “What is this?”

“What did you invite in?” I asked. My voice was down to a thread. “Can you stand?”

I pulled him upright. He swayed. We staggered together to the narrow bed and eased him down. Springs groaned. He slid his feet onto the mattress and let his head sink into a flat pillow.

I dragged the chair from the wall. The legs protested across the boards. I sat close.

He lay there thin as a famine year, shirt clinging, heat coming off his skin. I studied the ruin of him and felt something inside me tilt.

“What have you done?” I asked again.

His mouth worked once. “Father,” he said, “I know the Third Secret. Fatima.”

The room seemed to list. For a man of my stripe in 1974, those words hit like a mallet. Rome had not published it. Everyone had a theory. Charismatics said one thing, scholars another, the cranks on shortwave radio something worse. To hear it invoked here, in this bed, turned the whole chamber.

Then the change came. The light from the candles flared as if fed from under the floorboards. Matthew’s head rolled toward me, and two discs of cold blue lit under the lids like lamps uncovered.

A new presence sat up in his body as though it had always owned the lease.

“God has set you apart for a night,” it said. “We can talk plainly. He will not interrupt.”

It folded its hands in its lap and smiled with clean, white teeth. The smile held nothing human.

I spoke my prayers beside the man's bedside yet received no indication that this being was uncomfortable around them. He merely smiled at me with his idyllic white teeth.

“Your prayers will not work here, not tonight. We have control. Through God we can do whatever we would like to you. He believes in you Michael. Truly he does. And I believe you know that he shouldn’t have trust in you.”

I felt my heart lunge. Had I not asked for forgiveness prior to coming? Had I somehow fallen out of God’s grace? Why were my prayers falling on deaf ears?

I reached for the beads at my belt and looped them over my sleeve, brought the cross to my chest, and began: “O God, who by the light of the Holy Spirit-”

It laughed, soft as a match strike. “Fire upon fire,” it said. “He sets tongues aflame. I am the Bringer of Light. You call me Lord of Darkness. Explain that arithmetic.”

“Leave him,” I said. “In the name of Christ.”

It tilted its head toward the bedside table. A bottle sat there, church wine with a parish sticker. “Drink,” it said. “As any other night. We see what you do when there is no one to applaud. We judge less than He does.”

The man laughed. The calmness of his voice sent a shiver down my spine.

Why did I feel nothing with my prayers? Why was this demon allowed to speak of the Holy Spirit and of Christ? His very name should be enough to cast the demon out of the body of the possessed.

“Speak to me, Michael. Your prayers to God are heard yet remain unanswered. You have been willingly separated from God for tonight. Embrace it. You’ll never have an opportunity like this again.”

I bit my tongue. ‘Silence is a virtue, don’t speak to it. Don’t let it deceive you.’

I kept the cross against my sternum. “Mother of the Word Incarnate, shelter me under your veil,” I said within.

Its pleasant expression went sour. “Do not ignore me,” it said. “See me. Measure me. You think yourself above us. Who are you, clay, to be bowed to by light?”

The flames climbed higher, licking the air. My shirt stuck to my back. I wiped my brow with the cuff.

“Look upon me, you most worthless of creations. Gaze upon the one you proudly think yourself better than. I ask you, who are you to gaze upon Angels and think ‘I am more than them.’ Who are you, that we divine beings must bend our knees to?”

I wiped the wet from my eyes, my vision growing blurry from the heat.

Through the unfocused haze of my vision I saw the face of an aberrant man looking back at me. His jaw was clenched tight and his teeth were fully exposed. Anger and fury poured out of every inch of his person.

“Here me you banished child of Eve, destroyer of perfection, your Church will fall. The Great Apostasy is here. I exist within every new doctrine of God’s beloved Bride. And I will ravage every last one of you. I will show God how unworthy all of you were to receive his love.” The beast spit at me.

I felt the anger rising from within my soul. I could no longer keep silent.

“By Jesus Christ I command you to tell me, does Satan love you?”

The beast sitting inches away from me screamed out in hysterical fury.

“Yes, for I am he and he is me. I suffer as Christ did for every good deed you allow God to flow through you. I suffer in pain because of you. Christ may be Lord of Man, but I shall be the Lord of Flies.”

With that a terrible wind blew through the bedchambers. The candlelight extinguished itself under the vigorous rush of air. The heat in the room was quickly replaced by a deathly chill. The last ember of the of fire faded into ash as the darkness fully enveloped me.

“Where are you?” I commanded as I sat up from my chair. The blackness of the abyss surrounded me. Only the sparse sounds of scattering feet filled the emptiness of the chamber. Eventually a sound emerged from the darkness.

A slithering, echoed voice of something truly beyond the world of men appeared behind me. It whispered to me behind my back. I could feel its breath like ice wrap around my neck.

“To gaze upon the face of God would kill a man outright. Imagine what would happen if you gazed upon me. Consider the death of light to be your only blessing. Now, reach out before you and touch the bed.”

I felt my arm twitch as my hand seemingly moved on its own accord. Was I being commanded? Or was I willing to do whatever this thing asked of me?

I had placed my hand upon the bed and was met by the outline of the unconscious body of Father Amora. Yet the voice continued to speak with me from right behind my ear.

“The Great Apostasy is here. The Church is falling. As are all Churches. The Bride of Christ will be mine. At the end times and I shall violate her in front of the Lord. As I would violate you right here and now if the leash from Heaven were not so tight.”

“Say that plain,” I said. I kept the crucifix pressed to my chest.

“It is plain,” it said. “The Third Secret of Fatima names what you fear in word. The House will trade its rites for a new catechism of comfort. Men who once defended what must not bend will trade truth for taste. They will come with applause and hand me their altars. God will hold out mercy and the multitudes will refuse it.”

“Who benefits from that?” I asked.

“It benefits the one who fashions a counterfeit,” it said. “A choice is set before you, priest. Keep the secret to save a parish for a season and doom the many later. Or tear the curtain now and stir up ruin that may wake some. Speak and the world convulses. Hold and the rot spreads slow but sure.”

I felt the chill of that offer deep in me. The place where a simple man should answer trembled.

“The hour is here, Michael,” it went on. “Fight delay. Let the Church die on your watch, or hasten the end and let truth stand in the wreckage. The choice sits on your table.”

And with that the cold breath of utter damnation left the room. I guided my hands around in darkness until I came upon a lighter and a candle. I lit the wick with shaking handsThe flint struck. Flame caught the wick. The candle threw a small, honest circle of light.

The priest on the mattress slept as a man who had weathered a storm. Color returned to his face. He was the man I had known before any of this began.

I did not mistake what happened. A power greater than my fear had intervened. If anything in that room had been unclean, it had been pushed out at a single, terrible instant. The event felt like a door closing behind something that will not be invited back.

***October 3, 1975, Reflection***

I drove away from Good Shepherd with a hollow in my chest I will not trade for explanation. Anxiety sat with me in the passenger seat. It did not leave when I reached home. My faith had been shaken. I found, after several fits of prayer and sleepless hours, that I could not recite certain prayers without a foreign weight pressing on them.

Resignation followed as a slow, logical act. I stepped down from diocesan duties because I no longer trusted the pew to shelter what needed shelter. I could not live with the lie that everything was tidy inside the house.

What I decided, after days that smelled of coffee and cigarette smoke and late broadcasts about broken politics, was to speak. Not in the language of conspiracy or fevered pamphlet. Not to spread panic. To tell truths I had seen and to name what wanted to replace holy practice with pastime.

I will say this plainly and painfully: the rot is not only in one building or one rite. It runs through many flocks. Men who ought to hold to the tradition have chosen ease. That choice hands people to something else.

When the Lord comes, He will carry the marks of mercy fulfilled, not open wounds that beg the world for pity. If what I saw is any measure, the Great Apostasy has begun in some corners. The work now is to save what remains honest, to keep the poor and the small from being swept away by those who sell a comfortable substitute.

I will keep this record. If the hour demands it, I will speak in public. For now I will gather witnesses, letters, and proof. The road ahead will not be neat. It will be work. It will be prayer. It will be the unpopular duty of naming what men prefer not to name.

Pray for mercy. Pray for clarity.

Prior to moving in with me, he had lived at home with his parents and had very limited experience with cleaning and household responsibilities. When he moved in with me, I immediately noticed he was VERY messy and at first I chalked this up to simply being a learning curve with moving out for the first time. I tried to give him some grace and picked up the slack, but I would bring it up in a joking way hoping he would get the hint that he needed to step it up. Did not work. Fast forward to now, and this has become a big point of contention in our relationship, particularly because, in addition to not being an equal partner with the household tasks, he also works less hours than I do (about 10 hours less a week on average) which to me is another indicator that he should ABSOLUTELY be helping more. I have expressed this to him consistently for the past year or so, which has yielded many temporary improvements and even some sustained improvement, but has mainly turned into ongoing arguments and honestly pushed me into that uncomfortable territory of constantly feeling like I'm nagging and acting like a parent. This is not at ALL the dynamic I want in a partner/marriage, and has led to me losing a lot of respect for him and questioning his ability to adequately support me in a marriage. Not to mention my sex drive is at an all time low. :/ When we talk about this, he says he feels like he ""can do nothing right"" in my eyes and that he does a lot more than I think he does...I will say he does do dishes consistently and tidies up here and there, however I am consistently cleaning our living space alone and then ALSO picking up his dirty clothing, coffee cups, snack wrappers, half eaten food etc. that he leaves all over our home. 

This work ethic outside of the home is another issue: he recently has expressed financial concerns (valid) as his boat broke down and he had to pay for some repairs to his truck as well in the past month. I am very sympathetic of this and have been stepping up and paying for a lot of the extras lately. We split all bills, but lately when it is his turn to pay for groceries he becomes very irritable and at times makes me feel as though I can't buy anything new or extra (he was huffing in the store yesterday over me putting a box of frittatas from the frozen section in the cart). I am very budget conscious and what I would consider low maintenance...so if I want a frozen frittata I'm getting the damn frittata lol. I'm just really grossed out that instead of picking up more hours at work or picking up some side jobs to help offset the costs of his hobbies he would instead try to put the responsibility on me to be more frugal and make me feel bad for adding ONE ITEM to the grocery list. 

Anyway, our wedding is coming up in May and these things have just been nagging at me. I have made a conscious effort to try and deal with these issues directly and not allow them to change my level of respect for him. However frankly I have begun to view him as lazy and unmotivated, and I feel awful about it. I love my fiance, I truly do, and he has many wonderful qualities. He is kind, extremely loyal and faithful, and we are genuinely best friends. However, thinking about having kids with him down the line and being legally and financially tied to him is making me panic a little. Growing up, all the men in my family were strong providers, and I have always wanted a partner that would do the same because I want to be a mother and go down to part time work or stay at home when my children are young. He says he will make it happen when the time comes but based on the above I'm not holding my breath on that. I have no idea how I will manage working fulltime, caring for our home, cleaning, and taking care of our child(ren)...I know we need to have a SERIOUS come to Jesus conversation asap but am I overreacting here by seriously considering calling off the wedding??

1ninoip,https://i.redd.it/5bt4ndg59kpf1.jpeg,Soggy pucks and high pressure [Gamilia Owl and Fellow Opus],"So I'm new to espresso and I could use some help.

Background:  I've been a big pour over guy for a few years and I've got that process dialed in pretty well.  When I was on a work trip, there was an old espresso machine that we got up and running.  There was an old grinder that was time based not weight based.  We stumbled upon the right timings and got some pretty decent double shots pulled.

I've since purchased the Gamilia Owl and have begun my esspresso era.
That being said, I'm haveing a tough time dialing in.

I have a Fellow Opus grinder that I've used with my V60 for over a year.  I grind on 7/2 for pour over using various Black Rifle Dark Roasts (I know I'm in the minority here but I really prefer dark smoky roasts with much higher bitterness and very little acidity. I know you lose origin flavor profiles etc but hey, I like what I like.)
I tried grinding for espresso at a 3 and it pegged the bars up at 18-20.  I started working up in grind size and my results are below.

Coffee (Dark Roast ""Blackbeard's Delight"" Black Rifle subscription) 14.3g
11 bars
Pre infusion 5s
Temperature 201°
Water 40g/30sec
Opus grind setting 5/3 -.3
Normcor variable tamper, setting #1 (15lbs)


I'm still getting 11-12bars of pressure and soggy pucks, if I grind any finer it pegs the pressure to the right.  I can get down to 9 bars by only brewing like 11-12gs but that seems way low for a double shot.  I'm hesitant to go any higher on the grinder, I already feel like being up in the 5s is too high.

LAUREN'S POV

 

I knew today would fall apart but hearing it from my daughter made it worse.
“Mommy, do you think Daddy forgot again?”
That question hit me harder than I thought it would. I looked up from the sink where I’d been rinsing off Elena’s cereal bowl. Her voice was soft, like she already knew the answer but wanted to hear something else. Anything else.
I dried my hands on the dish towel and walked into the living room. There she was, sitting on the edge of the couch in her pink dress, the same one she’d picked out two weeks ago just for today. Her legs dangled above the floor, her shiny black shoes tapping gently against the couch.
“No, baby,” I said, trying to keep my voice steady. “Daddy’s just… running a little late, that’s all. He said he’d be here before five, remember?”
She looked up at the wall clock. It was already a quarter past six.
“He said that last year too,” she mumbled, eyes drifting toward the window. “And he never came.”
I swallowed the lump forming in my throat. She remembered. I didn’t have the heart to lie to her, but I also didn’t want to crush whatever little hope she was holding on to.
“Elena,” I crouched down beside her, tucking a loose strand of hair behind her ear. “I know he missed last year, but he promised he’d make it up this time. Maybe something came up at work. Grown-up stuff can be really… complicated sometimes.”
She didn’t answer. Just kept staring out the window like she was waiting for a miracle to pull into the driveway.
I stood up and rubbed my palms down my jeans, trying to stay calm. Inside, I was burning. Not just from today but from everything. Every missed birthday. Every forgotten school event. Every night Elena asked me where he was and I had to pretend like I knew.
I reached for my phone and dialed Ethan's number but he wasn't picking up.
The clock struck 6:30 pm and I already knew Ethan would come home late. Elena's face was already pale and she looked tired from sitting in the exact position for so long. There was no need for her to keep on waiting for her father who couldn't keep his promise.
“Rosa,” I called out.
The maid poked her head from the hallway.
""Yes ma'am.""
""Can you help Elena change into her nightwear, please?”
Elena’s face dropped, but she didn’t fight it. She just slid off the couch and followed Rosa upstairs quietly, dragging her feet as she went.
I sat down, staring at the empty doorway. The silence in the house felt heavier than usual. I picked up my phone and checked the time again. 6:47 PM. Still no text. No call. Nothing.
I sent him a quick message: “Ethan, where are you? Elena waited all day. You promised.”
Still no response.
The hours passed slowly. I sat on the couch, scrolling through the same old photos on my phone, the ones where we actually looked like a family. Back when Ethan used to smile for real. Back when he used to come home early. Back when he looked at me like I was more than just… background noise.
At 8:20 PM, Rosa came back downstairs.
“She’s asleep, ma’am. Didn’t touch her glass of milk.”
I nodded. “Thanks, Rosa. You can go to rest.”
I climbed the stairs slowly, peeking into Elena’s room. She was curled up in bed, still in her dress. I was sure she refused to take them off. Her arms wrapped around that old teddy bear Ethan gave her when she was a baby one of the few things he actually showed up for.
I walked over and gently pulled the blanket over her. She didn’t even stir.
“Happy birthday, baby,” I whispered, kissing her forehead. “I’m so sorry.”
Back downstairs, I waited. The clock ticked past 9, then 10, then 11. I didn’t even realize how late it was until the numbers turned to 12:00.
I almost didn’t hear the front door click open.
I shot up, my heart racing. It was him.
Ethan stepped inside like nothing had happened. Coat in one hand, phone in the other. He didn’t even look surprised to see me still awake.
“Where have you been?” I said, my voice high but shaking. I can't remember the last time I raised my voice at him but right now I don't care how high my voice was.
He blinked. “I told you, I have had a lot going on at the company lately.""
“Don’t.” I held up my hand. “Don’t you dare say that again.”
He sighed, like I was the one being unreasonable. “Lauren, I had a long day, alright? I’m tired, and I really don’t want to do this right now.”
“No. You don’t get to walk in here and act like nothing happened. Your daughter sat in that living room all dressed up, waiting for you. She kept staring at the clock like you were going to burst through that door with balloons and hugs. And you never came.”
Something flickered across his face, maybe guilt, maybe just discomfort. But I saw it. I knew that look. He forgot. Again. Just like last year.
“She told you every morning for the last two weeks that today was her birthday. She counted down on the fridge calendar. She talked about it nonstop.”
“I was busy, Lauren.”
“Busy with what? That you couldn't pick up my call or reply to my messages? You run your own business, Ethan. You set your schedule. You could’ve made time if you wanted to. One day. One dam day for your daughter.”
He looked away, jaw tight. “I’m not doing this.”
He turned to walk past me, but I reached out and grabbed his arm and he quickly turned. There was a faint scent of something sweet and unfamiliar — not his and definitely not mine. That’s when I saw it.
A faint pink lip stain on the collar of his white shirt.

Lipstick.

I stared at it. The world around me dimmed for a second, the silence roaring in my eyes.
“Who is she?” I asked, barely above a whisper.

LAUREN'S POV

“Who is she, Ethan?” I asked again, louder this time, my voice shaking.
Ethan’s eyes darted to the side like he was thinking of what to say. “What are you talking about?” he said finally, blinking like I’d just accused him of something crazy.
I pointed at his collar. “The lipstick. It’s not mine, Ethan. So again, who is she?”
He looked down slowly, like he was just noticing it for the first time. There it was. That soft pink smudge stood out against his white shirt like a slap to my face.
“Oh,” he said, brushing at it. “That? It’s nothing. One of the girls at the office… she tripped or something and bumped into me. Maybe it got there then.”
I stared at him. “She tripped? Onto your collar?”
He shrugged like it wasn’t a big deal. “It was just a stubid accident, Lauren. Don’t start making something out of nothing.”
“Don’t talk to me like I’m stubid,” I snapped.
He sighed like he was already tired of the conversation. “Here we go again. You always do this. You always jump to the worst conclusion. You blow everything out of proportion.”
I blinked, stunned. “So now it’s my fault?”
He stepped past me and dropped his coat on the couch. “I don’t have the energy for this right now.”
I followed him. “No, you don’t get to walk away and pretend this isn’t happening. Our daughter waited the whole day for you. I waited. And you show up late, smelling like a woman's perfume and with lipstick on your shirt, and I’m supposed to just swallow it?”
He turned sharply. “Jesus, Lauren, it was nothing. You’re so dramatic. You always have to make everything a scene.”
“Because you keep giving me scenes!” My voice cracked. “You forgot her birthday again, Ethan. How many times does that make it? Two? Three?”
He rubbed his hands down his face and looked up at the ceiling. “I said I was busy.”
“No, you said you’d be here,” I said quietly. “And you weren’t. Again.”
He didn’t answer that.
I felt something inside me fall a little lower. It was always like this — me begging for scraps of honesty while he acted like I was imagining things.
I looked at him. I mean, really looked at him. Same face I used to love since college. Same brown eyes that once looked at me like I was his whole world. But now… it was like there was a wall between us. One I couldn’t break through no matter how hard I tried.
He started walking toward the stairs.
“Where are you going?” I asked.
“I’m taking a shower,” he said, not even looking back. 
""Won't you have dinner?""
""I’m not hungry,” he replied coldly.
I watched him disappear up the stairs, my whole body feeling heavy. I stood in the middle of the living room with my arms crossed, trying not to cry. Maybe he was telling the truth. Maybe I was just overthinking it. It could’ve been just an accident, like he said. Ethan wouldn’t cheat on me… right? We’ve been through too much together. He wouldn’t hurt me like that.
Then my phone pinged.
I reached for it slowly, not expecting much. Probably an email or some discount code.
But it wasn’t.
It was a message from Tessa my best friend.
Tess💗: “Lauren… I wasn’t sure if I should send this, but I think you need to see it.”
She added a link.
My stomach turned. Tessa wouldn’t send me gossip. Not unless it was serious. My fingers hovered over the message.
I tapped the link.
The browser started loading. My heart pounded so loud I could barely hear anything else. I paced the living room while I waited, rubbing my fingers against my forehead.
The screen lit up slowly. First the headline.

“Prominent Businessman Spotted Getting Cozy With Mystery Woman at Rooftop Lounge”

I blinked.
My hands started to shake. I scrolled down, my breath catching in my throat.
The page was still loading the image.
Part of it came into view the back of a man in a suit. He was leaning in close to a woman with long dark hair, her lips almost touching his cheek. The rest was blurry.
I stared. My brain started screaming at me to stop. But I couldn’t. I needed to know.
Suddenly, a message from Tessa popped up again.
Tess💗: “Lauren… I think it’s Ethan. I’m so sorry.”
I sat down hа'rd-on the couch. My legs couldn’t hold me anymore. My heart was pounding in my chest like it was trying to break free.
Please, God, don’t let it be him, I whispered inside my head.
The image was still loading, slowly getting clearer. I could make out more of the man’s jaw now. The angle of his chin. The curve of his ear.
I knew that face. I knew it like the back of my hand.

It was Ethan.

My heart dropped. It felt like someone had reached into my chest and squeezed it until it cracked. I covered my mouth with both hands. Tears spilled down my cheeks before I even realized I was crying. The kind of crying that just… happens. Quiet. Shocked. Crushed.
The article said it was taken just a few hours ago. Tonight. 
The smudge on his collar wasn’t just some Silly accident but it came from the mysterious woman whose face hadn’t been clearly captured.
I leaned forward, elbows on my knees, phone still glowing in my hands.
How could he? How could he do this to Elena? To me? After everything? After the sacrifices I made for him to build that company that made him who he is now. 
Then I heard a soft, small sound. Like a whisper.
“Mommy?”
I froze and looked up. Elena was standing on the stairs, hugging her teddy bear, eyes wide with worry.
“Mommy… why are you crying?”

LAUREN’S POV

I wiped my cheeks fast and tried to smile. I didn’t want Elena to worry.
“Just something in Mommy’s eye,” I said softly.
She didn’t look convinced, but she nodded and came down slowly, hugging her teddy bear tight. She climbed onto the couch beside me and leaned her little head on my shoulder. I held her close, breathing in her soft baby shampoo scent, trying to hold myself together.
“Did Daddy come home already?” she whispered.
I swallowed the lump in my throat. “Yeah… he’s upstairs. He didn't want to wake you when he came in."" I lied. 
Ethan didn't even attempt to go into her room and at least check on her.
She didn’t say anything after that. Just sat there quietly until her eyes started to droop again. I carried her to her room and tucked her in gently. 
I kissed her forehead and whispered, “I love you more than anything, baby.”
When she was finally asleep, I went into the master bedroom. Ours. Well, used to be ours.
The bed still looked neat, untouched — Ethan hadn’t slept in it for weeks now. He said he needed space. Said work was too stressful, and he didn’t want to keep me up when he came in late.
I sat down on the edge of the bed, staring at the floor. My chest felt tight, and the remaining tears I’d held back because of Elena's presence came rushing in like a storm.
I curled up, pulled the blanket around me, and let it out. Silent, broken sobs that hurt deep in my ribs. The kind that no one hears. The kind that makes you feel completely alone.
I cried until the pillow was wet. I must’ve fallen asleep sometime after three or four. The sky was already starting to brighten when I finally closed my eyes.
When I opened them again, the room was filled with soft daylight. My head felt heavy. My eyes were swollen. I reached for my phone to check the time. It was past 10.
I sat up slowly, brushed my hair back, and went downstairs.
The house was quiet.
“Mrs. Lauren,” Rosa said gently from the kitchen. “I took Elena to school. You were sleeping so deeply, I didn’t want to wake you.”
I nodded. “Thank you, Rosa.”
She gave me a small smile and kept wiping down the counter. I walked into the living room and saw her tidying up. That’s when she noticed something on the coffee table.
“Oh,” she said, picking it up. “This looks like Mr. Ethan’s.”
I looked closer. It was his silver USB drive — the one he always kept on his keychain. He used it for work. Always said it had important files on it.
Rosa frowned. “He must’ve dropped it.”
Right then, her phone buzzed. She answered quickly, nodding as she spoke in Spanish. Then she turned to me. “That was Mr. Ethan. He asked if we had seen the USB. I told him yes.”
“And?”
“He said I should drop it off at the office and leave it at the front desk.”
I stayed quiet for a second. He had to call the maid instead of his wife — I was used to it by now. It wasn’t like it was anything new. ‘I’ll take it,’ I said.
Rosa looked surprised. “Are you sure?”
I nodded. “Yeah. I’ll go.”
She didn’t ask any questions. Just handed it to me and said, “Be careful, Mrs. Lauren.”
I went upstairs, got dressed slowly in jeans, blouse, nothing fancy. Just enough to look presentable. My hands shook a little as I brushed my hair.
I drove to Ethan’s office. My fingers gripped the steering wheel too tight the whole time. I kept thinking about that photo from last night. That soft pink lipstick. The way he had lied and made me feel crazy for asking.
When I walked through the glass doors of the building, and got to the CEO level the front desk secretary looked up and froze for a second. She clearly recognized me. Her smile was tight and nervous.
“Mrs. Black,” she said. “Uh… Mr. Black is in a meeting right now.”
I tilted my head. “Is that so?”
“Yes, he’s...he’s not available at the moment. And he asked not to be interrupted. But I take your message, if you like. And inform him when he's done.""
Her voice was polite, but the look in her eyes wasn’t. It was like she was trying to warn me. Like she knew something and didn’t want me to go any further.
But I didn’t stop. I didn’t even answer her. I walked past her and opened the door to Ethan’s office.
And there he was sitting on the couch, relaxed, smiling. Sitting right next to him, too close, was a woman I didn’t recognize at first.
She was laughing softly, her hand resting on his arm like it belonged there. Like it had been there a hundred times before.
My heart dropped.
He didn’t even hear me come in at first. He looked up when the woman paused mid-laugh and glanced toward the door.
When our eyes met, something in his face shifted — not guilt, not shame. Just surprise. Like I’d interrupted something slightly inconvenient.
But it was the woman who held my focus.
Her face. Her eyes. The way she tilted her head when she smiled — something about it felt familiar.
And then it hit me.

College.

Ethan's ex-girlfriend Sofia Crane. The popular girl Ethan used to be crazy about. The one he always chased until she left him high and dry. Back then, she had everything — beauty, money, connections.
I remember hoping she’d stay gone. After she broke up with him and made him the talk of the school then. That she’d never come back into his life. And now here she was.
Sitting next to my husband in such an intimate position.
Everything inside me turned cold. My hands clenched the USB so tight I thought I’d snap it in two.

LAUREN’S POV

Ethan looked up, his smile dropping fast. He frowned, like he was annoyed. Like I was the one doing something wrong.
“What are you doing here, Lauren?” he asked, standing up slowly. He didn’t even look surprised to see me. No smile, no warmth, just those cold, annoyed brown eyes.
I held up the USB, my hands trembling. “You left this,” I said, forcing the words out of my mouth.
“I told Rosa to bring it,” he said sharply. “Not you. You shouldn't have bothered coming.""
That was the first thing he said. Not thank you. Not are you okay? Not even a quick lie to pretend he cared about my feelings. No, he was mad that I came instead of the maid.
I blinked, staring at him. “That’s what you’re upset about?”
He said nothing. Just stood there, his jaw tight.
Before I could say another word, the lady sitting beside him spoke.

“Ethan… who is she?”

Her voice was smooth, soft, almost mocking. I turned to look at her. She crossed her legs slowly, like she was in no rush. Her nails were painted a pale pink, and the way she looked at me made my skin crawl.
Ethan didn’t answer right away. I turned to him, heart pounding in my chest, waiting for him to speak. But he just opened his mouth, then closed it again.
So I answered for him.
“I’m his wife,” I said quietly. I held up my left hand and showed her the ring.
But then I looked down at Ethan’s hand. It was bare. No ring. No sign he’d ever worn one to work.
My chest felt like it cracked open. That moment hit me so hard, I almost forgot to breathe.
“Oh,” the woman said, blinking at me. “You didn’t mention a wife last night when I asked you.”
Last night.
Those two words echoed in my head. Then it clicked, she was the same woman from the photo. The lipstick. The lie. The intern at the company he said not to worry about. It was her. He was with her.
My throat burned.
Ethan must’ve seen it in my face, the way I finally put it all together. That’s when he quickly stepped in.
“Yes, I’m married,” he said, like it was suddenly important now. “This is Lauren. My wife. Lauren, this is Sofia...an old friend from college.”

Sofia.

I already knew. But hearing the name out loud still made my stomach twist.
Sofia turned back to me, and for a few seconds, she just looked. Up and down. Her eyes sharp. Her mouth curled into the smallest smirk as her eyes dragged over my outfit, my hair, my body. She wasn't even subtle about it.
Then she laughed. Just a little.
“Wow! I honestly can’t believe it,” she said, almost like she was talking to herself. “Ethan… really? This is who you ended up with?”
I felt the burn in my face. ""Excuse me?” I said, my voice tight.
She kept smiling like I wasn’t even worth being mad at.
“I mean, no offense,” she said with a shrug, even though offense was clearly the point. "" She's not what I expected. Did you stop caring about appearances completely? She's... so plain. And you’ve gained a lot of weight, haven’t you? You could’ve at least dressed up properly before coming here.”

I froze.

I turned to Ethan. Waiting. Begging silently for him to say something. To tell her to shut her mouth. To defend me, just once.
But he didn’t.
No ""Don't talk to her like that.""
Instead, his face… his face said everything. He was embarrassed of me.
The same man who used to kiss my stretch marks and say they were proof I brought our daughter into the world… now looked like he didn’t even want to be seen beside me.
I looked down at my outfit.
Jeans, blouse, nothing fancy but clean, neat, decent. I wasn’t trying to impress anyone. I came here to drop off his stubid USB, not walk a red carpet.
And no...I wasn’t skinny like I used to be in college. I had a child. I had a life. And I was tired. But I wasn’t ugly. I wasn’t nothing.
I looked up at Ethan again. “You’re really going to let her talk to me like that?”
He didn’t answer.
I felt my knees go weak, but I stayed standing. I wouldn’t cry in front of her. I wouldn’t give her that.
My mind started spinning, pulling me back to college. Back to when it all started.
I was just the quiet transfer student on scholarship. Ethan and Sofia were the golden couple back then. Everyone knew them. They were rich, good-looking, and popular.
Until his family lost their money. And she dropped him like he was trash. I still remember how bad he took it. The whispers in the hallway. The pity. The gossip.
I had liked Ethan then quietly from afar. I never expected him to notice me but one day, he did. He asked me out. Took me for coffee. Talked to me like I mattered. I thought… maybe he was different.
Now here we were.

Full circle.

Sofia was back, sitting in his office like she never left. Like I never existed.
And yeah, maybe I had gained a little weight. But I had also grown a life inside me. Carried our daughter, stayed up through fevers and nightmares, and ran a home while he “worked late.”
Ethan used to say he liked me this way. He used to tell me I didn’t need to lose a pound. “You’re perfect the way you are,” he’d say. “Don’t stress yourself.”
So why was he quiet now?
Why did he look like he agreed with everything Sophia just said?
I held onto my pride and tried to keep my voice from shaking.
“Why are you even here?” I asked, my voice steady. “Why are you sitting this close to my husband? Acting like you belong here?”
She smiled again, but this time, it wasn’t playful. It was cold.
“I have every right to be close to Ethan,” she said simply.
Then she leaned back against the couch like she was on a talk show.
“And,” she added, dragging the word out slowly, “I’m pregnant.”
The room spun.
My legs felt like jelly.
I blinked at her. “What?”
“I’m expecting Lauren,” she said, placing a hand on her flat stomach. The smirk on her face turned smug. ""Ethan’s baby.”

LAUREN’S POV

Pregnant.

That word rang in my ears over and over again like a siren. My brain heard it, but my heart… my heart refused to believe it.
I turned slowly, like my whole body had forgotten how to move. My eyes landed on Ethan. He wasn’t looking at me. He was staring at the floor like a boy caught stealing. My lips parted, and my voice came out so weak, I barely recognized it.
“Ethan… is it true?”
I prayed – God, I actually prayed in that second that he would look up and say no. That Sofia was just playing a sick joke. That it was a lie. That he didn’t do this to me. To us. To our daughter.
But he didn’t even lift his head. He didn’t say a single word. His jaw clenched, his eyes flicked to the side like a coward, and in that second… I knew. He didn’t have to say anything. His silence hit harder than a slap.
It was true.
She wasn’t lying. Sofia was actually pregnant with his child. And I...his wife was standing there like a fool. Like a leftover.
Something inside me cracked. I could feel it. It started small, like a pinch in my chest, then it spread like fire across my whole body. My stomach twisted. My throat tightened. My legs felt weak. I didn’t cry. I didn’t scream. I just… broke quietly.
In a daze, I turned around and walked out of his office. I didn’t say goodbye. I didn’t wait for an explanation. I didn’t even look back.
Each step felt like dragging cement. My heels tapped against the marble floor, too loud in the silence. The hallway spun a little, but I didn’t slow down. I needed to get out. I needed to breathe.
“Ma’am?” Ethan’s secretary stood up as I passed by. Her face looked worried. She probably saw everything. I could see it in her eyes. Pity.
“Are you alright?”
I didn’t answer. I couldn’t. My voice had gone missing. I kept walking, fast, like maybe if I moved fast enough, none of this would be real.
I reached the elevator and pressed the button with a shaking hand. But after a second, I stepped away. I couldn’t just stand there. I couldn’t be still. I felt like I was going to explode.
Without thinking, I turned and pushed open the stairwell door. One step. Then another. I gripped the railing like it was the only thing holding me up.
Down. Down. Just keep going down.
I burst through the exit door and into the sunlight. The bright light hit me like a slap. I blinked hard, trying to adjust, but the world kept spinning. I reached into my bag for my car keys. My hands were shaking so much I dropped them.
“No, no, no…” I whispered to myself as I knelt down and picked them up.
I stood there for a second. My car was just a few steps away, but I couldn’t move. My chest was too tight. My breathing too shallow. My body frozen.
I couldn’t drive. I couldn’t even stand up straight. So I walked.
I didn’t know where I was going. I just turned and walked away from the building. Away from Ethan. Away from the woman carrying his child. Away from the life I thought I had.
People passed me on the street. Cars honked. I didn’t see their faces. Didn’t hear their voices. Everything was muffled and distant.
I kept walking.
Her voice kept echoing in my head. “I’m pregnant.”
And him… the man who swore he’d love me forever. The man I gave up my whole career for, picking up extra shifts so he could build the company he dreamed of – Black Enterprise. The same man who kissed my belly when I was pregnant with Elena and whispered, “You’re my home.” He said nothing. Not even I’m sorry. Not even a lie to hold onto.
Just silence.
My feet hurt. My heels rubbed raw against my skin. My blouse clung to my back with sweat. But I didn’t stop.
I couldn’t.
Because if I stopped, I’d have to think. And if I thought, I’d have to feel. And if I felt… I’d fall apart.
I reached a corner and leaned against a lamppost. My hand gripped the cold metal, trying to stay upright.
The world tilted.
My knees buckled a little. I blinked fast. Everything was spinning. My heart pounded in my ears. My stomach turned. I swallowed hard, but it didn’t help.
Then everything went black.
I don’t remember falling. Just that my body gave up. Gave in. But I didn’t hit the ground.
Someone caught me. Strong arms wrapped around me, lifting me gently.
“It’s okay. I’ve got you. You’re alright.”
The voice was deep.
My head rested against a chest. I could feel the warmth through his shirt. I wanted to ask who he was. I wanted to see his face.
But I couldn’t open my eyes. I was so tired.
“Stay with me,” he said softly.
I tried to speak, but my lips wouldn’t move. Everything felt heavy. My arms. My legs. Even my tears were stuck.
He carried me. I didn’t know where. I didn’t care.
I let myself go.
All I remember is the way he held me – like I still mattered. Like I wasn’t just someone left behind.",1,1758043075.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False

1nink6t,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1nink6t/showcase_best_espresso_machine_options_with/,Showcase best espresso machine options with Kismile review inside,"The Kismile Espresso Machine with Grinder is a shiny piece of coffee artistry that recently made its way onto my kitchen counter. With its sleek stainless steel design and built-in bells and whistles like a grinder, milk frother, and 20-bar pump, this machine seems to promise that sweet café-quality coffee right in the comfort of your home. I've had it up and running for over a month now, so here's my honest take on the experience.

**Design and Build Quality**

Visually, this coffee maker is a stunner. It’s compact enough to fit comfortably on my countertop, but it still has a decent heft that makes it feel durable. The stainless steel finish doesn’t just look premium but is easy to wipe down after coffee splatters and milk frothing experiments that might go slightly awry. Buttons and knobs are neatly laid out and have this satisfying tactile feel—it’s clear some thought was put into user interaction here. The removable 2.8-liter water tank, though bulky, is a practical feature. Plus, the drip tray is easy to remove and clean, which my weekend-cleaning self deeply appreciates.

**Ease of Use**

Setting up the machine was mostly intuitive, although I had to glance at the manual a couple of times to figure out the grinder settings (there are 30 presets!). While I consider myself a decently tech-savvy coffee lover, the learning curve was a little steeper than I’d prefer. Brewing coffee, however, is straightforward, with single and double-shot buttons simplifying the process. I love how I can customize my extraction and grind size—ideal for days when I want to channel my inner barista (or just need that stronger caffeine kick). Speaking of grinders, the built-in conical burr grinder performs beautifully, ensuring each bean is ground with precision and care.

**Barista-Level Coffee at Home**

One of the machine's major selling points for me is the 20-bar Italian pump paired with a 1500W motor. Talk about pressure! This setup extracts coffee with a deliciously rich crema that feels straight out of a high-end café. I’ve tried it with espresso shots, lattes, and cappuccinos, and it hasn’t disappointed me yet. The PID temperature control feature kept my brew consistent and perfect every time, even if I was juggling a morning rush. For espresso aficionados, this consistency is gold.

**Milk Frothing and Hot Water Perks**

I had serious fun experimenting with the milk frother. It creates velvety foam for cappuccinos and silky microfoam for lattes, making it easy to experiment with latte art—even if my creations resembled abstract blobs. The dual-purpose steam wand also lets me dispense hot water for my occasional tea cravings or Americano afternoons. However, one thing I quickly realized: keeping that steam wand clean requires diligence. Thankfully, the hot water function acts as a cleaning aid, flushing out any sticky milk residues.

**Highlights**

- Barista-quality coffee from the comfort of home  
- Built-in conical burr grinder with 30 grind settings for precise customization  
- Milk frother creates excellent foam – great for latte lovers  
- 20-bar pump extracts rich, flavorful espresso with ample crema  
- Compact design with a removable water tank and drip tray for extra convenience  

**Drawbacks**

While impressive, the machine does have its quirks:  

- The grinder settings might overwhelm beginners (who knew I’d spend 10 minutes debating between grind numbers!)  
- Steam wand cleaning is a bit high maintenance  
- It’s not as whisper-quiet as I’d hoped—the grinder, in particular, makes its presence known  

**Competitors**

In terms of peers, I’ve also tried models like the Breville Barista Express and the De’Longhi Dedica. The Breville leans towards slightly more polished finishes and advanced programmability but lacks the price accessibility of this one. The De’Longhi Dedica, on the other hand, is slimmer and more minimalist, but it doesn’t offer the built-in grinder or the robust 20-bar pressure. This Kismile machine feels like the sweet spot between affordability and compelling features, though it might be a tad noisier when compared side by side.

**Quality for Price**

This machine packs a punch for what it offers in its price range. Between the all-in-one functionality, café-quality results, and durability, it’s a solid investment—especially for casual coffee lovers like me who aren’t ready (or willing) to shell out for those premium, big-brand machines. The grinder and milk frother alone save you from buying separate accessories, adding to its cost-efficiency. Although the grinder takes some getting used to and the noise level could be improved, I’d still say this machine brings more to the table than it takes away.

1ninj5r,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ninj5r,Pemi Loop CCW 9/13,"It's been a couple of days now, and every 20 minutes or so I catch myself going back to thinking, “Oh hell yeah!”

I had an incredible solo day out on the loop. I set an alarm for 3:30 AM and started from the trailhead at 4:28 AM, aiming to reach the summit of Bondcliff by 6:23 AM for the sunrise. I aimed to be at Galehead at roughly 4 hours and finished the hike at 2:39 PM.

I had created two pace charts for myself: one overly ambitious (8 hours) and another more realistic (10 hours). On the overly ambitious chart, I had at least one ridiculous split target (from Galehead to the top of Garfield in 30 minutes, what was I thinking?). This was because I had done a lot of my planning in a rush the two nights before. I ended up going 10 minutes over the more realistic target. If I hadn’t needed to stop to patch a wound, I would have probably hit my target.

The temperature range was probably between 45–60°F when I was out there. It was mostly overcast, and there wasn’t much direct sunlight. This was pretty much ideal for me. I wore a jacket, gloves, and sleeves for the first hour, but then I went the rest of the day in shorts and a tee. (I was also carrying leggings, long sleeve shirt, and emergency bivy and a second pair of gloves for safety.)

It was dry out there, but the cooler temperature meant that I managed with the liquids I carried from the beginning. I refilled my fluids (4 x 500 ml + 1 x 650 ml) at Galehead hut. If I had been purely running, I would have consumed much more, but the slower pace over the technical terrain in this temperature clearly meant that I was sweating less and thus needed less liquid. I was thinking of grabbing 500 ml of water from Garfield spring, but it was just a drizzle and I chose to just go with what I was carrying. Afterward, I heard Liberty spring was also slow, taking a good 10 minutes to get 1000 ml of a refill.

I ate a total of about 2500 calories in the first 7 hours. Then, I hit palate fatigue, which was like crashing into a brick wall and spitting out some of my gel — not by choice. After that, I just had half a fig bar and ran on fumes. I was carrying alternative snacks, and with a clear mind, I would have probably taken the time to switch them to an easily accessible pocket. I don’t do many 6+ hour efforts every year, so learning where my limits are with this is a bit slow.

For me, the crux of the loop was probably the section from Galehead to the top of Garfield. Not because of how challenging it is, but rather for my silly miscalculation and feeling demoralized by that. I didn’t really experience any major challenges — small scratches, that one patched wound, and a tiny tumble on the last mile were the only real issues. I'm very glad I carried a small first aid kit as I always do on my longer runs. It might be worth noting that band aids were absolutely useless, and I needed to use a lot of moleskin to patch a tiny wound on my fingertip. Sweat doesn't go well with adhesive materials.

In preparation for this single day effort, we did a two day hike last fall, and honestly I believe that’s an ideal way to experience the Pemi Loop. It allows for more time to take breaks, enjoy the views, listen to the birds and savor a cup of coffee and noodles on a mountaintop. 

A couple of days later, I’m still feeling quite sore, but also filled with deep gratitude and appreciation for the mountains. I can’t wait to do the loop again, both clockwise and repeating the counter-clockwise effort. And while the Pemi Loop itself is amazing, I still have so many more of the 48 to visit. Very excited for it all, and looking forward to more.

1nini7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HotColdTruth/comments/1nini7l/should_you_buy_the_bosch_hmd8451uc_microwave/,Should You Buy the Bosch HMD8451UC Microwave Drawer Today,"Bosch HMD8451UC Microwave Drawer came into my life as part of a kitchen renovation, and testing it daily has given me a detailed perspective on how it fits into the lives of average home cooks. This sleek, stainless steel microwave drawer claims to be both a space-saver and a high-performing essential. With its automatic sensor programs, touch open/close feature, and 950 cooking watts spread across 10 power levels, the microwave certainly positions itself as a premium appliance. While it impressed me in several areas, there are both bright spots and some room for improvement. Here’s a breakdown of my experience.

**Design and Aesthetics**  
Its design was the first detail that caught my attention. The Bosch HMD8451UC fits seamlessly into cabinetry and offers a flush installation. Its stainless steel exterior gives off a modern, professional kitchen vibe that friends and family immediately noticed during visits. The LCD white display alongside glass touch controls feels futuristic and ensures it doesn’t just settle for looking good but also being easy to operate. I found the touch open/close feature refreshingly smooth—you need just one push for the drawer to glide open like magic. However, some users might find its size a bit restrictive depending on their kitchens. At 23.87 x 23.37 x 16.31 inches and weighing 81 pounds, it requires some careful measurement prior to installation. Trust me, hauling it into place is no small feat, but once it’s set, it transforms the room.  

**Ease of Use**  
This microwave drawer adds simplicity to cooking. With 10 power levels and automatic sensor programs, adjusting settings felt intuitive rather than a chore. My teenager, who usually avoids kitchen duties, even managed to reheat leftovers without calling me for help. It's these small wins in daily life that set it apart from traditional countertop or over-the-range microwaves. Even warming beverages like coffee fits in perfectly, as the cooking power makes it efficient but not overpowering for delicate items.

**Highlights**  
- Sleek and modern stainless steel design  
- Automatic drawer open/close feature  
- Automatic sensor programs simplify cooking  
- 950 watts with 10 adjustable power levels  
- LCD white display with glass touch controls

**Performance and Cooking Capability**  
Once installed, I began testing its cooking performance. The microwave’s 950 watts of power handled everything from frozen dinners to raw vegetables evenly, leaving evenly-cooked results almost every time. Popcorn nights were a breeze, as the preset programs detected the perfect timing for buttery explosions. A single-piece pizza reheated beautifully, maintaining both its crisp edges and gooey center. However, handling lumpier or larger items like soups in odd containers sometimes felt tricky due to the drawer-style design. Cleaning was straightforward, though, which made spillages much less annoying.

**Areas of Concern**  
- Large bowls feel restrictive in the drawer design  
- The price point would have been more competitive with features like Wi-Fi compatibility  
- Compared to some countertop options, figuring out initial placement takes time  

**Competing Products**  
I’ve also compared this appliance to other microwave models such as the Sharp KB-6524PS and KitchenAid KMBP100ESS. While the Sharp model offers a similar drawer feature, its overall design feels less premium than Bosch’s attention to detail. KitchenAid’s alternative shares the upscale vibe but comes at a significantly higher cost. Both competitors also lack the same seamless touch opening Bosch includes, which has become my favorite convenience. However, I'm being honest here, and some units offer better app connectivity or advanced features for tech-savvy users.

**Cost-Effectiveness**  
Considering its sleek design, effective cooking power, and build quality, this microwave justifies a space in modern kitchens, especially those aiming for a streamlined look. However, its price can be a hurdle for budget-conscious buyers who don’t want to splurge solely on looks and brand. For those like me who appreciate its ability to combine form and function, I believe it is worth it. But if you’re not looking for the drawer style, there could be cheaper options available that still get the job done on a simpler level.

TODAY'S 🎙SHOW: Douglas Tuman interviews Dr. K, a proof-of-work researcher with over eight years of experience. They dive into Monero’s ongoing “qubic attack,” where mining pool Qubic controls ~35% of the network’s hash rate and causes chain reorganizations.

Dr. K, whose background spans ConsenSys, Grid Plus (creator of the Lattice One wallet), and a National Science Foundation grant for PoW research, proposes a fix: work shares. By sampling multiple proofs per block instead of one, work shares make the network resistant to attacks from miners with less than 51% hash power. Dr. K is already drafting a pull request to add this to Monero’s code.The discussion also explores why Dr. K views proof-of-work as superior to proof-of-stake—emphasizing immutability, permissionlessness, and competitive fairness—and his own project, Quiet Network (QUI), a scalable PoW blockchain with an energy-based token (QI) designed for stable purchasing power.

And wow I’ve been drinking piss this entire time and no one told me. 



Whole beans are just so much better. Yeah, sure you have to grind them first and all that, but honestly a grinder’s like 25 bucks on Amazon (didn’t pitch for an expensive m=one, since even the coffeemaker’s cheapish). Gamechanger. 



The thing is I’ve tried a couple of random small bags (you guessed it, they’re from costco) and I’m already noticing the difference. But now I wanna get serious about this stuff. Did a little Reddit deep dive before this and came up with [Caffe Borbone](https://videoguidelines.com/dp-B0CCVRNF2J). Here to provide a little context and ask for more reccs. 



Reasons I wanna try Caffe Borbone: 



1. It has some floral notes (Arabica beans) and I’m so curious cos I’ve tried fruity and they’ve been a little bit citrusy so wanna taste the difference. From what I’ve tried in coffee shops, I think floral notes might be more to my taste. 
2. Medium Roast. This I know for sure that I’m only into medium roast coffee, light roast espressos taste like water to me and dark ones are like tar. 
3. Italian. Leaning towards Italian coffees, they seem to have good reviews online and on r/coffee especially for beginners. 
4. Cheap. I know its another mass produced bag, but that makes it cheaper and that’s unfortunately something I have to keep in mind for now. And for the price, I think it's a pretty good deal, considering its not from a big chain that’s selling me idek what in the name of coffee. Been hearing good things about Illy and Lavazza too btw. 



Reasons I haven’t tried Caffe Borbone yet: 

1. I’m fully broke. I wanna invest in a good 2 pound bag to last me a while and it’s not feasible to go around trying $50 bags to see whether I like it or not, so I’m here to gain some more reccs before I settle on one. 



And PLEASE no one recc anything from local roasters, trust me there are none in my area, I’m in the backend of nowhere so Amazon is really the only option and keep the reccs affordable please.

However, we were doing a group activity last month and hence had to formally introduce ourselves to each other. There it was revealed that we both have the same first language and are from the same town. After work that day we talked about ourselves, it was more like a warm discussion between two people living far away from their homes about their homeland in their native tongues. Few days later we again met each other and he talked to me. Then again, and again. One day it was raining a lot and we had a break. He asked me if I wanted to have coffee with him and his friend (who canceled right after, it seemed like they both knew that he'd cancel) and I politely declined because I had some work to do.

But that day I started having the fear that he probably knew that I liked him. In our group project, he has been way too nice to me. Yesterday I saw him at work and he came up to talk to me. His eyes got brighter and all, he started smiling a lot. 

The fact that he wants to talk so much to me scares me. He's beyond my league. I'd have never told him that I liked him. What if he is doing all this to find out the truth and then brutally turn me down? ",1,1758042679.0,Crush,0,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**  


It looks like the Giants will play a bullpen game this evening, friends. And comically, all of Eduardo Rodriguez’s (4.98 ERA) last 5 starts have seen the Diamondbacks put at least 5 runs in the bag (even in a loss!) While Rodriguez’s last outing against San Francisco was solid, he tends to be worse at home than he is on the road, and the Giants seem pretty eager to lock down that last Wild Card spot. I expect Arizona to put up runs in the first 5 innings, and the Giants to excel once the home squad’s bullpen takes over. Lastly, the last 5 straight SF bullpen games have seen the Over cash, so that’s where I’ll put my money today. I’m on Over 9 to hit.

1nincus,https://www.reddit.com/r/EverydayTechTried/comments/1nincus/should_you_buy_the_best_singleserve_brewer/,Should You Buy the Best Single-Serve Brewer Nespresso Vertuo Next,"Testing the Nespresso ENV120BCA Vertuo Next coffee and espresso machine has been like welcoming a small café into my kitchen. It’s not just a machine; it’s part of my morning routine, an afternoon ritual, or a late-night indulgence. Designed with elegance and functionality, it's stylishly compact with its black and rose gold trim. Its sleek appearance blends seamlessly in any kitchen setup, but make no mistake, this machine isn’t just sitting pretty—it delivers the goods.

**Design and Build Quality**  
At first glance, the slim design might seem too petite for a machine that promises seven coffee sizes, but don’t let that fool you. With dimensions of 15.08""D x 5.59""W x 12.8""H, it fits snugly on countertops without occupying much space. The quality is impressive; the machine is crafted using 50% recycled plastic, giving it a sustainable edge. The shiny rose gold details paired with matte black accents make it look modern yet chic. It carries just the right blend of sturdiness and style. Even my sister, a sworn minimalist, gave it a nod of approval when she passed through last week.

**Ease of Use**  
The fully automatic operation and one-button functionality make it laughably easy to brew coffee. I plopped in a capsule on a groggy Monday morning, pressed the button, and voilà! Magic in a cup within minutes. The capsules are ejected automatically after brewing, sparing me the mess or fuss of cleanup. My teenager was initially unimpressed by yet ""another gadget,"" but now even she uses it daily before grabbing her backpack and rushing to catch the school bus.

[Check Nespresso ENV120BCA price on Amazon.](https://triopd.com/p/b0866qtz3n/)

**An Array of Coffee Options**  
This machine’s versatility has been my personal highlight. It handles seven different cup sizes, from Ristretto shots to a generously large carafe style. Whether I’m gulping a quick espresso shot to shake myself awake or lounging with a pour-over-style coffee on a Sunday morning, it meets every mood. I particularly appreciated the natural crema it produces atop every cup, something my old coffee maker just couldn’t deliver. The included assortment of Vertuo capsules was a pleasant surprise; the assortment gave me the chance to try their range, although I’ve already developed a soft spot for their caramel notes.

**Advantages**  
Some of the winning points of this machine are:  
- Simple one-button operation eliminates any guesswork.  
- Seven different cup size options cater to every coffee preference.  
- Capsules are recyclable, making the machine a greener choice.  
- Compact but still sturdy—doesn’t wobble or shift during operation.  

**Downsides**  
Like all good things in life, there are areas for improvement, and this machine isn’t an exception.  
- The capsules are only compatible with Nespresso’s Vertuo line, locking you into their ecosystem.  
- It’s not the quietest brewer, especially for a morning routine in a house full of light sleepers.  
- Software updates require a Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connection, which might feel overly complicated for some.  

**Innovative Tech Features**  
The inclusion of smart technology like Bluetooth and Wi-Fi seems over-the-top at first, especially for something as straightforward as coffee brewing, but I’ve found it surprisingly useful. The automatic software updates ensure that the machine constantly adapts to improve itself. These updates guarantee an optimal brewing process. It’s like having a barista that upgrades with each use!

**Product Contenders**  
While the Vertuo Next impressed me with its sleek design and multi-cup options, it does face stiff competition in the single-serve brewer market. Machines like the Keurig K-Elite are its closest rivals. Keurig offers broader pod accessibility and a slightly faster brew time, but what it lacks is crema, and the coffee quality isn’t as rich or layered. On the higher-end scale, Breville's Bambino might woo espresso purists, delivering detailed controls, but it doesn’t diversify with various cup sizes. The Vertuo Next strikes an excellent balance by offering premium coffee quality in different cup styles while being exceptionally easy to use.

**Smart Spending**  
For anyone debating its cost-efficiency versus features, I can assure you it’s a fair trade-off. Sure, its capsules don’t come at bargain bin prices, but the coffee’s quality rivals what you’d sip at your local café. Plus, factoring in its sustainability credentials, lightweight build, and auto-update features, it stands out as a worthwhile investment for coffee lovers.

I should preface this by saying I don't often go to the Tesco Extra (big Tesco) in my city these days, but I still do the main groceries there occasionally. When I do, I tend to use the ""Scan as you Shop"" option. I've done this in the same store many times in the past decade, especially when I did my main shop there most weeks. Sometimes I'm subject to the random checks when making payment. Fair enough, loss prevention, got to be done. In the past when I have been randomly selected, they will scan 2-5 items, check my trolley over, and key in their employee code. However, I went for groceries today and was really surprised by the checks carried out.

Having finished my shopping, I scanned the barcode at the checkout and it flagged for a check. An employee came over and scanned the screen. He then said he needed to check TWENTY-ONE ITEMS. I thought I'd heard him wrong at first, but he proceeded to root through my - already bagged - groceries scanning items. I was standing there awkwardly and eventually asked ""do you have to check so many items each time?"", more to make small talk than anything. He just said ""yes, you have 42 items, I need to scan half.""
He proceeded to scan several items from all of my pre-packed bags until his scanner pinged. He keyed in information on the screen and walked away without saying anything. 

I'm not complaining, I'm just interested to know why so many items had to be scanned? I understand that companies have to implement loss prevention strategies, but re-scanning 21 items on a shop totalling over £90 seems a bit much. I may as well have not bothered with scan as you shop. The staff member also took several items out of the bags and didn't put them back.

I'd be really interested to know if there are certain flags in Tesco security systems that prompt. I presume such a large brand takes significant security measures. I wasn't buying anything expensive or unusual, no non-food items other than a toilet roll and some face wipes. There was some meat and cheese, but not more than £30 worth. I did buy some alcohol (beer) but this wasn't scanned during checks and I was deemed ""clearly over 25"", so I can't see this being the reason. I also thought it might be because I removed an item I accidentally scanned twice, but that seems a bit far-fetched.

Perhaps I have simply been lucky in the past, but loss prevention checks seem to have ramped up a lot! 

I remember thinking similarly when they started putting those magnetic security tags on items like like meat and coffee in Tesco Express stores. Unfortunate that the current economic climate causes such measure to be taken by major brands, really.

I've been looking all over the internet but g00gle is broken af nowadays so I'm not getting any good results lol. 

My go-to recipe since I got my Bialetti has been 
1. Use whisk to mix moka and dark chocolate sauce
2. Pour over ice and milk 

So I wanna try to get a bit fancier with it! Like I said, I got some sweetened condensed milk, but I also got some pumpkin pie spice and cinnamon to maybe try adding them to my brewing blend? 


Note: I sadly don't have disposable income atm to get a frother or anything so I'm working with a whisk, my Bialetti, and dreams. ",12,1758042341.0,mokapot,2,0.93,False
1nin9wr,https://www.reddit.com/r/nursing/comments/1nin9wr/wage_theft/,WAGE THEFT,"I’m a nurse in Illinois and just ran into something that doesn’t sit right with me.

I had to complete mandatory training modules for work (took me about 2 hours). When I brought it up to my manager, they flat out told me I won’t be paid because I didn’t do it at work.

From what I understand, under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) and Illinois law, if training is mandatory and directly related to your job, it’s considered compensable time. It doesn’t matter if you do it in the hospital, at home, or in a coffee shop. If it’s required, it’s work.

Refusing to pay feels like wage theft, and I’m not okay with it.

I already documented the time and can show proof of completing the modules. I’m debating my next steps:
	•	Should I escalate this to HR/payroll first (instead of just my manager)?
	•	File a claim with the Illinois Department of Labor?
	•	Or go straight to the U.S. Department of Labor (Wage and Hour Division)?",4,1758042340.0,nursing,4,0.83,False

1nin5aa,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nin5aa,Review: OutIn Portable Electric Vacuum Coffee Canister,"

Hey everyone! How are you?

Is anyone on the sub interested in vacuum canisters? The OutIn canister wasn't my first vacuum canister, but it was my first with truly useful technology.

It uses an automatic vacuum monitoring system.
It maintains vacuum pressure, and when the pressure decreases, the system automatically reactivates to ensure an oxygen-free environment.

I had given up on vacuum canisters a while ago, as all the ones I'd used weren't 100% effective or required manual monitoring (from time to time, I had to check the canister, open it, pump it, turn the lid, etc.). Since I like convenience, I had simply given up on that until I got this one. You simply put your coffee beans in it and go about your life, without having to check every couple of days to see if the canister is doing its job. This is my personal opinion, but I enjoy a healthy relationship with my hobby.  I want to enjoy everything related to coffee. We already have enough problems and worries in life.

It's all very simple: You put your beans in the container, put the lid on, press a button, and wait 12 seconds. That's it. Your beans are sealed.

The design is, in my opinion, very attractive, and the quality is excellent (stainless steel, rubber, and BPA-free plastic). The matte ABS exterior is beautiful and high-quality; because it's steel, you don't need to worry about extreme care when handling it (of course, you won't abuse it and drop it off your counter, but it can handle a lot. Unlike glass containers, for example—and yes, OutIn also has a glass version, but I prefer this one, due to the points raised in the text). Also, because it's steel, the beans are protected from sunlight.

The unboxing experience is great too.  It comes well protected inside the box with foam inserts and comes with a measuring spoon and cable (as well as a manual and cover letter).

According to OutIn, the battery lasts between three and six months. I've been using it for about two months and haven't needed to charge it yet.

Okay, but does it work? It works! It truly preserves the aroma and quality of the beans. I use it and the original package. I use the beans from the original package, in which the roaster sends the coffee, first, and then the beans from the OutIn canister. The result: Fresh, fragrant, and new (without that stale bean experience).

Is there anything I'd like to see improved? Yes! The capacity. Since I use 1kg of coffee per month, it would be a dream to have this exact canister, with a 1kg capacity.  That said, this canister is functional, looks nice on the countertop, preserves the beans, doesn't require physical effort like others, and doesn't cause problems (we've seen cases of other brands' canisters that, unfortunately, have caused quite a few problems recently).

I really wish OutIn would make this canister with a 1kg capacity. That would be my only reservation (it holds about 130/140g). My guess is that OutIn designed the canister with outdoor use in mind (130g of fresh beans is a great lifesaver during a short trip). Now I just have to hope they release a larger version.

Oh, I almost forgot: I read some reviews complaining about a bug in it, and... It's not a bug. If you have this canister or plan to buy it, when opening it to remove the beans, follow these steps:

Press the middle button (OutIn logo), remove the lid, and before placing the lid on the counter, press the Power button so it doesn't go off at the wrong time.  I'll leave a photo, with the step-by-step instructions, attached here.

I tried to keep the analysis quick and objective, but if you have any questions, leave a question and I'll be happy to answer.


PS: I added an unboxing video and the ""trick"" to prevent the pot lid from coming off when you are going to use it. Here: https://youtu.be/m2eWv6brrec?si=8KrsX5EGoIv5jLzj",3,1758042064.0,OutInCoffee,0,1.0,False

1nin2ms,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverforty/comments/1nin2ms/not_dealing_with_rejection_well/,Not dealing with rejection well,"Hi all, I'm feeling quite down and was hoping for some support. Dating tends to put me in some very negative spirals where I doubt myself, it completely ruins my day. Below is a recent date I went on and the thoughts I had after:

I (41M) went on 2 dates with a woman who is 40 who I met on Hinge. We talked over the course of a day and she asked if I wanted to go on a date and said yes. We met for a coffee and I'd say it went well, we spent 3.5 hours together and talked about a lot of things. I was a bit nervous, but conversation flowed and I felt we had a lot of things in common.

After the date I text her and told her that I had a great time and would like to see her again and we went on a second date last week. We met more drinks for a couple of hours at a bar and then went to the cinema after, at the end of the date I went for a kiss and we kissed for about a minute or 2.

I text her when I got home that I had a nice time and hope she got home safe. She responded saying she got home safe and hopes I did too, but didn't say she had a good time which was a bit unnerving to me.

The next evening I ask her out again and she tells me she's not feeling a spark between us and that she thinks I'm a lovely person and that it's not about anything I did but that she just doesn't feel the connection.

Whenever things like this happen I tend not to believe what the person is saying and play back the date and think about what I did ""wrong"" to put her ""off"" me. These are 3 thing come to mind:

* At the bar the pint glass was wet and an odd shape and so it was difficult to hold and so there were times I had to grab it with 2 hands. Maybe it looked weird to her
* When we were at the cinema I had to leave to use the bathroom twice in the space of around 15–20 minutes as we had drunk a lot by that point. Maybe she thought ""why is he going to the bathroom so often"" and thought it was weird
* When we kissed I didn't do full on tongue, just a little bit, and it was gentle and soft. It didn't feel right to do a full on make out as we were in a busy subway station and also I don't know if she would have wanted that. But maybe that's what she wanted--a more intense kiss.

Unfortntaley, I suffer from anxiety and would say I'm not the most confident person and this is really having an impact on my mental health. I question everything I do, even kissing, which I've been doing since I was 17. How do I not be like this, I just want peace.

I am going to therapy and have been for a while. It has been helpful, but rejection is something I find extremely challenging to deal with.

Would really appreciate some advice. Thanks so much.

She has expressed for a long time wanting to get one for the routine of making coffee/drinks with one and getting into the hobby of it all, even though she's not one to drink coffee much.

She is the sort of person to really like learning all there is to something so I'd like to get her a machine within my budget that helps her learn how to make a coffee closest to what a much more expensive machine has to offer within my budget.

I've done a bit of my own research and with my limited understanding either finding a dual heating element machine such as the sunbeam duo espresso or a machine that let's the user or even requires the user to manually dial in as many possible settings (or whatever it's called for like steam heat and other coffee stuff) so she can properly learn the craft over relying on purely presets.

I am not fussed if the machine itself has a built in grinder or not, happy to get one separately if needed and would also love suggestions for those too.

My budget says $900ish because I am willing to go above that a little if the machine does all I'm asking for or if the machine itself is within budget but a grinder would take it above.

Thanks for anyone willing to help make a new coffee hobbyists out my partner.",1,1758041897.0,espresso,2,1.0,False

1nin2bj,https://www.reddit.com/r/publicdefenders/comments/1nin2bj/im_so_damn_sick_of_meth/,I’m so damn sick of meth,"I don’t know if this is a regional issue or what. But I practice in the rural south and meth is probably intertwined in the majority of my cases. Alcohol is too and that’s a different rant for a different day. 

I’m not straight edge. I’ve done some soft drugs in my day but of course never meth. And I’m so glad I never have. 

Meth makes you incompetent. I’ve looked it up, it essentially makes it impossible to gain dopamine naturally and for whatever reason that affects everything else. So you become irrational, forgetful, impulsive, you never think more than a few hours ahead. Your cognitive function goes out too and I’ve just seen become robots or a shell of a human. It’s like if a human was a computer and you stripped it of half of its programming, the part that makes it human. 

It’s so sad to see how it has destroyed hundreds of my clients over the years. They almost never stay clean and when they relapse they go freaking hard. The overdose rate for meth is low too. So you can go on for decades taking this shit. All the while your body and brain rot and you never really realize it. I’ve seen people blissfully unaware they are on meth. They let the officer search their bag, they take it to court, leave it out in plain view. 

I’m just so exhausted by it. They’re always the most difficult clients to reason with. They are late to court or don’t show up at all. They lie to your face. Honestly I genuinely don’t think half the time they realize they have even consumed it. They just do it and forget. And when they are on it they never stop talking, never let you get a word in or just yell. It’s like when you drink too much coffee and it makes you a little jittery and irritable but 1000 times worse. 

I got into this job for the same reasons you all did. I don’t support people going to prison for meth and I always fight the cases when we can, but what honestly is the solution here? What do we do? Do we force rehab? Do we make better efforts to stop it from coming in at the border? It seems like we are doing everything we can to keep this magical dust out of communities and it never stops. It’s endless. Each docket is a dozen meth cases. I’ve done so many meth cases I can’t keep track of them anymore. Literally hundreds. 

I’m just exhausted from all the suffering I see. Have things always been this way for the criminal system or is meth use worse than it was? I’m sorry I don’t even know what to say. ",62,1758041885.0,publicdefenders,36,0.98,False

1nimyzm,https://www.reddit.com/r/studytips/comments/1nimyzm/research_paper_writing_service_reviews_my/,Research Paper Writing Service Reviews: My Survival Guide as a Sleep-Deprived Student,"Okay, real talk: writing research papers is like wrestling a bear that also demands proper APA formatting. Between classes, work, and pretending I still have a social life, I hit the point where I needed outside help. Enter: research paper writing services.

I tested a few of the big names students always whisper about on Reddit and Discord. Below is my brutally honest breakdown of what worked, what didn’t, and who saved my GPA from becoming a cautionary tale.

# What I Looked For (a.k.a. My Dating Profile for Writing Services)

* Price – because my bank account is basically on life support.
* Speed – deadlines don’t care about your sleep schedule.
* Quality – I need research paper help, not ChatGPT-level word salad.
* Support – do they ghost you or actually respond?

# 1.[ SpeedyPaper](https://essay.watch/ktcZKP?type=8) – The Reliable Roommate

SpeedyPaper felt like that roommate who may not be glamorous, but always pays rent on time. Prices were reasonable, and the paper quality surprised me. The writer followed instructions down to the weird formatting quirks my professor loves.

✅ Pros:

* Fast turnaround (I got mine in under 48 hours).
* Helpful support team that didn’t sound like robots.
* Solid grammar and citations.  

❌ Cons:

* Website design looks like it’s from the early 2010s. Not a dealbreaker, but still.

👉 If you want consistency without drama, you can check them out here: speedypaper Definitely a top research paper writing service contender.

# 2.[ EssayMarket](https://essay.watch/FJqS9L?type=8) – The Underdog Surprise

I went in with low expectations but honestly, EssayMarket was the glow-up I didn’t see coming. It’s one of the research paper writing services that feels new but hungry to impress.

✅ Pros:

* Killer prices (student-budget friendly).Writer actually used peer-reviewed sources. Shocking, I know.
* Smooth ordering process.

❌ Cons:

* Took a bit longer than promised. Not tragic, but if you’re on a 24-hour deadline, keep that in mind.

👉 If you’re broke but still need research paper help, EssayMarket is worth a look: essaymarket.

# 3.[ WritePaperForMe](https://essay.watch/XLWkG7?type=8) – The Popular Kid

This one pops up in every “best research paper writing service” thread, so I gave it a shot. Verdict? Popular for a reason.

✅ Pros:

* Super intuitive site (even at 3 a.m. my sleep-deprived brain could order).
* Good communication with the writer.
* Paper quality was polished, with strong arguments and references.

❌ Cons:

* A bit pricier than EssayMarket. Think “Starbucks prices” vs. “gas station coffee.”

👉 If you want one of the top research paper writing services that feels smooth from start to finish: writepaperforme.

# 4.[ PaperCoach](https://essay.watch/n4DY1Z?type=8) – The Laid-Back Option

PaperCoach is like that chill friend who’ll help you study but might show up late. My experience was decent, though not flawless.

✅ Pros:

* Affordable packages.
* The writer had strong subject knowledge.
* Good for bigger projects if you’re not rushing.  

❌ Cons:

* Response times from support were slower.
* Needed a revision to fix some minor errors.  

👉 Not the absolute best research paper writing service, but a solid choice if you’ve got time: papercoachco.

Look, no service is magic. You still need to read over the paper, tweak it, and make sure it doesn’t scream “I outsourced this.” But if you’re juggling deadlines and need research paper help, these sites are honestly lifesavers.

At the end of the day, finding the best research paper writing service is like finding the least shady taco truck at 2 a.m.—you just want something safe, quick, and not going to ruin your semester. 

Whew. That’s my survival guide. What about you guys? Ever tried any of these research paper writing services? Did they save your GPA or just add more stress?

*Warning: this is a long post, so grab a coffee.*

I (30F) and my best friend (30M) have known each other since our teenage years, and he’s like a brother from another mother. All names are changed for privacy.

Four years ago, after some time doing long distance, Ben moved abroad to be with the love of his life – Sarah (37). I fully supported him. Sarah is smart, funny, and most importantly, she loves him the way he needs to be loved (which hadn’t happened in his previous relationships). She never had a problem with him having a female best friend, and I always kept a respectful distance so everyone felt comfortable.

During the first two years, our contact was online – me and Sarah bonded over shared interests, called each other regularly, and would drink and chat for hours. As time went on, our conversations became less frequent (life happens), but our bond stayed. We still sent each other gifts for birthdays, Christmas, etc. Honestly, I felt as close to Sarah as to Ben.

On the third year, they finally saved enough to come back to our home country for a short vacation – to see family, friends, and some medical specialists (since appointments where they live take months). I was thrilled. We agreed they’d spend 3–4 of their days with me and my boyfriend, so I had to take time off work. I work 12-hour shifts on my feet, so I wanted to be rested and fully present.

Everything was planned. I even took two extra days off to recover before they came, prepare my home, and make sure they’d feel comfortable.

May came, and they flew in. I couldn’t meet them at the airport because I was closing the shop, but I wished them a good stay with their families in another city. We confirmed we’d talk closer to their arrival at mine. Their whole stay was supposed to be 20 days, 4 of which with me. We agreed they’d confirm four days beforehand, and Ben did.

The first day of my vacation (their 14th day in the country), I cleaned, stocked up, and got ready. I was excited! Two days passed, so I reached out to check if anything had changed. Ben said everything was fine but he had a dentist appointment and they’d be a day late – arriving on the 18th. I said no problem (health first!) and that I’d wait for them to text/call when they left so I could welcome them.

The 18th came. I reached out again, irritated because my free time to see them was running out, and… nothing. They ghosted me.

My vacation ended without a word or apology. I went back to work disappointed and sad that I had wasted my days off, only to find out they’d extended their stay.

After four brutal 12-hour shifts, exhausted, I got a message from them apologizing for the delay and asking if we could meet the next day before they left. I apologized and said I couldn’t – I had plans with my parents and had already taken time off for them. Plus, I was dead tired. They offered to come see me even at my parents’ place. I explained it wasn’t possible and wouldn’t be fair to my parents. Ben said, “No problem, plans change, it’s fine,” and they left.

Two days later, I got a message from Sarah:

>

After that, our conversations dropped dramatically. I told Ben I was disappointed and hurt that he hadn’t reached out earlier to clarify the situation.

If he had messaged sooner, I might have been able to adjust my days off (later I found out the dentist appointment wasn’t last-minute; they had known about it and wouldn’t be able to come on time). If he had told me earlier they wouldn’t come, I could have spent those days with my family instead. I told him that even if I came across as selfish, my feelings in this situation are just as valid.

In the end, all parties were affected, and everyone’s feelings should be considered. But they continued insisting that I was the bitch.

I decided to keep minimal contact. Now I only text with Ben, and it’s dry, small-talk stuff. I’m planning to return the PlayStation games he lent me and cut off contact entirely, but my boyfriend thinks it’s not worth ending such a long friendship over this. But the friendship isn’t the same. The conversations feel like visiting someone bedridden in a hospital.

I ended up in the ER yesterday because of coffee-ground vomit (scary) and got taken back. Since I have an IV port and I’ve done fluids at home, they were able to do my labs through that port, which was the best. Hate being stuck with needles. They did an ultrasound (our first one!) and baby is measuring five days ahead and looks great… which I’m shocked by. I tracked my cycle very closely so I’m positive that my timing is spot on and know when we conceived, so baby is just a little big! At least one of us is thriving haha. After running my labs, they let me know that my potassium was dangerously low, at. 2.6 & they usually admit you, whether you like it or not at a 2.5. They weren’t actually worried about the bloody vomit because I have HG and sometimes that just happens. I got to take 4 potassium capsules (40 mg) and a magnesium (?mg) which by some miracle all stayed down. Thank you reglan. They also put me on an IV pump for potassium, which took 4 hours because they had to dilute it so much for me. If you’ve never had potassium via IV, it’s not fun & it literally hurts. After getting my potassium at the ER, they sent me home with an Rx for some tablets (take with food… lol as if. Told them I’m not eating & they said to try anyway & if my tummy handles it without food then it’s ok). I got home and I feel like a person again!!! The reglan + IV zofran has helped a TON with vomiting and I am seriously blown away by how much better I feel after all that potassium. All that to say, if you’re cramping in your legs after a 40 ft walk, your heart is thumping, and you feel half alive, maybe go to the ER or at least get your labs checked. You’re already dehydrated and underfed with HG so odds are your potassium might be low and they might be able to help you feel alive again. Hoping this helps someone!

1nimjqb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1nimjqb,Review: OutIn Portable Electric Vacuum Coffee Canister,"

Hey everyone! How are you?

Is anyone on the sub interested in vacuum canisters? The OutIn canister wasn't my first vacuum canister, but it was my first with truly useful technology.

It uses an automatic vacuum monitoring system.
It maintains vacuum pressure, and when the pressure decreases, the system automatically reactivates to ensure an oxygen-free environment.

I had given up on vacuum canisters a while ago, as all the ones I'd used weren't 100% effective or required manual monitoring (from time to time, I had to check the canister, open it, pump it, turn the lid, etc.). Since I like convenience, I had simply given up on that until I got this one. You simply put your coffee beans in it and go about your life, without having to check every couple of days to see if the canister is doing its job. This is my personal opinion, but I enjoy a healthy relationship with my hobby.  I want to enjoy everything related to coffee. We already have enough problems and worries in life.

It's all very simple: You put your beans in the container, put the lid on, press a button, and wait 12 seconds. That's it. Your beans are sealed.

The design is, in my opinion, very attractive, and the quality is excellent (stainless steel, rubber, and BPA-free plastic). The matte ABS exterior is beautiful and high-quality; because it's steel, you don't need to worry about extreme care when handling it (of course, you won't abuse it and drop it off your counter, but it can handle a lot. Unlike glass containers, for example—and yes, OutIn also has a glass version, but I prefer this one, due to the points raised in the text). Also, because it's steel, the beans are protected from sunlight.

The unboxing experience is great too.  It comes well protected inside the box with foam inserts and comes with a measuring spoon and cable (as well as a manual and cover letter).

According to OutIn, the battery lasts between three and six months. I've been using it for about two months and haven't needed to charge it yet.

Okay, but does it work? It works! It truly preserves the aroma and quality of the beans. I use it and the original package. I use the beans from the original package, in which the roaster sends the coffee, first, and then the beans from the OutIn canister. The result: Fresh, fragrant, and new (without that stale bean experience).

Is there anything I'd like to see improved? Yes! The capacity. Since I use 1kg of coffee per month, it would be a dream to have this exact canister, with a 1kg capacity.  That said, this canister is functional, looks nice on the countertop, preserves the beans, doesn't require physical effort like others, and doesn't cause problems (we've seen cases of other brands' canisters that, unfortunately, have caused quite a few problems recently).

I really wish OutIn would make this canister with a 1kg capacity. That would be my only reservation (it holds about 130/140g). My guess is that OutIn designed the canister with outdoor use in mind (130g of fresh beans is a great lifesaver during a short trip). Now I just have to hope they release a larger version.

Oh, I almost forgot: I read some reviews complaining about a bug in it, and... It's not a bug. If you have this canister or plan to buy it, when opening it to remove the beans, follow these steps:

Press the middle button (OutIn logo), remove the lid, and before placing the lid on the counter, press the Power button so it doesn't go off at the wrong time.  I'll leave a photo, with the step-by-step instructions, attached here.

I tried to keep the analysis quick and objective, but if you have any questions, leave a question and I'll be happy to answer.

PS: It's okay to disagree on a topic, as long as it's respectful and healthy. The last time I posted here, a user simply said that ""electric grinders were useless and shouldn't exist,"" among other things. So, free. I had written a text with great care, super detailed, and most people were super respectful and pleasant, with the exception of this person. It's okay to disagree, as long as we're polite, that way we maintain a healthy environment here on the sub.

1nimgic,https://www.reddit.com/r/mentalhealth/comments/1nimgic/do_i_have_something_or_am_i_just_normal/,do I have something or am I just normal,"hi. I take online quizzes often (just for fun) and I came across an “Are you Bipolar?” Test. i know these tests are usually really stupid and not something to take too seriously and obviously you can’t just go ahead and self-diagnose yourself but the questions they asked really resonated with how I’ve been feeling for the past 2-ish years. 

they asked  about major mood swings, feeling hyper and active at certain periods however also feeling irritable and annoyed. A really specific question on feeling elated yet sad at the same time came up and it talked about how your mood affects the quality of work… so on.   


these questions really clicked smth in me, like a feeling i’ve tried to describe and explain to others my whole life has final found an aswer. I always thought it was normal for people to feel this way, I guess it is but the level I feel it at just affects my whole day. Another statement asked, “I have times where I feel really optimistic about life and other times where I feel there is no hope.” Like that REALLY hit the nail on the head. This is exactly how I feel. And on a daily basis. My whole body shifts towards these feelings, I just I don’t know how to describe it to be honest. 

maybe I’m just going through it managing studies and life but genuienly there’s times where I feel so lost And completely hopeless. I think daily about if I  matter at all in the sea of billions of other people. Then some days I feel like I’m at the top of the world. I feel so ugly on some days. A model on others. And these feelings change VERY FAST. another example- I could be thinking that I’m healthy looking and that I have a great body today.  a couple hours later I’ll be crying about how ugly I am and how no one wants me.

these feelings aren’t only directed towards my looks, it revolves around everything I do. I always just make myself feel like I’m not good enough and that there’s no point of doing something if someone else is better than me at it.

so for example if I wanna pick up a new hobby or do something, start a business, make money some way, there’s day i’ll be SO ready and committed to doing it and then I just… lose hope completely. I’ll see someone already doing what I’m doing and just give up. and then I’ll watch a motivational video and get back up on my feet (only to give up again).

  
my actions depend HEAVILY on my mood, which I feel is normal but it affects it.. heavily.  to summarise I just have conflicting feelings towards EVERYTHING in life. I can never be totally optimistic towards a certain thing. which again I feel is normal but at the same time it doesn’t feel like it. I also feel a need to break everything I see for some reason and rip shit apart especially during mood swings and when I’m really frustrated.

im sorry if I’m not making sense, really, I just needed to get this agitating feeling off my chest. I also overthink every minor thing way too much, be it a text message, or a fking coffee order. anyway I’ve started journaling and it really does help get stuff off my very cluttered mind.

There’s so much more I wanna say but I really can’t piece the words together. I think I’ve  said most of it. is this normal behaviour?",2,1758040534.0,mentalhealth,2,1.0,False

I know James Hoffmann did a video regarding reheating coffee, but I don't remember him mentioning using (doing?) a sous vide, only using a steam wand to reheat the coffee, but that would add water to the finished product.

It would probably take a long time to reheat coffee with a sous vide, so it'd perhaps lead to oxidation or other problems. Perhaps a bain-marie or basically using boiling water would be a faster solution, but I'm just speculating.

Please let me know if someone has already tested this! I don't have the means to do a sous vide, but I'm really curious if anyone has tried this idea.",1,1758040454.0,pourover,7,1.0,False

I have anxiety and wanted to know specific things to ease it. Here are the answers to them.

Bracelet - you will have one. Black is for the elite club

Pools - there are 3 total. The large one is quieter, swim up bar is normal but small and the small “party” pool was at the very end.

Loungers - these fill up decently quick and staff does not take items off when people are not using them. We spent 8 hours at the party pool and there was a good handful of chairs that had stuff on them but I didn’t see people in them the entire 8 hours. 

Restaurants - when exiting the lobby towards the ocean, all restaurants/buffet will be to the right. There is 1 restaurant located inside behind the coffee area.  Honestly didn’t need to wait for any tables. I was never turned away like the front desk advised to get there early. The best place to eat was honestly the buffet. The restaurants were fine, just nothing outstanding. 

Bars - the American sports bar is at the very end of the building, opposite side of the buffet. This has stairs going up to it from the quiet large pool. This bar I really liked, had the football games on and obviously had American bar food. There are random bars throughout the resort. I used the bar outside the American bar at night. Gave you the best view of everything going on. I don’t speak much Spanish but if they don’t know the drink you want, they will blend a red/pink drink and call it good. Just a warning .

Events - their events are listed on their app when you select “I’m here”. I recommend asking staff where events are taking place because it’s so random and hard to find. There is a theater that they have performances that is next to the American bar. Go left coming out of the lobby.

Smoking areas - there are 3 smoking areas. In front of the resort, across from the lobby doors and not the outdoor couches. Theres one next to the quiet pool. If you’re walking up the stairs to the American bar, it’s to your right. It has tables and says staff only but that’s the smoking area. And finally the beach. They have cigarette trash cans to indicate where you can smoke.

Market - They have a variety of items. All pretty reasonably priced imo. Swimsuits ranged from $35 to - $50 USD. They have cigarettes and zyn. Cigs were $7 usd for a two pack and zyn was $13 for a 4 pack. If you want vapes, there are people selling them on the beach. Same with sunglasses. The market also has plan b which was $7 USD. 

Special cocktails - they will have a cart in the lobby starting at 5:30pm each night with a specialty cocktail. 

Rooms - shampoo, conditioner, body wash, lotion are all included. They worked just fine. 

Public bathrooms - there are a few located throughout the resort. The ones near the pool are on the beach. As soon as you go down the stairs from the quiet pool, take a right and its stairs going down. Another one is below the buffet near the spa and I believe there’s one near the elite club by the elevators.

Tipping - I spent $200 in tips for 4 days. I was happy to tip, but it looks like a lot of people don’t tip in general so don’t feel terrible if you don’t. I didn’t notice a difference in service. 

Please bring shoes with grip! The tile all throughout the resort is SLICK when wet. I watched so many people fall including myself

Random info - bring an insulated cup to keep your drinks cooler for longer. Your drinks will heat up very quickly. Bring straws if you like straws since they have none at resorts. Bring a small floaty for the pool as well as goggles if you’d like. Get pesos from your bank and not in Mexico. It didn’t cost me anything to exchange USD to pesos at my bank and you get to pick the bills. ",2,1758040366.0,AllInclusiveResorts,2,0.75,False

While the city waits for the next body to drop, the young journalist is preparing for a series of interviews with renowned portraiture Peter Ledgerwood. A journalist’s prowess is the only means Penelope has to support herself in this late Victorian London, depicting Ledgerwood’s tremendously outrageous escapades for all his adoring, coquettish fans. But Penelope suspects something is amiss when macabre gifts begin to drop on her doorstep, and soon Mr. Ledgerwood vanishes. The killer threatens both Penelope’s life and livelihood, and she must rely on both her wits and knowledge of the case in order to overcome this shadowy force that wants to add her and Ledgerwood’s names to his own dark grammarye.

 *In Perpetuam* is a gothic horror novel written in a Victorian style, complete at 78,000 words. This novel is the story of a girl’s attempts to reclaim the narrative of her life from the depression that haunts her and the artist who was determined to find the subject hidden in the background. Inspired by books like *Jane Eyre*, *Villette*, and *Dracula*, *In Perpetuam* is comparable to Cormac McCarthy’s *Stella Marris* that carries its audience on wandering journeys of prose into both the character’s mind and the world around. Marilynn Robinson’s works are also a large influence on my writing, and her novel *Jack* and its belief in the revitalizing power of love inspired similar themes in this work. In the end, *In Perpetuam* is a story about a girl who would rather give up the fight for her life, but day and day again struggles to live, and find meaning in the living and the story of her life. 

**First 300 words:**

The sun rises above London, and the smokestacks rise to meet her. The streets bustle; a clerk on his way to the law office, shoving amongst a crowd to arrive at the doors first; a priest in stately robes returning from a house call, to tend as a doctor would to a patient; a boy selling newspapers, crying out interesting lies and being all but mostly ignored except for the few who stopped to give a few coins and receive in exchange, stories. There were thousands more on that street that morning, each with their coming from’s and to’s, different manners of dress, and thoughts and acts. While words are costless things, ink and print have a price. Time and memory are expensive materials to acquire. So, we must be scrupulous in method and dogged in our attempts.

Steam curled above a coffee cup, a miniature version of the tamed tails that marked the skyline. The length of smokey air reached higher and higher, unexpectedly broken when the boy who had ordered it reached for the cup and took a sip, wincing at the heat of the drink. He was young, only fifteen, but his quick wit and well-read family helped him when securing a job at the *Gazette*. Still, he hadn’t learned yet to sip on hot drinks, to wait patiently as it cooled and to blow lightly across the seam of the porcelain cup.

People passed through the doorway, some in pairs, some alone, some laughing, some silent. They found seats, abandoned them. The world turned as a carousel does, continually winding around and around as we waited for the interruption which we sought.

Out in the street, a figure distinguished itself from the crowd, walking across the street, smoothly stepping between carriages, and earning the proper chiding response from those who passed him by. He stepped onto the sidewalk to read over the name of the café, nodded to himself once, and entered.",2,1758040239.0,PubTips,3,1.0,False

1nim7kr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Muskegon/comments/1nim7kr/our_trip_to_muskegon/,Our trip to Muskegon,"My family and I recently returned from a two week trip to Muskegon.  It was our first trip to Michigan.  Thought I would share some thoughts in case others were considering vacationing in the area.  

General overview.  Western Michigan is gorgeous and Muskegon is a lovely city that is centrally located to the best the area has to offer. It's a walkable city with a ""small town feel"" while being large enough to have an assortment of nice museums and even a professional hockey team.  The town is very cycling  friendly with an abundance of bike lanes and paths  The views of Lake Musekgon are beautiful and Pere Marquette Beach must be among the nicest beaches in America.  You would need to be on the west coast to see a sunset over endless water that even remotely compares to a Pere Marquette sunset.  I would encourage anyone visiting western MI to consider staying in Muskegon.  

Food.  We were able to try so many options during our stay so I'll hit the highlights.  Our favorite was definitely The Deck.  Great BBQ, fast service, and a beautiful view of the water and sunset.  The Deck is such a nice place and in our experience nothing in Holland or Grand Haven came close.  I have to mention Slappy's hot dogs as being dang good hot dogs.  For some reasono we take hot dogs seriously in WV and Slappy's was very, verey good.  The food at Muskegon Brewing Company was also good but the views of Lake Muskegon were better. This is a nice place to have a beer and enjoy an evening.   The sourdough doughnuts at Dockside Doughnuts are worth every calorie. My goodness they are good and their latte was pretty good too. 

Carlisle food was okay, overepriced, but it was fun to watch the hockey team practice.  Socibowl is a very fun restaurant and our 2 year old had fun on their bowling lanes during a sleepy mid-week evening.  Socibowl was a ton of fun.  

Coffee.  I always lose some of my redneck credibility when I say this but I love a good cortado. Bonus points if you can make an iced cortado but most folks can't do it and I'm not sure why.  BUT that is not true in good ole Muskegon.  Enter Holly at The Gooleyguk Cafe.  A funny name for a serious coffee enterprise.  Turns out Holly is also a huge fan of iced cortados and it is excellent, the best I have had outside my own kitchen.  It's not on the menu but do yourself a favor and ask for a cortado iced with a little brown sugar and a little maple syrup.  Odds are, if you just ask Holly for a cortado ""like the guy from West Virginia"" she will remember it.  Every city with small town vibes needs a great cafe.  Gooleyguk is all that and then some.  

Recreation/things to do.  It goes without saying that there is an endless supply of beaches and water in this area.  Like photography? Don't leave home without your camera and certainly don't miss a Lake Michigan sunset.  Want to hike?  We drove to Sleeping Bear Dunes and hiked the entirety of the dunes, even with two kids aged 2 and 5 months.  We carried the kiddos like pack mules but it was doable and a good workout.  The views at SBD are other worldly.  Pere Marquette is so nice I am listing it twice.  Go there and you'll see.  Muskegon's location is nice as it is close to A LOT.  We did the touristy stop at the village in Holland which was fine.  

We also went to the John Ball Zoo in Grand Rapids which was very nice, just all on the side of what felt like the only hill in Michigan.  But it was nice.  We also went to the Boulder Ridge Wild Animal Park which was also very nice.  I have never been to a zoo with an abundance of very large enclosures for the animals to roam.  

The children's museum was great and our 2 year old loved it.  Highly recommend and it was FREE! We have nothing like this anywhere near where we live.  

Children.  I already mentioned the zoos, museum, and beaches which all kids would enjoy.  But I mention this separately for anyone with children visiting Muskegon which we really enjoyed.  There are seemingly countless play areas for children in and around the city.  I have never been anywhere with more playgrounds in my life.  They were clearly designed for different age groups and abilities.  Someone in Muskegon deserves a high five for securing grant money, donations, etc. for making this town very friendly for children.  We just dont see that level of commitment where we are from in WV.  

EDITED to add anyone with dogs should go to the Kruse Dog Beach!  Our dogs loved running off leash and the beach was excellent. Parking is abundant and a short jaunt down the steps and you’re there. Great way to spend an evening.",45,1758039970.0,Muskegon,7,0.94,False

So I have a massive phobia of dentists and needles and haven't been to one since 2018 but as a result I take good care of my teeth, brushing 2-3x daily with an electric toothbrush, flossing daily (since about 2022), using a water flosser when I remember, and I use 0% alcohol mouthwash after eating anything sugary or acidic and I'm basically just always extremely anxious and paranoid about my teeth.

​I believe my top back left molar chipped without me realising and now has a sharp edge, this has exposed an area of the tooth to me that I couldn't previously see... it's grey/black there so not really any pain at all in the tooth with pressure, heat/ cold, or sweet things and the grey/black area is not soft I prodded it with a tooth pick and scraped it with my nail and nothing comes off and it feels hard not spongy and again no pain. I also don't have bad breath or at least have not been told I do and I do have people I would truth to have told me that.
​The thing is I had silver fillings put in when I was 15 but I was under general anaesthetic due to the extreme phobia of needles and it was over a decade ago and I can't remember if I had one in this tooth or not as far as I remember I only had them in my bottom teeth but I might have just forgot since I haven't been able to see that tooths surface before now...

​I know there are 2 smaller black/brown spots visable also but i have these on many teeth and did have when I used to go to the dentist and they said they were okay and just staining due to me drinking lots of coffee so I'm hoping it's the same on this tooth and those are just stains.

​I know its an awful picture but it's the best I could take I've taken many and it's the most clear out of all of them, based on the info provided do you think it's likely tooth decay or do you think im an idiot whos forgot they have a filling in that tooth? Should I be concerned?

1nim570,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1nim570/prayers/,Prayers,"Since there is no way of her seeing this, I wanted to tell you about a girl I know from church named Shawn (from the northeast twin cities area). Been friends with her for at least 20 years. She’s incredibly down to earth, the kind of person who never seeks attention but is always quietly doing things for others. She helps so many people behind the scenes and refuses to take any credit, often doing things anonymously,  I know I’ve helped on a couple missions and have been sworn to secrecy.  

 

She's been married and divorced, and had a couple other relationships, and I believe she might be in one now. To the story: she prays for the wellbeing one guy Rick since the day I met her. When I first met her 20 years ago, she was young and just had a miscarriage, looking for guidance. She walked away from the relationship with Rick because she was scared, wasn’t married and didn’t think he even cared since he did what he wanted to do. Quite frankly young and a mess. From what I was told by her it was love at first sight with Rick, in a school cafeteria. Since the day I met her, she prays the same thing for him every prayer. She prays that God would give any forgiveness he has given to her, to be given to Rick if he never asks, and that he is surrounded by angels to always watch over him. Reminds me of what Jesus said, ""greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends."" Although that’s not how forgiveness works, I think she would plead her case in heaven if given the chance. There is a love there that words cannot describe. Sharing this story because wherever this guy is, I think he should know. And I secretly pray for them to be reunited; she always wanted another chance with him, although Shawn wrote it off years ago. Miracles can happen, right? All I know about Rick is he hand whittled a chain links for Shawn.  It’s our turn to help for everything Shawn does for others and pray for them, she deserves so much happiness. Hopefully, the internet does its thing and somehow, he sees this so that he knows. And when he does, I want him to know she’s not a weirdy, this is not out of habit she cares and has genuine love for you, with a realistic expectation of receiving nothing in return. He can reach out to me, and I will sit with him for coffee and discuss if he so desires.",1,1758039823.0,Christianity,0,1.0,False

That settled within couple of hours. I slept well through the night. I woke up feeling very full. I had a few sips of my coffee and I felt full. I have mild sulfur burps and I ate 4 spoons of my parfait and I feel the same way. I am looking for advice on how to eat through the day? What kind of foods help provide adequate nutrition and avoid causing sulfur burps/ reflux? I also feel like I have dry mouth.

Any advice would be highly appreciated!

  Kota Lee brushed strands of my dirty blond hair away from my forehead and then pressed the back of his palm against it. “You feel warm still.” He sat next to me on his bed, wearing green and white plaid flannel pajama pants and a green T-shirt. He studied my face.  
  
  Dr. Green stood in front of us, eyeballing me and waiting for the thermometer in my mouth to finish reading my temperature. His arms were folded over his chest, making creases in the untucked, unbuttoned yellow shirt, and the white T-shirt underneath. He wore jeans, too, so I guessed he wasn’t going to work at the hospital today. “Let’s let the gadget thingie tell us if she has a fever.”  
  
  “The thermometer?” Kota asked.  
  
  Dr. Green dropped his hands, stuffed them into his pockets and shrugged. “I get so many gadget thingies. That’s what they all are.”  
  
  I smiled with the thermometer in my mouth. Strands of my hair fell over my cheeks, and while I tried to brush it back, Kota knocked my hands away from my face and gave me the eye to tell me not to move so they could get an accurate reading. I breathed out through my nose and waited, the loose hair tickling my forehead and cheeks. My hair was a mess after sleeping over; I must have thrashed around a lot in my sleep.  
  
  After about a week of being sick, the other guys had slowly started to get back to normal, returning home. I’d stayed at Kota’s house, at first because I was sick, and later because I was helping the others to recover. There were times when I’d run over to Nathan’s house to take care of things while he was sick. I’d also or occasionally gone to the diner to help while Luke and North were recovering.  
  
  My home base had shifted to Kota’s house because that was where everyone else usually ended up. Kota’s mother checked on us on occasion, too.  
  
  Apparently everyone taking over Kota’s upstairs bedroom while being sick was normal for them, and she didn’t say a word about me joining the guys.  
  
  We had all just starting to feel right again when my temperature had jumped in an odd spike last night. I was feeling a little run-down but had assumed I was only tired. Kota checked my forehead, said I must have overworked myself into being sick again and sent me to bed early.  
  
  Dr. Green hovered over us with a soft smile and a few curls of his dirty blond hair hanging around his forehead as he waited. He and Kota had such worried, concerned shadows behind their happy demeanors.  
  
  I was going to say I was fine, but kept my mouth closed, hoping the thermometer would tell them for me.  
  
  When it beeped, he pulled it out and looked at the digital screen. “According to this, she’s dead.”  
  
  I giggled, sure he either was reading it upside down or just making a joke. “I’m fine,” I said, probably for the hundredth time that week. “I feel normal.”  
  
  Dr. Green held his smile but looked at the thermometer again. He pushed the button once, to turn it off, and then again to turn it on. “One more time, though. Seriously. I think you opened your mouth.”  
  
  I hadn’t but was willing to sit through it again just to prove I wasn’t sick...or dead.  
  
  Dr. Green put the thing under my tongue and then looked at Kota. “It’s not like we should be in a hurry. Right now, your schedules are all changed. You’ll go to homeroom and then to Music Room B while we figure out our next steps.”  
  
  “Sang, too?” Kota asked.  
  
  Dr. Green nodded. “She’s already pinned as one of us by most of the staff and her schedule is out of whack. Despite our efforts, she has been missing a lot of school. She might be getting straight A grades, but we weren’t able to totally mark her as in attendance as we thought we could. We might get away with it with a fake Academy record that she’s been at the other school on days off. Might as well officially enroll her with us full time so we can have control of her schedule.” His green eyes sparked with amusement. “Did you hear that? You’re stuck with us now.”  
  
  I grinned, although it was more like barring teeth to keep the thermometer in and then closed my mouth quickly.  
  
  “What about Mr. Hendricks?” Kota asked, seeming to read my mind. “What happens when he wants something from her and tries to call her parents?”  
  
  “We’re going to face it sooner or later,” Dr. Green said. “What happens if we find this missing money? Hendricks will point fingers, including at her. The people he keeps close are ones with a lot of skeletons they want to keep in the closet. She’s not a threat to involve any police, but he could change that in a few seconds with a phone call. Based on who he is and his status, he could make things escalate very quickly and he’s not above lying. If we kick his beehive enough, he might do it.”  
  
  “We can stop it, though,” Kota said.  
  
  “We may need to get her off the radar before that happens.” He looked over to the window, to the street outside. “We’re taking a lot of risks trying to keep things as they were. The best thing to do right now is to get her away from the potential for harm when it all falls down. We were kidding ourselves. Extracting her from the school was never going to be easy, and we’ve made it ten times harder involving her as much as we have.”  
  
  K  
ota caught my attention with a stare and then winked at me. It wasn’t the first time I suspected things might change after this year when I’d possibly join with the Academy, but Dr. Green made it sound like they’d been planning for a while to get me out of Ashley Waters High School.  
  
  Dr. Green continued going over how we’d handle the next few weeks. Since we’d gotten sick, Academy meetings had been held in person, usually at Kota’s house. With Volto getting closer and more dangerous and clearly listening in on any phone calls, despite Victor’s efforts to evade him, no one was taking any risks. Phone calls were only for every day normal things—no Academy business.  
  
  I hadn’t turned on my new phone all week. Since mine had been compromised, Victor had provided a new one that had a unique heart sticker on the inside of the cover so I’d know if it’d been switched. Once we returned to school and the diner I’d have to carry it with me, but I planned only to use it for emergencies. I was paranoid now and waited until people were around to talk to them about anything, including simple, friendly things.  
  
  When Dr. Green took the thermometer from me again, he shook his head and pouted. “Yup. Dead. Is this one broken?”  
  
  “What does it say?” Kota asked.  
  
  “Ninety-five point eight,” he said. “I thought you said she had a fever last night. This is the opposite of a fever, Kota. You should get her a heating blanket.”  
  
  “Ninety-six is my normal,” I said. Had this not come up before? Maybe not, since I hadn’t really been sick around them before. “If my temperature is ninety-eight, I’m uncomfortable and if it’s ninety-nine, I’m feeling really sick.”  
  
  Dr. Green smirked and put the thermometer away. “You just break all the rules, don’t you? I wouldn’t mind taking a few blood tests to be sure it isn’t anything serious. It could be your normal or it could be something else.”  
  
  “Could it be serious?” Kota asked.  
  
  “Well, she doesn’t have a whole lot of other symptoms,” Dr. Green said. He raised a quizzical eyebrow and looked at me. “No internal pain?”  
  
  I shook my head.  
  
  “We don’t have to hurry with it,” Dr. Green said. “But I’ll put you on my schedule.”  
  
  Kota sighed and shook his head. He stood up and adjusted his shirt and pants from the mess they were in since we’d both just woken up. “Well, as long as she’s not very sick...or actually dead.”  
  
  He headed toward the closet, pulling out clothes for himself. His brown hair was sticking out in the back in a way I liked; I’d come to enjoy his fresh-out-of-bed look. He was a lot like Mr. Blackbourne during the day, with hair just right and glasses polished. In the mornings, though, he was almost human, casual, and occasionally without his glasses. I found his face handsome, and admired it.  
  
  Dr. Green waited until Kota was in the bathroom, and then reached for my forehead, pressing his palm to my skin. He held there and then eased back to brush some of my hair away from my eyes. “Almost ready to get back into the saddle, pumpkin?” he asked.  
  
  I tried to smile, but I was shaking my head at the same time. Could I ever be prepared to go back to school now? Every time I showed up, something strange or awful happened. I wasn’t even worried about the other students anymore. The teachers and staff were unpredictable enough.  
  
  “Well, you don’t have to go back right now,” he said.  
  
  The door to the bathroom opened and Kota stepped out, dressed and ready for the day in jeans and a thin, green sweater. He had cleaned his glasses with a microfiber cloth and his brown hair was brushed neatly aside on his forehead. “So today’s the day, huh?” he asked.  
  
  “I figured with the two of you, we can get through them all in one day,” Dr. Green said. “Unless we’re missing any items. Hard to keep track. There’s a mountain.”  
  
  “Today’s the day we find out if we’re missing anyone,” Kota said. “A couple weeks out should be enough time to get more. And if that’s the case, we’ll just order things from the internet to be delivered. We’ve got time.”  
  
  I looked from Kota to Dr. Green and back. “Huh?” I asked.  
  
  “Wrapping Day,” Dr. Green said. “I’ve got all the gifts at my house for Christmas this year. Now that everyone else is busy, you and Kota are going to help me sort and wrap them all up. You just don’t get to see your own, and you two have to wrap mine so I can pretend I don’t know what they are.” He finished with a satisfied grin.  
  
  I started to get up but froze as I thought about gifts. I’d started my shopping with Luke and Gabriel. Gabriel had tucked those items away, promising to send them on to Dr. Green to wrap. I hadn’t thought about it since.  
  
  I hadn’t finished shopping for everyone. And Gabriel had the rest of the cash I’d brought to buy them with.  
  
  Dr. Green stepped away from the bed to talk to Kota. “We’ll have to be careful, though. Volto doesn’t seem to like me being around her. I don’t want to kowtow to his demands, but we’re in a dangerous position as it is.”  
  
  “Luke was onto him,” Kota said, putting his hands on his hips. He wore a determined look with a tight smile. “We were close enough that he took some drastic steps to stop us. Which means we need to know what Luke knows.”  
  
  “We debriefed him,” Dr. Green said. “And we’ve got a list we’re working from.” He eyeballed me. “Is that what you’re wearing?” he asked as his smile lifted. “I think it’s adorable. You should just come in your pajamas.”  
  
  Heat burned through my face. It was tempting to simply hop into a car wearing what I had on, but going to Dr. Green’s condo might mean running into Mr. Blackbourne, and then I’d feel foolish and wish I’d changed. I stood up and found my phone on the side table. “I’ll get dressed,” I said.  
  
  The guys went downstairs, leaving me to pick out a few things Kota had in his closet for me. There was a pair of nice slacks that Gabriel had bought on impulse last time he was out shopping. I put on a casual pink blouse, too, and a light windbreaker—it had gotten cold now that it was December.  
  
  I avoided the shower in the bathroom, and simply did a quick wash of my face in the sink. I’d take a bath that night before going to school.  
  
  I typed out a quick text to Gabriel, and even then I hesitated, knowing Volto was probably reading it. Still, it was a normal thing and not Academy related, so it probably didn’t matter.  
  
  Sang: I never finished shopping for gifts for the other guys. Do we need to go again?  
  
  By the time I’d brushed my hair, the phone was vibrating on the counter, making a funny echo in the bathroom. Instead of returning my text, Gabriel was calling.  
  
  “We got a few extra things for you,” Gabriel said when I answered. “I went back out two days ago and had to figure out all that shit by myself.”  
  
  “Why didn’t you tell me?” I asked.  
  
  “You were at the damn diner again. And Luke was cleaning up after Sprinkles the skunk snuck into North’s room and made a doodie in his laundry basket.”  
  
  I giggled at the news. I hadn’t heard that story yet but hoped Luke wouldn’t let Sprinkles get into too much trouble with North. It had been hard enough to get North to agree to let Luke keep the pet skunk.  
  
  “Don’t worry,” he said. “You’ll see them if you’re going over there today anyway. I got for everyone but Mr. Blackbourne. I never know what to get him. Just ask Dr. Green. He can usually come up with an idea.”  
  
  “Thanks, Gabriel.”  
  
  “Trouble, you owe me a week without your clip in your goddamn hair now. You’ve got money left over though from that night. I took care of the rest of it.”  
  
  “You didn’t need to do that.”  
  
  “It’s fine. I keep forgetting to bring the cash back, though. It’s sitting on my dresser. I need to move it at least so what’s-his-fuck, Pam’s boyfriend, doesn’t take it. Oh, and I bought another game for our 3DSs, too with the money I had left over. That’s our gift to us.”  
  
  “Thanks for taking care of it. Take some money since it was me getting gifts for you all, technically.” I didn’t know we were to buy  
gifts for ourselves, but I assumed he meant my gift to them was a game and he got me the game, too. The surprise was spoiled now but I didn’t mind. I was getting excited to see what else ‘I’ got for the others.  
  
  It also had me excited to think of what else the guys got for me. Not in a greedy way, but all of the things Gabriel, Luke and I had picked out, we could all enjoy together. Nerf swords and toys and games: Fun things.  
  
  INSIDE THE HEART OF A DOCTOR  
  
  Once I got off the phone with Gabriel, Kota, Dr. Green and I got into Dr. Green’s car.  
  
  I sat in the front passenger seat beside Dr. Green and Kota was in the back.  
  
  I’d had a coffee and a quick Pop Tart on my way out the door; Dr. Green had promised a proper lunch at his house later on.  
  
  “I want to make sure we get a good head start on it all,” he said with a chuckle. He glanced at me using the rearview mirror. “This will be a lot of fun since we’ve got you this year.” He turned the car onto the highway and headed into Charleston.  
  
  He and Kota talked about if they had enough wrapping paper. I was half listening, but mostly I stared out the window at the blue sky, feeling the slight chill of winter, wondering about how different living in the south was going to be; there wasn’t going to be any snow.  
  
  Anything to take my mind off of returning to school soon.  
  
  I must have been dazed out because the ride seemed to happen in a split second. We were suddenly pulling into the drive that led to his condo. His was the last in a line of five and there were cars parked in the other drives. I wondered about his neighbors though I didn’t see any at the moment.  
  
  Dr. Green’s was the most lavishly landscaped; roses growing from most of the available garden space, compared to the simple green bushes everyone else kept.  
  
  Dr. Green parked in his drive and turned to me. “Ready?”  
  I blinked rapidly to focus and then nodded. I hoped there were simple boxes I could stick with. The few gifts I’d wrapped had been for Marie, at the request of our father for birthdays and Christmas. It was something I didn’t exactly excel at. Marie was actually better.  
  
  I joined Dr. Green and Kota on the porch, waiting to go in, when Kota asked, “Did you put her gifts away?”  
  
  “Yeah, they’re in my bedroom,” Dr. Green said and pushed the door open.  
  
  “All of them?” Kota asked. “I dropped a few off yesterday morning.”  
  
  I’d started inside, but Dr. Green reached out and gripped my elbow, holding me just inside the short foyer before I could go deeper into the condo. “Uh...” Dr. Green said. “Hang on there, pookie. Let Kota double check... and also, Kota, check the kitchen and the spare bedroom. Make sure I didn’t leave anything out that’s meant for her. We’ll spread out in the living room to wrap. Toss anything of hers into my bedroom.”  
  
  Exactly how many gifts were there, that Dr. Green had them spread out all over? I grinned as Kota walked around me to get into the living room just beyond the foyer. “Keep her there,” he said. “Give me a minute.”  
  
  It was tempting to misbehave a little and peek around the corner, but I forced myself to stay still with Dr. Green near the door. I didn’t want to know. I would forever second-guess the gifts I’d gotten for them, and had to trust that Gabriel got things that would be appropriate. I couldn’t even imagine what they could be. Most likely toy swords and gumball machines.  
  
  I also considered something else: Did I want to try to get small individual gifts just from me? It was nice that Gabriel had gotten gifts for them, but I wanted to get them each something special. Something none of them knew about.  
  
  Only I didn’t have the money. Gabriel had used the last of what I’d had from the diner. The few hours I’d worked this week at the diner were mostly to cover the counter, and the counter had been really slow the times I’d been there.  
  
  The rustling sounds of Kota fumbling through boxes drifted to us as we waited in the foyer. I was still thinking of gifts and what I could do to surprise them when Dr. Green put his palms on the wall on either side of my shoulders, trapping me. I looked up at him and saw his playful smile.  
  
  “Hi Pookie,” he whispered.  
  
  Thoughts of gifts slipped away, replaced by excitement, and then panic. I braced against the wall, hoping Kota didn’t come back around the corner to spot us like this.  
  
  Dr. Green dipped his head to land a gentle kiss on my forehead. “I’m glad you’re feeling better.”  
  
  “I... missed you, too,” I said quietly.  
  
  The smile on his face lit up his green eyes in a way that made him much handsomer than before. In the casual clothes, he looked younger, leaning toward my age of sixteen instead of nineteen. A curl of sandy blond hair fell over his eye as he looked at me eagerly. “May I sneak a kiss?”  
  
  I nodded. I wanted to, but also was mindful of Kota.  
  
  His lips pressed to mine. I puckered my lips, not going too far, just a peck.  
  
  He held his lips against mine for longer than I expected, but then backed up and his smile seemed even brighter than before. “I can’t wait until it’s not a secret anymore,” he whispered.  
  
  “I hadn’t thought of what it might be like,” I said. I’d been so focused, waiting for the others to tell Kota about the plan, not thinking about what would happen after. I worried about how he might feel, and how best to talk openly with the others about the idea without fighting. It was all so complicated.  
  
  “Won’t it be wonderful?” he whispered and then moved to brace his shoulder against the wall, tucking me in front of him. He had his back to the hallway opening, so if Kota came around the corner, it would look like he was preventing me from viewing what was around the bend. “I could kiss you openly. I could hold your hand. We could go out on dates together and let them all know. Without worrying about what anyone thinks. It won’t matter how many pictures Volto takes. Won’t that be great?”  
  
  Would I ever get to the point where I wasn’t worried about what someone else would think about anything? Lily and her team hid away from the world to avoid what other people thought of them. Besides that, there was our own group to worry about, too. North and Luke got jealous at times, even though they were both for the plan. Would there always be the threat of jealousy? Or could we actually get beyond that?  
  
  Still, Dr. Green seemed so eager. How strange that it was such a normal thing—to kiss a boy, or go out on a date—things he wanted to do, but was prevented because of what it looked like from the outside.  
  
  How our lives had shifted. I’d once been the lonely girl in my bedroom, dreaming of normal life. Now here I was, out in the world, and still there were limitations, for them as well. The plan they’d presented, that I secretly desired, and yet was still hesitant to admit to, all centered on me. If we followed through, even if they were all in on it, we would still not be normal.  
  
  Maybe if I hadn’t met them, and had continued on how I was, had grown to eighteen in my house, maybe I would have been normal. Eventually. Or would I have ever been? Would I always feel like I was on the outside, like I had for most of my life?  
  
  Kota whistled and then called out, “Okay, I think I grabbed everything.”  
  
  Dr. Green took my hand and led me around the corner. At least no one ever seemed to mind my holding hands with them. Kota didn’t say anything about it as we turned the bend.  
  
  I’d seen Dr. Green’s home once before. Back then it was impeccably clean, with his DVDs organized, everything in its place, and his glass-topped coffee table spotless.  
  
  This time, while the space was clean, it was cluttered with boxes and shopping bags along the couch, the floor, and the coffee table.  
  
  “There’s a few more in the kitchen,” Kota said. “And in the spare room. But the only things that are in the master bedroom are Sang’s and ours.”  
  
  “Why’d you hide mine?” Dr. Green asked. “We’re going to wrap them.”  
  
  “Just to get them out of the way,” Kota said. “Sang can wrap mine, you can wrap Sang’s, and I’ll wrap yours when we get to them. That way we can tell the others we didn’t wrap our own gifts.”  
  
  “I might not have everything for everyone,” I said. “Gabriel mentioned he couldn’t think of anything to get Mr. Blackbourne. I don’t have anything for him.”  
  
  Kota and Dr. Green shared a look. “Did you get him anything?” Kota asked him.  
  
  “Not yet,” Dr. Green said, scratching absently at his temple. “The man has everything, doesn’t he?”  
  
  “And doesn’t want much of anything,” Kota said. “He’s as minimalist as they get sometimes.”  
  
  Dr. Green pressed his lips together and surveyed the mountain of boxes and bags scattered around his living room. “Well, let’s get through this and then we’ll figure out that part.” He winked at Kota and then put a hand on top of my head, messing up my hair.  
  
  I smiled, but then my hair loosened and the clip fell out. Dr. Green swooped to pick it up for me, but when I went to put it back, my hair was tangled.  
  
  “We can start sorting,” Kota said, going to the couch and opening up a white department store bag. He checked the contents and then pulled out folded sets of clothing. “I’m going to need boxes.”  
  
  “Sang,” Dr. Green said, going to the coffee table and sliding boxes around, adding some to a pile on the floor. “In the spare bedroom, there’s a large green tote box. All the gift boxes are inside. Go grab it? And no sneaking a peek in my bedroom.”  
  
  I nodded and went to the hallway. The furthest door to the right was the main bedroom, which I’d been in before. That door was closed. All the doors were closed except one.  
  
  The smells of the condo were filling my nose, Jasmine, citrus, ginger and cedar. There were other scents, too, like cleaners and carpet and other indescribable house smells. This was Dr. Green’s home. No parents. No one to hide from. I liked being here. It was one of the few places where I simply felt safe  
. Some of the boys had nice homes, but it often felt like someone could walk in, like a parent, and not all of them were nice.  
  
  I went to the open door, assuming that had to be the spare room but found a bathroom instead. I stood inside it for a moment combing out my tangled hair with my fingers. I looked for a brush on the counter to borrow, couldn’t find one, and settled for twisting my hair and clipping it as neatly as I could.  
  
  When I came back out of the bathroom into the hallway, the house was quiet.  
  
  I listened, hoping to hear Dr. Green and Kota. The place was so still. I couldn’t even imagine they were still inside. Had they left? Or had they gone into the kitchen and I couldn’t hear them?  
  
  There were two more doors down the hall, one near the bathroom, and one at the very end, opposite the main bedroom. I still wasn’t sure which one was the spare bedroom, and what the other room would be. Then I remembered him, or someone, had said there was an office.  
  
  I padded my way down the hall until I came to the next door down the hallway. I pushed my ear to the wood, listening for any sign of Dr. Green or Kota, just in case they had slipped in while I was in the bathroom. When I didn’t hear anything, I opened the door and peeked inside.  
  
  It was dark but light enough that I could see that it looked to be an office, with a desk and bookshelves. The room was on the small side, smaller than my bedroom back home, or even Gabriel’s tiny bedroom in his trailer.  
  
  Out of the corner of my eye, I caught a winged shadow flutter overhead.  
  
  My heart leaped into my throat and I froze.  
  
  Another shadow to the left shifted, flying toward me.  
  
  I took a step back and started to shut the door in a hurry, thinking there was a flying bug in the room and I was going to let it out. The door stopped against my shoe before shutting completely.  
  
  A flurry of activity within the room caused me to cringe, and then pause to listen. The sound was like the rustle of paper blowing in the wind, but it was coming from above my head. It wasn’t just a bug. It had to be dozens of them inside. Was the window open?  
  
  I closed the door until there was a crack left so I could peek in. The sound died quickly, and I waited. I knew I should find out what was inside, and then go back and tell Dr. Green right away if there were bugs in his office. He’d want to know. However, I wouldn’t want him to go charging in if the bugs were wasps and not beetles or something else.  
  
  I opened the door slowly, peering into the darkness. My heart flew into a frenzy when it looked like there were birds and butterflies flying overhead.  
  
  I jerked back in surprise until I realized they were motionless, only moving with the smallest bit of breeze that I had created by opening the door.  
  
  I breathed in slowly, smelling ginger and cedar, and…construction paper? There was a hint of glue as well, along with the unmistakable chemical tang from markers.  
  
  I found a light switch along the wall and flicked it on.  
  
  There were actual birds and butterflies floating above my head. They were so perfect, almost lifelike. My brain wanted to insist that they were real and hovering over me; I kept ducking, assuming one would finally flutter down toward me.  
  
  I eased in further, curious. There were more butterflies and birds hanging down the deeper I went in, but also fish and bugs. They were suspended by fishing wire, barely noticeable until I caught the light above reflecting across the string.  
  
  The animals all looked so real, swimming and flying above me. Vivid blues, reds, and greens: all sorts of colors mixed in together. The birds looked so soft and the fish appeared to wriggle with life at the most subtle of air movements.  
  
  I stepped closer, looking up at the display, until I bumped into the desk, forcing me to look down and check out the layout of the rest of the room.  
  
  I froze, finding myself in the middle of an entire display of delicate paper animals.  
  
  I’d found the door to Narnia.  
  
  Nearly every inch of space was covered in paper craftwork. Animals hung from above. Shelves held pedestals, and on top were homes and entire neighborhoods, both Japanese and American in style. Some looked familiar, and one looked so similar to Bob’s Diner, and another like the hospital he worked at. Some of the buildings were so small, they were the size of a small cell phone. Some were so detailed that they had tiny blades of grass around the edges and numbers above doors and on mailboxes. There were flowers in vases on his desk, and picture boxes along the walls depicting scenes of the ocean, of people sitting to eat at a meal.  
  
  I tiptoed further in, drawn to every surface, my eyes wide as I tried to take in everything. My breath caught at the sheer number of tiny items around, the paper animals above my head, the wall full of paper-crafted flowers and trees. While there were some origami pieces, many were cut paper, pieced together.  
  
  A gentle cough came from the doorway.  
  
  I spun, my palm planted hard against my chest to stop my wild heart, amazed at what I'd just seen, and terrified at being caught snooping.  
  
  ""I was wondering what was taking you so long,"" Dr. Green said.  
  
  “I … I was looking for...,” I said.  
  
  “I figured you got lost,” he said with a teasing grin spread across his face. His eyes went to the walls and ceiling. “Not bad for a bit of paper and glue, huh?”  
  
  My eyes widened in surprise. “Did you make it all?”  
  
  “Paper craft is pretty popular in Japan,” he said. “Picked it up a while back. It’s one of those things I can do that doesn’t involve thinking too hard. Just creating.”  
  
  ""It's…it's…."" I didn't have a word. What he created was nothing short of magic. The doctor who could heal also had a talent for practically giving life to paper.  
  
  He curled his fingers at me, urging me to stand in front of his desk. ""Come on. I'll show you,"" he said quietly.  
  
  ""Show me what?""  
  
  He wriggled his eyebrows. ""How I'm going to win your little heart.""  
  
  I couldn’t hide my smile. Did he not know he was already winning it? He was very flirty, but I was still too in awe to say anything.  
  
  I stood, nearly holding my breath, as he pulled out a couple of sheets of paper in shades of green and red, a ruler, and a slim paper knife from a desk drawer. As he bent over the paper, I noticed his desk was padded, so he could cut at ease without hurting it.  
  
  Dr. Green focused on the paper, bending and folding. He worked so quickly, it was like when Victor’s fingers swept across the piano, or when Nathan lunged with a kick. It was the same precision and artistry that had to come from practice. Bending here. Cutting there. First one piece of paper, and then another.  
  
  Before I could ask him what he was making, he covered the papers with his hands. I got that he wanted it to be a surprise so I then looked at some of the creations that had only been partially completed.  
  
  He reached into the desk again, drawing out a pen. He marked on his hidden creation, in what looked like dot marks. It wasn’t writing, at least, it didn’t look like it from his movements.  
  
  As I waited, I noticed a panda sitting on top of a pile of paper. It had what looked like delicate fur and two green gemstone eyes.  
  
  At last, he sat back, still masking the craft he'd put together with his hands. ""Ready?"" he asked.  
  
  I pushed my heart back into my rib cage, willing it to stay calm no matter what it was. ""Yes.""  
  
  Dr. Green stood, coming around the desk. When he was beside me, he shifted so the light fell in front of him.  
  
  In his hands was a delicate rose, curled up like a new bud on a stem, the petals just beginning to open. It was so realistic and so beautiful; if I hadn’t seen him make it in front of me, I would have believed it to be a real flower.  
  
  ""Wow,"" I said, unable to control my heart anymore. My fingers trembled and I reached to touch the delicate petals.  
  
  ""Not yet,"" he said softly.  
  
  I didn't know if I could handle much more of this surprise but he shifted his hands to begin a twisting motion from the stem.  
  
  As he moved, the rose opened, slowly unfold  
ing into a full bloom. It was like watching a time-lapse camera, with petals unfolding one layer at a time.  
  
  Across the petals, there were ink markings. Together, they spelled out a line of Japanese hiragana:  
  
  I didn’t know the Japanese, but I was struck with the beauty of the rose and how he’d made it bloom. Dr. Green had a skill; his work could be displayed in museums.  
  
  “What does it mean?” I asked.  
  
  He offered me the rose. I was hesitant, afraid to break it, but took it, pinching the little stem he’d made for it.  
  
  “Let me know when you figure it out,” he said with a soft smile. “I’ll give you bonus points.”  
  
  My heart fluttered like one of his paper birds above my head. I guessed they meant something sweet, but not knowing exactly left me excited and happy to find out.  
  
  It was amazing how he could do that. With just one little smile and joke, he made me feel so much lighter. He made it easy to feel comfortable with him.  
  
  “I guess this isn’t the spare room,” I said. “I didn’t mean to intrude.”  
  
  “Darling, my house is yours. Go wherever you want. Just not into the bedroom right now because your presents are in there.”  
  
  He moved to the door. “But we’ve got a gigantic pile of presents to wrap. Kota’s measuring presents to figure out what sizes of boxes we’ll need. Little does he know I just eyeball and if it’s too big a box, I just throw in more tissue paper.”  
  
  I held onto the flower, unsure where to place it while we’d be working. I looked for a spot to put it down in his office.  
  
  Dr. Green moved back to me and caught my wrist gently.  
  
  I froze, mostly affected at his holding my arm when I was already feeling excited. His touch was soothing.  
  
  He took the rose and lifted his arms. I felt him adjusting the hair clip at the back of my head. When his hands returned empty, I assumed he’d managed to put the rose in the clip. I was tempted to reach around to touch it but didn’t want to damage the delicate paper.  
  
  “I don’t want to lose it,” I said.  
  
  “I’ll keep an eye on you...it...No... I meant you.” He winked at me and then urged me to the door. “Go back to Kota. I’ll get the boxes.”",1,1758039655.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1nim1jk,https://www.reddit.com/r/AquaGearLab/comments/1nim1jk/discover_the_insinkerator_f1000_water_filter/,"Discover the InSinkErator F-1000 Water Filter Review for Cleaner, Tastier Tap Water!","**First Impressions**  
The InSinkErator F-1000 replacement, designed to enhance under-sink water filtration, immediately struck me as practical. As someone who relies heavily on clean water for drinking and cooking, the promise of removing particulates and reducing chlorine taste sounded almost too good to pass. This filter is a dedicated companion to the F-1000S and F-2000S water filtration systems, which made me a little curious about its adaptability if paired with anything else.

**Ease of Installation**  
Installing this water filter felt surprisingly simple. The twist-and-lock design is a lifesaver. I admit I’m no DIY expert, but the sanitary quick-change mechanism minimizes contact with the used filter and avoids any awkward struggle. The automatic shut-off valve when replacing cartridges was something I appreciated—it’s one of those minor conveniences you don't think about until you experience it.  

**Everyday Performance**  
Over the past few weeks, the tap water's taste leveled up. My coffee even tasted noticeably better, and I stopped cringing at the faint chemical tang that tap water sometimes leaves. The mention of NSF Standard 42 certification in the specs speaks volumes about its quality, particularly when it comes to reducing not just chlorine odors but particulates as well. 

[Check InSinkErator F-1000 price on Amazon.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b00dyiymzo/)  

**Flow Rate and Longevity**  
The filter offers a flow rate of 0.75 gallons per minute, which I found completely sufficient for routine kitchen tasks. With hints from other user reviews, replacing now and then every six months keeps things performing optimally. They claim a lifespan that reflects this, though I do think heavy water use might shorten the interval slightly.

**Quality for Price**  
Based on how the filter actually performs, it's hard to fault its value. While some might balk at the recurring cost of replacing filters twice a year, I’d label it as smart spending when weighed against consistent improvements to water quality. Plus, being NSF-certified seals the deal for me in terms of credibility and trustworthiness.

**Perks**  
- Twist-and-lock system for easy installation.  
- Effectively reduces chlorine taste and odor.  
- Maintains optimal flow rate for household needs.  

**Hurdles**  
- Compatibility limited strictly to InSinkErator systems, excluding SST-FLTR setup.  
- Requires ongoing replacements that could pile up in cost over time.  

**Product Competitors**  
This filter stands its ground against many contenders like Culligan or Aquasana under-sink solutions. Where this one shines uniquely is in its ease of installation. The twist-and-lock mechanism reduces the mess that some alternatives leave you to grapple with. However, Aquasana's premium models can lean ahead if removing diverse contaminants (like lead or cysts) is key for someone’s priorities. Culligan, on the other hand, might offer broader compatibility; they may not tether you exclusively to a matching system.

**Bang for the Buck**  
Given its ability to instantly improve water’s flavor while being eco-friendly, it fits the ""worth every penny"" checklist. Plastic bottles no longer take up much kitchen counter space in my home, and sustainability wins are long-term rewards.

  Virginia Sorrenson looked from my baffled expression to Shane's chagrined one. ""I was under the impression she knew what she was getting into, Shane. This does not appear to be the case.""  
  
  I turned to Shane. ""What's she talking about, Shane? You said going with you meant it was a declaration that we were together. You didn't say anything about any damn wedding.""  
  
  I saw Virginia's brows furrow at my vulgar language. Shane winced, and took my hand.  
  
  ""Yeah, I know, and I'm sorry. It's not like it's going to be next week or anything, Leo, just..."" he scrubbed his face with his hand. ""Let's talk about this later, okay? In private?""  
  
  I nodded.  
  
  Virginia seemed displeased. ""Shane, you should have been forthright with her from the beginning. It's not fair to her to be in the dark like this. She should know what she's getting into.""  
  
  ""I know,"" Shane said, pinching the bridge of his nose. ""Can we just get home? I'll explain everything.""  
  
  ""Everything?"" I asked. ""Is there more?""  
  
  Luke spoke up. ""With Shane, there's always more. He's not the most forthcoming man ever.""  
  
  The three other brothers all chuckled.  
  
  ""Let's just say there's probably more he's not saying than he is,"" Jon added.  
  
  ""We're his brothers, and he didn't tell us about his patents until after he'd made his first billion,"" Rob said.  
  
  I choked on my saliva. ""His first what?"" I looked from Shane, who seemed intensely pissed off, to Rob. ""His first billion with a 'B', or million with an 'M'?""  
  
  Virginia sighed. ""Billion, dear. With a capital 'B'. My tight-lipped son Shane here is worth nearly as much as his father."" She glared at Shane. ""You ought to be ashamed of yourself. This poor girl obviously knows nothing about you, and not through any fault of her own. This is the kind of thing you can't just spring on a girl, son.""  
  
  ""It's not like I wasn't going to tell her, I just--""  
  
  ""You want her to like you for more than your money,"" Virginia cut in. ""I know. We've been over this. But obviously things with Leona have progressed rather quickly. If she's to make an informed and responsible decision about her future with you, then she needs the facts. All of them, dear. Not just the ones you decide to part with.""  
  
  I turned away and stared out the tinted window. Our limo, which I suspected was worth more than my parents' house, was zipping smoothly along a narrow, winding road lined with spreading trees, now changing to brilliant reds, oranges, yellows and browns as fall descended on upstate New York. There was more to Shane Sorrenson than met the eye, clearly. I'd always known that. Even from the first time I met him, I knew he was more than just a biker. His carriage, his bearing, something in the ramrod stiffness of his spine spoke of breeding and sophistication. It hadn't clicked right away though, and he tried to brush it off, especially when it came out that he was the son of Henry James Sorrenson. And now, suddenly, those medical patents he'd so casually mentioned and dismissed weren't a trivial matter, and the company some little dot com existing on paper somewhere. He was a billionaire.  
  
  ""Shane, you told me you owned a few medical patents,"" I said, after a long, tense silence.  
  
  Shane didn't answer right away. He picked at a thread on the leg of his pants, not looking at anyone. ""First, I'm sorry. My brothers are right, in that I don't like to talk about myself. I don't like to flaunt my family name or my own personal wealth. Dad's money is his, earned by his hard work, over a lifetime. Mine is...well that's different. Those patents are meant to make life better for everyone, and it seems wrong somehow to capitalize on them.""  
  
  Virginia huffed in irritation. ""Oh for goodness' sake, Shane. Stop being so ridiculously egalitarian. Those patents are revolutionizing battlefield medicine. You've changed the medical world, son. You'd be a fool not to capitalize on it.""  
  
  ""Mother, I know. That's not the point. The point is, how do you tell someone your net worth without sounding arrogant? 'Hi, Leo, my name is Shane Sorrenson and I'm worth six billion dollars?' I don't fucking think so.""  
  
  ""Shane Alastair Sorrenson, I will not tolerate such vulgar language in my presence. This is not the United States Marine Corps.""  
  
  I stifled a giggle. Shane blushed red and mumbled a very boyish, ""Sorry, Mom.""  
  
  His brothers all seemed to have come down with coughing fits as well.  
  
  At that moment, the limousine pulled to a stop at the top of a circle driveway. All that was visible to me, through the dark window, was a wide set of marble steps leading to a pair of enormous, dark wood French doors and thick, elegant, fluted white columns.  
  
  The door was opened by an older, thick-set man with buzzed black hair and sunglasses as well as the kind of earpieces worn by Secret Service agents.  
  
  ""Ah, we've arrived,"" Virginia said, sliding out. The driver/bodyguard took her hand as she stepped out. ""Thank you, Gerald. Leona, come with me, if you would. I'll show you the house.""  
  
  I was next out, and I found myself lifted to my feet by Gerald's calloused, powerful hand. I mumbled, ""thanks,"" to the burly man and followed after Virginia, glancing back at Shane. I would have rather had Shane give me the tour, as I hadn't had a moment alone with him since the picnic in Sudan. For all that I was irritated with him for holding back the truth from me, he was still the one familiar thing in my life, which was suddenly a very tumultuous thing. Shane watched me go, a thousand emotions shifting across his handsome features.  
  
  The front doors swung open as Virginia approached them, held by a pair of uniformed...servants, I guess you would call them. I wasn't sure. Butlers? Maids? People who worked in the house. Virginia swept past them without so much as a glance, but I thanked both of them and tried to keep up. She was moving swiftly, clad in an elegant but simple floor-length dress. The house was palatial. I'd only seen places like this in movies. This was something out of Jane Eyre or Mansfield Park, endless expanses of marble floors, grand, curving staircases and extravagant crystal chandeliers, suits of armor.  
  
  I had stopped in the middle of the foyer, which was bigger than the house I'd lived in with John. Virginia noticed I'd stopped and drifted back to my side.  
  
  ""Don't let the trappings intimidate you, my dear. My husband has a flair for the dramatic. This house, if you can properly call such a monstrosity as this a house, is modeled after an eighteenth century British nobleman's estate. Something-upon-something-ford. I don't know. It's all grand and wonderful and entirely too big.""  
  
  ""How can I not be intimidated, Mrs. Sorrenson? This place is...god, it's incredible. I don't even know how to process what I'm seeing.""  
  
  ""Please, call me Virginia. And really, darling, it's just a house. A rather over-large one, but still, just a house.""  
  
  I snorted. ""Yeah, just a house. Okay."" Virginia cocked an eyebrow at me, which I was learning was a Sorrenson family trait. ""I'm sorry, I hope I didn't offend you. It is beautiful. It's just...overwhelming.""  
  
  ""Oh, well it is that, even to me, sometimes. Try finding someone in this house. If Henry isn't in his study, I need a search party and walkie talkies to find him. I told him we should get intercoms installed, but he said it wasn't authentic, and the electricity was bending the design enough as it was."" I must have looked surprised, because she laughed. ""Oh, you'll see what I mean about Henry when you meet him. He doesn't do things halfway. When he decided to do a period design, he originally wanted it to be completely authentic. All firepl  
aces and lamps and outhouses and so on. Well you can be sure I put my foot down. I told him he made it a normal, twenty-first century home, with TVs and electricity and indoor bathrooms and all that, or he could find someone else to live in it with him. But he refused on the intercoms, and I didn't push it. He did give me an entire wing of the house as a walk-in closet, after all.""  
  
  I widened my eyes at that. We were strolling through the house, which really was properly called a palace. There were sitting rooms with ornate, period-style furniture and fireplaces and Greco-Roman sculptures, a formal dining room big enough to seat at least fifty people, and a dozen other rooms, including a library that seemed to be a reproduction of the one in the animated Beauty and the Beast movie, with hundred-foot high ceilings and shelves of books stretching out of sight, lining every wall, with nooks and crannies and ladders and paintings.  
  
  ""An entire wing for clothes?"" I asked, as we neared a curving staircase wide enough to fit a Hummer.  
  
  ""Would you like to see it?"" Virginia asked.  
  
  Did I ever. Her 'closet' was two floors, connected by a private spiral staircase. It wasn't just racks of clothes in a giant room. It was a display, a museum, a department store. There was a room dedicated to dresses custom-made for her by all the top-name fashion designers, some in different colors of the same design. There was an entire room just for shoes, floor-to-ceiling shelves designed to display only shoes. I may have drooled, just a bit. There was another room for purses, organized by color, size, and designer. More drool. And yet another room for lingerie, and another for more mundane things like jeans and shirts and socks and such. I was speechless.  
  
  We found our way back to the shoe room. ""Henry calls this my 'shoe-seum',"" Virginia said. ""He says I have enough shoes that if we ever went bankrupt, I could open a shoe store. He may be right, but hey, a girl can never have too many shoes, right?""  
  
  I laughed. ""No, I suppose not. But then, I have three pairs of shoes at the moment, so I'm in no position to talk.""  
  
  Virginia lifted her eyebrow again. ""Three? Total?""  
  
  I shrugged. ""With me here, at least. I have more back in Detroit, but I left everything behind when I went to Africa with Shane. He told me he'd had it all packed up and moved out of my ex-fiance's house, so I still technically own them, but that doesn't do me too much good at the moment.""  
  
  Virginia led me to the kitchen, where she had coffee brought to us. ""So, tell me how you met Shane. I'd ask him, but you see how he is with information.""  
  
  ""Well...I'd just had an argument with my ex-fiance, John. The argument itself was one of those stupid things. It had started with something dumb he said to me, and I'd gotten pissed off. But it was more than that. John was boring. I've been realizing more and more that I was only with him because it was easier than breaking up. I mean, I guess I did care about him, I'd been with him for several years after all. But...he was uninteresting."" I stared into my coffee as I spoke. ""It was pouring rain, and I was wearing heels since we'd come from a party, and I just jumped out of the car and ran. I broke a heel and fell, scraped my knees and hands and all that. John was following me, but I wasn't listening. And then I ran into Shane. I mean, literally ran into him. He'd seen me running in the rain, apparently, and stopped to see if I needed help. I didn't see him and ran smack into his chest. I couldn't go back home, or to John's house, I guess I should say, so Shane took me to his, and then...""  
  
  ""I can guess the rest,"" Virginia said, a wry arch to her voice. ""How did you end up in Sudan with him, though? That's extremely unusual for him.""  
  
  I shrugged. ""I'm an ER nurse, and we'd talked about that, and his company that he started with his brothers. He asked me if I wanted to go with him, and arranged for it with the hospital I worked at and got me a passport. It was crazy, as I'd just met him, but...I needed a drastic change. When I had that argument with John, I'd had this vision of my life with him. It was the same thing, day after day, for the rest of my life. It scared me. So when Shane suggested going to Africa with him, it was impulsive and crazy and...it honestly was the best thing I've ever done. The hardest and most frightening, too, but the best. I felt alive, really alive, for the first time. And Shane...he took care of me. Protected me.""  
  
  Virginia nodded. ""That's Shane for you.""  
  
  This was a golden opportunity to learn about Shane, I realized. ""So, tell me about him. I mean, why is he the one to take over your husband's company and not one of the others?""  
  
  Virginia regarded me carefully. ""He's the best suited. The only one of them who's really capable of it, honestly. I love all my boys. They're all wonderful, capable men, and they've all done wonderful things with their lives. But Shane is the only one of them with the...business savvy."" She smiled at me. ""Would you like to hear a story about him, as a child?  
  
  ""When Shane was a boy, he decided he wanted to do a lemonade stand. Every child has one, at some point. Well, at the time, we were living in a condo in downtown New York City. Shane set up his little stand in the hallway outside our door, and sat there for about an hour, waiting. Well, eventually he came inside, disappointed because he hadn't sold any lemonade. He went to Henry, who was on a business call, settling a multi-million dollar deal, and asked what he was doing wrong.  
  
  ""Henry, without missing a beat, told him that he had to go where the business was, or he'd never sell anything. Shane took his advice to heart. He gathered his lemonade supplies and recruited Gerald to take him outside to set up. Gerald is a big old teddy bear with a heart of gold, and as much a nanny to all the kids as he is a bodyguard and driver. He helped Shane find a good spot out on Fifth Avenue, and stayed with him all day. I guess at one point, Shane ran out of supplies and sent Gerald to get more. About seven o'clock that night, Shane comes in, ecstatic but exhausted.  
  
  ""He'd made over two hundred dollars, selling cups of lemonade at seventy-five cents a piece. He stuck with it for an entire week, setting up in the same spot, from morning to night, breaking for lunch and dinner, and he made over a thousand dollars.  
  
  ""He was eight years old."" Virginia smiled at the memory. ""His brothers got wind of how much money he'd made and wanted in, so Henry told him how to expand. Henry hired a few extra temporary guards, friends of Gerald, I believe, and Shane set his three brothers up with their own stands a few blocks apart and showed them what to do. Shane gave them part of what they made and kept a portion for himself, as per Henry's instructions. Again, Shane was only eight years old.  
  
  ""He has a natural mind for business, he's just reluctant to take on the responsibility, and lose his freedom in the process. I'm sure you're aware of this, but running a company like Henry's is a huge undertaking. There will be a lot of publicity, which is the biggest thing Shane's been wanting to avoid.""  
  
  I absorbed this. I could see a little Shane, sitting outside in the middle of downtown Manhattan, selling lemonade. But I could also see Shane in a business suit, at a board meeting.  
  
  ""So...wow."" I held my coffee cup in both hands, processing what all this meant. ""I guess I can see why Shane would have to be careful who he's seen in public with. If he's about to become, like, a big business mogul, his public image is important.""  
  
  ""Precisely. I'm glad you see it that way,"" Virginia said. ""But there's more to it. Him having girlfriends is one thing. It's natural and expected. He's always been careful to make sure his private life is private. But he's only been working for himself, establishing his own career and his own business. Now, he's taking over Henry's company. It's an established business with a client list, an image, a reputation, investors and profit margins, and all that.  
  
  ""For men like Shane and Henry, the woman in their life is vitally important. You've heard the adage, 'behind every great man is a great woman', I'm sure? Well, that's never been truer. I helped Henry start his business. I was his first secretary, and I helped design his first ad campaign. Every major decision he's ever made has gone through me.  
  
  ""If our relationship suffers, or we get in a fight, and Henry has a hard time focusing on business, that can affect thousa  
nds of people. I'm not exaggerating. If we fight and Henry makes a poor decision because his mind is on us rather than business, he could lose millions of dollars.  
  
  ""That's what you're getting into, Leona. It's not just write-ups in the fashion rags and society columns, or appearances at galas and grand openings and such. It's business, it's your everyday life, your every decision having a domino effect on everything Shane does and down the ladder to the bottom of the company."" Virginia pinned me with a hard, level stare. ""Your actions reflect on him, even when you're out on the town, shopping, or having brunch with your girlfriends. Your reputation becomes his. If you're caught up in a scandal, it affects him, and thus downward to all the other stockholders and employees. Shane has never had casual girlfriends. He's had girls in his life, but it's been quiet, kept--not secret, but--""  
  
  ""On the down low,"" I put in.  
  
  ""Yes, very good. On the down low."" Virginia put her hand over mine. ""I don't mean to scare you or intimidate you, but I need you to know exactly what you're coming in to. What we expect of someone who intends to share Shane's life. You have to be above scandal, above reproach. We are not a family that tolerates our children making poor choices. We are a wealthy family, and we could have allowed our children to live a life leisure, but we don't. We've expected them to make their own way, and to be people who adhere to a moral standard. I don't know you very well, but I know Shane, and I know he wouldn't bring you into his life to the extent that he has if he didn't think you could meet our expectations. For yourself, you need to decide if this is what you want. Your life is no longer merely your own.""  
  
  I blew out a long breath. ""That's heavy.""  
  
  Virginia laughed. ""Yes, it is.""  
  
  ""And I have to decide, and soon?"" I asked. Virginia nodded. ""I care about Shane, and I really think there's something deeper to our relationship than sex. I'm sorry, I know he's your son, and that's awkward to think about, but I have no one else to talk to about this that will understand.""  
  
  ""No, it's fine. I do understand."" Virginia stood, and gestured for me to follow. ""Shane wouldn't have brought you here if he didn't believe in you, if he didn't think you could do it, and that there really is something deeper to your relationship than sex. He wouldn't have brought you to Sudan, if he didn't. That was a test, I think. He's always been a shrewd judge of character, and I trust his instincts.",1,1758039523.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

1nim065,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Adventurous_Rough797/comments/1nim065/what_is_an_emergency_fund_and_why_its_your_1/,"What is an Emergency Fund, and Why It's Your #1 Financial Priority","You’ve heard the advice a thousand times: “Build an emergency fund.” It sounds simple, but when you’re staring at a tight budget, it can feel utterly impossible. After 15 years as a financial advisor, I’ve guided countless clients from $0 to a fully-funded safety net. The secret isn’t a magic trick or a huge windfall; it’s a systematic, behavioral approach.

# According to Bankrate's Emergency Savings Report (2024) 56% of U.S. adults lack enough savings to cover 6 months of expenses. This includes those with some savings, but not enough. That’s why articles like that have a right to exist as people must be educated in this field. So today you will learn what is an emergency fund, in what cases it can be useful for you and what amount will be enough for you.

**What Exactly** ***Is*** **an Emergency Fund?**

An emergency fund (EF) is not a savings account for a new TV, a vacation, or even a predictable expense like your annual insurance premium. It is a dedicated pool of **liquid, accessible cash** that exists for one purpose only: to cover unexpected, necessary expenses without derailing your financial life.

**True Emergencies Include:**

·         A sudden job loss or significant reduction in income.

·         A major medical or dental emergency not fully covered by insurance.

·         Urgent home repairs (e.g., a broken furnace, a major leak).

·         Critical car repairs (your primary mode of transportation to work).

·         An unforeseen family emergency requiring travel.

In situations like that we are ready to enter into long-term obligations with payment.But it’s not always the way out. I suggest relying on your own strength in the form of an EF.

# Step 1: Shift Your Mindset: It's a ""Financial Airbag,"" Not a Savings Account

The first hurdle is psychological. Most people fail because they view this fund as extra money they can dip into for a vacation or a sale. An expert reframes its purpose.

·         **Expert View:** Your emergency fund is a **financial airbag**. You never want to use it, but its sole purpose is to protect you in a crash. A true emergency is **unexpected, necessary, and urgent.** A job loss is an emergency. A 50% off sale at your favorite store is not. A broken water heater is an emergency. A last-minute concert ticket is not.

# Step 2: Define Your ""Starter"" Goal: The $500 Mini-Milestone

The classic advice is to save 3-6 months of expenses. For someone starting from zero, that number is paralyzing. **Ignore it for now.**

Your first goal is not six months. It’s **$500**.

Why $500? Because data from the Federal Reserve shows that a $400 unexpected expense would force many Americans into debt. Your first $500 breaks that cycle. It’s a small, achievable win that provides tangible psychological momentum. Celebrate hitting this target!

# Step 3: Find Your Seed Money: The ""Low-Hanging Fruit"" Audit

You need your first $100. Where does it come from? Experts don’t just cut coffee; they conduct a strategic audit.

·         **Example 1: The Subscription Purge.** Open your banking app. Scan the last three months for recurring subscriptions ($15/month gym you don't use, $11/month streaming service, $10/month app subscription). Canceling just three frees up **$36/month** or **$432/year**.

·         **Example 2: The ""No-Spend"" Challenge.** Pick one category for one month. No eating out. No new clothes. No random Amazon purchases. Redirect every penny you would have spent. This can easily free up **$100-$200** in a single month.

·         **Example 3: The Micro-Side Hustle.** Sell old books, electronics, or clothes online. Dedicate the entire profit to your fund. One client of mine made **$300** in a weekend cleaning out her closet.

# Step 4: Automate the Habit: ""Pay Yourself First""

Willpower is a terrible savings strategy. Experts use automation.

·         **How to Do It:** The day after your paycheck clears, set up an automatic transfer of a small, manageable amount—**even if it's just $25**—from your checking account to a dedicated savings account. Name the account “AIRBAG” or “PEACE OF MIND” in your banking app.

·         **Why It Works:** The money is gone before your brain even registers it’s there. You learn to live on what remains. This is the single most powerful tool for building savings consistently.

# Step 5: Choose the Right ""Container"": The High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)

Do not let your emergency fund rot in your standard bank’s checking or savings account, which may pay 0.01% interest. You need a **High-Yield Savings Account (HYSA)**.

·         **What it is:** An FDIC-insured savings account offered by online banks that pays a significantly higher interest rate (often 20-25 times the national average).

·         **Why it's essential:**

1.     **Safety:** Your money is protected and not invested in the volatile stock market.

2.     **Liquidity:** You can access it within 1-3 business days.

3.     **Growth:** While not meant to get rich, your money earns a return that helps fight inflation. Earning 4.5% is better than 0.01%.

# Step 6: Scale Up: From $500 to 3-6 Months

Once you have your starter $500, the fear is gone. Now, you scale.

1.     **Calculate Your Monthly ""Survival"" Budget:** Add only your essential expenses: rent/mortgage, utilities, groceries, transportation, minimum debt payments, and insurance.

2.     **Set Your Ultimate Target:** Multiply that number by 3 for a basic safety net, or by 6 for a more robust one.

3.     **Increase Your Automatic Transfer:** Now that you’ve proven you can save $25 or $50 a week, can you increase it to $75 or $100? Apply any raises, tax refunds, or bonuses directly to this fund to turbocharge its growth.

# Putting It All Together: A Real-World Example

Meet **Maria**, a graphic designer.

·         **Step 1:** She commits to the ""airbag"" mindset.

·         **Step 2:** Her goal is **$500**.

·         **Step 3:** She finds her seed money:

o    Cancels two unused subscriptions: **+$25/month**

o    Does a ""no-restaurants"" month: **+$150**

o    Sells an old camera on eBay: **+$125**

o    **Total Seed Money: $300**

·         **Step 4:** She opens a new HYSA earning 4.5% APY and names it ""My Safety Net."" She sets up an automatic transfer of **$50** every payday (twice a month).

·         **The Math:** Her $300 seed money + $100/month in automatic savings gets her to her $500 goal in just two months.

·         **Step 6:** Feeling empowered, Maria calculates her essential expenses are $3,000/month. She increases her automatic transfer to $200/month to eventually build a 3-month ($9,000) fund.

Building an emergency fund is a journey, not a sprint. It’s the most profound gift of security you can give yourself and your family. Start small, be consistent, and leverage automation. Your future, crisis-proof self will thank you.
