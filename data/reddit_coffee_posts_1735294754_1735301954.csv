it’s happened and no one has come back to do a check on it since the last service request back in August or October I believe.

**Nuisance complaint**
I'm sure this is very minor but it has become a very pressing issue I live off Pimlico Pkwy and 3023 Pimlico Pkwy in Lexington has had noisy dogs for the past years I have been here I have been blamed for the loud dogs and at this point I feel it's the safest option to report this neighbor for a noise nuisance. I'm not looking to fine my neighbor by any means but this is downright out of control and I have tried everything from talking to my neighbor, befriending the dogs, using white noise, and blatantly ignoring it. I feel the best approach is to make it known this isn't ok behavior. I have lost alot of sleep as well as patience with this neighbor so I feel the best option is to address it via a warning. I want to remain anonymous in this situation if it is at all possible.

**Housing Complaint - Non Emergency**
I began my rental in October, but I did not move in until November. I paid everything in full. I have connected the lights, water and gas. I paid rental insurance and landlord insurance upon my moving in. I’ve been charged for a late payment which was already received to them, but then they added an extra tax to make it where I my payment was returned so therefore it was $75. I had to pay now within the month of November, my heat was not working. It took them two weeks to come and fix it to make it blow blow heat then the end of November 22 my stove went out. I did not have a stove up until December 23 then I was charged $40 on my monthly bill because I missed the appointment time to be here for them to come and check my stove, which I had already have information telling that lady that they could use the key to come in and maintenance the stove I don’t really believe that I’m supposed to be charged for missing the appointment when I when that when the landlord knows that I work every day eight hour shifts a day and they I’ve already listed on the maintenance service complaint that I was not gonna be home and they can get the key and come in Next within the same time they had to come back and fix my heat again because it stopped blowing heat and at this time I still do not have a stove. They didn’t bring me a stove for a whole month from November 22 to December 23. They brought the stove on the 23rd And I called the landlord and asked them for me to get a discount on my rent because it was inhabited for me not to have a stove for a whole month and breakages of my furnace heat not blowing heat when I have paid my gas bill and I have not heard back from themand I just want them to understand. We haven’t not having a stove having all the appliances working in the home is inhabited then within December, the knobs broke off in tub in the bathroom. They came immediately and fixed that but still I had no heat at that moment. The people downstairs had a sewage problem &mold

Then we went to the mall and during the conversation she also talked about how unfortunate it is that I don't have a car ( we went on hers and I paid the fees and coffees). She's beautiful and cute but she always keeps on nagging about stuff that we don't have instead of enjoying the moment. Now she sent me a message to go to the movies and I accepted I said why not. After the request she told me that it's unfortunate that we can't go to another city to watch the movie in better conditions and how it would be wonderful for me to have a car or if we can find a group of friends that can assist us to go to that town ( which is far away from ours). I told her that I'm cancelling the whole thing because I don't feel like it anymore. She said why and she just said that it would be nice if we can do stuff but we can still go but I refused. Is it just me or does this feel like weird and confusing since u invite someone you either enjoy what you have or stop crying About what you don't especially that I suggested going with a group of friends of mine to that town whenever it is possible. She said it would be fantastic to go this Sunday but I told her that it's not possible because it depends on their plans and the trip which could be mid January. She said that's bad and I wish we can go this Sunday. I feel bad , cuz I can only afford and enjoy what I currently have but she doesn't .....

Tldr : my date keeps on wishing and wishing and doesn't enjoy life as it currently is ",2,1735301122.0,relationships,1,1.0,False

To check the foundations, workers dug about 10 feet down at several spots in the sanctuary. The restoration project morphed into an archaeological one as old structures reemerged.”

“Excavations uncovered a staircase leading into a forgotten cellar. The underground vault dated back at least 400 years, but its entrance had been covered in the 1970s, the institute said.”

When we hung out, she sat in the front seat and ended up talking to him for over 1 hour including the journey and the destination. He was no saint but she knew what she was doing. I still gave her a benefit of doubt and moved on. 

I found my ex a year after this and she was head over heels after looking at his merc. She apparently asked my best friend ""how I landed this guy"" and was seemingly envious. 

My ex was secretly a womanizer and when she slid into his DMs, he didn't mind the attention. Fast forward to a couple of days of their interaction, She asked him out for a coffee. And he agreed. 

She never EVER mentioned me about this. Had my asshole ex weren't so passionate to make me feel like shit, I would've never known. I broke up after. And I waited for the woman to tell me which never happened. I confronted her and she never apologized saying ""I was lonely and had low self esteem"" 

On my birthday, Karma got to her. Her own situationship cheated on her with her bestie in a new city. She randomly texts me about it. 

But now....she's got a providing boyfriend and she's doing well for herself. I'm just struck holding this grudge I can't let go of. 

All she ever saw in all these boys was if they were well to do. She's a gold digger. I just hate women with ulterior motive like her getting what they want. ",2,1735301025.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

If Bitcoin - perceived as MicroStrategy's digital child - rallies above $138,000, this could push MicroStrategy's market cap above that of Starbucks and Nike. Over the past year, MicroStrategy has embarked on an aggressive Bitcoin buying spree, establishing itself as a key player in corporate Bitcoin adoption. If Bitcoin achieves the aforementioned price, the value of Bitcoin in MicroStrategy's balance sheets would significantly increase. MicroStrategy stands the chance to surpass Starbucks and Nike, companies that have revolutionized their respective fields of coffee and sportswear, respectively. However, this is all subject to the unpredictable world of cryptocurrency. It remains to be seen whether MicroStrategy will succeed in its ambitious bid.

Some examples are I used to use floss sticks because I do not have the mobility in my fingers to use regular floss. One dentist shamed me for it and told me those are garbage and to stop using them. Then my current dentist I admitted I had to switch bad to floss sticks because I couldn’t get all of my teeth with regular floss. They asked why I was ashamed of that and flossing is flossing so matter what is used to do it.

Through out the years it’s been many other things. No coffee! No coffee with creamer. No citrus. No baking soda tooth paste. No gum. Only sugar free gum…. The list goes on.

If I add it all up there would be nothing left to eat or drink. Even left with no tooth brushes or tooth paste left to buy.

So is there an actual list or does it just change to that certain dentists preferences? ",1,1735300809.0,askdentists,2,1.0,False

I bought my first home a few months ago, this flat. Having ticked off the main bits (attic/chimney repairs, gas/electric) and the carpet will be getting changed next I am turning my mind to what I’d like to do in the living room. All the places I’ve lived in have been square and this isn’t so I am struggling! This is our main room for curling up and watching tv❤️

Feel free to completely redesign the space, including a lot of the furniture, most of it has come from our previous home and I’m not sure it’ll fit. Only caveats are 

- the sofa is still being paid off but it’s an ikea one so I can change the cover. The chair is electric and reclines and was a ball ache to get in haha! 
- I can’t remove the carpets as I am an upstairs flat 
- the coffee table has loads of storage and it’s my fave item in the house!
- the cats need something to climb (see the Xmas tree for reference on the climbing part 🤣)

The room doesn’t get much sunlight and seems quite dark as well which is a struggle!!

The paint samples on the wall are paint ideas, I think I’m doing the middle lighter teal colour on that wall.

Thanks for all your help if you can ❤️❤️ I am so lost with all of this 🤣",1,1735300697.0,DesignMyRoom,6,1.0,False

And recently as we were catching up for coffee he mentioned he had a gf and they had been dating for 2 months.He mentioned her very briefly and we went on with our conversation. And we still talk and text. However for whatever reason this news has me crushed and heartbroken. I had never really had such deep feelings and connection  with anyone in my life as it was with him.

1hndc4o,https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgmndd847eo,Anger and frustration over Galloway national park plan,">The halfway point has been reached in an extended public consultation into whether Galloway should become Scotland's third national park.

>NatureScot is conducting the process which ends on 14 February, two weeks later than originally tabled to take into account the festive period.

>So, after weeks of public meetings, paper and online consultations, has anyone changed their mind?

>There has been anger and frustration among both supporters and objectors in what has turned out to be one of the most contentious issues raised in Dumfries and Galloway.

>What is being decided?

>There are three potential boundaries for a new national park.

>Option one concentrates on hills and coast, option two hills and extended coast and option three hills, coast and countryside.

>Part of South Ayrshire would be within the boundary and possibly East Ayrshire too.

>There are concerns from those against the plans that there is not an option to choose a plain no.

>However, the questions on the consultation online ask if someone strongly opposes the move.

>The cost of a new park is undecided but it is likely to be £5m or more according to estimates from NatureScot.

>What is the process?

>NatureScot is in charge of the consultation and will report back to the Scottish government with its findings in April.

>A total of 52,000 households and businesses received a paper copy of the consultation. And 29 public events have been tabled across south west Scotland, including parts of Ayrshire which could come under the park's boundary if it goes ahead.

>There have also been two online events with another scheduled for January 14.

>Stuart Graham, NatureScot's operations manager for south Scotland, told BBC Scotland News: ""By all means have your say whether yes, you want a national park or no, you don't, but in particular we really need reasons, we really need details as to why that is, as that will help us inform back to government.""

>The No campaign has pushed for a referendum on the matter which has been backed by Dumfries and Galloway councillors

>They have been putting pressure on the Scottish government which had already turned down the suggestion, saying all views would be considered in the ongoing consultation.

>Who is in favour?

>Those in support say the status will bring extra investment and tourists.

>Rob Lucas, chairman of the Galloway National Park Association, said the heat in the debate was ""frustrating"" and that the conversation being carried out was ""closing down"" debate.

>Stranraer could be within the boundary area if either option 2 or 3 is chosen.

>Allan Jenkins works on economic regeneration projects in the town.

>He said: ""Stranraer has suffered one blow after another, especially when the ferries moved out and we lost so many visitors and so much trade.

>""A new national park would give businesses a reason to invest here and visitors more reasons to come here and stay for a while.""

>The former mining village of Dalmellington in East Ayrshire is also in need of a boost and a park would bring much needed hope to young people and families there, according to Mark Gibson who runs the Craigengillan Estate.

>He farms, carries out conservation work and runs holiday accommodation.

>He said farmers and landowners were the wealthiest people within the proposed park's boundary and thinks the emphasis must be on reversing decline in the wider communities.

>Mr Gibson said minor changes to planning applications should not be put ahead of ""the futures of thousands of kids"" and said a national park could ""change things for the better"".

>""We have warm-hearted people, landscapes and altogether we can bring about a glad new day,"" he said.

>Who is against?

>Denise Brownlee and Liz Hitschmann, who both live in Gatehouse of Fleet, started the campaign against having a national park in Galloway.

>It has become a strong and vocal opposition.

>They said the roads infrastructure needed to be upgraded first before encouraging more visitors.

>They highlighted the fact that if the A75 - which brings traffic from the ferry terminals at Cairnryan across Dumfries and Galloway to Gretna - is closed, HGVs are diverted through narrow roads and villages.

>Soaring house prices and low-paying jobs in the service industry are also of concern.

>Ms Brownlee said: ""Having lived and worked in the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park, I've seen damage to the area and nature. I don't want that happening here.

>""I don't want the kids' only prospects to be making coffees or beds up. If we had the infrastructure sorted, we could have businesses coming in on the back of that.""

>The Scottish NFU has announced that it is actively against a park being established in Galloway.

>South West Scotland is the biggest dairy farming area in Scotland.

>There are almost 180 herds in Dumfries and Galloway, ranging in size from 60 cows to more than 1,000.

>Farms are a place of work, the home and the future for the next generation, making it a personal debate for many in the sector.

>Ian Cruickshanks is the fourth generation at his farm at Borgue near Kirkcudbright.

>""I am genuinely worried,"" he said. ""We have invested heavily in infrastructure but it could all be lost.""

>He worries about his children. ""They will have to move to strive rather than become park rangers or limited with the ability to farm under a national park tied up in bureaucracy.

>""The overall anger in the area will lead to unrest if the government doesn't listen.""

>Mr Cruickshanks has two sons and a daughter who have studied agriculture at university.

>His son Scott, 24, is chairman of Stewartry Young Farmers and says the future looks bleak under a park.

>""It's going to be a hindrance to my ability to invest and improve facilities,"" he said. ""It's going to be an absolute destruction of what I hope for in my future.""

>NatureScot denies that park status would constrain farmers and said it is keen to work with them.

>Catriona Forrest lives near Castle Douglas and said she initially thought a park sounded like a good idea but has since changed her mind.

>She does not believe the consultation is democratic and said an independent, academic review would be the best way forward.

>""The issue now is the information and misinformation on the benefits of a national park,"" she said. ""I don't believe in them but it's hard to unpick and work out what we'd be getting.

>""I think an independent review carried out by say IPSOS or a university would give us the pros and cons and we'd know what we were facing.""

>Other sectors?

>Apart from farming, the other sectors vital to the economy of south west Scotland are tourism and forestry.

>As a government body, Forestry and Land Scotland remains neutral in the debate.

>The Confederation of Forest Industries has said in previous reports that it is the ""bedrock"" of areas such as Dumfries and Galloway and is a billion pound industry in Scotland.

>Tourism supports 9,472 jobs and brought in £582m to Dumfries and Galloway, according to the South of Scotland Destination Alliance - a marketing organisation representing about 660 businesses, communities and social enterprises involved in the visitor economy across the region.

>Chief executive David Hope Jones said: ""Tourism is not a dirty word. It is an essential part of our economic prosperity.

>""An appropriately governed, light-touch national park can be used to attract responsible, high-spending visitors - helping our local businesses to keep staff employed, year-round, in quality jobs.""

>Nature Scot said it was for the people of Galloway to shape the park to benefit them and to have a say on how far reaching its authority would be. Around a third of the board would be local people.",1,1735300487.0,RewildingUK,0,1.0,False

1hndbha,https://www.reddit.com/r/Teethgumhealth/comments/1hndbha/flexible_spending_account_teeth_whitening/,Flexible Spending Account Teeth Whitening,"Benefits of Using a Flexible Spending Account for Teeth Whitening
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Are you looking to enhance your smile with teeth whitening treatments? Utilizing a flexible spending account (FSA) can make this aesthetic upgrade much more affordable. Here are a few key benefits of using an FSA for teeth whitening:

### Cost Savings

Teeth whitening can be expensive, especially when you opt for professional treatments. By using funds from your flexible spending account, you can cover these out-of-pocket expenses without stretching your budget. Since contributions to an FSA are made pre-tax, you effectively reduce your taxable income. This means you're paying less in taxes, and the money you save can directly subsidize your teeth whitening.

### Easy Access to Funds

Flexible spending accounts allow you to set aside funds throughout the year for eligible medical expenses. You can use these pre-funded amounts immediately for your teeth whitening treatment. Whether you choose in-office treatments or at-home kits, having access to these funds simplifies the payment process.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Included Treatments

Many people are surprised to find that teeth whitening is commonly covered under FSA guidelines. This includes:

- In-office bleaching sessions
- Take-home whitening kits prescribed by your dentist
- Whitening strips and gels that meet FSA eligibility

It’s essential to double-check with your FSA administrator to confirm the specific treatments that are covered, as eligibility can vary based on the plan.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Improved Oral Health

While the main goal of teeth whitening is to enhance your smile, it can also encourage better oral hygiene practices. When you invest in whitening your teeth, you may be more motivated to maintain your dental health. This includes regular brushing, flossing, and dental visits. When you feel proud of your smile, you’re likely to take better care of it.

### Boost in Confidence

A whiter smile can significantly boost your confidence. Whether you’re preparing for a job interview, a special event, or simply wanting to feel better about yourself, brightening your smile can make a positive impact. Using an FSA to finance your whitening treatments means you're not only investing in your appearance but also in your self-esteem.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Tax Benefits

Contributions made to an FSA are not subject to income tax, which means the money you spend on teeth whitening reduces your overall taxable income. This tax incentive adds another layer of financial benefit, allowing you to allocate those savings towards additional treatments or other healthcare needs. It's a smart way to get more value from your healthcare expenses.

### Flexibility in Spending

Unlike Health Savings Accounts (HSAs), FSAs typically have a 'use-it-or-lose-it' rule, which encourages you to spend the money saved within the plan year. This can prompt you to prioritize dental enhancements like teeth whitening. Planning your dental care within the FSA's timeline can lead to better overall health outcomes.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
### Streamlined Planning

Using an FSA makes planning for teeth whitening easy. You can estimate how much you want to set aside for elective procedures and align this budget with your overall healthcare goals. This financial foresight makes it easier to ensure you're making the most of your benefits.

### Simple Claims Process

Once you've undergone treatment, claiming your teeth whitening expenses is generally straightforward. You simply need to provide your dentist’s receipt and any necessary documentation to your FSA administrator. This hassle-free process allows you to quickly get reimbursed for your expenses, putting your mind at ease while you enjoy your new smile.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Using a flexible spending account for teeth whitening is a practical and beneficial choice. You'll enjoy the financial savings, gain easy access to the funds needed for treatments, and experience the boost in confidence that comes with a brighter smile. So, if you're considering teeth whitening, don’t forget to take full advantage of your FSA – it could be your key to a radiant change!

Cost-Effective Alternatives to Professional Teeth Whitening
-----------------------------------------------------------

Having a bright smile can enhance your confidence and improve your overall appearance. However, professional teeth whitening treatments can be quite expensive and are not always accessible for everyone. Fortunately, there are several cost-effective alternatives that can help you achieve a whiter smile without breaking the bank.

### Over-the-Counter Whitening Kits

One of the most popular alternatives to professional whitening is over-the-counter whitening kits. These kits are widely available at pharmacies and grocery stores. They typically include whitening strips, gels, or trays that you can easily apply at home. Many products use carbamide peroxide or hydrogen peroxide as the active ingredient to remove stains and lighten your teeth. Here are a few benefits:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Convenience:** You can use these kits at your own pace, making it simple to fit into your schedule.
- **Affordability:** Most kits are significantly less expensive than professional treatments.
- **Variety:** You can choose from various applications to find one that suits you best.

When selecting an over-the-counter product, read reviews and look for those that are ADA-approved for safety and effectiveness.

### Whitening Toothpaste

Whitening toothpaste is another budget-friendly option. These toothpastes contain mild abrasives and special chemical agents designed to remove surface stains. While they won’t produce results as dramatic as professional whitening, they can help maintain the whiteness of your teeth. Look for toothpastes with the following features:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Peroxide Content:** Some whitening toothpastes have small amounts of hydrogen peroxide.
- **ADA Seal:** Choose products with the American Dental Association seal for proven effectiveness.

Regular use of whitening toothpaste can help you achieve a brighter smile over time.

### Natural Home Remedies

If you prefer to explore natural methods, various home remedies can be effective for teeth whitening. Here are some popular options:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Baking Soda:** Creating a paste with baking soda and water can help remove stains due to its mild abrasive properties. Use this sparingly to avoid damaging enamel.
- **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This natural bleaching agent can be mixed with water to create a mouth rinse. Swish it around for a few minutes before spitting it out.
- **Apple Cider Vinegar:** Mixing apple cider vinegar with water can create a teeth-whitening rinse. However, use this method infrequently as it can erode enamel.

Remember to consult your dentist before trying these remedies, especially if you have sensitive teeth.

### Diet and Lifestyle Changes

Your daily habits can significantly affect the whiteness of your smile. Making simple lifestyle adjustments can help prevent further staining and maintain your results. Here’s what you can do:

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
- **Avoid Staining Foods and Drinks:** Limit consumption of coffee, tea, red wine, and dark berries, which are known to stain teeth.
- **Quit Smoking:** Tobacco products can lead to significant discoloration, so quitting can greatly improve your smile.
- **Drink Water:** Drinking water after meals can help wash away food particles and prevent staining.

By adopting these dietary habits, you can contribute to a brighter smile naturally.

### Regular Dental Cleanings

Don’t underestimate the power of regular dental cleanings. Visiting your dentist for cleanings every six months can help remove surface stains and tartar buildup, making your teeth look brighter. This preventative care is a cost-effective way to maintain your oral health and improve your smile’s appearance.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Ultimately, there are many cost-effective alternatives to professional teeth whitening that can help you achieve a beautiful smile. By utilizing over-the-counter products, natural remedies, and making mindful dietary choices, you can enhance your smile without extensive expenditures. Remember to consult with your dentist about the best whitening options suitable for your individual needs.

### Conclusion

Choosing to use a flexible spending account (FSA) for teeth whitening can be a smart financial move. FSAs allow you to set aside pre-tax dollars specifically for qualified medical expenses, including dental procedures like teeth whitening. This means you can enjoy a brighter smile while potentially saving money on taxes. By utilizing an FSA, you not only take advantage of these savings but also prioritize your oral health, making it easier and more affordable to enhance your confidence through a gleaming smile.

On the other hand, cost-effective alternatives to professional teeth whitening can also be beneficial. While professional treatments offer significant results, there are many DIY whitening options that can lighten your teeth without emptying your wallet. Over-the-counter whitening strips, whitening toothpaste, and natural remedies such as baking soda or activated charcoal can all offer noticeable improvements. The key is to find a method that suits your budget and lifestyle, striking a balance between cost and effectiveness.

Check The Details Here: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com  
  
Even if you opt for less expensive whitening solutions, remember that maintaining a good oral hygiene routine plays a crucial role in the longevity of your results. Regular brushing, flossing, and dental check-ups can prolong the effects of whitening treatments—professional or at-home.

Combining the benefits of an FSA with affordable teeth whitening methods can lead to a healthier, more radiant smile. You can achieve the results you desire without the financial strain, making your dental care a priority in your overall health plan. So, consider your options, budget wisely, and take the steps necessary to shine both inside and out.

And I just...

he was the epitome of the dating life I wanted to leave behind: clingy, off putting texts he eventually stopped responding to, driving him around, having platonic lunch together. he was the final straw that cracked my nice-girl dating paradigm. It made sense to just fade away and have some self-respect... so greeting him a happy birthday (months ago) was the last thing I ever did before we just kinda stopped being friends.

I had saved my pocket money and gone around the neighbourhood washing cars for months to save up . Gave her the ticket in early October, festival was end of January. We would often sit together and write up a schedule of who we would see and when. Also to note, we were around 18, me slightly older and I had been in the waiting room of the hospital as a baby in my mums arms while she was being born. 

Day before the festival, she calls me to let me know she “forgot” to request the day off work (K-Mart, four hour shift), so could I just sell the ticket and give her the cash? This was at a time when internet in every home was unheard of and I had no way to sell online. Cue malicious compliance. I knew a friend who was desperate for a ticket but it was sold out. Offered it to her for $10 and she gratefully accepted. When the weather hit 43 degrees Celsius on the day and I as wearing jeans, she also bought me a tie dyed summer slip dress and a beer as an additional thank you. 

Next day I see the best friend when our mums were catching up over a coffee. I hand her the $10 and tell her it was the best I could get at such short notice. She slapped me across the face and called me a thieving “b!tch”, saying I could have gotten more than that if I tried. 

Her mum totally lost her sh!t, called her ungrateful and rude. Straight up told the daughter (my so called best friend), to hand me back the $10 immediately and apologise. Also added in for her daughter that unless she wanted to be homeless instead of living rent/board free, she would be paying me back the entire cost of the ticket from her next pay check. 

She did and we rapidly drifted apart after that. I still speak to her mum every couple of weeks. Love that woman for who she is and the friend she was to my deceased mum. My contact with the friend is basically once a year to say hi/Merry Christmas, yet every other year she reminds me of how I cheaped out on her that time.

**Roast: I'm using fresh medium-dark/dark roast beans**

**Basket: 2 cup, single-walled**

I'm tracking all variables, including weighing both my input and output when grinding and I'm also weighing the final espresso.

So far, I'm getting very watery shots (around 55g) that come out in 15 seconds (pre-infusion around 7/8). I've adjusted the internal burr to 4 from the factory setting of 6 and have the grind setting on the machine at its finest (1 out of 30), which already causes issues as there's no wiggle room. At this point, I've tried everything I can think of. I've upped the dose to 21g from 18g to see if the added pressure would help. It did, but only slightly, and the puck was way too full and also scorched from the group head. I've reduced the dose and it came out way worse, and the puck was a flooded mess. I'm distributing and tamping consistently for each shot I pull.

After pulling like 15-20 shots, I simply checked the coarseness of the grind (probably should have noticed this sooner) and it looks *way* too coarse. I make pourover daily at home and it's honestly not too far off that. You can hear the granules when pinching between fingers and it's more like a slightly finer granulated sugar and nowhere near a powdery texture like it should be for espresso. This is *after* I've adjusted the internal burrs as everyone recommends with this machine.

I've watched a lot of videos of people dialling in this machine and they're all pulling decent shots without being on the finest setting.

I'm beginning to think maybe the machine is just faulty and there's something up with the burrs and I'm one shot away from calling Sage to come and diagnose (if they have a maintenance service) or just recommend that they return the machine.

Anyone else had a similar issue with the Barista Pro? TIA!",1,1735300013.0,espresso,1,1.0,False

For businesses in Mesa, Arizona, the competitive landscape demands a focus on local search engine optimization (SEO) to stand out and thrive. But what exactly is Mesa SEO, and how can it unlock success for your business? Let's dive in.

# What is Mesa SEO?

[Mesa SEO](https://nventmarketing.com/mesa-seo/) refers to strategies tailored specifically to help businesses in Mesa improve their visibility on search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. Unlike broader SEO tactics, local SEO zeroes in on targeting potential customers in a specific geographic area. By optimizing for local search, you ensure that your business appears prominently when users search for products or services ""near me"" or in Mesa.

# Why Local SEO Matters

Over 90% of consumers use search engines to find local businesses. When your business ranks high in local search results, it not only increases visibility but also builds trust among potential customers. With Mesa being home to a thriving business community and diverse population, tapping into local SEO can connect you to the right audience at the right time.

# Key Components of Mesa SEO

1. **Google Business Profile Optimization**
   * Claim and verify your Google Business Profile.
   * Ensure your business name, address, and phone number (NAP) are accurate.
   * Add high-quality photos, respond to reviews, and update your hours of operation.
2. **Local Keyword Research**
   * Identify keywords specific to your industry and location (e.g., ""Mesa coffee shop,"" ""plumber in Mesa"").
   * Use tools like Google Keyword Planner or Ahrefs to discover popular search terms.
3. **On-Page SEO**
   * Optimize meta titles and descriptions with local keywords.
   * Create localized content, such as blog posts highlighting Mesa events or community insights.
   * Add location-specific schema markup to help search engines understand your business's relevance to Mesa.
4. **Citations and Local Listings**
   * Ensure consistency across all online directories, including Yelp, Yellow Pages, and industry-specific platforms.
   * Use tools like Moz Local or BrightLocal to manage and audit your citations.
5. **Mobile Optimization**
   * Ensure your website is mobile-friendly, as most local searches occur on mobile devices.
   * Focus on fast loading times, intuitive navigation, and a seamless user experience.
6. **Online Reviews and Reputation Management**
   * Encourage satisfied customers to leave positive reviews on platforms like Google, Yelp, and Facebook.
   * Respond promptly to both positive and negative feedback to demonstrate customer care.

# Benefits of Mesa SEO

* **Increased Visibility:** Rank higher on search results and maps, ensuring potential customers find you first.
* **Higher Conversion Rates:** Local SEO targets users with high purchase intent, driving more traffic and sales.
* **Improved Trust and Credibility:** Appearing in local search results and earning positive reviews build confidence in your brand.
* **Competitive Advantage:** Stand out from competitors who may not be leveraging local SEO effectively.

# Partnering with a Mesa SEO Expert

While some businesses may choose to handle SEO in-house, partnering with a local SEO expert can yield faster and more effective results. Local experts understand the Mesa market, including its unique demographics and search trends, ensuring your strategy is tailored for success.

# Take the First Step Today

The digital landscape is constantly evolving, and staying ahead requires a proactive approach. By investing in Mesa SEO, you position your business for long-term success in a competitive market. Whether you’re a small local shop or a larger enterprise, the right local SEO strategy can make all the difference.

I apologise, explain it's a brand new bell and it's turned out to not be that great and somehow we got chatting about cycling. He's retired, he used to cycle blah blah blah. At this point I wish I'd just cycled off.

He started telling me about how he's retired and talking about his military and prison officer career but it at a certain point it was as though a switch had flipped and his monologue turned into him raging about immigration; I cannot put into words how angry he was and I though I don't want to admit it started to feel scared and intimidated.  

It's common knowledge that many are unhappy with the levels of immigration, that honestly was not the issue. It's the way he was almost shouting, bright red, blocking my path and just the pure rage. I'd said nothing to lead onto this topic- I'm not an idiot and I'm wary because of past encounters and even an attack. As he finally stormed off he was shouting about a bloody uprising, how I'd see, it would be an armed revolution etc.  
  
I've nothing else to say except how upset I am and I want to get it off my chest. I'm so tired in my life of being confronted by these old angry men. It's about once a week and I don't even cycle every day at the moment. I've no idea why but older men do not just leve me alone when I'm cycling, I'm consistently harassed by them. It's as though they see a woman on a bike and they feel that's their cue to BOTHER you. I spent Boxing Day shaken up and I still am. Thanks angry old man.

1hnczju,https://www.reddit.com/r/LifeAdvice/comments/1hnczju/it_all_feels_overwhelming/,It all feels overwhelming 🫠,"TL;DR — mid 30s, no savings, husband unemployed, ready to start a family.. lost and sad.

I don’t know how to progress in life and it feels so overwhelming, it’s almost easier to avoid it all together. I’m sorry this is long - I don’t think I’ve ever written these feelings down or shared them with anyone besides my husband.. and it all just came pouring out of me at 5am 🥺

I’m 35, married to my best friend for 8 years and pretty proud of the life we built from 20-30 years old. We graduated college, moved from FL to NYC where I got my masters degree. We worked in our chosen industries (the high end camera industry - I traveled as a marketing rep for the largest camera retailer and my husband was a cine tech specialist for motion pictures. We left due to high rent demand and miserable winters). We ended up buying/converting an airstream and traveling the country for two years, with our pets. I taught photography classes from the airstream. Then covid hit and those dreams crashed and burned.

I did things I’m proud of, but I never took the next steps seriously. And now I feel like I’m exactly where I was at 22 but now with crippling anxiety, no motivation and nothing to show for the last 15 years besides coffee table books for our trips.

My husband has been unemployed for 14 months, though not for a lack of trying. My degree in Communications and master degree in Digital Photography earned me my own business that is failing because of my own insecurities and imposter syndrome. I’m quite good at what I do (adventurous elopements) and can’t even find the ambition to post on social or update my website. So I work from home, in marketing and make $47k yearly. We keep our heads afloat with extra photography bookings (it was a decent year but I only have one event booked for next year) and keeping our expenses low. We live in what was my grandmothers home so we don’t have exorbitant rent prices. But there’s no way we can afford the new roof it needs or the basic updates to make it sustainable. We are able to just get by and that small comfort has become the norm.. desensitizing us to the weight of reality.

We cannot sell the airstream. We, along with my insanely supportive parents, spent close to 40k on the renovations. It looks like trash. The first renovator did marginal work and made us do everything from laying the floor to cutting aluminum to fix the siding. The second renovator used a plasma torch on the airstream and got frustrated and forced us out on the street. We ended up brining it to my parents backyard where the last renovator didn’t even measure his drill bits and ended up punching through the interior AND exterior walls all over the airstream so it leaks and lost an insane amount of value (it’s a 1972 30’ airstream ambassador). The last renovator used an electric torque wrench to put on our wheels and it snapped the bolts when we were on the road and the damage it caused will need another 10k to repair the body. The inside was never even finished. 40k and we didn’t even have working plumbing. It’s been in storage since 2019. Listed it for as low at 15k and never got a bite.

I’m terrified of the doctor. I feel like a fucking child saying this. But I cry and almost pass out when around needles. I have no other irrational fears but omg I cannot control my childish reaction to needles and it’s embarrassing. It’s lead me to avoid doctors for way too long. I need to see a OBGYN because I’m sure I have endometriosis. I’m in pain all the time. Miserable for two weeks every month. But I’ll find any excuse in the book not to take my health seriously. I’ve stopped working out and can’t motivate myself to do much besides attend a few aerobic dance classes a month. I feel, and see, the weight starting to pile on.

Ny husband desperately needs therapy, too. But damn that’s a scary thought sometimes and we’ve let ourselves avoid it. He lost his dad suddenly when he was 14 and lost his brother unexpectedly when he was 26. He never recovered and this lapse in his career has made him feel so unvalued and low.

I’m ready to start a family but I’m 36. I’m an “elder millennial” and terrified of needles. My anxiety can’t even comprehend a “geriatric pregnancy” and all the health concerns and blood draws that would be required. I can literally feel my body going cold and weak just writing about blood draws. But god knows we don’t have any savings and adoption feels impossible. But I’m adopted. I’d love to adopt. But who would pick the two struggling artists types in their mid 30s with one income? How would we afford such a luxury?

My husband has decided to switch gears and apply for a degree and accreditation as an X-ray tech but the program starts in January and he of course isn’t prepared (pre-reqs) so we have to wait another year. Then it’s two years in the program. So maybe in 3-4 years from now our finances will look different? But then I’m 40. FORTY. I blinked and it’s gone. And I don’t have a savings account, a family of my own or any motivation to make the changes I know I deserve.

I know I need therapy.
Reddit shouldn’t be the only place I’m able to say all this.

But it’s a scary world sometimes. And there’s a line from Hamilton that echos in my mind.. “the moments when you’re in so deep, it feels easier to just swim down”.

I lost the surface.

I just got a Vertuo machine, and I’m obsessed! ❤️ I’ve never been super into coffee, but after trying it at a Nespresso store, I couldn’t resist getting one for myself.

Now I’m looking for capsule recommendations because I have no idea where to start. I like coffee that’s soft and a little sweet, and I enjoy trying different flavors. I don’t add sugar, so I usually go for something naturally mellow.

Most of the time, I drink my coffee with milk, but I enjoy a good espresso now and then. For reference, I *loved* the Pumpkin Spice capsule they had recently, but I wasn’t a fan of the new Almond flavor.

What are your go-to capsules? I’d love to hear your favorites and have some suggestions!",1,1735298108.0,nespresso,2,1.0,False

I (28) moved to Colorado 4 years ago. But my sister and I have had an estranged relationship. She was in an abusive relationship for the last 6 years and she left him earlier this year and now has a new partner that she lives with. They have been together about 8 months now.

It’s taken a while for my sister and I to regain trust and bond but after her asking me I last minute bought a flight to come and visit her. She had every single day planned and I’m not going to lie, it sounded overwhelming at first but I was trying to be a good sport about it. It’s supposed to be a short trip (3 days) but once I got here she’s basically been ignoring me. I landed last night and when I arrived to her apartment she was making dinner. I washed up and offered to help but she told me to just go sit down. After dinner she went to bed immediately.

Today, I woke up early but since they weren’t awake I walked to a local coffee shop and let my sister know that I was out. She told me the name of some of her favorite coffee shops and I checked on of them out. I came back and texted and called my sister multiple times to let me in her building & she didn’t respond for an hour. I went to go walk to a different local spot and waited for her to wake up when she called me back and told me she didn’t see her phone. I came back & we went to a museum. Even while at the museum she didn’t really make an effort to talk with me. I’m not sure if it’s because her boyfriend is constantly around or what. He kept checking in with me to make sure I was having a good time but that’s the max communication I’ve gotten. When we got back from out 3 hours at the museum she told me that I “didn’t have to hang out with them & could just go in my room”. I said no and hung out for a bit but she just played music the whole time. Then at 6pm she was tired and that she and her boyfriend were going to take an hour nap. Well that 1 hour turned into 6 hours and they woke up when I was ready for bed (11pm).

I’m having a hard time sleeping but I figured I’d fall asleep eventually. It’s now 3am and my sister and her boyfriend invited friends over and they are all talking at full volume & idk what to do. I’m annoyed bc I really didn’t want to come here but I wanted to get a chance to mend my relationship with her. I feel like she’s annoyed that I’m here but also she’s never not standing next to a friend or her boyfriend so maybe she’s just not free to talk? Idk smh.

A few things I want to share:

•Out of Words- I no longer use the phrases such as ""You know what I mean"" Instead I have the words to convey anything i want, be it emotions, ideas or thoughts though I thwart myself from sharing *everything* which comes into my mind :|

•Self Help Books- I dont why some people look down upon this genre as if it is the Adipurush of books.
However, I believe that this is the most effective approach to personal growth, atleast better than watching those podcasts by Beer Biceps or Sandeep Maheshwari.
 Ryan Holiday has never disappointed me tbh.

•Nationalism-  If films such as URI and Shershaah moved you deeply, I would suggest exploring the works of Rachna Bisht and Lt. Gen. KJS to know how many lives have been laid down for what we have today. Many unsung heroes, like Captain Vikram Batra, deserve recognition.

I'm 35F, single 

my Female friend is 32, and she's been dating a 41Yr old man for 6 months now.  Officially dating, they have been friends for longer.  

They get along great,  they are both responsible,  individually have their careers,  achievements,  stability,  and yet somehow are even better together.  

They bring out the best of eachother and I'm so happy for her.  She is the sweetest girl and deserves the world,  which this guy is giving her ❤️ 

My question is,   I've noticed my bestie staring at her bf. When he talks or laughs,  or is just sitting watching a movie, she looks over at him of often with a small smirk on her face.  Almost like she can't control smiling.  

Last night they both joined me for dinner party, and we had gifts.  She watched this man intently,  smiling at him unwrapping a gift. It was a bluetooth beanie she got him because he enjoys running outside.  It wasn't THAT exciting,  but  She looks at him with stars in her eyes,  with such intense admiration. 

I've never seen this look from her before. 

 I notice he has picked up on helping comfort her anxiety, she had a rough relationship years prior and is still healing.  

I'm really happy for her and everything but the staring she does,  watching her bf do things like make her coffee, or bring her a snack,  she smiles far too much that is weird to me.  

She has no mental health issues,  other than anxiety.  She's intelligent overall,  works at a law firm as an office clerk composing wills and documentation. 
Her smiling,  the way she was acting is like she watching the famous hottie Chris Pratt walking her way, she's star struck over this average looking gamer guy who brings her coffee....  lol 

I let her know her actions make me feel uncomfortable to be around her,  bec her smiling is unnecessary and strange.  

I get she's happy but he's bringing her coffee, like it's not like it's a proposal, or a ticket to LA. 

I don't know why she stated at her bf so much,  but i let her know how it made ME feel.  My friend of 9 years is now ignoring me,  telling me I'm a jerk because I'm making a big deal over nothing.  It's a big deal to me,  because I'm genuinely uncomfortable. 

AITA?

1hncppf,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1hncppf/how_people_have_time_to_do_it_all_long_post/,How people have time to do it all (Long post),"Time is tricky. It’s both valuable and slippery, and many people struggle with carving out time for what they care about.

You’re also not going to feel good about yourself If you know or see someone who seems to do it all.

I want to show you how those people do it, and how the answers are much more underwhelming and accessible than you might think.

(The person you know/admire may do some or all of these things, but these are the patterns I have noticed)

**They spend less time on more things:**

It doesn’t take much to cross the beginner stage and impress people. If you spend 20 to 30 minutes on something three times a week and keep at it for a couple of years, people will think you’re decent at it.

This means you can spend one hour on three things, three times a week, and be seen as decent in all of them by most people.

Meanwhile, someone else spends one hour on one thing and only earns one trophy. The diminishing returns of expertise don’t help much either.

The illusion comes from this: because you’re not an expert in the hobbies of the person you admire, you assume they are more competent than they are and therefore you make the conclusion that they must have had more time.

In reality, they spend less time on more things.

(In some cases, they are competent as you deem them to be, but they also spent 5 years' worth of effort on it spread out over 10.)

**They had years of practice:**

This is really important to understand. Being able to maintain a habit, hobby, or side project that takes 10 to 30 minutes a day in its maintenance phase probably took years of messy, unproductive trial and error.

Any project demands an order of magnitude more time and resources at the start than in its maintenance phase.

Sure, it only takes them a short amount of time now, but it didn’t before, now they have efficient systems in place.

If you have 5 to 10 years and you want to be good at 3 to 5 things, you can start with one thing and reach its maintenance stage in a year or two. Then you add the second thing, and so on.

Before you know it, you’ll be a “master of time management.” where you can do all these things without breaking a sweat, and someone looking from the outside won’t understand how you perform that way.

**They delegate/automate:**

If you can spend one to two hours automating something you’ll never have to think about again, like bill payments or subscriptions, why not set it up?

You can get groceries delivered and drastically reduce your trips to the store. Keep a list of the items you care about and get those yourself, but let someone else handle the rest.

Also, get a roomba!

If you think this is too much, you’re right, it is. But people have sacrificed even more. They hire nannies, virtual assistants, and services of all kinds. What I suggested is just the tip of the iceberg.

If someone seems to be “doing it all,” maybe they’re doing one or two things they care about and is visible to the masses while delegating or automating the invisible, less impactful tasks. It’s more common than you think.

**They had minimal starting conditions**

Let’s say you want to write, draw, learn a language, or lose weight. Chances are you’ve set conditions that you think are “reasonable” for starting.

For many productive people, the starting conditions are much simpler (and sometimes dirtier). Most of our conditions are luxuries in disguise.

You may want a quiet place to write; they started writing on their phone while on the subway. You may need decent materials to draw; they used a regular notebook during lunch breaks.

At first, these setups are sneaky, messy, and barely functional. You’ll question if they’re even worth it.

But that’s only the case in the beginning. Over time, the process becomes more convenient, but that convenience only comes after starting under unfavorable conditions.

**They cared more than the pain**

This isn’t a motivational post. It’s about the basics of how the human mind makes a decision. Caring isn’t enough, you need to care more than the cost of the action.

Are you okay with spending money you don’t have to automate something you think is a luxury, just to carve out enough time to do something small and “pathetic”?

For some, the answer is yes. You need to care enough to tolerate the cost. Not everyone has that clarity or drive, but it’s important to view the person you admire within the context of their life, not yours.

This is not to paint their motivation in a good light, sometimes it’s healthy, other times it’s not, because they may dread or deeply dislike the situation so much that the pain of change pales in comparison.

If you were running for your life because a bear was chasing you, you wouldn’t care much about how tiresome running is, right?

**They follow a structure, sometimes blindly:**

I don’t want to talk too much about this but the general idea is this: the person knows exactly what to do and when to do it. For example, piano practice for 30 minutes at 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That’s it.

The focus isn’t necessarily on how well they perform during the practice, it’s about going through the motions. Simply having a clearly defined routine cuts out so much of the guesswork and friction that can derail action. The simpler the structure, the better.

Motivation and discipline will always fluctuate, but the brain thrives on routines and cues. A solid routine provides stability and consistency, even when your willpower is low.

Think about how much of a hassle walking would be if you had to consciously plan every movement. Sometimes, blindly following a set routine works in your favor.

**They're not that good at managing their time:**

This might seem weird, but many people who seem to do it all, don’t really do it all, sometimes they’re procrastinating in a different way than you do.

A common example that you may relate to is procrastinating on the work you need to do by doing work that is more appealing.

The same principle applies here, Maybe they’re neglecting crucial areas for others, maybe that's their way of coping with their emotions.

Everyone procrastinates, maybe not in the same way and to the same extent that you do it, but everyone does it in some way.

**Energy matters more than you think**

You can cut down a lot of effort just by eating right, sleeping right, and exercising right. Ask the person you admire what their energy levels are like.

Low energy is insidious. You might take twice the time to finish a task, only to realize it didn’t need to be done at all. Your priorities can become a mess, your patience gets halved, and your ability to learn, think, or articulate becomes impaired, you also need twice the amount of time to rest and catch up. A cup of coffee won’t fix all that.

Time management is rarely just about time. Energy always plays a role. You don’t have to take my word for it, just think about how much you got done on a day you felt rested. How pleasant was the experience? How “locked in” were you?

Your best day is some people’s default state.

That's it, that’s the underwhelming trick.

A good day where you sleep well, eat well, delegate the things you hate, and focus on the things you enjoy suddenly feels incredibly productive and you end the day motivated for the next.

He was making fun of Nellie's gift and Carolyn wondered if Laura was a little envious of the money they had, only natural.  She wasn't but maybe Caroline was that she could do that ridiculous thing. Caroline said it was ""Harriet's way"" and when Charles said he'd never do that, she said  ""There's no danger of us spoiling our children with lavish gifts"" She didn't say they were ""poor"" but did call him the"" Mill Tycoon"" half in jest when he said wheel was coming and they would be doing very well. Of course this was before he broke his ribs from the same wheel and she had to go work at restaurant. Big sigh for her I'm sure.

He finally did give her rest in the end, we see a tiny glimpse of their life, no kids, but just all the things in their place and stuff they could do now and Caroline dressed to the nines. I'm just sad she couldn't have a little in WG. My only complaint of the show is when he did have a good year, it was taken from him another way for 10 years. Fans wouldn't mind a good year or season and have them concentrate on someone else's tragedy a little more instead or just a lighter tragedy.

Have you ever wondered how Caroline felt always having to count pennies and have credit and hope her eggs covered some coffee.",3,1735297806.0,littlehouseonprairie,3,1.0,False
1hncp9m,https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/1hncp9m/how_people_have_time_to_do_it_all_long_post/,How people have time to do it all (Long post),"Time is tricky. It’s both valuable and slippery, and many people struggle with carving out time for what they care about.

You’re also not going to feel good about yourself If you know or see someone who seems to do it all.

I want to show you how those people do it, and how the answers are much more underwhelming and accessible than you might think.

(The person you know/admire may do some or all of these things, but these are the patterns I have noticed)

**They spend less time on more things:**

It doesn’t take much to cross the beginner stage and impress people. If you spend 20 to 30 minutes on something three times a week and keep at it for a couple of years, people will think you’re decent at it.

This means you can spend one hour on three things, three times a week, and be seen as decent in all of them by most people.

Meanwhile, someone else spends one hour on one thing and only earns one trophy. The diminishing returns of expertise don’t help much either.

The illusion comes from this: because you’re not an expert in the hobbies of the person you admire, you assume they are more competent than they are and therefore you make the conclusion that they must have had more time. 

In reality, they spend less time on more things. 

(In some cases, they are competent as you deem them to be, but they also spent 5 years' worth of effort on it spread out over 10.)

**They had years of practice:**

This is really important to understand. Being able to maintain a habit, hobby, or side project that takes 10 to 30 minutes a day in its maintenance phase probably took years of messy, unproductive trial and error.

Any project demands an order of magnitude more time and resources at the start than in its maintenance phase.

Sure, it only takes them a short amount of time now, but it didn’t before, now they have efficient systems in place.

If you have 5 to 10 years and you want to be good at 3 to 5 things, you can start with one thing and reach its maintenance stage in a year or two. Then you add the second thing, and so on.

Before you know it, you’ll be a “master of time management.” where you can do all these things without breaking a sweat, and someone looking from the outside won’t understand how you perform that way.

**They delegate/automate:**

If you can spend one to two hours automating something you’ll never have to think about again, like bill payments or subscriptions, why not set it up?

You can get groceries delivered and drastically reduce your trips to the store. Keep a list of the items you care about and get those yourself, but let someone else handle the rest.

Also, get a roomba!

If you think this is too much, you’re right, it is. But people have sacrificed even more. They hire nannies, virtual assistants, and services of all kinds. What I suggested is just the tip of the iceberg.

If someone seems to be “doing it all,” maybe they’re doing one or two things they care about and is visible to the masses while delegating or automating the invisible, less impactful tasks. It’s more common than you think.

**They had minimal starting conditions**

Let’s say you want to write, draw, learn a language, or lose weight. Chances are you’ve set conditions that you think are “reasonable” for starting.

For many productive people, the starting conditions are much simpler (and sometimes dirtier). Most of our conditions are luxuries in disguise.

You may want a quiet place to write; they started writing on their phone while on the subway. You may need decent materials to draw; they used a regular notebook during lunch breaks.

At first, these setups are sneaky, messy, and barely functional. You’ll question if they’re even worth it.

But that’s only the case in the beginning. Over time, the process becomes more convenient, but that convenience only comes after starting under unfavorable conditions.

**They cared more than the pain**

This isn’t a motivational post. It’s about the basics of how the human mind makes a decision. Caring isn’t enough, you need to care more than the cost of the action.

Are you okay with spending money you don’t have to automate something you think is a luxury, just to carve out enough time to do something small and “pathetic”?

For some, the answer is yes. You need to care enough to tolerate the cost. Not everyone has that clarity or drive, but it’s important to view the person you admire within the context of their life, not yours.

This is not to paint their motivation in a good light, sometimes it’s healthy, other times it’s not, because they may dread or deeply dislike the situation so much that the pain of change pales in comparison.

If you were running for your life because a bear was chasing you, you wouldn’t care much about how tiresome running is, right?

**They follow a structure, sometimes blindly:**

I don’t want to talk too much about this but the general idea is this: the person knows exactly what to do and when to do it. For example, piano practice for 30 minutes at 8 p.m. on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. That’s it.

The focus isn’t necessarily on how well they perform during the practice, it’s about going through the motions. Simply having a clearly defined routine cuts out so much of the guesswork and friction that can derail action. The simpler the structure, the better.

Motivation and discipline will always fluctuate, but the brain thrives on routines and cues. A solid routine provides stability and consistency, even when your willpower is low.

Think about how much of a hassle walking would be if you had to consciously plan every movement. Sometimes, blindly following a set routine works in your favor.

**They're not that good at managing their time:**

This might seem weird, but many people who seem to do it all, don’t really do it all, sometimes they’re procrastinating in a different way than you do.

A common example that you may relate to is procrastinating on the work you need to do by doing work that is more appealing.

The same principle applies here, Maybe they’re neglecting crucial areas for others, maybe that's their way of coping with their emotions.

Everyone procrastinates, maybe not in the same way and to the same extent that you do it, but everyone does it in some way.

**Energy matters more than you think**

You can cut down a lot of effort just by eating right, sleeping right, and exercising right. Ask the person you admire what their energy levels are like.

Low energy is insidious. You might take twice the time to finish a task, only to realize it didn’t need to be done at all. Your priorities can become a mess, your patience gets halved, and your ability to learn, think, or articulate becomes impaired, you also need twice the amount of time to rest and catch up. A cup of coffee won’t fix all that.

Time management is rarely just about time. Energy always plays a role. You don’t have to take my word for it, just think about how much you got done on a day you felt rested. How pleasant was the experience? How “locked in” were you?

Your best day is some people’s default state.

That's it, that’s the underwhelming trick. 

A good day where you sleep well, eat well, delegate the things you hate, and focus on the things you enjoy suddenly feels incredibly productive and you end the day motivated for the next.

There is two major things I am so far unable to fix:

1. lid angle sensor 
The water ran over the lid angle sensor and the associated connector socket. The MacBooks screen would turn on only for a second and then turn off again. If the lid angle sensor is connected also the keyboard and trackpad aren’t working. I’ve cleaned the sensor in an Isopropanol solution in a ultra sonic cleaner and the cleaned the socket with a little brush and the same solution. However, the issue persisted. I got a new calibrated sensor but connecting this one produces the same issue. I have disconnected it for now but a solution would be awesome. 

2. keyboard 
A few keys are not working anymore (enter,5,t,g,b) - I am super reluctant to buy a new top cover or trying to replace the keyboard. Is there any way to fix this from the outside? Can this be cleaned somehow?

With the right [home furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture), you can maximize your space while maintaining a chic and functional aesthetic. From [modern furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) that blends sleek design with utility to eco-friendly [natural furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) and [contemporary furniture](https://www.homeandsouldubai.com/furniture) with multifunctional features, here are some of the best ideas to make the most of your compact living space.

# 1. Multifunctional Furniture for Dual Purposes

Investing in **modern furniture** with multifunctional designs can save both space and money. Look for pieces like:

* **Sofa Beds:** A stylish sofa that converts into a bed is perfect for small living rooms or guest spaces.
* **Storage Ottomans:** These double as seating or coffee tables while providing hidden storage.
* **Lift-Top Coffee Tables:** These tables offer storage underneath and a raised surface for dining or working.

Multifunctional furniture adds versatility to your space without compromising on style.

# 2. Foldable and Expandable Designs

When space is limited, foldable and expandable furniture is a game-changer:

* **Wall-Mounted Desks:** Perfect for creating a home office in tight spaces, these desks can be folded away when not in use.
* **Drop-Leaf Dining Tables:** These tables can be expanded for meals and folded down to save space when not in use.
* **Expandable Beds:** Adjustable beds allow you to maximize sleeping areas without taking up unnecessary space.

These options are ideal for anyone seeking **contemporary furniture** solutions that prioritize functionality.

# 3. Vertical Storage Solutions

Maximize your vertical space with tall, narrow furniture:

* **Bookshelves with Cabinets:** Combine open shelving with closed storage to keep clutter at bay.
* **Murphy Beds:** These fold into the wall, freeing up floor space during the day.
* **Hanging Racks and Hooks:** Utilize walls for hanging pots, pans, or even bicycles, keeping floors clear.

**Modern furniture** often incorporates sleek, vertical designs that optimize storage without overwhelming the room.

# 4. Natural Furniture for Small Spaces

If you love sustainable options, consider **natural furniture** that’s lightweight and compact:

* **Rattan Chairs:** These are not only stylish but also easy to move and perfect for small living spaces.
* **Bamboo Shelves:** These shelves are eco-friendly, durable, and perfect for displaying decor without taking up too much room.
* **Compact Wooden Tables:** Opt for smaller, natural wood tables with clean lines to add warmth and functionality to your home.

Natural materials give small homes a cozy and inviting feel while promoting sustainability.

# 5. Built-In and Custom Furniture

Custom or built-in furniture can be tailored to your exact needs and dimensions:

* **Built-In Seating with Storage:** Benches with storage underneath are perfect for dining areas or bay windows.
* **Custom Closets:** These maximize storage by utilizing every inch of available space.
* **Integrated Beds with Shelving:** Combine a bed with storage or display units to create a compact yet functional sleeping area.

While this may require an upfront investment, the results are perfect for those who appreciate **contemporary furniture** that fits seamlessly into their home.

# 6. Compact Furniture for Every Room

# Living Room:

* Opt for a sleek sectional sofa with a chaise that includes hidden storage.
* Choose a nesting coffee table set that can be tucked away when not in use.
* Use floating shelves for decor and books, freeing up floor space.

# Bedroom:

* Look for beds with built-in drawers or under-bed storage solutions.
* Use a vertical wardrobe instead of a traditional dresser to save space.
* Add a small wall-mounted nightstand for essential items.

# Dining Area:

* A round table takes up less space than rectangular designs.
* Use stackable or foldable chairs that can be stored when not in use.
* Look for **modern furniture** that combines dining tables with shelving units for dual functionality.

# Home Office:

* Use a compact desk with built-in storage for a tidy workspace.
* Incorporate a fold-out or wall-mounted desk for a minimalist look.
* Consider ergonomic yet space-saving chairs that blend style with comfort.

# 7. Open Up the Room with Smart Design

Make your small home feel bigger with these design tips:

* **Light Colors:** Choose **home furniture** in lighter shades to create an airy, spacious vibe.
* **Mirrors:** Reflect light and create the illusion of a larger space with strategically placed mirrors.
* **Minimalist Design:** Stick to clean lines and uncluttered **contemporary furniture** to avoid overwhelming the room.

# 8. Where to Find Space-Saving Furniture in Dubai

Dubai offers a wide variety of options when it comes to stylish and functional **home furniture**. From eco-friendly **natural furniture** to innovative **modern furniture** designs, you can find pieces that fit your space and style perfectly. Look for stores or online platforms specializing in **contemporary furniture** to explore versatile options that meet the needs of small homes.

# Final Thoughts

Why?,"I recently started a new job where I 23F met my friend 27M. We became friends within about a month of me working at the company. He had expressed that he was trying to find a new job in his chosen field (trade work) but it's hard for him to find work as he is an immigrant. I let him know that I have friends in his chosen industry and I could help him find a job. We worked together to fix up his resume and hung out for a bit after. After this he was very thankful and we started getting closer. Texting more, trying to line up our shifts at work. Last week he came to see me while I was staying at a hotel and we had a few drinks. I am currently going through a divorce with my husband 25M and he has been a shoulder for me. We were laughing, learning more about each other, and I can't tell but I feel like he was being a little flirty (which I am very okay with). He had mentioned how if we were from the same culture that he would think of me as a potential partner, how he will always be here for me, and that he really wants to introduce me to his friends. Safe to say that after this night I definitely may have developed some feelings. Flash forward to christmas eve and I am sick with the flu. He sees me leaving work and we share just a brief greeting as I am desperate to get home. He texts me to see if I was okay and we chat just for a bit before I fall asleep. Around 3am I am woken up to drunk texts from him saying that he wants to see me and that he would like to come over in the morning. I say no because I am sick and the house is a bit of a mess, but I do offer to bring him coffee in the morning if I am feeling better. He had been drinking and he ends up wanting to come see me right away. He keeps saying how he feels bad that I am sick and alone on Christmas and he wants to come over. Again, I say maybe not even though I did really want to see him. We talk some more and he brings up again how he wants me to meet his friends and how he can come be with me. The last thing I said was that I'm okay with being alone but I liked talking to him and he could keep me company over the phone. He didn't respond because he had fallen asleep. Later on christmas morning he said that he and his roommates had made a lot of food and he just thought he would bring me some. I said thank you for the thought and that I do wish I could have seen how drunk he was in person the night before. He left me on delivered all day. In the evening I asked if he had any NYE plans and that he should come over. He said he would but his responses were very minimal which was odd. He then asked if he should invite our mutual friend which is also weird because he's never asked if we should invite someone else with us. This kinda made me upset because I was just hoping it would only be us so I could see what my feelings for him are. Part of me thinks that he either knows I have feelings and he is uncomfortable with that, or maybe he feels like he crossed a boundary (which he didn't). But his response to me when he woke up made me feel like he may have regretted some of his drunken texts. Am I thinking to much on this because I have a crush or is it weird that he suddenly changed the narrative and he doesn't seem to talkative and doesn't want to hang out just the 2 of us? It's now the morning of the 27th and he hasn't answered my text and he barely spoke to me at work. I feel like he's ignoring me. How can I approach the ""are we good?"" talk without spooking him off?

1hnclve,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1hnclve/aita_for_leaving_my_friends_stranded_during_a/,AITA for leaving my friends stranded during a road trip after they repeatedly disrespected my boundaries?,"So, here’s the story: My partner and I are currently traveling in Australia, and her best friend and her partner came to visit us for a 4-week trip. To make things smooth, I planned almost everything—accommodations, a rental car, a suggested route for Christmas in Sydney and New Year’s in Byron Bay, plus interesting stops along the way. My partner and I were also the only registered drivers for the rental.

From the start, things felt a bit off. For example, on our first long drive, we went to see the Penguin Parade on Phillip Island. We arrived early, but the penguins weren’t expected until 9 PM, and our accommodation was 2.5 hours away. I suggested we skip the event because I didn’t want to drive unfamiliar roads at night, but they insisted on staying. I even offered a compromise—a wildlife tour earlier in the day—which they enjoyed. Still, they wanted dinner afterward, which meant I had to drive in the dark, alone, over bad Australian roads until 11 PM.

When we finally arrived at the accommodation, they walked straight into the master bedroom without a word and said goodnight. My partner and I ended up in the kids’ room.

This set the tone for the trip. They didn’t offer to chip in for gas or ask if we needed anything from rest stops unless I explicitly said something. At one point, they wanted to take a 2.5-hour detour on an already 7-hour drive. I pushed back, which led to a tense discussion about “empathy vs. sympathy” (???). Which was ridiculous.

I got sick a few days later but still drove 6 hours while they slept comfortably in the back. At the next place, they again took the master bedroom without asking. I finally said, “Hey, next stop, let’s trade rooms.” The response was snippy, which pushed me over the edge. I was sick, exhausted, and done with being treated like a chauffeur/host without consideration.

The breaking point came when I booked another accommodation for myself and my partner and left them at the current place. I didn’t explain much beyond, “I need a proper bed to recover.” They were left without a car in a remote area and later texted, saying what I did was unfair.

They apologized for not being more mindful but also pointed out things like bringing me coffee once and offering to drive (which I don’t recall happening). They also said I should’ve talked things out instead of “abandoning” them.

From my perspective, I tried to accommodate them for days, but I hit my limit. I needed to prioritize myself for once, especially when I was sick.

So, Reddit, AITA?

Edit: my so is very supportive although a bit torn between the lines understandably

I didn’t leave them at a gas station, more like a Resort and already booked House, 10min to the next city by car. 1min from the beach lol

I have lived extensively in Mumbai and Hyderabad, and visited other cities like Delhi, Chennai and Pune umpteen number of times, and have consciously decided to make my permanent based in Bangalore (hopefully). Honestly there's no better city to live in India. 

Traffic is bad, but have you travelled in Mumbai for example? Have you gone from Malad East to West, or is your office in Chakala or BKC for example? Have you ever experienced traffic in Mumbai when it rains? Or god forbid when one local train line is closed for maintenance? 

Infrastructure is bad, but have you seen Gurgaon's infrastructure (not delhi)? 

Is there any city in India which has a 300 acre park right in the middle of the city? Have you seen tree lined roads in any other city , like you see in Indiranagar, Koramangala, HSR, Jaynagar,  Malleshwaram, JP Nagar, Baswangudi or the whole of central Bangalore. In Hyderabad you will have to travel for at least 4-5kms to reach a half decent garden.

Is there any other city offers so many  cheap, super hygienic, good quality breakfast/lunch/dinner options? Even fine dining restaurants or microbreweries are priced 50% lower as compared to Delhi and Mumbai.

Which city can give you comfort of sitting alone in a restaurant, bar or a coffee shop with no one else judging you? 

Which city has more adventure/outdoor clubs or other activities like badminton or football?

There are more road rage incidents in Mumbai these days than Bangalore. Less said about Delhi, the better.

Even the overall experience of coming out of Airport, and finding a cab is the most seamless in Bangalore.

Safety, especially during the night, depends on the area you are in, like every other city. In NCR, no area feels safe. 


Weather and pollution are two topics where there's general consensus. And yes these are probably the two most important factors governing the quality of your life.

To all those people complaining, try living in areas other than Bellandur, marathalli or Sarjapur road or at least try exploring more. And if Bangalore is your first big city experience, and you hate it, believe me you have it much better than folks living in other cities. It is what it is.

----------------------------------------------------------

Black decor into your living space can elevate your design, offering a touch of modern sophistication and style. Black is versatile and can blend seamlessly with various colors and materials. If you’re wondering how to creatively use black decor for a modern look, explore these engaging ideas.

### Bold Accent Walls

One of the most striking ways to use black decor is through accent walls. A deep black wall can create a focal point in any room, making it feel more sophisticated. Consider using matte black paint or wallpaper with geometric patterns to enhance depth and texture. Pairing a black wall with lighter furniture pieces, such as a white sofa or wooden accents, helps create a balanced, airy feel.

### Statement Furniture Pieces

Incorporate black furniture into your home design to make a bold statement. Here are a few ways to consider:

- **Chairs:** Opt for sleek black chairs with modern lines. Think about lounge chairs or dining chairs that can act as show-stopping features.
- **Tables:** A black coffee table or dining table adds drama and can serve as the centerpiece of a room.
- **Sofas:** A black sectional or velvet couch gives a luxurious feel and pairs wonderfully with colorful throw pillows.

### Layering Textures

Using different fabrics and materials can bring your black decor to life. Consider mixing leather, velvet, and matte finishes to create a rich tapestry of textures. For example, combine a black leather chair with plush velvet pillows. This layering will introduce an inviting yet chic atmosphere to your space.

### Eye-Catching Lighting

Light fixtures are essential when working with black decor. Whether it’s black pendant lights, stylish floor lamps, or unique sconces, the right lighting can enhance your modern look. Black lighting fixtures can make a bold statement while providing illumination. For an added effect, opt for fixtures that have gold or brass accents to create a perfect contrast.

### Art and Accessories

Utilizing art pieces and accessories can be a fantastic way to introduce black decor. Large black frames around art pieces serve as a striking contrast against lighter walls. Consider abstract black-and-white art or photography for a contemporary vibe. Additionally, decorative vases, sculptures, and candles in black can add flair without overwhelming your space.

### Mixing with Colors

One of the best parts about using black decor is its versatility with other colors. You can create stunning combinations using the following tips:

- **White:** Create a timeless look with black and white, offering an elegant and sleek aesthetic.
- **Metallics:** Pairing black with gold, silver, or copper introduces glamour and enhances a modern feel.
- **Bold Colors:** Use black as a grounding element with vibrant colors like coral, teal, or mustard to make those colors pop.

### Functional Black Decor Items

Think about practical items that also offer style. Black decor can be functional and design-focused. Consider the following:

- **Storage Solutions:** Black bookshelves or cabinets can blend seamlessly into your design while providing necessary storage.
- **Rugs:** A black area rug can define spaces and add warmth without taking away from other decor elements.
- **Kitchenware:** Black pots, pans, and tableware can enrich your kitchen’s overall aesthetic.

### Use of Mirrors

Mirrors with black frames can create an illusion of space while reflecting light. This is especially useful in smaller rooms, making them feel larger while incorporating your theme naturally. Consider arranging multiple black-framed mirrors in a gallery style for added visual interest.

Using black decor for a modern look doesn’t have to be daunting. By applying these creative strategies, you can achieve a sophisticated and contemporary environment that reflects your personal style. Whether it's through bold walls, statement furniture, or textured accents, the right elements can transform your space into a haven of modern elegance.

The Psychological Impact of Using Black in Modern Interior Design
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Using black in modern interior design is not just about aesthetic appeal; it also has significant psychological effects that can influence our feelings and behaviors within our spaces. The color black can evoke a range of emotions and create different atmospheres depending on how it's applied. Here, we delve into the psychological implications of incorporating black decor in your home or office.

### The Power of Black

Black is often viewed as a powerful and sophisticated color. Here are some psychological impacts of using black in your space:

- **Authority and Strength:** Black is commonly associated with power and authority. This can create an environment that feels strong and stable, making it perfect for offices or study areas where focus is needed.
- **Elegance and Luxury:** Many luxury brands utilize black in their branding and product design. Using black in decor can thus elevate the perceived value of your space and give it a modern, chic appearance.
- **Depth and Sophistication:** Black adds depth to a room, which can make it feel both inviting and cozy. This added depth creates a sense of sophistication that can be incredibly appealing.

### Balancing Black with Light

While black can offer numerous benefits, it’s important to find balance. Too much black may lead to feelings of confinement or heaviness. Here are ways to balance black decor:

- **Incorporate Natural Light:** Maximizing natural light helps lift the mood and offsets the potential heaviness of black walls or furnishings. Large windows and mirrors can reflect light, making the space feel more open.
- **Use Contrasting Colors:** Pair black with vibrant colors or soft neutrals. Bright colors evoke energy, while softer tones can create a calming effect. This combination can lead to a balanced and dynamic space.
- **Add Textured Elements:** Introducing various textures can break the uniformity of black surfaces and invite warmth into the environment. Textured fabrics, wood grains, or metallic accents work well to soften the space.

### Creating Mood and Ambiance

The use of black can significantly alter the mood of a room. Depending on how you use it, black can create either an intimate atmosphere or a vibrant, modern look. Consider these points:

Check the Details Here -&gt; ;) https://amzn.to/3Bwu5mR  
  
- **Intimacy:** Smaller spaces with black decor can feel intimate and cozy, ideal for bedrooms or reading nooks. Use soft lighting to enhance the closeness of the space.
- **Drama and Boldness:** If you’re looking for a statement, black features—like an accent wall or black furniture—can add drama and character, transforming a mundane room into a visually striking space.
- **Modern Minimalism:** Black fits perfectly in minimalistic design. Its simplicity works to eliminate clutter and distractions, allowing you to focus on what truly matters.

### The Symbolic Nature of Black

Black holds various meanings in different cultures and contexts. Understanding these can deepen your appreciation for its use in design:

- **Elegance in Western Culture:** In many Western societies, black is synonymous with elegance, often seen in formal attire and high-end products.
- **Spirituality:** In some practices, black symbolizes the unknown or spiritual depth, which can lend an aura of mystery and intrigue to a space.
- **Modern Art Movements:** Many modern art movements embrace black, indicating rebellion against traditional styles and embracing new aesthetics.

Integrating black into your interior design doesn’t just create a visually appealing environment; it also impacts how you feel in that space. By understanding the psychological implications of black decor, you can better curate an atmosphere that suits your needs and preferences.

Using black decor can significantly influence the mood and aesthetic of your space. By smartly balancing it with other elements, you can create a modern look that is both inviting and sophisticated. Experimenting with textures, lighting, and contrasting colors will also help you harness the full potential of black in your home or office environment.

### Conclusion

Embracing black decor in your modern space not only enhances visual appeal but also taps into the emotional resonance it can create. By thoughtfully integrating black elements, such as furniture, artwork, and accessories, you can achieve a striking balance between sophistication and warmth. Consider the psychological impact of black, which can evoke feelings of elegance and strength, while also serving as a backdrop that allows other colors and textures to shine.

Using black decor doesn't mean your space will feel heavy or dark; instead, it can accentuate lightness and dimension when combined with lighter colors or reflective surfaces. For instance, pairing a sleek black sofa with vibrant throw pillows or a lively area rug can instantly transform the ambiance of a room. Additionally, layering different shades of black and contrasting materials can create an engaging visual narrative that keeps your space interesting and dynamic.

I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

I got myself a sunbeam barrister plus to start out with. 
I have been shopping around trying to find beans that actually have a unique flavour and not just taste ""like coffee"". 

I have my coffee black with 1 sugar.
 
My typical work load out is 2x twin cup cycles into my yeti rambler 20oz mug topped off with hot water and a touch of cold water to make it drinkable without having to wait ages for it to get to a temp that doesn't burn your mouth. 

I've tried playing with the grind settings to see if I can get any difference but only got the more acidic with the finer grind and longer brew time the machine sets to it. 
I typically leave my ring around the 26-28 mark and am currently doing manual timing around the 20-25secs.

So far I've tried around 15-20 different beans from different places and am yet to find something that really has a unique flavour to make it enjoyable and gives me the caffine hit I need for a 10hr day on the road as a field fitter. Currently the best beans I keep going for is either the ""Two14 expresso"" or the DC Dutchess or DC Darkness. 

With trying so many brands, it got me thinking of there is something wrong with my brew settings? ",1,1735295829.0,AustralianCoffee,2,1.0,False

Let’s talk about love… or, in my case, the absence of it. You see, I just ended a nine-year relationship. Nine years! That’s longer than some marriages, people. 

But you know what? I’m thriving now—so thriving, in fact, that my ex pops into my head sometimes, and I think, wouldn’t it be poetic justice if I accidentally puked on him next time I see him? Like, Oh hey, what a coincidence—BLAAAH!

But honestly, it feels so good to be free. I’m discovering myself again. Turns out, I’m actually pretty awesome. Who knew? My job’s great, my life’s great—I mean, I’m a structural engineer. My ex tried to manipulate me, but honey, I design buildings. I know exactly how to keep things stable under pressure.

But you know what’s funny about being single? Everyone immediately wants you to try dating apps. I told my friends I’m single, and they were like, 'Download Tinder!' I’m like, 'What’s the rush? I just left a nine-year relationship. Give me a moment to enjoy being free—maybe rewatch all of Breaking Bad without someone side-eyeing my snack choices. Yes, I’m eating bell peppers with hummus. What of it? Or, getting dirty fixing cars with my friends. And you know what? I’m actually having fun with that! But my ex? He’d say, 'That's such a poor person's way of thinking.'I mean, excuse me, sir. I wasn’t raised poor. I just like getting my hands dirty.

Dating apps are strange, aren’t they? Swipe left, swipe right—it feels like shopping for humans... But I’ll probably try it. Swipe left: too serious. Swipe right: too perfect. Swipe left: holding a fish? Ew. Swipe right: loves avocados? Maybe. Swipe left: oh no, it’s my ex! NOPE, NOT AGAIN!

Honestly, though, life has been amazing. Every day feels like a celebration now. You know you’re happy when you laugh at dumb things, like pouring coffee next to the mug because you're too busy talking…

And here’s the thing about being single after so long: I’m my own favorite person now. I make myself laugh, I take myself out for wine and cheese, and I'm loving it.

So to all single men or women out there, let’s raise a glass to freedom, self-love, and maybe one day accidentally puking on our exes. Thank you for taking the time to read this and wishing you a Happy New Year!

After spending weeks here and on several youtube rabbit holes (thank you) I had settled on a good new starter setup, all ready to buy brand new and ready to pull the trigger..

Until I found this (i believe to be ) great deal on a 2nd hand **Rocket Cellini Evo V2**, in my area, for a very fair price.

Seller seems confident and friendly (hi!), has used it monthly but not very regular the last year, and I can of course come by to have a taste, to see it working.

Originally I was going to go for single boiler, but if I'm honest knowing myself I was almost already lurking out for one of the bigger ones and having a Rocket (or similar) bodied and capable machine always felt like the next step.

So my question is essentially: when going over in a couple of days when inspecting/buying, what are the things I should take extra care on, check out extra, any known or hidden issues that I should check?  
I have asked my coffee store this too, they told me that most issues when used less come with the pump, and that they are very decent machines. I feel like if I see (and taste) them pulling a decent shot, that part is solved? Provided pics are not very detailed on parts or zoomed in much.

I know these are not the easiest ones to start with but I know myself well enough that I am going to put a lot of time in effort in here. tbh the thought of having a bigger machine straight away that can do both steaming and making a shot at the same time plus everything I've read on about the group, the machine and the brand - is very exciting to me!

For a grinder update I am thinking a new Baratza Sette 270wi now, but seller is also offering a used Eureka Zenith 65 E  
Anything else I should take into consideration?

For context am enjoying a great moccamaster for a while, but mostly drinking my espresso's and milk based coffee drinks elsewhere and ready to tumble into making these myself !

Thanks a bunch from NL, of course I will share setup once pulled here!!",1,1735294982.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I have a friend who I'm very close to and we've been hanging out a lot for 7 years now... she saw my deformed and ugly feet a few days ago... I don't show my feet to anyone and I try to hide them... but it happened that I went for a walk with her and we came across a store that sells sneakers that I like... the sneakers were 50% off and I didn't know how to go try on the sneakers without her seeing my disgusting feet... in the end I went to try on the sneakers hoping that she wouldn't notice... I bought the sneakers and we headed to my house and I was sure that she hadn't seen my feet... when we were drinking coffee she asked me why I was hiding my feet... I was so embarrassed I didn't know what to answer... she told me that you can make good money with feet like that, which I don't believe... and the biggest thing is that she has a fetish for deformed feet and I don't know how to act now... is it normal for someone to have a fetish for feet like that??? She convinced me to post a picture of my feet here... I'm 24 years old and I've had deformed feet since I was little... I've always wanted foot surgery, but unfortunately it's very expensive.

Tom Campbell is a physicist who has been acting as head experimentor at the Monroe Institute. He wrote the book \`My Big Toe\`. Toe standing for Theory of Everything. It is HIS Theory of Everything which implies that everybody else can have or develop a deviating Theory of Everything. That would be fine with him. According to Tom Campbell, reality is virtual, not \`real´ in the sense we understand it. To us this does not matter. If we have a cup of coffee, the taste does not change if we understand that the coffee, i.e. the liquid is composed of smaller parts, like little \`balls´, the molecules and the atoms. In the same way the taste of the coffee would not change if we are now introduced to the Virtual Reality Theory. According to him reality is reproduced at the rate of Planck time (10 to the power of 43 times per second). Thus, what we perceive as so-called outer reality is constantly reproduced. It vanishes before it is then reproduced again. And again and again and again. Similar to a picture on a computer screen. And this is basically what Bashar is describing as well. Everything collapses to a zero point. Constantly. And it is reproduced one unit of Planck time later. Just to collapse again and to be again reproduced. And you are constantly in a new universe/multiverse. And all the others as well. There is an excellent video on youtube (Tom Campbell and Jim Elvidge). The book \`My Big ToE´ is downloadable as well. I recommend starting with the video. Each universe is static, but when you move across some of them in a specific order (e.g. nos 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, etc.) you get the impression of movement and experience. Similar to a movie screen. If you change (the vibration of) your belief systems, you have access to frames nos 6, 11, 16, 21, 26 etc. You would then be another person in another universe, having different experiences. And there would be still \`a version of you´ having experiences in a reality that is composed of frames nos. 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 etc. But you are not the other you, and the other you is not you. You are in a different reality and by changing your belief systems consciously you can navigate across realities less randomly and in a more targeted way. That is basically everything the Bashar teachings are about.",1,1735294803.0,spirituality,0,1.0,False
