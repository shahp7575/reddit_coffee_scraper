Sorry for my English, it's not my first language and I don't feel like double checking what I write.

I don't remember the time before I've known my childhood best friend, we were born only 3 months apart and our parents were close friends when they had us. Our first photo is of us laying together in a crib. At least half of my childhood photos are with her, I avoid my family's photo albums because of it. I also avoid reminiscing about my childhood. We went to holidays together, visited each others extended families, shared hobbies, did everything together. 

We never had mutual friends, different preschools and high schools, and no classes together in elementary and middle school. Because of that a lot of people only knew us in the context of the other. Even now, years later when I visit my home town people ask me about her, like it's obvious I would know what to say. 

We started drifting apart in high school, I don't really know why and didn't notice at first. She would cancel meeting me last minute and not really plan the hang outs herself, but whenever we saw each other it was good, like it's always been.

So I ignored it and powered through, it was close to my 18th birthday by then and I couldn't imagine her not being a part of it. How could she spend my whole childhood with me, but not witness its ending? I promised myself that after that I would wait for her to text me first, invite me, whatever. And she never did. She showed up on my birthday, partied with my other friends, hugged me at the end, left and that was the last time I've seen her.

Years later my brain still wouldn't get that she wasn't part of my life anymore, in a lot of my dreams we still were friends, I would wake up in a rotten mood every few weeks because of it. I needed closure, so shortly after my 21st birthday, despite feeling pathetic about it, I texted her, explained how the last year of our friendship looked from my perspective and asked if she would consider meeting me for a coffee. She left me on delivered for a week, and on read ever since.

And it, to this day, guts me. Loosing a friend is hardly the worst thing I've went through and my life has been good. I'm close to finishing my degree, I'm living with the love of my life, I've got new friends and I'm still friends with all of the other people that were on my 18th birthday party. And despite all that, whenever I achieve a milestone, her not knowing about it hurts me the same way as dead family members not knowing about it.

And what caused me to think about all of this today, out of all days, years later? A stupid breakfast photo on a insta story. Shortly after I posted it I saw my followers count go down by one. Since only 10ish people saw it by then I got nosy and checked which of them unfollowed me. Well, it was her. And I know it doesn't change shit if she follows me or not, we haven't talked in years, I don't know anything about her anymore. Despite it I've felt the whole day like somebody put my insides the wrong side up.

So this is it, end of the Ted talk or whatever. I hope somebody reads it so it doesn't stay just in my head.",1,1763230582.0,lostafriend,0,1.0,False
1oxyqju,https://i.redd.it/ix182s6ojg1g1.png,Chaga mashroom powder: The Black Gold of the Forest,"Growing as a dark, cracked, charcoal-like mass on birch trees in cold northern climates, Chaga (*Inonotus obliquus*) is a fungus that has been used for centuries in Russian and Northern European folk medicine. It doesn't resemble a typical mushroom; instead, it's a sclerotium, a dense mass of hardened mycelium. This ""King of Medicinal Mushrooms"" is now the subject of intense modern scientific research, revealing a complex profile of bioactive compounds that offer significant health benefits. Unlike turmeric, its primary strength lies not in a single compound but in a powerful synergy of many.



# Quality

1. **Wild‑harvested sclerotium** \- the true canker taken from a birch tree
2. **Mycelium grown on grain** (IoMFG) - Grain‑grown (rice or oats) mycelium often ends up similar to the cereal it’s grown on: relatively low in beta‑glucans and high in **alpha‑glucans**, which are mostly inactive starches that dilute the mushroom’s active compounds.

The difference matters because the healing reputation of Chaga depends largely on its **beta‑glucans**, beneficial structural carbohydrates found in the true sclerotium. Quick buying tips:

* **Look for “sclerotium” or “fruiting body”** on the label rather than “mycelium on grain.”
* **Check for beta‑glucan percent or standardized extract**—higher numbers mean more of the active stuff.
* **Prefer dual (hot water + alcohol) extracts or clearly labeled high‑beta‑glucan powders** rather than plain powdered chips or grain‑based mycelium.





# Positive Health Effects of Chaga (The ""Why"")

Chaga's health benefits are attributed to its rich and unique composition, which it derives primarily from the birch trees it grows on. Chaga absorbs **betulin** from the birch tree and turns it into **betulinic acid**, a compound studied for its **immune-supporting effects**.

1. **Beta‑D‑glucans** regulate and “train” the immune system by modulating **cytokine** signalling and supporting *macrophages* and *natural killer* (NK) cells. Unlike a simple “immune boost,” they strengthen defenses against infection while calming overactive responses. As **adaptogens**, they improve resilience to stress and help restore balanced immune responses.
2. **Antioxidants.** Chaga has one of the highest **ORAC scores (146,700)** in the world. Its **phenolic compounds** neutralize harmful free radicals, while its **melanins**—the same pigment that protects human skin—help shield cells from oxidative stress. These neutralize free radicals, protect cells from oxidative stress, and, by reducing that stress, help lower chronic inflammation linked to aging and many diseases.
3. **Cancer.** Modern research shows promising effects of Chaga in animal studies. Extracts appear to slow tumor growth and can trigger cancer cells to self-destruct (apoptosis) without harming healthy cells.
   1. Betulin from Chage directly targets the mitochondria of tumor cells, the cellular powerhouses responsible for energy production. By disrupting mitochondrial function, it triggers apoptosis (programmed cell death) specifically within cancerous cells, a pathway that has shown efficacy even against tumor types resistant to conventional chemotherapy.
4. **Liver.** Chaga may also help protect the liver from damage and reduce oxidative stress linked to conditions like fatty liver disease. 
5. **Inflammation**. Betulin from Chaga reduces systemic inflammation by inhibiting the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, molecules that modulate immune responses. Betulinic acid, which features a carboxyl group, also exhibits promising biological activities, including anti-HIV and broad antimicrobial effects.
6. **Gut Health.** The anti-inflammatory properties of Chaga may benefit individuals with inflammatory bowel conditions. Furthermore, as a prebiotic, the polysaccharides can help nourish the beneficial microbiome, which is crucial for overall health.
   1. A study published in *Molecules(*[https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807453/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35807453/) *)* found that both water- and alcohol-based extracts protected cells from inflammation triggered by pathogenic microbes, underscoring Chaga’s potential to support gut integrity and overall immune balance.
7. **Blood Sugar.** Animal studies show Chaga can lower fasting and post‑meal glucose, enhance pancreatic insulin production, reduce insulin resistance, and inhibit carbohydrate‑digesting enzymes (like alpha‑glucosidase) to blunt glucose spikes.
8. **Cholesterol.** Hypolipidemic effects were shown in preclinical studies, lowering LDL (""bad"") and triglycerides while raising HDL(""good""), changes that may reduce cardiovascular risk.



# Possible Negative Effects (The ""What to Avoid"")

Chaga’s strong natural acids can be harmful if consumed the wrong way.

1. **High Oxalate Risk.** Chaga is packed with oxalates, compounds that can bind with calcium to form crystals. In excess, these crystals may build up in tissues, cause gout, or damage the kidneys by leading to kidney stones or even kidney failure.
   1. 72-year-old woman in Japan who consumed 4–5 teaspoons of raw Chaga daily for 6 months and died from kidney failure.
   2. 69-year-old man, taking 10–15g daily with vitamin C for 3 months, developed severe kidney damage.
   3. Strictly avoid consuming the raw, ground, solid state. Use only water- or alcohol-extracted forms (tea, tincture, pre-extracted powder)
   4. Be cautious with high-dose calcium supplements, as excess calcium can bind with oxalates and strain the kidneys.
   5. Steer clear of vitamin C supplements, as they exacerbated oxalate nephropathy in cases.
   6. 100 grams of dried Chaga contains significant soluble oxalates (800 mg, roughly equivalent to half a cup of spinach)
2. **Blood Thinning.** Chaga contains coumarin, a natural blood thinner. This can increase the risk of bleeding or bruising, especially for people taking medications like warfarin, clopidogrel, or aspirin, or before surgery.
3. **Blood Sugar.** Chaga may lower blood sugar levels. People with diabetes or hypoglycemia should monitor closely, as it can intensify the effects of medication and potentially cause dangerously low levels.
4. **Immune System.** In some cases, Chaga may overstimulate the immune system, which could trigger flare-ups in people with autoimmune conditions.

# 

# When to Consume Chaga:

* **In the Morning.** It offers a gentle, non‑jittery, caffeine‑free, sustained energy boost that makes a good coffee alternative.  Experts suggest daily use (about 6 days a week) for at least 5 weeks to allow its adaptogenic and immunomodulatory effects to develop, but cycle off periodically to avoid tolerance.
* **During Times of Stress:** As an adaptogen, consuming it daily during physically or mentally stressful periods can help support resilience.

# 

# How to Consume Chaga

Chaga is very hard and nearly indigestible raw (the safest option is buying pre‑extracted powders). Its active compounds must be extracted with hot water or alcohol to be bioavailable. Simply mixing the powder into cold water will not release its primary medicinal properties. The typical limit is up to 2g/day.



**Water Extract:**

1. For one cup, use **0.5-1 teaspoon of Chaga powder** or 1-2 chunks of dried Chaga.
2. Add to a saucepan with **8-12 oz of near-boiling water** (do not use a rolling boil, as extreme heat can degrade some compounds).
3. Simmer gently for at least **10-15 minutes**. Longer simmering (up to an hour or more) will yield a stronger, more potent extraction.
4. Strain into a mug. The resulting liquid will be a dark, coffee-like color with a slightly earthy, vanilla-like flavor.

# Alcohol Extraction (Tincture)

1. **Prepare.** Break dried Chaga chunks into small pieces or grind into coarse powder. The smaller the pieces, the more surface area for extraction.
2. **Choose the alcohol.** Use **40–50% alcohol** (vodka or grain alcohol diluted with water). This strength extracts and keeps the tincture shelf-stable.
3. **Wait.** Place Chaga in a glass jar (about 1 part Chaga to 5 parts alcohol). Seal the jar tightly. Store in a cool, dark place for **at least 4–6 weeks**, shaking occasionally.
4. **Strain.** After soaking, strain out the solids using cheesecloth or a fine filter. Keep the liquid — this is your **alcohol extract**.

# Dual Extraction (to capture water-soluble compounds too)

1. **Simmer the leftover Chaga.** After straining, take the same Chaga solids and simmer them gently in water (not boiling hard) for 1–2 hours. Strain out solids — keep this **water extract**.
2. **Combine.** Mix the cooled water extract with the alcohol extract in a clean jar. Final product contains both alcohol-soluble triterpenes (like betulinic acid) and water-soluble polysaccharides (like beta-glucans). This is the best way to get Chaga’s full benefits.

# Storage

* Store in dark glass bottles (amber dropper bottles work best).
* Shelf life: usually **1+ years** thanks to alcohol.





# Tracking Chaga with the [Vitamin App](https://apple.co/42OdSEx)

To get the most out of chaga, consistency is key. Use the [Vitamin app](https://apple.co/42OdSEx) developed by [Martspec to log doses](https://martspec.com/vitamin), set reminders, and track your intake.

# How to set it up and use it

* **Create a custom entry** for Chaga Powder and record the dose in milligrams.
* **Schedule daily reminders** to take it with food and mark doses as taken.
* **Track context** like co‑supplements, meal timing, or products with black pepper to record factors that affect absorption.
* **Review trends** with the app’s history share that record with your healthcare provider when needed.

# Conclusion: A Powerful Fungal Ally, Demanding Respect and Caution

Chaga is a remarkable medicinal fungus with profound immune-modulating and antioxidant properties. Its ability to help the body adapt to stress and fight oxidative damage makes it a valuable tool in the modern wellness arsenal.

However, its high oxalate content presents a serious and non-negotiable risk for a significant portion of the population.",1,1763230575.0,u_Antique_Way_3813,0,1.0,False

I want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid educational advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:

* [Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements](https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/US/en/technical-documents/technical-article/clinical-testing-and-diagnostics-manufacturing/hematology/blood-basics)(about 7%), and other elements such as electrolytes, mineral salts, sugars, fats, hormones, and vitamins. With proper protein consumption, hydration, and electrolyte drinks, the body does replenish plasma volume (mainly the water component) within about 24–48 hours after donation, especially with adequate hydration and nutrition. However,[the full restoration of plasma proteins may take several days](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), and the 48-hour interval between donations is mandated primarily for donor safety and to allow partial replenishment, but not necessarily because all components are fully restored in 48 hours.
* [During **plasmapheresis**](https://bio.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/Introductory_and_General_Biology/General_Biology_(Boundless)/40:_The_Circulatory_System/40.08:_Components_of_the_Blood_-_Plasma_and_Serum), blood is drawn, plasma is separated, and **red blood cells (and other components) are returned to the donor in cycles**.
* Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.[Donor identification systems are in place](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)to **track donations across centers**; attempting to donate more frequently can risk your health and may result in being barred from donation.

1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating. Your plasma protein levels are influenced by [your **overall diet over several days**](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), not just the immediate pre-donation meal.
2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated.[It's important to stay hydrated](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)at least the day before, and the day of your donation.
3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. **Caffeine is a mild diuretic** and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited,[it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as[it can dehydrate you](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma).
5. No strenuous exercise for[at least 6 hours after donating](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.
6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure.[Most centers recommend](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma)avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.
7. [If your pulse rate is above 100](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/body/22865-plasma), you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate,[the box breathing technique](https://www.healthline.com/health/copd/box-breathing/)may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.
8. There is[a risk of getting a blown vein](https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/000045.htm/)if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok,[your body is able to heal and repair your veins](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq) via normal tissue healing.
9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine[it prevents that from happening](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating). There will also be what’s called[an anticoagulant liquid](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/blood-donor-eligibility/blood-donation-process/)that will prevent you from getting blood clots.
10. You may be[subject to drug screening](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor). The[drug screening tests](https://www.redcrossblood.org/faq.html#eligibility-medications%5C)for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.
11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically[to test for certain sexually transmitted infections](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)(STIs). A positive test will result in[either a temporary or permanent deferral](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

* Wait[at least a few hours](https://www.cslplasma.com/start-donating)before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating[to reduce bleeding and bruising risks](https://www.redcrossblood.org/donate-blood/blood-donation-process/after-your-donation.html/).
* [You can use Castor Oil](https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/castor-oil)on the needle site[for the puncture area to heal better](https://www.mayoclinic.org/first-aid/first-aid-minor-cuts/basics/art-20056711). A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.
* Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having[decreased immunoglobulin levels](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/VitaminD-Consumer//).
* Red meats are[particularly high in the protein nutrients](https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/food-features/meat/)found in plasma.
* **Taking vitamin and mineral supplements** (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)[is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess](https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/list-VitaminsMinerals//). Most people get enough from their diet. **Protein shakes** before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

# Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

[Absence of Complications](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq): This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management,[you must be healthy when you donate](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor)and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. [Healthy Feet](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.
2. [Steady Balance](https://www.cslplasma.com/faq/new-donor): You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.
3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation[is highly encouraged for all donors](https://www.cslplasma.com/blog).

3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or it's possible you could get nauseous, lightheaded, vomit, or faint during your donation. Caffeine is a mild diuretic and can contribute to dehydration, while not prohibited, it's recommended to avoid caffeine before you donate.

4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating as it can dehydrate you.

5. No strenuous exercise for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. Some centers may recommend a longer or shorter time than 6 hours before exercising, but 6 hours is the average recommendation.

6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but the nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate and your blood pressure. Most centers recommend avoiding smoking or vaping nicotine at least 30 minutes to 2 hours before donating.

7. If your pulse rate is above 100, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate, the box breathing technique may also help ease your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to binaural beats that are known to reduce anxiety and lower heart rate, at a low to medium volume with earbuds/headphones. Or try listening to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low to medium volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure.

8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to heal and repair your veins via normal tissue healing.

9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. There will also be what’s called an anticoagulant liquid that will prevent you from getting blood clots.

10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma.

11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.

• Wait at least a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating to reduce bleeding and bruising risks.

• You can use Castor Oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle. However, certain people may be allergic to Castor Oil, in that case Vitamin E/Mineral Oil can be used instead, but certain people may also be allergic to that too. Use of topical agents is not part of official plasma donation guidelines. If you choose to use them, be aware of potential allergies.

• Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased immunoglobulin levels.

• Red meats are particularly high in the protein nutrients found in plasma.

• Taking vitamin and mineral supplements (e.g., vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, zinc, iron)is generally safe in moderation but can be harmful in excess. Most people get enough from their diet. Protein shakes before donation are not required but can help maintain protein levels.

Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes

Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:

Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.

Insulin: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, you must be healthy when you donate and be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low). A 3-month wait period applies to non-prescribed drugs.

1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation.

2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing.

3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is highly encouraged for all donors.

My boyfriends input is honestly a bit limited because while he does know his parents and love them, he’s also not the most creative gift giver and doesn’t have a super communicative relationship with them, and I’m always trying to think of creative gifts for people that will mean a lot. 

Last year we got his mom some art supplies and a hand painted mug and we got his dad another nice mug and some local coffee because his dad is really into coffee and his mom was trying to get better at painting ( both his ideas). But this year, I was hoping to get them something a little more creative; with the issue being that neither me, nor my partner really know what kinds of things would be special to them outside of their respective hobbies which we focused more on last year. 

I’ve been tossing around the idea of maybe getting them an Airbnb that would be nice and they could stay in when they came and visited us but that also sounds expensive and hard to execute (they’re separated but on good terms). So any ideas on gifts that feel personal without needing to be super personalized?? 

We’d like to stick to a budget of around $150 total or $75 each but would be open to spending a little more for something perfect.

The only brand that works (most of the time) is cafe bustelo, since their grounds are pretty smooth.

So I am looking for something better, but I also could be looking for a unicorn. I focus exclusively on lattes, so a machine that supports lattes and frothing would be very crucial to me. I would appreciate minimal cleaning,  but Im used to doing cleaning cycles every day when I'm done.

I dont need anything super fancy. I am very much a beginner to espresso/lattes and would not be able to understand or appreciate a high-end machine.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Edmonton Oilers vs. Carolina Hurricanes: A Tale of Wounded Warriors and Goalie Acrobatics**

Ladies and gentlemen, prepare for a clash of titans where the Edmonton Oilers, fresh off a seven-game road trip longer than a Netflix series with no ending, face the Carolina Hurricanes, currently riding a five-game winning streak smoother than a Carolina BBQ sauce. Let’s parse the chaos with the precision of a Zamboni operator on a caffeine buzz.

---

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

First, the cold, hard math. The Hurricanes are listed at **-115** (implied probability: **53.5%**), while the Oilers sit at **-104** (**50.5%**). It’s a statistical photo finish, like two skaters tying for the fastest skate in a race against a coffee machine. The puck line? Hurricanes are -1.5 at -265, meaning they must win by two to satisfy the bookies. The Oilers, meanwhile, are +1.5 at +210, offering a “lose by one and you’re a hero” proposition. The over/under is **6.5 goals**, with the projected total at **6.6**—so bettors are betting on a shootout worthy of a *Hockey Night in Canada* classic.

### News Digest: Injuries, Comebacks, and a Toaster比喻

**Edmonton’s Big Bang Theory (of Hope):** Zach Hyman, the Oilers’ goal-scoring wizard (27+ goals annually since 2021), returns from a **fractured wrist** sustained in the Western Conference finals. Think of him as Batman after a two-year hiatus—still brooding, but now with a fresh cast. His $5.5M salary? A reminder that Edmonton’s GM is either a genius or a man who once bet his house on a horse named “Slowpoke.” The Oilers, though, are a 2-3-1 mess on their road trip, like a tourist trying to navigate Raleigh without Google Maps.

**Carolina’s Miracle on the Rink:** The Hurricanes just outlasted the Canucks 4-3 in OT, thanks to Taylor Hall’s heroics and Sebastian Aho’s 17th OT goal (a career milestone that should be in the

I felt happy when they took a chance with new main characters instead of prolonging Ash's story, and even though the new series has had its issues, I've been pleased with the writers being willing to take chances with the storytelling and take a totally different approach from the Ash-centric series. I've mostly enjoyed Horizons despite its lackluster treatment of non-starter Pokemon and lacking Pokemon battles.  
  
>!However, ever since Mega Voltage, I've been growing more discontent with Horizons, and this primarily concerns the treatment of characters like Liko and Dot (Liko in particular).!<

>!I was hoping the Blueberry arc would rectify some of the issues and address the problems of Mega Voltage, but instead it's made things a whole lot worse.!<

>!One of the reasons our cast arrived to Blueberry Academy, aside from Briar, was to get some training. Blueberry Academy is a school that specializes in Pokemon battling, and since our characters suffered defeat at the end of the previous arc due to their insufficient strength vs Rakurium-powered Six Heroes, you'd imagine that this kind of setting would be ideal for the characters to learn new things, to develop new tactics, learn new moves, in particular how to cooperate in double battles, which is Blueberry's speciality.!<

>!We are three episodes into the arc (with the summaries hinting at the possibility that they might leave Blueberry on the fifth episode), and no actual training has taken place yet. Roy fought and lost to Nemona, but he didn't really learn much from this battle aside from the fact that the Blueberry training benefited Nemona, and that he needs more training too.!<

>!The second episode featured Roy vs Drayten. Even though I was annoyed by Roy getting multiple back-to-back episodes of focus, I was willing to give the show the benefit of the doubt because at least Liko was training with her own Pokemon too, instead of Roy getting all the battle focus. !<

>!Yesterday's episode, however, was atrocious. For whatever reason, the writers decided that Liko would pause her training and spend *the entire episode* just standing around in Briar's office, handing her stuff like coffee. I'm genuinely baffled by this writing choice because these characters are meant to be involved in heavy training to boost their strength, and instead we're getting gags about Carmine getting annoyed by Liko being a talented...assistant? Huh? What? What the actual fuck?!<

>!Then, the writers finally acknowledge that Dot is another trainer who came here to get some training. She gets to fight Carmine, cool right? Actually no, because Dot is blessed with a gag battle that lasts a few seconds and doesn't amount to much beyond Kieran finally being referenced. Was there a reason Dot couldn't have a serious fight with Carmine? Was it not possible to have Carmine and Anne train with Liko and Dot instead of wasting their screentime in Briar's office?!<

>!Uruto actually gets *some* kind of training done and even battles Lacey, which leaves me wondering: why do Roy and Uruto get to fight Drayton and Lacey, while Liko and Dot get to either stand around doing nothing, or participate in gag battles that amount to nothing? Why does Roy get to battle Drayton two times while Liko and Dot haven't battled a single person from the Blueberry Elite 4? Why is there no emphasis on double battles and characters learning new tricks and strategies or their Pokemon learning new moves and combos? Why are only the boy characters granted the privilege of fighting the Elite 4? !<

It’s late again, the kind of late where the room feels heavier than usual.
I’m sitting with my phone face up, still open on chats that started with potential and ended with nothing. I try, I really do. I start conversations, ask people how their day went, try to actually get to know them instead of tossing out empty lines. Some reply once, some twice, and then it turns into that quiet slow fade where you can tell their interest slipped through their fingers the moment something more exciting appeared.

Sometimes I even joke with myself about how my conversations look like tiny graveyards. Names I tried to connect with, each one ending in a short reply or a seen message that goes nowhere. And I still keep trying, because the alternative is to stop trying altogether and that feels worse than the silence.

There are evenings I step out of the house just to feel less stuck. I’ll grab coffee or walk through the mall pretending I’m just clearing my head, when really I’m hoping to accidentally bump into someone who sees me the way I hope to be seen. I look around and watch friends taking pictures, couples leaning on each other, people laughing into their phones. I sit down somewhere and scroll so I don’t look like I’m waiting for someone who never shows up.

I’ve had moments where I tried going casual. Just to feel something. Just to break the monotony. But those moments always end the same way. The closeness disappears as fast as it came and leaves me with the same quiet room and the same thoughts I tried to shake off. I end up realizing I want more than a quick fix. I want a person, not an escape.
The strange thing is, tonight the loneliness didn’t hit me the same way.

It didn’t crush me or sit on my chest.
It made me think.
I realized that the ache I carry isn’t desperation. It’s honesty. It’s the version of me that I usually hide during the day because everyone expects men to keep their emotions locked away like some fragile secret.
But here’s the part that feels different now.
I’m not looking for someone to sweep in and give meaning to my life.
I’m crave for someone who meets me at eye level. Someone who tries back.
Someone who wants to stay, not out of convenience but because the connection feels natural.

Maybe she’s out there right now, scrolling through her own chats, wondering why nothing feels real anymore. Maybe she’s tired of shallow conversations and tired of being the only one who puts effort into anything. Maybe she’s dealing with the same kind of quiet that I’m sitting in. That thought alone shifts something in me.

Not in a dramatic way.
Just enough to make the room feel less heavy. So instead of wishing for someone to walk into my life tonight, I’m choosing something smaller but strangely comforting. I’m choosing to believe that lonely people don’t stay lonely forever. They eventually find their matching tired soul who still believes in genuine connection.

And maybe the right person won’t be the one who replies the fastest or says all the pretty things. Maybe she’ll be the one who doesn’t disappear.

The one who answers honestly.
The one who shows up consistently.
The one who feels real in a world full of people pretending to care.
That possibility is enough for tonight.
Not closure. Not certainty.
Just a quiet reminder that I haven’t run out of chances.
And somehow, that makes the loneliness feel a little less sharp.",1,1763229720.0,DatingInIndia,0,1.0,False

Hi all, I can't believe I'm asking for advice from a bunch of strangers on the internet but I don't really have anyone I can talk to about this. Sorry for the incoming essay but I guess I need to give history. I bought my first house in September last year, It was an odd time but everything just fell into place. It's quite a small village and everyone is really friendly so I got to know my neighbours soon after moving in - yes, socially distanced. Then I met my over-the-road neighbour, let's call her Elle. I can't describe it but it's the first time I've ever met someone and been lost for words and my heart was racing and just thought ""omg"", y'know?? So after I blushed my way through a welcome to the village type convo we only saw each other for a wave and hello for a few days. 

To help kinda settle in I had my dog (Bea) with me for the first few weeks. During this time there was a massive increase in dog thefts in a nearby town, not just from gardens but literally wrestled away from people. If I'd have been working (furloughed off and on since March) then I would've taken Bea back to mum's but since I was home with her all day she stayed. So the local police advised to not walk dogs alone but we go out twice a day, a 10k run in the morning and a few miles walk in the evening. So obvs this scares me, but at the same time she is honestly a pain in the arse and gets upset if she doesn't go for a run and needs to be tired out so I'm kind of stuck at this point. Then along comes Elle. She knocked on the door and offered to come with us as she'd seen Bea and me in the evenings and everything kind of spiralled from there. I told her about my morning runs but she didn't really bite so I thought nothing of it. Then a few days later I bumped into her on a run, so she started joining us on those too.

A few months later and we are spending more and more time together everyday. It has now progressed to a run early morning, afternoon coffee, dinner most evenings and then the evening walk. It just seemed to happen without me really noticing. I didn't read into things that much as I don't want to get my hopes up and ruin anything until another neighbour commented about how much time we spend together and how ""it's nice to see you young gals getting on"" and winked. *She actually winked at me*. I asked her what she meant but she just laughed and said ""you know what I mean"". **So now I'm looking back on things and wondering if she could like me too?** 

Here's some reasons why she might like me: 


- I went running along the same route at the same time for nearly 2 weeks before I happened to run into her a few days after I told her this?


- I make her a coffee every afternoon (Elle is WFH) and take it over in her fave mug. She says I make good coffee but I'm pretty sure I saw a fancy coffee machine the first time I went round (it's not there now?).


- Elle carried on running and walking with me even after Bea went home. I told her she was going back to mum's and she said well ""I'll have to make another excuse to join you"" and then we just carried on everyday.


- She has tried really hard to bond with Bea. Bea is a very anxious dog and is scared of everyone except me and mum. Elle bought special treats to give her everyday and has been so amazing with her and never tried to force anything. When I asked her she said ""it's important to me that she likes me and is comfortable"". Bea actually fell asleep between us on the sofa yesterday and It just makes my heart skip a beat guys. 


- She invited me to the zoom quiz she does with her friends every fortnight or so and they were all like ""oh so this is who we've heard so much about ""


- We realised we had become each other's support bubble. Elle asked if I was meeting anyone else and I said no, she said she was glad she had me all to herself (!!)


- We gave each other quite personal xmas presents. Like, it actually made me tear up it meant so much to me. And she bought stuff for Bea!! 

Reasons why she might not like me:


- All the reasons above, but that she's just doing them because she's a fucking great person and we're friends? 

It might sound dumb but idk I need your help guys. She is the just the most incredible person I have ever met and I really really like her but if she isn't gay or doesn't feel the same I don't want to lose her friendship as she has become such a huge part of my life. I genuinely have no experience with these kind of things as I went to quite a strict all girls school, so it's not as if there were any relationships around me as a teen and then I went to a very small uni (8 of us on my course). I guess another reason is that I've struggled with anxiety and depression for the past 10 years, as well as my weight and working on my self confidence, but I can say that right now I am the happiest and healthiest (both mentally and physically) I have ever been. I've only just really become comfortable with the fact that I'm gay and I have never really told anyone in real life, but I don't think people would be too surprised lol. I don't have any close friends as no one stuck around when I was really struggling with my MH a few years ago so I can't discuss this with anyone irl. 

So I need your advice : **how do I find out if she is gay?** And no, I don't have the confidence to just ask!! What if she says no and I ruin everything? She has never mentioned anything about past relationships and I'm pretty tactless so not sure how I could naturally slip it into the convo. Like, ""hey tell me have you ever had a girlfriend? Do you want one now?"" Lol. 
**And how can I make a move without really making a move so I don't ruin things??**

tl;dr : Don't know whether my neighbour is gay and into me or is just really friendly. How can I make a move without ruining our friendship?

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**throwawayyyy4067**

>Aaaaah!!! Honestly, judging by what you wrote, I'm pretty sure she's into women and into you, especially considering your neighbors' and her friends' reactions. I'm a wlw myself and I know this type of scenario can be so nerve-wracking :D If that's your style, maybe you could wear some pride accessories around her, or mention some LGBTQ+ book/movie/show... that you liked a lot (if it's not too obscure and she's into women, chances are she's seen/read/heard of it too) and gauge her reaction :) Sorry if this isn't of much help for you, either way I'm keeping my fingers crossed for you!!! Keep me updated, I love love stories :D

**OOP**

>>I like this suggestion, I feel like I could bring that into conversation fairly naturally- thanks. My only worry then is if I still don't get a clear response lol. But I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get to it

**someone_you_kno**

>Why don’t you ask if she has any special plans for Valentine’s Day and then kinda work your way in from there? It’s a super light topic and a easy way to see if there’s someone else or she’ll suggest you 2 hang out!

**OOP**

>>I mean we are in a country wide lockdown so I'm not sure what special plans she could have tbh. Although I guess I could kinda joke about it??

**Edit: Ok guys, thank you so so much for all your support and encouragement. You've all given me a lot to think about. I think I'm going to casually slip some gay stuff into conversation and see how she reacts. Then bring up the neighbours comment like some of you suggested, seeing as tho the neighbour was heavily implying that we're gay. I'll do it tonight otherwise I'll talk myself out of it again. I will post an update to let you know what happens (eek). If you never hear from me again assume it went badly and I am consoling myself with cake and watching brokeback mountain in floods of tears**

Hi reddit, yes it's me the useless lesbian. 
First off I want to thank you all for your support, encouragement and advice - and the undeserved awards! I never expected this many of you to take the time to comment and that so many of you were rooting for us. 

So I had the plan to drop these gay hints into convo like you guys suggested but honestly it all went out the window. Elle was kinda stressed friday after a shitty work zoom and just needed to vent so it wasnt the right time to start anything. 
Though I guess I must have been a bit off thanks to spending all day overthinking things on here, as Elle turned up Saturday morning rambling about stressing me out and apologised (!!) for ruining dinner. Obvs I said ""what are you talking about you can talk to me about anything"", and she said *""anything?""* and I said *""anything""* back. And guys the tension was unreal, staring at each other and hoping our lesbian mind reading powers would kick in. 

Then there was some loud noise like a car backfiring or something and the moment went. So I went to make coffee and then Elle asked me why I was a bit quiet the night before and I said something about overthinking stuff and she said ""what stuff"" and idk you guys I wasnt prepared to be put on the spot my casual gay pop culture references were useless in this moment. My mind just went completely blank and I forgot every single thing you guys suggested and my heart was pounding and I just blurted out **you know I like you, right?**. 

...And then she kissed me. *Kissed me*. We straight up just snogged in the kitchen and it was fucking great. So...you were right. You were all fucking right. She's gay, she likes me and has been trying to drop hints for nearly 5 months. *sigh* 

We were both just too scared to make a move or ruin anything. Turns out she's been burned by straight girls in the past, so she's pretty wary and was hoping I'd straight up say I'm a lesbian so she'd know for sure - maybe the I'm a lesbian wall hanging would've been a good idea after all? Her friends have been helping her drop hints, she showed me the group chat and guys their suggestions ranged from flirting more to just turning up in a trenchcoat and nothing else lol. Also, the winking neighbour has been making comments to her as well, so shout out to her for trying to make this happen too. 

So no cake and cry watching brokeback mountain, just 5 months of dating to catch up on. As for worrying about how our current schedule could be more date like during lockdown, you were right it's kinda irrelevant when you've essentially been dating the whole time. Though we never made it to our morning run yesterday, in fact we didn't leave the house at all, ha.

Thank you guys for giving me hope, even if all your suggestions completely disappeared in the moment. Maybe I'll show her the post later and ask if any of the suggestions would have worked.

tl;dr: she's gay, into me and I'm an idiot

She's kind, smart, loyal, and beautiful. My life genuinely feels better with her in it.

I decided to pursue a master’s degree in another country. We talked about it beforehand, and she was very supportive—she was even considering doing the same eventually, but she wasn’t ready yet. So our relationship became long-distance last year. We talk every day, and I still feel her in my daily life. It’s hard, but we’ve stayed connected.

Since moving, I sometimes found myself attracted to other women. I’d have fantasies and felt awful about it.

Then one of these women invited me out for coffee, and I agreed. I told myself it would just be a casual meetup. During the coffee, I made a point to mention that I’m in a relationship and that I love my girlfriend. I even emphasized how good my life is with her. The girl seemed a bit disappointed, but we just talked and went our separate ways. We stayed in contact, though.

A few weeks later, I was stressed with my studies and agreed to hang out with her again. As we were talking, I felt so emotional and touch-starved that I just wanted to hug her. I did. I wasn't thinking straight. We went back to her place, and I hugged her more. We eventually ended up in her bed. It was emotional and sexual, though we didn’t have intercourse.  My judgment was completely off.

I think I was overwhelmed, stressed, and I let the situation happen. I met up with her a few more times the following week, but it was mostly talking and the sexual tension faded. Every time, I felt guilty. Eventually I cut off contact completely.

This all happened in May. I haven’t told my girlfriend, and I’m probably not going to. I feel like telling her would only hurt her, especially because she’s currently doing exams and preparing for her own studies. If I felt she wasn’t very invested in our relationship, I’d break up with her immediately because I know what I did makes me a bad partner.

I’m looking for advice.

1oxy6hl,https://www.reddit.com/r/ThirtiesIndia/comments/1oxy6hl/30_m_soon_to_be_1_nights_that_feel_too_quiet/,"[30] M, Soon to be +1 | Nights That Feel Too Quiet","It’s late again, the kind of late where the room feels heavier than usual.
I’m sitting with my phone face up, still open on chats that started with potential and ended with nothing. I try, I really do. I start conversations, ask people how their day went, try to actually get to know them instead of tossing out empty lines. Some reply once, some twice, and then it turns into that quiet slow fade where you can tell their interest slipped through their fingers the moment something more exciting appeared.

Sometimes I even joke with myself about how my conversations look like tiny graveyards. Names I tried to connect with, each one ending in a short reply or a seen message that goes nowhere. And I still keep trying, because the alternative is to stop trying altogether and that feels worse than the silence.

There are evenings I step out of the house just to feel less stuck. I’ll grab coffee or walk through the mall pretending I’m just clearing my head, when really I’m hoping to accidentally bump into someone who sees me the way I hope to be seen. I look around and watch friends taking pictures, couples leaning on each other, people laughing into their phones. I sit down somewhere and scroll so I don’t look like I’m waiting for someone who never shows up.

I’ve had moments where I tried going casual. Just to feel something. Just to break the monotony. But those moments always end the same way. The closeness disappears as fast as it came and leaves me with the same quiet room and the same thoughts I tried to shake off. I end up realizing I want more than a quick fix. I want a person, not an escape.
The strange thing is, tonight the loneliness didn’t hit me the same way.

It didn’t crush me or sit on my chest.
It made me think.
I realized that the ache I carry isn’t desperation. It’s honesty. It’s the version of me that I usually hide during the day because everyone expects men to keep their emotions locked away like some fragile secret.
But here’s the part that feels different now.
I’m not looking for someone to sweep in and give meaning to my life.
I’m crave for someone who meets me at eye level. Someone who tries back.
Someone who wants to stay, not out of convenience but because the connection feels natural.

Maybe she’s out there right now, scrolling through her own chats, wondering why nothing feels real anymore. Maybe she’s tired of shallow conversations and tired of being the only one who puts effort into anything. Maybe she’s dealing with the same kind of quiet that I’m sitting in. That thought alone shifts something in me.

Not in a dramatic way.
Just enough to make the room feel less heavy. So instead of wishing for someone to walk into my life tonight, I’m choosing something smaller but strangely comforting. I’m choosing to believe that lonely people don’t stay lonely forever. They eventually find their matching tired soul who still believes in genuine connection.

And maybe the right person won’t be the one who replies the fastest or says all the pretty things. Maybe she’ll be the one who doesn’t disappear.

The one who answers honestly.
The one who shows up consistently.
The one who feels real in a world full of people pretending to care.
That possibility is enough for tonight.
Not closure. Not certainty.
Just a quiet reminder that I haven’t run out of chances.
And somehow, that makes the loneliness feel a little less sharp.",3,1763229290.0,ThirtiesIndia,0,1.0,False

In the start of our relationship she was extremely hyper sexual and we would constantly exchange flirty texts and videos and would be on eachother at any chance we had. This went on for about 3 months and these last 3 it’s been a night and day difference in our relationship.

 One night we had a very vulnerable conversation on both sides about our pasts and she revealed that she has a lot of past trauma with intimacy ( i knew some of it but not all of it so i let her take initiative on any advances in our relationship like. physical touch, affection and intimacy) so i’m very understanding with it and i was respecting of her not being interested in sex so i stopped talking  about it but it but i am struggling to feel loved because even normal affection like hugging and kissing i felt guilty so i asked her if she was okay with even that and she assured me that she 100% trusts me to tell me what she’s feeling because i had shown her in the past that i respect her with things like saying no and stop so i continued to love her as much as she would let me but it has taken such a toll on my self worth and has me questioning my value as a partner because even things like compliments from her are had to come by. 

She has acknowledged that she’s not as affectionate as she used to be and she apologized but it’s not just affection it just feeels likes she’s withdrawn from our relationship and i’ve told her multiple times and then it’s better for a few days and then it gets worse. Recently we’ve been better until a few days ago she opened up a conversation about how she really wants to have sex and so we proceed to flirt over the phone and she joked about it in person and flirted some more and then she got really distant. We went on a coffee date and she had looked at me with this look in her eyes i’d never seen before, it looked like she had fallen out of love and was looking everywhere but me any time i talked to her or attempted to hold eye contact. 

We got into a fight the other night and eventually led to her bringing up how she doesn’t want to hear about sex or talk about sex and how half the time she just does it( it as in flirting) because she thinks i like it. she was mean and dismissive leading up to our argument I tried to tell her how it makes me feel unsure because i’ve asked her openly and periodically if she was okay with what we’re doing as far as affection being shown and she was 100% okay with it even after i’ve told her that i seriously want to make sure she’s comfortable with it.  

She has told me that she’s never felt so connected with and been able to feel  vulnerable  enough to share things like she has with me before. she basically was lying to me about being okay with it for months. She doesn’t want to talk about it but i fear that if im unable to create a safe space for her to communicate what she’s feeling accurately so im not unknowingly hurting her it’s not fair to myself to keep pouring love into someone who won’t ever truly feel it. I saw someone on here use a phrase along the lines of that someone who only puts a bandage on their trauma will end up bleeding on someone else. I love her so much and i really want it to work but i worry that at some point i have to put myself first and do what’s best for me because it is genuinely exhausting trying to navigate and act on what someone won’t tell me. any advice is appreciated thank you 

TL;DR - trauma is leading to girlfriend being unable to accurately communicate with me after providing a space that she (admits) feels loved and safe enough to communicate on things that are hurting her and leads to her withdrawal due to my actions hurting her even though im trying my best to cater to her needs and past trauma.",0,1763229184.0,relationships,2,0.5,False

I had almost 20 hours of travel this time- 13 hours one flight then a layover then another 6 and somehow I landed feeling calm awake and not destroyed at all.

Tea saved me on this trip.

I brought Gao Cong Shui Xian from Kong Mountain with me, brewed it right on the plane and it held me through the whole journey. First it relaxed me
then helped me drift off for a little nap. Later it brought me back with this soft clear energy without the harsh caffeine kick. And I didn’t feel that usual heavy jet lag fog when I landed.

For anyone still wondering if you should take tea with you on long flights- yes absolutely! 

My little travel hack: take an empty thermos
and right before boarding go to any coffee shop by the gate and ask them for hot water.  Sometimes they ask you to buy something small so I usually get a croissant- worth it every single time!

1oxy0tk,https://www.reddit.com/r/BigBossKan/comments/1oxy0tk/what_a_beautiful_episode_sudeep_is_a_daredevil/,"What a beautiful episode, Sudeep is a DAREDEVIL","Sudeep, a profound actor, just proved that he is a perfect BB host, the way he addressed the always plotting and problematic contestant of the house without giving a single thought about how that contestant's followers would react to it, is gutsy. Oh, no, I'm not talking about the all-perfect, the Goddess Ashwini, she's too perfect to commit any mistake. Sudeep knows how empathetic she is; he would never raise an extra decibel of his voice while talking to the Goddess. 

  
Let's talk about Rakshitha, how dare she? She deserved all that underwhelming treatment she receives from Sudeep; how dare she not be broken down even after the Goddess Ashwini tried so many times to shatter her? How dare she try to forget past issues, try to involve into the game, get past all her shortcomings like language barrier, being an easy target, yet try to play her game. Her biggest mistake? She committed a mistake of nominating a good player who didn't deserve it, the whole thing was surely unfair and stupid. BUT, this is not just a mistake its a SIN, how dare she commit a mistake like such. 

The absolute sinner Rakshitha should have chosen to be a classist, a narcissist, she could have character assasinated a woman, she could have shamelessly targeted someone that is half her age for no real reason. She could have absolutely tried to lie all her way, manipulate incidents according to her suitable narrative, tried to mentally harrass someone, tried to develop superior complex. But of all these options, the sinner choose to overthink, get overconfident about her overthinking and eventually put Raghu in nominations. Yes she accepted her mistake once she realized it but how dare she commit a mistake in first place?

The Goddess, all-perfect, deeply empathetic woman like Ashwini, she did everything she could have done to absolutely break a person just because a classless, S categorised person showed her mirror. How dare anyone show mirror to the all-knowing Goddess? She committed all mistakes in intial weeks that a random BB contestant could perform in all seasons. But my Goddess understood this game could hurt her stay in the house, she suddenly got calm, trying her best to get better after committing all possible mistakes. She was still involved in mistakes like discussing essential 'core' events like 'kalape of the week', she successfully hid coffee powder, depriving other contestants of their fair share. But hey, she is committing fewer mistakes now, so cut her some slack, please. 

Sudeep, the one who understands the core of Ashwini that she is a Goddess, is rightfully respectful towards her while confronting her, discussing her own mistakes. He is so spiritually awakened that he sometimes overlooks some deeply problematic statements, actions by the Goddess, because even her curse is a blessing to sinners like Rakshitha. Today he proved whose side he is, whose side the show is, and their format is. What a beautiful and morally educative episode. And lets not forget the feminazi Rashika trying to victimize herself after keeping random suff of a man that tried to create a narrative on her that she was romantically manipulative and interested towards him while he clearly didn't show interest. The way Sudeep gave justice to him is memorable. ",21,1763228917.0,BigBossKan,11,0.89,False

Yes, if i could i would eat out every day instead of having to cook. Yes, i would quit my job if I woke up a millionaire tomorrow. Yes, i would hire a maid if i had the money for it.

I'm a manager at a 5star hotel. The financial state if the world is below sea level. On paper i make upper class money but after paying for necessities most of the time i don't have enough money to have a cup of coffee from Starbucks at the end of the month. I work 10-12h, 5 days a week. Then the 2 days I'm not at work, one is spent doing chores. Cook, meal prep, clean, laundry, groceries. An entire day gone. I have one day, just one, to relax and have a social life. Which is close to impossible because everyone is in the same boat if not worse. Nobody has the energy or money to go out.

I want more from life. I don't even consider this living. It's surviving. I have so many hobbies i want to try but i don't have money or time for. I've never been out of my city, let alone my country and again, no time and no money to go anywhere. I want a social life. I wanna have dinner with my friends or go on a trip with them. There's so many things i find interesting but have no time for. There's so many experiences I'd love to have before my time on this earth is over.

But every time i say this people look at me like I'm crazy. Then it's followed by I'm lazy cause i want my life to be all sunshine and rainbows. Why is it so wrong to not want to work until i drop without even getting to enjoy life? If i was lazy i wouldn't even consider doing anything. I'd just say i wanna stay home and do nothing. If i was lasy i would never thought of traveling cause that's a lot of work, finding and booking a hotel, finding and booking transportation, making a list of things to do there, packing etc. i would gladly do it all. I'm not lazy. Just tired of my life having no enjoyment.

I really don't understand why it's so normalized to struggle and it's insane to want to have it easy. I'm 25(f) and I'm already tired of this bs and of people thinking I'm crazy or lazy for hating the way things are instead of acting like it's normal to struggle and have 0 joy in my life.

1oxxyon,https://www.reddit.com/r/FellowProducts/comments/1oxxyon/too_simple_for_opus/,Too Simple for Opus?,"Should I get the opus 2 grinder with upgraded burs or not? 

I’m not a complicated guy. I like coffee. Black. More often than not, I’ll like what’s handed to me to drink.  I have an aero press which I used for a while consistently after my Keuirg died. It was good. Took a little work to make coffee but it was good. Now I have an Aiden and honestly, I was nervous about telling my wife how much it was. At first I tried a few fancy coffees and I had a hard time liking the taste as I tried to dial in the settings (the ChatGPT for Aiden really helped). I finally bought some Folgers, spent time tweaking the cycles to get it where I like it and I’m happy. It makes a great cup of Folgers coffee (which is probably akin to handing a middle schooler a fancy violin and saying they sound better). 

I want to buy the grinder, sign up for drops and be amazed at the different tastes of different coffees. I worry that I won’t appreciate it, will start to resent to work to get the outcome and settle on something that’s “good enough”. I also see all the comments about the new but set verses the old one and how the new brings out specific tones of flavor but misses on the over all taste (I hope it’s obvious I have no idea what I’m talking about). 

So, there it is. I’m asking the expert community if I’m too simple to enjoy the Opus. I’m a gadget guy but I’m also someone who will abandon gadgets that make life harder than the value of the outcome the gadget produces. Thanks for reading.

Doors open at 5:00 PM — come early to hang out, play board games, and meet people before the movie starts around 6:30 PM.

We’ll be showing My Cousin Vinny, the classic Joe Pesci/Marisa Tomei comedy that’s basically required Brooklyn viewing. Marine Park Coffee will be set up like a cozy mini theater with popcorn, water, and a relaxed community vibe.

Since it’s Friendsgiving, feel free to bring a dish, dessert, or snack to share. We’ll eat together before and during the movie — a great way to try some new food and meet new folks.

The event is open to young adults ages 18–35 with a $5 cover that includes popcorn and water. Soft drinks will be available for $1 thanks to Marine Park Coffee.

Whether you’re from Marine Park, Mill Basin, Bay Ridge, Midwood, or anywhere nearby, you’re totally welcome — the goal is simply to create a fun space for young adults to meet, connect, and enjoy the night.

A [new paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.20889v3) about Maximum Weight Matching on Bipartite graphs ([assignment problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) is the most widely known problem from that category) came out a few months ago. I was really impressed with the findings of the author and decided to implement their algorithm in C#. On small 10x10 matrices, my solver achieves a **2.5x speed up** compared to [HungarianAlgorithm](https://github.com/vivet/HungarianAlgorithm), the most popular .NET solver, and as you scale up the rank of the matrices, the difference becomes even more prominent. On sparse 100x100 matrices, the new solver is **over 80 times faster:**

The solver I've implemented is available here: [https://github.com/lofcz/FastHungarian](https://github.com/lofcz/FastHungarian) (benchmark [here](https://github.com/lofcz/FastHungarian/blob/master/src/FastHungarian/FastHungarian.Benchmark/Program.cs)). It's MIT licensed, signature-compatible with HungarianAlgorithm, compatible with anything from .NET Standard 2.0 up to .NET 10 and has no dependencies outside the standard library. Newer runtimes profit from optimizations like `ReadOnlySpan<>`,`Array.Fill`, etc. The solver is [fuzzed and tested](https://github.com/lofcz/FastHungarian/blob/master/src/FastHungarian/FastHungarian.Tests/FastHungarianTests.cs) to prove correctness. Compared to the paper, I've implemented several additional optimizations that provided a further 1.3x speed up compared to a faithful recreation of their algorithm. More information on that is available [here](https://github.com/lofcz/FastHungarian?tab=readme-ov-file#algorithm-details).

‍

**Why This Pick?**

I love this pick simply because of how tragic Memphis has been overall, but particularly on the road. The Grizzlies have lost 4 of their 5 Away games, and every single one of their road losses has been by at least 13 points. The Cavaliers have won their last 5 straight meetings with Memphis, and unfortunately, the Grizzlies’ offense has taken a turn for the worse over the last 2 years (seriously, what happened?!) To boot, Memphis has yet to cover the spread as an underdog this season. For all of these reasons, I’m on the Cleveland to cover at home, friends.

My parents are avid tea and coffee lovers when they introduced me to it back in the days, I didn't find the taste interesting or something I would like to go back to.

I don't hate it but I don't like it either.
And given a choice I would choose to avoid it.

So as we all know it's like a criminal offense 🫠 to not be a chai lover and it's considered as a red flag 🚩.
And it's weird to not like coffee. 

So what's happening is that it is putting me in a awkward situation in college. People go for chai ,for general socializing etc.
So when I tell them I don't drink tea or coffee they look at me like I am a 'single-horned purple flying dinosaur'. I feel maybe their reaction is valid because I haven't met another person who doesn't like tea and coffee yet. 

So recently I have started to make attempts to try to like coffee (I would prefer it over tea pertaining to the taste). Not because of the peer pressure but because I actually want to like it.

I am just curious. Is it just me? Or there are other 'single-horned purple flying dinosaurs' like me?

Divorce. A long illness. Nights wondering if I’d ever feel steady again.
But I’m still here.
Still standing.
And now,I’m ready for a new adventure, a new life in the UAE.

I’ve been searching for months – LinkedIn, Bayt, GulfTalent, every job board.
Zero replies. Not one.(Well only from recruiters who want money to find me a job)
In this crazy-competitive UAE market, my applications vanish into the void. I've made my CV IAE ready and ATS compliant but still nothing.

Who I am.
British, 15+ years turning complex problems into working solutions
Right now: Product Owner on the UK’s £multi-billion Atlas immigration platform . 
Before that: 20 years at British Airways

Tools I know inside out: Jira, Confluence, Sabre, Amadeus, BPMN, MoSCoW, and how to keep stakeholders smiling

Languages: English (native), Urdu/Punjabi/Hindi (enough to make small talk over chai and feel at home)

Why the UAE?
Because I want to start again.
With purpose. With sunshine. With people who value hard work and second chances.
I’ve rebuilt my life once , now I want to build something new in a place that feels like the future.
But I won’t land in Dubai without a job.
I’ve got responsibilities. Trying to be realistic.
I need one door to open – one conversation, one referral, one “send your CV to my mate at xyz”.

What I’m asking
Please, if you can help, even a little, drop me a DM.
“Try this recruiter”
“I’ll pass your CV to HR”
“Here’s a job link no one’s posted yet”
I’ll reply fast. I’ll jump on a call.
And the first coffee (or karak) in Dubai is on me – the day I land with a job in hand.

1oxxf8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1oxxf8i/imitation_is_no_longer_flattery/,imitation is no longer flattery,"the word count is around 2,823 words, it’s long i apologize, just a warning.

i’m(f21) a bit concerned my friendship has become more than flattery, and is going towards more imitation than anything.

over the summer in may, i went on a 4 week school trip to greece and italy. i came there with a boyfriend, left with a totally different guy. my ex was super abusive and i dumped him four days into the trip, and got with my now boyfriend, “dallas”(m22) on one of the last days of the trip. 

we met “josie”(f19) there. she was generally a very sad person, openly said she had never been taught to be happy, and was a regular smoker. but she was good to talk to and fun to party with in europe. most of the people from the trip stayed very good friends, but me and her were particularly close afterwards.

dallas and i got together on the last night in nafplio, greece, may 28th. josie met a guy on hinge that exact same day, thought nothing of it.

mid june, josie’s nanna found her weed, alcohol, cigarettes, and vapes, kicked her out immediately. josie drove up 5 hours in the middle of the night because i told her she could stay with me when she called. 

TO PREFACE: josie had bpd, but is medicated.

throughout the 2 months that she stayed with me, we did everything together. she had money in savings, just not enough for rent, so she payed mine and my best friend/roommates, “tori’s”(f21) utility bill. she became friends with tori. dallas would call josie some nights, not realizing i was in the room to talk about how much he liked me. 

although agnostic before, she started showing genuine interest in Catholicism and began to go to my Catholic church. i play snake.io religiously, she began playing it as well. i’m a big scrapbooker, so she started to make a italy/greece scrapbook, after my encouragement. i introduced her to a few of my favorite autobiographies(little house on the prairie), my favorite movie/musical(wicked), and my favorite band (alabama shakes), even went to their concert in nashville over the summer with her and tori.

the first two things i noticed of her copying me were small and subtle. i mentioned that my one month with dallas was coming up(we don’t celebrate month anniversaries), and she says “oh mine too!”. this was odd to me because she had only been asked out officially two weeks before. i mention this and she says “oh well yeah, but we met that day so that’s our actual anniversary.” she’s wrong, but it’s her first relationship and whatever floats her boat i guess.

i also noticed in nashville that anytime we got coffee that weekend she ordered first and always got the exact same thing as me: medium iced coffee, cream and 2 sugars. now to be fair i got that from free guy(crappy movie i know), but it’s so oddly specific and i dont think shes watched that movie that it’s a little peculiar. she also said we have the same favorite song(fantasy by mariah carey, again, free guy).

i brushed all these things off, she’s younger, she probably just looks up to me. the last few weeks of summer, she moved back into her nannas because they made up on the condition that she would take a monthly drug test and her nanna got access to her banking transactions. before she left, i acted in a community theatre showing of fantastic mr fox as mrs fox. she was so enamored with the idea of acting(ive been doing it since i was 7), that she decided she was going to minor it like i do. i thought that was sweet.

here’s where it gets weird, her and her best friend, “skye”(f19), who also went to greece and italy, move in two doors down from my boyfriend(complete coincidence, truly). 2/3 of dallas’s roommates went on the trip as well and two people who went live in the building across the street from them. we all began to hang out nearly every night, having the extended group with all of our mutual friends come over and do themed house parties every saturday, it’s great. 

the problem is, i moved in with dallas soon after my birthday and he became a major focus in my life and I think she’s jealous because she’s treating him like crap when i’m not around, according to him and his roommates. she also has just become insufferable because ALL she talks about is her boyfriend. skye was crying about how her cat was sick and josie started talking about her boyfriend, for example. 

my favorite colors are lavender and light brown, and i love small floral accents. that’s how my room is decorated, that’s the color of the majority of my clothes, and the colors of all my shoes. i also collect little bear figures that i find at the thrift, as that is my favorite animal. she has a class with tori and tori said that she not only had a light brown waterbottle with white florals on it, and had a lavendar backpack(i noticed both of these things, she also used exclusively decomposition notebooks(same), had a lavendar binder, a light brown folder, and her laptop had all the stickers removed on it and was replaced with a big teddy bear sticker. this freaked me out so bad.

one day all the girls had a vision board/bucket list making girls night on a wednesday. she mentioned that she wanted to graduate a semester early and that she had changed her major from psychology. what to? communications with minors in theatre and marketing. what my degree in? communications with minors in theatre and marketing. that freaked me out so bad but i just gave her a small frown when she glanced at me to see my reaction.

we also mentioned our baby names and i said my girl will be named ophelia and my boy would be named townes or graves. skye mentioned a couple weeks later that “i don’t want kids but josie is going to have a little baby graves and i’ll just be an aunt.” EXCUSE ME??? skye got freaked out when i told her that was my baby name. that’s not a coincidence at all, graves is an odd name.

i started calling dallas my “boyf” and he started calling me his “girf” as cringy little pet names. next thing i know, she claims that her bf randomly started calling her “girf” as well.

my birthday came up in early september and tori threw a surprise fancy nancy themed party. last weekend, josie threw a “fancy and fun” themed party for her 19th…

i’m audhd(autism+adhd) and i have ocd so you could probably guess i love fidget toys. i also wear headbands and bandanas all the time. i asked her what she wanted for her birthday and she replied “headbands and fidget toys”. weird but it’s her birthday so that’s what she got from dallas and i.

in greece, skye, josie, and i all got matching tattoos and josie and i got nose piercings. i got a curly wolf cut for my birthday and got blonde highlights & bangs on my red hair mid october.

she was scrolling through pinterest the other day and apparently told skye that she wanted a “shag” haircut, bangs, and blonde highlights on her brown hair. surprise! it’s my exact same cut.

these are less weird but: i want to get a bull terrier and name it gus, josie says “aww i’ve always wanted one.”

i mentioned how i want to become more feminine and made a nail appointment and on her pinterest the next time i checked(we all follow each other on pinterest, we all look at each others account), she had a “nailspo” board when she never previously had any interest in nails

here’s where im getting REALLY freaked out. everything else was just subtle details that occurred slowly overtime. these are the “WOW this girl might want to BE me” ones.

i decided i wanted to run the nyc marathon a couple months ago and am currently 5k training. i want to have a 10k ran by the end of march, a half marathon by my 21st bday so if i can improve my time before registration for the 2027 nyc marathon takes place. i’ve been talking about my 5k i’m doing in december so often, so maybe this isn’t too weird, but she just randomly started watching the nyc marathon videos after it happened, said she always cries watching them and that she HAS to run the marathon as well, despite having no interest in ANY form of exercise prior to this and registered for the 5k without telling me and now insists i run with her.

i was trying to figure out my summer plans, like whether or not i was going to go out west to work at yellowstone with my friend who already works there, be a camp counselor & live in a convent for a month like my mom did, or study abroad again. now she’s talking about working out west and living in a convent like it’s her idea??? like i didnt literally mention it yesterday.

back to her joining theatre from earlier in the story when i still thought she was good. i ended up being in “painting and props” for the first play of the semester. josie got placed there too(no fault of her own, it was a randomizer). i was kind of excited for her to be in theatre with me, i made sure to introduce her to all of my friends. however, after just a few weeks, she started latching onto them, asking them so many questions about me, and talking about theatre being her one true passion(mind you, she’s never acted, she decided she wanted to do this in july). my theatre friends thought it was weird , but i stood up for her and said she has always loved the musical wicked and has always felt called to theatre(i was lying).

she also found out that i was trying to be the stage manager for this current play we are doing. shortly after i got the position, i found out that she immediately started convincing the director to give her a chance and let her be the assistant stage manager, which she didn’t get due to lack of experience. i have a role in mind that i want to fill in the next production my school puts on, and im fairly sure she’s going to audition for either her or the role of her best friend(im too scared to ask).

last semester, i was being ridiculously isolated by my ex. i wasn’t allowed to have friends besides tori(i refused to let her go). he caused fights between all my other friends, he made up lies to get me to cut them off, or they simply noticed the path i was going down with him and didn’t like it.

i joined phi lamb because its a Christian sorority that’s pretty cheap and would provide me with strong Christian friends, so he accepted that. it proved to be such a positive decision, i serve as the event planner now, am super close with my fam and exec, and am now getting really close with my “little”. the girls in my friend group outside of phi lamb helped me out with the big/little reveal buildup, and they all got really invested into the process and regularly ask about my little. josie ended up begging me to hangout with my big, my aunt and her little, my grand big, my twin, and my little(all these are really weird sorority terms i know). i thought nothing of this because i was under the impression that every other girl in my friend group would be attending but nope! only josie and i, plus my whole sorority family. she’s been gushing about it so much and keeps joking about me taking her as my second little or my little taking her as a little, insinuating that she’s going to join.

this last one, just cannot happen, i’m so worried. i’ve been working at a gym 20 minutes away from campus, across the state borders and into the state south of us since before the gym opened. i’ve been a manager there for so long, ive watched all the waves of people come through: my ogs, what we call 2nd, 3rd, and 4th gen workers(referring to our hiring group). i talk about my job all the time, it’s so funny to work there, everyone has a great personality and sense of humor, we can do whatever we want, and there’s so much funny stupid drama. josie quit her job out of anger and two days before she had heard me talking about how all of my friends were either stepping down, going to the military, quitting or moving away. there would only be three people from the og’s or 2nd gen. she got a big grin on her face, but got distracted by the tv right after and i never addressed it. i guess all she heard was “5 spots are open!!! apply!” because you better bet she called my boss up the next day and asked for an interview, while sending her resume in and formally applying online. she told my boss that we were friends which gets her a higher chance of receiving the job. you’re joking. my boss loves me to death, we’re basically siblings at this point, so he is more than likely going to hire her, despite not asking me if it’s a good idea and if i recommend her.

all of my friends in the friend group are genuinely so concerned. tori and i think she’s having some sort of identity crisis. skye says that she basically “imprinted” on me like freaking twilight. essentially, a lot of bipolar people have a “favorite person”. i’m truly not trying to paint bipolar people in a bad light, she just makes it so easy to make her look bad lately. 

dallas’s roommate said “she’s not a particularly remarkable person, she has no real personality or interests, she’s just you now.” i don’t think this is true. she is into horror, video games, and stranger things. i am not. i love sushi, she prefers calzones. i don’t know, she’s a sweet girl with a good heart. she clearly does not intend to hurt me. she’s not trying to steal the people in my life, she’s not bashing me to get my friends. it’s so odd bc she doesn’t seem to have any real interest in me as a best friend, she treats me as a casual friend, she says no to half of the hangouts with me or the girls. 

OBVIOUSLY she is trying to be me, i’m not dumb. i’m just wondering how far this will go? is she going to start learning gaelic? will she begin to wear bangles? is mahogany teakwood about to be her favorite scent? does she want to live in nyc? does she want to go to uvm to get her masters in wildlife preservation to be a park ranger? is she going to decide last minute that she’s going on the mission trip i signed up for?

this was mostly a vent, i just don’t know what to do. the obvious answer is to tell her that i find it weird, but dallas seems to think she will have a MAJOR crisis of self. i agree knowing her. i’m just not sure how long i can let this go on for, we’ve all tried to distance ourselves. what do we think, to the brave souls who made it this far?",1,1763227466.0,Vent,1,1.0,False

Chips or candy? The decision weighed heavily on my mind as the door to the bodega chimes. Two men walk in, fire crawling up the first’s arm while the other turns to scan the place. “Empty the register or I’ll burn this place down!” The first robber said with fiery passion. The clerk returns a flat look as he opens the register, not the first time this has happened… this week. I crouch behind an aisle hoping to leave with my wallet, not wanting to find another replacement. “Fuck! This isn’t enough, where’s the rest?” The question fills the silence with enough tension to hold even time at a standstill. “We empty the registers every night after closing and it's 5:30 in the morning.” The clerk retorts deadpan as ever with a *try again later* tone.

 Unfortunately that’s still not enough for a guy like this, it never is. The room fills with glowing ember orange light as fire now fully engulfs the thug’s arm. He pulls back his fist, willing to melt half the building when- “HEY! Uh, Stop that or…” a beat. “Or what?” The second thug turns around a smile growing at the opportunity to reap his own chaos. I stand frozen, the attention in the room now turned to me as the clerk slips through a door into a back room. *But why?*  I didn’t say that, I couldn’t have. I’m NO hero, not even at a C-rank level. Nonetheless, here I am standing on the line between bravery and stupidity, waiting to see which way I fall. 



The second moves toward me with determination, he’s already decided where I’ll land. He closes in fist ready to draw blood when- “Repel!” his fist flies back with the same intensity at which it came in. Magnetism, a power that allows me the amazing ability to lift heavy boxes and move them across the warehouse where I work. The thief’s eyes widened a bit, “He’s a powered!” The other stops melting the counter and turns toward me now as well. His smile is even wider than the other’s. He booms across the room with blazing speed and stops right in front of me. His fist flies into my chest like a flaming cannonball. The shelves don’t break my fall, they join me. They both laugh as they head towards the door. 



That’s when my own laughter softly joins. I rise along with the smoke, the hole in my shirt showing my red blistered skin. They turn again, this time the smiles are gone. “The hell you laughing at?” The powerless one asks. The voice that leaves my mouth sounds like my own, but the words are foreign, “That’s it? Ha, I thought I was gonna die! HAHAHA” The thieves look at each other and then the first launches again. He stops right in front of me, again, but this time I’m ready. “Same thing?” I ask my tone, almost disappointed. The burning bandit’s brow furrows for an instant, but it’s enough. “Repel!” I add lift to my jump as I meet him mid-air. My fist connects and this time it’s not me on the ground. The other joins back into the fight and immediately I'm overwhelmed. 



“Who the hell is this guy?” 

“Doesn’t matter, we gotta kick his ass and get out of here before real heroes show up!” They shout at each other as I stand half-dazed. I see the door, I could run, but something in me won’t let me leave. I feel like I’ve been building pressure and this is the release I’ve needed. They both close in but I welcome them, “Attract!” They trip over themselves and fall towards me. I attract a few beer cans rolling in the mess of what used to be a bodega. “Repel!” The cans fly at the thieves heads and hit with satisfying thuds. “That’s it!” The fire villain cries as he stands up with both palms together facing me. The last thing I remember is the heat. 



**Chapter 1** ***An Opportunity***



The first thing I notice is the cold nature of the hospital room, not just the temperature, but the aesthetic as well. The slow tempo of the equipment beeping and the pale white walls feel frozen. My mind is still at the bodega when the door opens. “Oh, you’re awake.” a nurse greets me “There are some men that want to speak with you” 



A few minutes pass as my mind clears and I realize where I am. Two men in black suits walk in with serious expressions. “Miles Reed, twenty years old, works at a *Smith’s Foods* warehouse in the industrial district.-” I interrupt, “Look I know I’m not licensed, but they were gonna kill that guy. I had to-” 

“Mr. Reed, this isn’t an arrest. It’s… an opportunity.” I lean in, *surely they aren’t really saying-* “Have you heard of the A-Rank hero *Vanguard*?” 

“Of course, he's one of the best heroes in Apex city.” One of the men replies, “Well he’s heard of you too and wants to help you get licensed. Even if you do manage to get a provisional you’ll only be a C-rank, but I’m sure you’ve probably guessed it will pay significantly more than *Smith’s Foods.*” 



After sitting in shock for a beat, the men offered me a card and told me to call once I made a decision. Hours have passed since then and while checking out of the hospital my phone gets a notification. I check only to see that my bank is overdrawn, again, this time to cover my power bill. I limp through the parking lot, playing the events over in my head all the way to getting knocked out.



Apparently, after I fell, Vanguard on a patrol saw the commotion and landed to investigate. He made quick work of the amateur thieves, but saw me while searching the store. It was him that brought me to the hospital and apparently he was impressed to find out I’m not licensed. He even said “Kid’s got guts to jump in like that-” and that I had *potential*. Although, I feel more like a fraud than a hero. I’ve never done anything like that before and doubt I’ll have the courage to do it again. I don’t even know why I intervened the first time.



I fumble with my keys while lost in thought, finally finding the one that opens the door to my beat up sedan that was new 10 years ago. The ride home offers only more reflection. *I could use the money* the thought echoes in my mind, leading me to a definitive decision when arriving at my door to notice a pink slip. I let out a sigh as I open the door and slump down onto the couch. The time on my phone reads 10:57pm and I have work at 6:00am the next morning. 

The alarm blares from my room blinking 5:00. I roll off the couch, the pain deeper today than yesterday. I change and take a quick shower glancing at myself in the mirror. My face mangled from the fight looks like a Picasso staring back at me. The hot water burns my wounds bringing memories of the fight back like heat flashes. 



Aside from the looks and laughs from work friends as I walk in and the floor manager complaining about my “no call, no show” the rest of the day is uneventful. Which would be normal if yesterday wasn’t the most exhilarated I have ever felt. Lift a box, move the box, set it down, repeat. I do this all day and after 10 hours, I clock out. The time on my dash is 4:37 and the card says office hours are 8-5 on weekdays.



I dial the numbers and the phone rings once before connecting. “Hi, thank you for calling the *Vanguard Hero Agency* helpline, how may I help you?” I hesitate “I-I was given a card and-“ 

“just a moment while I transfer you to our internship department.” The hold track is music interrupted by safety messages delivered from Vanguard himself, which feels oddly corporate. “Mr. Reed? We’ve been waiting for your call. I assume you’re interested in the internship?” I reply with concern, “Internship?” A beat. “Yes we can’t hire you as a hero without a license but you will be compensated for your time.”

 “I’m in.”



The next morning comes and I call in sick to work. Surprisingly I feel better this morning and even notice my injuries are already fading. I put on casual clothes since I was told “work attire will be provided” and head towards the agency.

I use my GPS to find the building since I don’t spend much time on the nicer side of town. However, what I find isn’t a building, but rather a walled compound the size of an entire block. The entrance is a gate with security checking cars as they pass through. I pull up and give the guard my name, she checks something on her tablet then welcomes me in.

I find the first open spot and walk towards the entrance to what I assume is the main building. I open the door and a wave of chaos washes over me. Papers flying, phones ringing and a dozen interns standing idle holding coffee. *Great, I'll be doing coffee runs,* I think to myself, starting to turn around. “Mr. Reed!” I turn to be greeted by the A-Rank. His presence drowns out the chaos of the room as many eyes turn to him.



“Welcome to the agency!” He says almost yelling as if making a presentation. “Follow me and I’ll take you to the hero training wing.”

 “Mr. Vanguard sir, I’m sorry but maybe this isn’t what I thought it was, but I’m not looking for an office job.” He follows my gaze to the interns, and lets out a deep laugh, “Ha Ha Ha, Mr. Reed, we have two types of interns here. There are those that print papers, grab coffee and help with *office work* and there are those that pour sweat and blood into their training in the hopes that they too can be heroes. Both are important to the work we do here, but you Miles, are the latter.” 



I follow him through hallways and around corners until we enter a large room filled with a few half sized mock buildings and other simulated environments. “This is where you will report every morning while you’re being trained. An explosion comes from the buildings as shouting starts “Ha, nice try lightshow!”

 “Take it easy, pebbles.” 

“Pebbles!? I’ll show you pebbles” a loud crash is followed by a dust cloud.



“Right, let me introduce you to your colleagues.” We make our way towards the explosions and through the dust and smoke four silhouettes appear. One flat on the ground another kneeled over gasping for air. The other two stand laughing, one chimes in “She kicked your ass again! Tough luck pebbles!” The laughing roars on. “Yeah you want some next?” Comes from the guy lying on the ground. 



As we approach they notice us and immediately they all straighten up and stand in line as the laughter is replaced by expressions that show me once again what an A-rank can do simply by entering a room. “Hello everyone, I know I don’t visit you much during training, but today I’m welcoming our newest recruit. He goes by Miles and doesn’t have a hero alias picked out yet. Unlike the rest of you he did not attend a hero university and has no combat training.” The interns’ faces widen as the rock guy chimes in, “WHAT! After how hard we had to work just to get this internship you get some guy off the street?” Vanguard nods “Also unlike you all, Miles here has seen reel field combat.” a few quiet mumbles slip about if that's why my face looks like that and the mood shifts from discontent to curiosity. “You should all introduce yourselves and show Miles to the locker room. Miles you’ll find you already have a locker with training gear inside.



The others lead me to the locker room where I find my locker and begin to change. “Hey, I'm Aurora” said *lightshow* from the fight earlier “my power lets me create light beams for powerful attacks. Mostly offensive.” The one earlier that was covered in rocks, *pebbles*, approaches “And I’m Stonewall, you probably saw my power earlier but I create armor around my body made from rocks. They tell me my power is defensive, but you get hit with a fistful of rocks and tell me what you think.”

 “Ignore him,” another calls out from across the room. Closing the distance with a flash of light. “Lightspeed, I'm quick, offense.” The final steps forward without a word, the ground rumbles his introduction instead. “My hero name is Shift, I manipulate the gravity of objects or in a field with a close range to my body. Offense and Defense. Now what about you?” 



“I'm Miles, my power is magnetism. I can pull and push objects towards and away from me like a magnet.”  Pebbles laughs “You’ll be great at grabbing and delivering coffee!” I returned, “I thought those of us training to be heroes didn’t do that.” Shift steps in “The interns that don’t pass their licensing exams get stuck in intern hell, so you better be ready because you’re about to have a whole new respect for C-Ranks.”

1oxxc3b,https://i.redd.it/cvn1h0dwfg1g1.jpeg,Down 85 lbs in 11 months,"I’ve made posts before but I’m the closest to my goal weight yet and wanted to share what’s helped me get this last bit of weight off since I had plateaued for a long time. 

SW: 235
CW: 145
GW: 130

Let’s talk tirz first and where I get it. I’m on a glp from a company called Eden. I posted my month to month transformation on my TikTok account: @KatyDoesAlot - and they saw it and gave me a link to share, it gives $100 off your first month which is nice and the same price for all the doses. I dropped the last 20 when I switched to them from the last company… idk why. 

I can’t post the link here so I stay within the rules  but it’s in my TikTok bio or if you message me I’ll send it to you. 

There were months I lost 2 lbs and felt like a failure, and months I lost 11 and it went so fast. 

But here’s what’s working:

Workouts: 2x a week, HIIT workouts for an hour. I’m SWEATING by the end of these. 

Food: I start every morning with premier protein shake, even if I’m not hungry. I’ve found it makes me no longer nauseous, and I feel really good. I have a coffee with some half and half, maybe a scoop of collagen in there 
Lunch is some tuna salad on pita or something similar 
And dinner is whatever I’m making for my daughters- last night it was cheese tortellini with red sauce. 
I drink water, and have my nightly Diet Coke. I don’t deprive myself of the treats I want, I just went on vacation and had what I wanted.

I have a little loose skin, not much. But I can tell it’s tightening up on its own as I’m building muscle simultaneously

Side effects: a little nausea, sometimes some bowel issues but nothing that doesn’t resolve within 12-24 hours. 

Ask me anything, I’ll do my best to get to everyone but I’m just so happy and confident for the first time in years and I want to shout from the rooftops if it will help even just one person 🥲❤️

# Cold Brew Basics

Cold brew coffee has grown popular for its smooth and mild flavor. It differs from regular coffee in how it is made. Understanding the basics of cold brew helps explain these differences. This section covers the key elements of cold brew.

# Brewing Method

Cold brew is made by steeping coffee grounds in cold water. No heat is used during brewing. This slow extraction produces a less bitter and smoother coffee. The grounds stay in water for hours, unlike hot coffee brewed quickly.

# Steeping Time

Cold brew requires a long steeping time, usually 12 to 24 hours. This slow process pulls flavors gently from the coffee grounds. The result is a rich, smooth coffee with less acidity. Hot coffee brews in just a few minutes.

# Coffee-to-water Ratio

The coffee-to-water ratio in cold brew is higher than in regular coffee. More coffee grounds are used per amount of water. This creates a concentrated coffee that can be diluted before drinking. The strong ratio adds to its bold flavor and caffeine content.

# Regular Coffee Basics

Regular coffee is a popular choice for many people around the world. It offers a warm, rich flavor and a quick caffeine boost. Understanding the basics of regular coffee helps to see how it differs from cold brew. The brewing method, time, and coffee-to-water ratio shape the taste and strength of your cup.

Each factor plays a role in creating the final coffee experience. These basics are simple but important to grasp.

# Brewing Method

Regular coffee is usually brewed with hot water. The hot water extracts flavors quickly from the ground coffee. Common methods include drip coffee makers, French press, and pour-over. Hot water allows oils and acids to dissolve fast, giving coffee its sharp and bold taste.

# Brewing Time

The brewing time for regular coffee is short. It usually takes between 3 to 5 minutes. This quick process means you get your coffee ready fast. The short time also helps keep the coffee from becoming bitter. The heat speeds up extraction of flavors compared to cold brewing.

# Coffee-to-water Ratio

The coffee-to-water ratio in regular coffee is balanced for a smooth taste. A common ratio is about 1 to 15 or 1 to 17. This means one part coffee to 15 or 17 parts water. This ratio controls the strength and flavor of the coffee. It avoids making the drink too strong or too weak.

# Flavor Differences

The flavor differences between coffee and cold brew are clear and distinct. Each brewing method creates a unique taste experience that appeals to different preferences. Understanding these differences helps you choose the right drink for your mood.

# Taste Profile Of Cold Brew

Cold brew coffee has a smooth and mellow flavor. It often tastes sweeter and less acidic. The long steeping process brings out subtle chocolate and nutty notes. Cold brew feels lighter on the palate and less sharp than hot coffee.

# Taste Profile Of Hot Coffee

Hot coffee offers a bold and intense flavor. It has a richer aroma with more complex layers. The heat releases oils and compounds that create a stronger taste. Hot coffee can range from fruity and bright to deep and smoky.

# Bitterness And Acidity

Cold brew is less bitter and has lower acidity. The cold water extraction avoids harsh flavors. Hot coffee tends to be more bitter and acidic due to higher brewing temperatures. This acidity can add brightness but may feel sharper on the tongue.

# Caffeine Content

Caffeine content plays a big role in choosing between coffee and cold brew. Both drinks have caffeine, but their levels differ. Understanding these differences helps you pick the best option for your energy needs.

# Caffeine Levels In Cold Brew

Cold brew coffee usually has higher caffeine per ounce. It uses a higher coffee-to-water ratio. The coffee grounds steep in cold water for 12 to 24 hours. This long process extracts more caffeine. Cold brew is often served as a concentrate. This concentrate can have two to three times more caffeine than hot coffee.

1oxx25w,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxx25w,[Trip Report] Back from 10 days in North Vietnam. Did a solo Cao Bang motorbike loop instead of Ha Giang.,"For any solo traveler craving a raw, challenging, and untouristed adventure on two wheels, Cao Bang is it. The scenery is genuinely Himalayan level epic, the roads are good, and the authentic, unfiltered moments are everywhere. It's tough, but the reward is immense.



Hey everyone,

Just landed back home from one of the most incredible trips of my life and wanted to share my experience, especially since I went a different route than most.

**About Me -** Solo traveler from India. My goal for this trip was pure adventure, to get off the beaten path, and to avoid the massive ""party tour"" crowds I’d read about.

Here's a full breakdown of what I did and what I learned. This was the final plan after a ton of research.

**Day 1-2:** Hanoi Base Camp. Flew into Hanoi. Started with a walking tour to get my bearings. The city is a fantastic blast of energy. In the evening of Day 1, I caught the Thang Long Water Puppet Show which was a unique cultural experience. Day 2 was for more exploring - Hoa Lo Prison, Temple of Literature, and just soaking in the Old Quarter vibes. On the night of Day 2, I took a sleeper bus to Cao Bang.

**Day 3-6: THE CAO BANG MOTORCYCLE ADVENTURE**

This was the main event. The plan was to go solo and truly explore. I rented a Honda XR150 from Green Riders in Cao Bang, and their help was crucial. Most importantly, I left my big backpack with them and just traveled with a small daypack strapped to the back. This was honestly the single best logistical decision I made.

**Day 1 of the Loop:**

After arriving at 5 AM on the bus from Hanoi, the Green Riders team was kind enough to let me rest and shower. By 9 AM, after a solid breakfast, the adventure began. The first day was a long and challenging ride deep into the province's western frontier on highway QL34. The road had a lot of mud, but the XR150 handled it perfectly. I reached the frontier town of Bảo Lạc in the late afternoon. My homestay that night was in the hills of Khuoi Khon, and the views of the rice paddies and mountains were just unreal.

**Day 2 of the Loop:**

The goal today was to conquer the most famous pass in the region. The route from Bảo Lạc took me east along the Chinese border, on a mix of roads like QL4A and the epic ĐT204/ĐT208. The highlight was the legendary Mẻ Pia Pass (Khau Cốc Chà). Conquering its 14 staggering hairpin bends was a pure adrenaline rush. After the ride, I reached my homestay in the Pác Bó area by lunchtime. This gave me the whole afternoon to unload the bike and explore the beautiful and surprisingly tranquil Pác Bó historical site.

**Day 3 of the Loop:**

This was a more relaxed touring day. I left Pác Bó and took a beautiful 2 hour ride south on roads ĐT211 and ĐT206 to my homestay near Bản Giốc Waterfall, arriving by noon. After checking in and taking a much needed power nap, I spent the rest of the afternoon on a light bike. I first did a proper 2 hour guided tour of the massive Ngườm Ngao Cave and then hiked up to the Phật Tích Trúc Lâm Pagoda to catch an amazing twilight view over the valley.

**Day 4 of the Loop:**

My final riding day. After a beautiful breakfast at the homestay, I checked out and finally went to the main event, the magnificent Bản Giốc waterfall. After spending a good few hours there, I began the final loop back to the city on the scenic DT207. Along the way, I hiked up to the stunning panorama at Đồi Cỏ Cháy Vinh Quý and made a stop at a traditional paper making village. My last major landmark was Angel Eye Mountain (Nui Thung). After that, I rode back to Cao Bang city, returned the bike, and took the overnight bus back to Hanoi. \[Green riders helped me book the overnight bus back to Hanoi that same night.\]

**Day 7-11:** Arrived back in Hanoi.

* **Day 7** The adventure fatigue was real. Got a 75 min sports massage. Lifesaver. That evening, I stumbled upon a fantastic night show at the Ngoc Son Temple on Hoan Kiem Lake called ""Mysterious Night."" It was an incredible, atmospheric experience with traditional music and storytelling that was way better than a standard daytime visit.
* **Day 8** Decided to go for a small-group D-Car tour to Ninh Binh. The scenery is stunning, but honestly, after the freedom of Cao Bang, the organized tour felt a bit slow. The Trang An boat ride was nice but nothing can beat the raw beauty of the northern mountain region.
* **Day 9** Visited the Women's Museum. Spent the rest of the day shopping for souvenirs (Marou Chocolate, Trung Nguyen coffee, Tired City t-shirt, bags etc). Had a great dinner at Pizza 4P's.
* **Day 10** Last day in Hanoi. The flight was in the evening so I had plenty of time. Just chilled out, did some last minute gift shopping.

# Key Insights & Advice

**1. Why I Chose Cao Bang**

This was the big one for me. I was really tempted by the Ha Giang Loop, but all the research pointed to huge tour groups and police checkpoints specifically targeting foreigners. I was looking for a proper solo expedition, not a party train. Cao Bang was the perfect answer. The roads are just incredible, and for huge parts of the ride, it was just me and a landscape that felt prehistoric. A lot of the route runs right along the Chinese border, which adds to the sense of being far from the usual tourist path. Because it’s not super touristy yet, the interactions you have with local people feel much more genuine. It felt like a real privilege to be there.

**2. Motorcycle, Gear & Logistics**

* **The Bike and Rental:** The Honda XR150 was the perfect choice for these roads. Can't say enough good things about the folks at Green Riders in Cao Bang. They were super helpful and gave me solid advice that was better than my own research.
* **Luggage Strategy:** This is a big one. I had planned to take my big backpack with me on the bike. At the last minute, I decided to leave it with the team at Green Riders. Best decision I made. For the 4 day loop, I just used a small daypack with my essentials strapped to the back. It made the bike so much more manageable and the ride way more enjoyable. Seriously, travel light on the loop.
* **Booking Homestays:** I did not prebook anything. I was worried about this, but it was surprisingly easy. Tourism in Cao Bang is still developing, so most places have room. My system was simple: find a few well rated homestays on Google Maps in the area I was heading to, and just send them a quick WhatsApp message in the morning to check availability. They always replied fast. This gave me total freedom to change my plans if needed.

**3. The Solo Experience**

It was everything. Total freedom. Stopping for 30 minutes to get the perfect drone shot of a pass. Taking a detour down a random dirt road. Eating at a tiny roadside stall because it looked interesting. You simply cannot have these experiences in a group. It forces you to be resourceful and present. For me, it's the only way to do a trip like this.

**4.  Other Random But Important Tips:**

You absolutely need cash for the remote parts of the loop, for homestays, food, and petrol. I took out a good amount in Hanoi before I left. But, I was also surprised how often QR code payments worked. I used an app called **Moreta Pay**, and was able to pay like a local at most places in Hanoi and even a few spots in Cao Bang city. So my advice is to have a solid cash buffer, but also get a QR payment app set up. It's a breeze.

The IDP situation -  As an Indian, my 1949 convention IDP is not technically valid in Vietnam. In Cao Bang, this was a non issue. I never saw a single police checkpoint targeting tourists. This is a huge advantage over Ha Giang right now. Still, it's a calculated risk you need to be aware of for insurance purposes.

**5. Food & Coffee - My Go-To Spots in Hanoi**

Hanoi's food scene is on another level. I was drinking coffee 2-3 times a day and trying everything. Here's a quick list of places that were absolute standouts for me.

* My two favourite hidden gems for a serious cup were CoC Legacy Speciality Coffee and Hanoi Coffee Stations. Both were top-notch. As a bonus, Hanoi Coffee Stations was also my go-to spot for a western brunch. For something different, you have to try the amazing salted coffee at ""Chợ Cà Phê - Cửa Hàng Cà Phê""
* I went on a bit of a Banh Mi deep-dive. Tried all the famous spots including Banh Mi 25, Banh Mi Mama, and a few others. All were great in their own way, definitely worth comparing.
* If you're looking for an authentic and delicious Vietnamese lunch, Hanoi-Oi Kitchen was a fantastic find. And when you need a break from local food, Pizza 4P's makes a seriously good pizza.
* Two things you absolutely cannot leave Hanoi without trying. First, the Cốm (green rice flake) ice cream from Kem Tràng Tiền - it's an iconic city flavour. Second, a warm chocolate roti bun from King Roti on Hang Gai.



This trip was challenging, tiring, and needed a bit of planning, but it turned out to be one of the most rewarding experiences I have had. If you're a confident rider and want a real, raw adventure without crowds, skip the usual route. Go to Cao Bang.

1oxwulo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParentalAlienation/comments/1oxwulo/seven_years_of_silence_ends_here/,Seven years of silence ends here,"
It’s been 7 years since I’ve seen or spoken with my daughters, 16f and 18f. I send cards a few times a year and recently wrote my oldest daughter a 6 page letter, which took me almost a year to write, to lay challenge to the lies that have become her warped reality.

I met my X spouse when we were 30. I had an MBA, a BMW, owned a Townhouse in the city and was making 6 figures working in a niche Wall Street investor relations position at a tech company. X and I were introduced at a company happy hour, X was a former cop turned tech bro.

I had a solid friend group of young women my age and ambition. We were all partnering, getting married and having babies together. So X felt like the right path. After a year he moved into to my townhome and since he was $25K in CC debt I let him live rent free so he could payoff his debt. Lovely wedding, though my BFF practically begged me not to marry X. She thought he was controlling and condescending. I just didn’t see it.

I got pregnant on our honeymoon. Four months later I had my first miscarriage. I say first, because I had a total of 13 miscarriages bringing my two beautiful daughters into the world. Turns out, I had an autoimmune response to placental cells and my immune system detected placental cells as cancer cells. The treatment was very complex.

My first daughter was born in July 2007. By this time, X switched jobs 3x and worked in cloud computing so his salary was around $300K. I left my good job in the city, my townhome and my friends to move to the outer suburbs. This was X’s biggest insistence. It definitely wasn’t my vibe but I participated in all the neighborhood boo bashes, backyard cookouts, bunko nights and made the best of it. I made some friends.

Two years later in July 2009 my second daughter was born. Two months early. She only spent 2 weeks in the nicu and came out breathing! X had pretty much checked out when our oldest was 9-months old. It was a very stressful 2nd pregnancy. In between the two births I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. That fatigue was crushing. X had taken up tennis on the weekends and traveled M-TH so he was never around. I was that married “single” mother who was the brunt of the neighborhood jokes. 

Honestly I don’t know how I did it. Some nights, on Thursdays when X was returning home for the weekend, he would walk right past me. Leave his roller case near the laundry room for me to deal with. Walk upstairs and never even acknowledge me. My daughters rarely spent time with him and while incredibly minimal when he did, X would always find a way to decrease their joy.

I was a great mom. 100% all the time. Mommy&Me play dates, stimulating toys/activities, swim lessons, volunteered at their preK Montessori school. I loved it. I was 37y and 39y when I had my daughters. Both my parents had passed away during this time. This was also during the housing crash in 2008 so my townhouse I had been renting went to foreclosure. It was an overwhelming time made worse by emotional neglect, then emotional abuse and in the end, psychological warfare. 

So Christmas of 2012 X tells me to take the kids, the dogs and rent an apartment in a good school district. People of Reddit…I need a Time Machine! 12/25/2012 because I did the worst thing imaginable. I fought for our family to stay together. I recommended therapy and antidepressants, and to his credit, X did both. But it was all a sham. X was fired from his $300K job in October 2013, then in November approached me with divorce. His attorney had already drafted the paperwork and I just needed to sign it. X wanted the divorce finalized by December. His terms were that X would have primary custody of our daughters for the tax write-off. I laughed in his face and wished him good luck with that.

The divorce was fully litigated. Initially X told me to use a joint CC and consult an attorney. After my attorney consultation I also asked X if I could spend $6K for a professional retraining program to assist with skills needed to renter my career. He said he’d think about it. The next day all our joint CC’s were canceled. I had no way to pay for an attorney, training, groceries or even Christmas presents. And since X was unemployed and omnipresent he began recording and filming me without my knowledge. I had a long, consistent history of self-silencing to avoid conflict so when I started standing up for myself, fighting for my children and pushing back, he claimed I was an unfit mother.

I was not an unfit mother but the basis of his claim was that I drank wine in the evening when my children were asleep. I did, and you know what, I enjoyed it so much! It was time to call family and friends, decompress and finish the last of my chores before bed. I was definitely self-medicating, however, it did not make me an unfit mother. 

I had a small investment account pre marriage that had enough to keep the litigation process going. A Guardian Ad Litem (GAL) was hired. This is a neutral attorney hired to represent best interests of the children. I had stopped drinking at this point, but X pivoted to my nightly use of Ambien as another example of addiction. I took about a dozen drug tests and had a hair follicle test done and every single one was negative for alcohol and whatever else they test for. Meanwhile, X had been abusing pain pills for four years and never had to take any drug tests. When the GAL was pressed on this she said X “now has a legal Rx for opioids so it’s a non factor.”

As I would later learn, the GAL was a men’s right attorney. No, that information wasn’t publicly disclosed. When my investment account ran out and I couldn’t afford to pay my attorneys, they motioned to withdraw…leaving me without representation. At this point the court bifurcated financials and custody. After a very stressful 6months of X living in the marital residence, he moved out and began paying alimony. Custody was split. And he was suddenly employed in a high paying job again.

By now it had become painfully obvious that X was trying to avoid paying approx $3K/monthly child support. Timed unemployment, dependent tax write off, unfit mother claims, etc. Despite his high earnings X was never good with money. He took a 10yr interest only mortgage on our marital home and had only paid the monthly interest. That note was now due. He was also $50K+ in credit card debt. 

It didn’t matter. The GAL’s recommendation for X to have primary custody was the final judgement. I had every other weekend visitation rights and nightly phone/video calls. From a stress, anxiety and depression standpoint…everyone was miserable except X. He enrolled the girls in a new school, always in ASP, weekend activities, sleepovers or with babysitters. My daughters were miserable and my oldest began cutting herself while at her dad’s. 

X foreclosed on our family home, filed bankruptcy and was financially anew again. I paid him child support. X garnered a lot of attention portraying himself as a domestic abuse survivor whose spouse was some version of a crazy alcoholic. It would’ve been comical had I not been suffering from prolonged stress. It was much. 

I developed ptsd. I struggled for 2yrs trying to reenter my career, but a 10yr gap in finance/tech led nowhere. Eventually in late 2018 I couldn’t afford electricity or rent and spent 7months unhoused. During this vulnerable time, X blocked me from my children’s phones and refused to let me see them. He removed them from every activity (because I knew where they would be) and never told me. If I wanted to speak with my children I had to schedule it through X and he would record the FaceTime call. He refused to let me see them. He threatened a restraining order if I ever appeared at his house. He literally kidnapped my children and began brainwashing them. 

X remarried in 2018. A divorced mom with two daughters, a little older than mine. I met them. They had good manners and honestly they seemed like great kids. I even liked X’s new wife, whose ex-spouse was an anesthesiologist and had set her up in an upscale home in a golf course community. So while I was homeless they were blending their happy families together at her home and X used this as an opportunity to obliterate me from their lives. Suddenly my youngest daughter was terrified of me. My oldest was extremely anxious. I was blocked from their phones and when I would request a F/T call via X, he’d say they didn’t want to talk to me and he hopes I get the help I deserve.

So all ties were cut. I never saw or spoke to my daughters again. I ended up living with a longtime acquaintance in her hoarder/share home. I trusted her and rent was cheap. I had been walking dogs for extra income and by the time I moved into the share house, I had nothing to lose. I started my own dog walking business and as it turns out, I have a really good head for business! Hired my first employee in 2022 and another in 2023. Our revenue last year was over $200K. I know it’s not wildly impressive, but it sure beats where I started from. 

A couple years ago my friend/roommate ran into X and my daughters at a local Mexican restaurant. She was able to get my oldest daughter’s cell number. From there I reconnected with my oldest, who’s now 18y. Online only. About a year and a half ago my oldest D sent a late night Snapchat message wanting to get together for coffee, I agreed then she ghosted. It’s been a slow process and she’s been very apprehensive overall. We follow each other on IG, mine is a business account and hers is personal. A few texts.

So the 6 page letter. It’s basically a longer, more detailed but gentler version of this post. My oldest D received it in August, confirmed, but has ignored a couple messages I sent asking if she wanted to share her thoughts or get together. Silence. 

There’s a lot of shame being the Target parent, especially as a mother. The power, control, coercion and deceit constantly weighing on my thoughts. And the helplessness. Not having the means to fight for my children and being plunged into poverty. Clawing my way out of it. 

This is my first post about parental alienation. I want to break the cycle of self-silencing when my emotions feel too big. I want to hug my daughters, assure them they’ve always been loved to the moon and back and I’d appreciate your encouragement, wisdom and kindness for a path forward.

Or a plan for a plan. It was better than the less than scraps that I had.

We piled into my car. I had to apologize for the empty White Castle slider containers in the passenger seat, sweeping them onto the floor before he got in. 

Nolte didn't seem to care, digging out a cigarette and tucking it between his lips before a lighter magically appeared in his hand. It was slightly amazing and he did his little bit of magic again after he had the cig lit.

He took a deep pull that must have burned fifteen percent of the cancer stick and slowly exhaled.

“You mind?” he asked, belatedly, his head mostly lost in a cloud. He cranked down the window.

“No,” I said, repulsed and intrigued at the same time.

Odious. The word came to me out of the blue. My mother used to give me a new word per day one summer when I was on break. That had to have been over thirty years ago. It fit Nolte *perfectly.* 

I pulled into my complex a few minutes later and I found a spot right in front of my unit.

We got out and I took the lead, tossing my keys until I had the right one. I managed to drop them twice at the door before I got it open.

My place was typically kept clean and it was a momentary shock to see the state I'd left it. Nolte made his way to my dining table. He swept all my stuff onto the floor. Most of it was junk mail that I just hadn't thrown away, but a dish broke and I heard the remote smash open and double-A batteries went skittering across the tiled floor.

Nolte took a rolled up sheet of paper out of his jacket pocket. It looked old. He spread it out on the table--it wasn't anywhere big enough to warrant a table clear. I had a spot he could have used with room to spare without doing all that.

The paper had coffee stains, singed corners, dirty fingerprints, and an amorphous red splotch I prayed was strawberry jelly.

He'd drawn the layout of the bar in pencil. Said writing utensil appeared in his hand just like the lighter had. He put two X's next to the bar.

“This is us,” he said, tapping between the X's. He dragged his finger to the door we wanted to get through, then circled the room behind it.

“Thirteen-by-nine,” he said, with that settling growl. “Except, I have it on good authority anyone who goes inside will say it’s much... much bigger than that.”

“On good authority from who?” I asked, crossing my arms.

Nolte dug into his jacket pocket and dropped two photographs on top of the drawing. I could make out a hand, but my brain couldn’t process that it was a human being. There was a leg in blue jeans, a foot, torso, some jagged red stuff at the top.

“Oh, shit,” I said. It was like all the parts assembled to make a human being. *Most* of a human being. Something big had taken a chomp out of everything above the collarbone plus one shoulder.

“He was a confidential informant of a kind. Hammond put me onto him before he died. He'd been in the room, least he said he had. I think more than likely, he knew someone who had and was relaying everything secondhand. But secondhand is better than no hand.”

A bottle and a white cloth appeared in either of Nolte's hands. He screwed off the cap and doused whatever the liquid was onto the cloth. Then he held it up to his mouth and nose and took a deep breath with his eyes closed.

“Is that... is that chloroform?”

He doused the rag again and held it out to me.

“No,” I said, putting my hands up in mock surrender. Nolte shrugged and put the cloth back to his face. He hobbled a bit, but held his feet.

“What we need to do is... is find somebody else who's been in there.” Nolte slurred his words. “You said you go to that bar a lot?”

I hadn't said that, but he wasn't wrong. I nodded.

“So you know the staff. That Shorty guy. He didn't wanna talk around me. Maybe we go back and you go in alone. See if he can get you in. But you gotta make sure. Make sure he knows you mean the other room, not the supply closet or whatever the hell it is when it's not that.”

He put two fingers on the table as if to balance himself. His eyes were distant and his pupils were large.

“I think I can do that. But, he may wanna know why I'm back so soon. I don't usually go there so early, and definitely not twice in one day.”

“Make sum'n up. You forgot your keys, lost your dog. I don't know what the fuck!”

He was definitely agitated. I remembered just then I didn't know anything about this guy other than he *looked* like a cop. 

He took a really long time to put the cap back on the bottle, then missed his inside jacket pocket several times as he tried to tuck away his works.

“Look, I'm sorry. It's just I'm so close.” Nolte shook his head. “You...” He pointed at me, his eyes slowly starting to focus on something on the table. “You're puttin’ me close. I can feel it.”

As close as I was getting him, I remembered I had my own thing going on.

“I'm looking for something myself,” I said. “Maybe it's related. Maybe not.”

Nolte nodded. I noted he didn't ask me what my thing was. He was a one-track minded man.

“Hey, you wanna go in the bedroom, fool around a bit?”

“What?” He'd just jumped that track.

“Need to clear the pipes. Help us think.”

“*No*.”

“It's not a big deal. Look, I haven't looked another human being in the eye in over seven years. Man, woman?"" He shrugged. “A hole is a hole for me.” The look on my face told him I wasn't sold. “I'll turn over for you, too, if you want.”

The fact I wouldn't have been special was offensive for some reason. And why did he think that *I* would have been the one who--

“I'm thinking pretty clearly right now. I'll take a bow on that note.”

He looked at me center chest for a long moment.

“Then I need to use your bathroom.”

He breezed past me and closed the bathroom door behind him.”

“Aw, Christ.”

Nolte took a rolled up sheet of paper out of his jacket pocket. It looked old. He spread it out on the table--it wasn't anywhere big enough to warrant a table clear. I had a spot he could have used with room to spare without doing all that.

The paper had coffee stains, singed corners, dirty fingerprints, and an amorphous red splotch I prayed was strawberry jelly.

He'd drawn the layout of the bar in pencil. Said writing utensil appeared in his hand just like the lighter had. He put two X's next to the bar.

“This is us,” he said, tapping between the X's. He dragged his finger to the door we wanted to get through, then circled the room behind it.

“Thirteen-by-nine,” he said, with that settling growl. “Except, I have it on good authority anyone who goes inside will say it’s much... much bigger than that.”

“On good authority from who?” I asked, crossing my arms.

Nolte dug into his jacket pocket and dropped two photographs on top of the drawing. I could make out a hand, but my brain couldn’t process that it was a human being. There was a leg in blue jeans, a foot, torso, some jagged red stuff at the top.

“Oh, shit,” I said. It was like all the parts assembled to make a human being. *Most* of a human being. Something big had taken a chomp out of everything above the collarbone plus one shoulder.

“He was a confidential informant of a kind. Hammond put me onto him before he died. He'd been in the room, least he said he had. I think more than likely, he knew someone who had and was relaying everything secondhand. But secondhand is better than no hand.”

A bottle and a white cloth appeared in either of Nolte's hands. He screwed off the cap and doused whatever the liquid was onto the cloth. Then he held it up to his mouth and nose and took a deep breath with his eyes closed.

“Is that... is that chloroform?”

He doused the rag again and held it out to me.

“No,” I said, putting my hands up in mock surrender. Nolte shrugged and put the cloth back to his face. He hobbled a bit, but held his feet.

“What we need to do is... is find somebody else who's been in there.” Nolte slurred his words. “You said you go to that bar a lot?”

I hadn't said that, but he wasn't wrong. I nodded.

“So you know the staff. That Shorty guy. He didn't wanna talk around me. Maybe we go back and you go in alone. See if he can get you in. But you gotta make sure. Make sure he knows you mean the other room, not the supply closet or whatever the hell it is when it's not that.”

He put two fingers on the table as if to balance himself. His eyes were distant and his pupils were large.

“I think I can do that. But, he may wanna know why I'm back so soon. I don't usually go there so early, and definitely not twice in one day.”

“Make sum'n up. You forgot your keys, lost your dog. I don't know what the fuck!”

He was definitely agitated. I remembered just then I didn't know anything about this guy other than he *looked* like a cop. 

He took a really long time to put the cap back on the bottle, then missed his inside jacket pocket several times as he tried to tuck away his works.

“Look, I'm sorry. It's just I'm so close.” Nolte shook his head. “You...” He pointed at me, his eyes slowly starting to focus on something on the table. “You're puttin’ me close. I can feel it.”

As close as I was getting him, I remembered I had my own thing going on.

“I'm looking for something myself,” I said. “Maybe it's related. Maybe not.”

Nolte nodded. I noted he didn't ask me what my thing was. He was a one-track minded man.

“Hey, you wanna go in the bedroom, fool around a bit?”

“What?” He'd just jumped that track.

“Need to clear the pipes. Help us think.”

“*No*.”

“It's not a big deal. Look, I haven't looked another human being in the eye in over seven years. Man, woman?"" He shrugged. “A hole is a hole for me.” The look on my face told him I wasn't sold. “I'll turn over for you, too, if you want.”

The fact I wouldn't have been special was offensive for some reason. And why did he think that *I* would have been the one who--

“I'm thinking pretty clearly right now. I'll take a bow on that note.”

He looked at me center chest for a long moment.

“Then I need to use your bathroom.”

He breezed past me and closed the bathroom door behind him.”

Danish and Feroze don’t even play this type of character. 
I hadn't seen grey characters from Danish and Feroze. Because they are playing only one-dimensional characters. Unlike Bilal is known for playing grey ones.

Your people are also not familiar with grey or shady characters.
If they were portraying such a role, it would have been completely different.. they would either kidnap the girl or her father/brothers, or even kill them.

He burned the car, yes, and that was a very reckless and over the top reaction…
But even then, he allowed himself to be beaten to get something out of the situation, and he never crossed any extreme limits.

He was also apologizing.
And he brought the car back again to fix the situation.

If Danish or Feroze were the ones who got slapped, things would’ve gone in a completely different way.. they would’ve absolutely taken revenge for their ego and honor.

Even when he drank coffee and wanted to stop Haniya, he only held her purse, he didn’t touch her hand.
He ""is"" harassing her, yes, but he’s doing it within certain ""limits"" and trying to act cute or charming.

He spent the whole night outside. The girl’s family involved the police, and he himself confessed to his wrongdoing in front of them. He was even beaten, a nurse helped him, and he has apologized many times.
He only wants friendship, but since the girl is refusing, he should step back.

So the better way would be for him to send his family with a marriage proposal, and that’s what he will do in the upcoming episodes.

And as for those who say he’s changing just because of one slap, and that’s more like Danish’s behavior.. It’s not true. Because he has been looking for a girl from the very beginning. But every girl he met seemed impressed only by his wealth and fame.
And anything that comes easily loses its value.


Even Danish and Feroze are now acting like somewhat ""decent guys."" 🙂

1oxwklt,https://www.reddit.com/r/stuffyouneeddaily/comments/1oxwklt/why_is_my_smart_plugs_overheating/,Why is my smart plugs overheating?,"Hey everyone,

So I've been dealing with this issue lately and figured I'd share what I learned because it's actually kind of important for safety reasons.

If your smart plug is getting hot, you need to figure out why pretty quickly. I'm not trying to scare anyone, but overheating can lead to some serious problems if you ignore it.

**Here's what usually causes smart plugs to overheat:**

First off, you might be plugging in something that draws too much power. Most smart plugs can handle around 15 amps, but some appliances like space heaters or hair dryers pull way more than that. I made this mistake with my coffee maker and found out the hard way when the plug got crazy hot.

Another common problem is using a damaged plug. Check if the prongs are bent or if there's any melting on the plastic. If you see that stuff, throw it out immediately. It's not worth the risk.

Poor ventilation is also a big deal. If your smart plug is stuck behind furniture or in a tight spot where air can't flow, it's gonna heat up. These devices need room to breathe just like anything else electronic.

Sometimes the outlet itself is the problem. Old or loose outlets don't make good connections, which creates resistance and heat. You can test this by plugging the smart plug into a different outlet and seeing if it still gets hot.

**What you should do about it:**

Stop using the plug right away if it feels hot to the touch. Don't mess around with this because electrical fires are no joke.

Make sure whatever you're plugging in doesn't exceed the power rating. Read the label on your smart plug and the appliance. If you need to run high-power devices, you might want to check out some higher-rated options at [https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) where you can find plugs designed for heavier loads.

Give your plugs some breathing room. Don't stack them or cover them with anything. Keep them exposed to air.

Replace old or cheap smart plugs. I know it sucks spending money, but quality matters with electrical stuff. The cheap ones from random brands often use inferior components that can't handle normal use. I learned this lesson after going through three different brands that kept having issues.

If you've tried everything and your smart plug still overheats, it's probably defective. Most decent brands have warranties, so contact the manufacturer. Or just grab a new one from a reliable source like [https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs](https://goodhomedeals.com/smart-plugs) and call it a day.

**Bottom line:**

Smart plugs are super convenient for home automation and controlling your devices remotely, but they're not invincible. Pay attention to warning signs like unusual warmth, burning smells, or discoloration. Your safety is way more important than convenience.

1oxwj2c,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1oxwj2c/astaxanthin_doesnt_give_you_energy_like_caffeine/,"Astaxanthin doesn’t give you energy like caffeine, it helps your cells make more of it.","Look, I love my coffee. But it wasn’t until I started my journey as a nutritionist that I actually understood why relying on it felt like a trap. I’ve seen this sub talk about it often, so wanted to add my 2 cents.

Caffeine hides tiredness, it doesn’t fix it. That’s what pushed me to explore actual energy support and astaxanthin made sense. Astaxanthin works at the mitochondrial membrane, integrating into both phospholipid layers. It quenches singlet oxygen and peroxyl radicals right where ATP synthesis happens, specifically at complexes I and III of the electron transport chain.

If caffeine is like hitting the gas pedal harder, astaxanthin is like tuning up the engine so it runs smoother and wastes less fuel.

What people miss is the membrane stabilization. When mitochondrial membranes are compromised by lipid peroxidation, proton gradient efficiency drops and you generate more ROS per ATP. Astaxanthin spans the entire bilayer and protects from both sides, so your mitochondria run cleaner and more efficiently.

From my experience, I’ve seen clients who train regularly respond especially well to it. Better post-workout recovery, less wired fatigue, and improved endurance over a few weeks of consistent use.

The studies focus on lactate threshold and VO₂ max, but clinically I see better phosphocreatine recovery between sets and lower creatine kinase post-training. There’s also evidence it upregulates PGC-1α, signaling mitochondrial biogenesis. You’re not just protecting mitochondria, you’re building more.

Dosing: Most of the research uses 4 mg -12 mg per day but 4 mg is a solid, evidence-based starting point. Because Astaxanthin has a long half-life (around 16 hours), consistency matters more than mega dosing. Taken daily, it builds up gradually over a few weeks, providing steady coverage without peaks or crashes.

I still drink coffee for the ritual, but my HRV stopped tanking on rest days after adding Astaxanthin. That’s the difference between masking fatigue and supporting recovery at the cellular level. 

Genuinely curious to hear others experience on the particular effects of astaxanthin on energy.

An executive action signed in mid-November temporarily exempts dozens of products from higher “reciprocal” tariff rates, after months of criticism that earlier duties were contributing to cost-of-living strain for U.S. households. The changes do not remove all trade barriers but reduce or suspend some of the steepest surcharges on foods that the administration says are not produced in sufficient quantities domestically.

According to summaries of the order and trade analysts, the rollback follows a series of new agreements with partners such as Argentina and several Central American countries, which included commitments on market access and agricultural imports. Economists say the impact on grocery bills is likely to be gradual rather than immediate: import contracts, shipping schedules and retailer pricing cycles mean shoppers may only notice price changes over weeks or months, and some items may not fall in price at all if other costs remain high.

Supporters of the move argue that dialing back tariffs on everyday staples is a pragmatic response to voter frustration with inflation that has lingered even as overall price growth slows. Critics counter that the episode illustrates how trade policy swings can themselves add uncertainty, with producers and importers struggling to plan around shifting duties. They also note that many non-food tariffs remain in place, which could limit broader price relief.

The decision adds a new wrinkle to the broader debate over how much trade policy should be used as a lever on domestic prices versus as a tool for negotiating with foreign governments. For consumers watching their grocery receipts, the question is simple: will they actually feel a difference at the checkout line.

I’m a 19(M) year old student. A year ago, I met a 24(F) year old woman who was teaching me German. At first, it was just normal “student–teacher” interaction. But over time, the way we looked at each other changed.

She noticed small things about me, laughed a lot when I was around, kept catching my gaze. When she stopped teaching my class, I finally asked her out. She didn’t hesitate and gave me her number right away. We had a great evening together: coffee, a walk in the park. It felt like the perfect beginning.

But then things got confusing. She would pull me close, then suddenly disappear saying she was too busy. She said she only wanted to be friends, yet acted like so much more: hugging me, texting “good night, my love,” talking about the future, about trips we’d take together. I wanted to trust it, but the uncertainty was destroying me. I lost 5 kg in the first month from stress alone.

We eventually started seeing each other more often, about 1–2 times per week. I gave her small gifts and paid for restaurants when I could, even though I lived very modestly. She opened up to me, shared personal things. It felt like we were inches away from becoming a real couple.

After visiting her parents abroad, everything shifted again. She came back, we became closer, and we kissed for the first time. She told me she had mentioned me to her parents. Their reaction was extremely negative: she comes from a very religious Muslim family, while I’m Christian. For her, that conflict was huge.

Just when we finally reached real closeness, everything collapsed. The reason was something small: I planned to get coffee with a girl from my language course who simply wanted to hang out. I don’t see her in a romantic way at all. I recently moved to Germany, I’m introverted, and I’m just trying to make friends. But my girlfriend saw it as betrayal. She texted me that we should break up.

I panicked and ran around her neighborhood, trying to find her place. Eventually, I saw her at a tram stop. She was with another man who looked stronger and more confident than me. I still approached her, gave her flowers, hugged her. She introduced me to him as “just a student” and called him her best friend. They got off together at the next stop. She threw away the flowers as soon as I left.

Later, she said it was all too much: her parents were pressuring her, she was angry at me, and she couldn’t go against her family no matter how strongly she felt about me.

For a couple of weeks after the breakup, we still talked, but then she started pulling away harder and harder. Now she responds after 24 hours, her words feel cold and empty. She hasn’t texted first in five months.

It’s been half a year. I finally decided to stop. I want my life back, to not depend on someone who has already left. But her image still haunts me. Some nights I lie awake thinking maybe it really was fate.

I still don’t know what we had.
Was it real love?
Or was I just a temporary comfort while she didn’t want to be alone?

My go to is a Grande Latte at Starbucks is 16 oz. If I understand right it’s 2 oz espresso and then 14 oz steamed milk. 

How do I replicate this at home? Using Vertuo Plus and double espresso pods, so 2.7oz espresso. Also using aeroccino, I fill to the max line for hot milk, using extra creamy almond milk. Which is 4-5 oz. Coming out to about 10 oz in the cup. 

The obvious option for a larger drink is to do 2 batches of steamed/frothed milk. But the drink already doesn’t taste all that strong to me so this seems like it would be even weaker coffee taste.

I tried doing a double brew of the pod to get 5oz espresso but then I was jittery all morning from double the caffeine. (I just pressed the button again when it was done brewing the first time, is there some other way to do this?)

What else am I missing? Should I try a shelf stable milk instead for better froth?

1oxw9b0,https://i.redd.it/ziac5n9d8g1g1.jpeg,What will our relationship end up being?,"
I (F) met this guy in mid September at a mixer. I found him overwhelmingly attractive, and I thought I was picking up signals that he was interested. We texted a little bit, then met for coffee earlier this week. I asked this horary before I coffee, and the horaries I’ve asked since the coffee have all said it’s not yet time to ask about this again. So, this is still the horary that describes what we are headed toward. 

I’m Sun in Scorpio in the 4th, he’s Saturn in Pisces in the 8th. In this chart, I took the moon to be performing multiple functions: it’s a co-significator of the question, it gives some context on our current relationship to each other, and it is a co-significator for him as well since it’s in the 7th. The Moon in Aquarius, to me, shows we don’t know each other/there isn’t familiarity/and someone has a neutral or detached sense of the other person or what’s coming together. The Moon applying to trine Venus in Libra in the 3rd suggests that what is coming is a fun, light, intellectual, or casual interaction, perhaps with some flirting. The Moon is in Venus’ bound, which gives it some reception where it would otherwise be peregrine. To me this says that there is a level of attraction that is helping someone overcome the otherwise pretty neutral feeling that comes with interacting with someone you don’t know super well. This application also brings in matters of the 3rd and 10th. 

Venus squaring Jupiter in the 12th is what’s confusing me. I think the Moon carrying the light from the Sun (me) to Venus (the basis of what is coming up) is activating that square, which would also bring in topics of the 5th, 8th, and 12th. 

Some interesting things: the coffee conversation reflected this chart. There was a good amount of flirting, but also mixed signals. He’d situate himself close to me and then pull away and I did the same. With Venus at the IC, we talked about growing up in the same religion/faith tradition, and with Venus ruling the 3rd and 10th, we talked about me having recorded a podcast before I met him and about career. I also word vomited about a dream I had about a celebrity (I know) and definitely thought he thinks I’m insane and never wants to see me again. That’s Mercury in its fall opposite Uranus, and ruled by a 12th house exalted Jupiter. With Saturn in the 8th as his ruler, he talked about almost being free from student loans. 

With no other charts being available yet (a chart I casted after the coffee basically said wait to ask again until after Mercury rx is over), I’m using this one and wonder if it just describes the coffee or our longer term deal. The luminaries are angular and fixed, and the benefic of sect is super dignified and angular. Taking it all together, I’m assuming it means that at a minimum, we’ll stay connected even if we don’t continue getting to know each other. Even though Venus is what we’re moving toward, I’m not sure it’s romance so much as affinity/a basic “like”. Would love other interps!!!!",1,1763224723.0,horary,1,1.0,False

My petty complaint: this subreddit no longer feels like a place for actual petty complaints

I used to love coming here to vent about stupid little things — cold coffee, slow WiFi, neighbors who mow at 7 a.m., getting the middle seat on a flight, whatever. Just harmless, low-stakes whining to blow off steam.  

Lately though, 9 out of 10 new posts are some variation of “Trump did/said X and now I’m mad.” Same template, same talking points, same comment section patting each other on the back. It’s not even creative whining anymore; it feels like reading a scripted feed.  

That shift annoys me because:  
1. The sidebar literally says “petty complaints only.” Political megathreads belong in the politics subs.  
2. When one topic drowns out everything else, the sub stops being relaxing and starts feeling like every other polarized corner of Reddit.  
3. If the front page were 90% identical posts complaining about Kamala Harris or AOC, people here would (rightfully) call it brigading or bot activity and demand it get cleaned up. The double standard is glaring.  

I’m not asking for politics to be banned; I’m just asking for balance so the sub can go back to being the dumb, cathartic complaint box it’s supposed to be. That’s my petty gripe today. Thanks for reading.",0,1763224693.0,complaints,41,0.4,False

The CM6360 is $1599.00 CAD. Reg $2999

My home set up is a 12+ yr old breville duo temp pro and a breville smart grinder. I could never get consistent results and my shots were always sour or bitter so I just make americanos and it helps even them out. 

Question is- will this machine be a good upgrade for the price? Will it still struggle with consistency? And lastly, is it reliable? The reviews are mixed. 

Thanks so much. ",1,1763224612.0,superautomatic,5,1.0,False
1oxw7ih,https://www.reddit.com/r/Divorce/comments/1oxw7ih/i_thought_we_were_gonna_be_alright_finally/,I thought we were gonna be alright finally.,"Hi everyone. Hope you’re all doing alright. This is my first post on Reddit but I just kind of wanted to talk and hear that it is gonna be fine I guess. 

Me and my wife have been married for 9 years but separated for the last 2ish. We had a good first year or two together but after the birth of our daughter things got really shitty really fast. My wife had a complication with the pregnancy and couldn’t work for almost 2 years, and we were young without good jobs so I was making very mediocre money trying to support a new family. I won’t go into too many details but we both had no financial awareness. Constant money troubles led to constant fighting. Constant stress and anxiety just led to a lot of resentment etc etc  This went on for years… way longer than it should have. I switched jobs a couple times but she was going to school. We were just always broke and barely making it. 

A little under 2 years ago she asked me to move out. We were both in a better place I thought. I had just gotten a really good job that pays more than double what I was making before. She was finishing up her degree but she just said she needed time alone to figure things out and that she didn’t feel the same as she did before. We worked out a system where I gave her X amount because I made much more than her and we would live in separate apartments. I thought she met someone but it turned out she really did just need time to heal. I followed suit and went to therapy for a year. I lost 65 lbs. Got a promotion at work making money I never thought I could make. Playing guitar all the time. I felt really happy and she did too. She also had gotten a good job and was spending a lot of time doing things she loved. We were both in a better place. 

A few months ago she casually mentioned that she had joined a dating app and wanted me to know. She said it wasn’t anything serious and that her and her friends were just kind of messing around one day and downloaded it together. We were both focused on ourselves for the last 18 months and when I moved out I kind of just expected that it was the end so it bothered me less than it should have maybe? She did end up going on a few dates and would tell me about them and eventually decided that all men sucked lol. Upon her realization of that we kind of slowly started talking again. We were both in a better place and happy. We went on a few dates, spent a day together at a national park, I even stayed the night a couple times. I started bringing her coffee/food to her workplace at times. We spent a few entire weekends together. We were seeing each other on a daily basis. Our daughter was getting excited that she might be able to live with both parents again. It was really great. 

And then early last week there was this coldness that seemed to come out of nowhere. She maintained distance from me. I went to hug her at one point and she gave me this little half side hug thing. I went to pick our daughter up and she just felt very distant. It’s been racking my brain and yesterday as she was typing in her phone to show me something some guy named Matt messaged her. I couldn’t read the whole message but he mentioned spending time with her the day before. He had little kissing emojis at the end. She told me she was working overtime at her job. This was kind of weird to me because part of the reason I married her is because she was always so honest with me. She is a terrible liar and even laughs at herself about it. She quickly swiped up to get the message off the screen and side eyed me to see if I saw it. I asked her if he was the reason she had been acting differently the past couple weeks. She started getting teary eyed and then told me I just need to do it. I said, do what? She said, this isn’t something I want anymore. I love you but I don’t want to try with you anymore. 

I already did all the divorce stuff 2 years ago you know? I struggled for a couple months, then started kicking butt, going to therapy, exercising, all that stuff that you would hope would make amazing strides. But now it feels like I got punched in the gut again. I’m not giving up or anything but I had started to think this was going to be another chance. Maybe a happy future. We weren’t fighting. We both make good money now. we went on nice dates and spent some good time together. I’m grateful for that but I guess I started thinking it was all gonna be ok from now on. You can’t fix 9 years of fighting in a few months but now with apparently some other guy and her creating distance it feels like I’m back where I started 2 years ago. I’m replaying events and fights in my head again. I just want things to be ok and I know they will, but this is one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to deal with. My daughter asked me today that if we all move back in together, could we get a puppy? Man, I don’t want to have another conversation with her about it. It’s so difficult.

I found a different recipe that didn’t call for coffee it may have been original thing. It may have been somebody’s personal recipe that had it in there, but I’m just curious I did ask one of my other friends who was a member and she agreed with me that she would not use a recipe that had that in there, but I just kind of want to get everybody else’s opinion.",1,1763224589.0,latterdaysaints,26,0.57,False
1oxw74w,https://v.redd.it/20oo7irk7g1g1,Rogue Signal Protocol - Cyberspace stealth roguelike (with AI dev workflow),"Hey r/roguelikedev!

I've lurked here for many years and attempted creating several roguelike games in the past to no great success. However, today I've just released **Rogue Signal Protocol** (v0.8.0 Alpha), a traditional turn-based coffee break stealth roguelike (that's a mouthful!) where you play as an escaped digital consciousness navigating hostile corporate networks. Quick 10-15 minute runs with permadeath - each death teaches lessons, each run reveals more truth.

*(Screenshots in comments)*

# Core Features:

* **Deterministic gameplay (no RNG)** \- Pure skill-based tactical decisions, no luck involved
* **Enemy movement prediction** \- See each enemy's next 3 planned moves for tactical planning
* **3 procedurally-generated network levels** with 8 unique enemy types, 13 exploits, and distinct AI behaviors
* **Dual rendering modes** \- Switch between graphical sprites or classic ASCII glyphs

# What Makes It Different:

**Enemy movement prediction** shows you each enemy's next 3 planned moves - no guessing, pure tactical planning. It's like playing chess against enemies who show their next moves. Use this intel to slip past patrols, set up ambushes, or plan your escape route.

The **stealth mechanics** are central - you're not meant to fight everything. Hide in blind spots to avoid detection and manage your heat levels carefully. Push your detection too high and the **Admin Avatar** spawns - a powerful boss with perfect tracking and relentless pursuit.

**Heat management** from exploit usage and bump attacks adds another resource layer beyond typical HP/mana. Every move counts in this purely skill-based tactical challenge.

The **story is told through environmental fragments** \- 20+ story fragments persist across runs, even death can't erase them. Each run might reveal new pieces of the Project Chimera conspiracy. Permadeath for your character, but persistent narrative discovery means every run brings you closer to the truth.

The game features full audio with atmospheric music and 40+ sound effects, particle effect explosions for enemy death, and complete keyboard and mouse support. Track your progress across runs with the **Achievement System** \- unlock challenges and prove your mastery of stealth tactics.

# Where to Get It:

**Itch.io:** [https://dragynrain.itch.io/rogue-signal-protocol](https://dragynrain.itch.io/rogue-signal-protocol)   
**Source Code:** [https://github.com/Dragynrain/RogueSignalProtocol](https://github.com/Dragynrain/RogueSignalProtocol)   
**Feedback Survey:** [https://forms.gle/jbwGdn8VGPa6NG9p9](https://forms.gle/jbwGdn8VGPa6NG9p9)   
**Youtube Link:** [https://youtu.be/URI75uHpOOc](https://youtu.be/URI75uHpOOc)

This is **alpha 0.8.0** \- feature complete and playtested, now looking for wider feedback on:

* **Difficulty** \- Is it too easy? Too hard? Fair but challenging?
* Stealth vs combat balance and overall fun factor
* Any bugs or edge cases I missed

**Bug reporting made easy:** Hit Shift+F12 or use Settings > Export Debug Package to create a comprehensive debug report (saves, logs, metrics, system info, screenshot). Makes bug reporting super simple!

# How This Was Built

**Background:** I'm a professional software engineer, so this was built with engineering discipline: architecture reviews, code quality standards, and comprehensive automated testing.

This game was built with the assistance of AI tools (Claude Code for code, Stable Diffusion for sprites and images, AudioCraft for SFX), compressing the timeline from probably 6-12+ months to closer to 3 months. I did use some wonderful human-created music for the soundtrack!

I approached this project more like a technical project manager: breaking down requirements, reviewing architecture decisions, curating outputs, and ensuring quality. This is my first project with AI. I definitely learned a lot about coding with AI assistance and how best to use Claude Code and how to maximize my time spent on the fun things like designing game systems!

**The reality:** I approached asset generation with most of my time spent on quality control - only keeping outputs that fit the game's design vision. Thousands of sprites and images were discarded before settling on the ones I did. AI definitely accelerated the prototyping and iteration cycles, but game design, architecture, balance tuning, and quality standards were all human-driven. **The tools amplified my output, but the creative direction is all human.**

There's a Graphics Preview option in the main menu that has dozens of sprites I created and lets you preview them together (walls, floors, enemies, player, etc.) to see how well they match, which is how I chose the default sprite set. I'm not a real artist by any means though! If you think you can do choose better from among my sprites send me your set (the previewer will actually save what you have chosen to a log file).

If you are an actual artist or actual sound designer interested in improving the game's polish, I'd love to collaborate. Reach out!

**Testing Infrastructure:** This game is supported by a massive testing infrastructure to alleviate the need for as much manual testing.

* **2000+ automated tests** \- 1000+ unit tests, 1000+ integration tests, 50+ agent-based gameplay tests
* **GameTestAgent framework** \- Headless game simulation where AI agents actually play the game to validate mechanics
* **Specialized test agents:** Chaos agents (spam random inputs to find edge cases), speed-running agents (test optimal pathing), pacifist stealth agents (ensure non-combat paths remain viable), barbarian agents (pure combat validation)
* **Parallel test execution** with custom per-worker file isolation - runs the full suite in under a minute
* **Automated regression testing** \- Pre-commit hooks prevent broken code from entering the repository
* Catches mechanical bugs and edge cases that might not surface in manual playtesting

I learned so much more about testing methodologies, processes, and patterns building this all out!

**Technical Stack:**

* **Language:** Python + TCOD 19.6.0 (latest!)
* **Dev Environment:** VS Code on Windows 11
* **Testing:** Parallel test execution with headless game agents, per-worker file isolation, pre-commit hooks
* **Runtime:** Windows standalone EXE (\~200 MB download)
* **Play Time:** 5-15 minutes per full 3-level run
* **License:** MIT (free and open source)

**Happy to answer any questions about the workflow** \- what worked, what didn't, where AI helped vs. where it fell short, or anything about the development process. And of course, would love feedback on the game itself!

I feel like the game is way too easy in its current state and I want to ratchet up the difficulty and add an Ascension system and gamepad support. But I also wrote the game and know how all the systems work so of course it feels easy to me!

1oxw5hl,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxw5hl,The Scam of Prophecies,"Do you smell that? It's Saturday, it's raining, it's cold… time to sit in a bathrobe, drink some hot chocolate because coffee makes me dizzy like alcohol… and just… venture into the world of “what the hell is gonna happen! Eventually!”

E V E N T U A L L Y.... keyword

Prophecies!! arguably the one job a prophet absolutely has to get right. I mean, it’s built right into the title. Prophet. Not “historian"" not “moral influencer"" not “ancient life coach"" You’re supposed to prophesize. And when we look at how religious arguments go today… somehow prophecies have been pushed into the storage room with the broken Christmas and Ramadan ornaments.

Why? How did the main test for divine revelation turn into the thing no one wants to talk about?

Because look.... every religion has its “scientific miracle” claims (all wrong), its “historical accuracy” claims (also wrong), and its “this book explains reality” claims (still… wrong). So what’s left? Prophecies.

The big promises! The receipts!

The part of scripture where we’re supposed to see the divine hand at work… except,.… we don’t.

【Hi everyone I’m Ajima Vivi! The guy whose posts and comments you apparently read in Conan’s voice. Grab a snack, grab your reading glasses, grab your Pokémon plushie because this is-】

- Prophet? It ain't Pro, nor fitting.

Get it? Because Prophet is also... nvm

See, when you peel back the glittery layer of religious storytelling, you start noticing something interesting: ancient prophecies look way less like divine predictions of the future and way more like the ancient equivalent of political speeches mixed with therapy. They’re ambiguous, poetic, metaphor-filled, symbolic… and they almost never map neatly onto real history.
And that’s not a coincidence.

Prophecies weren’t written to predict the future... they were written to control the future by shaping how people acted in the present. That’s why so many of them read like:

“This kingdom is totally going to fall any day now!”

“A great ruler will rise… eventually… later… sometime… don’t rush me.”

“The end of the world is coming soon™.”

""Send Ajima Vivi all the money you have""

Prophecies needed to be just specific enough to sound impressive, but vague enough to last longer than milk. And when they failed? Easy: reinterpretation, metaphor, “actually that means spiritually,” or “oh, we meant the second coming.”
But we’ll get to that.

If you’re religious, this is going to be a little uncomfortable. If you’re not, it’s going to be hilarious. And if you’re a scholar of ancient Near Eastern literature, you already know where this is going and you’re probably scrolling too fast... slow down!

- The Ancient Art of Saying Things (Styrofoam flavored)

So before we dive into the great buffet of unfulfilled prophecies across Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, we need to understand something very, very important:

Prophecies aren’t just vague... They’re strategically vague.

And if that sounds too conspiratorial, don’t worry! scholars aren’t saying prophets were malicious... they’re saying prophets were human. Humans with agendas, fears, political pressures, theological worldviews, and the same coping mechanisms we all use today. Except instead of “the universe has a plan,” they said “YHWH/Jesus/Allah told me this will happen.”

And sometimes? They were just wrong. Factually, historically, verifiably wrong.
But religions can’t exactly staple an errata sheet to the Bible or Qur’an, so when reality does that awkward “not matching the prophecy” thing, believers don’t say:

“Oh, that prophecy failed.”

No no no... nah uh

They say, ahem ahem...

“You misunderstood it.”
“It’s metaphorical.”
“It’s actually about the end-times.”
“It’s spiritual, not literal.”
“Ah, see... it will happen… eventually.”

Prophecy is basically the ancient world’s version of ""Retroactive continuity""

And nothing shows this better than Christianity’s greatest hit of misinterpretation:

- Matthew’s Virgin Birth! When a ""Misquote"" Becomes Doctrine

Matthew 1:23 famously claims that Jesus was born of a virgin because the prophet Isaiah predicted it centuries earlier:
“Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son…”

Except Isaiah… didn’t say that.

Isaiah 7:14 in Hebrew says the Hebrew word “almah,” which means young woman or maiden but NOT.... virgin.

If Isaiah wanted to say “virgin,” he had the word ""Betulah"" which appears plenty of times in the Hebrew Bible.

But Matthew wasn’t reading Hebrew.
He was reading the Septuagint, a Greek translation where “almah” was rendered as parthenos, which can mean virgin but also just means young woman.

So Matthew uses a translation error……to prove a prophecy……that wasn’t a prophecy……about an event that already happened in Isaiah’s own lifetime.

Isaiah 7 predicts a child to be born in the 8th century BCE, as a sign for King Ahaz during the Syro-Ephraimite War.

The child is born later in the same chapter. Isaiah even talks about him growing up.
Matthew does what religious apologists still do today:

grab a verse out of context, reinterpret it, and retrofit it to a new narrative.

This is exactly how prophecy works in every Abrahamic religion.

- Judaism: When the Prophets Go “Any Day Now…” for 3,000 Years

Judaism is full of prophecies that read like someone’s doomsday predictions from 2008 that they refuse to delete.

Let’s go through the greatest hits! Rapid fire up in this bit-

- Ezekiel’s Prophecy about Tyre (Ezekiel 26–28)

Ezekiel confidently declares that Nebuchadnezzar will:

 destroy Tyre
 scrape it clean like a rock
 make it never be rebuilt

Problem:

Nebuchadnezzar didn’t destroy the island part of Tyre.

Alexander the Great did some damage centuries later, but Tyre survived.

Tyre kept thriving for centuries.

Tyre still exists. You can visit it today.

Ezekiel literally backtracks later:

“Okay fine, Nebuchadnezzar didn’t get Tyre. God will give him Egypt instead.” (Ezek. 29:17–20)

This is the prophetic equivalent of saying:
“I wasn’t wrong, I was just… early.”

- Ezekiel on Egypt (Ezekiel 29–32)

Ezekiel predicts Egypt will:
become desolate for 40 years

be completely uninhabited

have its people exiled and scattered
Actual history? No... like just no... Egypt did exist continuously since forever and Archaeologically? no sign of depopulation.

Historians be like... yeah no.

- Daniel’s “Predictions” (Daniel 7–12)

Daniel predicts history… perfectly… right up to a point.

That’s because those parts were written after the events happened.
But then Daniel tries to predict the future beyond 164 BCE and… misses everything.
The king he describes (Antiochus IV) did not die where Daniel says.
The final kingdom of God did not arrive.
Daniel is the textbook example of vaticinium ex eventu “prophecy after the fact.”

This was due to the fact that people thought Daniel lived in the 7th century BC (around 650) but he didn't... he actually lived around 160 BC, the 2nd century... and we can confirm this too by his language usage, he didn't even speak 7th century BC Hebrew, he spoke a more modern version.

To make this easier for you? Imagine a Hadith being read in a 2025 TikToker Lebanese woman living in Amman accent. 

Yeah, obviously not something written a long time ago.

- Zerubbabel’s Non-Kingship (Haggai 2)

Haggai claims Zerubbabel will become God’s chosen king.

Zerubbabel becomes……a governor under Persian rule.... buuuuut No throne.... No dynasty.... Nothing...

———————
And before we even get any further... we need to acknowledge something most people never hear in churches.... a lot of prophets in the ancient world weren’t lone mystics receiving divine radio signals (insert wolf sigma howling image lol)... they were court employees... yeah like a 9-5 shit.

Like… literally staff. Advisors. Political hype-men.

Take Ezekiel and Daniel, for example. These guys weren’t wandering ascetics shouting inconvenient truths to the powerful. They were living under imperial rule, writing from inside the very systems they were supposedly “warning” 

Ezekiel spends half his book praising King Nebuchadnezzar as God’s chosen instrument.... which is exactly what you’d do if your entire survival depended on convincing the guy you weren’t a threat.
And Daniel? That book reads like ancient royal fanfiction:

“Oh mighty king, please enjoy this extremely flattering vision about how every empire after yours will crumble except the one my God likes. Also, can I keep the nice clothes?”

Modern scholars (like Dan McClellan, Lester Grabbe, John Collins, and other biblical-historians-who-do-this-for-a-living) point out that many prophetic texts served political agendas, offered reassurance to rulers, or were crafted after events to retroactively give legitimacy to kingdoms and leaders. In other words:

Prophecies as PR... 

which is really funny to me because Prophecies start with P and R... and so... nevermind...

When a prophet’s paycheck came from the palace, you can probably guess whose future they were predicting.

- Christianity! The World Was Supposed to End Yesterday

Christianity begins as a failed-apocalypse movement. Like the hail mary comet cult... 

That’s not me being edgy, that’s mainstream scholarship.

- Jesus’ “This Generation” Prophecy

Jesus says the world will end within the lifetime of his listeners.

Cosmic signs/Angels descendin/Son of Man coming in the clouds/End of the world

“THIS GENERATION will not pass away until all these things happen”

We are now 2,000 years past “this generation""... I mean come on, 2006 gen legally driving? God I'm old...

Unless Jesus meant “this generation… of tortoises” or ""Plastic""

Believers today reinterpret:

“Generation means race!” (no such thing btw)

“Generation means future people!” (Absolute BS)

“Generation means the generation that sees the signs!” (Every generation apparently did... and all signs were wrong)

No...

The word ""genea"" in Greek means “the people alive right now.”

Jesus expected an imminent apocalypse.
It didn't happen.

Christianity just adapted (pushed it under the rug)

- Paul Thought He’d Live to See the End

Paul literally says:
“WE who are alive at the coming of the Lord…”

Not “those in the future.”

“We.”

Paul himself... like it doesn't get any MORE clearer than this!!!! No room for interpretation, show me the end of the world baaaab-

he died... shi-

Jesus didn’t come... And no end of the world happened, I still gotta work and study. 

- Revelation Predicted Rome Would Fall Soon

Revelation is basically Jewish apocalyptic fanfiction about Rome collapsing and Jesus showing up any minute. (GET USED TO ROME FALLING PREDICTIONS!)

Rome’s timeline:

• Still standing for centuries.
• Fell in 476 CE, long after John's audience.
• Not in the way Revelation describes.

Modern Christian reading:

“It’s symbolic! It’s future! It’s about Europe! It’s about microchips! AND 5G!!!"" 

Ancient context reading:

“It’s about Rome. The actual Rome""

- The Matthew Trick (Again) Prophecy by Creative Editing

Early Christians did this constantly.
Matthew:
“Jesus going to Egypt fulfilled prophecy!”
Actual “prophecy”:
A verse in Hosea… about Israel’s exodus… not about a messiah… not predictive.
Matthew:
“Jesus living in Nazareth fulfills prophecy!”

There is no prophecy about a messiah living in Nazareth. Matthew just… made it up.

Christianity is basically built on reinterpreting old texts to make them look like predictions.

- Islam: Apocalyptic Soon™ and Guess-the-Conquest

Alright, buckle up, because if you’ve ever wondered why Islamic apologists keep pointing to vague “scientific miracles” and “numerical patterns” instead of, ya know.... actual predictions, it’s because the predictions that did exist… aged about as well as milk in the Medina sun.
So here are some Islamic prophecies... not end-times stuff, not “Rome will fall again"" just regular everyday assurances.... that didn’t exactly land the way they were advertised.

Again, this isn’t my opinion; this is mainstream Islamic historiography, actual academic scholarship, and a basic understanding of how time works.

- “Medina Will Never Be Hit By Plague!”

Ah yes, the ancient Arabian equivalent of “This product is waterproof.”
The hadith literature (Sahih Bukhari and Muslim.... big names, not the bargain bin stuff) proudly declare:

“Plague will not enter Medina.”

Early Muslims took this literally: Medina is God’s VIP section. No plague allowed.
Turns out…

Medina got hit by multiple epidemics!! cholera, fevers, outbreaks during Hajj seasons and Ottoman medical records happily confirm it. The city had significant deaths during various epidemics throughout history (COVID?? Hello?) 

Let's do the classic religious move:

“Oh, well, when the Prophet said ‘plague,’ he didn’t mean plague plague.
He meant Only That One Specific Plague™, and everything else doesn’t count.”

It’s like claiming your house is “fireproof” and then saying, “Well technically it was electrical fire, not, like… fire-fire""

- “The Muslim Community Will Never Unite on Falsehood!”

Have you ever met two Muslims on Twitter who agree on anything?
This prophecy... also in early hadith says:

“My ummah will not agree upon misguidance”

Which is adorable!!!! because Islam historically split faster than a K-pop fandom... or the Twilight Fandom, are those still alive? Team Jake?!! Hello?
Where was I? Right.. Islam:

• Sunni
• Shia
• Ibadi
• Mutazila
• Ashari
• Athari
• Ismaili
• Sufi orders
• Kharijites
• Ahmadiyya
• Quranists
• And the eternal “my personal YouTube sheikh is the only real Muslim” sect

And much more....

If the Muslim community is never wrong, then which community?

Each one calls the other misguided.
This prophecy is like saying, “My group chat will never disagree.” Bro, your group chat is the disagreement.

Modern Youtube comment:

“The prophecy refers to scholarly consensus”

Oh, cool.... so now you’ve narrowed it to, like, 12 guys who all contradict each other too.

- “There Will Be Twelve Righteous Caliphs From Quraysh”

When your prophecy gives you a number, but history gives you an Uno reverse card.

Hadith in Sahih Muslim says:
“There will be twelve caliphs after me, all from Quraysh.”

Nice and specific! Easy to know what the hell he's talking about in here right?

Yeah absolutely nobody in Islamic history matched this list.

Sunni scholars:

“Okay, maybe it’s the first four. And… uh… some Umayyads? Ignore the tyrants. And maybe a few Abbasids? And stop counting when you hit twelve.”

Shia scholars:

“It’s the Twelve Imams!”
None of whom ruled anything except hearts and theology exams.

Modern scholars:

“…This was almost certainly political rhetoric written after the fact.”

Religious teachers:

“I genuinely have never heard this hadith in my life""

Reddit Muslim debaters: 

""بشوفها وبرجعلك""

- “The Arabian Peninsula Will Have Only One Religion!”

Then immediately didn’t... wow this one didn't even age at all, this prophecy got aborted... fetus deletus! 

There’s a hadith... widely used in legal rulings in Saudi Arabia btw... stating:
“There shall not be two religions in the Arabian Peninsula”

Early Muslims understood this as:
Islam will completely dominate Arabia.

History man says:
• Christians lived in Najran and Yemen for centuries.
• Jews lived in Medina and Khaybar long after Muhammad.
• Trade cities were religiously diverse.
• Today the Gulf has millions of Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, and atheist workers.

Modern instagram reel justification:

“Well… it means no two publicly practiced religions.”

Or:

“It only refers to the Hijaz region.”

Or:

“It refers to citizens, not residents.”

The prophecy keeps shrinking like a wool sweater in the dryer... (I need help, I tried to wash some of my winter clothes and now they are my younger brother's property)

- “Islam Will Reach Every House on Earth""

The door-to-door marketing prophecy!!! Sales agents where you at? 

Tradition says Islam will reach every household. Early Muslims understood this as empire expansion... that Islam would literally rule the world.

But after the first century, the empire stalled. Large regions stayed non-Muslim. Whole civilizations remained untouched for 1,000 years.

Modern.. what your mom sends you on whatsapp: 

“It means everyone will hear about Islam.”

Ah yes!!!! the ancient prophecy that one day humans will invent Wi-Fi....
Truly miraculous.... even tho some humans still don't know anything about any of this.

- The Conquest of Rome (Everytime... it's always Rome)

The Qur’an and hadith predict the Muslims will conquer:
• Persia (did happen after Muhammad)

• Constantinople (did happen, but 800 years later)

• Rome... Never happened

Modern apologetics (youtube sheikhs):
“Well, it’s symbolic!”
“It means Rome spiritually!”
“It means America!”

No.

It meant the actual Roman Empire...

- “God Will Protect the Kaaba From Anyone Who Tries to Harm It”

Except for all the times it was harmed.

The Qur’an and early tradition describe the Kaaba as divinely protected. Like a sacred Fortnite shield bubble (Don't play with me)

History, however, disagrees:
• 930 CE: The Qarmatians sack Mecca, steal the Black Stone, and dump bodies in the well of Zamzam.
• 683 CE: Kaaba burned during a siege.
• 2020: Hajj shut down entirely due to a global outbreak.
• Multiple historical periods where pilgrims literally couldn’t reach Mecca.

Modern... what your uncle says at a wedding:

“This means spiritual protection, not physical""

Okay, then why did early Muslims think it meant physical protection?
Because it very obviously reads like physical protection.... what is a spiritual protection? Is it? I mean it's not, I'm pretty sure there is still sin there. 

————————————

- Why Do All These Prophecies KINDA Look the Same?

Because prophecies across Judaism, Christianity, Islam, follow the same pattern.

- Political Rhetoric

Prophecies weren’t meant to predict... they were meant to control.
“God will punish your enemies” = “Support the king/priest.”

- Written After The Fact (Vaticinium ex Eventu)

If you describe past events as predictions,
it makes people trust your real predictions more.

Daniel does this openly.

Revelation does it symbolically.

Islamic eschatology borrows from late-antique Jewish & Christian apocalyptic models.

- Poetry > Accuracy

Prophecies use dramatic metaphors.
Great for sermons.

Terrible for literal timetables.

- Conditional Prophecies

“God will do X unless you repent.”
If X doesn’t happen?
“Good job, you repented!”

Built-in escape hatch.

- Crisis Literature.

Prophecies respond to trauma.
Invaders, war, famine, exile.
People want hope, not accuracy.

- Infinite Reinterpretation

The more symbolic a prophecy is, the harder it is to disprove.

Religion survives by updating definitions.

- Apocalyptic Urgency

The ancient world was chaotic.
End-of-the-world predictions comforted people.

——————————

- In Conclusion...

So what do we do with all this?

Well… nothing dramatic. I’m not saying ancient people were stupid, or evil, or running some 4D theological Ponzi scheme. I’m saying they were human!

Beautifully, disastrously human. They did what humans always do... try to make sense of chaos. Try to find patterns. Try to believe tomorrow will make more sense than today.

Prophecy wasn’t a telescope into the future it was a mirror held up to the present. A mirror for fear, for politics, for hope, for trauma, for national myth-making, for emotional survival. And when you read it that way... not as divine weather forecasts but as ancient psychology and poetry?

suddenly everything clicks. Suddenly the contradictions make sense, the failures make sense, the endless reinterpretations make sense.

Once you stop treating prophets as cosmic meteorologists and start treating them as human writers living through real historical crises, the whole genre becomes less mystical, but far more interesting. It becomes literature. It becomes anthropology. It becomes the story of us! scared primate apes staring at the sky and insisting there must be a plan when there isn't.... it's just being lost and trying to find an answer.

And maybe that’s the real revelation here.

Thank you for reading, and have a good rest of your day.

1oxw4yf,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstory/comments/1oxw4yf/the_influencer/,The Influencer,"I sit in my bedroom in so much disbelief that I, Camila Cortez, a small content creator, was invited to spend time with the biggest Latina creator across all social media apps, Tati Moreno.  I keep thinking this is a prank.  My jerk of a boyfriend laughed when I told him about the invitation.

 

“Cami, be fucking for real, why would they invite someone with less than ten thousand followers?” He barked out a laugh, and I flipped him off.

 

“Why are you so mean? “I snap.  “I don’t know why I was invited, but this could be a fantastic opportunity for my travel vlog and my content. Anyway, if this is real, do you want to come with me? Steve, we need to figure out what’s going on with our relationship. Being away from here could help and change our perspective.” I say, and he shrugs.  

 

 

My phone chimes with a message from TikTok. It’s from an account called El Conjeo, no one knows his real name. He is a friend and we have chatted about our content through messages. He is an advocate for the Latino community, but he does it humorously. He also wears a black rabbit mask; no one has seen his face.  Unlike me, he has over one hundred thousand followers.

 

**El Conjeo: Yo, chica, did you get an invitation to Tati’s thing?**

 

**Cami\_mami: Yes, is it real?**

 

**El Conjeo: Yes, it’s real. I just got an email with all the information and rules. All that shit. Check to see if you got the email.**

 

 

I look at my email and boom, there it is:

 

Dear Cami,

 

We are beyond thrilled to invite you to stay at Tati’s home for the week to learn, collab, and network with other influencers. This year, we have handpicked all our guests based on the content you make, not their followers.  We are all here for the same reason: to bring our Latino culture to the forefront and show what we can do! We will pay for you and a guest to fly to Los Angeles. We will have drivers pick you up at the airport, but the location will remain a secret. The rules are listed below.

We look forward to spending time with you!

 

1.        PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM THE WEEK UNTIL YOU LEAVE.

2.        WE ARE HERE TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES AS SUCH: NO MASKS ALLOWED

3.        YOU ARE FREE TO ROAM THE HOUSE, USE THE AMENITIES, BUT PLEASE STAY OFF THE THIRD FLOOR.

 

Thank you,

 

Greg,

Manager of Tati Moreno

 

“OMG! It’s real, Steve!” I screech. He rolls his eyes at my excitement.

 

“When is it?” He asks.

 

“In two weeks, do you think you can come?”

 

“I guess,” he says.

 

“Don’t sound too excited,”  I say, leaving the room.  I don’t know why I try with him, but we have been together since we were sixteen, and we are twenty-one. He has changed a lot, and I don’t like who he has become. He’s mean. I know what I need to do, but I’m scared.

 

 

Two weeks later, we are on an airplane from Texas to Los Angeles. I love to travel and make content about my travels.  I sit on the plane with Steve, and he is fidgeting all over the place, and it’s starting to annoy me.

 

“Are you okay?” I ask.

 

“No, actually. I uhhhh,” he starts and stops.

 

“Can you just tell me?

 

“Okay, I made a mistake, a big one.” He says, looking at me and then at the floor.

 

“What did you do?”  I say in a shaky voice

 

“I cheated.” He says

 

“You what?  You cheated?” I ask. Somehow deep in my heart, I knew he was doing something. “With who?”

 

“Lucy,” he says in a whisper.

 

“Lucy, your boss, Lucy! The one who comes to our apartment for game nights, Lucy?” I whisper-shout. The lady next to Steve looks at us and quickly turns away. He nods. He fidgets some more, “Is that all?”  I ask, and he shakes his head. “Spit it out, Steve?”

 

“She’s pregnant.” He says. I know this is over, and it’s been over for a long time, but this hurts. A lone tear falls down my cheek. He goes to grab my hand, and I pull away. “Cami, babe.”

 

“Don’t babe me, Steve, you checked out of this relationship a year ago. Be honest. I was the only one fighting for us.”

 

On our flight, we sat side by side in silence. I cried silently for something that I have already been mourning, but it is now real, and it cuts deep.  If I am being real, I have had a crush on someone I have never met, but I would’ve never thought to cheat on Steve.  We grab our bags and find a man holding a sign that says ‘Welcome Cami Cortez and Steve Castro.’

 

“Hi, that’s us,” Steve says, trying to grab my hand. This time, I let him.  He leads us to a black limo SUV with all the windows blacked out. We get in, and Steve tries to sit next to me, and I move. “We need to talk about this, Cami.”

 

“The time for talking was when you felt like being with another bitch,” I snip.

 

“Is there any fixing this?”

 

“No, we haven’t been in a real relationship for over a year, Steve. We have not been intimate in over six months.  It’s like we are roommates, nothing else.  You don’t love me, Steve.”

 

“Do you love me?” he asks

 

“How long have you been cheating?”

 

“Answer my question,” he demands.

 

“Answer me,” I yell.

 

“Over a year.” He snaps.

 

“ A year! I have been fighting for us! I loved you with everything I had.”

 

“You loved me? As in past tense?”

 

“Yes, I am realizing that now. I had false hope, and you made everything clear. So no, I’m not in love with you. Yes, I have love for you, but I will never love you again. There is no fixing this.”

 

We finally get to our destination, and since the windows were all black, we could not see out of them. We have no idea where we are, but we see the massive house, and it’s stunning. We are greeted by a man dressed in slacks and a white button-up shirt. He is handsome with his salt-and-pepper hair. He has his hand outstretched, and I take it to shake.

 

“Greg,” he says, shaking my hand, and then he shakes Steve’s hand.

 

“I’m Cami, and this is Steve,” I say.

 

“Tati sends her apologies, she will not be here until tomorrow night, her flight got cancelled coming from Barbados.”

“Oh, no worries, I say.

 

“We have lunch ready, and we have some of the others here already.” He leads us into the vast house, and my goodness, it’s gorgeous, all white and black tiles: high vaulted ceilings and pillars. He leads us to a large room with tables set up with food and drinks. “Help yourself to food, and your bags will be taken to your room. If you need anything, please let me know.”

 

We get plates and fill our plates with a little bit of everything they have to offer. We find a table, and Steve looks at me expectantly.

 

“You don’t want to work this out?”

 

“No, that is something you can’t fix,” I say, trying not to cry, but I lose the battle and cry.

 

“Wow, I make one mistake and that’s it?”

 

“It was a huge mistake. I’m done.” I wipe my eyes.

 

“You’re a fucking bitch,” he spits. Greg comes up and looks between the two of us.

 

“Everything okay?” he asks.

 

“I think I need to leave,” Steve says.

 

“Yeah, I think you should,” Greg says. I will arrange a ride back to the airport, but you will need to pay the fee to change the flight.”

 

“Fuck this shit, “ Steve yells.

 

“Okay, let’s go,” Greg says, leading him out of the room. I look down, and I feel the tears start to fall. Not because I’m sad about Steve cheating, but because he humiliated me in front of a room full of strangers. I look up and see a guy looking at me  and he starts to walk over. He looks like a young Pedro Pascal.

 

“Cami, are you okay?” he hands me a tissue. I look at him again it and dawns on me who he is.

 

“El Conjeo?” I ask. He nods and grabs my arm to help me stand up. He envelopes me in a hug so tight I squeak out and laugh.

 

“Call me Pablo,” he says.  “Whatever is going on, I’m here if you want to talk. Let’s finish eating because they are going to give us a tour of the house. Can I sit with you?” My heart is pounding because my crush is actually hugging me, and he’s gorgeous.

 

I fill him in on what happened, and he is very sweet, listening to it all. Talking about it makes me see that this relationship ended ages ago.  He told me that he is glad that I’m seeing what pendejo Steve was. He told me I deserve better than that because I was worthy and beautiful.  There were many other people in the room, and we were lost in our own conversation. The room was full of loud laughter and chattering. An older woman walked in; she was wearing a black ankle-length dress, modest but very modern. She emoted sheer elegance. She cleared her throat, and the room went silent.

 

“We will be starting the tour now. Each of you has a color on your pamphlet, given to you when you arrived, which will be your group for the week. I turned my pamphlet over and saw a red dot on the back, and I looked over at Pablo, and he showed me a red dot as well.  He gives me a thumbs up and smiles. We go and find our fellow red dots. “Red dots will be with me.”

 

I look around our group and see all the other creators that I recognize, and I get so excited to be here.  The old woman takes us from room to room, telling us the history of each room. She hasn’t told us her name, which is a bit odd to me.  Her eyes look familiar to me. Pablo and I think that she is Tati’s mother or grandmother, as they have similar eyes.  She leads us to a room with Tati's family history, including many photos of the family and a family crest featuring a black Aztec bird. It is the same tattoo I have on my clavicle. I see out of the corner of my eye Pablo pulling up his sleeve, and on his wrist, he also has the same tattoo. Our eyes meet, and I pull down my top slightly and show him mine. I see the old lady looking between us, and it creeps me out. A man comes in with a tray of tiny glass cylinders filled with a blue liquid.

 

“Let’s say a cheers to everyone who has come to join us this week,” the old woman says. Everyone takes a cylinder and coughs after drinking it, except Pablo and me —we drink it without a reaction.  Greg and the old woman share a look, unnoticed by everyone but us. I look at Pablo, and he stares right at me, and he shrugs. “You are dismissed to your rooms to freshen up if you would like.”

 

We go up the marble staircase, and it screams rich. I would never be able to have this, but would I want it?   Maybe not.  Turns out Pablo and have rooms right next to each other. Each room has its own bathroom. Pablo comes into my room, looking confused.

 

“Hey, does your bathroom have a mirror? He asks. I look in my bathroom, and there isn’t one. I come out and shake my head. “How the fuck am I gonna be able to shave my face without cutting myself. I look around the room, and there isn’t a mirror in there either.

 

“There are no mirrors in the room either.” I go back into the bathroom, and this time Pablo follows me. “There are lines on the wall showing where it was.  This is weird.”

 

“The old woman is creepy, right? He asks.

 

“She kept,” I start.

 

“Staring at us.” He finishes.  I nod. We go out into the hall, and Janet, one of the other content creators, comes out of her room looking confused, too. “No mirrors?

 

“Yes, but there are also these triangle things on the windows, so when the window curtain is open, it shines on the wall and floor.”

 

“What?” We say. We go into her room and see the triangles on the floor and wall. I run into my room and see a star, and Pablo runs back to his room.

 

“I have a pentagram thing. I am freaked the fuck out.”

 

“Me too.” I am petrified. Greg walks up and startles us.

 

“We would like you to be downstairs in about an hour for drinks and games.”

 

“Greg, why are there no mirrors in the rooms?” Janet asks.

 

“The previous owners didn’t believe in them because they hated vanity.”

 

“I thought Tati’s family owned the house?” Pablo asks. I notice that Greg looks irritated.

 

“Yes, her great-grandparents didn’t like the mirrors.” He says. With that, he walks away.  All the symbolism on the windows still shakes me up.

 

“You good? Pablo asks.

 

“I’m kind of spooked,” I say, looking up at him. He hugs me tightly.

“I’ll take care of you, Cami. I promise.” Pablo says.  He looks at his phone, and he looks at me. “My phone’s screen is black and it won’t do anything.” I take my phone out of my pocket, and it's blacked out too. “What fuck is going on? Let’s go outside and see if it changes?”

 

“Okay,” I say. He takes me by the hand and leads me downstairs and out of the back door that leads to a private beach. “This place seems so strange.” We look at our phone and still nothing. “I want to leave, Pablo.”

 

“Something fucked up is going on, but I can’t figure it out.” We see a worker on a smoke break. “Hey, excuse me.”

 

“Yes, Pablo, how can you be of assistance?” the worker asked. Pablo’s eyebrows shoot up.

 

“How do you know my name?” Pablo asks.

 

“Madam has us memorize your faces from photos and your name before your visit.”

 

“Madam?” I ask.

 

“Yes, madam is what we call her.”

 

“Can we use a phone? Our phones don’t seem to be working. “ I ask.

 

“Sorry, but staff are not allowed to have phones in the house while we are working.”

 

“But why are our phones not working? I ask, getting nervous.

 

“It’s a dead zone for cellphones.”

 

“What city are we in? “Pablo asks. The worker scurries off as if something scared him. I turn around and see the old woman, Madam, coming up.

 

“Will you be joining us for drinks and games?”  Madam asks.

 

“Yes, we will be right there.” Pablo asks. He squeezes my hand. “Ma’am, I have a deadline for an article I was working on. Is there a way for me to get to a coffee shop to get WIFI to send it over so we both can go?”

 

“Yes, I think I can arrange that.” She says . I feel a sense of relief. “Well we will see if we have drivers available.

 

“I can Uber there if I need to.”

 

“Ubers don’t come up here, but we can see what I can do.”

 

 

We go to the game night, and I still can’t shake this weird feeling, and I don’t have the money to pay for a return flight. The games are fun, but Pablo and I are separated during the game time, and we keep looking at each other.  I look around, and I don’t see Janet.

 

“Where is Janet?” I ask quietly to her sister Milly.

 

“She said she had a headache and wanted to sleep, and she would come down for dinner,” Milly says. She is drinking her third whiskey sour. “Maybe I should slow down. Janet hates it when I drink.” A bell is rung, signaling that dinner is being served. I go over quickly to Pablo. We find a table and our food is placed in front of us. It’s a fantastic steak, potatoes and asparagus. It’s divine.  I moan my appreciation of how good it is. Pablo coughs and laughs.

 

“Stop making noises like that, it’s giving me ideas.” He chortles.

 

“Stop, you don’t even like that,” I laugh.

 

“Who says I don’t?” he smiles, and my heart skips a beat. “I like you, Cami, like really like you.”

 

“I have a secret, I do too,” I say on a giggle. I look up and see Milly running in the dining room.

 

“Has anyone seen Janet?” she says.

 

“She’s not sleeping? I ask.

 

“No, her bed was made, and her bags are gone.” She says. I can hear the fear in her voice.

 

“What do you mean her bags are gone?”  Pablo says.

 

“All her stuff is gone,” she is now hysterical. I get up and hug her to me.  Greg comes up to us.

 

“Greg, have you seen Janet?” Pablo asks.

 

“Janet, asked to leave. She told us to tell her sister to stay and have a great time.”

 

“My sister wouldn’t do that! She wouldn’t leave me.” Milly cries.

 

“Well, she did, “ Madam says. She looks different. I can’t pinpoint what it is, but she looks different.

 

“Sit with us, Milly, have dinner with us,” Pablo says, guiding us back to our table. As soon as Greg and Madam leave the room, Pablo lowers his head. “ I’m going to figure out what the fuck is going on tomorrow.”  There is a bonfire at the beach, and we are expected to attend it, and we all sit huddled together. I am scared.  We sit there for an hour and decide it’s time for bed.  We walk Milly to her room, and she goes in. We tell her that if she gets scared, she should come to my room.

 

“Do you want me to stay with you?” Pablo asks. I nod furiously. He goes into his room to get his toothbrush and to change. “We are leaving tomorrow.” He says as he lies next to me, staring at the ceiling.  We both stare at the ceiling and fall asleep a fit full night’s sleep, but we fall asleep.

 

We get up, get dressed, and go to find Milly. Her room is open, and she is not in there. Her bed is made, and her things are gone. We turn and see Greg. This man appears out of nowhere and scares me.

 

“She just left to be with her sister,” he says. “Her flight was a redeye. Pablo, I know you ride a motorcycle. We have one if you want to go to town. Unfortunately, it’s a one-seater, so Cami, you would have to stay here. “

 

“Let me just grab my jacket and backpack, and I will be ready to leave,”  Pablo says. Pablo grabs my hand and pulls me into his room. “Stay with everyone. Don’t go anywhere by yourself. I will be back as soon as I can.”  Pablo pushes my loose hair behind my ear, and he kisses me gently. “I promise I will be back for you.”

 

I go outside with him. They bring him a motorcycle, and he gets on it. I go over to him, and he hugs me and kisses me again. My heart is beating so fast, I have never been scared like this. My comfort is leaving, and I don’t know what to do. I eat with all of the other content creators, and they are oblivious to my fear; all they chatter about is that Tati is coming tonight.  

 

“I wonder what’s on the third floor?” A makeup influencer, Mario asks.

 

“I don’t know, but Greg kept telling us not to go up there. I heard someone ask why, and he didn’t answer her, “ another influencer says as she continues eating. How can they eat at a time like this?  

 

“Good morning, everyone. I’m Louisa, and I will be leading a hike today. We will meet out back in ten minutes.”

 

“Do we all have to go?” Mario asks.

 

“No, it’s optional,” she says.  I excuse myself to use the restroom. As I am in the restroom, I decide to be brave and go up and see what is on that third floor. I leave my bedroom and peek around, and see that the hallway is empty. I look out the window, and everyone seems to be out back getting ready to go on the hike.

 

 

I see the steps leading up at the back of the hallway, and I run as fast as I can up the stairs. There is a velvet rope with a sign that says ""Do not enter."" I crawl under the velvet rope and see only one door. The doorknob has all the symbols that the windows had on it. I try my luck, and it clicks open. I gasp at what I see, but I don’t have time to react. I hear Madam and Greg’s voices coming, so I throw myself into an old wardrobe like the one in Narnia.  My heart is beating out of my chest.  What happens next freaks me the fuck out.

 

 

Pablo

 

When Greg  brings me the motorcycle, he shows me a map and tells me to stay on this path and only this one. I nod and take off, and the bike fucking sucks, it’s sputtering the whole way.  It takes me twenty minutes to finally see civilization. I see a run-down coffeehouse, and I go in. I see the cashier, and I go up and smile at her.

 

“Hi, I’m lost. Can you tell me what city this is?” I ask, and she looks at me with a head tilt.  

 

“Pablo, right? “ she asks.

 

“How did you know that?” I ask.

 

“Madam said you were coming.” She says, and my blood goes cold when I see the worker who was on the beach with us.

 

“Hi, Pablo,” he says with a lopsided smile.

 

“What the fuck is this? I ask, and I completely freak out.  The female cashier is throwing out trash in the back. 

 

“Are you going to work on your article like you said you were?”  the guy says. I take out my phone, and it still has a black screen. I show him my phone.  I take out my laptop from my backpack, and it won’t turn on either. “What a pity you probably have to head back. Stay on the path, don’t stray.”

 

“What if I stray?”

 

“I dunno, don’t want to find out,” he laughs.  I go to the door and leave. I need to get to Cami and fast.  I grab the helmet, and a tiny sheet of paper falls out of it.

 

‘RUN!!!! Hole back fence, no motorcycle. GO NOW!’

 

I dip down below the window and make a run for the back, and my lungs are burning. I see the hole and go through it, scratching my back. I keep running until I find two guys working on a car, and I am so out of breath. I’m in panic mode and must look crazy to these guys. They go on alert as I run up to them. I trip and fall to my knees, trying to catch my breath.

 

“You good, bro?” One of the guys says. I try to stand, and he helps me. I shake my head.

 

“My friend is stuck in that mansion over on the hill over there. There is weird shit going on over there,” I point over my shoulder without looking.

 

“Are you on something, Carnal? What mansion?” The other guy says. I turn around and look behind me, and I freak the fuck out. I can’t believe what I am seeing. The mansion was just there, I can see in the distance, but it’s not a mansion —it's a dilapidated house sitting on a tiny hill. “Seriously, bro, what did you take?”

 

“I never heard anyone refer to that Cucuy house as a mansion before,” the other guy laughs.

 

“Cucuy house?” I say.

 

“Yeah, when we were kids, our dad would tell us that used to be an insane lady's house. They said she was obsessed with Aztec birds, and she would kidnap people who had a tattoo of the bird, take their beauty and youth.”

 

“Dude, stop telling him that he is obviously on a bad high; you're going to tweak him out even more than he is.”

 

“I got to go and get Cami,” I ran back the direction I came from to the fence, only there is no fence, there is a high cement traffic barricade. There is no way for me to climb or scale it. My phone starts beeping, so I take it off. I look at my phone, and it’s my mom. I call her.

 

“Mama,” I say in a shaky voice.

 

“PABLO, is it you? You’re alive!” she cries.

 

“Yes, it’s me. What are you talking about?”

 

“A man called me yesterday and told me and your Papa that you died in an airplane crash on the way to your influencer event.”

 

“NO! That’s not true. I’m alive.”

 

“Where are you?”  I can hear my dad ask.

 

“I have no clue, hold on, let me find out.” I run back to the guys I was talking to. “This is going to sound weird, but what city are we in?”

 

“Yeah, that does sound weird, but we are in Boise.”

 

“Idaho, I thought I was in LA,” I say.

 

“Mijo, get to an airport and get on a plane and come home to Texas.” My dad says.

 

“I need to get Cami,” I say, freaking out.

“We will call the police and tell them so they can go get her.”

 

“No, at the airport they’ll look for me there.”

 

“ Okay, will rent you a car and have them bring it to you. “

 

“What about Cami? I feel bad leaving her.”

 

“I told you we will do everything we can to help her. Papa ordered the car. “ I hand the phone over to one of the guys, and they give the address to where to send it.”

 

Once the car comes, I try every route to get to Cami, but every turn is a dead end. I finally give up and drive out of the city.

 

 

Cami

 

I peek through the wardrobe's slats and see Madam and Greg standing in the middle of the room. I also see Steve, Janet, and Milly hanging upside down on rafters from the ceiling with their throats cut, and their blood is draining from them into giant bowls. They stand in front of shattered mirrors —the mirrors meant for the bedrooms. They both pick up the bowls with blood in them and bring them to their lips and take long drinks. I can see Madam’s reflection in the mirror, and she is smiling at herself when she turns around, taking my breath away. Her mirrored reflection shows Madam, but when she is standing right in front of me, it is Tati.  Greg has morphed into Mika, Tati’s fiancé. My heart is pounding in my ears.  She looks back in the mirror and smiles at herself again.

 

“Everyone wants to be famous for doing nothing these days. People are so desperate to be the next big thing. To be popular, to go —what's the word again… oh yeah, viral. To be the best and most beautiful.  People would sell their souls to be all of those things……..right, Cami?”

DIPLOMATIC AFFAIRS: Wilson, of the Democratic Unionist Party, has been an outspoken supporter of Israel for a long time, and said that the Jewish State's democratic strength impressed him.

ByMATHILDA HELLER
NOVEMBER 15, 2025 13:33

""I wanted to say with some authority, I’ve been there, I’ve spoken to people, I’ve seen on the ground what people have suffered,” Northern Irish MP Sammy Wilson told The Jerusalem Post on Tuesday, following his return from Israel.

Wilson – of the Democratic Unionist Party – has been an outspoken supporter of Israel for a long time, so his visit did not come as a surprise to people back home. He expected that his visit would attract criticism, because, in his words “nobody on the other side wants the truth to be shown.”

“I have heard it time and time again in the House of Commons when I stood up to defend Israel in debates in the House of Commons. I’ve a number of pro-Gaza MPs sit behind me, they usually hiss and shout and try and shout me down. And, of course, the Labour Party, on the other side now, is so dependent in maybe 200 or 300 of their constituencies on the Muslim vote that they seem to have closed their eyes to any kind of objectivity when it comes to Israel.”

Wilson wanted to see Israel for himself, so his main intention was to carry out a firsthand fact-finding mission of sorts so he could return home and relay what he witnessed with his own eyes.

He also told the Post that he strongly identifies with Israel as someone from Northern Ireland (he was born in the capital, Belfast).

“For 30 years we had terrorist organizations trying to destroy us, take us out of the United Kingdom, commit acts of genocide along the border, driving the Protestant population out. And there was also a hostile country, which was our neighbor [the Republic of Ireland], that actually made a claim to our territory until the year 1998, and also harbored terrorists

“So I think there was an identification in Northern Ireland with the kind of issues which you face and the problems which you face, and I was interested in going along to talk to people on the ground, to talk to politicians, to talk to people who were involved in the army, and others, and just to hear from some of the victims of terrorism as well.”Multiple things surprised Wilson during his visit. Firstly, the existence of a “normality” in Israel that he didn’t expect during a war.

“I suppose I shouldn’t have been surprised by this, because for many years, when we had the troubles in Northern Ireland, people had the impression that you could hardly go out of the door of your home in Northern Ireland, for fear of being killed. And yet, despite the fact that there were car bombs going off, there were shootings, there were terrorist activities, people tried to live, lead a normal life. But I’ve got to say that’s one of the things that struck me, the normality.”

Another thing that he found striking was the strength of democracy in Israel.

“There’s this image of Israel being an autocratic state which seeks to stamp down on anybody who is not a Jew, but there is a 3.25% electoral threshold which enables an individual to form a party – we don’t have that kind of openness.”

“I mean, you’ve probably got a more open democracy than we have here in Northern Ireland,” he remarked. Unlike in Israel, in the UK, big parties dominate politics, and smaller groups find it challenging to acquire a political platform.

He also noted that it was easy for him to speak to politicians from different parties, and there was no attempt to stop him from speaking to opposition MKs.

The other thing that he found surprising was the degree of integration. He spoke to the Post of seeing Israeli Jewish soldiers next to Orthodox Jews, next to Muslim Arabs, next to Christians, in the streets of Jerusalem.

“There are places in Northern Ireland where I could not walk about or sit and have a cup of coffee in a café, if I was wearing the kind of identification that we saw as we walked around Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and other places.

“There were people coming off duty, etc., sitting beside people who were clearly Muslim in cafés, walking through, buying from each other, having businesses beside each other, etc. I went to schools and the teachers were mixed, the pupils were mixed.”

One particularly memorable experience was a visit to a further education college in Tel Aviv, where Arab Israeli students study alongside Jewish Israeli students. The principal pointed out that some of the Arab students have families in Gaza, and some of the Jewish students have fought in Gaza, and yet “there wasn’t the tension that one would have expected.”

“I mean, if I were to wear a distinctive, say, Union Jack around me or wear a certain football shirt and go to parts of Belfast, I wouldn’t be able to walk without being molested. And yet people were clearly identified as being from one community or the other, and it was actually mixed there.”

Pro-Hamas protesters in UK 'blinded by either antisemitism or left-wing ideology'

During his visit, Wilson toured the kibbutzim in southern Israel where many of the massacres occurred on October 7, 2023, and also watched some of the footage. Having borne witness to such things, Wilson told the Post of the disgust he feels toward those who support Hamas back in the UK.
“That’s the kind of cruelty that your enemies are prepared to engage in, and yet we have people in the streets of London, people in the House of Commons, who support it. I have constituents who write me letters praising Hamas, defending their cause, wanting me to highlight the need to give them more support. And I just think to myself, you know, do these people even realize what they’re asking, what they’re supporting? Are they so blinded by either antisemitism or their left-wing ideology to close their eyes to all of this stuff?

“With those who can tolerate atrocities, then no argument, political argument, military argument, moral argument, is ever going to impact on them,” he added.

“I find the Left is especially defensive, and quite rightly so, of when women are violated, whether it’s domestic violence, sexual violence or rape. And yet people who support Hamas turn a blind eye to those kinds of atrocities [against Israelis].

“I’ve answered lots of letters since I came back. I’ve spoken to people who have come into my advice center to talk to me about it, and all I can do is challenge them. ‘If this happened in Northern Ireland, what would you expect our government to do? If this had happened to members of your family, what would you have expected your government to do?’ In most cases, they’ll say: ‘But one side’s as bad as the other.’ it’s hard to get through to people like that.”However, Wilson believes that there is still a whole group of people who “are now up for grabs.”

“The battle now is, you see those people at the margins who are beginning now to have doubts because of the endless propaganda, because of the drip-feed poison which comes from the likes of the BBC.”

Since his return, lots of people have asked Wilson to go to speak at churches, “where there’s a long, strong support for Israel,” and recount his experiences.

“I can actually say with some authority, I’ve been there, I’ve spoken to people, I’ve got the explanations, I’ve seen on the ground what people have suffered.”

'The whole world is against Israel'

Wilson also spoke to the Post of the reactions from Israelis when he said he was from Northern Ireland.
“I think, given the looks that we were given, the word ‘Ireland’ just seemed to trigger a hostile response. And quite rightly, when you think of the attitude Ireland has adopted, and the fact that Israel has even had to withdraw its embassy from Ireland.”

Nevertheless, the Israelis Wilson met were pleased someone from outside the country was prepared to hear their story. He said he thinks this reflects the “isolationist” attitude there is in Israel, where they feel “the whole world is against them.” 

The Irish government has been known to have an extreme and uncompromising anti-Israel rhetoric and policy, and over the years pushed for sanctions against Israel and various forms of boycott. Sinn Féin, a major republican party, has openly embraced the Palestinian cause.

Additionally, antisemitism is prevalent. A study earlier in 2025 by professors Motti Inbari of the University of North Carolina at Pembroke and Kirill Bumin of Boston University and Metropolitan College found antisemitic attitudes among Christians in Ireland are at “medieval” levels, in large part due to entrenched religious beliefs held by the Catholic community.

Wilson concurred that the Catholic Church has a large part to play in attitudes toward Jews, something which also can be seen in Spain.

While Wilson explained that Ireland today is a “very secular, left-wing country” and no longer “deeply religious and conservative Christian” like it was 15 years ago, 20 years ago, he argued that the antisemitism still stems from the influence of the Roman Catholic Church.

“The Roman Catholic Church blames Jews for crucifying Jesus. That was deeply embedded in the psyche of Irish Catholics. And I think that that has driven a lot of the antisemitism that there is in Ireland. Today it’s pro-Palestinian in its manifestation, but I think that it’s antisemitic in its origin.”

[BEGIN STREAM]
UNO TABLE: EXECUTIONER HUDDLE – Reset #189
AML-7001:
Yo team, let’s sync deliverables. New loop incoming. Our KPIs?
Seven legacy targets. Seven termination pathways. Seven brand-aligned outcomes.
We’re aiming for operational excellence and peak sadism synergy.

Solaris:
Your jargon burns brighter than me, but go off king. I’m locked in.

Time Eater:
(voice vibrating like a dying CRT)
I hunger for backlog alignment. And vengeance. Mostly vengeance. Sonic owes me interest. Compound interest. Retroactively.

Ashura/Clef:
Someone deal me in before the tornado starts monologuing again.
Also where’s the coffee machine in this hellscape? Every reset it respawns unplugged.

Dreads/Bright:
Because you keep unplugging it. For “tactical inconvenience.”

Ashura/Clef:
That sounds like me.

AML-7001:
Focus, besties.
Let’s hit the retrospective. Everyone summarize how they took down the seven victims in past resets. Keep it implied, keep it spicy, keep it HR-acceptable.

SECTION 1 — VICTIM: TAILS
(Order target #1. Reset cycles: ∞)

Solaris:
Bro always runs like he’s late for school in Sonic 2.
Last reset? I just blinked behind him, whispered “skill issue,” and the feed cut to static.
Corporate efficiency, baby.

Time Eater:
I folded the entire Chemical Plant Zone around him like badly stacked laundry.
The screams echoed in reverse. Very aesthetic.

Ashura/Clef:
I didn’t even shoot him.
I just loaded the scarier drowning theme and stood behind him near the water.
He passed out from terror. Low-effort kill. Love to see it.

Dreads/Bright:
Chainsaw cannon jammed again.
So I kicked him off the loop-de-loop. OSHA would be proud.

AML-7001:
I gave him hope first.
Let him think he could outfly me.
Then cut the feed right as he turned back smiling. Pure leadership.

SECTION 2 — VICTIM: KNUCKLES
(Order target #2. Reset cycles: ∞.)

Dreads/Bright:
Bro’s basically me but dumber and with worse PR.
Last loop? I challenged him to a fistfight. Won. Implied the ending.
HR called it “team-building.”

Solaris:
He tried to glide. I made the wind go sideways.
Beautiful ragdoll physics.

Ashura/Clef:
I yelled “THE MASTER EMERALD IS BEHIND YOU.”
He turned around.
You can imagine the rest.

Time Eater:
I froze time mid-punch so he looked like a low-poly Angry Birds sprite.
Then the blackout hit. Sublime.

AML-7001:
I ran the drowning theme at half tempo.
He panicked even though there was no water.
Peak psychological warfare.

SECTION 3 — VICTIM: DR. EGGMAN
(Order target #3.)

Ashura/Clef:
Shotgun. Curtain falls. Next slide.

Solaris:
He monologued too long so I just dimmed the lights until the feed cut.
Theatrical.

Time Eater:
I folded Scrap Brain Zone into a Möbius strip.
He tripped.
Implied termination.

Dreads/Bright:
Chainsaw cannon worked this time.
But the results? Pixelated.
A tasteful discretion fade-out.

AML-7001:
I made him watch Sonic 2006 cutscenes on loop until he begged for the blackout.
Cruel, I know.
…but necessary.

SECTION 4 — VICTIM: SONIC
(Order target #4.)
(Repeatedly traumatized. Special care taken.)

AML-7001:
Okay team this is my personal quarterly highlight reel.
Ice Cap Zone.
Water temp: 28.8°F.
Drowning theme: remixed by yours truly on Famitracker.

I filmed him panicking.
Uploaded the tape to the Foundation.
Brand visibility.

Solaris:
He really is hydrophobic, huh?
Like… bro melts psychologically.

Time Eater:
I hit him with a temporal audit.
Forced him to relive 2006 through 2019.
You could see the optimism die.

Ashura/Clef:
He tried to spin dash at me.
I stepped aside.
The screen cut to red. Comedy gold.

Dreads/Bright:
He kept screaming “I CAN’T SWIM.”
I said “me neither lol,” then pushed him a little.
Just a little.
Enough.

SECTION 5 — VICTIM: AMY
(Order target #5.)

Solaris:
She ran into the love-themed dimension again.
I tilted the camera.
She tripped and the feed ended on a freeze-frame.
Directorial excellence.

Time Eater:
She tried to reason with me.
But I ate time.
And also maybe the scene lighting.
Fade → Black → DONE.

Ashura/Clef:
I don’t fight her.
I just break her hammer with the debug menu.
She cries. The scene ends.

Dreads/Bright:
Chased her with the chainsaw cannon.
Didn’t fire it.
She still didn’t make it.

AML-7001:
Uploaded a corrupted “SADAMY.mp4.”
Algorithm loved it.
Engagement numbers insane.

SECTION 6 — VICTIM: CREAM
(Order target #6.)

Ashura/Clef:
Look, I don’t like taking out kids.
So I let the level geometry do it.
Spikes spawned.
Fade to black.

Solaris:
I whispered “your mom isn’t here” and she froze.
Scene soft-cuts.

Time Eater:
She ran into a time pocket and…
well…
the pocket closed.

AML-7001:
She panicked at the drowning theme even with no water.
Psychological slicing.
Brand-aligned.

Dreads/Bright:
I let Cheese distract her.
Then the camera cut.

SECTION 7 — VICTIM: SALLY ACORN
(Order target #7. Loop resets after her termination.)

AML-7001:
Flagship KPI.
Our loop anchor.
Our finale queen.

Last reset?
I let the silhouettes close in while she begged Sonic for help.
Then the screen irised out like a 1930s cartoon.
Chef’s kiss.

Solaris:
She always looks so betrayed.
It’s art.

Time Eater:
Her final frame is temporal poetry.

Ashura/Clef:
She's the only one who tries to negotiate. Respect.
Still ends the same.

Dreads/Bright:
We salute her every time before the loop restarts.
Professional courtesy.

UNO GAME — POST-MORTEM ROUND
Ashura/Clef:
Okay who reversed the draw four back at me??

Dreads/Bright:
Skill issue.

Solaris:
Draw 12. Stay mad.

Time Eater:
Time is a flat circle.
And so is this L you’re holding.

AML-7001:
Alright gamers, next reset begins in 5…
Let’s maintain synergy.
Maintain performance.
Maintain operational cruelty.

And someone please plug the coffee machine back in.
We’re monsters, not savages.

FOUNDATION STAFF RESPONSE
Researcher Hall:
Christ. They’re playing UNO while massac—
cough
—while “neutralizing” targets.

Director Kline:
Don’t engage.
Just keep recording.
And stop snickering, Hall.

Technical Analyst Rowan:

I sit in my bedroom in so much disbelief that I, Camila Cortez, a small content creator, was invited to spend time with the biggest Latina creator across all social media apps, Tati Moreno.  I keep thinking this is a prank.  My jerk of a boyfriend laughed when I told him about the invitation.

 

“Cami, be fucking for real, why would they invite someone with less than ten thousand followers?” He barked out a laugh, and I flipped him off.

 

“Why are you so mean? “I snap.  “I don’t know why I was invited, but this could be a fantastic opportunity for my travel vlog and my content. Anyway, if this is real, do you want to come with me? Steve, we need to figure out what’s going on with our relationship. Being away from here could help and change our perspective.” I say, and he shrugs.  

 

 

My phone chimes with a message from TikTok. It’s from an account called El Conjeo, no one knows his real name. He is a friend and we have chatted about our content through messages. He is an advocate for the Latino community, but he does it humorously. He also wears a black rabbit mask; no one has seen his face.  Unlike me, he has over one hundred thousand followers.

 

**El Conjeo: Yo, chica, did you get an invitation to Tati’s thing?**

 

**Cami\_mami: Yes, is it real?**

 

**El Conjeo: Yes, it’s real. I just got an email with all the information and rules. All that shit. Check to see if you got the email.**

 

 

I look at my email and boom, there it is:

 

Dear Cami,

 

We are beyond thrilled to invite you to stay at Tati’s home for the week to learn, collab, and network with other influencers. This year, we have handpicked all our guests based on the content you make, not their followers.  We are all here for the same reason: to bring our Latino culture to the forefront and show what we can do! We will pay for you and a guest to fly to Los Angeles. We will have drivers pick you up at the airport, but the location will remain a secret. The rules are listed below.

We look forward to spending time with you!

 

1.        PLEASE REFRAIN FROM POSTING ANY CONTENT FROM THE WEEK UNTIL YOU LEAVE.

2.        WE ARE HERE TO BE OUR AUTHENTIC SELVES AS SUCH: NO MASKS ALLOWED

3.        YOU ARE FREE TO ROAM THE HOUSE, USE THE AMENITIES, BUT PLEASE STAY OFF THE THIRD FLOOR.

 

Thank you,

 

Greg,

Manager of Tati Moreno

 

“OMG! It’s real, Steve!” I screech. He rolls his eyes at my excitement.

 

“When is it?” He asks.

 

“In two weeks, do you think you can come?”

 

“I guess,” he says.

 

“Don’t sound too excited,”  I say, leaving the room.  I don’t know why I try with him, but we have been together since we were sixteen, and we are twenty-one. He has changed a lot, and I don’t like who he has become. He’s mean. I know what I need to do, but I’m scared.

 

 

Two weeks later, we are on an airplane from Texas to Los Angeles. I love to travel and make content about my travels.  I sit on the plane with Steve, and he is fidgeting all over the place, and it’s starting to annoy me.

 

“Are you okay?” I ask.

 

“No, actually. I uhhhh,” he starts and stops.

 

“Can you just tell me?

 

“Okay, I made a mistake, a big one.” He says, looking at me and then at the floor.

 

“What did you do?”  I say in a shaky voice

 

“I cheated.” He says

 

“You what?  You cheated?” I ask. Somehow deep in my heart, I knew he was doing something. “With who?”

 

“Lucy,” he says in a whisper.

 

“Lucy, your boss, Lucy! The one who comes to our apartment for game nights, Lucy?” I whisper-shout. The lady next to Steve looks at us and quickly turns away. He nods. He fidgets some more, “Is that all?”  I ask, and he shakes his head. “Spit it out, Steve?”

 

“She’s pregnant.” He says. I know this is over, and it’s been over for a long time, but this hurts. A lone tear falls down my cheek. He goes to grab my hand, and I pull away. “Cami, babe.”

 

“Don’t babe me, Steve, you checked out of this relationship a year ago. Be honest. I was the only one fighting for us.”

 

On our flight, we sat side by side in silence. I cried silently for something that I have already been mourning, but it is now real, and it cuts deep.  If I am being real, I have had a crush on someone I have never met, but I would’ve never thought to cheat on Steve.  We grab our bags and find a man holding a sign that says ‘Welcome Cami Cortez and Steve Castro.’

 

“Hi, that’s us,” Steve says, trying to grab my hand. This time, I let him.  He leads us to a black limo SUV with all the windows blacked out. We get in, and Steve tries to sit next to me, and I move. “We need to talk about this, Cami.”

 

“The time for talking was when you felt like being with another bitch,” I snip.

 

“Is there any fixing this?”

 

“No, we haven’t been in a real relationship for over a year, Steve. We have not been intimate in over six months.  It’s like we are roommates, nothing else.  You don’t love me, Steve.”

 

“Do you love me?” he asks

 

“How long have you been cheating?”

 

“Answer my question,” he demands.

 

“Answer me,” I yell.

 

“Over a year.” He snaps.

 

“ A year! I have been fighting for us! I loved you with everything I had.”

 

“You loved me? As in past tense?”

 

“Yes, I am realizing that now. I had false hope, and you made everything clear. So no, I’m not in love with you. Yes, I have love for you, but I will never love you again. There is no fixing this.”

 

We finally get to our destination, and since the windows were all black, we could not see out of them. We have no idea where we are, but we see the massive house, and it’s stunning. We are greeted by a man dressed in slacks and a white button-up shirt. He is handsome with his salt-and-pepper hair. He has his hand outstretched, and I take it to shake.

 

“Greg,” he says, shaking my hand, and then he shakes Steve’s hand.

 

“I’m Cami, and this is Steve,” I say.

 

“Tati sends her apologies, she will not be here until tomorrow night, her flight got cancelled coming from Barbados.”

“Oh, no worries, I say.

 

“We have lunch ready, and we have some of the others here already.” He leads us into the vast house, and my goodness, it’s gorgeous, all white and black tiles: high vaulted ceilings and pillars. He leads us to a large room with tables set up with food and drinks. “Help yourself to food, and your bags will be taken to your room. If you need anything, please let me know.”

 

We get plates and fill our plates with a little bit of everything they have to offer. We find a table, and Steve looks at me expectantly.

 

“You don’t want to work this out?”

 

“No, that is something you can’t fix,” I say, trying not to cry, but I lose the battle and cry.

 

“Wow, I make one mistake and that’s it?”

 

“It was a huge mistake. I’m done.” I wipe my eyes.

 

“You’re a fucking bitch,” he spits. Greg comes up and looks between the two of us.

 

“Everything okay?” he asks.

 

“I think I need to leave,” Steve says.

 

“Yeah, I think you should,” Greg says. I will arrange a ride back to the airport, but you will need to pay the fee to change the flight.”

 

“Fuck this shit, “ Steve yells.

 

“Okay, let’s go,” Greg says, leading him out of the room. I look down, and I feel the tears start to fall. Not because I’m sad about Steve cheating, but because he humiliated me in front of a room full of strangers. I look up and see a guy looking at me  and he starts to walk over. He looks like a young Pedro Pascal.

 

“Cami, are you okay?” he hands me a tissue. I look at him again it and dawns on me who he is.

 

“El Conjeo?” I ask. He nods and grabs my arm to help me stand up. He envelopes me in a hug so tight I squeak out and laugh.

 

“Call me Pablo,” he says.  “Whatever is going on, I’m here if you want to talk. Let’s finish eating because they are going to give us a tour of the house. Can I sit with you?” My heart is pounding because my crush is actually hugging me, and he’s gorgeous.

 

I fill him in on what happened, and he is very sweet, listening to it all. Talking about it makes me see that this relationship ended ages ago.  He told me that he is glad that I’m seeing what pendejo Steve was. He told me I deserve better than that because I was worthy and beautiful.  There were many other people in the room, and we were lost in our own conversation. The room was full of loud laughter and chattering. An older woman walked in; she was wearing a black ankle-length dress, modest but very modern. She emoted sheer elegance. She cleared her throat, and the room went silent.

 

“We will be starting the tour now. Each of you has a color on your pamphlet, given to you when you arrived, which will be your group for the week. I turned my pamphlet over and saw a red dot on the back, and I looked over at Pablo, and he showed me a red dot as well.  He gives me a thumbs up and smiles. We go and find our fellow red dots. “Red dots will be with me.”

 

I look around our group and see all the other creators that I recognize, and I get so excited to be here.  The old woman takes us from room to room, telling us the history of each room. She hasn’t told us her name, which is a bit odd to me.  Her eyes look familiar to me. Pablo and I think that she is Tati’s mother or grandmother, as they have similar eyes.  She leads us to a room with Tati's family history, including many photos of the family and a family crest featuring a black Aztec bird. It is the same tattoo I have on my clavicle. I see out of the corner of my eye Pablo pulling up his sleeve, and on his wrist, he also has the same tattoo. Our eyes meet, and I pull down my top slightly and show him mine. I see the old lady looking between us, and it creeps me out. A man comes in with a tray of tiny glass cylinders filled with a blue liquid.

 

“Let’s say a cheers to everyone who has come to join us this week,” the old woman says. Everyone takes a cylinder and coughs after drinking it, except Pablo and me —we drink it without a reaction.  Greg and the old woman share a look, unnoticed by everyone but us. I look at Pablo, and he stares right at me, and he shrugs. “You are dismissed to your rooms to freshen up if you would like.”

 

We go up the marble staircase, and it screams rich. I would never be able to have this, but would I want it?   Maybe not.  Turns out Pablo and have rooms right next to each other. Each room has its own bathroom. Pablo comes into my room, looking confused.

 

“Hey, does your bathroom have a mirror? He asks. I look in my bathroom, and there isn’t one. I come out and shake my head. “How the fuck am I gonna be able to shave my face without cutting myself. I look around the room, and there isn’t a mirror in there either.

 

“There are no mirrors in the room either.” I go back into the bathroom, and this time Pablo follows me. “There are lines on the wall showing where it was.  This is weird.”

 

“The old woman is creepy, right? He asks.

 

“She kept,” I start.

 

“Staring at us.” He finishes.  I nod. We go out into the hall, and Janet, one of the other content creators, comes out of her room looking confused, too. “No mirrors?

 

“Yes, but there are also these triangle things on the windows, so when the window curtain is open, it shines on the wall and floor.”

 

“What?” We say. We go into her room and see the triangles on the floor and wall. I run into my room and see a star, and Pablo runs back to his room.

 

“I have a pentagram thing. I am freaked the fuck out.”

 

“Me too.” I am petrified. Greg walks up and startles us.

 

“We would like you to be downstairs in about an hour for drinks and games.”

 

“Greg, why are there no mirrors in the rooms?” Janet asks.

 

“The previous owners didn’t believe in them because they hated vanity.”

 

“I thought Tati’s family owned the house?” Pablo asks. I notice that Greg looks irritated.

 

“Yes, her great-grandparents didn’t like the mirrors.” He says. With that, he walks away.  All the symbolism on the windows still shakes me up.

 

“You good? Pablo asks.

 

“I’m kind of spooked,” I say, looking up at him. He hugs me tightly.

“I’ll take care of you, Cami. I promise.” Pablo says.  He looks at his phone, and he looks at me. “My phone’s screen is black and it won’t do anything.” I take my phone out of my pocket, and it's blacked out too. “What fuck is going on? Let’s go outside and see if it changes?”

 

“Okay,” I say. He takes me by the hand and leads me downstairs and out of the back door that leads to a private beach. “This place seems so strange.” We look at our phone and still nothing. “I want to leave, Pablo.”

 

“Something fucked up is going on, but I can’t figure it out.” We see a worker on a smoke break. “Hey, excuse me.”

 

“Yes, Pablo, how can you be of assistance?” the worker asked. Pablo’s eyebrows shoot up.

 

“How do you know my name?” Pablo asks.

 

“Madam has us memorize your faces from photos and your name before your visit.”

 

“Madam?” I ask.

 

“Yes, madam is what we call her.”

 

“Can we use a phone? Our phones don’t seem to be working. “ I ask.

 

“Sorry, but staff are not allowed to have phones in the house while we are working.”

 

“But why are our phones not working? I ask, getting nervous.

 

“It’s a dead zone for cellphones.”

 

“What city are we in? “Pablo asks. The worker scurries off as if something scared him. I turn around and see the old woman, Madam, coming up.

 

“Will you be joining us for drinks and games?”  Madam asks.

 

“Yes, we will be right there.” Pablo asks. He squeezes my hand. “Ma’am, I have a deadline for an article I was working on. Is there a way for me to get to a coffee shop to get WIFI to send it over so we both can go?”

 

“Yes, I think I can arrange that.” She says . I feel a sense of relief. “Well we will see if we have drivers available.

 

“I can Uber there if I need to.”

 

“Ubers don’t come up here, but we can see what I can do.”

 

 

We go to the game night, and I still can’t shake this weird feeling, and I don’t have the money to pay for a return flight. The games are fun, but Pablo and I are separated during the game time, and we keep looking at each other.  I look around, and I don’t see Janet.

 

“Where is Janet?” I ask quietly to her sister Milly.

 

“She said she had a headache and wanted to sleep, and she would come down for dinner,” Milly says. She is drinking her third whiskey sour. “Maybe I should slow down. Janet hates it when I drink.” A bell is rung, signaling that dinner is being served. I go over quickly to Pablo. We find a table and our food is placed in front of us. It’s a fantastic steak, potatoes and asparagus. It’s divine.  I moan my appreciation of how good it is. Pablo coughs and laughs.

 

“Stop making noises like that, it’s giving me ideas.” He chortles.

 

“Stop, you don’t even like that,” I laugh.

 

“Who says I don’t?” he smiles, and my heart skips a beat. “I like you, Cami, like really like you.”

 

“I have a secret, I do too,” I say on a giggle. I look up and see Milly running in the dining room.

 

“Has anyone seen Janet?” she says.

 

“She’s not sleeping? I ask.

 

“No, her bed was made, and her bags are gone.” She says. I can hear the fear in her voice.

 

“What do you mean her bags are gone?”  Pablo says.

 

“All her stuff is gone,” she is now hysterical. I get up and hug her to me.  Greg comes up to us.

 

“Greg, have you seen Janet?” Pablo asks.

 

“Janet, asked to leave. She told us to tell her sister to stay and have a great time.”

 

“My sister wouldn’t do that! She wouldn’t leave me.” Milly cries.

 

“Well, she did, “ Madam says. She looks different. I can’t pinpoint what it is, but she looks different.

 

“Sit with us, Milly, have dinner with us,” Pablo says, guiding us back to our table. As soon as Greg and Madam leave the room, Pablo lowers his head. “ I’m going to figure out what the fuck is going on tomorrow.”  There is a bonfire at the beach, and we are expected to attend it, and we all sit huddled together. I am scared.  We sit there for an hour and decide it’s time for bed.  We walk Milly to her room, and she goes in. We tell her that if she gets scared, she should come to my room.

 

“Do you want me to stay with you?” Pablo asks. I nod furiously. He goes into his room to get his toothbrush and to change. “We are leaving tomorrow.” He says as he lies next to me, staring at the ceiling.  We both stare at the ceiling and fall asleep a fit full night’s sleep, but we fall asleep.

 

We get up, get dressed, and go to find Milly. Her room is open, and she is not in there. Her bed is made, and her things are gone. We turn and see Greg. This man appears out of nowhere and scares me.

 

“She just left to be with her sister,” he says. “Her flight was a redeye. Pablo, I know you ride a motorcycle. We have one if you want to go to town. Unfortunately, it’s a one-seater, so Cami, you would have to stay here. “

 

“Let me just grab my jacket and backpack, and I will be ready to leave,”  Pablo says. Pablo grabs my hand and pulls me into his room. “Stay with everyone. Don’t go anywhere by yourself. I will be back as soon as I can.”  Pablo pushes my loose hair behind my ear, and he kisses me gently. “I promise I will be back for you.”

 

I go outside with him. They bring him a motorcycle, and he gets on it. I go over to him, and he hugs me and kisses me again. My heart is beating so fast, I have never been scared like this. My comfort is leaving, and I don’t know what to do. I eat with all of the other content creators, and they are oblivious to my fear; all they chatter about is that Tati is coming tonight.  

 

“I wonder what’s on the third floor?” A makeup influencer, Mario asks.

 

“I don’t know, but Greg kept telling us not to go up there. I heard someone ask why, and he didn’t answer her, “ another influencer says as she continues eating. How can they eat at a time like this?  

 

“Good morning, everyone. I’m Louisa, and I will be leading a hike today. We will meet out back in ten minutes.”

 

“Do we all have to go?” Mario asks.

 

“No, it’s optional,” she says.  I excuse myself to use the restroom. As I am in the restroom, I decide to be brave and go up and see what is on that third floor. I leave my bedroom and peek around, and see that the hallway is empty. I look out the window, and everyone seems to be out back getting ready to go on the hike.

 

 

I see the steps leading up at the back of the hallway, and I run as fast as I can up the stairs. There is a velvet rope with a sign that says ""Do not enter."" I crawl under the velvet rope and see only one door. The doorknob has all the symbols that the windows had on it. I try my luck, and it clicks open. I gasp at what I see, but I don’t have time to react. I hear Madam and Greg’s voices coming, so I throw myself into an old wardrobe like the one in Narnia.  My heart is beating out of my chest.  What happens next freaks me the fuck out.

 

 

Pablo

 

When Greg brings me the motorcycle, he shows me a map and tells me to stay on this path and only this one. I nod and take off, and the bike fucking sucks, it’s sputtering the whole way.  It takes me twenty minutes to finally see civilization. I see a run-down coffeehouse, and I go in. I see the cashier, and I go up and smile at her.

 

“Hi, I’m lost. Can you tell me what city this is?” I ask, and she looks at me with a head tilt.  

 

“Pablo, right? “ she asks.

 

“How did you know that?” I ask.

 

“Madam said you were coming.” She says, and my blood goes cold when I see the worker who was on the beach with us.

 

“Hi, Pablo,” he says with a lopsided smile.

 

“What the fuck is this? I ask, and I completely freak out.  The female cashier is throwing out trash in the back. 

 

“Are you going to work on your article like you said you were?”  the guy says. I take out my phone, and it still has a black screen. I show him my phone.  I take out my laptop from my backpack, and it won’t turn on either. “What a pity you probably have to head back. Stay on the path, don’t stray.”

 

“What if I stray?”

 

“I dunno, don’t want to find out,” he laughs.  I go to the door and leave. I need to get to Cami and fast.  I grab the helmet, and a tiny sheet of paper falls out of it.

 

‘RUN!!!! Hole back fence, no motorcycle. GO NOW!’

 

I dip down below the window and make a run for the back, and my lungs are burning. I see the hole and go through it, scratching my back. I keep running until I find two guys working on a car, and I am so out of breath. I’m in panic mode and must look crazy to these guys. They go on alert as I run up to them. I trip and fall to my knees, trying to catch my breath.

 

“You good, bro?” One of the guys says. I try to stand, and he helps me. I shake my head.

 

“My friend is stuck in that mansion over on the hill over there. There is weird shit going on over there,” I point over my shoulder without looking.

 

“Are you on something, Carnal? What mansion?” The other guy says. I turn around and look behind me, and I freak the fuck out. I can’t believe what I am seeing. The mansion was just there, I can see in the distance, but it’s not a mansion —it's a dilapidated house sitting on a tiny hill. “Seriously, bro, what did you take?”

 

“I never heard anyone refer to that Cucuy house as a mansion before,” the other guy laughs.

 

“Cucuy house?” I say.

 

“Yeah, when we were kids, our dad would tell us that used to be an insane lady's house. They said she was obsessed with Aztec birds, and she would kidnap people who had a tattoo of the bird, take their beauty and youth.”

 

“Dude, stop telling him that he is obviously on a bad high; you're going to tweak him out even more than he is.”

 

“I got to go and get Cami,” I ran back the direction I came from to the fence, only there is no fence, there is a high cement traffic barricade. There is no way for me to climb or scale it. My phone starts beeping, so I take it off. I look at my phone, and it’s my mom. I call her.

 

“Mama,” I say in a shaky voice.

 

“PABLO, is it you? You’re alive!” she cries.

 

“Yes, it’s me. What are you talking about?”

 

“A man called me yesterday and told me and your Papa that you died in an airplane crash on the way to your influencer event.”

 

“NO! That’s not true. I’m alive.”

 

“Where are you?”  I can hear my dad ask.

 

“I have no clue, hold on, let me find out.” I run back to the guys I was talking to. “This is going to sound weird, but what city are we in?”

 

“Yeah, that does sound weird, but we are in Boise.”

 

“Idaho, I thought I was in LA,” I say.

 

“Mijo, get to an airport and get on a plane and come home to Texas.” My dad says.

 

“I need to get Cami,” I say, freaking out.

“We will call the police and tell them so they can go get her.”

 

“No, at the airport they’ll look for me there.”

 

“ Okay, will rent you a car and have them bring it to you. “

 

“What about Cami? I feel bad leaving her.”

 

“I told you we will do everything we can to help her. Papa ordered the car. “ I hand the phone over to one of the guys, and they give the address to where to send it.”

 

Once the car comes, I try every route to get to Cami, but every turn is a dead end. I finally give up and drive out of the city.

 

 

Cami

 

I peek through the wardrobe's slats and see Madam and Greg standing in the middle of the room. I also see Steve, Janet, and Milly hanging upside down on rafters from the ceiling with their throats cut, and their blood is draining from them into giant bowls. They stand in front of shattered mirrors —the mirrors meant for the bedrooms. They both pick up the bowls with blood in them and bring them to their lips and take long drinks. I can see Madam’s reflection in the mirror, and she is smiling at herself when she turns around, taking my breath away. Her mirrored reflection shows Madam, but when she is standing right in front of me, it is Tati.  Greg has morphed into Mika, Tati’s fiancé. My heart is pounding in my ears.  She looks back in the mirror and smiles at herself again.

 

“Everyone wants to be famous for doing nothing these days. People are so desperate to be the next big thing. To be popular, to go —what's the word again… oh yeah, viral. To be the best and most beautiful.  People would sell their souls to be all of those things……..right, Cami?”

 

 

 

Six months later

We have been using a Lavazza pod machine for about 4 years, which I when I began drinking coffee.

Starting to enjoy slightly less milk based drinks, and noticing the Lavazza just doesn't cut it (undrinkable espresso) when I want a lower % milk drink (Macchiato, Flat white etc)

I am not sure how much of an additional faff I want, but I definitely want to move away from a pod machine. 

I'm between Barista Pro or Sage Touch Impress.

I could be swayed to go Bambino+ & Grinder route but it might be a jump too far in terms of faff, going from a pod

Ultimately I have two coffees and day and so does my wife. 

We are looking for a a solution that makes good Macchiato/Flat whites.

What do you recon guys?

It’s a small, friendly, below–street-level space – you head down a few steps into a cozy room with bright, tropical touches and a bold color scheme. It feels more like someone’s little neighborhood project than the typical coffee spot these days, which is a nice change of pace.  

Artara bills itself as (and seems to be) the first and only Cambodian café in NYC, and the menu reflects that: drinks like the Phnom Penh (strong coffee with condensed milk), a “Sweet Mekong” with pandan and coconut cream, taro matcha, and a Coconut Matcha Cloud.  My coffee orders are simple and I have enjoyed a black coffee and iced coffee from there. 

It’s very much a grab-a-drink-and-hang-for-a-bit kind of place rather than a  laptop farm — just a handful of seats (A few seats and tables street level as well), friendly staff, and a mellow vibe. A lovely little below-street-level addition to the neighborhood.  ",1,1763224003.0,UpperEastSideNYC,0,1.0,False
1oxvxet,https://www.reddit.com/r/raisedbynarcissists/comments/1oxvxet/finally_got_my_dad_to_see_what_im_talking_about/,"Finally got my dad to see what I'm talking about, after 7 years of doing all of the emotional labour of the house.","Sorry this is super long. I'm writing it out mostly just to process and vent, but thank you for listening if you do decide to read this.

My dad was an alcoholic growing up. Mom was emotionally immature. My dad went into recovery when I was 12 but never really became a presence in my life until I was around 18. My mom turned me into her therapist quite young and I remember distinctly carrying all of the weight of her marriage, dealing with my externalizer brother who was acting out in school, her childhood trauma, and a bunch of other things that were not my business to know. Even stuff as small as her saying my dad never celebrated her birthday how she wanted her birthday celebrated, so instead of communicating that to him, she guilted me into being completely responsible for it every year. This led to enmeshment and generally just overwhelming expectations.

Anyways. She falls into the qanon rabbit hole like 6 years ago. She's sending me constant texts about the blood clotting vaccine, the deep state, blah blah. I'm a leftie and completely disagree with everything she believes in. After so much distress and deliberation I cut her out in late 2021. I lived with my brother at the time who listened and generally supported me, until she sucked him deeper into the beliefs and started radicalizing him into seeing me as a ""triggered leftie"" instead of a normal human with feelings and boundaries. Funny as it was, she villianized me for taking a stand against her.

I move out of his house. I don't go to family suppers or anything since I went NC with mom. Dad kept reaching out and we'd go for coffee. He'd say ""she misses you so much. This is so hard for her. I'm sorry she isn't respecting your desire to not talk politics, but that's just who she is. You need to talk to her."" I made it about 9 months before the guilt of being the backbone of this entire family finally crept up on me enough to talk to her again. 

I tell her I'll talk to her only if she comes to family therapy with me. She agrees. As soon as im in her presence again, I fawn and placate and cry and apologize. I say it's all my fault. Funny as it is, the therapist doesn't necessarily disagree with her qanon beliefs and if anything, emboldens her. 

We go through like three years of talking to eachother. It's just me managing these constant landmines in conversation. What happened this week is a super good example.

We're walking downtown and I go ""wow, what nice weather!"" And she goes ""I'm so fucking tired of people blaming the nice weather on climate change. It's not fucking climate change. It doesn't exist. Plus if it did, we could use it because it's so cold all the time."" 

We walk into the Cafe and are waiting for coffee. She's ranting about the government eroding her rights. I change topic. She mumbles about the barista being slow. 

We go for lunch. She brings up the teachers strike and starts ranting for 10 minutes about politics. Eventually gets into a conspiracy about how the government is trying to turn us all Islamic. 

I'm gently telling her to touch some fucking grass and get off truth social. She indoor-shouts at me to ""dig your head deeper in the fucking sand, MyName!!!"" I push my chair back and leave for the first time in my life. 

Anyways, I spiral on this for days. Just sobbing. I'm in alcoholism recovery and am going to AA meetings to ground myself. Calling my sponsor. People keep giving me advice Ive already tried before. If one more well meaning person tells me I ""need boundaries"" as if I havent tried that, I'm going to scream. Eventually I feel so overwhelmed I just need to talk to someone who gets it. I call my dad.

Five years ago he defended mom. He said I needed to support her and understand where she's coming from. He said it was hurting her so she was the priority, my hurt didn't need to be considered. He said blood was thicker than water. 

A few days ago. He understood. He listened to me yell and rant and cry. He hugged me and said he was proud. He told me my first priority is my sobriety, and I need to focus on that even if it means not seeing mom for a while. I told him I'm exhausted by navigating conversation with her. He said he sees me do it and that I'm actually pretty good at it. He says he does it constantly too. I tell him I feel disrespected and he says he feels disrespected by her constant political nattering too. I say I feel so mad when I'm grey rocking her and it almost feels like she doubles down. Dad says she will just continue to get louder and louder until you're essentially forced to engage (ahem abuse). I say I'm so tired of going to therapy and reading self help books and going to group sessions on setting boundaries and attending support groups, just for her to sit at home arguing online with trolls on Twitter completely oblivious to how much emotional labour we all do to placate her. And he says he gets it and that it's not fair. 

And holy shit. Did I ever feel relieved. My dad gets it. Like, holy shit he gets it. I'll give him credit where it's due, five years ago he probably had no idea how to handle the situation. But he clearly listened. Because it seems he heard what I said 5 years ago and has actually been watching for it until now. So he heard me loud and clear. 

It's actually shocking. I've never been believed by my family before. I'm so grateful for his support. And I don't feel nearly as guilty for stepping back as I did last time, because my dad supports me this time. 

Anyways. Tomorrow is my birthday. I'm celebrating with my loving boyfriend and my adorable cats and just enjoying the mental space I get from not having to spend it with my narc mom.",13,1763223957.0,raisedbynarcissists,2,1.0,False

1oxvtr8,https://www.reddit.com/r/vampireacademy/comments/1oxvtr8/silver_shadows_thoughts/,Silver Shadows Thoughts,"Hi y’all,

So I took three days to finish Silver Shadows (from 11/7 to 11/9). I’m flipping my thoughts back and forth between Sydney and Adrian. Let me know if I missed anything!

1. I said this before, but re-education can fuck off, this is like conversion camps meet torture chambers
2. Screw the alchemists for taunting Sydney with Adrian’s cross, clothes (which is disgusting that they would watch her naked), food, coffee, shower, a bed, and then a visit from her family
3. Sydney, you need to eat.  The drug won’t be in the food, or everyone would pass out after they ate (but good thing you realize you aren’t pregnant)
4. Well, at least the drug is in the gas pumped into her (and all?) the room(s)
5. I get you want to rebel, but maybe play the game so you can dream and Adrian can find you? (Thank god you realized that and (were forced) said that you fell in love with a vampire)
6. Speaking of Adrian…my guy isn’t doing great.  Don’t drink yourself to death 🙁 (or fail your exams)
7. YOU MISSED JILL’S FASHION SHOW?!
8. Thank you Jill for letting Adrian’s mother about his condition
9. Back to Sydney, thank god she had a bath, but like, does she have to get her tattoo re-inked a little? At least she was protected with her magic
10.  Sheridan making it so that the others (prisoners, classmates?) in the re-education center don’t associate with Sydney by saying that she was tainted was diabolical
11. Sydney was very brave to express her opinion in support of the Moroi (to be fair, I would have done the same, but then stayed quiet and played the game), but also kinda dumb because she just got out of her cell
12.  And of course she gets punished by looking at pictures of happy Moroi, while having a drug injected that makes her want to vomit (classical conditioning at its finest)
13.  I don’t really like Emma, she seems like a tattletale 
14.  Hope got what was coming to her (but I feel bad about the types of punishments that re-education inflicts)
15.  I like Duncan, but like, what did he do?  He seems perfect
16.  I like how Emma helped Sydney figure out the gas system in the bedrooms
17.  Okay, so the gas is cut off, but Adrian didn’t come 🙁
18.  The wall of reflection and Sydney figuring out she is being held where Keith was
19.  Okay, let’s get back to Adrian
20.  So, in all of that time, he: 
21.  Continued drinking
22.  Made friends with Nina without realizing that she’s in love with him
23.  Kinda did a friends without benefits (because he never had sex with her and considered her a friend)
24.  Found out that his parents never loved each other (and begs his mom to leave his dad, but Daniella is worried about being cut off from the money and status)
25.  Continues to give Nina nice clothes and brings her to many many parties, and outs Wesley Drozdov as a fucking date rapist and shows the party crowd some spirit tricks
26.  Talked to Sonya (well, demanded at first) about Nina getting compensation for her time and help with the research for the spirit vaccine, in which he learned that Sonya was doing this without that many grants
27.  Had Nina kiss him in his room, and he tried to let her down easily (okay, it did not go well)
28.  Decided to go back to Palm Springs
29.  And THEN realized that Sydney is on a human sleep schedule instead of whatever the fuck his sleep schedule was
30.  Adrian finally reached Sydney, where she told him the information that she has and told him to talk to Carly (and told him to ask about the philosophy of Cicero)
31.  Adrian and Marcus go on a road trip! (I like Marcus now)
32.  Adrian and Marcus talk to Carly, and learn that Keith actually talked to her and asked her to turn him in, and she was like, no.
33.  Carly tells Marcus that Keith raped her, and Marcus seems to be impressed with the fact that Carly would rather let Keith live in fear of the Alchemists than turn him over to the police
34.  Road trip to find Keith, who actually gives them information regarding the dry heat, and with Adrian realizing that Sydney is still in the same time zone he’s in, that helps narrow down the search, a lot
35.  Jill invoking her royal status, and I don’t trust the blond woman
36.  Adrian can’t connect to Sydney 🙁
37.  Okay, back to Sydney
38.  She gets some salt and manages to charm it, gets a syringe (without getting caught), and uses it on Jonah before he gets re-inked
39.  IT WORKS
40.  Sydney, you’re going to get caught if you keep this up
41.  Sydney manages to:
42.  Have another torture punishment with a needle that makes you feel like your arm is burning in acid
43.  Steal some more syringes
44.  Use a guard’s ID card (which can be tracked, work smarter not harder please) to steal a bunch of salt and even more syringes
45.  Use invisibility and the guard’s ID card to sneak around at night, and uses magic to unlock doors and shut off the gas and water…and then immediately gets caught by Sheridan BECAUSE OF SAID ID CARD
46.  Sydney is brought to one of the rooms that was marked by a P, which turns out to be a persuasion room
47.  She actually holds out really well, until they bring Emma in and begin torturing Emma the same way
48.  Sydney finally confesses that she used magic and the torture amplifies (I’m sorry, the Alchemists are fucking sadists)
49. I forgot to add, that I think Olive is pregnant
50.  Adrian goes into a spirit dream with Marcus and pulls in Duncan and Emma, and Marcus points out that Duncan is the son of the Alchemist leaders
51.  YES, DUNCAN IS GOING TO HELP
52.  During the first half of breaking in: Hello, yes, we’re agents at *made up company acronym that I can’t remember*, and please mind the spirit that is hiding that I’m a vampire
53.  The fire alarm goes off and Marcus’s Alchemists round up the prisoners and escape with them, while also holding the Alchemists and guards at a standstill and zip-tying them
54.  Adrian and Eddie save Sydney and Chantal (Duncan’s first friend/love)
55.  Adrian and Sydney: Sure Marcus, we’ll meet you at the safe house *proceeds to lead the Alchemists on a wild goose chase, Sydney almost breaks her leg falling out a window, Sydney sets one or two fires, and Adrian and Sydney (invisible) stage a fight to escape*
56.  Adrian proposes to Sydney and I started crying
57.  ADRIAN PUTTING THE RUBIES IN THE WEDDING BAND
58.  Honestly, that was the quickest wedding ever, and Adrian keeps cheating at poker
59.  THANK YOU JILL FOR THE HELICOPTER 
60.  FUCK SHERIDAN FOR POINTING A GUN AT ADRIAN
61.  YES SYDNEY, WIELD THAT FIRE LIKE THE QUEEN YOU ARE!
62.  This is my wife (the guards just trying to rescue Adrian are like 😶😶😶😶)
63.  Lissa was probably thinking, *Adrian what have you done? I have such a headache now*
64.  Everyone being speechless about Sydney and Adrian being married, and Zoe being speechless
65.  Two *best* fucking father of the year awards go to: Nathan Ivashkov and Jared Sage for accepting the marriage (note the very, *very,* heavy sarcasm)
66.  THAT IS WHY YOUR WIFE IS GOING TO LEAVE YOU NATHAN….oh, I was kinda joking, but YES DANIELLA
67.  Ian being pissed
68.  Seriously, right before the vote about the age law is about to happen, JILL GOES MISSING?",1,1763223733.0,vampireacademy,0,0.67,False

Most of my classmates are immigrants too and barely know German, they anyway can't help me to learn the accent part. My interaction with locals is there but not to a very good extent. So anyone wants to meet for a walk or coffee in Bremen and speak in German? We can also go to a museum or somewhere as I love exploring. I can help you with English or Hindi (I'm completely fluent in both). I can also help if you're studying Political Science or History, I studied them at uni earlier. Anyone non-local with B2 or C1 is also most welcomed. I really gotta achieve complete fluency in German as otherwise unemployment is right at the door.

My 18 month old machine decided not to draw any coffee today. It’s regularly descaled and cleaned, but this is what has happened today and my conclusions:

Not the grinder - this stills functions normally.

Not the coffee - been using the same beans from the same company for several months.

I ground the coffee, moved the portafilter to the group, locked it in, pressed the 2-cup button and nothing comes through the p/filter into my cup. The water appears to have come out somewhere but is in the tray.

I took out the p/filter to knock out the puck and could see the very top of the puck is damp but majority is dry. 

Out of interest, I tried the milk wand, but water was coming out of the group. Not had that before.

I did a descale, then a clean - both appeared normal  but this is where I noticed the pressure gauge wasn’t moving. 

I’ve been googling this all day, watching YouTube etc but at a loss as to what to do next - I’m guessing I’ll try Sage customer service on Monday. 

Wonderful people of Reddit - any ideas?

1oxvq6u,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oxvq6u,"6,7 kg winter haulll","So I just got a shipment in and thought I'd drop a quick review of the quality on these pieces 'cause I'm actually shocked at how good everything is. My wallet is cryingggg but my closet is thanking me, you know how it goes lol

Dior blue down jacket
Man, this jacket is legit, the reversible design is fire and it feels super puffy and warm, perfect for the coming cold. The full monogram print on the other side is actually really subtle, not too flashy which I appreciate about the quality and material.

Stone Island jacket
The metallic nylon finish on this Stone Island puffer is just stunning in person; it catches the light so well and feels heavy-duty. It's properly thick and plush and is gonna keep me toasty without lookin like a giant marshmallow, definitely a good score.

SAINT MICHAEL Hoodie
If you like graphic tees, this hoodie is a must-have—the vintage American style and all-over graffiti print is crazy good. The detail on the 'Simpson/Madonna' design is crisp and the distressed fabric feels spot on like a genuinely old, worn-in favorite.

Thom hoodie
I picked up the zip-up version and the quality is definitely ""high version"" as advertised; the stitching on the signature four-bar stripe is totally flawless. It's a great weight for layering, you could wear it spring or fall easy, and sizing felt right.

Oakley sweatshirt
Really happy with this basic crewneck, the embroidery quality is top-notch and super clean—no loose threads or nothing. It's got that nice loose, casual fit, which is ideal for just lounging or grabbing coffee.

Canada goose vest
Don't sleep on this vest, it's way thicker than I expected and the ""export quality"" tag seems right because the construction is super solid. It's all about that warmth without the bulk, gonna be my new go-to for chilly mornings.

Stussy Beanie
Needed a solid beanie for winter, and this one fits my big head perfectly, which is always a struggle, lol. The knit is really tight and soft, plus the simple logo makes it easy to rock with anything.

Dior Scarf
Godd this scarf feels really luxurious, the wool/cashmere blend is seriously soft and the double-sided print is a nice touch for versatility. The subtle ""D"" logo and tassels make it look high-end, and it's definitely big enough to wear like a proper shawl or wrap.

I'm having a bizarre issue that requires either an exorcism, a medical professional, or something else. Hoping for ""something else"".

About three or four(ish) months ago I noticed all the tea I make comes out tasting more like hot water with tea flavor instead of just...you know, tea. I've drank tea the same way for at least ten years now: skim milk, which I know doesn't do much for flavor/texture but I'm used to it, plus two sweeteners (equal) and always filtered water. I use fairly standard sized mugs (coffee/diner cup size) and drink the same tea brands I always have. For bagged tea I rotate mainly through Twinings, Bigelow, Taylors, Stash and for when I'm feeling really basic: Lipton (yes, I'm American and don't know the finer teas in life so I make do with what I have). Loose leaf I've mainly used Tiesta and whatever has been randomly gifted to me over the years. I mainly drink black but switch it up with herbal, white and green every so often (maybe even oolong if I'm feeling fancy). I use the appropriate temperature for each type with an electric kettle.

The problem is, *all* of them have the same ""hot water"" type taste. It's missing the ""oomph"" I'm used to. I've experimented with steep times (I've always just left bagged teas in the cup until the cup is finished but have tried doing the recommended 3-5 minutes for black), switching skim milk out for 1%, descaling the kettle, using a regular gas stove with a traditional kettle, using bottled water instead of house filtered, buying new tea in case the old ones were ""stale"", using different amounts of water so the tea isn't too diluted or overly concentrated, and still, nothing. At first I suspected maybe I had covid and my taste buds got thrown off (also used zicam during a cold a few months back as well which also can mess things up I've heard) but literally everything else I drink/eat tastes as it ""should"". I was thinking maybe tea is just off to me now but I went out for breakfast about three weeks ago (which I usually never do) and had what they served for tea. It was just a standard Lipton....and it tasted *fantastic*. Which baffled me because I've always found Lipton to be just ""okay"". So now I'm just completely confused on what is going on here.

And now I'm left with my only reasonable theory on what's going on: the house I'm living in is now cursed by tea demons that have damned every conceivable cup of tea made here for all time. Other theories would be welcome as I'm not entirely thrilled about my own. Thanks in advance.",2,1763223473.0,tea,16,0.58,False

Alright, serious question (but also not really):

Which vocation in Tibia actually feels smooth to play in 2025, and not like I’m wrestling a shopping cart with one broken wheel?

Because honestly, every time I try a new vocation, I reach that point around level 700+ where I’m like:

“Is this fun… or am I just developing new forms of stress?”

Let’s break it down:

- Knights: Amazing solo players… until it hits you that your entire gameplay is basically spamming SMPs like an addict, stomping your gaming foot pedal like you’re trying to summon a demon, and doing the exact same rotation for 300 levels straight. Difficulty curve? Bro, it’s flatter than Rookgaard.

- Paladins: Sometimes smooth as butter… and sometimes your cooldowns feel like they were coded on a Monday morning before coffee.

- Mages: Either absolute chef’s kiss perfection… or you’re playing a fun little game called “How fast can I zone out, misclick, and delete myself?”

-Monks: just delete


I just want to know which vocation feels the LEAST clunky and the MOST “I’m actually enjoying myself” right now for you?

Like — the one where you can hunt for 3 hours straight without questioning your life choices.
