# Being Lady Luck was not just a title; it was a relentless burden. After much contemplation, I resolved to experience life anew as a privileged heiress, a position that promised ease and indulgence.

Yet, fate had other plans. My mother had been disowned by her affluent family, all because she had failed to bear a son.

My father, Nathan Hoffman, regarded her growing belly with a look of utter disdain, as if it were a mere inconvenience. “Stop wasting your energy. You’ll never have a son,” he declared coldly, his voice laced with a harsh finality.

The color drained from my mother’s face, a palpable wave of despair washing over her. “No… I’ll give you a son…” she whispered, desperation creeping into her tone.

I felt an overwhelming wave of sympathy for her in that moment. It was then that I resolved to help her acquire 1.5 billion dollars—an amount that might just impress those heartless individuals who had turned their backs on her.

\*\*\*

My name is Meredith Hoffman. In my previous existence, I was known as Lady Luck, a being who wielded fortune like a weapon.

In this life, however, my aspirations were more grounded. I simply wished to be a wealthy heiress, basking in luxury and pleasure.

I found myself reincarnated within the womb of Chelsea Terrell, a woman caught in a web of familial expectations and societal pressures.

And here I was, still a girl.

My father, Nathan Hoffman, a titan in the world of business with a net worth in the billions, was fixated on the idea of a male heir to carry forth his legacy.

At this moment, I floated in warm amniotic fluid, enveloped in a cocoon of safety, while the muffled sounds of my mother’s quiet sobs echoed around me.

Seated across from her was my grandmother, Matilda Hoffman, a woman whose presence radiated authority. She cradled a coffee cup in her hands, leisurely skimming the foam as if time were an endless resource.

“Chelsea, what Nathan says goes for me, too,” she stated, her tone devoid of warmth.

“You need to abort this child.”

My mother’s sobs ceased abruptly.

She lifted her head, her eyes swollen and red, her voice trembling as she pleaded, “Matilda, the ultrasound can be wrong, can’t it? What if… What if I’m carrying a son?”

Matilda’s patience snapped as she slammed her coffee cup down on the table, the sound reverberating through the room like a thunderclap.

“No what ifs.

“Lorelei is four months pregnant. The doctor checked and confirmed it’s a boy.”

Lorelei Sutton was my father’s mistress, a fact that twisted like a knife in my mother’s heart.

Mom gripped her dress so tightly that her knuckles turned ghostly white.

“Just because she’s having a son, I have to get rid of my unborn baby?” she challenged, her voice rising with indignation.

A cold voice sliced through the tension from the doorway. “Yes!”

It was Nathan, striding in with an air of authority that chilled the room.

He fixed his gaze on my mother, his eyes devoid of any warmth or compassion. “Chelsea, don’t make this awkward for yourself,” he admonished.

With a swift motion, he retrieved a document from his suit pocket and tossed it onto the table with a casual flick of his wrist.

“Sign it, and this villa plus 1.5 million dollars are yours. It’s more than enough to ensure you live in comfort for the rest of your life.”

My mother’s eyes locked onto the document, the words “Divorce Agreement” searing into her mind like a brand.

Her body swayed, and for a moment, it seemed as though she might collapse under the weight of his betrayal.

1.5 million dollars.

To rid himself of his wife, who was seven months pregnant with his child.

How generous of him.

Mom let out a bitter laugh, a sound that was more of a choked sob than anything else. “Nathan, this is your child, too.

“How could you be so heartless?”

Nathan frowned, clearly irritated by her emotional response.

“I told you we needed a male heir.

“If you can’t give birth to a son, you have to step aside.”

His tone dripped with self-righteousness, an arrogance that made my heart ache for my mother.

In that moment, I could feel her heart racing, a sharp, overwhelming pain piercing through the amniotic fluid that surrounded me.

No. She couldn’t remain passive in the face of such cruelty.

I focused all my energy, sending a thought directly into her mind.

“Mom, don’t cry.

“Agree to the divorce first. Just hold them off.”

Mom froze, her eyes wide with shock.

She looked around as if searching for the source of the voice.

“You can’t see me. I’m in your belly.

“I’m your daughter, and I’m Lady Luck, here to help you.”

Her eyes widened further, a mixture of disbelief and awe washing over her.

Instinctively, she placed a trembling hand on her belly, as if to connect with me.

Matilda, growing impatient with the silence, interjected sharply.

“Chelsea, you have one day to think about it.

“If you haven’t signed by this time tomorrow, you’ll regret it.”

With that, she and Nathan turned on their heels, leaving my mother alone in the room, the door clicking shut behind them.

Mom stood there, frozen in place, the weight of their words heavy in the air.

After what felt like an eternity, she finally spoke, her voice quivering. “You… you were the one talking to me just now?”

“Yes. Mom, it’s me,” I replied, my voice a steady beacon in the storm of her emotions.

“Don’t be scared. I’m with you. No one can bully us.”

Tears began to fall from her eyes again, but this time they were tinged with hope rather than despair.

She wiped them away, her resolve hardening as she picked up the divorce agreement from the table and tore it into shreds, the sound of paper ripping echoing like a declaration of war.

She murmured defiantly, “Do you think you can cast us aside with just 1.5 million dollars? Not a chance!”

“Mom, open your stock trading app,” I instructed her, my voice firm.

“Do as I say—go all in on stock code 002594.”

This mental connection drained me more than I anticipated, but I knew that my mother’s stunned expression was a testament to her realization that the guidance from her unborn daughter was her only lifeline.

With a shaky breath, she poured her last 15,000 dollars into that stock, her heart racing with a mix of fear and hope.

After placing her bet, she collapsed onto the sofa, her palms clammy with sweat, the weight of her decision pressing down on her.

The following day, the stock market opened with a bang.

That stock soared unexpectedly, breaking through daily limits one, two, and three times in a row.

In just three days, her initial investment of 15,000 dollars had transformed into a staggering 30,000 dollars.

Chelsea stared at the numbers in her account, her hands trembling with excitement, her heart pounding with disbelief.

For the first time, she truly felt the extraordinary power that coursed through me, a power that could change everything.",1,1764044263.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

A laptop stand for travel might be exactly what you need to fix these problems.

**Why You Should Consider a Travel Laptop Stand**

Let's be real – airports, coffee shops, and hotel rooms aren't designed for comfortable laptop use. You end up hunching over your screen for hours, which messes up your posture big time. A portable laptop stand lifts your screen to eye level, so you're not killing your neck and shoulders every time you work.

The best part? Modern travel stands are super lightweight and compact. They fold up small enough to slip into your backpack without adding much weight. You won't even notice it's there until you need it.

**Real Benefits You'll Actually Notice**

Better airflow is a huge plus. Laptops get hot when they're flat on a surface, which can slow down performance. An elevated stand lets air circulate underneath, keeping your device cooler and running smoother.

You also get better typing angles. Most stands let you adjust the height and tilt, so you can find what works for your setup. Whether you're using an external keyboard or typing directly on your laptop, the ergonomic position makes a difference.

**What to Look For**

You want something sturdy but portable. Aluminum stands are popular because they're strong without being heavy. Look for stands that are adjustable and have rubber grips to prevent slipping.

Foldable designs work best for travel since they pack flat. Some even come with a carrying case, which keeps everything organized in your bag.

**Is It Worth Your Money?**

If you travel for work regularly or spend hours at random workspaces, absolutely. The comfort improvement alone pays for itself. Plus, protecting your laptop from overheating can extend its lifespan, which saves you money down the road.

You can check out different options for [laptop stands here](https://athomewave.com/laptop-stand) to see what fits your needs and budget.

**Bottom Line**

A laptop stand for travel isn't some fancy gadget you don't need. It's a practical tool that makes working remotely way more comfortable. Your neck and back will thank you, your laptop will run cooler, and you'll actually enjoy working from different places.

Whether you're a digital nomad, frequent business traveler, or just someone who works from cafes on weekends, having a portable laptop stand in your bag is smart. They're affordable, easy to use, and solve real problems that every laptop user faces.

Yesterday we broke down the difference between drift and freeze.
Today is the “why” — why it happens, and why separating roles matters so much.

Here’s the clearest explanation I know.

⸻

A beginner-friendly example

A) When you write everything in one block

“Explain like a teacher, make it a little fun, keep it short,
think step-by-step, be formal, be friendly, and sound like an expert.”

→ GPT merges all of that into one personality  
→ The reply style becomes fixed  
→ Everything after that looks the same  
→ **Freeze**

⸻

B) When you separate the roles

**Identity:** “You are a calm explainer.”  
**Task:** “Explain this topic in 5 steps.”  
**Tone:** “Add a slightly friendly note at the end only.”

→ Identity stays stable  
→ Logic stays in steps  
→ Tone appears only where it should  
→ Replies stay consistent

That’s structure.

⸻

Why role-separation actually works

It prevents **instruction fusion** — the model’s tendency to collapse multiple rules into one.

The danger moment is when GPT internally decides:

> “Oh, these rules all mean the same thing. I’ll merge them.”

Once it merges them, it’s like pouring milk into coffee:  
you can’t un-mix it.

**Structure acts as a shield that stops blending before it starts.**

1p62mlx,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1p62mlx/where_the_fog_settles_first/,Where the Fog Settles First,"The fog in Morro Bay isn't like other fog. It doesn't just roll in; it claims. It spills over the green hills to the west, consumes the sandspit, and smothers the three-stacked giant that sleeps by the water. It wraps Morro Rock in a grey shroud, silencing the gulls and sea lions, until the only sounds left are the mournful, two-tone groan of the buoy horn and the clang of the bell at the harbor mouth.

Piper knew this fog. She was born in it, breathed it in like a second air. It was in her blood, a cold inheritance passed down from a line of women who had all, at one time or another, been called ""fog-touched.""

She was wiping down the espresso machine at The Drift, the cafe on the Embarcadero, when he'd first spoken to her. The last tourists had long since scattered, driven back to their motels by the impenetrable wall of white that now stood where the bay should have been.

He was new. You could always tell. He wore a technical jacket, unwisely thin for the damp, and carried a camera bag that was worth more than her car.

""It's incredible,"" he said, gesturing to the window. All Piper could see was their own reflections, pale ghosts in the warm light of the cafe. ""The way it just erases the world. I'm Lucas, by the way. I'm a photographer. I'm here to shoot the Rock.""

""You won't see it tonight,"" Piper said, her voice flat. She emptied the coffee grounds with a sharp thwack.

""Oh, I don't want to see it,"" Lucas said, his smile eager, misplaced. ""I want to shoot it in this. The mood, the mystery... it’s primeval.""

A cold finger, entirely separate from the draft by the door, traced its way down Piper's spine. ""The fog isn't a mood. It's a... presence. It has habits. You shouldn't be out in it.""

He chuckled, a dry, dismissive sound. ""I'm not afraid of a little weather, Piper. I've shot in blizzards, in sandstorms. This is just water vapor.""

""No,"" she said, turning to face him fully. Her eyes, the color of sea-glass, held his. ""It's not. It has low places and high places. It has currents. And it has places it likes to... pool. You're a photographer. You understand light. Think of this as shadow. And you don't want to be caught in the deepest part of it.""

""And where's that?"" he asked, intrigued, leaning on the counter. ""I'd love to get a shot from there. Where's the 'deepest part'?""

Piper leaned in, her voice dropping to a whisper that was suddenly colder than the air outside. ""You don't find it. It finds you. But it always starts in one place. My grandmother used to say, 'Never be out when the fog is high on the Rock but the base is clear. That's when it's looking.' And never, ever,"" her gaze flicked to the dark window, ""go where the fog settles first.""

Lucas was quiet for a moment, his journalistic curiosity warring with the sudden, primal unease she'd sparked in him. ""That's a great line. Very gothic. So, where is it?""

""It's not a place on a map,"" Piper said, turning back to her machine. ""It's a place on the clock. And it's almost that time.""

""Right. Well,"" he slung his bag over his shoulder. ""Thanks for the coffee. And the local color.""

He left. The bell on the door tinkled a tiny, cheerful farewell that the fog immediately swallowed. Piper locked the door behind him, her knuckles white. She watched his silhouette dissolve into the grey in less than ten paces.

""He'll look for it,"" she whispered to her own reflection. ""He thinks it's a game.""

Two days passed. The fog stayed, a stubborn, unmoving weight on the town. It thinned in the afternoons to a hazy, sunless glare, then rushed back in at dusk with a predatory speed. Lucas came in both mornings, buzzing with new energy.

""You were right!"" he'd called out on the first day, shaking water from his jacket. ""This stuff is alive. I was out on the sandspit at dawn. It moves in patterns. Eddies, currents, just like you said. It's... it's like nothing I've ever seen. But I still haven't found your 'spot'.""

""You won't,"" Piper said, handing him his coffee. ""Stay on the sandspit. It's safer there. It's new land. The fog... it likes older places.""

On the second day, he brought an old fisherman with him, a man named Tio, whose face was a roadmap of sun and sea.

""This one,"" Tio said, jerking a thumb at Lucas, ""he's been asking everyone. 'Where the fog settles first.' I told him he's a fool. I told him some things are just stories. He won't listen.""

""It's the story,"" Lucas insisted, his eyes bright. ""The one everyone hints at, but no one will tell. I heard it from a woman at the history museum. She said it's not a place, it's a thing. A hollow. A memory. Something that happened.""

Piper felt the blood drain from her face. ""Stay away from the power plant. The stacks. Just... stay away.""

""Why?"" Lucas pressed. ""Is that it? The old Chumash stories? The 'Dark Watchers'?""

""This is older than that,"" Piper said, her voice shaking. ""This is before them. Before anyone. It's the thing they warned their children about. It's not a watcher. It's a taker.""

Tio crossed himself, a gesture so quick Piper almost missed it. ""She's right, boy. You're playing with something that doesn't know the rules. You go out tonight, you're not coming back. Not all of you.""

Lucas just paid for his coffee and left, a tight, determined set to his jaw.

""He'll go tonight,"" Tio said quietly, staring into the white void outside.

""I know,"" Piper replied. ""He thinks it's near the stacks. He's wrong. It's just... that's where you can see it from.""

""He'll go to the tide pools,"" Tio breathed. ""North of the Rock. By the old pier pilings.""

Piper nodded, her stomach a knot of ice. ""Where the currents cross. It pulls the fog down, right at the water line. It's the first place the mist touches land, every single time. It settles there before it even reaches the beach.""

That night, Piper didn't go home. She closed the shop at eight, the fog so thick it was pressing against the glass like a living thing. The buoy horn's groan was muffled, choked, as if the fog was squeezing the sound out of it.

She knew the look. The fog was high on the Rock, a heavy, suffocating crown, but she could just make out the dark, wet gleam of the base. That's when it's looking.

She grabbed her heaviest jacket and a flashlight, its beam a pathetic, diffuse cone that barely cut three feet into the white. She didn't drive. She walked, moving by sound and memory along the dark harbor walk, past the silent charter boats, their masts disappearing into an unseen sky

She headed north, past the Rock, her feet hitting the sand. The surf was a deafening, invisible roar to her left. The air was impossibly cold, impossibly still. There was no wind. The fog moved on its own.

She found his tripod first. It was set up on a patch of wet, black sand, pointed at a small cove formed by algae-slick boulders. A place no tourist would ever find.

""Lucas!"" she yelled. Her voice was flat, absorbed instantly by the sound-deadening blanket of the mist.

She saw a light. A weak, flickering glow, just ahead, near the water line. It was his camera. The screen was on, cycling through the pictures he'd just taken.

She ran toward it, splashing through the shallow, icy water that filled the pools. ""Lucas!""

He was there.

He was standing, ankle-deep in the surge, just beyond the last of the boulders. He was perfectly still, his back to her. He was staring out at the water, or rather, at the place where the water and the fog became one.

""Lucas, get out of the water!"" she screamed. He didn't turn.

""It's beautiful,"" he whispered. His voice was... wrong. It was thin, reedy, but also seemed to come from three places at once. ""It's finally here.""

""What's here, Lucas? We have to go. Now!"" She grabbed his arm.

It was then that she saw them.

They were in the fog. Or they were the fog. It was hard to tell.

At first, she thought they were just shapes, darker patches of grey in the grey. But they moved. They were tall, impossibly thin, their limbs too long, bending at angles that made her stomach clench. They had no faces, just hollows, deeper shadows where features should be. They drifted from the sea, coalescing out of the mist, their forms stabilizing as they neared the shore. They were silent, but she could feel them, a vibration in her teeth, a deep, sub-audible hum that was the sound of intense cold.

There were dozens of them. They were moving past Lucas, ignoring him, heading for the beach. Heading for the town.

It's not a watcher. It's a taker.

""Lucas!"" She tugged his arm, but it was like pulling at a statue. He was rigid, mesmerized.

He slowly turned his head. His eyes were wide, vacant. And they were a pale, milky grey.

""They've been waiting so long,"" he whispered, that terrible, layered voice echoing from his throat. ""They're so cold. They just want to get... inside.""

One of the shapes stopped. It was taller than the rest, its form less mist and more solid shadow. It turned, a slow, impossible rotation of a limbless torso. It 'looked' at them.

Piper felt a cold that wasn't physical. It was a cold of the soul, a void that pulled at her.

The shape drifted closer. It had no hands, but she felt a grip on her mind. Let go, a 'voice' said, not in her ears, but in her skull. He is ours. We have waited. We are the first. We are the last.

Lucas raised his camera, his hands moving with a jerky, puppet-like motion. He tried to take a picture.

The tall shape was in front of them now. It raised an arm-like appendage. It did not touch the camera. It simply passed its shadow-hand through it.

The camera's screen went black. A spiderweb of cracks appeared on the lens, and a wisp of grey-white vapor, like a tiny puff of fog, escaped from the camera body.

Lucas made a small, choking sound.

That was what broke the spell. The small, human sound.

Piper didn't think. She acted. She planted her feet in the sand, grabbed the front of Lucas's jacket with both hands, and pulled. She fell backward, dragging him with her, out of the water, onto the wet sand.

The tall shadow surged forward. It let out a sound. A sound like the foghorn, the clang of the bell, and a thousand dying whispers all at once. The other shapes stopped their procession and turned.

Piper scrambled, dragging Lucas, who was now limp, a dead weight. ""The Rock sees you!"" she screamed, the old words, her grandmother's words, tearing from her throat. ""The shore holds you! You can't have him!""

The shapes recoiled, as if she had struck them. The fog around them thinned, swirling violently. The tall one loomed, its shadow falling over them, and for a second, Piper saw what was inside the hollow of its face: a swirling constellation of tiny, cold, blue lights, like captured stars.

Then they were gone. They didn't retreat. They just dissolved, blending back into the greater fog, which suddenly, violently, rushed inland. The wind howled for a single second, and then... silence.

Just the surf. Just the two-tone horn.

Lucas gasped, a huge, shuddering intake of breath. He was shivering, his eyes clear, blinking in terror. ""Piper? What... what happened? I was... I was just setting up. The fog..."" He looked at his feet, at the sand, at the dark, empty cove. ""I... I don't remember.""

Piper, panting, her heart hammering so hard it hurt, just shook her head. ""The fog came in. You slipped. You hit your head.""

She helped him to his feet. He was dazed, compliant. He didn't even look for his camera. She walked him back to the street, under the weak, haloed glow of the lights, and put him in a cab. He was gone the next morning. No one ever saw him again.

A week later, Piper was locking up The Drift. The fog was back, thick as wool. She felt like she hadn't been warm in seven days. She carried a new fear with her, a cold, hard knot in her stomach. She knew what she had seen. She knew what she had done.

She turned to set the alarm. A sound made her freeze.

A soft, wet shuffling from the back stockroom. Like bare feet on wet tile.

""Hello?"" she called out, her voice a thin thread.

The lights in the cafe flickered. One by one, they buzzed and went out, plunging the room into the near-darkness of the fog-lit street.

She backed against the door, fumbling for the lock.

A figure emerged from the stockroom doorway. It was tall, impossibly thin, and silhouetted against the dark. It dripped, leaving dark, oily puddles on the floor. It was a solid, physical thing now.

It raised a long, thin arm. In its hand, it held something small and black.

It was Lucas's camera.

It took a step, and the light from the streetlamp outside briefly illuminated its face. It was a face of smooth, grey, wet skin, like a drowned man's. But the eyes... the eyes were two hollows, filled with a swirling, churning fog.

It whispered, and the voice was the foghorn, the bell, and the cold, empty sea. ""You... forgot... this.""

Venting)","I told my closest friend that he had threatened to kill our dog and detailed the ways he wanted to torture her, and all she said was that “he might need therapy.”

I told my family that he was an alcoholic and said terrible things and they mostly felt like they should keep their mouths shut. In fact, they often tell him thank you for putting up with me, or act like I’m difficult and should be grateful for him.

My therapist (who was also my psychiatrist) said he was “a jackass” but not abusive. 

I did reach out for help. I did not get help. He never physically hit me. He did isolate me, scream at me, punch objects and the bed near my head, he did grab me, pin me down, scream at me, he did drink and belittle some of the most vulnerable things I told him.

My friends saw him at parties, screaming at me for talking to a family friend (who was 16), punching holes in my door and lying, running away drunk. Everyone laughed! Like, what a silly man!

From there it escalated, drunk nights, grabbing me, screaming at me. When I’d bring up what he did, I felt crazy. I demanded an apology one night after he grabbed my wrist and couldn’t let me go. And he screamed at me and acted like I was stupid, he got this smirk on his face. 

And discussion about my emotions or hurt, he became (and still does, to this day) defensive, he pins it back on me, denies, says I’m dramatic, says it didn’t happen, says that his anger is an emotion and he should be allowed to have emotions since I have so many (my many being sadness and crying.) 


About five years into this, after a particularly bad night—one where some coworkers had sent be a disgusting sexual text and then made fun of me at a work party—he picked me up drunk and called me a fucking idiot, stupid, a dumbass the whole ride home. Just screaming at me. I tried to jump out of the car. I was at my lowest and, I guess because he felt threatened by other men sexually mocking me, decided to take it out on me and berate and scream at me the 30 minute ride home. 

My brain switched. I applied to a job out of state. I didn’t break up with him, and didn’t really have plans to, but subconsciously, I think I knew I needed out. I met someone else almost immediately, and broke up with him. Was this healthy? No, it was a cliche, and another abusive relationship. Even worse than him. But everyone acted like I was evil, I was even called manic by my psychiatrist. 

Then he began texting me every day, acting so sweet. Honestly, not that sweet, he’d come to visit and meet me with cold anger if I didn’t have sex with him. But compared to the other person, I thought I had misjudged, and that he really was a truly great man. So I got back together with him, and my escape was talked about as if it was a mistake on my end, as if I was the evil and bad one for cheating on him. It’s not like I knowingly cheated on him for months. I moved, I met someone else, and I immediately called him and broke it off. My family thanked him for “staying with me”.

When I moved back with him, a year later it started again. The resentment. He stopped coming home at night. He started drinking. I went through something extremely traumatic with my mom, and he completely disengaged, wouldn’t and couldn’t be there for me. I got sick with 104 fever and had to drive myself to the doctor. He began to get aggressive again, hitting the bed, punishing me for not having sex with cold silence. 

I fell into a deep depression. I once again “escaped,” this time I made sure to break up with him first, then move out, and then immediately found another man, 10 years my senior, who wanted to marry and impregnate me immediately. Luckily, I caught on quickly that this was abusive, and ran back to my ex. Actually, funny thing about that, my therapist was encouraging that I move in quickly with this other man, and it was only my own intuition that saved me. As bad as my current relationship is, I think this one would have been even worse. I guess that’s my problem, the times I’ve escaped, because I’m so damaged and insecure, I find men that are even worse. And I think, well, I must be lucky to have someone that doesn’t outright physically and sexually abuse me. 

Was I toxic? Absolutely. I blame myself for this. I grew up with a father who abused my mom. And with a mom who was an alcoholic and literally schizoaffective I don’t know what stability is, I am terrified of being neglected. So I jump from one abusive man to another. And I. Many ways, I’m just as toxic as them. Except I do not yell, belittle, or intimidate  them. 

After I came back this next time, he hated me with. Passion. I don’t really blame him at this point. I don’t know what either of us were doing. I was becoming just as toxic as he was. I never yelled or belittled him, but I did continuously try and escape by finding another man, then coming back. (Those two times).

Now I hated myself, thought I was an evil slut. This led to the worse period of my life, mixed with Covid. He hated me too. I had no hope of anything else, this is what I deserved, better than what I deserved. I stopped wearing makeup. I had long stopped trying to have friends (he would show up to gatherings angrily, or if invited, make everyone uncomfortable by not engaging and being angry on the side. It was easier to not have friends). 

I convinced myself I was crazy, and my psychiatrist was very happy to agree. I really liked seroquel, because it completely knocked me out. I took as much seroquel as I could a day, literally drooling for months. 

He was angry with how I cleaned. I would clean, and he would tell me I was doing it incorrectly. So I started asking him if I was doing it wrong? And he got angry at me for being so sheepish. I asked if he was mad at me 10-20x a day, and he became enraged that I kept asking him. I would ask and then immediately apologize. He didn’t like to see the result of his abuse he didn’t like how small and sheepish I became, because it made him, even if for a small moment, reflect on himself, it was a mirror for him. 

It’s true I was messy, I would leave dishes in the sink, he would tell me to wash them, I would wash them incorrectly. I felt scared to clean around him, because I knew he would have something to say. I started ordering food so that I didn’t have to be in the kitchen. 

I didn’t even imagine there was abuse until he started to threaten our puppy, she would pee and he would get enraged, curl his lips back like he does, and scream at her and throw her in her kennel. I told him at one point that I preferred he didn’t say violent things around me (like about neighbors or people on the highway and how he hopes they crash and die). That very night, he detailed out how he wanted to hurt her. He seemed to be smiling. He said he would dig a barrier around our yard, and bury shards of glass, and barbed wire, and that way when she dug… and maybe she’d even eat shards of glass and die and cry. He took a lot of glee in this.


Looking back, there are a lot of outright abusive things he did that I won’t copy here, I’m trying to not “prove” myself to an audience, but things just as bad at this that I never recognized as abuse, simply because they were towards me. It wasn’t until he said this about our puppy that I realized that he might be abusive. It’s like all of the puzzle pieces came together and I saw clearly. 

That’s the first time I texted my friend, and she told me maybe he just needed therapy. 


The truth is, in the south, abuse is normal. My mom was abused. My brother is abusive to all of his girlfriends. My friend that I texted had an abusive boyfriend and an abusive father. In fact, my partner is not even half as bad as many of the men in mine and the people I knows life. That’s the truth. So they cannot admit there is a problem, their whole world falls apart. My whole world falls apart, when I think of my father, and my first boyfriend, my second boyfriend, my current husband. There has been one, non abusive boyfriend in my life, and I wasn’t attracted to him. Because to me, pain=love. If there is no pain, I can’t interpret love.

This was me venting. Sorry for the long story as I process things. Sometimes I convince myself that I’m the problem. I know that in many ways I am. I take responsibility for what I did to myself and to others. But when I read my diaries, all of these things I forgot, I feel so sick, I start shaking, it’s like my world is crumbling around me, like someone has died, because to admit it is abuse… is to admit my entire reality, every loved one, every avenue of support.. All of them are balanced on abuse.

This reality, that I’m the evil bad one, that I’m terrible. This is a reality many have to believe, because otherwise they have to admit that even things that aren’t as bad as what they experience are abuse, and so they have to admit they are abused. 

It is easier for me to see myself as the bad one. The one who needs to be medicated, the one who has problems, the one who did all the wrong. It is, almost, preferable to me. Because then it’s a reality  I know, a delusional reality. Where my husband is actually a patient and kind man who has to put up with an unstable woman. See how nice he is! How patient! See how much he loves me, to stay with me through it all! And if I pull back the veil, I see a woman who has no self esteem, who has abandoned herself, who others have been happy to watch scapegoat herself into insanity. I see a man who objectively hates her, who has no empathy, who controls her through rage and intimidation and anger. A man who resentfully brings her coffee every morning, so that when she says “please, can we talk about the way you spoke to me this morning? Please try not to be defensive, I’m not saying this to blame you, I just feel bad, can we talk about it” can slit back “LOOK AT EVERYTHING I DO FOR YOU! LOOK AT WHAT IVE PUT UP WITH! WHAT DO YOU DO? WHAT DO YOU BRING TO THE TABLE??”

A man who has so criticized every aspect of my life and what I do, that I feel incapable of doing anything. Of taking care of my dogs, of cleaning, of taking a shower, of being able to wake up on time, of being able to take care of myself in anyway. Completely and wholly dependent, and then belittled for being so.


I cannot believe the mindfuck I’ve lived my entire life. I have to commit to myself to break this pattern for good. I have to break this pattern. I do not want to be part of this anymore.",1,1764043144.0,abusiverelationships,1,1.0,False

TRIGGER WARNING ABUSE


I’ve reached the end of my rope. I have a young child whose father and I are divorced. In my marriage I was manipulated, I was SA’d and abused in every sense of the word. I have had such a hard time navigating life since then, I’m mad a lot, I’m overstimulated constantly, and I have fought hard to try to not be that way. This is all important to the story.

I’ve noticed since the start, my boyfriend will fake cry, whimper almost, to make me feel bad for him. He almost craves sympathy in everything he does, and if I don’t give him that and baby him in a sense, he gets very angry very quickly. When I mention it though, or I get tired of it and snap back, I’m the one who needs to apologize and who is the bad guy. I know I shouldn’t snap, and I accept my faults also, but I feel as though I’ve been through this before and I’m terrified because I know what comes next…

I’m the one expected to spend money when we go to eat, when we get groceries (we don’t live together, but he eats at my house 90% of the time.) my vehicle is always used when we do things together and I am the only one paying for gas. When he’s asked to use his money it’s either an excuse as to why he can’t, or he gets extremely passive aggressive about it.

Another important thing to note, I have a panic disorder that I’ve been diagnosed with. I am managing without medication due to BF and am about to go back on my medication since my LO is weaning. Now, I have bitten my tongue A LOT about things, and it’s made me somewhat bitter. I’ve been snappy the last couple of days, and it all came to a head yesterday. I was trying to speak to my boyfriend, and I told him I didn’t believe that what he thought would fix a dishwasher would work, but I wouldn’t mind to try. He threw his hands up like a toddler, and rolled his eyes because his idea was challenged. I went to my room and locked the door to give us both a chance to cool down.

He comes to my door about 10 minutes later and I let him in as he wants to talk. I told him it probably wasn’t the best idea at that moment as I was still upset, but he told me he didn’t care and he wanted to talk right then. He then proceeded to yell at me about how mean I was and how I never apologize and I’m nothing but mean. I listed each and every time I’ve apologized, and he admitted that I did apologize, he “just wasn’t thinking about those times”. What followed was one of the worst panic attacks of the year after he yelled at me and then started the fake cry, exactly how my ex did it (he was aware of this) and it felt as though I was teleported to all of the things I went through before. 

I’ve thought about it since. I am the only one who ever apologizes, even when it’s him being hateful or mean, I’m the one apologizing. I’m always in the wrong for having a bad attitude, even after I’ve told him I need him to stop doing what he’s doing momentarily or I need him to explain something better because I’m becoming extremely overwhelmed and it’s getting to a bad point, and he disregards me. He tells people we split expenses evenly, but I could count on one hand the things he’s paid for in the last 9 months. And then there’s the flowers, every time it gets a little rocky, there are flowers, or coffee, or something along those lines. He will pick up/play with my child, but only when I’m in the room or am about to walk in the room. 

I’m so terrified of going through everything again, and I can’t bring someone in my child’s life who is going to be exactly like his biological father. He’s never hit me, or SA’d me… But neither had my ex until we were married. I know I need to talk to him about this, but I just don’t know how to go about it, and how to proceed afterwards.",0,1764043117.0,Advice,5,0.5,False

Another week another review. This week I am back with Dunu again. Well, I was blessed with another Dunu iem specifically Dunu Vulkan2. This is interesting iem. It is a hybrid & open back faceplate. So, me being curious person agreed to review it. Here we are at it.

First of all, thank you to SushiFi and Dunu for making this review possible. Without their help this review wouldn’t have been possible.

All opinions and thoughts are mine. I have not been paid or offered any compensation for the review.

Please keep in mind my bias towards DD sets. My preferences are DD>Hybrids>Planars. Also, my music choices. Please refer to my music genre section.

Now that all pleasantries have been done with Let’s get to meat and potatoes of review.

Build Quality:

What you get in the box

1 pair of iems

1 modular cable with 3.5 mm & 4.4 mm terminations

4 pairs of Dunu S & S ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu Candy ear tips

3 pairs of Dunu standard tips

1 cleaning tool

1 cleaning cloth

1 pair iem booties

1 Carrying case

As you can see Dunu has been generous towards included accessories. Dunu never disappoints in this department. Totally premium package.

Iem shells are made of cnc machined aerospace grade aluminium. They feel solid in hand. Faceplate has slats with mesh covering them. This is where it being open back stems from. Shells are medium size. Nozzles are also metal. Nozzles have lip on them. This helps gripping ear tips well. No risk of ear tips slipping off here. Nozzle length is adequate and provide deep insertion.

Stock cable is premium one, it is thick and multi core. The cable separator and terminations are made up of metal. Cable is modular and comes with Dunu Q lock system. It has 3.5 mm and 4.4 mm terminations which are swappable. Stock cable that came with this unit is 0.78 mm 2 pin type. Dunu offers mmcx and 2 pin type both in cable and iem.

Sheer number of ear tips included makes it very easy to settle on most comfortable ear tip. You can see the number and variety of ear tips just go few lines up. These are premium ear tips.

Iem booties are great inclusion. There is cleaning cloth & tool also included. Provided case is leather or faux leather can’t comment. But the case is sturdy and hard. It will be useful to protect iems.

Comfort & Fit:

Shells being made up of metal don’t weight too much you can call them light. There is no soreness or discomfort felt during my extended listening. Shells are medium sized, yet I will ask people to do

demo before purchase.

Cable is not microphonic so no disturbance while listening to music. Ear hooks on the cable don’t tug on the iems.

Passive noise isolation is there. You can easily block outside noises up to 60% loud noises will still get in. As the shells have open back design, I don’t know how its providing good isolation. But isolation works.

Overall Comfort & Fit 5/5

&#x200B;

Configuration:

2 DD + 6BA combination hybrid Iem. One 10mm DD + One 8mm DD, Unknown Knowles BAs. Advanced 4-way crossover with both physical and electronic one. Impedance, sensitivity & frequency range are unknown.

Music Genre Used for this Review:

Hip hop/EDM/Rap/Rock both classic and hard/Bollywood Music/Pop/Jazz/Regional music etc.

https://music.apple.com/in/playlist/test-tracks/pl.u-8aAVXG6ivz8gyxX?ls

Sources:

Sources from basic ones to hi end ones.

1.Jcally jm6 type 4.4

2.Moondrop pro

3.Fiio KA3

4.Fiio KA13

5.EPZ TP50

6.Onix alpha xi 1

7.Cayin RU6

8.Cayin RU7

9.Tempotec V3 Blaze

This iem is very efficient as when i used jcally jm6 type 4.4 as source it was able to drive this iem with ease. As I scaled with sources mentioned above it was able to scale along. So iem is scaling well with powerful sources. Best pairing was achieved with Cayin RU7, onix alpha xi 1 & Tempotec V3 blaze.

Sources scaling Tempotec v3 blaze > Cayin RU7 > Onix Alpha xi 1 > Cayin Ru6 > EPZ TP50 > Fiio KA13 > Moondrop Dawn pro > Fiio KA3> Jcally jm6

So, I preferred mostly neutral and dark sources with them. I didn’t like presentation with bright sources.

&#x200B;

Ear tips:

I used variety of ear tips to test the iems from small bore to wide bore and exotic ear tips

best pairing that I found was with Dunu S & S ear tips for me.

Sound Impressions:

Bass / Lows:

Sub bass here is fast and quick type. It rumbles but not to point where you can feel it. You can hear it. Sub bass is less compared to mid bass. Mid bass here is good quality type. You can feel it. It is also quick and fast decay kind. Here the tuning is mid bass over sub bass. Bass is not for bass head lovers. This is neutral and treble head level bass.

Drums kick drums sound bit anemic as the reverberations are missing. Bass guitars the string reverberations are also not up to the point.

I personally think this is the weakest point of this set.

Overall Bass/Lows 3.5/5

Mids:

Mids are forward here. Vocals sound front centre. You can heart singer taking gulps of air. Male vocals are good but Female vocals shine here. Sibilance is present. “ch“ “t” “s” sound pronounced.

Instruments in Mids sound clear. String instruments sound good. There is clarity in instruments due to tuning choice.

Overall Mids 5/5

Treble / Highs:

Treble here is tuned well. There are enough macro & micro details. You will not miss any details.

Soundstage is wide and has average height. Yet this is not the widest set I have had pleasure to review. Layering and separation is good. There is no congestion or smearing. Positional queue are correct and on point. Holographic stage.

Treble here can become bit too much for people who are sensitive to treble.

Overall Treble/Highs 5/5

Song Impressions:

Ae Dil Hai Mushkil

This song is to check for vocals, layering & separation. Starting piano piece sounds great. Drum sticks and strike on their surface feel dull. Both Male & female vocals are great. String instruments are emphatic. Trumpets sound great. No smearing. All instruments are well separate.

Overall good quality reproduction.

Angel by Massive Attack.

Bass check song for me. Here the entire song has subbass droning which you can hear and feel at the same time. This is lacking here. Vocals are good. Sub bass and mid bass are soul of this song, and they are anaemic here. So entire song feels bit let down.

Ego Death by Polyphia

This song is check for soundstage, layering, speed of drivers & separation. Here the lack of bass impact affects drums and guitar notes. They fell bit dull. Instruments are well separated and don’t smear each other. Song doesn’t get harsh or shrill. Which it can depending on tuning.

Overall acceptable reproduction.

Hotel California by Eagles

This is iconic song every audiophile knows. So using this song to check overall representation of it. Guitars which are usp of this song are well represented. Drums are not up to the mark. You can make out all the twinkies & sparkles in the song. Vocals are as they should be. Reproduction is good in terms of guitars, but the bass impact is missing. That makes this song more enjoyable. No harshness or shrillness was encountered.

Overall adequate reproduction.

Final Conclusion:

Dunu knows how to make great sets. Look at single DD sets they are all legends in their respective price brackets. Yet when it comes to hybrids. They have been bit hit & miss. SA6 was massive hit & remains as legend. So, I had high regard that this set might be next best hybrid from Dunu.

Here in Vulkan2 it has the technical prowess that Dunu is well known for. Vocals are excellent. Soundstage feel wide and tall. Yet all this is negated by lack of bass impact in the tuning. It makes the tuning incomplete for me. I feel if Dunu had provided bass like their DD sets, this would have been one of the best releases from them in hybrid sets.

Don’t get me wrong it’s not negating anything done right here by Dunu. If you are detail chaser and stage hound this set will please you. For Mid Fi set this has lot of things right. Just Bass heads this is not for you.

Thank you for enduring with me till end. Now go grab cup of hot coffee and kick your legs up, start jamming to music you love. See you soon in another review.

1p62k07,https://www.reddit.com/r/espresso/comments/1p62k07/help_me_choose_ecm_mechanika_heritage_vs_bezzera/,Help Me Choose! [ECM Mechanika Heritage vs Bezzera Luce PID],"Hello everyone - I hope I'm in the right place as I do not post often.

I presently have an Ultima Cosa Espresso Machine and for the money, it's just fine, but I'm looking to move on to bigger and better things.  No one machine is ""best"" for everyone, but I am hoping someone can help me make an informed decision between two contenders: The ECM Heritage Mechanika VI Slim and the Bezzera Luce PID.

A little about what I like to drink:  I enjoy mostly milk-based drinks. Flat Whites, Lattes etc.  I have no problem with straight espresso too, but that's only about 5% of what I drink.

I have 1 drink per day. Rarely 2.  Probably 6-8 a week. I enjoy medium or lighter roasts and I tend to extract a little on the quick side to get a bit more sour notes in the mix (36ml in 25 seconds is the target shot time presently, measured from the start of the machine's pre-infusion). I tend to drink the same beans 95% of the time regardless if I'm making a flat white (my favourite) or something else

I don't have the option to plumb in or connect a drain, but I also don't necessarily need a massive water storage since I'm not making many in a given day. My wife enjoys taking some hot water in the morning to use with her tea, but does not drink coffee at all.

I don't think I need to produce enough drinks in a row to justify any double-boiler models hence the thought to pursue an HX design which also saves quite a lot of cost.

I like the look of the Heritage a bit more than the Luce, but the Luce has levers, which I think I'd enjoy more. The Luce isn't bad looking either, just the lesser of the two for me. Both are gorgeous, in my opinion, but slight edge to the Heritage.

The Heritage has preinfusion built in, whereas the Luce I'd have to do it manually with a half-raise of the lever.

The Luce has a true PID, whereas the Heritage has 3 preset PID positions on a switch. The Heritage seems to have an SS boiler, whereas the Luce uses copper. Both have a screw adjustment for boiler pressure, which is a nice feature (this is what ultimately took the Profitec Pro 500 out of the running for me, that and the multiple reports of failing SSRs due to bad placement in the case).

There are other differences too, of course.

Price point is almost exactly the same between the two models.

I should note that I have already selected my grinder and I chose the  DF64 Gen 2.5 with Red Titanium Flat Burrs.

I'll be interested in good quality feedback that anyone can provide to help me decide. Or maybe I've left out some important details in which case please ask and I'll answer.",1,1764042962.0,espresso,0,1.0,False

I can tell that this is sterling (lion passant), Victorian (her profile), assayed at London (leopard's head), and made by Henry Wilkinson & Co., which was based in Sheffield and also had its mark registered in London.

And for the entire 10 years, his mother has made my life absolutely miserable.

It started literally the moment we got together. She used to talk shit about me to our nieces, who were six and two at the time. Then she spent years trying to pit me and my husband’s ex–sister-in-law against each other by making up lies about things we supposedly “said” or “did” to cause drama.

Years ago, there was a huge blowup where my husband and his mom were screaming in each other’s faces because she kicked his dad out and got mad that we brought him coffee. She accused my husband of “choosing his father over her.” When I stepped in between them to stop it from escalating, she blamed the entire fight on me.

Now to the present: His mother has custody of our two nieces (his sister’s daughters). The oldest (16) lives with my husband and me full-time, but my MIL still refuses to let us schedule her doctor or dentist appointments because “everything must go through her.” She wants to maintain control, even though she’s not the one actually raising her day-to-day.

Here’s what makes it worse:
She still collects SNAP benefits and cash assistance for the niece who lives with us, and we see none of it.
We fully support her. Food, clothes, transportation, school needs, hygiene products, everything, but MIL keeps all of the benefits that are supposed to be for her.

My husband and I also pay for both girls’ phones. Recently we grounded the 16-year-old for using her phone inappropriately and lying to us. We didn’t fully take it away, we put parental controls on it so she could only call/text immediate family, including his mother.

But MIL blew up our phones demanding to know why she “couldn’t talk to her.” I explained calmly that actions have consequences and we’re trying to teach her responsibility. She still blamed me, calling me the bitch who was “keeping them apart” because she wanted to message her on Facebook, not just text or call.

Then when our other niece and their cousin stayed over, MIL told them they weren’t allowed to use their phones at our house because “it wasn’t fair” to the grounded niece. Like… make it make sense.

There’s honestly so much more that I could write, but it would take a whole book. She gets mad when I pick up her slack providing for the girls (she’s on SSI, so money is tight), she constantly stirs drama, and she blames me for every single thing she doesn’t like. It has been like this for a decade.

I finally asked my husband if we could cut his mother off completely. Not the nieces, we would never abandon them. Just his mother.

But now I’m second-guessing myself.

Pepperoni Pizza - Ok, but the sauce is too tangy.

Chicken bacon Pizza - Bland as the dessert. QT's choice of bacon topping is disgusting. It's thick-cut, chewy bacon. It would be so much better if it was thin and crunchy. 

Breakfast pizza - Good when you don't get a pile of the chewy bacon on it. I feel they stop making it too early, but there is probably sales data telling them when to stop making it. 

Jalapeno sausage rolls - Love these! Sometimes I get one with a hard chunk of something in it like a bone fragment. Not really sure what it is but hard enough to crack a tooth if not careful. 

Coffee cups - Garbage. A good many of them end up leaking. Lids don't have close tabs, so if you place a full cup in your cars cup holder, coffee will splash up out of the lid if you hit bumps.

Coffee machines &  prep area - Machines are slow but whatever...Creamer selection is fine but the creamer containers are often sticky cause the creamer lids are loose and leak.down the side of the container.. Put a.tiny sink next to the creamer cooler so people can rinse their hands. Price of coffee is kinda high and approaching DD pricing. 

Premade subs with tomatoes - Someone tries really really hard to make it look like there are tomatoes on the sub but opening the sandwich reveals barely more than the tiniest of slivers. Made to order subs don't have this problem.

Ta Quitos are bland and all taste the same too me. Chicken rollers I like. Both are a little steep price wise for what they are. Hot dogs, jalapeno sausage dogs are all good. Sometimes the buns are hard which is strange as they're sitting in steam drawers. 

Made to order kitchen food - Subs, wraps, soft serve ice cream and sandwiches have all been good. No complaints. 

No food related rant: Gas pumps out of receipt paper frequently. When I'm gassing up vehicles for work and have to enter driver number and mileage, it would be helpful to let me input mileage first (like it used to!) as I'm having to flash memorize that. Annoying to input driver number and forget what the mileage was and have to go back.and look again.

✦

Star decides this is going to be easy.

“Low-key,” she tells the glue gun, the banner, the fog machine, the universe. She writes LOW-KEY on a sticky note and underlines it five times like underlines can domesticate her. She tapes it to the cork board beside a doodle of a bat, then, because habits have elbows, plugs in the fog machine anyway.

Texting muscle memory kicks in.

STAR 🌟: send costume pic?? pleeeease 👀✨
The bubble appears, vanishes, reappears. Then:
JANNA 🐍: no
“Rude,” she informs the kitchen, which glitters in sympathy. She tries again.
STAR 🌟: ok FINE don’t send. swing by for 2 mins so i can see it irl
JANNA 🐍: suspicious
STAR🌟: also can u grab cake mix? emergency
JANNA 🐍: manipulative. what flavor
STAR 🌟: spooky vanilla
JANNA 🐍: that’s just vanilla
STAR 🌟: spookier vanilla
JANNA 🐍: i hate you in a fond way. be there later

Star fist-pumps. The sticky note curls like it knows what show it’s on.

Downstairs, the Diaz place tunes itself like an orchestra. Marco wrestles a “Totally Not a Party” banner that keeps swan-diving into his face. Jackie swaps a harsh bulb for the gentlest amber in existence. Chloe slides a speaker two inches and the house exhales. Kelly drops a single plastic eyeball into the punch bowl with ceremonial reverence. Pony Head FaceTimes in to promise a tasteful playlist (she lies).

Guests trickle in: Buff Frog and Katrina; Ludo and Dennis; Kelly, Jackie, Chloe; Higgs; Starfan 13; Oskar; Alphonso and Ferguson; Sensei Brantley—until the living room is a Halloween diorama with feelings. Star, fully Usagi, vibrates like a lit fuse. Marco, accidentally Kazuma, tries to staple the banner into submission. Jackie, very much Aqua, walks in and freezes.

“We did not plan this,” she says to Marco’s matching cloak.

“We absolutely did not,” he says, blushing anyway.

“Ground rule,” Jackie adds, stringing fairy lights. “No jump scares. Enrichment for the habitat.”

“Two hours. Tiny island of calm,” Marco says.

“Two hours,” Star nods. “Maybe three!”

The fog machine coughs. Somewhere a playlist pretends to be tasteful for four whole bars.

✦

Janna ignores the first call.

She’s in her room with Holly loafed on the windowsill, a bowl of chips in her lap, and the dashboard of Gremlin Field Notes open on an old laptop. She types: “Echo Creek cemetery: why are there always two crows at 3:07 a.m. who’s paying them” and attaches a blurry photo of exactly two crows at exactly 3:07 a.m. She hits post, chews, pretends the phone isn’t buzzing.

It buzzes again. Star.

She lets it ring out of spite and because the music bleeding through the speaker is already too loud.

It buzzes a third time. She answers.

“What?”

“Banana! Hi! Happy birthday!!!” The music on Star’s end drops one notch. “I miss your face. Can you swing by for, like, two minutes so I can see your costume? Two minutes! Promise!”

“What is that noise?”

“What noise?” Star says, which is a crime.

In the background, Pony Head cackles, “GIRL—” and a fog machine dies theatrically.

Janna sighs. “Your house sounds possessed.”

“Okay, but, like, friendly possessed?” Star huffs her inhaler off-mic. “Please? Quick drive-by? I promise minimal… everything.”

Janna looks at Holly. Holly slow-blinks. Janna looks at the door. “Fine. Two.”

“Yesss!”

Click. Peace returns.

It lasts seven seconds. The phone lights again. Tom.
She stares at his name, debates, answers.

“Hey, little witch,” he says, and even through a phone the line lands right; literal costume, archetype, endearment. “We still on for ramen later? After your graveyard cake ritual?”

“Maybe,” she says, neutral. “Depends how haunted I feel.”

“I’ll be the very normal human wearing a sticker that says so.”

“Bold bit.”

He laughs. “Marco keeps calling me. I think I’m late for something I didn’t agree to.”

“Run,” she says, smiling where he can’t hear it.

When she passes the kitchen, Tala looks up from a stack of bills like a smoke alarm. “Where are you going, Janna Rose?”

“Out,” she says, already reaching for her coat.
“Work in the morning. Be responsible.”

“Noted.”

Marino peeks from the oven, face warm with sugar heat. “Maligayang kaarawan, anak,” he says, and slides a small plate to the counter. “Saved you a slice.”

Janna’s mouth softens. “Thanks, Pa.”

She grabs keys. Puffy mints. Hat. Out.

✦

She parks a block away and sits in the quiet seat of her Subaru. The porch at the Diaz house hums. Bass tickles the air in the way that makes her teeth argue with her skull. She curls her fingers; the little bent “dino-hand” stim that keeps them from shaking, and mutters at the empty car, “Two minutes.”

Her phone, upside down in the cup holder, lights once more with Star’s name, then goes dark. “Two minutes,” she repeats, and steps out.

✦

The front door lies with glitter: TOTALLY NOT A PARTY.

Janna nudges it in with a shoulder. The house inhales like a choir.

“Surprise!” the room says, loudly and in stereo.
She buffers. Hat brim shadows hair; eyeliner sharp enough to file keys on; Sucy silhouette that fits her too well. The fluorite pendant taps once at her sternum and remembers its job. Under it, the little mechanical tick remembers, too.

“You realize I’m the one person who hates surprises,” she says to the general area, voice flat as a spirit level.

Star is on her in three steps, all Usagi bows and weaponized optimism. “Banana! Twenty-one! I just want to see your costume and also your face and give you cake!”

“I was going to eat cake in my car at the graveyard,” Janna says. “That plan still slaps.”

“It’s low-key!” Star says, which offends every law of physics in the room.

“Enrichment for the habitat,” Kelly calls from the table, dropping a single fake eyeball into punch. Chloe slides a decibel meter across the counter like a votive. Jackie drifts by with fairy lights and turns the house’s heart rate down by ten.

Tom slips in, a bakery box in his hands, HELLO I AM HUMAN sticker on his jacket. His eyes catch on Janna’s hat and brighten like he solved a puzzle. 

“Filipina witch solidarity.”

“Obviously,” she says.

Across the kitchen, Marco, half-Kazuma, battles frosting. When he looks up and sees her, the old warmth flicks on like a light he forgot he left. She sidles closer, because she’s an idiot.

“Nice cologne,” she says, deadpan, and then, before she can stop herself, leans in. “It’s nice. Foreplay vibes.”

He startles. Blushes. Looks good while blushing. It hits her in the stupidest place.

Footsteps. Star.

“Ugh—Janna!” Marco sputters, masking last second like a pro. He laughs it off and it lands warmer than it used to. She’s the only one who notices.

She pretends not to. She flips a pocket flashlight and clicks the beam across her own pupils, watching them dilate. “Science,” she tells no one, and switches it off.

The bass pushes its luck. The fog machine coughs up a ghost and calls it Ambience. The edges of the room get teeth. Jackie materializes with a soda already cold. “Small sips,” she says, kind without comment.

“You’re illegally calming,” Janna mutters, taking it. Which means thanks.

She lasts two more minutes. Star and Marco bump shoulders; domestic gravity, not fireworks. The knot under Janna’s collarbone tightens. She slides into the dim hallway like a shadow trying to be polite.

“Hey,” Marco says, not too close.

“Certified fine,” she says, hand on the doorknob like a railing.

“That doesn’t sound fine.”

“It’s the deluxe model.” She gets the door open. “Go save your princess, Diaz.”

He believes her. It’s the smartest thing he does all night.

Outside air is a cool cloth. The porch light hums a tired halo. Fog kneads the steps like a cat. She sits and lets her posture finally sag. The house keeps trying to be smaller for love’s sake. The street is already the size she needs.

The screen door eases. A careful voice stands in the doorway.

“Mind if I…?”

“You always ask,” she says. Taps the step beside her. “Come here.”

✦

Tom doesn’t plop. He enters the circle of light like it has rules.

“Graveyard and cake. That your birthday tradition?” 

he asks, sitting one step lower, shoulders soft.
“Forks are a hate crime,” she says, eating with her fingers and swiping icing off her cheekbone with the back of her hand.

He laughs into his sleeve. Vanilla, damp wood, the far-off throb of a party learning manners; the porch builds a small planet and lets them orbit it.

“I, uh… got you something,” he says, setting a small rune-stamped box on the step between them. “It doesn’t explode. I checked twice.”

She eyes it like it might sprout fangs. Flicks the lid.
Inside: a silver ring with a thin black inset track. Not-letters etched into the band in a language you only understand when you stop trying to read it.

“You got me jewelry,” she deadpans. Her pulse takes one surprised half-step. “Bold, for a raccoon.”

“It’s a fidget,” he says quickly. “You like having something to do with your hands.”

“Did you… notice that.”

“Hard not to.” He counts them off, gentle. “You drum on cups. Tap doorframes to check for hollow spots. 

Roll coins when you think no one’s watching.” He curls his fingers, mirrors her little bracing claw without making it a bit. “Thought maybe a spinny thing would help.”

Her eyes light like someone turned her on at the wall. She slides it onto her pinky; it fits like the metal has known her hand longer than she has. She nudges the black band with her thumb.

Whirr.

A quiet thread of sound. Not quite noise. More like permission. The porch throb drops a notch. Her shoulders drop a centimeter. She does it again.
Whirr.

“Okay,” she says, and in Janna that’s a small holy word. She can’t stop. “Okay, this is—illegal.” Their smiles are reflexes they don’t bother to hide. 

She leans on the railing, ring spinning. “Thanks.”

He watches her like she’s a weather pattern that makes sense. “You look beautiful,” he says, which is not a trick and not a performance.

She tips him a look over her shoulder. “Are you flirting with me, demon boy?”

“Maybe.”

The screen door cracks. Marco’s silhouette appears framed in kitchen gold, holding a knife deputized for cake. He finds them, registers the ring glint, the air, the way Tom is looking at her like she’s a star that doesn’t know it. Star calls his name from the aquarium. He vanishes.

On the porch, the world stays small.

Tom clears his throat. Softens. “Ya know… I like you, Janna.”

“Oh?”

“Yes. I like-like you. I always said I wanted to be with someone I could be best friends with. And you fit that description.”

Her breath catches in the simplest way. The ring slows under her thumb, then obeys again. “You’re not supposed to say that out loud.”

“Why not?”

“Because then it’s real.”

“Was real before I said it,” he says. He leaves the last inch of air. “If I…”

She nods once. Then again, smaller, confirming to herself that the first nod wasn’t an accident. “Yeah.”
He leans in at a speed doubt could outrun. She tilts to meet him. Noses bump. Teeth click. She makes a startled sound that almost laughs. He eases back a fraction.

“Sorry,” he murmurs. “Let me… here.”

His palm rises and cradles her jaw like a fragile drawer. His thumb finds the tiny dent in her chin. He doesn’t snort. He treats it like a fact. He tries again, slower. Guides. Never takes. She follows like it’s an experiment. Then like it’s a song.

The ring settles from whirr to hush. Vanilla, damp wood, the faint citrus of his stupid fancy soap. The porch light ticks in its socket. Inside, a cheer rises for cake and arrives out here softened by distance.

“Okay?” he breathes.

She nods against his mouth. The nod turns into a sound she refuses to be embarrassed about later. His other hand stays on the railing, keeping the world bracketed and safe. He kisses her again, tide-slow; forward, rest, the softest retreat, return, giving her space to choose every inch. She chooses. Her free hand fists in his sleeve. The ring anchors her other thumb because the ring tells her where the edges are.

He ghosts down to her jaw, barely there. Her breath tangles. He pauses each time her breath changes. She decides, and only then does he move. His mouth hovers near the top of her sternum; not the center, not the scar. Close enough for breath to remember fluorescent ceilings and antiseptic and months of counting tiles to avoid thinking.

He doesn’t touch the scar. He knows better.
Her body betrays her anyway.

The tick kicks. The porch hum sharpens into a buzzing fluorescent. Memory elbows the present with gloved hands. Metal taste. Paper gown. Voices that chart instead of love.

“Stop,” she says, hoarse. The flare she promised herself she’d throw.

He’s already still. Palms open. Face uninjured. He backs off two inches like it was always the plan.

“I can’t,” she gets out, clutching her chest. “I’m trying— I can’t.”

“Okay,” he says, and sets the word down between them like a blanket. “Okay, we stop.”

She collects her edges; hat brim low, coat tight, hands doing the confused-bird routine. She reels them in and makes her mouth find a joke.

“Certified hexed,” she says, shaky. “Checks out.”

He nods. Doesn’t reach. Doesn’t apologize. Two kinds of care.

She stands too fast. The step creaks its opinion. One look back; wrecked, fond, guilty for a crime that isn’t one; and she’s off the porch. The fog swallows sound. Three strides and she’s out of the light’s gravity.

Tom stays exactly where he is so she’ll know the silhouette will be the same if she comes back.

✦

The screen door sighs. Marco steps out with two sodas, frosting gospel drying on his sleeve. He reads the negative space and something gentles behind his eyes.

“You got Janna’d,” he says.

Tom’s laugh hurts. “Yeah. Guess I did.” He scrubs a hand over his face. “I feel like I did something wrong, man. Did I mess up? We kissed, and I got carried away and we— and then she— ugh. I messed up, didn’t I?”

“Chill, Tom. You didn’t do anything wrong,” Marco says, steady. He sets a soda between them like a treaty. “You stopped. That’s the part that matters. Rule one with Janna? Don’t chase. Rule two? Sugar, then space.”

“I don’t want her to think I’m mad. Or that she broke something.”

“She’ll think both anyway.” Marco’s voice softens. 

“Text her later. One sentence. No question marks. Then wait.”

Tom blows out a breath. “I like her, man. A lot.”

Marco nods. “Yeah? It’s Janna. She’s weird like that… you try and get close and then she’s pickpocketing your wallet or running off into the night after kissing.”

“Yeah… I’ll just give her space. I don’t mean to scare her.”

“I know. Give her a bit. She’ll come around, dude.”

The door cracks. Star leans in, Usagi bows wilted, glitter smudged soft on her cheek. “Is she… mad at me? I said low-key. I—” She swallows. “I forget sometimes.”

“She’s not mad,” Marco says. “She’s overwhelmed.”

“I threw a party at her,” Star winces. “I’ll sparkle-evacuate the extras.”

“I got it,” Jackie says, inevitable as tide. Mermaid-elegant, practical, bouncer-kind. “Okay, my beautiful monsters,” she calls inside, smiling. “Thanks for coming, drive safe, take a cupcake for the road. No loitering. I love you. Out.”

What follows is a storm deciding to leave. Chloe sweeps decibels. Kelly croaks “ribbit later,” rescues her lone punch-eyeball. Pony Head kisses the air and promises a playlist titled Tasteful (it isn’t). Oskar vows to finish a song someday. Alphonso and Ferguson argue exit strategies. Door clicks happen at kind volumes. Hugs happen at permission distances. The room un-parties itself like a tide returning shells it borrowed.

They reconvene on the steps—Star between Marco and Tom, a small vibrating promise trying to purr. 

Jackie dims the porch light a notch and ghosts away.
“Tomorrow we do something quiet,” Star says. “No surprises. Just coffee and dumb cartoons. If she wants.”

Tom nods. “One text. No question marks.”

“Once,” Marco says, clinking soda to seal it.

✦

The ring glints once under a streetlamp and then decides to be dull.

Janna walks fast because fast keeps thoughts from lapping her. Witch hat brim cuts the world to a private stage. She stops beneath a maple the color of warning signs and leans her spine into bark. Texture helps. She rubs her neck where the warmth lingers. She won’t look at the pendant. Not yet.

Her phone is a small bright weight. She opens it anyway.

JANNA 🐍: i’m fine. don’t make it weird.

Send.

Back on the porch, Tom’s screen lights his hands. He types. Deletes. Types smaller.

Tom🔥:  too late

Send.

Janna’s laugh escapes—soft, pained, grateful. She types three explanations and kills them all. Sends the only true bit.

JANNA 🐍:i like the ring

Send. Pocket. Walk.

She lets herself into the Ordonia house with practiced quiet. Tala’s car a shadow. Marino’s truck a darker one. The TV glows blue in an empty room. In the kitchen, the plate with her name on it waits. She takes the cake, climbs the stairs, and closes her door on the house’s opinions.

Holly chirps and kneads her thigh. “I know,” Janna tells the cat. She sets the cake on her desk, flops, stares at the ceiling until her hands turn back into hands. She rubs the spot at the base of her throat where the heat still blooms. “Coward,” she mutters at herself. She doesn’t mean it. Not tonight.

Her phone lights with a tag. Star’s story: crowded living room, frosting comet on Star’s wrist, a blur of Tom at the edge, and, in the background, Janna’s hat, Janna’s mouth, the faintest shadow blooming where his careful mouth got too close to old hurt. She hadn’t noticed in the porch light.

She exhales. Turns the phone face-down. Spins the ring.

Whirr. Whirr. Click.

Holly purrs like a small generator. The house creaks its familiar map. Janna stares at her hands until they are her hands.

✦

The lab keeps mercy-quiet. Fluorescents breathe. A paper cup of coffee has accepted its fate.
Monitors wash the room teal. Along the bottom of one screen: ORPHEUS // Telemetry Stream — Unit-02. The timestamp skates across 10-31 22:32:17. The line stops pretending to be a sleepy river. It spikes—clean, surgical, doubling on itself for two heartbeats, two rhythms trying to share one corridor—then flutters, steadies.

Ari rolls close, stylus tapping. “There. Third anomaly this month.”

Dr. Seraphina Reyes watches without surprise. Hair clipped flat against ambition. Lab coat buttoned like a closing argument. “Strip the garbage.”

Ari peels away fireworks, traffic, municipal Wi-Fi, Pony Head’s tasteful playlist bleeding into the night. Noise drops. The spike remains, sharper for the honesty. Ari overlays HRV bands. Color blooms.

“Lead-in looks like co-regulation,” they narrate. “Then sympathetic surge. Someone got close. Then she panicked.”

“Or the machine protected the host,” Reyes says, hand on 
the back of the data to keep it from running off a cliff.
On the graph, the braid of double-pulse twines, touches, separates. Ari zooms until pixels show their seams. “Same braid as the July park incident. Same as the bus shelter in September.”

“And the same abort.” Reyes turns to a side console, pulls an old tray from a cold archive. Labels in her square hand: ORDONIA, J. — POST-C— SAMPLES — YR 0. Vials clink faintly. Notes rustle—the six-year-old file from a night when a girl didn’t die and the world changed jobs. “Backtrace the geohash. Quarter-kilometer radius.”

A map blossoms—Echo & Vine glowing soft. A block from the Diaz house. A lifetime from the graveyard fence.

“Halloween,” Ari says, because the calendar has theater.

“Myth is a good camouflage for science,” Reyes says. She sets the old notes beside the new screen. Two versions of the same heartbeat stare each other down. “Passive polling to ten-second intervals for twenty-four hours. No active ping.”

“Because she spooks easy,” Ari says.

Reyes doesn’t confirm. She doesn’t need to. The teal line settles into its neat, stubborn cadence. For a moment the room seems to hear a porch light humming from very far away. For a moment the green almost matches it.

“Log as Unit-02, Event Ten-Thirty-One underscore Twenty-Two-Thirty-Two,” Reyes says. “Tag it Entrainment Attempt / Abort.”

Ari stamps the verdict in the corner. The room remembers the temperature of old coffee.
“Do you think she knows we can see this?” Ari asks, because someone should ask.

“She knows someone is watching,” 

Reyes says, clinical and not unkind. She rests her palm on the six-year-old folder like a woman measuring a door. “She doesn’t know who. Yet.”
The teal keeps breathing. The vials don’t answer. Somewhere across the city, a girl in a witch hat spins a ring—whirr, whirr, click—until her heartbeat signs a truce again, and for tonight, that is enough.

For the record I am 35(F) and the youngest of 3, my former friend is 36(F).

I had a friend I met in the 2nd grade. We didn’t click right away, in fact I mildly hated her for petty 7yo reasons; she had the audacity to come to class on Halloween in the same costume as me. Give me a break I was 7. At some point I got over my petty hatred over a costume, and we became friend and were best friend by the end of the year. We hung out all the time, during the summer breaks we’d go to the beach, movies, playground, have sleepovers or just play/hangout doing nothing; we were nearly inseparable.

Her dad got sick during or right before our senior year. I was there as much as I could be and a shoulder for her whenever she needed; she was my best friend so of course I was there for her. Between Thanksgiving and Christmas, my family learned that my 33 year old cousin, who was more like another older sister than a cousin, was diagnosed with stage 3 melanoma. I kept this to myself for the most part, only mentioning to my best friend that my cousin was sick and going through treatment; she had enough to deal with I wasn’t going to lay my stuff on her too. 

Stage 3 quickly turned into stage 4 and the day before our Senior prom, my dad got a call that my cousin was being moved into hospice care. My family jumped in the car and went to the hospital. I could not bring myself to go and see her laying in a hospital bed, a decision I still feel guilty for making. My mom has told me I shouldn’t because my cousin wouldn’t want me to have that memory of her in the end, she’d want my last memories of her to be happy and her health and laughing and smiling, which they are. I kept this to myself also as my best friends dad seemed to be taking a turn. There was no way I was going to burden my friend when her dad was sick.

I went to prom with my best friend and we had fun, it gave us both the chance to get out of our heads. When I got home, my parents had fallen asleep on the couch with just the TV on. My dad sat up and my stomach dropped. He had the look on his face I had seen 3 other times in 10 years. While I was at prom with my friends, celebrating the end of our high school career, my cousin passed away at 34.

The wake for my cousin was a few days later, I went to school, needing the distraction, and my brother picked me up at the end of the day to go to the evening wake service. I stayed home from school the next day, just completely drained and not wanting to be around people. Turns out that was the day my friend got a call in the middle of class, a class that was during my free period and I often found myself in, that her dad had passed. I didn’t learn until the following day when I texted her to see if she wanted to hang out after school and to check in because I didn’t see her in the morning. She called me and told me and I immediately felt like the worst person. I would have been in the room when she got that call and I would have been there for her, but I hadn’t gone to school.

Whatever grieving I was doing, was done. It didn’t matter, my best friend just lost her dad. I asked her what she needed, what I could do for her. Did she want me to come over, did she want me to leave now (there was no way I wouldn’t get the permission from my parents to leave school early for this, also try and stop me), did she want to come over my house, did she need to get away? She wanted to get out of the house and was waiting in my driveway when I got home.

Since then I have always been a support for her, she lost her aunt a little over a year after that and I took off work to be at the services with her and just be there for her. I’ve been someone she can come to for absolutely anything, we take trips together and try to do things together. She moved out of state not long after her aunt passed but I made sure to go visit a least twice a year, St. Patrick’s day being a day we usually ended up hanging out. We have spring trips to Washington DC for the cherry blossoms and we’ve been out to Vegas twice, we’ve done overnights to Atlantic City. A lot of the times I would cover our hotel stays because I knew she had more expenses since she was helping her mom and I didn’t want to miss out on doing things together. I didn’t mind and she would usually buy dinner or lunch while we were out. 

I would even try to get down as close to her birthday as I could, I had a black out period with work around her birthday so it was hard to get off sometimes, but I usually got down early in the month if I could get down for her actual birthday. I made sure to be there for her 21st, and we got together on her 30th. We have gotten together around/for my birthday exactly 0 times; planned to get together 2 times and both times she cancelled. Which sucked but 🤷🏻‍♀️ what are you going to do. I kind of don’t give a shit about my birthday, it’s around the holidays so I usually had to work. Holiday sales, I worked retail so… yeah.

Now onto this shit show of a fuck ass years: 2024-2025

My dad was diagnosed with leukemia early 2024. There was a solid plan, it was caught early and we were told it wasn’t a death sentence. There was a lot of adjusting to treatments and drives to the hospital, preparation for stem cell transplant, dealing with him in the hospital for weeks at a time. It was a tiring year, but we were all pretty positive, my dad especially.

In March of this year (2025) we did our typical St. Patrick’s Day meetup. There was a concert in DC, one of the openers I know she loves and we’ve seen them together twice. I took 3 days off of work. The plan was day 1: drive down and concert, day 2: hang out and do something in the area and drive home at whatever hour because on day 3, which she was also off, I could just chill and sleep and not have to worry about work. I was looking forward to spending time with my best friend after the year me and my family had, my dad had gotten his stem cell at the beginning of the year (2025) and at the time of our DC trip he was doing well, numbers good and doctors happy. We had a good time at the concert, got something to eat after, and headed back to the hotel. Everything was fine and normal, we talked and watched a movie. Next day, we got up a little late and went for breakfast and coffee after checking out. At nearly 12 and I ask her “okay so what to we want to do? We can hit up some museums or go to the arboretum, we’ve never been there. Could be cool. We have the time, I don’t have to worry about work tomorrow so I can hang out until whenever”. She said that she’s going to head home, gave no reason or anything, not that she was tired or she’s not feeling well. I let it go because okay, that’s fine. I mean I took an extra PTO day so we could hang out and make the most out our days off. She had a 2ish hour drive, I had about 5 hours. I drove home kind of bummed and feeling a little like I got blown off.

The following week there were several hours of panic when no one could get a hold on my her and she’d deleted all of her social media account with no notice, even her GoodReads account. It was very uncommon to get no response from her for so long. I’d sent her something the night before and typically if it was a little late when I sent something, she’d answer in some way the next morning when she was getting ready for work. Our mutual friend and her usually talked on their way to work because they were driving around the same time. We got finally got a hold of her after about 4 hours, a friend actually call her work. She apologized for worrying everyone and she was just over social media. 

I had been ready to leave work early and drive down to check on her. She’d mentions in past months being in a “weird headspace” but unable to really explain more than that. Our friends and I made sure to keep in contact with her and stay connected, planning game nights with our Switch’s and FaceTiming. Between that and the social media blackout I was thinking the worst. Part of me doesn’t think she really understands the panic I felt. Conversation from her side started to dwindle, answers only a couple words and just having me feeling like she wasn’t interested in engaging. But I kept reaching out. 

April we learned that the stem cell transplant wasn’t doing everything the doctors hoped it would do for my dad, by May we had full confirmation that it essentially didn’t work and the cancer cells were back and he would have to try again with a new donor. May was also when we had to put my 14 year old golden retriever down, a great run for a golden but heart breaking and devastating nonetheless.

After that and processing the idea of my dad going through the stem cell transplant again really just had me at a point where I couldn’t take on anyone else’s stuff other than my own.

I’d had over a year where I had this very real hope that everything was going to be completely okay with my dad. When I would be asked how I was doing, usually only by the 2 friends not the best friend (she’d ask after promoted by the other 2 typically), I would tell them I was okay and I meant it. Everything was really positive and the teams working with my dad were great, he was at the best hospital in the area. There was no reason to worry, and my dad was calm throughout the whole thing which kept me from worrying. After learning my dad had to go through everything with a new donor again, I was less okay. 

I didn’t have the emotional capacity to be that same support to my best friend that I was in the past, I was tired and drained and scared. My dad was the one who was really my best friend, there wasn’t a thing I couldn’t talk to him about. We spent a lot of time together, he’d go with me to different spots to play photographer, we went to airshows together, he took me to the anniversary screening of the Lion King when no one else wanted to go, went with me to the Jersey retirement game for my favorite hockey player when no one was available, he was still helping me with my homework up until I was 29 and finally finishing my degree, though that particular assignment I had to show motion in a photo and he got to fly his plane so it wasn’t exactly a hardship. Then I got to be his first non-pilot passenger, i ended up being his only non-pilot passenger. 

June my dad got pneumonia, that was rooted in a mold infection in his lungs which was the real issue as it was an aggressive infection and harder to treat than others. I gave my friends the update in our group chat, he was in the hospital for a week, home the week after then back in for 3 weeks. The 2 friends acknowledged and checked in, the best friend did not. 2 days and I had not heard from her in either the group chat or her alone. Rather than continuing to be upset with the lack of response or acknowledgement I removed myself from the group, I worried I might lash out and that wasn’t productive. Her being my best friend, I did hold the expectation that I would hear something from her. I kind of feels like it’s the least anyone who you call a friend or calls you a friend could do.

September we were working out schedules to take my dad to the hospital as he wasn’t supposed to be driving himself yet while his was getting antibiotics via IV. I took Mondays and Fridays and my uncle took Wednesday’s, which he was very insistent on and it was kind of adorable. He was big brother helping little brother, it was great they got that time.

His oncologist wanted to make sure the one Monday appointment a family member was with him so she could check in and update. I went back with him and the doctor came in, telling us that it was time to start talking about hospice or hospice care at home. The infection was not where it needed to be for them to start any preparations for the stem cell transplant that they’d hoped to get going in August. His body was too weak to be able to handle the chemo needed and on that particular day he was have a hard time moving and getting up, he even needed a wheel chair to get up to the infusion floor. The cancer cells couldn’t be held in check, they wanted to admit him to the hospital and keep him until hospice was worked out because they worried about his mobility at home without the proper accommodations. This was devastating to learn, my experience with hospice was my cousin who entered one day and was gone the next. I sat with my dad for a while, hugged him and cried, hated that I was alone finding this out and I had to tell my sister and brother and my mom.

They brought him out for his antibiotic infusion and I made an attempt at working, calling my sister first because I was absolutely not going to be the only one sitting with this. I text my brother to call me when he could and spoke to him next. I told my mom when I got home, my nephews school was doing snacks with grandparents and she was going and I didn’t want to take away from that. When I got home, she was expecting my dad to be with me. I brought in the groceries and told her what the doctor said about hospice. She was shocked, we had all thought that it was going to be news about progress, maybe getting told that they were ready to get a donor and set everything up for the stem cell.

I update my 2 friends, one passing the info to the best friend because I didn’t want her blindsided if the worst happened but I wasn’t in the head space to talk to her. My dad was in the hospital that whole week. Very early Saturday morning his blood pressure dropped and he was rushed down to CCU. We got a call around 5am that we should get to the hospital. My mom called my brother who lives out of state and told him he needed to get get here as soon as he could and I booked him a one way flight up that was coming in later that evening.

The news was as bad as we could expect, the meds they had him on could only be given on the CCU floor and they were the only thing keeping his heart going. The doctor was impressed that my dad was awake and alert, no confusion and completely lucid. He said most patients in that state usually aren’t even conscious. But my dad spent the last year and a half being stubborn and defying odds. He understood where we were at but he was holding on. I reached out to my cousins and one was about to pick my brother up when his flight got in and throughout the day we had made calls and sat with my dad, just talking. 

I texted my one friend and she was there within and hour with her school work, I asked her and my other friend to pass the info to my “best friend” and her mother, knowing (or assuming I guess) they’d want to know even if I hadn’t spoken to her in 2 months. Friends of my dad came down and had the chance to talk to him, his brother was there with us and him the whole day, other cousins were able to come and see him and actually talk with him. My friend, who is newly married with a 13yo, stayed from like 11am until 9 or so. Sunday my other friend was there after being away the weekend. I gave him the out, he didn’t need to be there but he showed up and was there for hours. The whole time I hadn’t heard from the “best friend”.

I needed a break from the room, just sitting and literally waiting for my dad to die. I went to the bathroom, had my little meltdown in private and sat in the waiting area. My sister text me about 40 minutes later and said they last of the medication keeping my dads heart going had finished and his heart rate was lowering. I went back in, and sat next to her, my brother on her other side, uncle and aunt on the other side of the bed and my mom standing right next to my dad holding his hand.

Monday morning at 1:57am I watched the monitor tracking my dad’s heartbeat go to 0.

I have not heard a word from my “best friend” since my dad’s passing. No text, no call. No explanation. We’re over 2 months since he passed and nothing. Even if we were in a fight, which would be news to me, I cannot see a single reason for her to be MIA like this. And I tried. Maybe it was too much for her because of her own father. I thought maybe she got her own bad news and didn’t want to add anything on me, but that didn’t explain why she went dark with our other 2 friends. Maybe she was mad at me for not being in enough contact.

I have pushed aside my shit, my own grieving, to focus on what she was going through and to be there for her. She never asked me to put my own grieving on hold, and my resentment toward her for her absence throughout all of this does make me feel a little guilt. Because I shouldn’t resent her for choices I made, but I can’t change that it’s there. This was the absolute worst year of my life, and she couldn’t even hang out with me for a few extra hour the last time we saw each other. 

I’ve never been one to ask for help or explicitly say I need someone, I’ve been conditioned to just deal with my problems myself. I needed my best friend, she should know me well enough to know that. My other 2 friends do and I haven’t known them nearly as long.

I lost my dad, I literally watched his heart stop. She knows what it’s like to loose a dad you’re close with. I lost him and her in the same weekend. I don’t know how this could be forgiven, if it can we will never be the friends we were before. She’s always been on a little in the selfish side, a stereotypical only child but I was never really one to have to deal with it because I would call her on shit if it was necessary which wasn’t often and I haven’t done probably since high school.

Maybe I’m a fault, could have reached out more. Maybe I set the precedence with her where her needs and feelings were more important than mine, that her troubles mattered more. That’s on me. For the first time in 17 years, I put myself first, because I just could not deal with anything other than my own shit and I lost a friend I had for 28 years. And I don’t have a single clue why.

I was going to call her or text her, but I’m quick to jump to angry when emotions are running high. And like I mentioned earlier yelling wasn’t going to be productive. But I needed to have some kind of finality to the friendship because it was over, that much was clear. I wrote her a letter, 3.5 pages of me basically saying wtf and that I was done. I sent that about a month ago now, waiting to see if there would be some kind of contact, and still silence

I dont know that I’d answer a call from her or a text. She can honestly get fucked. Short of her having been in the hospital herself, I can no longer see a justifiable reason to not even get a “I’m so for your loss”. She knew my dad, he helped her and was there for her and her mom when her dad passed because our parents were friends. I mourned her dad’s death too, I spent a lot of time at her house growing. Did she not have any reaction to my dad dying? Does she care at all?

I’m angry, frustrated, sad. The loss of the friendship adds to the loss of my dad, and it makes it worse. She was supposed to be my best friend, these are the moments you need your best friend the most. It doesn’t matter that she’s 7 hours away. It’s going to fester in my mind until I have some kind of answer. There might come a time where I break and call her because it’ll eat away at me and I’ll want an explanation.

I want to mention that I have told my 2 friends to do whatever it is they want to in terms of her. We aren’t friend but I’m not expecting them to drop her. I told them I will not hold anything against them if they continue a friendship with her, I’m not looking for solidarity. This is my thing. But they both basically said fuck that.

Told you it’d be long.

TLDR: My best friend of nearly 30 years ghosted me while my dad was dying and after he passed. I was always there for her through everything, but when I needed her the most, she disappeared without a word. I lost my dad and my best friend in the same weekend, and I don’t know how to process either loss",1,1764041365.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,0.67,False

24. male and gay.

i am scared of online dating. the idea of meeting people through a screen makes me freeze with insecurity. it feels too easy to create unrealistic versions of people based on whatever they post, especially when i have never met them in person. my mind fills in the blanks with who i think they are. i understand why this happens, but i have never found a way to stop myself from doing it.

a couple of years ago i met a guy who was very eager to meet. after one coffee date he clearly lost interest. i felt crushed. suddenly i was doubting every angle i had ever posted on instagram, wondering if i had accidentally created a version of myself that was better than the real thing. of course he could’ve lost interest for other reasons, but it’s where my brain always lands. i do not edit my pictures or use any filters, but i still felt like i had misled him or that i was simply less attractive in real life. i know other feel this way at times, but it still hurts. this was also my first date and i was very, very nervous!

then there was the opposite situation. i talked to this incredibly attractive guy for a couple of months. he seemed charming and full of personality based on his social media. he was very interested and still is. but when we finally facetimed, he was quite slow, uneducated, boring, and unaware of himself and everything around him. he was nothing like the image he had created. and at the same time, i know it was partly my fault because i had built half of that fantasy on my own. i kept it going though and made myself aware that i had made false expectations, but with each face time call it simply got worse. i ended things between us as we had a lot of personality differences. i feel so mean to admit that about him, but it’s the truth.

now i am moving to a new city soon, and there is this guy i feel like i could really click with. but because we are far apart and have too much time to analyse each other online, i am scared that when i will want to meet him, i will be fixated on our differences from our online presence. i am also scared that i will not match the version of me he MIGHT have built up in his head. i’m a hypocrite.

i do not want to change who i am. i just do not want the online version of me to feel like a trap.
on top of all this, i am feeling weighed down by my virginity. i used to be eager to meet someone and finally run that mile, but now intimacy scares me just as much as the dating part. everything feels confusing and unpredictable, and i am trying to figure out how to make sense of it.

i’m aware a lot of this insecurity is fuelled by the rejection i had experienced as a child and as an adult, but lately it’s sort of become heavy.

(those who are looking to pull the “go to therapy” card, please know that i’m actively in therapy but LOVE to hear the opinions of the people! thank you for the love!)",1,1764041324.0,askgaybros,3,1.0,False

I used to be a PhD student at an Ivy League school and now the simple task of updating and editing my resume is incredibly difficult. I struggle to make simple decisions, write clearly, and finish any task I start. I literally cannot write for shit. I can't think of the right words to say in speech or writing. I just stare at my page and rewrite the same sentence over and over again. I used to be a writer. My short-term memory is so bad. I can't stand living like this. My parents think I'm lazy, and I haven't worked in almost three years. THREE YEARS. I need to do something to make money and have more autonomy, especially in making treatment decisions. But I literally feel so stupid and incapable of basic responsibility. My brain is gone and, I doubt sometimes if I will ever get it back. I've been treating tickborne illness for two years. I feel like my brain fog should have lifted by now. I've had some improvements in other symptoms, but nothing has touched the brain fog, disassociation, or vision issues. I am in a bad mental place right now. Any words of encouragement or advice is greatly appreciated.

Treatments I have NOT tried: IV antibiotics, dapsone protocol, disulfiram, pulsing, or adding in antibiotics with better blood-brain barrier penetration (I have only taken doxy and azithromycin, which are good but not great), \*affordabililty is an issue  
Treatments I have tried: oral antibiotics (continuous thearpy with azithro and doxy), antimalarials (Tafenoquine + Mepron), methylene blue, and herbs (not full-blown Buhner protocol, just a few herbs at a time - the ones from Research Nutritionals and another from Cowden), mold illness treatment (binders and antifungals for 1+ years), heavy metal chelation (DMSA), addressing vitamin and nutrient deficiencies, NAD+ IM shots (tried 100 mg per week for 6 weeks - no noticeable change), LDN (made me WORSE)  
Should I be more aggressive with the herbs? I just don't want to spend more money than I already am. I already pay over $500 a month on supplements and medications...Probably more I just haven't calculated it. ",3,1764041175.0,Lyme,5,1.0,False

As Amy comes around, she is wrapped in a blanket, being held by Dan on the couch. 

“Well that didn’t disappoint!” Dan says with a satisfied smile. He sits up and hands Amy a glass of water. After she drinks he holds her close. She snuggles in enjoying the skin contact. 

“You know, it’s my turn to take sexy pictures of you.” Dan is taken aback by this. “Come to think of it, I don’t even have your picture on my desk! That’s not fair!”

Dan thinks about this for a moment. She has a point. As much as he loves showing her off and she loves showing him off, they don’t take many pictures. He quickly decides this is no joke. 

Dan smiles. “You have a great point Baby Girl. We really don’t take many pictures together, or of me alone. We need to fix that.”

Amy kisses Dan. “Thank you for not making a joke about it. From now on we start saving memories.”

Dan grabs his phone. “It’s early let’s see if the kids have anything.” He shoots a text to the family chat. 

‘Amy and I are working on a project. Do any of you have a recent picture of me or of Amy and I together? Text them over. Thanx!’

Within seconds a reply from Kayla:

“I would pay a lot of money to have a picture of you two, when I caught you 2 in the act!!!”

Within seconds Amy replied:

‘Which time????’

“You’re as bad as my kids! Don’t egg them on!” Dan says laughing. 

Within minutes Jade sends a couple. One of Dan holding Katie and of them together at a family Sunday dinner. 

Rachel sends pictures of them with Graham.  Also one of Dan asleep in the recliner and Graham laying on his chest.  

Julie sends a picture of Dan rough housing on the floor with Todd and Russ.  

Kayla sends a couple of pictures. One from behind them holding hands. Another from a fire pit, of  them snuggling on the couch. 

Amy’s phone pings in the kitchen, Dan goes and retrieves it.  There was a message from Jade. 

‘I have some that would be for you two only to see. Some get very explicit.’

Amy and Dan look at each other. 

“I have no idea what all she might have.” Dan hesitates. “Knowing what we did, I don’t know about this.”

Amy types back:

“Nothing worse than PG-13 please.”

The 3 dots blink.

The first picture is of him in is natural state. Cowboy hat, long sleeved shirt and wranglers, leaning on one of his Jeeps.  

“That is the real you!” Amy exclaims. “Sexy and don’t care.”

The next one is Dan in a tuxedo, from a wedding. “Oh look James Bond!” Amy teases. They both have a good laugh. 

Then a picture shows up of Dan laying in bed, a sheet covering the lower half of his body. Obviously taken post sex, a relaxed smile on his face. The silver in his goatee was beginning to show. One arm above his head, muscles on full display. He was younger, but not as fit as today. Amy squeaks, and stares at the photo. She quickly types back;

‘That’s enough for now!!!! Damn that is sexy!’

Three dots appear:

‘They get MUCH hotter than that. I need to attack my husband now!’

Then she was gone. 

Amy stands up grabs Daddy’s hand and leads him to the bedroom. 

“Daniel we are going to recreate that picture only this time that smile is because of me!”

“Yes dear!” As he crawls onto the bed and gets into position. Arm above his head, the sheet barely hiding his manhood. His body still flushed from earlier events. He looks at Amy, standing before him bare ass naked directing him into position. She begins to take pictures and he can’t help but to smile. Soon Amy crawls into bed next to him and they look at the pictures. 

“Oh my word Daniel! You have gotten sexier, look!”

Dan looks at the picture.  He is definitely in better shape, the goatee is completely silver.  The look on his face was different. In this one there was no stress. Just a man who has found peace. 

“It’s sexier because in this one, I love the woman taking the picture.”

Before Dan can stop her, Amy sends the picture to Jade, then captions it:

“He’s still got it!!”

Dan stared at the wicked smile on Amy’s face.  

“That was a female power play, wasn’t it.”

“Damn right. Just making sure she knows it’s mine.”

XOXOXOXO 

The alarm goes off at 6:30. Amy reaches over and shuts it off.  She walks over and grabs her cellphone off the charger. She starts typing:

‘I’m sorry about the dick comment l made at the end last night. A little insecurity crept in. Alright a lot. But it’s not your problem.  Thanks for being a friend.”

She crawls back in bed next to Dan.  

“Who was the text message for?” He mumbles, trying to avoid the morning. 

“Jade. I had to tell her my last comment was a dick move and I was sorry.”

Her phone pings. It was a message from Jade:

‘Didn’t notice. To busy having impure thoughts! Love you 2’

Amy types back:

‘Me too!’

Dan rolls Amy onto her back then  gets on top of her, the tip of his cock teasing her folds. 

“There are mornings I wake up and see you, I just want to slide my cock into you to start the day.”

“Like this morning?” Amy teases.

“I want to wake you some mornings by sliding into that beautiful ass. Some mornings in your perfect kitty.”

“Daddy wants to get kinky in the morning!”

“Yes I do. Not every morning but some mornings I wake up wanting you so much, I can’t wait for the shower.”

“You can do whatever you want Daddy.”

Dan smiles as he moves Amy to the edge of the bed, so her head hangs off.  He slowly lowers himself down till he sucks his balls into her mouth. Curse words fill the air. Amy loves when she makes him curse. She releases one testicle, but sucks the other one deeper and tugs slightly. Dan’s knees buckle. 

She releases him and opens her mouth. He slowly slides his manhood past her lips.  Amy slides her tongue on the top of his shaft.  

“Fuck, Baby Girl! That mouth is incredible.” 

In this position, her throat willingly accepts his cock. Slowly sliding in and out, each time going a little further down her throat, each time coming out more soaked with saliva. In the forth stroke, his balls are pressed up against her nose.  

“You are the best my dear.” Dan growls. “Taking my cock down that beautiful throat!” Pulling out to let Amy catch a breath as he rubs the saliva all over her face. Then slides in a little faster. The strokes become firmer. “You are such a good slut taking Daddy’s cock.”

When Dan called her a good slut  something clicked inside her. The desire to please Daddy. He was being very careful not to push her past her limits. On his next thrust, she grabbed his buttocks and held him in her throat. She could feel his cock twitch.

“I’m cumming!”

Amy held him tight as the first rope entered her throat. She had to release him as one more rope in her mouth and two on her face. She coughed up the first two which landed on her face. 

Dan quickly pulled her up and held onto her while she caught her breath.  Amy immediately shoved Daddy onto his back and proceeded to rub her wet kitty all over his face. Daddy started licking and sucking, like his life depended on it. 

“Eat me Daddy! Make me squirt!”

In a few seconds she had stopped grinding because it was all she could do to stay vertical as his tongue worked her folds. She could feel her brain shut down and the raw animalistic pleasure take over. The orgasms building deep inside her!

“Oh fuck me Daddy! I’m coming.” 

She let loose with a shrill cry and unleashed all over Dan and the bed, 3 times. Soaking everything on the bed with her juices. She rolled over and off Dan completely spent. Cum completely covering her face. Body still quivering with pleasure.  Dan rolled over and spread her legs. Beginning to vigorously massage the outside of her kitty. Thus causing her to gush one last time.  

“Oh Daddy!”

Dan kissed her deeply, she moaned into his mouth. Overwhelmed from the last few minutes. 

One last kiss and Dan hopped out of bed. “Time to make the coffee!” The smugness in his voice, expressing the satisfaction of turning Amy into a quaking 110 pound mass of mind numbed, sexual satisfaction.

on a CTO, and, despite dose reductions, it is still making me crushingly tired and inattentive. Is this normal? This pattern of fatigue only emerged after I was put on the medicine.

I was on 400mg LAI, then 300mg LAI, and now 200mg LAI (which is supposedly ‘low dose’). I am also on 0.4 blood levels for lithium, and 100mg atomoxetine. Lowering the dose did nothing.

I’ve checked all possible confounds and:
Thyroid is fine
No deficiencies
No sleep apnea
Sleeping 10-14 hours a day
I exercise 4x a week
I do 10,000 steps a day (akathisia)
I eat enough calories
I drink enough water
I’m young (20)
My testosterone is high-normal
Stable mood
I get sunlight each morning when I wake
I’m not chronically stressed
I have no parasites
I don’t have CFS
I don’t have idiopathic hypersomnia
I don’t drink coffee
i don’t use illegal drugs
I don’t drink alcohol
I don’t live near toxins
No black mold
Don’t have any comorbid physical conditions

Doctors refuse to prescribe stimulants, modafinil, or anything like that. I have tried many supplements, prescription drugs, and so on for fatigue but none have helped.

My CTO got renewed for another 6 months. I don’t know what to do because I am extremely fatigued and cognitively stifled. I am in university and, although high functioning due to natural intelligence, I am struggling to engage with content and peers.

I have to imagine it is the 70-80% occupancy of D2/D3 that aripiprazole has combined with its low intrinsic action.

this is where i get confused. nobody owes me attraction and i’m not sitting here begging for validation. but in india a lot of men are attracted to trans women in private and terrified of being seen with us outside. they hide behind the word preference like it’s some spiritual truth when half the time it’s just fear of society aunties uncles bros memes all of it.

1p61ijk,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Jibreal_Khan/comments/1p61ijk/how_to_fix_porn_induced_erectile_dysfunction/,How To Fix Porn Induced Erectile Dysfunction.,"There are a number of reasons why watching porn causes a person to have erectile dysfunction. And when I use the term erectile dysfunction, I mean that the person is unable to get an erection while he is being intimate with a real person. This is quite damaging to the self-image of the person that you are being intimate with and damaging to your own confidence as a man, knowing that you cannot satisfy the needs of your spouse.

**Reason - 1**  
The first reason why porn causes an erectile dysfunction is simply due to the fact that it is significantly more stimulating than real life intimacy. Think about what an average porn session might look like, you are browsing through dozens of naked women, different shapes and sizes, doing absolutely whatever you can think off. This releases an absurd about of dopamine into your brain and causes you to get desensitized to the lower dopamine release from real life intimacy.

**Reason - 2**  
The second reason that contributes to erectile dysfunction is that fact that most people when they are viewing porn, they are masturbating to it, and it is usually with a firm grip. What this does is that, once, again it desensitizes your genitals to all other forms of softer touch.

**Reason - 3**  
The third reason why you might experience erectile dysfunction is due to you having developed fetishes. Years of watching porn and pursuing strange and novel experiences has led you to develop fetishes. Not your brain has been rewired to only associates those strange sexual acts with pleasure. All other forms of intimacy are no longer that exciting to your brain.

**Can you recover?**  
The good news is that you can fully recover from a porn induced erectile dysfunction. Your brain has the ability to rewire itself and this is known as neuroplasticity. With the right protocols you can bring your brain back to it default settings and heal your erectile dysfunction.

**How long does it take to recover?**  
The answer to this question entirely depends on how bad the damage is. If you have been watching porn for decades and you have been using it multiple times a day, then obvious, it is going to take a bit longer to recover. Additionally, if you strictly adhere to the protocols that I am going to describe, then your recovery is going to accelerate significantly. Lastly, your time for recovery, strongly depends on how many relapses you have. If you are still relapsing every few days or every week, then recovery is going to take far longer.

But let's say you are strictly adhering to all the protocols that I describe, and you have a good system in place that prevents you from relapsing, then I would say that most people can make a full recovery in 1-6 months (just my opinion).

# The foundation

This part of the protocol is going to sound very cliche, yet it something that plays a critical role in your recovery. These are your 3 core pillars of health: your sleep, your diet and exercise. Each of these things significantly impact your brain health and its ability to rewire itself.

**Sleep**  
If you are someone who has terrible sleep hygiene: you go to bed at random times, you don’t get adequate hours of sleep, you view bright lights from your cellphone or laptop before bed, you don’t get enough sunlight during the day, you have stimulants like coffee or energy drinks close to bedtime, then guess what, your sleep quality is going to be quite terrible and a result your recovery is going to be rather slow.

Additionally, poor sleep quality can also put you at risk of relapsing, because sleep has shown to play a significant role when it comes to impulse control and if your impulse control is compromised due to poor sleep, then you are putting yourself in a pretty vulnerable position.

If you are someone who is really looking to optimize their sleep, I would highly recommend that you watch one of Andrew Huberman’s podcasts on sleep optimization. It covers all things that you need to know in order to have high quality sleep. Things like: What time to eat? What time to view sunlight? How long to view sunlight? what time to avoid light?

**Diet**  
Recovery happens when your brain stops receiving hyper stimulation and in the absence of hyperstimulation, it begins to recalibrate itself. One of the ways it does so, is by improving the sensitivity and the number of its dopamine receptors to now accommodate for the fact that there is no longer that flood of dopamine coming in from pornography. However, If you are someone that consumes a lot of processed food. Things like chocolates, burgers, soda, chips etc. Then you might be greatly slowing down your recovery. That’s because you are flooding your brain with dopamine and now it doesn’t get the chance to recalibrate itself.

You don’t want to just quit one addiction and replace it with another addiction. You want to give your brain a window during which it is not being bombarded with hyperstimulation. Additionally, another property of fast food is that it generates cravings for instant pleasure. You might have noticed this, each time you consume highly processed food, like a chocolate cake, your cravings for sex just skyrocket and this puts you in quite a vulnerable position and could lead to a relapse.

What I would recommend is that you really focus on cleaning out your diet. Remove all processed food from it and replace it with whole natural single ingredient food. Things like meat, eggs, honey, dates, fruits, vegetables. These are quality ingredients that assist in healing your brain rather than help destroy it.

**Exercise**  
Exercise is not just about shaping muscles, losing weight, or improving athletic performance. When you exercise and really get that sweat going, then you brain is soaked in a cocktail of neurochemicals that are just so nourishing for it.

Exercise is not only going to help your brain rewire faster and heal your erectile dysfunction, but it is also going fill the void that was left behind by porn and it absolutely essential to fill this void with healthy sources of dopamine, else you are going to be vulnerable to relapses.

# Speeding up your recovery

Once you are no longer relapsing and you have your 3 core pillars of health fixed. Your diet is good, your sleep is good, and you are working out consistently. Then you are on your way to recover successfully from erectile dysfunction. It might take a couple of months, so just stick to your healthy habits and trust the process.

**Signs that you have recovered.**  
One way that you can get some sort of a hint that your erectile dysfunction has been cured is that fact that you will start getting morning wood and you will get frequent erections even at times when you are not looking at something sexually arousing.

So don’t try to see if your erectile dysfunction is cured by looking at porn of hypersexualized images, I have seen people try this time and time again and it just ends up in relapses and undoing your progress.

I am now going to tell you about 2 tools, that in my opinion, will significantly speed up your recovery. It might just take you half or even a third of time to recover if you incorporate these tools in your life.

**Tool 1 - Fasting**  
The first tool is fasting. Going without food for a duration of time has shown to significantly boost neuroplasticity and this allows your brain to recover much faster.

The reason why fasting is so effective is because when you voluntarily deprive your body of food, then it switches its source of energy and it starts using your fat as fuel. When this energy switch happens, your body gets the message that ‘there is a scarcity of resources’ and this causes it to start cleaning itself and burning of dysfunctional cells as a source of energy. This process is known as autophagy and fasting plays a key role in promoting it.

Additionally, fasting promotes something called neurogenesis, which is the creation of new neurons. This combination of autophagy and neurogenesis is vital for rewiring your brain and with fasting you can accelerate both these mechanisms.

**Tool 2 - Ketogenic Diet**  
Now fasting is great, but you can’t fast forever 24 hours day, 7 days a week. Or perhaps you are someone who is on the skinny side of things or you are someone who really cares about his performance in the gym or there could be many other reasons why you are not looking forward to the idea of fasting.

However, you can still get the benefits of fasting: the autophagy and neurogenesis by following a fasting mimicking diet, which is called the ‘ketogenic diet’. You might have come across it in passing, it seems to have picked up some steam in communities centered around weight loss. But it is also just a fantastic tool when it come to getting the benefits of fasting, without actually fasting. To put it simply, a ketogenic diet is when you consume little carbs, typically between 20-50 gms and mainly consume fats and proteins.

**To the skeptics**  
Now some of you are probably skeptical about the effectiveness of intermittent fasting and the ketogenic diet, especially when it comes to overcoming porn addiction and, to be fair, there hasn’t been a relevant study done on the impact on ketogenic diet and intermittent fasting on porn addiction.

However, there are studies that have shown that the ketogenic diet has a positive impact on substance use disorders. There are studies that show that ketogenic diet helps reduce symptoms of alcohol withdrawal. And lastly, there is a study that shows that ketogenic diet also reduces cravings for alcohol.

So granted that none of these things are actually porn. However, these substances behave very similar to porn, meaning they release large amounts of dopamine and are addictive. It is my hypothesis, based on my experience working with dozens of porn addicts, that ketogenic diet could be a potential tool that helps rewire the brain from porn addiction and reduce cravings for porn.

But when I do my feelings are so strong too soon. Idk what to do. Even right now at my internship, I see this really cute girl.

1. I saw her going into the elevator with another intern, probably to grab coffee. And I lost it, I was so furious I couldn't focus at work. It was like someone dropped a weight on my heart.

2. I am thinking about her every moment when she's in. Hoping she comes to my desk. If she doesn't I end up texting her to see if she wants to go get fresh air or something. just excuses to talk to her.

3. I'm so worried I can't tell what she's want. We talk great and laugh together, but I don't even know if she has a boyfriend. We've talked a fair amount and I haven't heard about one. Can't figure if I should back off or try to approach her more often.

4. I can't stop thinking about her, she can dictate my mood unknowingly by how much attention she gives me. I could be mad she didn't come say hi and then as soon as she comes my mood will light up

5. I overthink so much, I don't want to be a guy she ends up avoiding, but I also don't want to be slow and lose her to somebody else, if I haven't already.

He hasn’t gone outside in ten years but now is desperate to and yells at the front door constantly. We took him to the vet and he got on blood pressure meds that he has been on for several days now. But they haven’t helped his distress. He constantly paces even if he’s just walking back and forth on a coffee table. He is obsessively following my mom and freaks out if he can’t see her. Last night was a turning point though. My mom had been complaining about him waking her up at 3am the past couple of weeks. The vet said the blood pressure meds should help by now with his sleep. I stayed up until 3 with him trying to calm and comfort him. When I fell asleep at 3:15 he seemed okay. But he woke my mom up at 4 and me up at 5 and at 6 the house was awake. So he had someone with him literally all night. So he wasn’t alone the lights were on and he had food and water and a litter box. Now we are concerned that his quality of life isn’t as high as we thought it was. We called our vet and she said we might need to start thinking about if it’s the end or not.

Thoughtfully curated fruit platters (some fruit is left whole, some is cut in half. It’s so whimsical!), yummy pancakes and waffles fresh from the freezer, drizzled honey in **iced** coffee (WHY) and store-bought quiche that’s been sitting in the oven for an undetermined period of time (Meghan, for the love of god, you’re _not_ Ina, so please stop trying).

Kaiser, who once ridiculed Pippa Middleton for the same dumb obvious entertaining advice Meghan is now peddling, LOVED Meghan’s “nice little video”:
> Give it two days and they’ll call this Frozen Pancake-gate!! Everything Meghan does or says is so scandalous to them. The Frozen Pancakes That Brought A Nation To Its Knees! Meanwhile, Meghan spoke to People Magazine exclusively last week to offer some holiday entertaining tips. **I learned that Harry’s favorite part of Thanksgiving is the gravy!**

Last sentence bolded by me because it’s hilarious and somewhat sad she’s so excited to learn that…Harry likes gravy.

Speaking of pancakes, frozen or not, even Kaiser wasn’t that keen on them as a breakfast item back in 2018 when she was writing about Pippa:
> As for what Pippa says about breakfasts… I know I should be outraged that she’s dissing the more American-style breakfast, but here are a few things: most Americans aren’t really sitting down to eat pancakes, bacon and syrup every day anyway. That’s a special-occasion breakfast for most people. Secondly, I can’t eat that kind of stuff early in the morning either. I’m like Pippa – all I want is some yogurt and a piece of fruit, like a banana, and I’m good. **Thinking about scarfing down pancakes and bacon early in the morning leaves me cold.**

Anyway, Kaiser’s post on Meghan’s hostessing tips hasn’t gotten much traction (and the royalty tea sub where a lot of the CB commenters have migrated, hasn’t even posted about it yet) because what can they really say? We love a queen who tries to sell us overprice crepe mix but then recommends eating frozen pancakes! A duchess who wants to make everyone feel so comfortable and cared for, but only _after_ the butler has loudly announced her title to the room.

I let the conversation run itself after initially asking ""How do you deal with stress during the day?"" and the agents ended up making plans to have tea together.

Idk why, but I found it insanely funny. This \*exact\* scenario happened during a real focus group I ran previously. The participants in that one were trying to exchange phone numbers!

Me, M20 currently at 2nd year college in an engneering course and my now ex, F19 in a HM course has been together for around 2 years. We've started dating a few months before graduation in senior high school, and we're classmates for 2 years there. I can say we were on good terms for a year, we were going on dates almost every week, and I even introduced her to my family. Her family is struggling financially since she has 4 other siblings and only their father is the one providing for them. So those dates every week, it was all on me. Mind you, we're both students and luckily I have the money to spend since I have a scholarship grand that gives me PHP8,000 per month. I was fine with spending some since I really did love her. However, she never once introduced me to her family. We've talked about that matter several times, but she insisted that her house was pretty bad and she'll get embarassed if I ever visit them. I got pretty upset since it's not fair on my part and she already knows that I won't leave her with that shallow of a reason. But we got over it and we continued this routine of dates every week or every other week just so we can be together. All of our dates, in those 2 years, have been on my tab. I never once complained, since I know that when we'd graduate and have our own jobs, she can be the one to spend on us. Buuuut, in the summer of our first year college, a friend of mine recommended a summer job in a coffee shop near us, since it was more suited for her with her course and all, I said that they should take her instead. And so she got hired and we were very happy. To help her, I always drive her to work with my motor. Even if it's 5am in the morning, I'll always get up and take her there. I even bring her food whenever I don't have anything to do. Her work continued even when it was the start of school. And I continued helping her even if my schedule is way beyond hers, like she has to get to her school at 8am and me in like 10am, I'll get up early to drive her and then go to my own school. I endured all of that, since I really really do love her. But for 2 years of those sacrifices, efforts, and gifts I gave her, I never once received one back. I never received a gift on my birthday from her, I never once got treated to a date even if she has the money, dang she never even invited me to a date, it was always me. It's like I was trying to make something work and she's just going with it without putting in effort. But I was dumb, I just accepted all of it without any second thoughts because I truly believe that it's all an investment, and she's worth those invesments. I even gave her a phone since she got a crappy one.

But then just recently, when I asked her ""can't wait na ikaw naman bumawi"" (can't wait for you to get back)(like efforts and such) after I drove her to her school, she just said ""anong bawi? Next life nalang bumawi"" (what do you mean get back? In the next life). 

That broke the shit out of me. I just now realized how dumb I am to force things to someone like that. I broke up with her, and now I just need the phone I gave her back since I can't stand the thought that she'll have somebody else to chat and be lovey with, with my OWN phone.

This might be just a one sided story since it's all on my perspective, but man I think I did the right thing. I am so dumb, I feel like I wasted 2 years of my life for nothing. If I give a rough estimation, I think I spent like 80k on her😭",1,1764039468.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

For some context, she's been absent for a majority of the year due to medical reasons and has only been able to join us for two classes, including the one where she asked me to be her project partner. So I've only ever interacted with her once or twice before that.

During our previous interactions, I realised she was really... Talkative, but it was always really self-centered. (Always bringing the discussion back to herself, not letting someone finish a story before starting her own, etc) She seems really nice but something about her doesn't match with me, which is alright, we can't be friends with everyone.

Today, we went into town to buy some material for said project and I quickly realised I found her annoying and pushy.

She seems to have a lot of troubles with certain boundaries. For example, I told her I had multiple tattoos and instead of asking 'can I see them?' she told me 'well, you need to show me the one on your shoulder and pictures of the two others'. I don't mind showing my tattoos, far from it, but there was something that irked me in the way she said it.

Same thing when I told her I would be going to get coffee with a crush, she told me 'you'll have to tell me how it went, send me a message with an emoji describing how it's going.' again, I wouldn't mind telling her how it went, but, again, the way she phrased it made it sound almost like an order.

What disturbs me the most is that we've only known each other for two classes and we haven't hung out together outside of that at all. And I feel like she's not asking me but ordering me to tell her these things, almost as if she was entitled to them.

After we bought what we needed, I walked back with her to her doctor's office for her appointment, because it wasn't a big detour and she asked me to. She asked me at least twice if I could stay with her and I told her that I couldn't every time. And right before she left for her appointment, she told me 'I like you, I like your sense of humour, I'm going to be hanging around you a lot more.' and the only thought that crossed my mind was 'oh, please no.' 

Would I be the asshole if I told her after our project that I don't want to be friends with her?

After trying Gemini 3.0, I’m convinced it’s the fastest path from idea to production. Inside AI Studio, I can assemble an app in about five minutes—prompt, wire the tools, preview, and then deploy straight to Google Cloud. Auth, APIs, logging, and a clean UI come out of the box, so I spend my time on product, not plumbing.

My latest project is DocuDeck AI, a tiny tool with big leverage. Upload a PDF or Word document and Gemini 3.0 analyzes the content, extracts key points, and generates a professional PowerPoint deck in seconds. The interface is intentionally minimal: drag-and-drop upload, clear progress, smart headings, and balanced color themes—all auto‑tuned by the model.

What this enables

Instant iteration: ship a working MVP over a coffee break.
Production confidence: seamless Google Cloud deployment and observability.
Better UX by default: polished UI components without heavy frontend work.

(Injury advice),"Bad Day: Showed up to work 30 minutes before shift and brewed a fresh pot of coffee for those on the last shift still getting up and those coming in. The typical flow is that members (including probies) usually relax for an hour to drink coffee before starting checks and chores. Long story short one of our veteran members didn’t take too kindly to me and gave me a pretty hard time about everything from my physical appearance to my laziness and lack of communication with a new crew (I disagree with all of these takes but that’s not the point). I ended up dumping my coffee early and doing most morning duties alone. Ultimately, the guy who didn’t take to kindly to me ended up working on my training for the day and decided to do some attack line and search training which he is known for pushing extremely hard on. I did my search just fine and got some good remarks from the members on shift but once I went to stretch some hose that’s where some things went wrong. 
 
We were simulating smoke conditions down a set of stairs I had only  been down a few times before.  I stretched a line, had them charge it, and made entry. I made it to the bottom of the stairs but couldn’t see anything so I stayed low and reached forward expecting a door but realized that I was only on a landing followed by 3-4 more stairs. I fell face first down the stairs and landed mostly on my outstretched right arm. I felt a little pain but didn’t think much of it. I recouped, grabbed my hose line and started moving through the props. As I was dragging the line I think the hose got kinked or something so I planted my right arm and pulled with my left. As I did I felt my right shoulder dislocate posteriorly and almost as a reflex I jerked backwards while still gripping the door frame resetting the shoulder. It hurt but since it wasn’t still dislocated I figured it was just a fluke and continued with my attack. I tried to stay tripod position and move the hose through the maze but I ended up having my right shoulder “slip” 2 more times before tapping out. It was extremely embarrassing to tap out on training in front of all those people but my shoulder started hurting pretty bad afterwards. 
 
Long story short I delayed reporting but ended up getting to a dr and am now off for a minimum of 4 weeks while I wait on more testing. The DR said that best case scenario because of it slipping multiple times is that I do some PT but deal with lifelong instability due to my labrum and rotator cuff. Worst case scenario is the testing reveals a tear and I am off for 6 mos-a year recovering. 

Backstory: I turn 30 next year after a late career change from corporate misery to a job that I genuinely love (EMS more than fire but love both). After speaking to the doc he said that no matter what I will probably deal with some form of instability for the rest of my life with a medium to high risk injuring it again. Unfortunately, there are no public EMS only agencies in my area and I am now at a loss for where to go from here. I am sure I can recover enough to stay in the fire service on paper but I NEVER want to be the guy who is a liability on the fire ground and I’m nervous to even go back to training like that for fear of injuring it again. I do have a bachelors degree in a low demand IT field with no desire to go back to corporate life and I would love to stay here in the fire service but I’m already on the older side of transition and am worried about lasting a whole career over here.

Mid-70s, walks with a slight limp, always fixes things himself, and says hello in this calm, steady voice. I figured he was just retired and enjoying peace.

Last month the elevator got stuck between floors, and he happened to be inside with me. While we were waiting for maintenance, he pulled out this little metal toolkit and started calmly checking the emergency panels like he’d done it a hundred times before. I asked jokingly, “What, you used to be some kind of engineer?”

He looked up and said, “Not quite. I used to fly into places where the engineers couldn’t go.”

Turns out he was a **disaster-rescue helicopter pilot** for an international humanitarian team back in the 80s and 90s. He flew into earthquake zones, typhoon-hit villages, collapsed mining sites basically the places everyone else was trying to escape from. He showed me photos later: entire mountainsides wiped out, rooftops barely peeking over flood water, and him landing a chopper on what looked like a patch of gravel barely big enough for a bicycle.

Every Saturday morning now, I go upstairs with two cups of coffee, and he gives me these “flight lessons” in his living room. No actual controls, obviously just old manuals, hand-drawn diagrams, radio call examples, how to read wind, how to steady your breathing when you’re hovering above chaos.

The man can still describe microbursts and tail rotor failures like he experienced them yesterday. And when he talks about the people he pulled out of disaster zones, his whole face changes like he’s right back there.

It’s honestly wild that for years I thought he was just the guy who watered his plants on the balcony… and now he’s teaching me how to “fly” from a recliner chair.

It's made me the happiest I've ever been but also the loneliest. I've picked up more hours at both of my two jobs to make more money; I figured if I'm not doing anything I might as well make some extra cash. I've always been surrounded by girls and was everyone's GBF in high school, I've had no issue with making girlfriends my whole life but can never seem to make any other gay friends.... I do have anxiety, but I don't think I've ever let that get in the way of my friendships and connections. 

I'm extremely grateful my family is very supportive of me and my sister is also a lesbian. Sometimes I will hang out with her and her gf/ her other friends and I truly value my time with them and always look forward to it. I almost envy my sisters ability to make friends and social connections so easily. I really don't know why it's such a struggle for me. 

  
I did high school out in Western MA and although there was a very limited queer community (besides Northampton), I met all of my gay friends there. Once I moved about an hour and a half away and started weeding the real friends out of the filler friends my circle became VERY small and I have no one near me. I've used this alone time (my Sundays off) to discover who I am and what I enjoy doing, like trying new coffee shops, going to the gym, cooking and eating healthy, reading, learn Japanese, watch anime, and play video games.

I do try to put myself out there and even went on vacation to Florida alone and stopped in a gay bar in ST. Petersburg to try and make friends..... I stayed for 45 minutes and didn't talk to anyone. I don't understand why it's such a struggle to make other platonic gay friends. I understand that I'm more than likely the problem, but I don't know what to do in order to fix this. When I've tried to have platonic gay friends in the past, I usually get ditched once they have a BF.

Does anyone have any recommendations on what I should do to make more gay friends as a 23M near Providence RI? ",1,1764038257.0,askgaybros,5,0.67,False

1p60wsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelLinks/comments/1p60wsn/councils_academy_the_lycan_brothers_gifted_mate/,Council's Academy: The Lycan Brothers Gifted Mate,"I only have thirty minutes left before I have to report to the kitchen for my duties. I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.",1,1764038168.0,NovelLinks,0,1.0,False

1p60ufv,https://www.reddit.com/r/AvoidantBreakUps/comments/1p60ufv/help_me_understand_i_am_lost/,"Help me understand, I am lost","I am not sure I am in the right place either as I am just gob smacked. I’ll describe my situation. Been in a relationship with a wonderful man for 2.5 years. First 1.5 years was amazing, he was the first to say he loved me and he really is an amazing person who wants to make everyone happy. 

He is plagued by worry, anxiety, and everything gets to him so even if I say something like he should have done the dishes, it would become a whole night of silence for saying something normally and not with any anger. I knew about all this from the start.

But he recognised it and always worked through it, had had a therapist, a spiritual coach, a life coach. I just became more careful about not saying too much as to me, these are smaller things. I can always do the dishes, he and I are good together. His mum loves me, his kids love me and he loves me. I love him. 

He was divorced before we met and money has always been a sort of thing for him - that he built his life by working hard and saving, his marriage of 14 years broke up as she asked for a divorce but they were not in love for a long time, and after that he gave up half his income/ earnings to her so he is left with a much smaller retirement pot - he wanted to retire early as he doesn’t care about money, just wants enough to live a decent life. Anyway so he is still working… always said his ex-wife randomly gave up her job one day, never went back to it or they could have built much more as a double income family. 

I come in when he is already divorced, he takes great care to introduce me to his kids slowly as he is a great dad and wants to make sure the kids can handle it (kids live 60% of time with mum and 40% with him - the ex wife and him are now on amicable terms, there’s no hostility). 

Him and me have an amazing relationship, I can’t believe how lovely he is and all round nice guy (I had enough jerks in the past). Our interests are quite different but I show up for all the stuff important in his life and for 2.5 years we are together atleast 5 days out of 7 and we travel a lot. My friends and family love him.

This year I felt a bit strange when we travelled for new year, I fell sick and while he was nice, it wasn’t really a loving or caring side that I saw, almost just normal but I would have cared more for a friend if I travelled and they were sick. Anyway, still a good holiday and we came back.

Second holiday a few months later (in between all was fine, according to me), he seemed checked out and in his own head, no physical contact, enjoying the holiday well enough but physically and emotionally I felt something was off. I thought he has some stresses as he often does. Tried to talk about it when we came back, he didn’t really give any answer, said you are right but nothing else.

Then changed to good again, we went to his home town, met his family, met lots of his very close friends and it was brilliant. We didn’t fight or have any less than happy day - I was surprised but joyful that maybe the previous few months were just him working through it. 

Came back, and then somehow there was no sex for maybe 8 weeks. I put it down to him having some minor health issues, not feeling great, being tired. For his daughter’s birthday, we celebrated it together with her friends and his ex-wife, all great. 

I had a big birthday and he helped me plan it, did a lot to surprise me, gave me so many gifts, balloons, a lovely dinner and then we had a party later with all of his friends and my friends. I was over the moon as he really went above and beyond in our private birthday celebration. The only hiccup being I found a drunk text in his phone to some woman I don’t know saying he missed her. I didn’t say anything then as I didn’t want to ruin things. Then this party was ten days ago, it was great, everyone loved it and had a good time.

Three days ago, I received some bad news that my company was transitioning my role out (corporate speak). That day, he was sick from something he ate the night before and wasn’t good so I didn’t tell him this news when I went home in the evening. The best day, we went to get some coffee and that’s when I told him. To be clear, he knows I live in my own place (we live separately but either he is at my place or I am at his), that I have savings, and I didn’t say anything alarmist; just that this happened. He then deflected the conversation to something that happened in his workplace etc. I was surprised at the lack of empathy, we continued some other conversation, then he gave me a hug in the elevator when we were returning but overall, all I wanted to hear was I am here for you. But he didn’t say it.

He had made plans to go out with his friends that day for quite sometime so as he was ironing his shirt; with this at the back of my head, plus the drunk text that I had not asked about… I said, are you happy with us- as in our relationship? And very casually while ironing his shirt; he said, you are more certain of it than I am. So I asked, what do you mean? He says he is not content, that he doesn’t know what he wants. I am gob smacked as I can’t understand how this happened. He says “I wanted us to have a good time, but I had my doubts, if what I am feeling is enough” 

I asked about the woman and he says she’s just a friend and helps him through stuff. I’ve met all his friends and he has never mentioned her. But he says there’s nothing there, that there is no other woman, he is just not happy. None of this was an angry conversation - I am quite calm and so was he. I left his house and next day he texted that he is thinking of me, is concerned and sorry that he didn’t make me happy - but I reply I am happy, it’s me who doesn’t make him happy. 

I look back at the first 1.5 years as amazing, this year maybe I saw some signs but he didn’t come outright and say anything when I asked, last couple of months, amazing. Now, it’s all gone.

Now I have no job and no relationship. I am lost. ",2,1764037981.0,AvoidantBreakUps,1,1.0,False

I’ll start with this one from Ju Fufu’s trailer, pretty sure I can accurately guess what Yixuan is drinking here: a medium iced latte. Reasons being 1: the fact that the cup is transparent, hot coffee cups at shops use styrofoam due to it being a good insulator for hot drinks, whereas iced drinks use clear plastic. 2: cup size and shape, too big to be a small, but large iced coffee cups have a large bevel at the bottom (larger than the one here). 3: the layering, typically regular coffees get mixed when cream/milk is added, but lattes specifically don’t get mixed (though the drink will naturally mix when poured), you could argue the reason for the top of the drink being darker is due to shading, but it looks too dark for that, and there’s clearly the start of a gradient at the bottom.
I know all this seems dumb, but, having worked at a Dunkin, when I saw this shot my mind immediately started trying to figure out what Yixuan had ordered.

Well, it turns out that a year and 8 months ago I became a partner with my boyfriend, my sister went out with us, we took her for walks and things like that, just to make it clear I am younger than my sister by 8 years so at that time she was 26 and I was 18, at this moment I am 19 and she is 27, but without deviating from the topic everything was very good, until 3 months after I became a couple after my boyfriend, she started talking to a Guy, I didn't know who he was, the truth is I didn't know him, my sister is a single mother so wherever we went she went and my nephew went, that's how we were until my boyfriend and I made a date and we were going to the VIP cinema, well my sister didn't ask me or anything, but she simply decided that she would go with us and it was okay haha, but she wanted to go with us because she had invited that boy she met, she met him on Tiktok and he lives almost 50 km from where we live, but well it turns out that We thought that he would pick up my sister and we would each go in a car, but no, it turns out that he didn't have a car, being 35 years old, so we had to take my sister to the cinema, pay for the VIP tickets for the 4 of us and aha, well, since we paid for the seats we decided where to sit, which was at the top in one corner and they were at the bottom of our row in the other corner, when we left the movie they made a drama of us for having put them in that place, my boyfriend was not paid for the tickets or nothing, and it was okay?, then we separated and we were hanging around the square where the cinema was, and my boyfriend and I went to a place that is pure games, we got ready to play and they went to a Starbucks, at that moment my mother called me and asked me why my sister didn't answer her and I told her that I honestly didn't know where she was, since I didn't know if she would stay there to consume the coffee or go around exploring the entire square, the conversation ends there and when I get home and my mom asks me why my sister wasn't with us, and I tell her it was because she was with this boy and she tells me like she was with a boy? And I tell her yes, he is the one she always talks to in the afternoons, and well, it becomes a bigger problem because I didn't know that my sister had not told my mother that she was going to see this boy, and my sister and this boy start to say things to me because my mother scolded my sister, after that months passed, and every time I saw myself or invited my boyfriend to the house, my sister would wear clothes with low neckline, super small shorts and provocative clothes in front of my partner, which made me It made me uncomfortable, and then in September it was my sister's birthday and this boy gave her a few perfumes, well this happened one weekend, and during the week she hid several perfumes in my backpack from the University, and when her boyfriend arrived the next weekend he told her the lie that I had used those perfumes and had hidden them in my backpack, I must clarify that I am a little special with the aromas of perfumes so I didn't like the smells that those perfumes had the most At least, everyone in my house knew that I would never be able to grab my sister's perfume and that's why I have never been one to grab things that aren't mine without permission, but well that weekend my sister told her boyfriend that I had grabbed her perfume and that little boy told my mom to control me because how was it possible for me to grab things that aren't mine, what I didn't know was that even my sister-in-law had turned against me since my sister-in-law doesn't like me because put many limits on their attitude, I am their younger sister, my older brother is 30, my sister is 27 and I am 19, which is why my brother has always taken care of me since I was a baby and I get along very well with him, which is why my sister-in-law gets jealous of me and that is why she dislikes me, so my mother, seeing that they were attacking me, told them that in my life I would take those perfumes because they are not smells that I like, and there I stay, and now my sister searches through my things, my clothes, my backpack, things that could affect me, telling my mom, a few months ago I had an appointment with my Gynecologist for colic control issues and she gave me some birth control pills but I had talked to my mom about why I was taking them, my sister didn't know anything, the thing is that I take them out of my backpack and show them to my mom and dad, just to hurt me by thinking that I was taking them for birth control but no, no, My boyfriend and I have decided other things in terms of sexual relations, but I understand that anyone who sees that would think that it is due to birth control, but my annoyance was that I took them out of my backpack because I was rummaging through it just to make myself look bad in front of my parents. The week that happened, one weekend my sister's boyfriend came, we had arrived from visiting my grandfather so we were very tired, my parents fell asleep and my nephew was lying in a room where there are two beds, in one he and my sister sleep and in another I sleep, and well my sister's boyfriend arrived and they went to sleep in my bed because my nephew was in the other, I didn't have much battery in my cell phone and my charger was in my room, which is basically my sister's and mine's room, I went in as if nothing had happened, and I found my sister and her partner having sex, I was shocked, I didn't expect to go in and for them to be in that position, so I grabbed my charger and went out, I waited for that my parents got up and I told them what I saw, they didn't believe me, they didn't think that my sister was so shameless to do that in her own house and in front of her sleeping son, the next day my mother asked her to tell her the truth and she lied to her saying that the person who said that was a liar, and that then she was going to do like me, taking care of me from getting pregnant and injecting me with contraceptive methods which, well, I have never injected myself, I have only taken pills to control the colic, which implied that she had had unprotected sex, and in her own words she said ""I don't think I'll get pregnant because he can't have a family"" which no one knows if it's true or not since he didn't show her any paper confirming it and now her boyfriend makes faces at me every time he sees me because I'm a ""gossip."" My intention was never to be a gossip, I was simply worried that my nephew might wake up and see them in that uncomfortable position, but according to my boyfriend I've never noticed that my sister's boyfriend sees my butt and breasts when I wear tight clothes, which is very unusual but he still does it, so many have told me that my sister is probably jealous of me, what do you think?",1,1764037873.0,family,1,1.0,False

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.",1,1764037823.0,Contemporary_Romance,0,1.0,False

I was fired this last Friday, a week before Thanksgiving for the most ridiculous reason you will ever hear. It all started with stupid Ninox shit, a data collection program on my iPad and I had to go back to some more information and I had to use the iPad which needed to be charged. I was no longer able to charge it in my van because if I ran it more than 15 minutes sitting idle, it would sound the alarm. I was told at this particular property that no one uses this conference room and I could use it while I was working at their facility. It had a coffee maker and other things that made me think this was just another break room/conference room type thing. I went to plug my iPad in, the other plug accidentally fell out, I plugged it back in. Apparently, that plug was the receiver for their main security cameras for the bank. Not hardwired in, no lock, someone can very easily unplug it, or mistakenly knock it out. While I was still at the property for another 2 hours, no one mentioned a single thing. Until a week later, when my boss told me what actually happened and that the fire department and the security company had came out and ALMOST fined them. They did not fine them. Because of that, the company that owns the property no longer wants me to work at their properties, and since that was the biggest cash cow I no longer had a job. I will say my direct manager did fight for me, but this was above his head. I got nothing.

1p60r4k,https://www.reddit.com/r/BooksPoint/comments/1p60r4k/councils_academy_the_lycan_brothers_gifted_mate/,Council's Academy: The Lycan Brothers Gifted Mate,"I only have thirty minutes left before I have to report to the kitchen for my duties. I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.",1,1764037722.0,BooksPoint,0,1.0,False

I wake up, but the day doesn’t start… it presses down on me like a weight I can’t lift. I look in the mirror. The reflection is mine, but it’s fractured. My eyes betray every sleepless night, every anxious heartbeat. My jaw tightens. My brain spins on a frequency no one else can hear.

I walk to the kitchen. Coffee. Not for pleasure, for survival. I overthink every movement: the cup too close, the spoon too loud. My mind races ahead, imagining every judgment, every silent critique from the world I’m about to face. I am hyper-aware of the self I present—clumsy, awkward, misunderstood.

I leave the apartment and step outside. The city hums, alive and indifferent. People brush past me, and I feel like a ghost in the crowd. A woman walks by, her laugh like a spotlight. I want connection, intimacy, a spark… but my anxiety suffocates me before I can breathe.

At work, I overcompensate. Every word, every glance, every action is calculated. I’m sharp, intelligent, perceptive… but misunderstood. My temper flares, my thoughts explode internally. People see a hint of arrogance or moodiness, but they don’t see the battlefield behind my eyes. They don’t know the war I fight just to exist.

I come home, exhausted. Alone. But even in solitude, I can’t rest. Thoughts spin: missed opportunities, unspoken words, failed connections. My brain hums, racing, analyzing. Yet, somewhere inside, a flame burns. A voice whispers: “You are not defeated. You are still here. You are still fighting.”

I write again: “They may not see me, but I see me. And that’s enough… for now.”

The fire is still there. Hidden, silent, invisible to all, but it grows.

He’s since broken up but he was quite heartbroken for the following year so I didn’t really get a chance to be close with him. 

I’ve told him I liked him before and he’s rejected me saying he’s not sure about me, I get the feeling it’s more about his ex than me. We’ve always been really close friends and talk to each other every day. Generally he’s quite closed off because of his past with his family, but he always lets me know if something is bothering him. He’s also always open about the fact he’s seeing people every now and then, though it’s not very serious. 

We flirt a lot when we’re together and we have before but I sense he feels more himself this year. He’s showing me music and movies he likes and we do our bedtime hygiene routine together. He’s initiated flirting more and quite openly like joking I want to touch his chest. I don’t catch him moving away as much when I get close. I notice when he sits down his leg is always touching mine and I can lean on him without him moving away. When he’s feeling goofy he’ll stick his face up to mine and stick his tongue out. Sometimes we touch our feet or hands together and it’s quite silly but we get a good laugh out of it. We game a lot and he’s usually really hard working but I’ve gotten him to want to stay later to play with me. 

The other night, we talked about work and he put his head on the pillow on my tummy as we’re linking arms. He always makes sure I’m okay especially when I’m drunk and bought me coffee in bed when I’m hungover.

I care about him a lot but I’m scared this is how he is with close friends. I don’t want to misinterpret him again and pull us apart.


PS We had gotten drunk and done some sexual things together before. I thought he went around in his own time but he told his friend recently he’s only ever done that with me.

I’d like advise on if I should wait because I don’t want to rush and push him away. I’m not in a rush as well myself, I just don’t want to give myself false hope.",6,1764037568.0,isfp,1,1.0,False

1p60l7k,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1p60l7k/councils_academy_the_lycan_brothers_gifted_mate/,Council's Academy: The Lycan Brothers Gifted Mate,"I only have thirty minutes left before I have to report to the kitchen for my duties. I glance at the tombstone one more time before I head back to the Pack-house, feeling sad as I always do after visiting my Mother's grave.

My Mom isn't buried there, but Dad placed the tombstone to give us both a place to go to. No one seems to know where her grave is, as she died miles away from here. Mom and Dad had been running from her parents, who didn’t agree with her accepting her fated Mate.

Dad barely escaped with me, and when we came to this Pack, I was only a year old. Dad took the position of Assassin, as it was his birthright.

We were happy until I turned fourteen, and he was told I had to move into the Pack-house, waiting to be chosen by unmated males. Every female over fourteen in this Pack had to follow this rule. If my Father had known, he would have never joined this Pack—he would’ve kept running with me.

In the almost three years since I had to move into the Pack-house, I have been working in the kitchen, something I will keep doing after my Mate selects me.

""Umayza, I need you to—"" Luna's voice trails off as she frantically searches the kitchen, not realizing I'm standing right behind her. I step forward and clear my throat.

Startled, she spins around. ""Where did you come from?""

""I've been at my station since my shift started, Luna,"" I reply, noticing she brought another young female to replace me in the kitchen.

This is the day I've been dreading for the past three years—the day I get fitted for the outfit I'll wear in six months, a day I fear even more. Nearly every female in our Pack dreads that day, except maybe the High-ranking ones.

Like me, every girl in the Pack gets fitted for an outfit when she turns seventeen, then has six months to learn a dance to perform in front of all the unmated males. On that night, any male can inform the Alpha if he wants you as his Mate.

High-ranking females perform for a much smaller audience, since there are fewer unmated High-ranking males left. In my case, I should be performing for the Highest ranks as well, but for some reason, our Alpha decided I'd have a better chance if I perform for the general unmated males instead.

Most of them are fine, but there are a few I wouldn't describe as okay—and with me, most females feel that way. I have tried to get out of this performance, but our Alpha wouldn't hear of it, and Dad pleading with him didn’t work either.

Dad doesn't like the way this Pack chooses their Mates, and Dad doesn't participate in the process. He told me that he is working on a plan to get out of here. He doesn't want me to have to go through this process, and according to Dad, it is even illegal.

Until Dad can find a way out of this, I will play along with their charade, and as an Assassin's Daughter, I have mastered looking innocent to perfection—not that I am innocent at all. I have seen enough since I was moved into the Pack-house, and if I ever get the chance, I will take the Alpha and this Pack down.

Our Luna is waiting for me to step into the room where this whole ordeal will start, and I look around at all the fabric and drawings in the room. One outfit is more revealing than the other, and I want to run as our Luna holds the drawing of my outfit in front of me.

""They designed this especially for you, Umayza. It will be in scarlet red, made from lace and silk,"" Luna explains as I take a closer look. It looks more like a nightgown, and I don't think it is suited for a girl my age.

That evening, I finally see Dad for the first time in three days, and I tell him I had my measurements taken for my outfit. ""It is knee-length with a flaring silk skirt and a lace top. The V-neck is almost down to my waist, and there are triangles of fabric behind the lace where my breasts will be. Two little buttons will fasten the lace on my back, and other than that, it is a bare back.""

Dad looks disgusted as I describe the dress to him.

He tells me he has a few more things to take care of before we can leave this Pack, but he will make sure it happens in the next few weeks. I tell him he has at least six months until we have to leave.

Weeks pass as I continue working in the kitchen, fitting my so-called dress, and rehearsing the dance.

Today, I have a sinking feeling that something bad is about to happen.

We have to eat in the dining room with the unmated males, and we always have to sit in the same seat. The only thing that changes is the males we sit between during a day.

As I place bowls of fruit on the tables, I realize my fears were right: I'm seated next to the cruelest male in the Pack.

Every female avoids him due to the rumors about his previous two Mates. It's said that he kept them locked up in his cottage, isolated them from their friends and the rest of the Pack.

Rumors also say that he is abusive, both physically and mentally, and that either he killed them or they took their own lives—stories vary with every person who tells them.

I've noticed him glancing at me from time to time, and today I have to sit right next to him for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I hope he'll ignore me like most males do, but I'm afraid I won't be that lucky this time.

Our Alpha instructs us to take our seats, and I reluctantly sit down. As unmated males sit beside me, I keep my eyes on my plate. When the signal is given to start eating, I notice my nightmare placing a bowl of fruit in front of me. I quietly thank him as I take the bowl from his hands.

Neither male speaks to me during breakfast, and I feel relieved when I return to the kitchen. I spend my break in my room, reviewing everything Dad and I discussed over the past two weeks, before heading back to work.

Lunch is similar to breakfast, and as I make my way to the ballroom, I hear our Luna is already present. Over the years, I've learned to distinguish her laughter, and this one signals trouble for whoever is involved.

I stop beside the door, which they left ajar, unsure if they expect me yet, as I usually arrive ten minutes later.

""Does Umayza suspect this is a setup?"" one of the other females asks, and I want to scream, No.

""Of course not. She's as gullible as her Father was when he arrived here. They have no idea he requested the Alpha to put her in the other group, and he'll make sure she never finds out. He'll have his fun with her, but I hope she'll last longer than the others did.

His first Mate disappeared within a year, and his second Mate within two years. But you know, I don't care—he only picks females not born in this Pack,"" Luna responds. I quickly walk away until I am out of hearing range.

My heart races with a surge of dread and revulsion. To feign ignorance, I put on a light expression and start humming as I walk towards the ballroom again.

""Hello, Luna,"" I greet as I walk into the ballroom, only to stop dead in my tracks when I see my so-called dress ready.

""Umayza, today you will rehearse in your outfit,"" Luna says, holding the dress out to me. There's something in her eyes that tells me she's up to something.

Chapter 2 Conviction

Umayza

""Luna, I think there's been a mistake with my measurements. This is way too short,"" I protest after I change into my outfit.

The dress, now altered, barely covers my body. I can't help but worry that a simple turn will expose my panties to everyone.

""No, it's perfect for you,"" Luna says with a cold smile. ""I want to make sure that you find a Mate, and I don't want any of our High-ranking members to pick you. When someone requested you be placed in this group, I convinced my Mate it was for the best. I never wanted your Father or you to join our Pack.""

She states this, and I see there are at least five Warriors present—something that is normally not allowed during rehearsal.

I stare at our Luna as she starts laughing, and I finally realize she actually hates me, for whatever reason that might be.

Without thinking further, I lunge at her, my fist connecting with her nose in a sharp, resounding crack.

Two Warriors immediately seize me, pulling me away before I can do any more harm. One of the High-ranking females steps forward, her gaze icy. ""You've assaulted your Luna, and for that, you will be convicted."" She looks at everyone in the room, and they all agree with her.

The Luna has a smirk on her face as the Warriors drag me down to the dungeons.

An hour later, my Father arrives at the dungeon. There is no worry in his eyes as he says, ""Be patient. Everything will be alright.""

Whenever Dad says that, I know something unexpected is about to happen. It's something his Father taught him, and so far, it always turns out well.

I nod my head as I see my nightmare coming down the stairs.

His eyes move up and down my body, and the look he gives me sends shivers down my spine.

When Dad notices my discomfort, he turns around. ""Stay away from her,"" he growls at the man.

Dad pulls a chair in front of my cell and keeps his eyes on my nightmare. One of the Warriors standing guard grabs a sheet from a shelf and hands it to me through the bars.

I thank him as I wrap the sheet around myself.

We talk about everything that won’t give away that something is going to happen—the latest book I read, the show he watched on TV the other night. We talk about Mom and how much I resemble her. I have her light brown hair and chocolate brown eyes.

About an hour after dinner, our Alpha walks in with two huge males behind him, and I can tell they are Lycans.

Dad gives me a reassuring smile as I look at him. Apparently, this is my ticket out of here, and for some reason, our Alpha is not pleased.

Both males are about 6'3"" with blond hair and blue eyes. Anyone can see that they are twins, and if I had to bet on it, I would say they are High-ranking Lycans.

""Open her cell,"" one of the males says to a Warrior, and our Alpha just nods, though he looks like he wants to object.

""You are charged with assaulting your Luna. The Council has ordered us to bring you to the Academy,"" the same male tells me.

""You can leave the sheet in your cell,"" the other male says, and with some fright in my eyes, I look at Dad.

""Gentlemen, my Daughter was in a fitting session at the time of the attack. I brought her a change of clothes, as I know she won't be comfortable in what she's wearing under that sheet,"" Dad says.

I see both males looking from me to Dad, so I decide to show them what I am wearing.

I turn in such a way that only they can see what is underneath the sheet, and I see anger flashing through their eyes.

They order everyone out and tell Dad to hand me the bag with clothes he brought for me. Then, they all walk out of the dungeons.

Ten minutes later, one of the Lycans walks back in and tells me to follow him.

Dad is waiting outside with the other Lycan. He hugs me as he whispers in my ear that we will meet soon. I kiss him on his cheek before I follow one of the Lycans to a black SUV.

The young female who has been covering my station these past few weeks smiles at me, and I get a feeling that she called in my conviction to the Council. Within seconds, the other Lycan gets behind the wheel.

Just as he turns the ignition on, my nightmare jumps in front of the SUV.

Our Alpha quickly pulls him away, and they start arguing as the SUV passes them. I sigh in relief. I know both males heard it, but they don't say a word as we leave the Pack grounds behind us.

I close my eyes and lean back into the car seat, letting the events of the past day run through my mind.

I have a sinking feeling my nightmare won't give up easily, and I wonder if I should tell the men in the front seats about him.

As my thoughts race, sleep takes over.

Shouting startles me awake. I am very disoriented as I try to figure out what is going on.

""Damn it, Evander! Keep your eyes on the road. I'll see where they're coming from!"" the passenger yells. I glance to my left as I see him looking to the right.

""Left,"" I say, spotting a wolf emerging from the tree line. Evander swerves, barely avoiding the charging wolf.

I recognize the wolf instantly, and a cold certainty settles over me—this won't end until he's dead.

""I know this isn't the time to tell you my life story, but that wolf won't stop until he has me or he's dead,"" I say, my voice tight.

For a moment, the wolf seems to vanish, leaving a strange knot in my stomach. I scan the area, turning my head left and right, trying to spot him again. Up front, the men debate whether to take a detour to shake him off.

""Conri, call Council-member Boaz and ask what we should do about this wolf. Also, tell him he's after the convict we have in the SUV,"" Evander says, glancing at me through the rearview mirror. I keep scanning the surroundings, hoping the wolf doesn't show up again.

""Boaz wants us to head to one of the safe-houses. They'll hold a conference call to hear her story,"" Conri says after ending the call. ""They don't want to wait until she reaches the Academy. After that, they'll decide what to do about the wolf.""

Conri explains that the Council has safe-houses all over the country within the grounds of allied Packs. They plan to take me to the nearest one, where I'll get a chance to tell the Council what happened.

I continue scanning the area, but so far, my nightmare hasn't reappeared. I start to relax a little, though my Father's lessons keep me alert, even after we arrive at the Pack where we'll be staying for a few hours.

Evander drives past the Pack-house, quickly leaving the Pack village behind. He stops in front of a small cottage hidden among tall trees. I realize I would never have found this place on my own if Evander didn't know where to go.

Conri opens the door and extends a hand to help me out. At 5'7"", I feel pretty small standing next to him, and when Evander joins us, I get an irrational urge to run. But without my wolf, I know I wouldn't stand a chance.

It'll take another year before I get my wolf and can shift—maybe then I'll be able to outrun them.

I glance up at both of them and suddenly burst into laughter, realizing I'd never outrun them, even with my wolf.

They both look at me, confused.

""Sorry,"" I chuckle. ""I just realized that even with my wolf, there's no way I'd outrun the two of you.""

Thankfully, they have a sense of humor and laugh along with me.

Chapter 3 Evander

Evander

""Gentlemen, we just received a call from Bright Moon Pack. One of their members was accused and convicted of assaulting their Luna, and we need you to go pick her up. We weren't given many details, but the caller did mention that we needed to act quickly. She sounded pretty fearful, and she told us not to trust the Alpha and Luna about what happened—that we needed to hear her story as well,"" Council-member Boaz says.

Conri and I nod our heads as we get up from our seats, and we waste no time getting to our SUV.

""Evander, any thoughts as to why this person was asking the Council to react fast?"" Conri asks me, and I let the little information we have pass through my mind. It is not much, and I understand why Conri is asking me this question, considering the past.

My mind travels back to another assignment we did for the Council—a young woman had been accused and convicted by the Pack, and a Warrior had called the Council to inform them. When we arrived at the Pack, the Alpha had sworn up and down it had been a misunderstanding, and we contacted the Council on how to proceed.

We were told to head back to the Academy and leave the punishment up to the Alpha, as it had been a minor incident according to him. A month later, a neighboring Pack had contacted the Council that a female had asked for asylum—she was more dead than alive at that time.

When the Council was informed of the circumstances, they had realized it was the female we had been sent for, and Conri and I had been sent back to talk to her. During our conversation, we found out that if we had talked to her that day, we would have taken her with us.

To this day, we regret not talking to her, not saving her, and she made us promise with her dying breath that we would never walk away until we had heard both sides of the story. The Council allowed our Squad Captain Armand and the rest of our team to join us, and we were joined by Investigator Harlyn.

Together, we had managed to find the evidence against the Alpha, Beta, and Gamma. Turns out that the female had been the Alpha's Daughter, but he had never treated her as such, and his Beta and Gamma had taken liberties with her for years.

The Warrior who had called the Council had accused her on purpose—he had hoped to get her out of the situation she was in before it would end her life, and if we hadn't listened to the Alpha, he would have succeeded in rescuing her.

Conri pulls me from my thoughts as he asks again if I have any idea why the Council was asked to act quickly. ""We know it involves a female, and there are a number of reasons why a female would attack a Luna. Most of those reasons are enough to get convicted by the Council as well, so we can assume that it is not a standard reason,"" I say.

I let him think on my words as we drive towards Bright Moon Pack.

By the time we get there, we still haven't narrowed down the answer, and I am afraid we may never find out, as we will not be there when she has to face the Council. Maybe we will get the chance to ask her on the way back.

The Alpha is not too pleased with our presence—he actually looks really uncomfortable—and as we follow him to the dungeons, I hear Conri through our mind-link: ""I think the caller was right; it is a good thing we came this soon."" I believe he is correct in his assumption.

The girl in the cell is gorgeous, and I can see that the male with her is related to her. I see an uncomfortable look on her face after I tell her to leave the sheet behind. Once she realizes we don't understand her concerns, she turns her back on the others and reveals what she is wearing. I quickly understand her discomfort, and I order everyone out as I tell her to get changed.

The girl is wearing a dress that barely covers her, and the top is mostly see-through. I groan inwardly as I take in how she looks. ""Fuck, Evander. What the hell is she wearing? There is no way I will let her walk out of here dressed like that,"" Conri says.

As we are waiting outside, the Alpha orders the Warriors to follow him to the Pack-house. Her Father looks around before he turns to us and hands me a piece of paper. ""Give this to my Daughter once she is safe and the Council gives you permission,"" he says. I peek inside to see a number written down.

I nod my head before I push it into my pocket. Conri walks back into the dungeons after ten minutes to take the girl to our SUV, and I see Pack-members gathering as Conri guides her over to the SUV.

One member looks murderous, while another has a small smile on her face, and I think I just found out who the girl's guardian angel is. But I don't understand why the male looks as if we took his Mate away from him. Unless, of course, she is his underaged Mate—that would explain his expression.

But if she is his Mate, then why didn't he say anything? Or why was he not with her in the dungeon? I only have more questions than answers, and I need to talk to Conri about this. I also need to inform the Council about my thoughts, and I hope they will be able to help her.

The Alpha pulls the idiot out of the way so I can drive off with the girl in the backseat, and as I look in the rearview mirror, she closes her eyes. Within minutes, she is fast asleep. It gives me the chance to tell Conri my thoughts, and he quickly relays everything to the Council through an email.

""What do you think that piece of fabric was about?"" Conri asks me, and I think back on the minuscule, red dress she had been wearing, cursing at Conri for putting that picture back in my head. I thought she had been gorgeous with that sheet wrapped around her, but seeing her in that dress...

I shake my head as if I can get rid of the image that way, and from the corner of my eye, I see that Conri isn't doing much better. The sight of her in that dress affects both of us. We both softly chuckle as we adjust ourselves, and I keep an eye on our passenger.

A movement on the right side of the SUV pulls my attention away from her, and Conri is on high alert as he looks out the window, but there is nothing to see out there. I curse as something flies over the hood of the SUV, and Conri follows whatever it was into the forest.

A moment later, I curse loudly as I pull the steering wheel hard to the left—a wolf jumps out of the way in the nick of time, and a moment later, the wolf is back again. ""A rogue on a suicide mission,"" Conri mumbles as we swerve across the road, trying to avoid the wolf.

Conri is shouting at me to keep my eyes on the road, but he can't watch both sides of the SUV at the same time, and I don't want to ram this SUV into a wolf. ""Left,"" I hear from the backseat, and I manage to avoid him once again, but her next words freeze the blood in my veins.

""He won't give up until he has me or until he is dead."" 

Chapter 4 Conri

Evander

It is a whisper, but it is a very clear whisper, and Conri calls Council-member Boaz at my request. We need to know what we can and can't do when it comes to this idiotic wolf, and we need to keep this girl safe at all costs.

Council-member Boaz orders us to go to the nearest safe-house, and I sigh in relief the moment I start to recognize my surroundings. It won't be long before we are at the cottage. I am glad we have been here before, because now no one knows who we brought with us.

It is a one-story cottage surrounded by tall trees and a whole variety of wildflowers. There are two bedrooms at the back, and that is more than enough to accommodate us tonight. As Conri stands next to her, I realize that she isn't tall, and we both tower over her.

She hasn't lost her sense of humor as she tells us what ran through her mind, and I chuckle as I try to imagine her running away from us. My Lycan starts to chuckle at that image. Conri guides her into the cottage as I grab the bag from the SUV—her Father gave it to me after Conri left us to get her from the dungeon.

My Lycan has been acting strange for the past two days, and he is starting to annoy the hell out of me. Conri told me that his Lycan was no better. Neither of our Lycans are able to tell us why they act the way they do, nor can they explain what it is they are feeling.

Tomorrow will be the first day of the Full Moon, and I have a suspicion our Lycans are hoping to find their Mate. We have been waiting long enough for her. We have been waiting for her for thirty years, and Conri and I are close to giving up hope.

With every year that passes, my Lycan starts to get more depressed, but every time I bring up taking a chosen Mate, he blows up in my face, and it takes days before he talks to me again. Conri's Lycan is the same when it comes to our fated Mate and a chosen Mate.

We sometimes talk about it and have a good laugh at their attitude towards a chosen Mate. Conri's Lycan refused to talk to him for a week when Conri once suggested to me that we each take our own chosen Mate—not that he was being serious.

Rummaging in the kitchen pulls me from my thoughts, and I see Conri in the doorway with his arms crossed in front of his chest.

Conri

After I ask my Brother why he thinks she got convicted, I know where his thoughts are going—the same place and time as mine—and I know why the Council chose us to go get this girl. Not that they don’t trust anyone else to do the job, but because of our past experiences.

The Alpha is waiting for us as we stop in front of the Pack-house, and I can tell by the look on his face he is not pleased to see us—not that Evander or I care about that at all. ""Alpha, we received a call that one of your Pack-members attacked your Luna. We are here to bring her in front of the Council,"" I say.

Before the Alpha gets a chance to say anything, his Luna steps forward. ""She hit me in the face and broke my nose,"" she growls angrily, and the Alpha has no choice but to show us where they are holding the girl. On our way to the dungeons, the Alpha tries to convince us that his Luna was overreacting to Umayza’s attack.

""Alpha, Umayza attacked your Luna and broke her nose. There were witnesses to it, and they convicted her of assault. We will take her to the Council for her sentencing,"" I say—not that the Council will sentence anyone without hearing the full story.

Over the years, I have seen males and females brought in front of the Council, and some of them were actually sentenced for their crimes. But most of them had been relocated or given the chance to get revenge for a wrongful conviction. Not that Packs were informed of what happened to the Pack-members we brought in front of the Council.

Squad-members who are sent to get a convicted member from a Pack usually don’t even find out what they were accused of or what their explanation for their crime was. Sometimes we get to hear the story as we bring them to a new Pack, or we escort them towards the Sanctuary.

We walk down the stairs into the dungeons, through a hallway leading us further into the dungeons, and the Alpha opens a door that leads into a small room with one cell. My eyes get drawn to the female inside the cell—her hair in a messy bun on top of her head, and her chocolate brown eyes don’t reveal anything.

My Lycan growls in my head as she shows us what she is wearing under that sheet. I link Evander to tell him I won’t allow her to walk out of there dressed like that. He orders everyone out of the dungeons to give her time to change into something more comfortable for her.

My mind is on Umayza, and I know her appearance affected Evander as much as it did me when I see him adjusting himself after I had asked what that piece of fabric was about. I had quickly shoved it into her bag when her back was turned to me—I wanted the Council to see what it was she had been wearing at the time.

My Lycan is convinced it has something to do with the attack, and I have to agree with him on that. It was a little too revealing for my taste. I think as long as she was standing still there wouldn’t be a problem, but if she moved, it would have revealed more than any male should be able to see.

From the corner of my eye, I see movement, and my yelling at Evander wakes Umayza up. Her eyes are on the left side of the road as I watch the right side of the road. Once I am certain the wolf is gone, I call Council-member Boaz with the information I have, and once he gives the okay, we head for the nearest safe-house.

Despite the situation, she hasn’t lost her sense of humor, and my Lycan shows me an image of us chasing after her. I guide her into the cottage and show her where her room is, but she is more interested in the kitchen. There are fresh fruits and vegetables in the fridge, and I can smell that the Alpha has recently been here.

Looks like the Council warned him we were on our way, and I am glad he put some provisions into the fridge and cupboards before we got here. Umayza seems at ease as she is putting everything she wants on the counter. I watch her as Evander walks into the cottage, and for a moment, he stops to look at what is going on in the kitchen.

He smiles as he walks towards the back of the house with her bag. ""You might want to get the dress out of there—I took it as evidence for the Council,"" I say through the mind-link, and he growls back at me. I chuckle at him, knowing exactly why he growled at me.

Chapter 5 Safe-house

Conri

I hear water running in the shower, and I wait for Evander to get back to the kitchen before I head for the shower myself. Once I am back, Evander asks her if she wants to eat first or if she wants to shower first. ""Food first,"" she says as she places three plates on the kitchen island and takes the seat across from me.

Evander sits down next to me, and we are enjoying the food she has prepared for us. She asks us if anyone knows that we are here, and Evander tells her that the Alpha does, but that he won’t be coming here, as that is the deal the Council made with him.

""None of the Packs come to the safe-house when it is occupied. The Council doesn’t want them to know who is here, and it is for their own protection. If your Alpha was to call here, no one will be able to tell him if you are here or not,"" I explain, and she tells me that that makes sense to her.

Evander and I tell her to take a shower while we clean up the kitchen. At first, she wants to object, but one look at us and she thanks us before she walks to the back of the house. It doesn’t take us long to clean everything up, and I start making coffee for Evander and myself.

I hear her sniffle the air as she walks towards us, and I ask her if she would like some coffee as well. ""Yeah, might keep me awake long enough to answer the questions from the Council,"" she says, and Evander and I chuckle as we know a meeting can be boring at times.

Evander tells her that normally we don’t hear about the charges or why someone committed the alleged crimes—that we hardly ever hear about what triggered them to do what they did—and that in some cases, we are more than curious to find out.

""Well, looks like today is your lucky day, as you will be here when I have to talk to the Council,"" she says, but she doesn’t sound as if it bothers her that we will be hearing everything as well.

Umayza

It is nine in the evening when Evander sets up a laptop for the conference call with the Council. Unlike I had expected, I feel comfortable with the two males next to me, and I know that they will keep me safe while I am with them. Instead of multiple screens popping up for the conference call, there is only one, and I can see the seven Council-members.

Conri introduces the Council-members to me, and Council-member Dayanah tells me that she will be leading the questioning for this investigation. She asks if I want Conri and Evander to leave the cottage. ""That won’t be necessary—they have seen a part of what I need to tell the Council,"" I answer.

Conri sits down to my left as Evander sits down to my right, and for some reason, I feel completely at ease. I don’t feel the anxiety I would feel as I had during one of the meals back in my Pack. I take a deep breath to calm my nerves, and I decide to start my story with how we came to live in Bright Moon Pack.

""My parents were fated Mates, but my maternal Grandparents didn’t approve of my Father, and my parents left Mom’s Pack to be together. However, they were hunted down by my Grandparents, and by the time they finally caught up with my parents, I had already been born. Not that it stopped them from hunting us down—they didn’t even stop after Mom died while protecting me.

Dad kept running until we reached Bright Moon Pack, and Dad was offered the position of Assassin, as that is his rank. Dad was able to build a normal life for us there. It wasn’t until I turned fourteen that we found out this Pack has a rather strange look on Mates—our Alpha doesn’t allow anyone to accept their fated Mate, and anyone that finds their fated Mate is ordered to reject them.

Every female starts living in the Pack-house at the age of fourteen—no exceptions. The unmated females have to stay inside the Pack-house. We were not allowed to go to our family’s homes, and they were allowed a minimum of contact with us at the Pack-house.""

I feel the males next to me get angrier the more I say, and even the Council-members look angry.

""We have to do all the chores in the Pack-house. We prepare the meals for everyone, and when we have our meals, our stations get covered by mated females. During the meals, we sit in assigned seats, and each day, different unmated males sit on either side of us.

When a female turns seventeen, our Luna takes her to a part of the Pack-house we call the fitting room. Your measurements get taken while our Luna picks out a drawing of your outfit, and from that day on, the female has to attend dance classes.

They teach the female a very sensual dance, which you have to perform in front of all the unmated males six months before you turn eighteen. If a male wants to have you as his chosen Mate, he informs our Alpha. There is a ceremony for the High-ranking males and one for the Warriors.

With my Father being our Pack’s Assassin, I normally would have to perform in front of the High-ranking males. But the Wolf that attacked us asked our Alpha to put me in front of the Warriors, as he has an interest in me. I am not sure if our Alpha wanted to grant his request, but on the day I attacked our Luna, she told me she had convinced her Mate to allow it.

She told me she never wanted my Father or me to join the Pack, and this was her way of getting revenge. They also altered my dress to be a lot shorter than it initially was, and when I asked her about it, she told me how she had helped my nightmare to get me in front of him.""

I didn’t look at anyone as I spoke, and my eyes are still on the floor once I am finished.

""Umayza, you had every right to attack her, and we won’t sentence you for this crime. I will send a team to investigate this Pack, because I want to know why the Luna didn’t want you and your Father in her Pack, and we will put a stop to their way of running their Pack.

Is there any way you can contact your Father?"" Council-member Dayanah asks, and I shake my head as I didn’t have my phone with me.

""Council-member Dayanah, her Father handed me a piece of paper with a phone number on it before we left. He asked me to give it to her once she was safe, and if you would allow me to give it to her,"" Evander says.

Council-member Dayanah tells him to give it to me. I smile as I open the piece of paper and recognize my Father’s handwriting.

Chapter 6 Mate

Evander

That my Lycan and I were fuming was putting it mildly, and I could feel through our bond that my Brother wasn’t doing any better. The Council is quick in telling Umayza she will not be sentenced for attacking her Luna, and she releases a sigh of relief.

I don’t understand why some Lycans or Werewolves can be this depraved. The leaders of Bright Moon Pack are really a fry short of a happy meal, and I want to knock some sense into them. Knowing there will be an investigation makes me feel a little better, but not by much.

Council-member Dayanah asks Umayza what she wants to do, and Umayza tells the Council she wants to train to be an Assassin just like her Father—to help the Council get justice for those who can’t get it themselves.

""Umayza, the Council grants you your request. Please call your Father and ask him to report to the Academy as soon as he can. We can use someone with his experience here,"" Council-member Dayanah says. Soon after that, we say our goodbyes to the Council-members.

Umayza looks exhausted, and Conri asks her if she wants to call her Father tonight or tomorrow when we are on our way to the Academy. She opts for the next day as she is struggling to keep her eyes open. Conri guides her to her bedroom as I get some sodas for Conri and myself.

I am proud of Umayza for telling her story to the Council. I can only imagine what it was like growing up in a Pack like that, and I am glad Conri and I grew up in a Pack that values its members. Before I can let my mind wander to White Crescent Pack, Conri walks back into the room.

""She was asleep before she hit the pillow,"" he says with a smile on his face. ""I am glad we grew up in White Crescent Pack. Alpha Atlas was a good and fair Alpha, and Luna Anthea was so sweet. I know Amarah has some big shoes to fill, but I know she will be an excellent Alpha.""

Before I can reply, Conri’s phone starts ringing. When he sees the caller-ID, he puts it on speaker. ""Captain, to what do we owe this pleasure?"" Conri asks, and Captain Armand tells us he and the rest of our Squad will meet us outside the Pack’s territory.

""Knowing a male is after Umayza made Council-member Boaz contact me to come up with a plan to get her safely to the Academy, and Theron has come up with a solid plan. We need clothes that smell like her to put in our SUVs before we all drive away.

There is a fork in the road miles from the Pack that leads in four different directions, and that is where we will all split up to see if we can get rid of him. We will keep in touch by phone, and hopefully you guys can get Umayza to the Academy without further problems,"" Armand says.

Conri tells him he will take care of the clothes they will need. He walks out of the living room, and after I have agreed on our meeting time, I disconnect the call. I stand in front of the window, staring at nothing in particular as Conri walks back into the room. He tells me that he put her clothes under her sheets.

""I left a set on a chair in her room for her to wear tomorrow, and the rest will be divided over the other SUVs. I really hope this will work—I would hate for that idiot to get his hands on her,"" Conri says. As my Lycan roars in my head, his Lycan roars out loud.

""I am going to give Armand her little red dress,"" he says with a smirk on his face, and I groan as the image of Umayza in that outfit pops into my head. My Lycan has a smirk on his face as he says, ""Something to picture when you have to take care of yourself."" I groan again as I quickly block him.
