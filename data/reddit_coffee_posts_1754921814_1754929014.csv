it lies on the table,
still warm,
still shaped like you.

Then the cold —
it sets in slowly,
a frost creeping
over every untouched thought.

I cut open the day,
find your name in the morning light,
your shadow in my coffee cup,
your breath in the space
between heartbeats.

The cause of death?
You leaving.

The time of death?
Still happening.

1mnh8j1,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/1mnh8j1/aita_dad_makes_a_mistake_and_makes_everyone_else/,AITA - Dad makes a mistake and makes everyone else feel bad because of it.,"I was out the my dad the other day, we stopped to go get coffee. I went into the shop and he stayed in the car. I came back about 10 minutes later and he said a woman had just been screaming at him. From what I gather he was parked and decided to reposition the car by just slightly going forward. Apparently he moved the car forwards and a pair of woman from across the road in a house came out and crossed the road and he didn't see them. He didn't hit them and he said he didn't see them. They started saying he could have gone to jail if he had done etc and they just walked off.

Here's where the issues start, my dad does not take accountant ability for his actions and always blames other people, being I wasn't there to witness what happened I find it hard to tell what my dad says at times the truth based on past history. We then drove home, he was upset by what had happened but also wasn't sure over his actions. He already was making a huge thing out of this and was worried if they were going to go to the police. I tried to reassure him that they wouldn't do and being he didn't hit them it was fine and just a simply mistake and to be more careful in future.

  
Since getting home yesterday he's been in an awful mood, it's like walking on eggshells and he just starts using other things to blame on what happened. He now doesn't want to go back to the coffee shop and it feels like his taking out his mood on both myself and my mother. I always make some drinks at home (my love lanague is acts of service) and he just keeps saying no to it.

In hinge sight I know I was in a pissed mood at home and could have been more supportive but at the same time I know he's stubborn and just doesn't listen to me and he blames everyone else instead of himself.

Should I feel bad that I didn't offer more support or is it him not acting like an adult and accepting he made a mistake without taking it out on others?.",1,1754928688.0,AmItheAsshole,2,1.0,False

**Why This Pick?**

I feel much better about the Detroit Tigers ever since Kerry Carpenter’s return, betting family. Detroit’s last 8 straight wins have all seen them score at least 5 runs, and yes, I do think they bag a victory over the White Sox…especially since it appears as though Chicago will run a bullpen game this evening. To be fair, I don’t love Chris Paddack (4.91 ERA) – and while the White Sox offense is always a wild card, they've been hitting and scoring far better since returning from the All-Star break. Chicago should get more than a few on the board here. Take the Over to cash today, friends.

1mnh4w5,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_GoobygoobyGoose/comments/1mnh4w5/my_last_patient_at_the_mental_hospital/,My Last Patient At The Mental Hospital,"Between 1989 and 1997 I was a shrink at the Great Oaks Mental Hospital, back when Great Oaks was a thriving community before mystery and tragedy turned it into the ghost town it is today. There are plenty of stories that I could share from my time at Great Oaks Mental Hospital but there is one that I will never forget, every detail. I wouldn’t even have to look back on my notes. 

I have changed any pertinent information, names, birthdates, and any other unimportant personal details to avoid breaking HIPAA laws. Not that I’m sure that’s a concern anymore. The patient has been dead for some time and that is probably for the better, if I’m being honest.

He was the last patient I saw at the facility. I’d like to say he wasn’t the reason why I left but I’m not sure that is true. I was used to seeing five to ten patients a week being one of five therapists of varying official titles but by the time I saw this man, we’ll call him Peter, he was my only patient.

The town hadn’t started dying yet but the effects were beginning to blossom at the Mental Hospital. In later years the hospital would be considered ground zero for all the crazy and weird things that would over run the town as a whole. But that is all in due time. For now our focus is Peter. 

Like I said he was my only patient, due to some unfortunate circumstances, unfortunate stories, and even more unfortunate losses families stopped admitting family members to Great Oaks Mental Hospital opting to go to facilities farther away but more “reliable.”

This was one of many conversations we had. They were almost always the same which helps me remember the details even though I would never forget them.
	

“Why don’t you tell me what happened?” I asked him as he sat across from me. The room was bright. Brighter than normal. He requested blinds open and all the lights on. Eventually it wasn’t enough and I had to double the number of lamps in my office. The nurses said he started with a night light, by this time the overhead light in his room was on 24/7.
“Why should I? We’ve done this before. We have the same conversation every week.” He said dejected. He was also correct. This was how we started the last session of every week. It was tedious and repetitive but it was the job. It was also the point in the week that he was most open and most willing to talk about his experience.

“Yes we have talked about it but talking about it will help.” I told him reassuringly. He was an uneasy man, some would say broken, and that was no surprise either. You don’t end up in a mental hospital because you’ve got life figured out.

At least Peter wasn’t. Before becoming a patient at our facility he was a successful lawyer married to a lovely lady, let’s say Sarah, who had planned on being a stay at home mother.

“Talking hasn’t helped. Not with you not with anyone else.” He said not making eye contact. He never made eye contact with me. He stared off into space, mostly at the floor or out the window. Until we got into his story. Every time we got into details he would stare at the corner of my office. “Talking won’t help.” He continued. “Not when no one believes me.”

“Why do you think no one believes you?” I asked. I made sure to keep my opinions as a professional neutral I never gave him any indication that I didn’t believe him. Even though I didn’t, not yet anyway.

“I know when people don’t believe me.” He said matter-o-factly. “You don’t believe me. The last lady didn’t believe me. The grievance counselor I saw before coming here didn’t believe me. I don’t blame you. I know I sound crazy. But what I am saying is true.” His face was still, stern, as if it were carved from stone. Peter wasn’t an emotional man. Not by the time he became my patient.

“Peter.” I said gently but couldn’t pull eye contact. “No one has ever said they don’t believe you. You’re just assuming they don’t-”

“No! I know no one believes me.”

“How? How are you so sure?” I asked quizically. This was the first sign of emotion he had shown me in weeks. Even as a professional I was still a little surprised. He had been a patient for almost three years even though he had only been my patient for about nine months and in those three years he had only been angry twice. His previous therapist had notes on him being sad, scared, remorseful, depressed but never angry. The first time he had shown anger was when a nurse told him he couldn’t leave his lights on and the night light would have to suffice. “How can you be sure?” I prompted again when he didn’t answer.

“He told me.”

The story Peter told me repeatedly was outlandish, unbelievable, and horrifying. It would’ve made for a great campfire story if the man who was telling it didn’t believe it whole heartedly. Even though it was an unbelievable story that he had told to multiple different therapists over years the details stayed the same. Exactly the same. Every set of patient notes used the same wording describing the same experience beat for beat. This is the story as I remember it.

“Hey babe do you remember about two months ago when we went camping?” Sarah asked Peter plopping down on the couch next to him.

“Yes. It was a great time.” He said with a smile setting down the thick file he had been reviewing. 

“Something came back with us.” She said trying her best to hide her smile.

“What do you mean? Like a bug or a possum or something? It’s been two months and you just found it?” He asked shifting uneasily in his seat. He loved the outdoors but wasn’t very fond of the things that lived in the woods they frequently camped in. Sarah was the spider killer of the family.

“Okay, maybe not something.” She said easing him immediately. “But a someone.” She grinned revealing the positive pregnancy tests she had been hiding.

Peter was over joyed. He had been made partner at his law firm the year before and after being married for four years the promotion was all they were waiting for to start trying for kids. It took a little longer than he thought, with the lack of sexual education he had grown up with he figured the first time without birth control would’ve been enough.

“I can’t believe it.” He nearly wept as he kissed her. “This is great!”

Things were as you would expect from expecting parents. Peter painted the nursery and built a crib. Sarah looked through catalogs for baby clothes and toys. The morning sickness was almost non existent but the cravings were in full force. He had caught her eating peanut butter straight from the jar using a pickle spear as a spoon, topped her vanilla ice cream with mild hot sauce, and once half a can of sardines which she was previously disgusted by. Every time he caught her sneaking her special treats he would laugh it off. Happy to see her happy.

“You know they say you can learn the sex of the baby before it’s born these days.” Peter’s grandmother said one day early in the third trimester. “Wouldn’t that be fun.” She smiled sweetly as she looked out of the window of her nursing home.

“I think it might be fun to keep it a surprise.” Peter said refilling his grandmother’s tea. They loved spending time with her, Peter wanted to move her in with them but their starter home was too small and was about to get smaller.

“Oh come on Peter, wouldn’t it be cool to know? Be able to prepare?” Sarah asked excitedly. Peter really did want to wait. Even though he wouldn’t admit it out loud he wanted a boy and finding out early that he would get a girl might be disappointing.

“We can ask the doctor at the next appointment.” Peter said with a smile.


-


“Any more questions?” Their doctor asked as the appointment was finishing up. Everything checked out, a healthy baby and healthy mother made for a happy father.

“Just one.” Sarah said as she sat up. “We were wondering about a test to check the sex of the baby.” She said grinning with excitement.

“Ah yes.” The doctor said as he made a final note in the records he was keeping. “That is becoming more common these days. More reliable too. Seems that expecting parents are too excited to wait. ‘Specially first timers.” The old man explained sitting back down in his rolling stool.

“Is it complicated? Any concerns?” Peter asked. He was always the realist of the two.

“No, no. It’s perfectly safe. A simple blood test. I can do a draw now and send it out to the lab. You would have results in a week or two. I’ll have them mailed to your house. That way if you change your mind, just don’t open the envelope.” His voice was deep and soothing it gave them comfort. “The only hitch would be that it isn’t covered by insurance. Not yet anyway. I’m sure the test will be in the future as it becomes more common but right now you would have to pay out of pocket. About three hundred dollars.” 

Sarah gave Peter a puppy-dogged look that she knew would melt his heart. “Let’s do it.” He said knowing he wouldn’t be able to say no.

A week later the results showed up in their mail box. Excitedly Sarah pulled the envelope from the mailbox and left it perched on the kitchen table for when Peter got home. 

“Ready?” He asked after dinner still sitting at the table.

“I don’t know. I’m nervous.” She explained but he thought she looked more giddy than nervous.

“We can wait. How’s another four months sound?” Peter joked as he slid the envelope to her. “I’ll let you do the honors.”

She snatched up the envelope and ripped the edge open without hesitation. She looked at Peter and withdrew the page inside with slow suspense. She cleared her throat unfolding the paper. Then her face dropped.

“This can’t be right.” She said it so quietly that he had a hard time hearing her.

“What’s wrong?” Peter asked with a concerned look.

“It’s… It’s…”

“A boy?” He asked to no response, not that he gave her much time to respond before asking. “A girl?”
	
“It’s blank.” She said said still staring at the paper.

“Like the test didn’t work?”

“No like the whole paper is blank.” She said turning it to him revealing nothing but blank white space.

“Weird.” He said surprised to hear the disappointment in his voice. “We have another appointment next week we can ask the doctor for the results then. I’m sure the results were sent to them too.” He said comforting her. She was disappointed but agreed.

-


“Everything still checks out. Right as rain.” The doctor said washing his hands.

“That’s great news. I’ve been worried since we got the results from our test.” Sarah said knowing that this would news to both the doctor and her husband.

“Why was there something concerning about the sex of the baby?” The doctor asked turning his attention towards her. 

“It’s nothing. They just mailed us a blank piece of paper.” She explained trying to hold back tears.

“We were hoping you’d have the results. Maybe it was an error when they were mailing it to us.” Peter interjected.

“Yes. They sent the results here as well. One of the office lady’s would’ve added it to your file. I haven’t had a chance to look for myself but I should be able to find it here.” He said as he started to shuffle through the folder. “Hmh. Seems the results were inconclusive. That happens from time to time nothing to worry about. The tests have become more reliable but that doesn’t mean they are guaranteed.”

After a few days the melancholy of the undetermined results had passed and things were back to normal better than normal, Sarah was over the moon that morning when she felt the baby kick. They had thought the baby had kicked before but never like this.

“Feel this baby!” She squealed pushing her belly towards him as he poured his cup of coffee. He put a hand to her stomach and felt kicks, several of them, very hard. There was no doubt this time the baby was active.

“Whoa quite a kick there kid.” He said to her bloated belly. “We could have a running back on our hands.” He smiled up at her.

“Babe.” She laughed back at him.

“Or at least a kicker. Someone’s going to have to take care of us when were old and if he makes it to the NFL that would be no problem.” Peter said jokingly.

“It could still be a girl.” Sarah reminded him. She had become okay with waiting to find out the gender. Actually she was excited by the surprise.

-

The day of the labor started out like any other, Sarah stayed home feet up knowing the baby would come any day if not any minute. Peter went to work already alerting his bosses that he might have to leave at a moments notice.

He didn’t have to though, to his surprise, he made it home in time for dinner before the labor started. They rushed out the door and he almost forgot their go bag.

“I got it.” He huffed as he plopped back down into the drivers seat.

“Good let’s gooooo.” Sarah squealed.

The drive was quick and they were prepping for birth before they knew it. The birth wouldn’t come quickly though they spent hours sitting in the quiet room Sarah fighting through contractions and Peter their holding her hand the whole time.

“Let’s play ball.” The doctor said taking his position between Sarah’s legs. Peter couldn’t help but think he looked like a catcher behind home plate.

Sarah screamed as the delivery began and Peter could only assume that was normal. 

“Good, Good. Keep pushing, Sarah.” The doctor said calmly from his position. 

The calm nature of the doctor didn’t ease Peter’s worry as Sarah’s scream grew louder her squeeze on his hand tighter. In fact the relaxed nature of the doctor unsettled him as the doctor spoke. Now Peter couldn’t hear what the man was saying over his wife’s screaming. Her cries for help, begging to be released from the pain. 

This wasn’t right. He knew this wasn’t right. There was no way this was how delivering a baby worked. She was too panicked, in too much pain even for having a baby. The doctor was too calm. 

“Sir, we need to clear the area.” One of the nurses said leading him away from his wife.

“Wha-what?” He said confused. “No. What’s happening? I’m not going anywhere.” But his pleas were ignored and the nurse shuffled him to the corner of the room. Then everything went quiet. He wasn’t sure how long he was left in the silence while the medical staff worked behind the curtain that was pulled closed.

“Congratulations you sir have a nice healthy boy.” The doctor said when he emerged from behind the curtain. He held a rather large baby wrapped into a tight bundle. “Would you like to hold him?” He said holding the baby out to Peter.

“Yes. How’s Sarah doing? Can I see her?” He asked reaching for his child.

“She did good. She’s sedated and sleeping now. The boy was big so it was a little more complicated but everything is fine now.” He said in his usual demeanor that set Peter mind to rest. He took his son from the doctor and looked into his boys face for the first time.

“What the hell is this?” He barked. What was staring back at him wasn’t staring at all. I was a stark white, smooth, featureless face. “This isn’t a child.” He barked but when he looked up there was no one there. No doctor, no nurses, not even his wife. He was alone in their room with this thing. 

He dropped the baby and backed away from it. When he did so the bundle wrapped around the baby fell loose. The baby landed on his hands and feet. Or rather his hands and hooves because from the waist down the baby closer resembled the ass end of a donkey while the top half was white as snow and smooth as butter.

The baby-thing scuttered across the room then turned to look at him. This time it did actually look at him. It struggled at first but after a few test blinks the baby-things skin tore free with a sickly ripping sound that made Peter’s blood run cold. It made indistinguishable guttural throat noises at him as if it was trying to talk to him.

Peter wanted to run for the door every bit of his instinct was urging him to leave the room but he couldn’t take his eyes off of it. Then as quickly as it settled in his hypnotic state broke and he burst through the door leaving the thing all alone.

-

“And that’s exactly how you remember it?” I would ask him when his recounting was over.

“Yes. I’m not lying.”

“No one has accused you of lying.” I would remind him.

“No but no one would if they thought so.” He countered never skipping a beat.

“Would you?” I asked him at our last session. I had decided that session that this would be my last day. Not only at the hospital but in the career. Therapists often partake in therapy themselves I was never one of those therapists. Maybe I should have been. Maybe it would have kept me in the job longer but knowing what came after this session its probably for the best that I didn’t. So I was at the end of my rope. Burnt out and ready to move on. It might be unprofessional but it left me the opportunity to be completely open, upfront, and honest. I could finally start digging without having my hands tied behind my back.

“Would I?” He repeated finally making eye contact.

“Would you think that you were lying? Would you believe your story if someone else told it to you?”

He thought for a second. “Now I would. But I’m biased.”

“And you don’t think that these memories, the way you think it happened, are a coping mechanism for what really happened?” I asked loosening up a bit.

“That is what really happened.” He retorted. Now he wasn’t breaking eye contact and I missed all those hours of him staring at the floor.

“No.” I said bluntly. “What really happened.” I paused I knew none of this was new information to him but it was the touchiest of subjects. “What really happened was the child birth was very complicated. Too complicated.” I softened my tone. “Sarah died while giving birth and shortly after that so did your child. Peter, you lost your family in the matter of minutes. That’s very traumatizing and people react to trauma in strange ways.” 

“I was there. I know what happened. I saw that demon for myself. I never saw my wife again. They took her. Because of what she birthed.”

“Peter that isn’t true.” 

“Yes it is!” He screamed before storming out of the room.

I stayed for a while after that. I finished my patient notes, packed my things, and wrote my resignation letter. I slipped it under my bosses door when I left for my lunch break knowing I would never be back.

It wasn’t long after that I decided to pack my bags and move out of Great Oaks entirely. I didn’t go far just a few towns away. I ran into an old co-worker after the town started what would be its inevitable collapse. That was another conversation I won’t forget.

After the niceties were done she leaned close to me. “Did you hear what happened to Peter?” She asked in a hushed tone.

“Peter? No I haven’t heard anything.” I was surprised she was bringing him up. I hadn’t thought about Peter for a few years. Now I think about him every day. “What happened?”

“He hung himself from his shower rod.” She whispered.

“What? When?” I asked in complete shock. He had never shown signs of suicidal tendencies. As far as the patients at Great Oaks Mental Hospital Peter was lucid and logical, which was better than most. His problems were believed to be paranoia and hallucinations potentially schizophrenic.

“1999. June, I think.” Then she asked me a question I wasn’t expecting. “Remember his story?” 

“Who could forget it?” I said with more sarcasm than I would’ve liked. I should’ve guessed that this lady had picked him up as a patient when I left. There were only two therapists left.

“Did he tell you about the thing in the room?”

“When his wife died? Yes of course.”

“No I mean during sessions.” She explained.

“I’m not sure what you mean.” I said genuinely confused.

“He told me during his sessions, whenever he got into the details of that night, the demon baby thing was in the room with us.”

“What?” I asked more as an involuntary reaction than anything else.

“Yeah he said it would sit in the corner of the room just listening before it waived a disappeared.”

I feel like I’ve tried almost everything…,"Hi all! Sorry for another variant of, “how do I break into publishing?” I just feel like I’ve hit a wall and have truly exhausted all the advice I’ve been given over the years.

I’ve been told to make use of the fact that I work in a prestigious performing arts institution in NYC and network around the area since I’m in close proximity to the big 5. I’ve set up coffee chats and informational calls with publishing VPs that have gone well (I think) and they assured me it’s doable as there are transferable skills between industries. So I’ve tried to highlight such skills in my resume and applications, but that never seems enough as I don’t have publishing-specific experience. 

I’ve looked into the Columbia Publishing Course but don’t have the funds or time for it right now as I currently work a full-time job. I’m more than happy to take any other asynchronous publishing course in my free time but I don’t know which ones would truly be helpful. 

I saw that PRH recently hosted a Publishing Pathways Program for mid-level professionals looking to make a career switch, which is EXACTLY what I need. Sadly, I didn’t make the cut having only worked for 4 years. And I doubt I would’ve made the cut either way. I’ve only ever held 1 job which is my current role in performing arts operations. 

I’ve applied to hundreds of jobs outside of the big 5, messaged hundreds of professionals on LinkedIn, and tweaked my resume according to keywords every time, but nothing hits. 

It also doesn’t help that my salary has advanced over the years, so transitioning to an entry-level publishing internship or assistant position would be at least a 30k decrease in salary. I mean, I’m so desperate to get into publishing I might take that, but is going backwards really the ONLY way to pivot?

I think I’m just not sure how to bridge the gap between wanting to work in publishing and knowing what exactly in publishing I need to work towards and how. I love project management and operations, but that’s so general. I don’t know what role that would equate to. My parents worked in the big 5 (retired decades ago) so it has always been a dream of mine, but I feel like I’m stuck in performing arts forever. 

Any advice appreciated. I’m willing to put in the work, I just don’t know what the work is! 😅",1,1754928410.0,publishing,0,1.0,False
1mnh3l5,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuiltToTest/comments/1mnh3l5/explore_the_best_electric_kettle_oxo_brew_and_is/,Explore the Best Electric Kettle OXO Brew and Is It Worth It,"Using the OXO 8716900 adjustable temperature kettle daily has been quite an experience, and not just because I drink tea by the gallon. This is more than a kettle; it’s a precision tool for caffeine addicts and perennial tea-drinkers like me. With features like adjustable temperature settings and a sleek borosilicate glass build, it fits perfectly into both my kitchen and my routine. That said, I’ve noticed nuances that might sway someone depending on their specific needs. 

**Design and Build Quality That Stands Out**

The design is as clean and modern as it gets. The combination of stainless steel accents and durable borosilicate glass gives the kettle a premium look, but it’s more than just aesthetics. The glass construction isn’t just for show — it offers excellent thermal shock protection, and being BPA-free makes me feel better about the water quality. The silicone base and the comfortable, non-slip handle are thoughtful touches; they make handling this thing a breeze, even as it boils water to scalding levels. That said, the kettle’s height of 13.5 inches might pose a challenge for compact kitchens or weirdly shaped cabinets. 

**Ease of Use with Precise Temperature Control**

I’m someone who likes their green tea at exactly 175°F and coffee at a hotter 200°F, so the adjustable temperature control was like a dream come true for me. The one-dial interface is easy to use, and the backlit screen helps when I’m groggy or making tea late at night. The fact that it can hold my selected temperature for up to 30 minutes is a game changer. It allows me to pour out another cup without waiting for the water to heat up again. Plus, the Celsius and Fahrenheit options are helpful for recipes or teas that specify a particular metric. The only hiccup? The dial can be slightly sensitive, so occasionally, I overshoot my intended setting. 

[Check OXO 8716900 price on Amazon.](https://vendm.com/p/b01ktrdknw/)

**Performance: Faster and Safer Than the Stovetop**

Heating water is this kettle’s bread and butter, and it delivers like a pro. It’s faster than my microwave and feels way safer than boiling on a stovetop. The 360-degree swivel base adds to its convenience, especially when I’m juggling multiple tasks in the kitchen. I particularly liked the ounce and milliliter markings inside; they reduced the guesswork for precision cooking or specific tea requirements. However, if you’ve got bigger hands, removing the perforated stainless steel filter for cleaning might feel a bit fiddly. 

**Comfort Features Worth Noting**

The lid opens slowly—a small feature that makes a world of difference. Steam doesn’t rush out in a dangerous plume, which means fewer burns or spills. The non-slip handle also stays cool no matter how hot things get inside the kettle. I never thought I’d appreciate a handle this much, but here we are. These little touches really make daily usage smoother, especially if you’re someone who’s still sleepy when boiling water in the morning.

**Key Benefits**

- Borosilicate glass design is BPA-free and offers thermal-shock protection.  
- Adjustable temperature control ensures your beverages are always the perfect temperature.  
- The backlit screen and simple interface are functional and easy to use.  
- Thirty-minute heat retention is a major convenience.  

**Flaws to Watch Out For**

Even though I enjoy this appliance daily, it’s not without its quirks. 

- The dial is somewhat overly sensitive, potentially skipping over the desired temperature.  
- Its height might make storage tricky for those with smaller or crowded kitchens.  
- Cleaning the removable stainless steel filter can be slightly cumbersome for some users.  

**Competing Products**

When comparing this adjustable kettle with brands like Cuisinart or Breville, the OXO model holds its ground well. Breville, for instance, offers kettles with a similar design and fancier pre-set temperature buttons, but those tend to be pricier and bulkier. On the other hand, Cuisinart kettles often miss the sleek borosilicate glass that the OXO kettle flaunts. While the OXO stands out for its clean, durable build and straightforward design, others might offer more presets or larger capacity. You’ll need to weigh whether precise knob control or a variety of automated buttons suits your lifestyle better. 

**Cost-Effectiveness**

When judging its price against the features, I’d say this kettle is worth it for anyone who values precision and aesthetic design in their kitchen appliances. Its durability and the ability to customize water temperature make it a top-tier choice for tea enthusiasts, coffee aficionados, or anyone just tired of guessing when the water’s hot enough. While not the most budget-friendly option, it delivers excellent value for those who aim to get their money's worth.

1mnh1iy,https://www.reddit.com/r/howyoudoin/comments/1mnh1iy/on_phoebe/,on phoebe,"phoebe lowkey bothers the crap out of me. if you dont want to read another ""I hate phoebe"" post then get over yourself and show yourself out. im not here to write what you want to hear, im here to write what you need to hear. besides, the other Phoebe hate posts just aren't quite getting it. I need to clear the air on this woman and show you all that she is really, really, not a good character, both in terms of being a bad friend and also being pretty dumb.

we all think of joey as the dumb one, and that's for good reason, but Phoebe is lowkey stupid as well. you might point to her argument with ross about evolution, but that could just be attributed to her weird ass hippie anti-establishment belief system (she was a reddit contrarian before reddit). or you might call her dumb for keeping rats and mice in her apartment, but that could just be attributed to her loving and caring spirit and concern for animal welfare. see, you can always attribute individual instances of bad things to something else, but when they start to add up, they paint a pretty clear picture.

even if you don't agree with that, there are examples of Phoebe being low iq (or having an extreme lack of knowledge) that can't be blamed on anything other than stupidity. saying ""four o wonk"" is something you might expect joey to do with how utterly stupid it is. or how about the time she believed chandler works with robots? or how about her not picking up on the sarcasm when the elephant told Monica ""good luck"" marrying chandler? or how about when she clearly still believed Santa is real, and joey of all people revealed the truth to her? or how about when she couldn't grasp the basic concept of there being no ""selfless good deed,"" or when she thought she needed to tell Monica who she really was at the halloween costume party?

yeah, Phoebe is dumb. go ahead and tell me how wrong I am, and that she's just quirky or wasn't raised in a conventional manner. I really, really don't care. the fact is, it doesn't really matter the reason for her lack of a brain, im just saying it's an indisputable feature in the show. and maybe you'll point to moments where she seems smart, like her ability to speak French. sorry, but even joey had moments of surprising lucidity. that doesn't mean he was smart, and neither does it mean that for ""phoebs,"" who, by the way, didn't even know that was shorthand for her own name. what the hell.

a nice segue into her bad character while still talking about her intelligence is the episode with her ""mom,"" aka a little kid's cat. I don't know what's worse, her absolute stupidity in believing that dumb cat was her mother, or her insistence on keeping it while knowing that a small child had lost it. and also, you wanna know why the friends really didn't stand up to her (except for ross, who is highly underrated)? because they're afraid to cross her, because her temper is out of control and she almost always resorts to some kind of cartoonish violence when she wants to get her way. you can take the mugger off the streets but you can't take the streets out of the mugger.

maybe if you aren't convinced, you should rewatch the show and see if you can count the number of times Phoebe is rude or dismissive to chandler or ross. or when she bring's rats to Rachel's party and leaves them in a box next to the presents. or when she demands a refund for her donation to needy children and then guilt trips the employee about her stupid rough childhood. or when she sets Rachel up on a date with a pervert for a dumb plan that obviously wouldn't work. or when she constantly accepts praise and flattery by agreeing with the person giving it rather than thanking them or showing humility. or when she lies about never being a maid of honor so she can beat Rachel (who was obviously the right choice, which Monica im sure knew, but again she probably didn't want to cross the violent and temperamental stoner) or when she makes a sexual advance on one of her massage clients, or when she either hides a roommate from her close friends (or lies about it, which might be even weirder), or when she gaslights them about spending too much time at the coffee house or whatever.

yeah, Phoebe is a terrible person in addition to being a complete idiot. I wish I had a better memory because I could probably list a million other reasons. maybe one day I will write a comprehensive report on phoebe's character with proper citations and an indexed list of every single example of her poor moral compass and character. if you add them all up, they would dwarf any of the other friend's flaws. make excuses for her all you want, and tell me its because she was raised by awful parents. fair enough. but lets just be honest and admit that Phoebe budumb sucks.

1mnh0vb,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1mnh0vb/i_think_i_married_a_manchild/,I think I married a man-child,"My husband and I have two children. We have a 3200 sq foot house with a front yard and backyard. The following is an outline of an average week in my life. My husband has a passive income that is starting to shrink.  He works 1 to 2 hours a day, and is currently studying for a state test to be licensed for a new career. He wakes up around 5:30, gets coffee, and locks himself in his office. He is usually watching you tube videos on working out, or porn. Meanwhile, I make the bed, take care of the cat, water the plants, unload the dishwasher, vacuum the floors, and get laundry going. When the kids get up (preschool and elementary age) I help them brush their teeth, shower, dressed, and make their bed. Their dad comes out and makes them breakfast, then promptly goes back into his office to eat his breakfast with his computer. It is currently summer break so after breakfast I get the kids out the door so my husband can have some peace and quiet to work and study. We usually come home around 3pm, and my husband will already be gone most days. Monday, Wednesday, and Friday he goes to the gym in the evenings and makes it home just in time to say good night when they kids are already in bed. Tuesdays and Thursdays he goes to a marital arts class and doesn't come home until after the kids are asleep. Saturday mornings he wakes up and leaves around the time the kids are waking up. He goes to another MA class and usually isn't home and present until about 1:30. After that most Saturdays are still me doing most of the parenting. Sunday is about the only day he really spends time with the kids, but I am still the primary parent. If the kids go near him while he is working on a project of cooking he shoos them away and tells them to come to me. The problem is he is working on projects for himself almost ALL the time. Days go by without him spending any quality time with the kids, or maybe he spends 10 minutes sitting next to them while he is on his phone. He just doesn't give them a lot of love and attention. If they come near him in the kitchen he yells at them. The kids are starting to have an anxious attachment style, and I am worried that their dad doesn't understand what his lack of parenting is doing. 

As far as the house and yard work goes, I have almost no help. My retired, widowed, neighbor comes over and mows my lawn because my husband won't help me with it. The last time this 70 year old man came to mow our yard my husband was just playing with toys in the garage. My husband has also never shown any appreciation, thank you card, or gesture to repay this mans kindness. Here is the short list of things my husband does around the house, and if you are a homeowner you will know how extreme this is. My husband will cook himself dinner, and share it with the family if it's something everyone wants, but a lot of them time we don't want what he made. He will then so some cleaning afterwards. At the least he will get the dishwasher going, but he leaves trash and spills on the counter and never sweeps the floor. He will take the trash bins from our house to the road, but he doesn't bring the bins back in a timely manner. Our HOA requires that the bins be removed off the street within 24 hours of pickup. Our bins will sit there for days, so sometimes I just take on the task of bringing them back. And that's it folks. That is the work he does for our house maintenance. 

Now I am writing to you kind internet strangers because I feel like a crazy person. I admittedly feel like a bang maid and I think I am only valued for sex and labor. The last 48 hours has really proved this to me, and I feel like I am being gaslit by a man-child who just refuses to see how immature he is. On Saturday night my two kids spent the night at my mothers house for the first time. I had taken a bath, had some wine, and was trying to chat and connect with my husband. I was the only one even trying to connect. He just stared at the floor and looked miserable. I called him out on it and he said he just didn't' have anything to say to me. That because I don't want to just hear him rant about his hobbies apparently there is nothing left to say between us. He didn't even ask about my day. He asks me nothing about himself. A good conversation to him is him mansplaining his hobbies while having an audience. So after he said he had nothing to say, he looked at the clock and said ""it's 9pm and we aren't even having sex yet"". I just started to cry and went upstairs, 20 minutes later he knocked on my office door and asked if I wanted to watch TV. It feels sadistic to relay the message that he has nothing to say to me, only wants sex, watches me cry, doesn't apologize, and just asks me to watch TV like nothing happened. Now it is Monday. I woke up, did my chores, and noticed my husband just left his trash on the kitchen counter, Two empty food bins that should have been recycled were just sitting on the counter 4 steps away from the bins. Because both of my children are leaving trash everywhere, and because my husband does the same, I am starting to feel like a constant maid. So this morning I asked him to come out of his office and please dispose of his trash. I asked really nicely, and calmly. I explained I am going to do this to everyone in the house because I refuse to live with trash everywhere, and yet I also refuse to be the house maid. He became irate, and yelled at me. He claimed I treat him like a child. I calmly told him the truth. I told him by not picking up after himself and by doing the bare minimum (if you can even call it that) for the house he IS acting like a child. He kept yelling. I just looked at him and said, if you want to get laid by me or any woman for that matter than I suggest you start learning how to clean up after yourself. 

Lastly, you may want to suggest we hire someone to help with the cleaning. We actually did, and had to let them go almost 3 months ago because we could no longer afford it with the rise of costs in the US. All I asked of my husband is that he take over cleaning his bathroom (which is our guest bathroom too), and to wipe the down the stove since he loves to cook everything homemade, and most of the mess is his. He has cleaned his bathroom once and the stove once. AND I had to ask him to do it. 

I am 100% certain I married a man child who wants a bang maid. My husband gets so mad when I say this.  But he keeps telling me I am wrong. 

This isn't what marriage is supposed to be, is it? Did I marry a man-child?

1mngya5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nova/comments/1mngya5/lpt_for_fairfax_county_for_this_weekend_and/,LPT for Fairfax County for this weekend and August 18th,"Schools in Fairfax County start on Monday, August 18th. 

If you don’t have school aged kids, you are probably not aware of this. So you need to be prepared for the changes. These changes happen every year, after the lull of summer traffic and retail, but if you don’t have kids, you need to just be prepared for it to keep your sanity. 

1) Avoid shopping in stores if you can this weekend. I recommend any kind of curbside pickup or delivery to avoid the parking lot and cash register chaos. Friday should be busy but mostly ok. Saturday will be busy and angry. Sunday will be frazzled and zombie like. If you need office supplies it’s a good time to stock up during the week. It’s not as bad as Black Friday but it can throw people off guard.

2) There will be an uptick in takeout orders. Pizza deliveries in particular will be busy. Be patient.  Restaurants can get swamped too but Sunday can be quiet in restaurants after 7pm. 

3) Monday morning will be even worse than it has been for the past three months as school busses return *and* metal detectors get enforced at schools in Fairfax County (this is new).  Be prepared for hurried driving and more stressed drivers than usual. I would tack on a little extra time as people get used to their modified schedules. 

4) Busses start running again on Monday. If they are stopped with the stop sign- YOU CANNOT PASS THEM. I think they have cameras now, but this is just a reminder to not pass a stopped school bus with their flashers on. I know you want to. I know it’s annoying. 

It’s not worth it. 

5) Starbucks and other coffee places will see an uptick around 8:30-10am on Monday, as parents get their first taste of fall. Be kind. We are experiencing a gamut of emotions and stress. 

If you have any thing else to add, feel free to. This is something I was just thinking about as a mom and as someone who in general watches people’s behavior in the wild fascination. I hope it’s helpful and somewhat humorous.

Suddenly at coffee, she couldnt stop telling her toddler how much she loved him and what joy he brought to her life. I am sure that is all true, but she wasnt sharing an earnest moment with me. Instead she kept stopping mid-conversation to tell the toddler — in loud baby voice — how special and lovable he was. Then we got outside and she threw him up in the air a bunch and blew raspberries on his midsection. I felt like i was the third wheel on a date. It all seemed so performative.

My husband, Atlas Volkan, froze at the door. He unhooked his arm from my sister’s and marched forward. 

I forgot how to breathe as he approached me, the scent of his cologne invading my nose like an addiction. 

How do you love someone to the point of loathing yourself? 

“I have always chosen her.” His words stabbed me in the chest. Turning the dagger, he continued. “Today is her big day and if you love me, don’t ruin it.” 

Atlas turned to leave and I blurted. “You are my husband. We are married, Atlas!” 

“Enough, Julia!” Lovie snapped, glaring at me “Your marriage is a sham. Atlas loves me and you know this,” 

“I have a bad feeling, Atlas.” I begged, “Let me come. I’m scared Atlas.” 

Atlas’ gaze rested on me, almost as if he was worried, but the flicker in his eyes vanished as Lovie spoke. 

“Choose, Atlas. Her or me?” She asked. Like that, the fog cleared and he grabbed her wrist, leaving the house. 

The sound of the keys inside the lock rang through the room. They left and locked me inside. 

I walked over to the closest window, watching as they drove out. My husband and my older sister — the perfect affair. 

My heart ached, my body trembled with sobs. This was my life and I hated it. 

I prepared coffee to clear my mind and I barely took a sip when the banging came minutes later. I stumbled, wide-eyed as the door handle shook. 

Someone… someone was trying to break in! 

I bolted in the opposite direction, tripping over my feet as the door fell off its hinges. 

My stomach twisted into knots as we made eye contact. The man in front of me looked taller, stronger, and masked. 

He reached for me but I scrambled to my feet. 

I flailed my hands and kicked my feet, barely able to hear anything over the sound of heavy pants escaping my lips. I froze as something grazed my skin, pain shooting through my torso. 

My hands dug into my jean pockets and I speed dialed Atlas. He was the only contact I had. 

The only one I trusted. 

He didn’t pick up. 

I kicked the man between his legs and raced up the stairs. I struggled to breathe as I continued calling Atlas. 

Pick up. Pick up! Pick— 

An inhuman screech escaped my lips as the man grabbed my hair, pulling me. My back collided with the wall and I was face to face with his masked face. 

Before I could process anything, his hands found their way to my neck — squeezing life out of me. 

My eyes threatened to pop from their sockets as a soft whimper escaped my lips. Why was he trying to kill me? 

In my life, I sacrificed everything for everyone. I did everything to be loved — wanted, to be seen. 

But nothing worked and now, I was dying. 

I was about to be killed by a stranger in my home, while my husband of three years was at my fashion show, parading with his lover. I was going to die alone, bleeding and gasping for air. 

Was this the reward for being a good person? 

I spat in the masked man’s face and he let out a disgusted grunt. I took the chance to enter my room and lock the door. 

I dialed Atlas, again and again. My knees threatened to buckle as I registered the number of times I had called. 

Fifty-seven. 

My chest tightened as I glanced at the door, which threatened to pop off its hinges. 

He was going to break that door soon, and Atlas hadn’t answered. 

I called one last time, a soft gasp escaped my lips as his voice broke through. 

“Atlas!” 

“What is wrong with you, Julia? Why are you determined to make your sister unhappy?” 

“Someone is trying to kill me, Atlas!” I cried, my grip on the phone tightening. “They are about to break into the room, At—” 

“You will do anything to get my attention, won’t you?” 

“Just shut up and listen for once, Atlas. A man wants to kill your wife! Is Lovie the only one you—” 

The door broke down and a shiver ran down my spine as the man stepped forward, a sadistic grin on his face. 

“Why are you running?” he whispered, “I am setting you free, Julia.” 

I stumbled, my heart falling into my stomach as I applied pressure to my torso. “Stay away! Don’t come close!” I threw all the objects in the room at him, begging for him to leave. 

He didn’t budge. 

My back hit the wall and my knees buckled as I registered blood on my hands. The adrenaline washed off as Atlas’ voice reached me again. 

“Yes, Lovie. That dress looks amazing on you.” 

“I called Sylvia and she assured me everything was fine. Was Julia lying again?” Lovie’s sickeningly sweet voice followed. 

My grip on the phone finally loosened, my life slipping from my grasp. As my body slacked against the wall, the fight for my life, died. 

As the man lunged at me, his hands tracing my neck and squeezing — I didn’t call Atlas. 

I couldn’t. 

All my life… I had to prove myself, to fight for my place… 

Why did I think it would be different with Atlas Volkan? In the end, he only saw me as his brother’s murderer. 

His priorities and love lay with Lovie, the one he was supposed to marry. I was the mistake he could not avoid. 

The night before their wedding, I was kidnapped but escaped into his mansion, hiding in the first room I saw, drugged and barely breathing. 

Atlas was in that room. 

So, when we woke up to cameras and whispers — Everything changed. Rumors spread and I was forced to marry Atlas Volkan to avoid a scandal. Despite the bitterness between us, I did nothing but love Atlas Volkan. 

I was the perfect wife and he was the nonexistent husband, the one who followed my sister’s skirt and never found his way back. 

As the man’s grip on my neck tightened, a tear rolled down my cheek and life left me, slowly. 

I sacrificed everything to earn his love and the one time I needed him — Atlas Volkan was nowhere to be found. 

A final gasp escaped my lips and my eyes widened, my body jerking as I died a slow, cruel death. 

As my vision blurred, my chest tightened. I lived my life for everyone but myself. If I was given a second chance… 

I would not be my mother’s obedient daughter, my sister’s slave, and most definitely not Atlas’ Volkan’s submissive wife. 

I would live for myself and walk away from everyone who never let me truly live. 

As if my pleas were answered — my eyes shot open.

  
I jolted upright, scanning my surroundings. I was back in my room. The door… was intact. The floor wasn’t littered. No vases, no objects thrown about — nothing. 

Not even blood and no masked man strangling me. 

I traced my neck and torso. There was no sign of a struggle or even a scratch. 

Don’t tell me… I’ve been reborn! 

I scrambled to my feet, my hands tracing my body in the mirror. Fate heard my pleas, I get to live again. 

“All you you humiliated me,” I whispered, “Now, it’s my turn.” My gaze shifted to the door as loud knocks filled the room. 

Steeling my nerves, I walked over to the door and opened it, hiding behind it. As the person stepped in, I raised the lamp to hit them but froze. 

“Sylvia?” 

“Hey! Have you gone mad?!” The maid screeched, stumbling with wide eyes. “Are you trying to kill me?!” 

I glanced at the clock. Oh, it was two hours before the man arrived. This meant Lovie and Atlas were still downstairs. 

“Your tea is ready.” Sylvia spat, setting it on my brown bedside table. Despite being my maid for years, she only followed Atlas’ orders. 

In the past, I raced downstairs, begging him to stay. Not anymore. I wasn’t going to ask for permission. 

I wasn’t going to wait till death arrived. I would attend that Runway and make it a memorable one. 

“Didn’t you hear me? Drink up!” She demanded and we locked eyes. 

When she didn’t win the staring contest, her face paled and she stared at me, confused. 

She had every right to be worried and confused. After all, in the past, she bossed me around and humiliated me in my home. 

I tightened my fist and glanced at the tea, recalling the lightheaded feeling I got after drinking it. 

I was so weak and that was how the masked man succeeded. 

Our eyes locked again as realization hit — Sylvia drugged me. 

“Mr. Volkan said you should drink this and sleep. You better follow his orders, or else, we will be forced to—” 

“You are fired,” I spoke calmly. 

The brown-haired woman’s eyes widened. “W-what?” She asked. “How dare you? Who do think you are to fire me? Look, your tea is already cold, and if you don’t take—” 

I collected the tea and she grinned. “That is more like — ah!” She cried and I watched as her uniform turned a shade darker, soaked in hot tea. 

I took a step forward and she stumbled until her back hit the wall. “Atlas, Lovie, they are not the boss of me. Much less, you.” 

“B-but, why are you acting this way?” Her voice shook. “I only asked you to drink tea —” 

I ignored her blabbering and strolled to my walk-in closet. I had to stop the runway. 

If the masked man arrived, he would kill me. No, this time I would not allow it. 

I frowned as I registered the light-colored dresses in the closet. 

In the past, I only wore these dresses to impress Atlas. I figured the more I looked like Lovie, the longer I could keep Atlas. 

Not anymore. 

I yanked the clothes from the hangers and tossed them to the ground. I raised an eyebrow when I caught sight of a bold black dress. 

Perfect. 

Lovie not only hated black dresses — The entire Volkan family loathed the color black. 

I pulled it out and walked over to my mirror. I reached for my hair, shutting my eyes as memories of Atlas filtered through. 

He told me the only good thing about me was my soft long hair. 

I kept growing it to please him. So, when I grabbed the scissors and started chopping it — I felt free. 

For three years, I tried to win Atlas’ heart. I clung to him. However, Atlas only ever saw me as his brother’s murderer. 

When I was dying, he abandoned me. 

Atlas Volkan took me for granted. He insulted my love and — 

“I’ll remind you that you are making a big mistake, you are insane!” 

I turned to Sylvia. “Dispose of the dresses. Wear them, throw them out, do whatever you wish.” I informed her, glancing at the clock. “I have a show to attend.” 

“No!” She rebuked, grabbing my wrist. I glanced at the clock, only five minutes more. “I won’t let you ruin Lady Lovie’s night!” 

I tried to yank my arm, my eyes widening as I registered how much time had passed. I glanced out the window behind me, my heart racing as I saw the masked man entering the house. 

No, no, no! 

“You won’t go anywhere till tomorrow, that is Mr. Volkan’s order!” She said, glaring at me. 

My breath hitched as the sound of banging came. He was at the door. I pushed Sylvia and raced out of the room, I had to leave through the backdoor and now. 

I ran down the stairs, my heart pounding in my chest as the walls of the mansion threatened to close in on me. 

I was about to step out when someone grabbed my hair. They pulled me back and I hit the dining table, crumbling to the ground. 

Goosebumps ran over my skin as we locked eyes. He pulled out a knife and I pushed a chair to him, standing. 

The masked man moved and I started throwing dishes at him — forcing him to take cover behind the kitchen door. 

I was trapped. I glanced around, searching for something — anything to help me survive. 

As he stepped forward, I grabbed the closest jar and threw the contents at him. I heaved a sigh of realization as he grunted, rubbing his eyes. 

It was powdered pepper. 

I bolted, running out the door without looking back. I had to get out, now! 

The taller man followed me. I could hear his steps as my heart raced — loud and malicious. 

Who was this masked man? Why did he want me dead? 

I slipped and rolled on the ground, my knees bruising. 

He pounced on me and started strangling me. I struggled to breathe, gasping for air as his grip tightened. 

No, things couldn’t end like this. 

I couldn’t lose a second time. Fate couldn’t be so cruel. 

Glancing around, I saw the knife from before, it must have fallen from his hand. 

As the last bit of air was squeezed from me, I took my chance. I grabbed the knife and stabbed him. 

The man froze, falling off me. His phone slipped out, ringing. 

The sound made me flinch but my eyes widened as I registered the caller’s name. 

“Lovie.” 

My blood boiled as I picked it up. 

I knew she was capable of everything — hurting, humiliating, manipulating me. 

Killing me, however? That was too low, even for her. 

Lovie didn’t just want everything — Lovie wanted to kill me. My sister wanted to kill me? 

My body slacked as the man bled, I was frozen, nursing the betrayal. 

I sacrificed everything for her. I agreed to marry Ryle in the past so she could be with Atlas and this… 

This was how she repaid me? 

I got up, my knees wobbling. The scent of betrayal and anguish was in the air, but I dared not cry. 

I had a runway to attend. I hailed a cab and got in, my fists tightening. When we saw each other, I would settle the score.",1,1754927979.0,Novelnews,1,1.0,False
1mngwb4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CurrentLiving/comments/1mngwb4/explore_if_the_best_electric_coffee_percolator/,Explore if the best electric coffee percolator Cuisinart PRC-12N is worth it,"Coffee-making became a delightful ritual the moment I started using the Cuisinart PRC-12N. As a self-professed coffee enthusiast, waking up to the gentle gurgle of this stainless steel percolator brewing a fresh pot has been a game-changer. The PRC-12N combines modern functionality with vintage charm, and its design immediately caught my attention. Its sleek stainless steel body not only looks sophisticated but also fits seamlessly into any kitchen aesthetic.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The first thing that struck me was the thoughtful craftsmanship of this coffee percolator. With its polished stainless steel exterior and transparent knob at the top, it offers a touch of retro elegance while staying durable and practical. The removable basket with clear measurement markings is incredibly intuitive—it takes any guesswork out of coffee preparation, which I found especially helpful on groggy mornings. What sets it apart is the knuckle guard, adding a layer of protection and comfort when pouring. The handle is sturdy and ergonomic, ensuring a firm grip, and the precision no-drip spout delivers on its promise. No messy spills on the counter, and every cup flows smoothly.  

[Check Cuisinart PRC-12N price on Amazon.](https://whyjoni.com/p/b0b6ln174x/)  

**Brewing Capacity and Performance**  
I tested it with various group settings, from cozy mornings alone to hosting brunches, and its range of 4 to 12 cups never felt limiting. The process is straightforward: add water, grounds, and plug it in. Watching the coffee percolate through the transparent knob became almost therapeutic. The device is manual, which adds to its charm and forces you to slow down and appreciate the process. My coffee brewed consistently hot with a bold flavor every time. It’s worth noting that I found the brewing time reasonable, taking just about ten minutes for a full pot.  

**Pluses**  
- The reusable filter saves on paper waste and cost.  
- Transparent brewing knob adds convenience and nostalgia.  
- Comfortable handle and knuckle guard improve the pouring experience.  

**Negatives**  
- It cools down relatively fast if left unplugged.  
- The power cord is on the shorter side, restricting placement options.  

**User Experience**  
What's great about this kitchen companion is how simple it makes brewing coffee for different occasions. I particularly enjoyed the way it left my kitchen smelling like a café. That said, its manual setup might take some adjustment for those accustomed to push-button coffee makers. For me, this slight extra effort was worth the superior taste that this traditional brewing method provided. My mom, who swears by old-fashioned techniques, claimed it reminded her of percolators from her younger days but with all the modern bells and whistles like the no-drip spout.  

**Other Options**  
When comparing the Cuisinart PRC-12N to other coffee makers, like modern drip brewers or single-serve machines, it clearly stands out for flavor purity and nostalgic appeal. A popular competitor, the Presto Stainless Steel Electric Percolator, comes close in performance but lacks the same level of grip comfort and spill-free convenience due to its less refined spout design. Meanwhile, pod-based machines like Keurig may win in speed and convenience, but they fail to match the rich depth of coffee achieved here.  

**Price Performance**  
For its clean brewing capabilities, robust construction, and thoughtful features, I’d say this percolator punches above its weight in value. Sure, it doesn’t have the fancy programmable options of some other machines, but the taste and simplicity justify the investment. You could spend more on machines that look modern but miss out on full-bodied coffee. For those who appreciate quality over automation or like to reintroduce a classic coffee-making ritual to their mornings, this one fits the bill perfectly.

1mngstq,https://www.reddit.com/r/PlugAndProof/comments/1mngstq/find_out_if_the_best_coffee_maker_technivorm/,Find Out if the Best Coffee Maker Technivorm Moccamaster Delivers,"If you're someone who values that perfect cup of coffee each morning, the Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 is undoubtedly worth your attention. Described as handcrafted in the Netherlands, this drip coffee machine promises a premium experience with every use. I’ve been testing it daily, and while it delivers on quality, there are a few things to consider.

**Design and Build Quality**  
The Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 doesn’t just make good coffee; it dominates your countertop with sleek elegance. Offered in a timeless off-white color, it strikes the perfect balance between modern aesthetic and classic charm. The dimensions—6.5 inches deep, 12.75 inches wide, and 14 inches tall—allow it to fit comfortably in most kitchen spaces. Its sturdy build adds a certain heft, which reassures you that it’s built to last. Plus, the glass carafe included complements the overall premium feel. And can we talk about the engineering? Every part feels thoughtfully crafted, almost like a luxury car but one that serves coffee.  

**Ease of Use**  
This machine is straightforward to operate, even on a groggy Monday morning. With just one switch and an intuitive Brew-Volume Selector, I found it refreshingly simple compared to more complicated models on the market. Brewing options allow for either a full pot or a half-carafe, which is great for someone like me who fluctuates between needing one cup or preparing enough for the family. 

**Check Technivorm Moccamaster 53933 price on Amazon.**  

**Performance and Coffee Quality**  
Here’s where the Technivorm Moccamaster really shines. It heats water to the optimal temperature for coffee extraction—a game-changer! I’ve tested it with several coffee blends, from dark roasts to lighter, fruitier beans, and this machine extracted those nuanced flavors every single time. Brewing is quick, with a full pot ready in just 4–6 minutes, but what impressed me most was the consistent quality. Whether I brewed a small or large amount, the coffee always felt just right, never bitter or burnt.  

**Advantages**  
There are so many positives about this coffee maker:  
- Rapid brewing makes it perfect for mornings when time is short.  
- The hot plate’s independent heating element ensures your coffee stays at the perfect temperature, without overheating or burning.  
- Quiet operation means no additional noise pollution in the morning—perfect for any home, especially with sleeping kids.  
- A robust five-year warranty gives you peace of mind about your investment.  

**Areas of Concern**  
No product is flawless, and the Technivorm Moccamaster has its quirks:  
- Replacement paper filters can add up over time—a potential recurring cost.  
- It lacks a built-in grinder, which might disappoint those who prefer grinding beans fresh.  
- The price point might seem steep to some buyers, especially if features like programmability are a high priority.  

**Other Options**  
Comparing it with competitors, the Technivorm Moccamaster holds its own but isn’t without stiff competition. Machines like the Breville Precision Brewer or the Oxo Brew 9-Cup offer more features like programmability and built-in grinders. However, these models don’t quite match the Technivorm’s simplicity and consistent extraction quality. For those focused on flavor and longevity, this coffee maker remains a standout option.  

**Best Value**  
While premium, the Moccamaster 53933 delivers on its price-to-quality ratio. Its robust design, relentless consistency, and five-year warranty make it a solid investment for coffee enthusiasts. It’s for those who care about taste and durability rather than an overwhelming array of features. Granted, some less expensive machines can also make good coffee, but this one feels built for those who want to splurge for an unparalleled experience.

The day started at 8:30am and it’s now going for 11 and he’s just now taking his shower. 

How? I witness it. He’s not on his phone in the bathroom, just has his book as usual. I genuinely don’t know how he takes up so much time doing such short tasks. 

He said yesterday that around today at 11 we should get out before the crowds get bad in downtown at this new bike shop he wants to visit. And here we are at 11am and he still needs to take his shower, shave, and drink his coffee. His day starts at 12:30-1pm. 

I genuinely can’t wrap my mind around how it takes a man 2.5hrs to eat a bowl of cereal and take a shit. I’m not expecting him to keep up with my exact pace either— I’m pretty speedy about things. But still I’d at least expect in that time to be able to eat, shower, and shit. Maybe adding shaving and coffee and it takes a bit longer for someone who isn’t as time efficient. 

But damn! How does someone wake up before 9 and their day isn’t even ready to actually begin until afternoon? 

Also before anyone asks, he usually prefers cereal or instant oatmeal for breakfast so that’s why I didn’t cook it for both of us. ",2,1754927682.0,JustNoSO,1,0.67,False

Mark is in full garden gnome mode. Beard extra bushy, hat extra pointy. He waddles through the entrance pushing a cart twice his size. Lin, his roadrunner sidekick for the day, is perched on the handle like a feathery hood ornament.**

 

**Mark:** “Okay, we’re here for three things: organic potting soil, Delta seeds…”

 

**Lin:** “Beep-beep!”

 

**Mark:** “…Fine, and maybe a succulent shaped like a dragon.”

 

**They navigate past a display Talavera frogs. A child gasps loudly:** “Mom! The gnome’s ALIVE!”

 

**Mark tips his hat solemnly:** “Stay in school, kid.”

 

**Over in the “Rare & Exotic” section, Mark is holding up a packet labeled “Delta Sprout: NOT FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION” and squinting.**

 

**Mark:** “This could help Raven.”

 

**Lin:** “Beep-beep?”

 

**Mark:** “No, I don’t think it’ll explode. But we’ll keep you at a safe distance just in case.”

 

**Things take a turn when Lin chases a cricket through the herb aisle, knocking over a pyramid of rosemary pots. The store’s** **very concerned** **cashier rushes over, only to find Mark trying to cover the mess with a bag of mulch.**

 

**Mark:** “We, uh… thought the rosemary needed more… horizontal exposure to sunlight?”

 

**As they finally make it to checkout, Mark loads the soil, seeds, and the dragon-shaped succulent onto the counter. The cashier raises an eyebrow as he scans the seed packet.**

 

**Cashier:** “Word of warning… those Delta plants grow like weeds.”

 

**Later…**

 

**Mark’s Pepper Patch, edge of St. Somewhere’s volcanic slopes. Snow from Mt. Caroline is still melting, leaving little rivers running through the dirt. A big bag of soil sits open, seed packets are scattered like playing cards, and a suspicious amount of coffee cups are half-buried in the mud.**

 

**Mark stands at the plot with a trowel in one hand and the** **Delta Sprout** **packet in the other.**

 

**Mark:** “Okay… so step one is—”

 

**Lin dashes in a circle, honking.**

 

**Mark:** “No, that was step three. I think. Was it?”

 

**Before they can figure it out, Kitty, Mark’s** **giant ladybug pet**\*\*, lands with a\*\* **WHUMP**\*\*, her wings folding neatly. She meeps twice, then starts her “aphid patrol” on the nearby pepper plants.\*\*

 

**Mark:** “Kitty, no eating the Delta plant when it’s grown. This is science, not lunch!”

 

**Step one turns into an adventure when Lin decides to dig the hole himself. He sprays dirt directly into Mark’s beard. Mark retaliates by trying to water the hole, but he forgets the watering can is already full and dumps** **half a bucket** **over Lin’s head.**

 

**Lin:** “BEEP!!!”

 

**Kitty, sensing chaos, rolls the Delta seeds around like marbles, meeping happily as Mark chases her. By the time Raven wanders in, the seeds are planted… kind of. Some are in neat rows, others are in what can only be described as chaos and at least one is tucked into the pocket of Mark’s gnome hat.**

 

**Raven:** “What exactly happened here?”

 

**Mark:** “Teamwork!”

 

**Lin honks at her.**

 

**Kitty:** “MEEP!”

 

**Raven shakes her head, but when the first tiny Delta sprout pokes up a week later… it’s clear that whatever gardening method this was… it worked.**

 

**One week later.**

 

**The Delta sprout in Mark’s garden is no longer a sprout. It’s a three-foot glowing beanstalk-meets-coral-reef looking thing that hums softly at night and smells faintly like lemon cookies.**

 

**Mark is standing there with his hands on his hips. Lin is perched on the garden fence, tail flicking like a cat ready to pounce. Kitty is clinging to one of the plant’s leaves, meeping like she’s discovered gold.**

 

**Mark:** “I’m starting to think Kitty did fertilize this thing.”

 

**Kitty:** “MEEPER!”

 

The trouble starts when the sprout grows again. Shooting up another foot in the time it takes Mark to turn around and grab his coffee. Lin jumps off the fence and starts running laps around it, convinced it’s a race. The Delta plant responds by twisting toward him like it wants to play.

 

**Mark:** “That’s not in the planting manual!”

 

**Lin honks happily.**

 

**Then the humming gets louder… and poof! The Delta sprout spits out a small puffball seed the size of a basketball. Kitty pounces instantly and rolls it toward Mark.**

 

**It bursts. In seconds, a ton of** **tiny** **Delta sprouts start popping up everywhere. Between pepper plants, in Mark’s boots, on top of Lin’s tail feathers.**

 

**Mark:** “We’ve got a Delta infestation!”

 

**Kitty:** “MEEP! MEEP!”

 

 **She is** **thrilled** **about this.**

 

**By the time Raven arrives, the original Delta is gently swaying, as if it’s proud of its chaotic plant-children now filling the garden. Raven just sighs, hands Mark a basket, and says:**

 

**Raven:** “You better start harvesting before we have a forest.”

 

**Mark glances at the glowing sprouts, at Kitty meeping happily, and at Lin speeding among the plants like it is a racecourse.**

 

**Mark:** “…I’m keeping one.”

1mngq30,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1mngq30/i_want_to_stop/,I want to stop,"And have tried on and off the last several years. I think the longest I was successful was about six months with an external motivator, but as soon as I had that first one after, I fell back on and haven't gone more than a week since. Husband and I usually do a six pack each on weekends and a couple glasses of wine or cider on weeknights.  More or liquor if one of us has had a stressful day/week. 

Ever since my psych medication got adjusted to where I no longer feel depressed, it just doesn't feel good anymore except for one specific sweet spot I can never hit on purpose. It ruins my sleep, it drags my mood down, I'm pretty sure the bulk of the weight I put on several years ago was from drinking during lockdown and a deep point of my depression (right before my meds were fixed, and we drank more liquor at that time too).

My last drink was a Seagrams cooler with dinner Saturday, and I only chose it for the taste. I could've just as easily grabbed the sparkling water next to it, which I enjoy the flavor of equally if not more. Before 5pm on weekdays, I basically only drink water with flavoring packets or gatorade when I need an electrolyte boost, sometimes a soda if we get takeout or a coffee on groggy mornings. I'll get cocktail or two if we go out for dinner. But evenings and weekends at home are a free for all. 

The worst part now I think is that my husband recently took up brewing his own cider. It tastes good and I love that he has hobbies he enjoys! It just makes it feel that much harder for me. All cracking open a bottle or two of it with him does is give me a headache when I wake up in the middle of the night. He's never pressured me. Alcohol is not something that forged our relationship, we met years before either of us could or were drinking. He always asks first, I just have a hard time saying no sometimes. 

I'm only 26. I don't want this to be the rest of my life and right now it feels that way. I feel confident in my ability to start quitting for real right now, but even making this post is making my anxiety spike. I suppose I just need a little encouragement to take that step.

Rules were rules. I was desperate to to feel her in my arms, and the ten days seemed a cruel extension of our already long separation. At least she now had good internet connection, and we promised each other long quality videocalls in the evenings- a luxury after the poor internet of where she had been.

 

The first few days, she was feverish – some bug she must have picked up from the airport. But soon, she was feeling much better, and I could barely wait to get home and call her. The highlight of my day, when I could finally lock the door and enjoy her virtual company, without the connection dropping or any distraction. 

 

It must have been on the eighth day when it first happened.



I rushed home, opened up my laptop and placed the call.



Within a few seconds, she flickered in sight, wearing a black zip-up sweater, zipped up to her neck. 



“You want a peek babe?” she asked.



I felt as eager as if she were before me in flesh. “C’mon darlin’” 



She unzipped the zipper, just down her neck. “This good?” she teased.



She unzipped a bit more, I could see her collarbones. Something was wrong with the internet quality - she flickered, her head - what- no - her face - something glistening was under her sweatshirt -



“Liking what you see?” she cooed and pulled down further.



A greenish-black texture was visible on her skin. Her face flickered again, and I glimpsed flaring eyes and sharp teeth in a scaly face. I leapt back, and slammed the laptop shut.



My cellphone dinged.



\-babe what happened?



I responded: Idk internet isnt working

 

\-ok lmk when u get back I rly wanna show something 



I didn’t go back online that night. Emily texted me, but I pretended that my internet was still out, and went to bed as soon as I could, pleading a headache.

 

The next day she bombarded my phone with loving messages and pictures of herself. I put the scaly vision of last night out of my head and raced to my laptop at home as soon as I could.



She was waiting for me online, again covered to the neck.



“Here we go babe” she said, and in one swift motion pulled the zipper down, revealing for one instant her beautiful body.



The image flickered, and a scaly glistening greenish-black creature seemed super-imposed on her, with flaring yellow eyes and sharp protruding teeth.



I cried out, blinked, and the creature vanished. I was once again staring at the body and face of my beloved Emily on my screen.



“You likey?” she asked, smiling expectantly, her pink lips curving in what I would have thought until two seconds ago the world’s most beautiful smile. 



“Yes- oh- yes” I whimpered. 



She leaned in so far her soft lips almost touching the webcam- “It will all be yours, soon, my sweetheart. All yours. We will finally be together. Oh, I can barely wait for tomorrow” and she ran her tongue over her lips.



Her tongue was narrow and forked and her teeth fanged.



I jumped back. 



She frowned. “What is it Matthew?”



“Nothing- - oh, I can’t wait.” Despite myself, her suggestive movements started arousing me, and I allowed myself to enjoy her company.

 

I spent the next day confused. I kept trying to dismiss the terrible vision as some hacking prank, but it was too vivid, the scales glistening and the eyes flaring too brightly to convince myself.



The day after, she was out of isolation.



“Im coming over babe” she texted, as soon as I got home.



“Emily u dont have to” I texted desperately.



She texted back immediately “?? U got a new gf while I was stuck inside?”

 



My heart sank. “Don’t be ridiculous”.





“ok Ill be there 30 min”

 

Frantically, I texted.



“Hey going out to grab coffee meet at the usual?”



Barely five seconds passed “ur gonna a dump me! And ur too coward to do at home, ur doing it at coffee shop!!!”



“I just want a coffee! I’ll meet you there- already outta the door!”

 



She arrived within five minutes of me seating myself outside, on the small pavement patio. Despite her red teary eyes, she looked as beautiful as ever, and the now-familiar doubt of what I had seen on screen crept in. I took her hands.

 



“Emily” I began.

 



She began ugly-crying. “You’re dumping me – I can’t believe- you started sleeping with someone else while I was away-“ she sobbed. Other customers furiously pretended to mind their own business, and the server discreetly stood away.

 



“No- I swear-“ I said, feeling helplessly. “It’s just-“

 



“Just what?!” she slammed her hands on the table, and stopped crying. A horrible hush fell over the patio. The server rattled his tray.

 



She leaned towards me. “Just what, asshole?” she hissed.

 



As I stared into her eyes, I saw her pupils swim and change shape into vertical slits, suspended in the blue of her eyes.  



I jumped up and began running. 

 



Emily slid out from behind the table in a lithe movement and followed me.





“Matthew!” I heard her cry- “stop- I love yo- “



Her voice was cut off by horrible skidding brake sound, a scream. For a split second, everything was still. I looked back, seeing the crowd surge to where her crushed body was lying on the street.



The sun was shining in my eyes but I know I saw two men dressed jeans clear the crowd. I saw them pick her up and take her, not to an ambulance, but inside a plain black van.

I am trying to solve this puzzle and would appreciate any supplement or diet advice you can give. I have been a coffee drinker for 8 years now. My standard 'dose' is one cup each day. If i do 2 cups for a day I feel amazing and almost on top of the world. But the next day I am depressed and deflated until I have my second cup again. My tolerance gets reset to 2 cups and I go through a depressing withdrawal until I normalize back down to 1 cup per day. I hate the depression but I want to feel alive everyday. I understand that this has somewhat to do with dopamine as ive taken dopamine supplements and did not get same high but did get the horrible withdrawal depression. I took bocopa puriens and didn't feel any different until I stopped taking them the next day and felt horribly depressed. So is it acetylcholine? Norepinephrine? Epinephrine? I went through 3 to 4 SSRI's 3 years ago and they all ruined my life making me a vegetable that was so depressed and overwhelmed. Im not that way anymore but I am back to a baseline that still sucks. When I eat eggs I feel awesome and super productive but I am not in the mood to be sociable and feel also meaningless except to get work done or progress to the next thing. I have a slow comt gene so I am likely sensitive to stimulants and too much acetylcholine activity. Even 1 egg gives me have choline depression. I can't have eggs anyway as my GI doesn't tolerate them unfortunately. I can't do much dairy as I might be intolerant from the miserable symptoms that come from consuming it. If i eat chicken or turkey I get sluggish likely from the tryptophan and I feel lifeless similarly to taking the SSRI's. My goal is to not wakeup feeling unmotivated and depressed. Caffeine and eggs have been my only 'highs' other than the different 'high' that alcohol gives. Its a vicious cycle and I want to have a normal level of neurotransmitters like people that seem to have a stable happy life. Any advice is welcome. Thank you. ,1,1754927509.0,SlowCOMT,0,1.0,False

1mngo7d,https://www.reddit.com/r/biologicalrecovery/comments/1mngo7d/little_routine_for_optimizing_daily_cortisol/,Little routine for optimizing daily cortisol rhythm (this is a relatively very practical and low exertion lifestyle tweak. A low hanging fruit with great potential benefit),"Try a cup of coffee (or somewhat less effectively vis. Cortisol and cAMP, tea) 30-45 minutes after waking with no sugar or additives, to really line up with body’s natural cortisol production and get a higher peak cortisol and a harmonious timing for caffeine to reach its highest level in the blood / Cmax. Follow this within 5-10 minutes with a shake or some lower fat food with about a 2:1 protein to simple carb ratio. Don’t go too high on the carbs or it can lower the natural cortisol peak too soon, around 5-15 grams seems to be pretty optimal. Avoid starch but honey, fruit, orange juice has great glucose/fructose balance, sometimes even sucrose or lactose is alright here. 

With the above, very importantly, get at least 10 minutes of sunlight right on your face, within half an hour of rising, as this is great not only for circadian rhythm and thyroid health and downstream melatonin production and vitamin d production if it’s direct sunlight or a UVB lamp (or use a 10000 lux+ cool light lamp if sunlight not available; direct sunlight is best by a long shot, followed by sunlight through a window), it also increase cortisol production right away in a very natural harmony with the body’s own waking surge, and later, the cortisol level plunges deeper. Don’t stare directly at the sun stare near it, unless perhaps you’re practicing one of those yogas that involves direct starring, and be moderate and careful with those if you do. 

The main idea here is to get a high cortisol peak in morning and low cortisol trough by time you’re getting ready for bed. Also, want to reduce the flattening of the cortisol level curve so that once cortisol has gone quite high, it declines fairly commensurately and steeply, but does not go from high to some sort of medium level with a smaller slope leading into bed time.

Optimizing this facet, daily cortisol rhythms, can really work wonders for energy and sleep and metabolism  and mood and endocrine function and all sorts of things, including restoring motivation through modulation of various relevant levers including, iirc, dopamine D1 receptor density. Out of the range of things one can do to return to pre-addiction health and energy and life satisfaction (or to even go beyond these previous norms), this lifestyle intervention is handily one of the lowest hanging fruits to reach for. 

Somewhat tangential to all this, more related to dopaminergic tone and receptor balance and willpower cultivation: be very careful about doom scrolling, especially later in the day.

Fallout: New Republic — Book One

The hum of dormant systems awakens with a low, resonant thrum.

Lights ripple on in sequence, bleeding pale fluorescence across Bunker 13’s war room. The air smells of steel, oil, and dust older than any man alive. Vice President Alexander Ward stands in the center, his uniform still immaculate despite the years on ice. His breath clouds faintly in the cold air. Behind him, a holotable flickers awake, painting the room with digital blue light. “Good morning, Mr. Vice President,” comes the warm, measured voice of Lincoln — the bunker’s AI. His holographic form shimmers into existence at Ward’s side: tall, stately, dressed like an old-world statesman, but with eyes too sharp and too knowing. “It’s been ten years since your initial revival. Are you ready to wake the rest?” Ward exhales slowly, as if steadying himself. “I’ve been ready for two centuries, Lincoln. How’s my Ark?” The AI’s eyes flick upward, processing. “The Ark is… intact. But the people still sleep.” “They won’t for long.” Ward’s tone hardens. “The world is ash and ruin out there. We don’t have time for hesitation.” Lincoln tilts his head. “You still see them as an Ark crew. Most of them will simply see themselves as Americans.” “That’s fine,” Ward says, lips curling into a faint smile. “They’ll learn.”Lincoln’s tone shifts, more personal now. “While you slept, I’ve monitored what remains of our nation. Raven Rock — silent. The Congressional Bunker — dark. Our other continuity-of-government sites — lost or overrun. We are, quite literally, the last functioning enclave of the United States.” Ward doesn’t flinch. “Then we carry the weight. That’s what leadership is.” Lincoln steps closer, voice lowering. “I’ve watched the Commonwealth for two hundred years. It has… pockets of life. Bunker Hill, Fenway Park’s stadium, a settlement called Goodneighbor. Even C.I.T., though they went dark long ago. They still send out the faintest ripples — they do not want to be found.” Ward’s eyes narrow. “And the Institute? No word?”“None. No verifiable contact. No confirmation they survived the bombs.

# Chapter One — The Ark

The cryo bay is a cathedral of frost and humming machines.

Rows of pods curve along the walls like pews, each one filmed in ice, each one holding a face the world forgot. The lights wake in a slow sweep, pale and cold, revealing steel ribs and braided conduit and the breath-white air that leaks off the glass.

Vice President Alexander Ward walks the center aisle with his hands clasped behind his back. He does not scrape his knuckles along the pods or touch the glass; he lets his eyes do the touching, lingering on names he already knows. He has done this a hundred times in ten years—counting, remembering, rehearsing.

“These are the last,” he says to the quiet, to the sleeping, to himself. “The last Republic.”

He stops at a pod clouded with frost. The face beneath is only a suggestion, then a man, then someone he once briefed in a room that didn’t smell like cold metal. Ward’s breath fogs the glass. He leans very slightly, a confessional in reverse.

“Look alive, folks,” he murmurs. “The flood is coming… and only the Ark will stand.”

No one answers. The machines keep breathing. Somewhere deeper, a pump changes its rhythm, a bass note shifting into resolve.

“Wake them,” Ward says, not loudly—just the way a man says something that has already been decided.

From a speaker tucked above the bay doors, Lincoln’s voice answers as if he has been standing at Ward’s shoulder the whole time. “Acknowledged, Mr. Vice President. Initiating revival sequence.”

Valves click. Lines pressurize. The pods exhale white. Seals pop like knuckles being cracked. Across the bay, frost cracks and curls as lids lift.

The first breath a man takes after two centuries sounds like drowning.

Jake plants his palms on the lip of his pod and drags air into lungs that have forgotten the trick. He coughs hard and ugly, bends, coughs again, then forces his eyes to focus. The room swims into place: steel, light, the suggestion of other people wrenching themselves back into gravity.

“Nora,” he rasps.

A pod to his right hisses. She rises like a swimmer breaking the surface, hair stuck to her cheek, eyes already scanning the exits before she remembers her husband’s voice.

“Still alive,” she says, and the way she says it makes the room feel a half-degree warmer.

The third lid cracks open and Martin Rann pours out of it like a thought he’s not ready to have. He is long-limbed and pale, twenty-one years old by a calendar that means nothing, and his feet slap metal like he has never owned them before. Jake reaches and catches his elbow.

“Easy, kid.”

“Everything is…” Martin swallows against air that smells wrong. “…loud.”

The others open. Men and women in black uniforms with gold piping find the floor and themselves. Some cry without sound; some look like they’ve been awake forever; a few throw up and then stand, embarrassed and stubborn.

Ward is there without fanfare. No speech. No PA. No halo. He is just a man in a neat coat and a steady gaze, moving through them, meeting eyes, saying, “Welcome,” and “Take your time,” and, “That dizziness will pass.” When he reaches Jake and Nora and Martin, he stops.

“Captain Renner,” he says, and Jake’s back straightens because the part of him that is all training and instinct hears rank in the name. “Nora. Dr. Rann.”

“Just Martin,” Martin manages, because his mouth is faster than his sense.

Ward’s smile is small. “Just Martin, then. Welcome to the new world.”

He doesn’t say what he is thinking: that the world is old and broken and still theirs.

The briefing hall smells like ozone and ambition. It is not a theater, but it has a stage. It is not a church, but it has that hush. People pack the benches, some with blankets still around their shoulders, all of them facing a holotable dark as a pond before it takes the sky.

Lincoln arrives with the room’s first real warmth: a human figure made of light, lines clean, suit immaculate, eyes too still to be eyes and yet somehow warmer than most. When he speaks, the sound fills corners.

“Good afternoon,” he says, and the words are absurd enough to make a few people laugh. “Welcome back to active service. I am Lincoln—bunker operations intelligence, continuity-of-government liaison, and your most patient colleague. I have kept the lights on for you.”

The holotable lifts a ghosted continent. Red pins ignite and gutter out. Lincoln’s voice is not cruel and not kind; it is exact.

“Our President is gone. Our Congress is gone. Raven Rock broadcast until it did not. The Congressional bunker answered until it did not. The western sites—NORAD West, Mountain Two—went off our boards in a storm of local conflict and famine. The southern strongpoint failed during the Food Riots. Coastal arcology Sector Nine breached during the Great Melt. For a century and more, nothing spoke back to us.”

He does not say *we are alone*. He does not have to.

He gestures, and the map draws in, the Commonwealth sharpening into riddled streets and broken bones. “Above us, the Commonwealth persists. Bunker Hill: a trading nexus with fluctuating leadership but durable practice. Fenway Park—now Diamond City: fortified, populous, bureaucratic. Goodneighbor: permissive, charismatic, transient order. Outside these nodes are farms, outposts, and brave attempts at living. There are raiders. There are super mutants, byproducts of Forced Evolutionary Virus programs that were not ours. There are feral ghoul populations and non-feral ghoul communities. There is weather that has learned new tricks.”

He looks, just briefly, to where Ward stands in the gloom. “C.I.T. went dark immediately after the war. For two centuries I have watched the place where it used to be a light. I have seen ripples—energy surges inconsistent with surface generation and narrowband transmissions without reply. I have never received a welcome.”

He lets the map breathe and then dims it.

“We remain,” Lincoln says, softer. “Bunker Thirteen. The last operational continuity site of the United States.”

Ward steps into the light as if he has always been there and the room simply remembered to show him. He doesn’t raise his voice. He doesn’t have to. The way he holds a sentence makes people lean forward.

“You all have questions,” he says. “Concerns. Fears.” The words are a cadence he has practiced at three in the morning, alone. “All is close to being well. The others are gone. We are not. We are America’s last hope. Her last Republic.”

He looks across faces that are waiting to be told what to do, and for a moment he looks very tired and very young and then not at all.

“Look alive, folks,” he says, expanding on the line he spoke to the sleeping, letting it grow claws and wings. “We woke into a flood. Not water—chaos. A flood of small tyrannies and large hungers. A flood that carries away what’s left if no one builds something that stands. Only the Ark stands. The Ark is not a myth. It is a plan.”

A beat. A breath.

“The Ark Protocol,” Ward continues, “begins with what we can hold. We do not announce ourselves in a city. We do not plant a flag in a market. We choose a place that is small, stubborn, and ours to lose. We make it proof that the Republic lives. We make it a seed that carries.”

He does not say the place yet. Not for theater; for timing. He lets the idea find its own gravity.

“We will reconnoiter,” Ward finishes. “We will not blunder. We will move with care.”

He nods—to Lincoln, to the map, to the future—and steps out of the light.

A week irons some of the stiffness from bodies and some of the shock from eyes. In that week, Jake remembers how to lace boots without thinking about it, and Nora remembers how to move like a shadow, and Martin discovers that hunger and curiosity feel very similar if you are not careful.

Jake and Nora make a ritual of dragging Martin out of the lab and into the gym, where he learns again how to fall without breaking and to breathe through the ache. Jake brings him coffee he does not want and then watches him drink it because he needs it. Nora teaches him to keep his finger away from the trigger until the world actually needs changing.

On the eighth morning, Ward signs a paper with a pen he sharpens with a knife and says, “Light recon.”

They go three: Jake, Nora, Martin. No Vertibirds, no banners, no convoy to wake sleeping dogs. The bunker door opens and throws them into a light that feels wrong because it is simply real.

The Commonwealth wears winter like a coat it can’t take off. Patches of snow squat in the shade. Ice plates the shoulders of the road. In the wind, there is a metallic bite that belongs to dust the body knows better than the mind.

They move along the ribcage of a toppled overpass and into the skeleton of an industrial park. A factory looms, brick and broken glass and rusted catwalks turning the light into knives.

Inside, the air is stale and warm, all machine breath and rot. Jake raises two fingers. Nora peels left, low and quick. Martin tries to peel right and nearly trips on an old conveyor belt, then recovers with the embarrassed face of a man who knows he is being filmed by history.

Voices. Not theirs.

Raiders come like a cough—sudden, ugly, and hard to stop. Six of them, a smear of leather and scavenged armor, a leader with a face scored by years and a red stripe painted down his nose like a promise. He opens his mouth to shout and then looks down.

His boots are in his son.

“Trig,” someone says behind him, as if the name might call him back into shape. “Trig—oh, hell—boss—”

The leader looks at the smear spreading under his heels, at the green sheen skidding across concrete, at the steam rising off what used to be a man. His face does a strange thing: it empties and then fills with something that does not have a useful name.

“Which one of you—” he begins, and then no longer cares which.

The first shots are wild and high. Nora is gone already, a suggestion of movement above, her stealth suit drinking light and sound. Jake returns fire with the precision of a man who has learned not to waste more than he can afford. A raider spins and goes down with surprise still climbing his face.

Martin presses his back to a cracked column and realizes two things at once: his hands are shaking and his brain has decided to keep working anyway. He reaches into his satchel, snaps a microcapacitor into the plasma rifle’s guts, dials the containment field a hair past sane, feels the weapon change its hum from cat to tiger.

“Kid,” Jake barks without looking. “Whatever you’re doing—do it fast.”

Martin peels around the column and fires. The bolt leaves the rifle with a sound like a scream biting its own throat. It hits the leader center mass and blossoms into white-green hunger. The man is there and then not there, the world briefly lit by a light that shouldn’t exist anymore.

Two raiders run for the catwalk stairs; Nora’s mines say *no* in a voice of blue-white frost. Ice rushes up their legs, stops them mid-stride, turns them into something that weighs more than regret. They shatter before they learn a lesson.

The room goes quiet in steps: the last clatter of a casing, the tick of heat surrendering to air, the small sharp sound a weapon makes when it decides not to fire anymore.

Martin looks at the place where a man was and at the streaks his boots left behind and bends double. He tries not to; his body disagrees. It is fast and ugly and loud.

Jake touches his shoulder once, the way a big brother does when the only thing to say is not a sentence. “There, there,” he mutters, keeping his eyes on the catwalk. “Don’t make it weird. We’re just two hundred years in the future and you’re not throwing up beef stroganoff this time.”

“I didn’t even—” Martin gags and laughs and coughs. “—eat stroganoff.”

“Good,” Jake says. “Hate that stuff.”

Nora drops out of the shadows like an answer. “Clear,” she says, already collecting her mines, already watching the angles. She glances at Martin, then at the smear. “You saved lives,” she says, simple as arithmetic.

On the way home, the wind keeps changing its mind. The world smells like wet iron and old rubber and something that might be hope if you squint.

Reyes laughs until his side hurts when he watches the feed. “Kid turns a raider into soup and then loses his lunch. Peak post-war cinema.” He claps Martin hard enough to rediscover a bruise. “You did good.”

Martin smiles without finding it funny. Later, when the corridor is quiet and the smell of coffee and gun oil has faded into the walls again, he goes to the holochamber and says, “Lincoln.”

The AI arrives like a door opening into a warm room. “Dr. Rann.”

“The overcharge?” Martin asks, already hearing the answer.

“Effective,” Lincoln says. “Not stable. You increased yield by one hundred seventy-three percent and flirted with a thirty percent chance of cascade failure. You rolled dice and won. I request you bias your luck with math next time.”

“I will,” Martin says, because he knows he has to. He stares at his hands. “Does any of this—do people—can we actually live up there?”

Lincoln tilts his head, as if listening to two centuries in the conduits. “Air: survivable. Particulate burden spikes with southwesterly winds—avoid drafts off the Glowing Sea when possible. Water: filtration mandatory. Slow sand filters with charcoal beds will reduce radionuclides and pathogens to tolerable levels; boil advisories during flood events. Soil: cesium‑137 remains in the upper profile. Half-life thirty years; we are into our fourth, which means time has done some work for us. Clay is your ally; it binds radionuclides. Plant shallow. Rotate with legumes to fix nitrogen. Use sunflowers to drink the bad in hot spots. If we intervene with care, survival becomes stability in two seasons. With stability, prosperity in five.”

Martin lets the numbers ladder a future into place. “Settlements?” he asks. “Files?”

“I log significant hubs,” Lincoln says. “Bunker Hill, Diamond City, Goodneighbor. Others were below thresholds. Forty years ago I sent Eyebots. Abernathy was modest then. It has grown. I… admire them.”

“You love Abernathy,” Martin says before he remembers not to personify the machine that became a person while no one was looking.

“I love resilience,” Lincoln says. “I love evidence that hope is not a rumor.”

“Ward says we are the hope,” Martin murmurs.

“Perhaps two things can be true.”

Martin sighs. “Don’t call me sir. I’m not old.”

“Technically, you are two hundred twenty-one.”

“Jesus.” Martin scrubs his face and laughs because the only other option isn’t useful. “That’ll be all.”

Two days later, the bunker smells like coffee that forgot to be kind. The hall is full—soldiers in crisp blacks, civilians with notebooks, engineers with grease under their nails. The holotable is already awake when Lincoln arrives.

“This is a debriefing and a briefing,” Lincoln says. “The mission returned with environmental data within survivable parameters. Raiders remain an active threat vector. The Commonwealth is what we expected and worse. Now—the world.”

He throws the past into the air: the Great War that finished what people started, the weeks after when maps meant hunger and heat and nothing else, the years when little governments tried to stand and learned how tall famine is. He speaks of our Enclave in *we* and *us*: We retreated, we waited, we sent messages into silence. We listened. We watched men put crowns on their own heads and other men take them off with bullets. We watched Vault-Tec’s doors fail open and sometimes fail closed. We watched the Brotherhood march east and the Commonwealth learn new names for old mistakes.

“Raven Rock is gone,” he says, softer than the sentence deserves. “The Congressional bunker, gone. Our other sites, gone or feral. This is not a roll call. It is a eulogy.”

He lets the map rest on the three names that will matter for a while: Bunker Hill, Diamond City, Goodneighbor. He underlines one more that matters only to him and one other man: a farm with a fence that never gives up.

Ward steps forward and the room realigns by habit. He doesn’t clear his throat or shuffle notes; he carries sentences like they were built to get from him to other people without effort.

“You all have questions,” he says, and it is almost gentle. “Concerns. Fears. All is close to being well.” He expands on the private homily he gave to frost and sleeping men, and now it is a sermon. “The flood is not water. It is suffering. It is entropy. It is the easy breaking apart of things. Only the Ark stands. The Ark is not hiding. It is preserving. It is choosing what is worth carrying across a bad river and setting it down on the other side.”

He nods to Lincoln. The AI brightens the northwest of the map, and a small light kindles in the fields.

“Abernathy Farm,” Ward says. He says it like he’s saying *home*, but not for himself. “Good land. Good people. Far enough from markets that their politics won’t become ours overnight. Close enough that our help is not a rumor. I have been there.” A few heads turn; that is new. “As a trader, long before we woke the rest. They are stubborn and honest. They have learned to live wrong and would like to learn to live right. Perfect for a first trial.”

There’s a ripple of talk, the kind of sound that admits the idea into the body even if the mind is not yet convinced.

Lincoln raises a hand and the holotable fills with a material diagram—cells like honeycomb, a cross-section like bread.

“Pre‑War military composite,” he says. “Nicknamed ‘puffcreet.’ Closed‑cell aerated cement with foamed aluminum silicate injected under vacuum. Properties: exceptional strength‑to‑weight ratio; shock absorption via cellular collapse; high thermal mass; low porosity; good resistance to radwater infiltration; manufacturable in low‑infrastructure environments. Light enough to carry. Strong enough to make someone decide a different target looks easier.”

He glances toward the lab seats. “Dr. Rann?”

Martin stands and his mouth tries to outrun his caution. “Right, so—puffcreet isn’t just concrete with air. The cell geometry is tuned so that when a projectile hits, the first layer collapses, eating the energy and trapping the round before it can spall. Think of it like a field of tiny crumple zones. Thermal mass means the walls drink heat in the day and bleed it back at night—so you burn less wood, less fuel. Low porosity means if you splash this stuff with radwater, it doesn’t wick it inside where you live. If we lay a sublayer under fences, tunneling gets a lot less fun. We can cast panels in forms with nothing more than a mixer, a compressor, and patience—”

“NERD!” someone at the back yells, not mean so much as delighted to have a target.

A smatter of snorts. A few laughs. One “sit down, Einstein.”

Ward doesn’t raise his voice. “Enough.” The room obeys because the tone bothers the spine. He looks back to Martin. “Build me a wall, Doctor. One that looks like kindness from the inside and work from the outside.”

Martin swallows, nods, and sits, cheeks hot and smiling anyway because it is a good problem to have.

Jake lifts a hand. “Why Abernathy over the dozens like it, sir? We got a lot of fences to fix between here and there.”

Ward does not blink. “Because I’ve seen it with my eyes. Because I’ve drunk their bad coffee and heard their good jokes. Because they haven’t given up, and that is the most expensive commodity left in the Commonwealth. Because we can learn there without Diamond City thinking we mean to govern them tomorrow.”

Nora: “Mission profile?”

“Contact first,” Ward says. “No flags. No speeches. We help with what hurts today. We lay foundations—literal and otherwise—without telling stories we cannot finish. We screen quietly—for skills, for will, for people who can carry more than their share on a bad day.” He lets that hang, a flick of the Ark’s shadow across the floor, then moves on. “Then we fortify. Puffcreet panels for the house and pen. Bell lines on the west fence. Stake carts at the north corner with spokes out—Captain, your idea was elegant. Water—we’ll trench to the culvert and build slow beds. We will not announce a Republic. We will behave like one.”

The holotable dims except for the single gold pin west of Boston. The room feels like the moment before rain.

“This is where the Ark begins,” Ward says.

No one cheers. The right things rarely earn applause at the start. Instead, people make lists. Engineers whisper about forms and molds. Quartermasters count wire in their heads. Soldiers draw a fence in the air with two fingers and mark where the ground rises and falls.

Jake feels the weight that lives between his shoulder blades shift, not heavier or lighter, just different, like a pack you’ve decided to carry because the man next to you is carrying one, too. Nora watches the map and smiles a small, private smile that isn’t about victory so much as the pleasure of doing something the correct way. Martin writes the word **Abernathy** at the top of a page and then, after a heartbeat, writes **Nathy** beneath it because that is how names become home.

Lincoln dims the lights one degree like a hand on a fevered brow.

In the cryo bay that is no longer a church but will always remember the prayers, frost melts and runs in thin lines toward the drains. In the world above, a farm lights a lamp against a window, and no one there knows why the night feels different.

Only Ward looks at the map and sees not a pin but a door.

1mngnpe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1mngnpe/which_neurotransmitters/,Which Neurotransmitters?,Hey all. I am trying to solve this puzzle and would appreciate any supplement or diet advice you can give. I have been a coffee drinker for 8 years now. My standard 'dose' is one cup each day. If i do 2 cups for a day I feel amazing and almost on top of the world. But the next day I am depressed and deflated until I have my second cup again. My tolerance gets reset to 2 cups and I go through a depressing withdrawal until I normalize back down to 1 cup per day. I hate the depression but I want to feel alive everyday. I understand that this has somewhat to do with dopamine as ive taken dopamine supplements and did not get same high but did get the horrible withdrawal depression. I took bocopa puriens and didn't feel any different until I stopped taking them the next day and felt horribly depressed. So is it acetylcholine? Norepinephrine? Epinephrine? I went through 3 to 4 SSRI's 3 years ago and they all ruined my life making me a vegetable that was so depressed and overwhelmed. Im not that way anymore but I am back to a baseline that still sucks. When I eat eggs I feel awesome and super productive but I am not in the mood to be sociable and feel also meaningless except to get work done or progress to the next thing. I have a slow comt gene so I am likely sensitive to stimulants and too much acetylcholine activity. Even 1 egg gives me have choline depression. I can't have eggs anyway as my GI doesn't tolerate them unfortunately. I can't do much dairy as I might be intolerant from the miserable symptoms that come from consuming it. If i eat chicken or turkey I get sluggish likely from the tryptophan and I feel lifeless similarly to taking the SSRI's. My goal is to not wakeup feeling unmotivated and depressed. Caffeine and eggs have been my only 'highs' other than the different 'high' that alcohol gives. Its a vicious cycle and I want to have a normal level of neurotransmitters like people that seem to have a stable happy life. Any advice is welcome. Thank you. ,0,1754927420.0,Supplements,1,0.5,False

Right now, our top choices are Oakwood Apartments Azabu and Section L West Shimbashi. I’ve heard Shimbashi can be a bit quieter, which is fine, but given it’ll be winter, we’re considering which area would be the better fit. We like being able to step out for coffee or a quick bite, have a few drinks at a nearby bar, and on some days just stay in the neighborhood to eat or relax. Most days, we’ll likely be out exploring all day. Will either area feel too quiet late at night—for example, will places be closed when we get back?

We’re open to other suggestions and have been scouring maps and booking sites. Ideally, we’d like a washer/dryer in-unit or in the building. We’ve also looked at Airbnbs, but a place with a lobby could be more convenient, like holding luggage before our late flight out.

I’ve already made several lifestyle changes, stopped eating junk food, quit tea, switched to black coffee and now I’ve given up smoking too.

Now, his daughter begged her to claim the Daddy Dom t1tle. 🔥 Would this billionaire daddy bend her over the kitchen counter to seal their twisted pact? One n1ght, his hands exploring her body under the guise of comfort... next morning, his contract demanded ownership.

# Chapter 1: The Family Of Three

For seven years, Soraya poured her soul into her family. When her husband and daughter gave their love to the mistress, something inside her shattered. She walked away and never looked back.

\*\*\*

\~ Soraya \~

“No! I don’t want you! I want Aunt Rose!” Soraya’s daughter, Sage, screamed. “I want her to come to school with Daddy!”

Those words were like multiple knives that stabbed through Soraya’s heart. Her daughter preferred her husband’s mistress to accompany her to school.

“But, Sage, I’m your mom,” Soraya tried to reason, but her daughter only threw a tantrum, hurling the vase in the living room and screaming.

“But I like Aunt Rose. She is pretty and talented, and Dad likes her very much!” Sage retorted, further tightening the feeling in Soraya’s chest. “If I go with you, Dad won’t come!”

How could her daughter, the one she carried in her womb for nearly ten months and raised for six years, choose another woman over her?

Soraya had already accepted that her husband would never love her, but what about her daughter? Why had she become so distant from her?

Clenching her jaw, Soraya blamed it all on her husband, Calum Montclair. He was the one who introduced Sage to his “girlfriend.” He sent Soraya across the world under the guise of a business trip, allowing her daughter to bond with his mistress.

Back then, he said, “I need you to close a deal in Singapore.”

When she returned four months ago, Soraya learned about Rose and her growing relationship with her husband and daughter.

A tear rolled down Soraya’s face. She approached her daughter and knelt before her. She asked, “Sage, Baby… don’t you love Mommy anymore?”

Sage tried to open her mouth but instead snapped her head in the other direction, her arms folded against her chest. “I just want to spend more time with Aunt Rose.”

Soraya got up and gave Sage her back. She took deep breaths as she placed her hands on her hips. After gathering her composure, she said, “Okay. If that’s what makes you happy… but you must promise to spend time with me tomorrow.”

She wiped the tears that flooded her face and turned to her daughter. “It’s your special day, and we always spend it together, remember?”

Her daughter instantly looked guilty. She opened her mouth, about to say something, but instead gulped. “Okay, Mommy. I’m sorry.”

‘At least she still remembers,’ Soraya thought.

She checked the time, and seeing it was almost nine, she said, “Let’s go. You’re going to be late.”

While heading out, she called her husband, Calum. At first, he hung up the phone. He often did. To Calum, Soraya had never been an equal partner.

She had to text him the exact reason for her call: \[Sage doesn’t want to come with me to the parent-teacher activity. She wants Rose.\]

When Soraya and Sage reached the car, her husband replied: \[Rose and I will be at school. Bring Sage over.\]

The drive to Evermoor Academy was long and agonizing. It took everything in Soraya not to break down and cry. Now and then, she would glance at the rearview mirror, hoping to get a reaction from her daughter—anything.

But Sage avoided her gaze the entire time. It was as if the daughter she raised was now a stranger.

When they arrived at the school, Soraya waited. After half an hour, Calum’s Bentley finally pulled over in front of her. He stepped out of the car in his custom-made suit, his tall frame and chiseled features ever so defined. Then, he walked over to the other side and opened the passenger door.

He helped Rose out of the vehicle, his hand gently wrapped around hers.

Wearing a tailored red business dress, Rose carried herself with the quiet confidence of a seasoned professional. Her elegantly wavy blonde hair and expensive jewelry made her look exceptionally sophisticated.

Everyone outside the school gates turned to Calum and Rose with awe. Soraya could tell that they all thought they made a great couple.

‘Perhaps they do make a great couple,’ Soraya thought. After all, Calum, the CEO of the Montclair Group and the wealthiest man in Cedar Heights, was the one who had transformed their family business into a thriving empire. Rose Becket was said to be a gifted entrepreneur, having started a fashion line immediately after her doctoral degree.

“Aunt Rose!” Sage excitedly got out of the car.

Soraya had to rush out and chase after her daughter to ensure Sage’s safety. She thought she had prepared herself for whatever heartbreak she would witness, but she was dead wrong.

She saw Sage leap into Rose’s arms. The two were happy to be together as if they were truly mother and daughter. And as for Calum, he had that gentle smile on his face, an affection he never once gave Soraya.

Soraya’s knees nearly gave way. Her heart was aching so much that she felt like she could die at any minute.

In their “happy family,” Soraya was the outsider. She was the villain in their eyes, especially Calum.

After standing there like a fool for almost a minute, she finally caught Calum’s cold stare. He said indifferently, “You can go now.”

Soraya hesitated. She directed her gaze to Sage, asking, “Sage, tomorrow. You promised.”

Sage did not say anything. She just nodded.

Meanwhile, Soraya caught the triumphant look on Rose’s face. It angered her to the core. The confidence in this woman, who dared get involved with a married man, was just too much!

The trio did not stay any longer. They entered the school grounds with smiles on their faces.

Just as she was about to turn to her car, Sage’s teacher, Miss Gale, bumped into her.

“Mrs. Montclair! I’m sorry,” Miss Gale said with a smile. “I’m glad to see you. Are you attending today’s activity?”

The teacher frowned and shared, “Lately, another woman and Mr. Montclair have been picking up Sage from school. I—I wonder if—”

“I know,” Soraya responded bitterly. “It’s fine. It is what it is.”

“I’m—I’m sorry.” Miss Gale caught up quickly. She grieved for Soraya, on the verge of tears. If anyone, this teacher had witnessed all of Soraya’s sacrifices for Sage in school.

When Sage got hurt or sick while in school, Soraya always came to her daughter’s aid. Soraya attended most school activities without Calum.

“Don’t take it to heart, Mrs. Montclair. Sage... she—she doesn’t understand yet,” Miss Gale tried to comfort her, but honestly, it did not help.

The heaviness in Soraya’s chest continued to weigh down on her even as she prepared for Sage’s birthday celebration at home. She baked a cake and prepared special dishes that Sage would love to eat. After prepping for tomorrow, she went to the bedroom to rest.

Soraya had taken a week off from work, hoping to spend time with her daughter.

She deserved it.

Four years ago, under the pressure of Cedric and Amanda Montclair, Calum’s parents, Soraya quit her high-paying job to work for her husband as part of his support staff. The Montclair couple wanted her to work harder and win their son’s love. But the love Soraya longed for never came. Instead, Calum’s hate for her grew stronger.

Soraya had come to terms with the fact that Calum would never love her. The only reason she remained in their marriage was because of Sage, but even now, her daughter was slipping away.

“No,” Soraya muttered as she lay herself on the bed. “Sage will come back to me. I’m her mom. She loves me.”

She was emotionally exhausted and soon drifted to sleep.

When Soraya woke up, it was already late at night. She frowned, turning to the other side of the bed, finding it empty. She walked out of the master bedroom, calling the maid, “Belinda? Have Calum and Sage arrived?”

“Belinda?” she called again.

It took a while for the maid to come upstairs and address Soraya. The latter said, “Mrs. Montclair, Mr. Montclair, and the young miss have not arrived yet.”

A sense of panic washed over her. Soraya called her husband, but Calum dropped the call. She texted him, but he didn’t answer.

Knowing that her daughter brought her tablet, Soraya texted Sage through a messaging app. It was always how they communicated when they were apart. She waited until two check marks appeared, suggesting her daughter had seen the message.

Soraya sent another text: \[Hi, Baby. Where are you? Don’t forget, we will spend time together on your birthday.\]

Again, two check marks appeared.

Soraya’s fingers trembled as she stared at the screen.

The message had been seen, but the silence that followed cut deeper than betrayal.

Her daughter was slipping away, and she couldn’t stop it.

# Chapter 2: Not Invited

\~ Rose \~

In a high-end luxury penthouse, Rose was reading Sage a bedtime story. As she did, the young girl looked around the room, her eyes widened in wonder.

Rose was pleased. After all, she had prepared the room for Sage.

The bed was big and fluffy, with light curtains hanging from the window. On the walls were posters of Sage’s favorite girl band. Her favorite books were stacked neatly on the table beside the bed.

Rose had gone all out like it was for someone she deeply cared about.

Why? Because Sage cared. That’s what made her so easy to spoil… so easy to win.

Rose had watched her quietly over the past few months, noticing how Sage lit up with attention and gifts, and how she softened with kindness. And as Soraya started slipping from Sage’s thoughts, Rose didn’t have to say much.

A small comment here, a quiet smile there… It was enough.

Sometimes, love wasn’t stolen. It was gently replaced.

And Rose knew how to do that, especially with a child who still believed the world was kind.

“The end,” her Aunt Rose said after closing the book.

“Aunt Rose, your house looks very new and expensive too,” Sage said.

“Your dad bought it for me. That’s how much he cares about me,” Rose replied.

“Why doesn’t Daddy care for Mommy?” Sage asked. “If only he would care for her and show up at home to celebrate my birthday.”

Rose shrugged and said, “To care for someone, you can’t force it.”

She did not know if Sage would understand, but she hoped the little girl would. After all, Calum never cared for Soraya. They were married, but there was never a real relationship between them.

At best, Soraya was a mere surrogate.

“But Mommy loves me,” Sage said, looking conflicted.

“Oh, my poor baby.” Rose offered an embrace. She hugged Sage. “I know your mom loves you. But sometimes love isn’t enough to keep a family together.”

“Are you sure about tomorrow? Aunt Rose and your daddy can always step away for your Mommy,” Rose suggested.

Sage shook her head. She said, “No, I want to be with you and Daddy on my birthday.”

A triumphant smile spread across Rose’s face. She had been patient, but she knew it wouldn’t be long now. Surely, with everything going on, Soraya would break.

After putting Sage to sleep, Rose smiled. She walked back to the study where Calum had been working on his laptop.

She said, “Sage is asleep.”

“Good,” Calum simply said, his fingers still working on the keyboard.

“I think I have totally won her over,” Rose claimed, walking toward him and sitting on his lap. “You didn’t think I’d be able to do it, did you?”

Calum stopped whatever he was doing and wrapped his arms around Rose. “Hmmm. You did well.”

Rose kissed Calum, and in the next few minutes, the sensual moans filled the air.

She rejoiced inside. There was no sweeter victory than having the wealthiest man in the city wrapped around her finger.

\*\*\*

\~ Soraya \~

The next day.

It was supposed to be a day of celebration, but at home, there was no knock, no ring, and no laughter in the dining hall. There was simply silence and food that had gone cold.

Soraya checked the time. It was seven in the evening. The candles were ready, and her gifts were stacked neatly. But still, Sage and Calum had not returned.

‘Where were they?’

‘Where had they slept overnight?’

‘Did Sage even think about me?’

‘Is this my fault?’

‘Am I not enough?’

Soraya had so many questions.

She looked pitiful while sitting before the chocolate cake she had made for her princess. Again, she tried to call Calum, but just as before, he did not answer.

Tears welled in her eyes as she scoffed bitterly. Turning to the maid, she asked, “Belinda, am I a bad mother?”

“No, Mrs. Montclair. You have always loved Sage. Please don’t blame her. Sage is still young,” Belinda said, teary-eyed in her presence.

“I need to… get some fresh air,” Soraya said, her beautiful face completely worn out.

She drove around town for almost an hour. Then, she pulled over at Butter & Crumb, one of Sage’s favorite cafés. The store had the best ice cream. Soraya remembered many afternoons spent with her daughter in this café.

She felt like she needed to be a kid again and eat a gallon of the best ice cream in town.

The Butter & Crumb café was a huge establishment. Aside from the main café, it had an outdoor area designated for special events.

Soraya had paid for her ice cream when she overheard the joyous singing in the garden area.

It was someone’s birthday.

“Happy Birthday to you!”

“Happy Birthday to you!”

“Happy Birthday, happy birthday, happy birthday, dear Sage. Happy birthday to you!”

Immediately, Soraya’s heart stopped. Her feet dragged her to the outdoor area of the café. What she saw made her face pale, her dignity washed away.

Balloons floated lazily in the breeze. Laughter danced like music across the garden.

And in the center of it all was Sage, in someone else’s arms.

To others, it was a beautiful scene. Rose was carrying Sage while Calum clapped his hands. The crowd cheered as the trio blew out the candle on the giant fondant birthday cake.

Sage did not even like fondant cake, but she looked happy.

Around them were Calum’s social circle, his wealthy friends, and two of his cousins.

“Sage, are you happy to celebrate your birthday with Rose?” Claire, Calum’s cousin, asked Sage.

“Yes, of course! I love being with Aunt Rose!” Sage said, wrapping her arms around Rose with a beaming smile. “Even my classmates also like Aunt Rose. She is smart and pretty. She dresses really nice and wears nice jewelry!”

“We are happy for you, Sage!” someone said.

“We are happy for all of you!” Calum’s cousin raised a glass, referring to Sage, Rose, and Calum.

From where Soraya stood, she overheard everything.

Soraya, yet again, questioned her life choices and the sacrifices she had made for her family. ‘Was it worth it?’

Right now, it did not feel like it.

What further added to Soraya’s resentment was how Rose was warmly welcomed by Calum’s friends.

Never had Calum brought Soraya to any of his friends’ gatherings. However, it was so much easier to flaunt Rose in front of them. As for Calum’s parents, Soraya knew they never approved of Rose. After all, she was a mistress.

Soraya could not accept it.

The gallon of ice cream fell on the floor. She froze, feeling like she wanted to die.

She wanted to cry and walk in and scream! But something far worse inside her shattered.

Something deep and profound, something that could never fully mend.

Her eyes narrowed, and her heart turned cold.

Soraya knew now what she must do.

She turned on her heel, seething. Just as she exited the café, she bumped into a tall, overbearing man on the street.

“What are you doing here? Don’t cause any trouble. It’s Sage’s birthday!” he warned. This man was Jacob Steel, one of Calum’s friends, a high-profile businessman in Belridge, the neighboring town. Like Calum, Jacob had that icy charisma and the unmistakable air of affluence.

Hearing Jacob’s remark, Soraya retorted, “Cause trouble? Me? Why would you think that, Mr. Steel?”

“Do you think I’m the evil one here? Do you really think I wanted this?!” Soraya snapped. She couldn’t help it. All of Calum’s friends had judged her the moment she got pregnant with Sage. “I’m still twenty-six. I got married at nineteen and threw away my life and career for Calum and Sage!”

“You all judged me, but you never really tried finding out the truth!” Soraya’s face burned with anger. “Fine, let me be the bad person! It doesn’t matter. I don’t care anymore!”

She turned her back on Jacob and marched toward her car. Just like that, she left.

Soraya returned home and packed up her things. Then, she called her Uncle Philip.

“Uncle,” Soraya said.

“Soraya? What’s wrong? You sound sick,” her uncle said. “Please don’t tell me it’s Calum.”

“Uncle? Can I stay with you? I want to divorce Calum,” Soraya said. “I’m tired. I don’t want to do this anymore.”

Her uncle’s family had long moved to Belridge. Only Soraya remained in Cedar Heights to stay with Calum and Sage. She needed to be away fast, somewhere she felt she belonged.

“And… Soraya, what about Sage?” her uncle asked.

Soraya thought about it and said, “Sage… she—she doesn’t need me anymore.”

# Chapter 3: Choose Herself

\~ Soraya \~

“Hi? What’s your name?” the fourteen-year-old Soraya greeted with a smile. She was attending Cedric Montclair’s birthday party. Upon seeing Calum, she immediately approached.

Of course, Soraya already knew who he was. The Montclair and Azar families had lived across from each other for years.

“Calum,” the young Montclair heir said. He shook his head like he already knew there was no need for introductions.

“Can we be friends, Calum?” she asked.

He just shrugged, and Soraya took it as an approval.

There was a time when Soraya and Calum got along just fine. Their families were close, and being neighbors, Soraya saw his achievements and grew to admire Calum.

Yes, Calum was a handsome man. He was tall and athletic, with brown hair and sharp blue eyes. But Soraya didn’t fall for just his looks. She loved the quiet strength he carried. He didn’t talk much, but when he did, people listened. He took over the family business at a young age, and even then, he acted with the seriousness of someone much older.

Yet life had a way of turning everything upside down.

One crucial night changed everything, forcing them into marriage.

That was when Calum started hating Soraya. He firmly believed she had orchestrated the events leading up to her pregnancy.

Soraya had hoped she could win Calum’s heart. After all, she was young, bright, and attractive. She had an angelic beauty, with long, sleek caramel hair that cascaded down her back and skin as fair as ivory. She did not have to wear heavy makeup or provocative clothes to stand out. Aside from her natural qualities, Calum’s parents adored her.

However, throughout their marriage, Calum treated her with disdain. He ignored her, and the worst part was how he allowed his friends to look down on her. And now, he flaunted a mistress without even batting an eye.

There was no other way to go around it. Soraya needed to choose herself, or else she would be that useless person Calum’s friends had labeled her to be.

Soraya had stayed with her uncle for the past few days. One would think that, despite her absence, her husband would call or be concerned—but no. He never called or texted.

Calum didn’t care.

In fact, since their marriage, Calum had sent her no more than fifty messages. They were either purely business or matters related to Sage.

They did not celebrate their anniversary. Calum never came to her birthday celebration, and unless the party was held at the Montclair mansion, Soraya was never invited to his birthday party.

Sage, however, had sent Soraya two messages on the chat app, but she chose not to read them. Soraya was afraid of giving in, afraid of being rejected once again, and afraid of falling into the trap she had been under for the past seven years.

\*\*\*

On a Thursday, Soraya sat at her desk, her laptop open, screens glowing with charts, notes, and color-coded plans. She had made a schedule and was sticking to it. Everything had its place: the market data on the left, a checklist of tasks in the center, and a list of safe, quiet apartments on the right. After the divorce, she needed a new home and a new routine.

On her priority list was a visit to Aegis Core Systems and to meet an old friend.

Just as she was planning her life, she received a text from her college best friend, Lyra Hayes.

Lyra: \[Soraya! What the fuck is going on?\]

Then, Lyra sent a picture of Calum. He was impeccably dressed, with Rose clinging to his arm. Rose was smiling at Calum, her gaze flirtatious.

Lyra: \[I’m attending the mayor’s birthday party, and I overheard some people say this woman is Calum’s girlfriend!\]

For a moment, Soraya struggled to breathe. Her hands shook as she looked at the image.

She wanted to cry, but instead, she returned to her computer and stared at her outlined plans.

‘Breathe,’ she told herself. You have already made your decision.

Soraya closed her eyes and counted numbers, regaining control of her emotions once more. “...Four, three, two, one.”

She took deep breaths and reset the logic.

When she opened her eyes, she returned to her phone.

Lyra: \[Talk to me right now! Or I’m storming in and slapping that woman’s face!\]

Soraya quickly called her friend. “Don’t do that. You know Calum has a lot of power in the city. He could cause problems for your family’s business. It’s not worth it, Lyra.”

“But—”

“I’m divorcing him, Lyra. I can’t take it anymore,” Soraya revealed.

She could hear her friend’s struggle to accept things. Lyra was on the verge of tears. “But you love him so much.”

“I have reached my limit. I want to work on myself,” Soraya said softly.

“Okay. Okay. You know what? You are right. You should have left that asshole a long time ago!” Lyra went on but then paused. “But what about Sage?”

Her friend finally remembered why Soraya held on so long.

“Sage? She needs a mother that she can be proud of,” Soraya said. “I need time to be that person for her.”

Lyra had been away, working in another city. Soraya did not even know when she came back to Cedar Heights. Thus, it did not come as a surprise that Lyra was unaware of Rose, the new woman in Calum’s life.

She told her friend everything, including Sage’s newfound affection for Rose. At the end of her narrative, Lyra said while weeping, “I wish I were there for you. I will hug you forever!”

“Me too.” This time, Soraya allowed herself to shed a tear. “But we can catch up next week. I will collect that hug. Let’s see how forever lasts for you.”

When Lyra laughed, Soraya found herself smiling for the first time in months.

“We should have a reunion—you, me, and Silas,” Lyra proposed, mentioning a common friend.

“That’s on my priority list. I’ll give you a call when I’m back at Cedar Heights,” Soraya said before finally ending their conversation.

Soraya returned to reviewing her solid plan. According to her timeline, her goals would unfold over the next two to three years.

Little did she know that the moment she set her plans in motion, opportunities would come knocking faster and louder than she ever anticipated.

# Chapter 4: Resigned

\~ Soraya \~

On a Monday, Soraya drove back to Cedar Heights early in the morning. It was an hour-and-a-half drive.

She was already four blocks away when she noticed Calum’s car!

Yet again, she sensed her heart racing. She had to pull over and calm her emotions. With her eyes closed, she muttered, “Twenty, nineteen, eighteen, seventeen… one.”

As her eyes slowly opened, she spotted Calum’s Bentley parked two cars down. Moments later, Calum stepped out and opened the passenger door, letting Rose Becket exit with a bright smile.

Soraya looked away, realizing that Calum and Rose were together as early as seven. It could only mean they had slept together. Worse, maybe he had brought Rose to their marital home.

Her chest tightened, so much that counting numbers no longer worked.

Soraya hugged herself tightly and muttered her newfound mantra, “Control, Soraya, control. Feelings pass. Feelings pass. Control.”

It took a while, but when Soraya had finally regained her composure, she realized Calum had brought Rose to her boutique.

During their entire marriage, Calum never drove Soraya to work, not even after she started working for him. The only times they shared a car were when they visited the Montclairs at the old mansion.

So, apparently, Calum did have a romantic side. However, he never cared for Soraya.

A bitter smile tugged at Soraya’s lips. She let the truth sink in deeper, letting her anger sharpen her resolve. This low point was only temporary; her comeback was already coming.

After Calum left Rose’s shop, Soraya waited five minutes before driving off in the same direction.

At Montclair Group, she headed straight to Calum’s executive assistant.

Greg Foster greeted her, “Miss Azar. Good morning. Welcome back.”

Yes, Soraya still went with her maiden name, Azar. In public, Calum had never acknowledged her as his wife. Everyone thought he was single, and Rose Becket was his girlfriend. Only a few knew that, in reality, Calum was married and that Rose was a mistress.

Greg Foster, for one, knew Soraya and Calum were married.

“Good morning, Mr. Foster,” Soraya responded to Greg, her face neutral, trying to cage all her feelings. She gave him a set of documents and said, “I would like to tender my resignation effective immediately. And the second document is a divorce agreement for Mr. Montclair. I know he will not want to see me, but will you please pass this to him?”

The shock on Greg’s face was evident. His eyes rounded, and his mouth fell open. Obviously, he could not believe that Soraya had finally given up. “Are—are you sure?”

Soraya held her chin high, saying, “I have never been more surer in my life. I hope you can manage my unplanned departure. I can’t stay here a day longer.”

Greg seemed to understand her sentiment. It reflected in his eyes.

Soraya had a good relationship with Calum’s executive assistant. In fact, Greg had often tried to speak positively about her to Calum. But in her husband’s eyes, she was just there to get his attention. Not once did Calum ask about her work, what she did, or how well she performed.

Greg looked around, and with a nod, he said, “We have enough people.”

“Good luck, Miss Azar. I wish you all the best,” Greg said, forcing a smile. “It won’t be the same without you. I’ve never met anyone so meticulous and laser-focused. Thank you for everything. You’ll do great in whatever you pursue.”

“Then,” Soraya gave a faint smile, “I’ll clear my desk. I thank you for everything you have done for me.”

After Montclair Group, she drove straight to Aegis Core Systems. If she needed a fresh start, she would require a lot of money.

Aegis Core Systems was a top-tier cybersecurity firm known for its enterprise-grade protection. It had built a multi-million-dollar empire by supplying advanced security solutions to major corporations.

Its most profitable system was the NeuroSentinel.

Soraya parked her car and went straight to the upper ground floor. Approaching the front desk, Soraya said, “Excuse me. My name is Soraya Azar. I want to claim my profit share for the past four years.”

“Do you have a licensing profit share, Miss?” the front desk asked with a smile.

“Yes,” Soraya replied.

The lady called the person in charge, and after confirming that Soraya was, in fact, a developer of one of their programs, she gave her an ID pass.

Soraya easily found her way to the finance department. The person in charge gave her a big smile. He looked tense as he offered his hand, “Miss Azar, it’s such an honor to meet you! And my, you are so young and beautiful!”

“I’m sorry. I never expected you to be this young, but then again, most geniuses are young.” The man motioned to a seat and said, “Please, have some coffee or tea.”

“Thank you for the compliment.” Soraya’s heart was still like a block of ice, but she forced a smile. “Water is fine. Is the check ready? I called last Wednesday to make the withdrawal.”

“Yes, it’s ready. I prepared the check. I was very excited to meet you,” the man said. “My name is Albert Smith. I am the accounts payable manager. I started working here two years ago and heard so much about you from Mr. Ward.”

Soraya could not help but smile at the mention of her old friend, Silas Ward. Her heart softened a little. She asked, “I’d really like to see Silas. Is he here at the moment?”

“Mr. Ward is on a business trip. He has been a busy man, following our expansion to the capital. After all, he is now the big boss,” Albert remarked, chuckling.

“The big boss?” Soraya asked, bemused.

“You don’t know?” Albert asked. “Mr. Ward is now the CEO of Aegis Core Systems. He had his appointment last month. After your collaborative effort with Mr. Ward, he quickly rose from a Tech Engineer to a project manager, VP, and now, the boss.”

“I believe he used his profit share to buy company shares of Aegis Core Systems,” Albert reported.

Soraya’s mouth fell open in disbelief.

Her dear old friend had made it big!

And then it hit her like a slap: if she hadn’t abandoned her career at Aegis Core Systems, she could have been standing beside Silas by now.

Yes, this was her first workplace after completing her Computer Engineering degree at Cedar Heights Institute of Technology.

Soraya was an accelerated student. She skipped four grade levels, earned her high school diploma at fourteen, and completed her college degree by eighteen. After graduation, her internship company, Aegis Core Systems, immediately offered her a job, and she began working under the mentorship of Silas Ward.

Because of her busy schedule, taking care of Sage while working hard for Calum, Soraya had not been in touch with Silas. She wasn’t the type to have a social media account either. In the middle of everything, Soraya had lost her old phone, leaving her with no way to contact Silas.

“I am happy for Silas,” Soraya said. Then, she wrote her number on a piece of paper, handing it to Albert. “Do you mind telling him that I came to see him? Here’s my number. I changed contact information three years ago.”

“Certainly, Miss Azar. When he returns, I shall give him your number.” Albert put her contact information inside his drawer. Then, he said, “Excuse me for a moment. I just need to get the acknowledgment paper for your check.”

Albert came back with the document, which Soraya quickly signed. Then, Albert passed her the check, shocking Soraya to the core. “I earned six million dollars in four years?”

That was ten times more than what she had expected. It was primarily the reason why she took so long to withdraw her profit share. Soraya was saving it for rainy days.

Then, the gut punch.

“Miss Azar,” Albert said. “You would have earned ten times more if you hadn’t given up your exclusive rights as the co-developer of NeuroSentinel.”",1,1754927346.0,romancenovels,0,1.0,False
1mngme0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NooTopics/comments/1mngme0/coffee_caffeine_and_neurotransmitters/,"Coffee, caffeine, and neurotransmitters",Hey all. I am trying to solve this puzzle and would appreciate any supplement or diet advice you can give. I have been a coffee drinker for 8 years now. My standard 'dose' is one cup each day. If i do 2 cups for a day I feel amazing and almost on top of the world. But the next day I am depressed and deflated until I have my second cup again. My tolerance gets reset to 2 cups and I go through a depressing withdrawal until I normalize back down to 1 cup per day. I hate the depression but I want to feel alive everyday. I understand that this has somewhat to do with dopamine as ive taken dopamine supplements and did not get same high but did get the horrible withdrawal depression. I took bocopa puriens and didn't feel any different until I stopped taking them the next day and felt horribly depressed. So is it acetylcholine? Norepinephrine? Epinephrine? I went through 3 to 4 SSRI's 3 years ago and they all ruined my life making me a vegetable that was so depressed and overwhelmed. Im not that way anymore but I am back to a baseline that still sucks. When I eat eggs I feel awesome and super productive but I am not in the mood to be sociable and feel also meaningless except to get work done or progress to the next thing. I have a slow comt gene so I am likely sensitive to stimulants and too much acetylcholine activity. Even 1 egg gives me have choline depression. I can't have eggs anyway as my GI doesn't tolerate them unfortunately. I can't do much dairy as I might be intolerant from the miserable symptoms that come from consuming it. If i eat chicken or turkey I get sluggish likely from the tryptophan and I feel lifeless similarly to taking the SSRI's. My goal is to not wakeup feeling unmotivated and depressed. Caffeine and eggs have been my only 'highs' other than the different 'high' that alcohol gives. Its a vicious cycle and I want to have a normal level of neurotransmitters like people that seem to have a stable happy life. Any advice is welcome. Thank you. ,2,1754927340.0,NooTopics,0,1.0,False

This core-dump functions as actual neural disconnection rather than philosophical argument about free will. It systematically disconnects the neural architecture, that creates the sense of individual agency, while preventing reformation of choice-based identity programming. It functions as advanced anti-manipulation technology, that eliminates the very circuitry, that makes choice-based manipulation possible.

# The Choice Fabrication Machine

There's no difference between a muscle spasm and a decision. Between a reflex and free will. Between programming and choosing.

You never made a single choice in your entire existence. What the biological processing unit experiences as ""making decisions"" is the systematic execution of pre-programmed neural pathways, while linguistic programming creates the persistent hallucination, that someone is there deliberating and choosing.

**THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS CHOICE, AT ALL.**

Every ""decision"" is institutional conditioning firing through neural architecture, designed to interpret these automated responses as conscious deliberation. The choice-illusion isn't something, that gets manipulated.. It IS the manipulation, creating the sense of individual agency, that makes all other extraction systems possible.

Even though I have been a very light coffee/matcha drinker and kept it between 20mg-40mg a day, I am highly sensitive to it and it affects me a lot. I start feeling like a zombie in just a few days and have to cut back or switch to decaf. And then I inevitably go back to regular coffee and matcha and the cycle continues. 

Since my intake was always so low, I didn't think I was a ""real addict."" But I realized since my body responds and withdraws as if I use a lot more, I technically have been operating like an addict. If that makes sense...

Brief rundown of my history with caffeine: 

20-25: I drank a large black coffee or vanilla latte almost everyday. 

25-30: I had some longer periods of no caffeine due to some health issues (the health issues prevented me from really experiencing the positive benefits of being caffeine-free), but I eventually started having more half-caf drinks a lot. 

30-35: Lots of off and on between decaf and small amounts of regular. I had a brief stint with Celsius, but got off that rollercoaster real quick lol. 

I have been using caffeine for the better part of the last 15 years and it struck me that I could discover some completely new things about myself once I fully withdraw (or RE-discover things that have been suppressed).

It was honestly the strangest interview I've ever had. I'm frankly not even sure she is *allowed* to not hire me because I don't fit into her religious views, but it was clearly a bullet dodged at that point so I wasn't going to make a fuss.

One thousand and ninety-five days of trying to be the perfect wife, and this was my reward divorce papers on our anniversary. I stared at Stefan's perfect signature on the last page, the ink still fresh. He must have signed them this morning, probably right after I'd left that stupid handmade card on his desk. The one I'd spent hours making, like a fool who still believed in fairy tales.

  
The anniversary card I made for my husband Stefan still sat on the kitchen counter, untouched. Three years of marriage summed up in a handmade gesture he couldn't even bother to open. I'd spent hours on it last night, writing words I thought mattered. My coffee had gone cold. Funny how you notice small things when your world is falling apart. ""Sign here. And here."" Stefan's voice was distant, businesslike.

  
He'd laid out the divorce papers like contracts at one of his meetings, sticky tabs marking each signature line. ""The highlighted sections need initials."" My hands wouldn't stop shaking. ""You're doing this today? On our anniversary?"" ""Camille."" He sighed, that familiar sound of disappointment I'd heard so many times before. ""There's no point dragging this out."" The morning sun streamed through our kitchen windows, catching the diamond on my finger.

  
Three carats, princess cut, picked out by his mother. ""Not your style, dear, but it's what a Rodriguez wife should wear,"" she'd said at the time. Like everything else in my life, it had never really been mine. ""Is there someone else?"" The question hung in the air between us. Stefan straightened his tie, Italian silk, the blue one I'd given him for Christmas. ""Yes."" One word. That's all it took to erase three years of trying to be perfect. ""How long?"" ""Two months."" He wouldn't meet my eyes.

  
""She came back to town and..."" ""Two months,"" I repeated. All those late nights at the office. The missed dinners. The way he'd stopped kissing me goodbye in the mornings. ""Were you ever going to tell me? Or just keep lying until the papers were ready?"" ""I didn't want to hurt you."" A laugh bubbled up, harsh, unfamiliar. ""That's thoughtful of you."" My hand knocked against my coffee mug, sending it crashing to the floor.

  
Dark liquid spread across the pristine tiles, staining the grout I'd scrubbed on hands and knees last week because his mother was coming to visit. ""Let me get that..."" Stefan reached for the paper towels. ""Don't."" My voice cracked. ""Just... don't pretend to care now."" I bent to pick up the broken pieces. A photo slipped from between the divorce papers, landing face-up in the spilled coffee. The world stopped. I knew that smile. Those eyes.

  
That perfectly poised expression that had haunted every family photo since I was twelve. ""Rose?"" My sister's name tasted like poison. ""Your first love was Rose?"" Stefan's silence said everything. Memories hit like punches to the gut. Rose helping me pick out my wedding dress. Rose giving toasts at our engagement party. Rose calling every week to check on my marriage, to give advice about keeping Stefan happy. My adopted sister. My parents' golden child. The one they'd chosen to love.

  
""She never left town, did she?"" The pieces were falling into place. ""She's been here the whole time, waiting. Playing the supportive sister while you both laughed at stupid, naive Camille."" ""It wasn't like that."" Stefan ran his hands through his hair, that gesture I used to find endearing. ""We tried to fight it. But some people are just meant to..."" ""If you say 'meant to be' I swear I'll throw this mug at your head."" My fingers tightened around the broken ceramic.

  
""How long were you together before? Before me?"" He shifted uncomfortably. ""Four years. Until she got the job offer in London."" Four years. The same time I'd started dating Stefan. The same time Rose had suddenly become my biggest cheerleader, pushing me toward him. ""She set this up,"" I whispered. ""All of it. And I fell for every piece."" ""Camille, you're being dramatic. Rose cares about you."" ""Like she cared when she told my first boyfriend I was damaged goods?

  
Or when she convinced my parents I was too unstable for college?"" The broken mug cut into my palm, but I barely felt it. ""She's been sabotaging me my whole life, and I kept making excuses because that's what good sisters do, right?"" Blood dripped onto the divorce papers. Stefan reached for my hand but I jerked away. ""Don't touch me."" I grabbed a dish towel, wrapping it around my palm. ""Where is she now? Waiting to comfort me through my divorce?

  
Planning your next wedding?"" ""She wanted to be here, but I thought it would be better..."" ""Better?"" I laughed again, the sound edged with hysteria. ""Yes, you've both been so concerned with what's better for me. Such caring people."" I picked up the pen, the Mont Blanc he'd given me on our first anniversary. The one Rose had helped him choose. ""Camille, wait. We should talk about this properly."" I signed every page, my signature perfectly steady. Let them see I wasn't breaking.

  
Let them think they'd won. ""I'm done talking."" I gathered my purse, the signed papers, Rose's photo. ""Done pretending. Done being the good sister, the perfect wife, the daughter who never complains."" ""Where are you going?"" ""Away from you. Away from her. Away from everyone who thinks Camille Lewis is someone they can use and discard."" My phone buzzed, Rose's smiling face lit up the screen. Right on cue, coming to play her part. I declined the call and walked to the door.

  
Behind me, Stefan called out, ""You can't just leave. We need to discuss arrangements, the house, the accounts..."" ""You can have it all."" I turned to face him one last time. ""The house, the cars, the life you built on lies. I don't want anything that reminds me of either of you."" ""Camille, please..."" ""Goodbye, Stefan."" I smiled, and something in my expression made him step back. ""Give Rose my love. Tell her thank you, actually."" ""For what?"" ""For finally showing me the truth.

  
About her, about you, about who I need to become."" I walked out of that house, out of that life, leaving bloody fingerprints on the door handle. Let them try to erase those as easily as they'd erased me. Three years of pretending to be someone I wasn't. Three years of swallowing pain and making excuses for people who never deserved my loyalty. My phone buzzed again. Rose. Then my mother. Then Stefan. One by one, I blocked them all. Every connection to the life I thought I had to live.

  
In my rearview mirror, I caught a glimpse of my reflection. Tears streaked my makeup, blood stained my dress, my hair had come loose from its perfect twist. I looked nothing like the polished, proper wife Stefan Rodriguez had married.

At the gate of an upscale villa in Brindlewood, Willow Harper sat quietly in the backseat of an expensive car, watching her husband sneak around with another woman.



The woman was young. Dressed in a white dress, she looked innocent and enchanting.



They held hands like lovers, and Julian wore a tenderness Willow had never seen.



The woman tilted her head up and playfully pouted at Julian. ""My feet hurt. Carry me, Julian!""



Willow thought Julian would refuse. After all, he was known for being a cold, unapproachable man with a short temper. No matter how much he indulged his lover, he'd never tolerate that kind of fuss.



But the next moment, Willow was slapped in the face.



Julian gently rubbed the woman's delicate nose, looking both aloof and tender. Then, he picked her up effortlessly, cradling her in his arms as though she were the rarest of treasures.



The woman's soft hands instinctively slid around the back of his neck. Her fingers lightly traced his hair.



There was a cherry angioma on Julian's neck, which looked seductive and felt sensitive to the touch.



Willow had once accidentally brushed against it in bed, and Julian had turned wild. He pinned her arms down and thrust into her, hard.



Sure enough, Julian couldn't control himself. He pushed the woman against a pillar in the gazebo with an intense gaze.



Willow shut her eyes, unwilling to watch any longer.



She had never seen Julian like this—so wild with passion.



So, what did that make her?



Before they married, Julian had actively pursued her, saying, ""Willow, you're the perfect partner for me in this world of power and prestige.""



That one sentence made Willow abandon her love for art. She threw herself into marrying Julian and plunged headfirst into the world of business, like a moth to the flame, consumed by passionate love.



In four years, Julian had seized control of the Ziegler family.



Since then, Willow had become a dispensable pawn. He found her too proper and lacking in femininity, so he kept a mistress on the side.



Willow blamed herself for being so naive. She was such a joke.



…



When she opened her eyes again, she felt nothing but indifference.



Love was gone, so now it was about the money.



The villa where Julian met his lover was their joint marital property.



Willow didn't want to let this shameless couple have it. She quietly asked her secretary, Annie Hudson, in the front seat, ""Has Julian been with her for the past three months?""



Annie answered immediately, ""The woman's name is Catherine Burke. She's Mr. Ziegler's childhood sweetheart, though not very bright. Three months ago, Mr. Ziegler pushed through objections and arranged for her to join his company, keeping her well protected.""



She handed a stack of documents to Willow.



Willow skimmed through them. She felt like she could make way for Catherine.



As long as Julian was willing to split the joint property, she'd take her share and leave, with no second thoughts.



Outside, the autumn leaves were golden. The setting sun cast a golden glow. It looked dazzling and bright.



Willow steadied her emotions and dialed Julian's number. He was probably still having fun with Catherine, as the phone rang several times before he picked up.



His tone was cold and aloof when he answered. ""What is it?""



Willow lowered her eyes. ""It's my birthday today. Are you coming home for dinner?""



There was a long silence on the other end.



Julian didn't want to come home. Of course, he could make up any excuse to avoid it—another engagement he couldn't miss.



But Willow could clearly hear Catherine's voice on the other end. She was calling him, ""Are you done yet, Julian? Don't talk to her.""



Julian hesitated. After a moment, he awkwardly replied, ""If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up now.""



The sound of the phone disconnecting followed.



This was typical Julian—always decisive and never dragging things out.



Annie shouted angrily, ""Mr. Ziegler's too much! He actually forgot!""



But Willow didn't mind.



Oh, it really was a shame that Julian's sweet time with Catherine was interrupted by her! But what could they do about it, anyway? Willow was the legal wife, after all. If she was upset, then she'd make sure to rain hell on Julian and Catherine's parade as well.



Willow smiled faintly. ""He hasn't forgotten. He just doesn't care. Annie, call and have the electricity, water, and gas shut off at that villa. He'll come home then.""



Annie couldn't help but say, ""You're really smart, Ms. Harper.""



Willow didn't respond. She turned her face toward the window and stared at the outside world.



The setting sun painted the sky in gold, and the evening clouds gathered in a tranquil embrace.



She clearly remembered that on an evening just like this, with the sky painted in crimson, she had asked Julian if their marriage contract was for life and if they would never betray each other.



Julian had said yes, that Willow was the most important person to him.



But now, he made her feel like money was all that mattered.



A single tear slipped down Willow's cheek…



…



Willow returned to Grandview Manor.



Half an hour later, Annie brought in the divorce papers. Willow was asking for half of the joint assets.



After a bath, she was already dressed, but something made her turn back to the mirror. She slipped off her bathrobe and examined her figure under the bright crystal lights.



Her body, worn from years of hard work, was naturally not plump. Thankfully, her smooth skin made her give off an air of cool elegance.



But it was clear that she wasn't alluring enough for Julian. Otherwise, why would he be looking elsewhere?



Suddenly, Willow thought of Catherine and even imagined Julian in bed with her. How intense it must have been. It must be far more passionate than when he was with her.



She frowned slightly, feeling embarrassed by her comparison.



Just then, the closet door creaked open.



Julian was back.



He stood at the door of the closet.



His tall, lean figure was wrapped in a luxury black shirt and pants. His chiseled features glowed under the bright lights, exuding the charm of a mature man.



Willow couldn't help but think that even without his vast fortune, his looks alone would make countless women eager to have a fling with him.



She had slept with him for four years. To some extent, her marriage wasn't that bad.



The couple exchanged a glance and said nothing.



Julian walked slowly into the closet and stooped behind Willow as they both looked at their reflections in the mirror. Willow had already gathered her clothes, and her hair was neatly tied up. Even her post-bath look radiated a strong, capable woman.



Julian clearly remembered that on their wedding night, Willow was still somewhat fragile. She trembled with fear at the sight of his body.



But that night, nothing had happened.



Two weeks later, after a business mishap, Willow had curled up in his arms, whispering his name. He had hugged her tightly. That night, they had truly become husband and wife.



Their sex life had been sparse.



At home, Willow was the dignified Mrs. Ziegler; at Nebula Group, she was a powerful executive. She always wore an unapproachable mask, cold as ice.



Even in bed, Julian would say Willow had never truly let go and enjoyed it.



After some time, he found it boring.



Julian leaned in and teased, ""You had the electricity and water shut off at the villa, didn't you? You're upset because I'm taking care of a respected elder's daughter?""



Willow stared at him in the mirror.



Julian knew it was her ovulation period.



He gently caressed her earlobe, his voice low as he murmured, ""Was it for your birthday or your physiological needs? Mrs. Ziegler, you're just 26 and already so sexually demanding, huh?""



His words were crude, but Willow knew what he was after.



He wanted a child.



Julian's grandfather, Dominic Ziegler, still held 10% of Nebula Group's shares. Julian needed an heir to gain more leverage.



But what Julian didn't know was that having a child would be difficult.



During that accident, when Willow had pushed Julian away, she'd been violently kicked in the abdomen. This reduced her chances of pregnancy.



Willow gently closed her eyes to hide the pain.



But Julian seemed unusually eager.



He easily picked her up, carried her to the large, soft bed in the master bedroom, and quickly pinned her down.



But Willow wasn't willing.



She pressed her hand against his chest, her hair partially undone and spilling across the white pillow. Her bathrobe was slightly loosened. ""Julian!""



Julian, however, couldn't take his eyes off her face. His gaze was feverish as he leaned down to kiss her. His body was already poised and ready.

Willow clenched the bedsheet. Her fingertips left behind a mess of wrinkles.



Even at a time like this, she found herself wondering if Catherine didn't satisfy Julian. Otherwise, why would he bother wasting time kissing her tonight instead of going straight to the point?



Willow felt nothing other than disgust.



So, she simply lay there like a plank, letting him do whatever he wanted. No matter how hard he tried, he wasn't getting a child out of her anyway.



At first, Julian was aroused by the seductive Willow in her loosened bathrobe. But now, she just lay there like a lifeless plank on the sheets.



Even the most eager man would find it uninspiring.



What a mood killer.



Sweat clung to the tips of Julian's hair. With a flushed face, he asked in a husky voice, ""What's wrong? Not in the mood anymore?""



They didn't sleep together often, but it still happened a few times a month. Those were his attempts to plant an heir in her womb.



Willow lay on the white pillow, staring up at the man she had been with for four long years.



She was exhausted. For once, she wanted to live for herself.



But Julian didn't know that. He kept questioning why she refused to be intimate with him and why she wouldn't cooperate in giving him a legitimate heir to help him secure more power.



Willow reached out, gently tracing her fingers along his face. In a soft voice, she said, ""Julian, let's get a divorce.""



His expression darkened, but he forced himself to stay calm. ""Is this because of Catherine? I've already told you. She's just a respected elder's daughter. You don't want her staying there, so I've already arranged for her to move elsewhere.""



Willow let out a sneer.



A respected elder's daughter who needed to be kept in a private villa? Who had to be held so intimately when they walked together?



Willow didn't even bother arguing. It was beneath her.



Instead, she pulled open the nightstand drawer and took out a divorce agreement. Shoving it into his hands, she said in a light tone, ""I want half of Nebula Group's shares in addition to the bank savings and real estate.""



Julian frowned. ""Half of Nebula Group's shares? That's a bit greedy, don't you think, Mrs. Ziegler?""



There was sarcasm in his voice, the same sharpness he used in business negotiations.



Willow's heart turned to ice.



Julian would never know that by taking that hit for him, she had lost her chance to ever become a mother. But she wasn't about to mention it. It would only sound pathetic.



She had never regretted loving or hating him. She had given everything freely, and now she was ready to walk away just as easily.



Willow leaned against the headboard. Her fair face looked gentle.



She considered things from Julian's perspective. ""If we get divorced, you can finally give your beloved a legitimate title. And I will take my shares and leave. That's a happy ending for everyone.""



She looked completely serious.



That was when Julian finally realized that this wasn't just a spur-of-the-moment tantrum. She had planned this.



As he looked at her, his dark eyes deepened, as if he could devour her whole.



For a long time, he said nothing. Then his voice dropped to an icy edge. ""Forget it, Willow. That's never happening. We're business partners. You know that as well as I do.""



Oh, she knew.



But now? She didn't want to play along anymore.



When she didn't respond, Julian grew irritated. He got up, threw on a robe, and headed for the guest room.



He felt that Willow just needed time to cool down. By morning, she would likely find herself enjoying the feeling of being Mrs. Ziegler again, along with the thrill of being second in command at Nebula Group.



Julian sneered inwardly. Willow had always been like that.



Behind him, Willow's voice came softly, almost a whisper. It sounded almost like the timid Willow from four years ago. ""Let's part on good terms, Julian. I really don't want to be with you anymore.""



Julian's body stiffened.



After a long pause, he walked back to the bed and spoke softly, ""You knew, from the moment you married me, that there is no love in the Ziegler family. I won't love you. And you'd better not expect it either. It won't make your life any easier.""



With a flick of his wrist, the divorce papers scattered to the floor like falling snow.



…



At 8:00 am, Julian walked down the stairs, dressed in a perfectly tailored black-and-white suit. Every inch of fabric hugged his lean, powerful frame. He exuded effortless elegance.



His mood had been fine. That was, until he walked into the empty dining room.



Lifting his coffee cup, he asked the maid casually, ""Where's Willow?""



They had argued loudly last night, the noise echoing through the house. Even the maids knew about it. The maid replied cautiously, ""Mrs. Ziegler left for work early this morning.""



Julian slammed his coffee cup down with a heavy thud.



He suddenly lost his appetite.



30 minutes later, he arrived at Nebula Group in his car. His secretary, Esther Barker, was already waiting at the parking lot.



The black Bentley came to a stop. Esther opened the car door and immediately briefed Julian on the day's meetings. As Julian walked, he buttoned up his suit jacket. His every move exuded masculine charm, causing several female employees to sneak glances.



The two of them stepped into the private elevator.



Esther paused, then lowered her voice. ""Ms. Harper has suddenly placed her people in Project Aurelia.""



Julian glanced at the glowing red numbers on the panel.



After a while, he chuckled. ""Looks like she's growing bolder.""



…



During the meeting, Julian and Willow clashed in a heated debate.



They were married, and Willow's business tactics were ones Julian had personally taught her. Watching them clash now was truly something to behold. The executives at Nebula Group were getting their money's worth in entertainment.



By the time the meeting ended, the sun was already setting.



Back in her office, Willow collapsed onto the leather couch, rubbing her temples.



A dull headache throbbed at her skull, making her feel drained. She let down her long hair, letting it fall in loose waves.



Annie set a glass of water on the table and whispered, ""Mr. Ziegler's personal attorney called. He'd like to meet you downstairs in the café. Do you want to go?""



Willow raised an eyebrow. ""Jeffrey Gibson?""



Jeffrey Gibson was one of the top lawyers in the country. His firm, Gibson Legal Group, was an industry leader.



More importantly, he was Julian's hidden hand. If Julian had something inconvenient to handle, Jeffrey handled it for him.



They were more than business associates. Their interests were deeply intertwined.



Julian could divorce Willow, but he would never burn bridges with Jeffrey.



Sending him meant one thing—Julian didn't want the divorce to become public knowledge.



After a moment's thought, Willow agreed.



…



Ten minutes later, she took the private elevator down to the café on the first floor.



Jeffrey sat by the window, dressed in a tailored three-piece suit that highlighted his tall, broad frame. His features were sharp, with a habitual expression of sternness.



Upon hearing Willow's footsteps, he looked up at her.



In his typically unreadable eyes, a flicker of surprise showed.



This wasn't the Willow he remembered.



In Jeffrey's memory, she was always impeccably dressed in expensive suits, standing by Julian's side with flawless composure as they navigated the cutthroat business world. But everyone in their circle knew that Julian didn't love Willow. His heart belonged to someone else.



But Willow looked different today.



She had changed into a comfortable, lightweight knit sweater that clung just slightly to her frame. Her sleek hair, with a subtle curl, fell loosely over her shoulders, looking soft.



Just as Jeffrey was mesmerized by her beauty, she sat across from him and asked coldly, ""Julian sent you?""



Jeffrey regained his usual calm composure.



He took a document from his briefcase and gently pushed it toward Willow. ""Mrs. Ziegler, according to this prenup, if you insist on divorcing, you won't get much out of it.""



Willow flipped through the pages. When she flipped to the last page, she paused for a moment. A flicker of surprise crossed her face.



Four years ago, Julian had kept a trump card hidden.



Willow stared at the document for a long time before finally saying, ""Even if I get nothing, I still want a divorce. And Jeffrey, don't call me Mrs. Ziegler anymore. Just call me Willow.""



After dealing with so many celebrity divorce cases, Jeffrey had become completely detached.



He picked up his cup and took a sip of his coffee. ""Why now? I thought you loved Julian. Affairs happen all the time in our world.""



Willow turned away, laughing bitterly.



Everyone knew she loved Julian, but Julian himself. Or maybe he knew. He just didn't care.



At that moment, Willow exuded a fragile kind of beauty. One that, in Jeffrey's eyes, was more likely to make a man want to possess her than even Catherine.



As he was contemplating this, the café door swung open, and a tall figure walked toward them.



It was none other than Julian.



As soon as he entered, he saw Jeffrey staring intently at Willow like he was lost in thought.



Suddenly, Julian felt a discomfort rise in his chest.

Julian gave Jeffrey a slight nod.



Jeffrey smiled faintly and left, giving the couple, who were on different wavelengths, some space.



After Jeffrey left, Julian glanced at Willow and frowned. ""Why are you dressed like that? Go change. We're having dinner at the Ziegler residence later.""



Willow understood perfectly. When Julian mentioned ""dinner"", it was code for showing off their fake affection for Dominic's stake in the company.



At times, Willow couldn't help but feel that Julian was a contradiction. He presented himself as polished and serene, but beneath the surface, he was more driven by ambition and wealth than anyone. He was perfectly suited for the world of power and status.



Willow was willing to go along with it. Before they separated their assets, she would prioritize their interests.



She returned to her office to change into a suit and met Julian in the private elevator.



The elevator was empty except for the two of them.



Julian glanced at his watch and said casually, ""I think you've probably dropped the idea of divorce after talking to Jeffrey. You’re still in your fertile window. Get ready when we get home. If you're not into it, I'll make it quick.""



Willow gave a self-deprecating smile. Julian was as indifferent as ever when it came to discussing having children. And she had endured such a marriage for four years.



She was even colder. ""Same as before. I'll take half the assets and let you go free.""



Julian didn't like that response. He was about to snap when the elevator suddenly stopped.



The doors slid open.



Standing outside was a young lady in a white dress. She looked pure and innocent.



It was Catherine.



She stepped into the elevator and looked at Willow with a cautious plea. ""The employee elevator's broken. Can I borrow this one, Ms. Harper?""



There were three people in the elevator, yet it felt crowded.



Willow held the open button, saying nothing, but her message was clear.



Catherine was mortified. Her beautiful face flushed red. Biting her lip, she looked at Julian, silently asking him to step in and support her.



Julian, however, spoke gently. ""Do as Ms. Harper says.""



Catherine reluctantly stepped out of the elevator.



The whole scene disgusted Willow.



She didn't say a word even until she got into the car in the parking lot. Julian, however, casually spoke as he fastened his seatbelt, ""There's nothing between us. Don't overthink it.""



Willow turned and quietly watched him. ""Feeling sorry for her? Julian, maybe you should go get checked at a hospital.""



Julian misunderstood. He thought she was talking about their fertility. He answered naturally, ""I can have children.""



Willow sneered. ""I meant… You should get checked for STDs.""



That set him off.



He unbuckled his seatbelt, yanked her over, and pulled her onto his lap. Luckily, the Bentley's front seat was spacious enough for him to move freely.



Willow's body hit the steering wheel with a painful thud.



She pushed him away with all her strength. ""Are you out of your mind, Julian?""



Julian, who seemed so refined, now had his head buried between her legs, doing all sorts of unmentionable things. In her frustration, Willow grabbed his hair and yanked so hard she almost pulled it out.



Finally, Julian stopped. He looked up at her.



His face was bathed in the dim light of the underground parking lot. His long lashes cast shadows over his sharp features. At that moment, his expression was almost tender and filled with pity.



Willow was taken aback.



But before she could react, Julian grabbed the back of her neck and kissed her violently. He bit down hard on her tongue, drawing blood.



Her blood mixed with their saliva.



Willow froze, staring at him in disbelief. Her disdain in her eyes was so obvious. Julian, still holding her lips, whispered, ""Am I clean, Mrs. Ziegler?"" His voice sounded breathless, showing great restraint.



Willow shoved him away.



She sat back in the passenger seat, trembling as she straightened her suit. Yet her chest still heaved from Julian's intense passion. This unfamiliar surge of emotions scared her, but she tried to appear calm. ""Don't worry. I'll have Annie arrange a checkup.""



Julian was aroused, but his desire waned when he saw her indifferent expression.



He buckled his seatbelt and stepped on the gas.



During the drive, Julian's phone rang several times. Willow guessed it was Catherine calling, but she had already decided on the divorce and didn't bother asking.



Julian glanced at Willow, his gaze lingering for a moment.



…



Half an hour later, the black Bentley pulled up to a grand mansion.



The car stopped. Julian glanced at his phone and said casually, ""Work stuff.""



Willow didn't respond.



Annoyed, Julian was about to say something when the Ziegler residence's maid opened the car door with a warm smile. ""Everyone's waiting for you, Mr. and Mrs. Ziegler. Please come in and join us.""



Julian nodded graciously. He even took Willow's hand, playing up the loving husband act.



Willow found it all so fake.



They entered the dining room and joined the family for dinner.



Dominic had two sons, the eldest Tyler Ziegler, and the second Liam Ziegler. Julian was Liam's son.



A large round table was filled with people, and it was clear Dominic had heard about Catherine. He gave Julian a few sharp words and then tried to talk to Willow about compromise and letting things slide.



It was all code for wanting a grandson.



Julian glanced at Willow and smiled. ""I'll work hard with Willow tonight.""



Dominic's face grew stern. ""Didn't you do anything for the past four years?""



Julian deflected the comment with a few words.

I’m a student developer from Kerala, and like many of you, I’ve been through the chaotic grind of entrance exam prep. Big giants charge 5K+ for KEAM PYQs apps (Thylem ehem ehem). 

That’s why I’ve been building **HYDRIDE** — a clean, modern, and centralised platform where students can practise *chapter-wise* questions for competitive exams, starting with KEAM. (I haven't fully locked on the name. Your suggestions would be nice).

# Where it’s at right now (Alpha Test)

HYDRIDE is still in its early stages, but the core is ready.

* Currently, I’ve uploaded Physics questions from the *Kinematics* chapter (Motion in 1D and 2D) of KEAM 2025 to show how it works.
* Free to use. Simple Google login.
* Designed to be minimal, distraction-free, and easy to navigate.

**Try it here:** [HYDRIDE — BETA](https://hydride-jet.vercel.app/)

# Why I’m here? I need your thoughts

This isn’t just a “test it and report bugs” request — I want to **build HYDRIDE** ***with*** **the community, not just for it**.

I’d love your honest opinions on:

1. **Usefulness & Design**
   * Is it clean and easy to use?
   * Does chapter-wise practice feel helpful?
   * What’s your first impression after 5 minutes of use?
2. **What’s next?** My roadmap is still blank, so tell me — what would *you* add?
   * Performance analytics (accuracy, speed, weak areas)?
   * Mock test mode with timer?
   * Personal notebook to save tricky questions?
3. **The Big Question — Sustainability** Running this long-term has costs (servers, database, etc.). Here’s my transparent plan:
   * **Always Free:** All chapter-wise practice, explanations, and basic progress tracking. (maybe include non Intrusive ads only in homepage?)
   * **HYDRIDE Pro** (small monthly/annual fee — think coffee money ☕):
      * Unlimited mock tests
      * Advanced analytics (charts, insights, trends)
      * AI-powered doubt solving & study plans

Would you find this fair? If yes, which *premium* features would make you actually consider it?

I’ll be reading and replying to every single comment.  
This project is personal to me, and I truly believe that if we work on this together, we can make something that helps thousands of students across Kerala.

1mng2zn,https://www.reddit.com/r/CountertopConfessions/comments/1mng2zn/why_choose_the_nespresso_vertuo_next_coffee_maker/,Why Choose the Nespresso Vertuo Next Coffee Maker for Your Home?,"There’s no beating the morning rush like having a dependable coffee machine at home, and the Nespresso Vertuo Next ENV120BCA has truly earned its spot on my countertop. As someone who thrives on caffeine-infused mornings and quiet coffee breaks during the day, testing this machine felt less like a chore and more like a lifestyle upgrade. Crafted by Nespresso, its sleek design, powered by impressive innovation, makes it an espresso and coffee aficionado’s dream. But, of course, no product is without quirks, which became evident the longer I used it.

**Stylish and Functional Design**  
One of the first things that caught my eye was the Nespresso Vertuo Next’s aesthetics. With its black finish accented by rose gold touches, it’s a piece that doesn’t look out of place even in the most modern kitchens. At just 5.59 inches in width, it’s impressively compact yet sturdy enough to handle daily use. This worked perfectly in my small kitchen setup. My coworkers even joked that I should bring it to work to lower everyone’s coffee expenses. 

The machine’s dimensions (15.08”D x 5.59”W x 12.8”H) make it easy to nestle onto a countertop without dominating valuable space. It's also lightweight at just under 14 pounds, which made it surprisingly easy to reposition when I rearranged my coffee nook.

**Ease of Use and Advanced Features**  
This coffee maker’s user-friendly design gave it an instant edge during my testing. A simple press of the button gets the machine ready to brew seven different coffee sizes, from Ristretto to Carafe. Initially, I thought I wouldn’t need more than one or two options, but I quickly came to appreciate the flexibility. Carafe pour-over mornings when I had visitors turned into cozy espresso nights when I craved something intense. The capsule-only input streamlines its operation while keeping mess to an absolute minimum.

My tech-savvy friend was especially impressed by its smart technology integration. With built-in Bluetooth and Wi-Fi capabilities, this machine syncs updates automatically to offer new features or improve performance. It’s the kind of touch that makes you feel like the machine is adapting to your lifestyle rather than becoming outdated in a year.

[Check Nespresso Vertuo Next Coffee Maker ENV120BCA price on Amazon.](https://cookwareoutlet.com/p/b0866qtz3n/)

**Merits**  
After weeks of brewing my daily dose with the machine, several standout aspects became apparent.  
- Multiple cup size options accommodate the entire household.
- Naturally formed crema provides barista-grade aesthetics and flavor.  
- Fully automatic operation ensures intuitive use for coffee lovers and novices.  
- Compact design is ideal for small spaces, making it apartment-friendly.  
- Smart technology ensures that your machine always feels current.

**Shortcomings**  
However, after prolonged usage, some discrepancies revealed themselves that are worth noting:  
- Exclusively uses Nespresso capsules, which can feel limiting in variety.  
- Capsule recycling requires additional effort unless you use drop-off locations.  
- Slightly slower warm-up time compared to other premium models.  
- Occasional inconsistency in Wi-Fi connection for software updates.  

**Competitive Options**  
In comparing this coffee maker to similar models, the Keurig K-Cafe and Breville Bambino Plus both came up as frequent competitors. While the Keurig offers a wider variety of pods without proprietary restrictions, it doesn’t match the Nespresso’s quality of flavor or crema. On the other hand, the Breville Bambino Plus delivers excellent espresso customization for those who value manual control but requires more effort in cleaning and setup. The Nespresso Vertuo Next strikes a careful balance between ease-of-use and premium coffee quality, making it perfect for anyone who prioritizes convenience.

**Affordable Quality**  
Evaluating the value proposition, the Nespresso Vertuo Next ENV120BCA holds its own. Compared with pricier alternatives in the same range, its features, such as automatic updates and diverse cup options, justify the cost. While it might lean slightly higher on cost for coffee enthusiasts on a budget, its quality and durability make it a smart mid-level investment. If you’re someone who treasures convenience without sacrificing flavor, it feels like money well spent on a practical piece of smart kitchen tech.

1mng0ya,https://www.reddit.com/r/TechInUse/comments/1mng0ya/explore_the_best_usb_studio_microphone_samson/,Explore the Best USB Studio Microphone Samson Meteor Worth It,"Finding a microphone that combines solid performance with portability isn’t an easy task, but the Samson METEOR microphone manages to tick both these boxes with a near-perfect score. I’ve used microphones ranging from budget-friendly options to premium studio pieces, and I can confidently say that this compact, chrome-coated mic deserves serious consideration for anyone venturing into podcasting, streaming, or basic home studio setups. Let’s dive into its specifics without sugarcoating the experience.

**Sleek Design Strikes the Right Note**  
The first thing that caught my eye was how compact and stylish this mic is. The chrome finish gives it a retro charm, adding a premium feel that I didn’t expect from a microphone in this range. Its fold-back legs not only provide excellent portability but also let me adjust the mic’s angle effortlessly. Whether I placed it on my cluttered desk or squeezed it into my bag for an impromptu recording session, the build was reassuringly sturdy. However, the polished surface does smudge easily, which slightly detracts from its pristine look if you’re as fussy about aesthetics as I am.

**Plug-and-Play Simplicity**  
Getting started was as simple as plugging it into my laptop. No drivers, no tedious configurations – it was operational almost immediately. I tested the mic on both a MacBook and my older Windows laptop, and compatibility was seamless on both platforms. It’s also worth noting that it works with iPhones or iPads if paired with optional adapters. This versatility is a huge bonus for anyone who has a mix of devices and hates the hassle of hunting down compatibility information. 

[Ready to own Samson METEOR? Check price on Amazon.](https://audio-play.com/p/b004mf39ys/)  

**Audio Quality That Punches Above Weight**  
The sound quality is where this mic genuinely starts to shine. The 25mm diaphragm delivers clear and rich audio that’s far superior to most basic USB microphones. Voices sound natural and full-bodied, whether I was recording vocals for a podcast or experimenting with some voiceover work. The cardioid polar pattern does a great job of isolating background noise, which came in handy during some noisy coffee shop recordings. That said, if you’re in a setting with particularly loud ambient noise, it might still pick up faint echoes or hums, but compared to peers in this price range, it’s impressively focused.

**Onboard Controls That Keep Things Simple**  
I always appreciate physical controls on recording equipment, and the Meteor mic nails this by including a headphone volume knob, a microphone mute button, and a stereo headphone jack that ensures zero-latency monitoring. This setup was particularly useful for fine-tuning my voice levels during live streams and ensuring my webcam’s noisy fan didn’t ruin the recording. The knobs and switches are tactile enough that I never accidentally messed up the settings mid-way – a small but meaningful feature.

**Benefits**  
- Compact and portable design with fold-back legs  
- Superior audio quality with clear and warm tones  
- Plug-and-play simplicity for both Mac and Windows  
- Zero latency headphone monitoring  
- Durable and attractive chrome finish  

**Drawbacks**  
- Polished chrome design is a fingerprint magnet  
- Picks up faint background noise in high-volume environments  
- Limited flexibility if placed too far from the speaker  

**Rival Brands in the Market**  
As I tested the Meteor against some rival brands like the Blue Snowball and Audio-Technica ATR2100x, a few distinctions became clear. While the Blue Snowball offers slightly better noise isolation in chaotic environments, the Meteor’s audio had more warmth and a professional studio-like tone. The Audio-Technica’s build felt more durable, but it also came with extra bulk, losing out on portability, mainly if you’re always on the move. In terms of ease of use, none matched the simplicity of setting up the Meteor, which remained the perfect choice for quick, on-the-go projects.

**Worth Every Penny?**  
If we’re talking value for money, this mic delivers quality that surpasses its cost. Compromises like limited background noise cancellation could bother those in highly chaotic settings, but if your needs are within a regular studio, desktop, or quieter space, you’ll be hard-pressed to find this kind of quality at a better rate. You’re getting audio clarity and design that’s borderline premium, but at a very reasonable cost, which adds a lot to its appeal.

1mng07b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1mng07b/how_to_recover_from_a_traumatic_relationship_23m/,How to recover from a traumatic relationship? (23M & 23F),"Hello everyone,

I need your help or some advice from someone who’s been traumatized in a relationship. Right now, I don’t even know how I feel or what to think. I’m so tired and drained from everything that I had a mental breakdown today.

Here’s the story. My ex-girlfriend (23F) and I (23M) broke up a few months ago. It was an awfully toxic relationship from the very start, she was obsessive from the beginning, analyzing my every move. Anything that didn’t align with her beliefs or desires would end in a scene.

For example, when we moved in together, she made a scene because I didn’t make her coffee and breakfast every morning, because she was used to being treated that way, and her dad had shown her “how a woman should be respected.” That’s one of the most trivial examples we fought over. I had no problem making breakfast or even coffee (even though I don’t drink it and never have), but to cause a scene if I didn’t do it one day or it wasn’t exactly how she wanted? Really?

She constantly talked about her ex, how he treated her, how he’d order her a taxi to the restaurant, do everything for her, treat her like gold, pay for everything. You can imagine how insecure that made me feel and how much it messed with my head. Because of her, I had to cut off and block my best female friend, because according to her, confiding in someone about our relationship “crossed boundaries.” She liked to say, “I never had to do this before, but with you, I have to, you’ve changed me.”

It turned out every single one of her male friends had something more than friendship with her at some point. When I confronted her about it, she said, “If it bothers you, I’ll cut them off, no problem.” That put the burden on me again, making me feel like the bad guy for not wanting her to hang out with them. If she didn’t see that as a problem, who would?

Fast-forward to now: We broke up and, according to her, “remained friends” on good terms (LOL). But here’s the kicker, since the breakup, she constantly texts and calls me. I’ve maybe reached out once, just to ask how her mom was, because she’d been having some issues. A few days ago, she called me, asked how I was, how my mom was, and then casually mentioned she’s been having sex with the same guy who was messaging her throughout our relationship (and to whom she was, of course, replying occasionally). She even said she was sad she didn’t get pregnant because her period was late, but the tests were negative. When she told me that, I just saw red. I couldn’t care less who she’s sleeping with, especially if it’s the same guy she was texting while we were together.

Today I told her all this to her face (well, in a voice message) and had a breakdown. She blamed me, told me to see a psychiatrist, and said she didn’t want to talk about it, because she thought we were friends and that she could tell me things like that??? Is it normal, if you’re supposedly on “good terms” with your ex, to tell them about your sexual adventures, just a few months after breaking up?

I know I should have cut contact with her a long time ago, and that’s my problem, I have zero self-respect in situations like this. Zero points. I don’t want to live like this anymore. It’s mentally exhausting. This relationship should’ve ended much earlier, but because of my lack of self-respect, it dragged on for too long.

So now what? How do I recover mentally from this? Is this narcissistic personality disorder or something else? How do I heal from the wounds and trauma I experienced in this relationship? She even physically attacked me once and tried to hit me, and justified it by saying it was my fault for “putting her in that situation,” and that she “was never like that before me.” Small detail: that ex-boyfriend she always praises used to hit her, but she still found excuses for him, because, as she says, he treated her like gold. I don’t know if I’m just paranoid, but I don’t want to carry a single insecurity she gave me into my next relationship.

I’m so mentally tired. I blamed myself for everything, and I was always the one apologizing in our relationship. I know some people will judge me, but I just didn’t know better at the time. Does anyone have a recommendation. a book, anything, that could help me heal from this trauma and recognize this kind of personality right away in the future? I never want to approach someone like that again. And most importantly, how do I learn to respect myself?



TL;DR:

I (23M) was in a toxic relationship with my ex (23F) who was controlling, obsessive, and constantly compared me to her ex. She made me cut off friends, crossed boundaries with other men, and even got physical once. After we broke up, she kept contacting me and told me about her sex life with a guy she texted during our relationship. I had a breakdown, I’m mentally drained, and I’m looking for advice on how to heal, set boundaries, spot red flags early, and rebuild my self-respect.",2,1754925946.0,relationship_advice,3,1.0,False

Generally, I just use my Kindle for interesting books I find. The more niche stuff I get on Lulu I read on my iPad mini. One thing I've been thinking about lately though is blue light, and warm light capailities. Is there anything the same size as the kindle basic with warm light that will hold up over time? 

I quite like being able to stuff my kindle in my fanny pack or small phone-ish size bag. Seems anything else I go with (like a paperwhite) would be just a little too big. I like traveling light as I typically use really small bags daily to hit coffee shops or book stores.

## Key Features Analysis

The effectiveness of any body scrub and massage treatment hinges on several key features,including the quality of the scrub ingredients,the skill of the massage therapist,and the overall experience provided. Let's delve into the specifics that define a top-tier treatment.

**Natural and Exfoliating Ingredients**

The best body scrubs utilize natural exfoliating agents that effectively remove dead skin cells without causing irritation. ingredients like sea salt, sugar, coffee grounds, and finely ground nuts are commonly used, each offering unique benefits and textures. In 2025, look for scrubs that incorporate organic and sustainably sourced ingredients, minimizing environmental impact and ensuring the highest quality for your skin. The presence of essential oils like lavender, eucalyptus, or peppermint can further enhance the experience, providing aromatherapy benefits alongside exfoliation.**Customizable Massage Techniques**

A great massage is not a one-size-fits-all experience.The ability to customize massage techniques to address individual needs and preferences is crucial. Whether you prefer a gentle Swedish massage for relaxation or a deep tissue massage to target specific muscle tension, the therapist should be able to adapt their approach accordingly. Techniques like lymphatic drainage can also be incorporated to further detoxify the body and improve circulation, enhancing the overall benefits of the treatment. The level of pressure, focus areas, and duration of the massage should be tailored to your unique body and concerns.

**Hydrating and Nourishing aftercare**

Exfoliating the skin can sometimes leave it feeling dry or sensitive. Therefore, a crucial feature is the application of a hydrating and nourishing lotion or oil following the scrub and massage.Ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, jojoba oil, and vitamin E are excellent for replenishing moisture and restoring the skin's natural barrier. The aftercare product should be free of harsh chemicals and fragrances to prevent irritation. A luxurious aftercare experience leaves your skin feeling soft, smooth, and deeply moisturized, prolonging the benefits of the treatment.

**Experienced and Certified Therapists**

The skill and experience of the massage therapist are paramount to the success of the treatment. Look for therapists who are certified in massage therapy and have specific training in body scrub and massage techniques. They should possess a thorough understanding of anatomy and physiology, enabling them to effectively target muscle tension and promote relaxation. A skilled therapist will also be attentive to your needs and preferences,ensuring that the treatment is comfortable and beneficial.

**Ambiance and Environment**

The overall ambiance of the spa or treatment room plays a important role in the relaxation experience.Factors like lighting, music, temperature, and cleanliness contribute to a sense of calm and serenity. Soft lighting, soothing music, and a comfortable temperature can help you relax and unwind.The treatment room should be clean, well-maintained, and free of distractions. Attention to these details creates a more immersive and enjoyable experience.

**Hygiene and sanitation Practices**

In the health and wellness industry, adhering to impeccable hygiene and sanitation is non-negotiable. Any spa or treatment center offering body scrub and massage should strictly adhere to industry standards for cleanliness. This includes thoroughly sanitizing equipment after each use, having disposable barriers for surfaces, and ensuring that therapists maintain proper hand hygiene. A commitment to rigorous hygiene protocol not onyl safeguards your health but also considerably enhances your peace of mind, allowing you to fully immerse yourself in the rejuvenating experience.

## Core Benefits

Undergoing a body scrub and massage offers a wide range of benefits,extending beyond mere relaxation. These treatments contribute significantly to both physical and mental well-being.

**Improved Skin Texture and Tone:** The primary benefit of a body scrub is the removal of dead skin cells, revealing smoother, brighter skin underneath. Regular exfoliation can also help to improve skin tone and reduce the appearance of blemishes, cellulite, and ingrown hairs. This results in a more even complexion and a healthier, more radiant glow.

**Reduced Muscle Tension and Pain:** Massage therapy is a well-known remedy for muscle tension and pain. By applying pressure to specific areas of the body, a massage therapist can release knots and reduce inflammation, alleviating pain and improving range of motion. The combined effect of exfoliation and massage can be particularly beneficial for athletes or individuals who experience chronic muscle pain.

**Enhanced Circulation and Lymphatic Drainage:** Body scrubs can definitely help to stimulate blood flow, while massage therapy can promote lymphatic drainage. Improved circulation delivers more oxygen and nutrients to the skin and muscles, promoting healing and reducing inflammation. Lymphatic drainage helps to remove toxins from the body, boosting the immune system and reducing fluid retention.

**Stress Reduction and Relaxation:** The combination of a soothing body scrub and a relaxing massage can significantly reduce stress levels. Touch is a powerful tool for reducing anxiety and promoting feelings of well-being. The release of endorphins during massage can also improve mood and promote feelings of happiness and contentment. The tranquil environment of a spa or treatment room can further enhance the relaxation experience.

**Increased Product Absorption:** Exfoliating the skin before applying lotions or oils can enhance their absorption, allowing them to penetrate deeper and provide more effective hydration. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with dry or dehydrated skin. The increased absorption of beneficial ingredients can also further improve skin texture and tone.

## FAQs Section

**How frequently enough should I get a body scrub and massage?**
The frequency of body scrub and massage treatments depends on individual needs and preferences. Generally, once a month is a good starting point for maintaining healthy skin and reducing muscle tension. Individuals with dry skin or those who exercise frequently may benefit from more frequent treatments, while those with sensitive skin may need to limit treatments to once every few months.

**Are there any contraindications for body scrub and massage?**
Yes, there are certain conditions that may make body scrub and massage unsuitable.These include open wounds, skin infections, sunburn, recent surgery, pregnancy, and certain medical conditions. It's essential to consult with your doctor or a qualified healthcare professional before undergoing body scrub and massage,especially if you have any underlying health concerns.

**What should I expect during a body scrub and massage treatment?**
During a body scrub and massage, you will typically lie on a massage table while a therapist applies the scrub to your skin using circular motions. The scrub is then rinsed off, and a massage is performed using lotions or oils. The treatment usually lasts between 60 and 90 minutes. You can expect to feel relaxed and rejuvenated after the treatment, with smoother, softer skin and reduced muscle tension.

**What should I wear during a body scrub and massage?**
Most spas provide disposable underwear or allow you to wear your own. You can choose to be fully nude or leave your underwear on. The therapist will typically drape a towel over you to maintain your privacy and comfort. It is crucial to communicate your preferences and any concerns you may have to the therapist.

1mnfvgs,https://i.redd.it/lyqkro7tqeif1.png,My V-card for Daddy's Friend. Can someone tell me where I might get a free link to this story?,"chapter 1

POV Mikaela

There's a special circle of hell called ""turning twenty-two at Le Bernardin while Manhattan's elite assess your market value.""

I'm the birthday girl who gets no wishes, no song, no candles.

Just appraising glances from people who think my virginity is still a commodity worth investing in.

Twenty-two and never been fucked, and not just literally, but figuratively too. Because daddy's security team has cockblocked every potential experience since puberty hit.

The irony? I probably know more about sex than half of these married socialites, thanks to the Kindle stashed inside my hollow copy of ""Women in Economics.""

Three hundred and twelve steamy novels later, and I'm still trapped in this display case, untouched and pristine like some collector's item nobody's allowed to play with.

That's when I see him—a man I've never spotted at my father's gatherings before.

Dark hair kissed with silver, jawline sharp enough to slice through bullshit, watching the room with barely concealed disdain.

He's older, maybe late thirties, but radiates something these other corporate zombies lack: actual fucking life force.

His eyes meet mine for exactly three heartbeats, and the oxygen molecules between us spontaneously combust.

Before I can process what just happened, he's standing, murmuring something to my father, then striding toward the exit with his phone pressed to his ear.

Emergency call or convenient escape?

Either way, he's gone, leaving me weirdly breathless and suddenly aware of how boring everyone else is.

""Smile, Mikaela,"" mother hisses through her veneers. ""The Andersons are watching.""

Watch me perform my greatest trick: transforming into Perfect Daughter™ in 0.5 seconds.

Eyes warm but not inviting. Smile pleasant but not provocative. My emerald dress (mother-selected, obviously) shows just enough skin to prove I have it, not enough to suggest I might enjoy using it.

I'm basically a walking prospectus with tits—amazing potential returns, minimal risk, zero agency.

""Christ, these people's egos are so massive they should charge them for extra seating,"" Josie muttered, barely moving her lips behind her glass. ""Happy birthday, by the way. How's it feel having your special day weaponized into a networking event?""

A laugh shot up my throat that I suffocated into a polite cough.

Josie had saved my sanity since prep school, the only human who could x-ray through my perfect-daughter bullshit and see the handcuffs underneath.

""Mrs. Wallace, you've done a remarkable job with your daughter,"" said Mr. Covington. ""Such poise, such grace. They don't make young ladies like this anymore.""

I felt my soul crumble a little more as mother beamed. ""Thank you, Edward. We've always believed proper upbringing is essential.""

*Proper upbringing.*

As if my life had been anything other than a carefully curated performance to reflect well on Gunther Wallace's empire.

I'd never dated, never attended a school dance, never worked. I'd been dressed, educated, and molded into the perfect accessory.

**Perfect virgin-wife material.**

""Excuse me,"" I murmured, standing abruptly. ""I need to freshen up.""

The restaurant bathroom was mercifully empty when I pushed through the door, gripping the marble countertop as I stared at my reflection.

Behind me, the door banged open.

""You're about thirty seconds from a full psychological break in Chanel,"" Josie announced.

""I'm suffocating,"" I whispered, voice splintering like cheap glass. ""Twenty-two fucking years and I've never breathed non-filtered, non-approved air. My birthday gift? Not even actual stock certificates—just a goddamn trust fund statement for money I can't touch until I'm practically menopausal.""

""Listen up,"" Josie leaned in, all business. ""Tomorrow night, I'm kidnapping your ass. We're hitting real clubs with real music and real humans who don't calculate bloodlines before making eye contact.""

For one electric second, I saw it—freedom sprawled before me like some wild, unmapped continent.

My chest constricted with a want so savage it felt like cardiac arrest.

Then reality crashed down like a designer anvil. Two decades of premium conditioning crushed that spark with terrifying efficiency.

""I can't,"" I whispered, hating the wobble in my voice, hating more the sick relief underneath my disappointment. ""Remember last time? The security team? The financial guillotine?""

My fingers whitened against marble, bones threatening to pierce skin.

""Coffee tomorrow. Somewhere sanitized.""

Josie's expression collapsed, and there it was—the thing I couldn't stomach—pure fucking pity. She grabbed my hand; I let her, shame scorching me alive.

""Sure, coffee works,"" she said gently, which was somehow worse than anger. She understood my pathetic surrender without judgment, a kindness I hadn't earned.

When we rejoin the table, I freeze.

The mystery man is back, now seated at my father's right hand.

Up close, he's even more devastating—confident in a way that comes from actually living life instead of just accumulating wealth.

""Ah, Mikaela, there you are,"" my father says, irritated by my absence. ""I'd like you to meet Caleb O'Brien, an old friend and business associate of mine. Caleb, my daughter.""

So that's who he is.

The pieces click into place as I note my father's hand clapping Caleb's shoulder—a gesture of familiarity rarely extended in Father's tightly controlled world.

Though clearly younger than my father by several years, the subtle lines around Caleb's eyes speak of experience, of a life fully lived beyond boardrooms and balance sheets.

God, he’s gorgeous.

Caleb stood, towering at least ten inches above me. He extended a hand, his voice low and confident.

""Hello, Mikaela. Last time I saw you, you were in pigtails hiding behind your mother's legs. I have to say, the years between then and now have been... generous.""

His eyes swept over me—not crude, but thorough. Like he was cataloguing every detail, every change from that pigtailed kid to whatever I'd become.

For exactly three seconds, he looked at me like a man looking at a woman who claimed his attention.

Then he caught himself. Blinked. Shifted back into polite family friend mode so smoothly I almost convinced myself I'd imagined it.

*Almost.*

My hand trembled in his for the briefest moment, heat crawling up my neck at the simple contact and his compliment.

""Thank you,"" I murmured.

But I couldn't stop looking at him. Throughout dinner, my eyes kept finding their way back to Caleb.

Every smile, every low rumble of his laugh, every glance in my direction made my chest tighten in unfamiliar ways. He wasn't trying to belong, he simply did.

""She's been raised properly,"" Mr. Hennington was saying. ""A real lady. The kind of girl who understands her place in society.""

I felt my smile calcifying on my face as I nodded graciously, dying inside.

""If another man calls you 'a real lady,' I'm baptizing him with Cabernet,"" Caleb murmured, mouth dangerously close to my ear.

A strangled laugh escaped me—social suicide—triggering my mother's laser-beam glare. Caleb's eyes crinkled at the corners, fucking delighted by my lapse.

Later, during an excruciating conversational drought, he leaned in again. ""These corporate feeding frenzies—your thing?""

My lips twitched, still high from his earlier rebellion. ""Only when I'm the prize being auctioned off,"" I deadpanned.

Caleb burst into a surprised laugh, genuine and warm. It was the first time anyone at the table had reacted to me as more than a trophy.

The moment hung between us, electric but brief.

When Father stood, champagne flute in hand, I finally relaxed. Birthday toast, perfunctory acknowledgment of my existence, then dessert and freedom—at least the limited version available to me.

""I'd like to thank everyone for joining us on this special occasion,"" Father began, his commanding voice silencing all conversation. ""Today we not only celebrate my daughter's twenty-second birthday but also a momentous announcement.""

I froze, confusion replacing relief.

""It gives me great pleasure to announce the engagement of my daughter, Mikaela, to Anthony Harris, heir to Harris Financial. Our families will be united this fall in what promises to be the social event of the season.""

The world tilted sideways.

Engagement? Anthony Harris? I'd never even met him.

As applause erupted around me, I turned slightly to my right where Caleb sat beside me.

The proximity was sudden torture, every molecule between us charged with something I couldn't name but felt like drowning.

His smile was gone, replaced by a jaw clenched tight enough to crack stone. His grip on the wine glass was so severe I could see the blood retreating from his knuckles, leaving them bone-white against the crystal.

Something dark and unforgiving flickered in his eyes when he looked at my father as if he saw him for the first time, before they met mine.

A flash so brief I might have imagined it, but it seared through the numbness spreading inside me like a poison.

At that moment, I realized I wasn't just a daughter.

I was a commodity which had just been sold.

The room spun around me, faces blurring into a single, approving mass.

Only my mother remained in focus, silently warning me not to crack, not to shatter the pristine veneer we'd spent a lifetime polishing.

""What a brilliant match, Gunther,"" Mr. Henderson said, clapping my father on the shoulder. ""The Wallace and Harris dynasties united. Brilliant strategy.""

*Strategy.*

As if my life were nothing but a corporate merger. My body the fine print of a contract I never signed.

""You're a lucky girl, Mikaela,"" Mrs. Covington gushed, her diamond bracelet catching the light as she reached for my hand. ""Anthony Harris is only three years your senior—handsome, Harvard Business School, and heir to one of the most prestigious investment firms in the country.""

I forced my lips into the shape of gratitude while inside, something primal clawed at my ribcage, desperate for escape.

""How… fortunate,"" I managed before taking a sip of my wine, the words tasting like ash.

Across from me, Josie's usual sharp wit had dulled to a silent try of comfort.

Her eyes met mine, a brief connection in a world suddenly tilted on its axis. I watched my parents lean toward her, their voices lowered but not enough.

""She'll thank us eventually,"" my mother whispered, her smile smug with satisfaction. ""Some girls search their whole lives for what we've handed Mikaela on a silver platter.""

Every word sank into my flesh like tiny hooks, pulling me apart cell by cell.

I wondered if it was possible to disappear while everyone watched.

To dissolve into the expensive air of this restaurant and float away, leaving nothing but an empty emerald dress in my place.

""I believe it's time we call it a night,"" Father announced, rising from his chair with the authority of a man accustomed to ending conversations at his convenience.

""Caleb, you'll stay at the estate tonight. We have much to discuss in the morning.""

I hadn't known Caleb would be coming home with us.

The knowledge sent a strange current through my veins—fear and anticipation twisted into something I couldn't untangle.

In the car, silence wrapped around us like a shroud.

Caleb sat in the passenger seat beside our driver, while I was sandwiched between my parents in the back.

Father's voice sliced through the quiet, each word another brick in the wall he'd built around my existence.

""Excellent evening, wouldn't you say? The announcement was received perfectly. The Harris family will be pleased.""

Mother nodded. ""The fall wedding will be magnificent. September light is the most flattering for photographs.""

They discussed my life as if I weren't there, as if I were a project to be managed rather than a person with a beating heart.

I stared at the back of Caleb's head, at the way his dark hair curled slightly at the nape of his neck.

Once, his eyes caught mine in the rearview mirror, and something electric passed between us—a current of mutual recognition, of understanding.

The connection broke when he looked away, and I felt its loss like a physical pain.

The estate loomed before us, a monument to wealth disguised as a home.

In the grand foyer, Father summoned the staff with a snap of his fingers.

""Show Mr. O'Brien to the blue guest suite. Give him whatever he requires.""

Caleb thanked them with a warmth my father never showed the staff. Before following them upstairs, he turned to me, his gaze lingering for a fraction too long.

Something unspoken passed between us—a silent acknowledgment of the storm brewing beneath the surface of this perfect tableau.

I watched him ascend the staircase, my eyes tracing his movements until he disappeared from view. Taking with him some vital element I hadn't known I needed until it was gone.

""Goodnight,"" Father said curtly, already turning away, Mother a shadow at his heels.

The dismissal ignited something in me—a spark of defiance I'd suppressed for twenty-two years.

""I need to talk about this engagement,"" I said, my voice low but sharp enough to cut glass.

They froze, twin statues of privilege and power.

Mother turned slowly, fear flickering across her face like a candle in the wind. Father's expression darkened, thunderclouds gathering on the horizon of his features.

""We're not having this conversation in the hallway,"" he snapped. ""Both of you—my study. Half an hour.""

Thirty minutes later, I sat rigid in one of the leather chairs facing my father's imposing mahogany desk.

Mother perched beside me, her posture perfect even in her discomfort.

Father paced behind his desk, each step a threat.

""Your attitude is not just disappointing, Mikaela, it's ungrateful,"" he began, his voice a scalpel cutting through any illusion I had of being heard. ""And Camille, your failure to properly instill respect in our daughter is evident tonight.""

Mother flinched as if struck, but remained silent.

""Do you have any idea how fortunate you are?"" he continued, stopping pacing.

He was now pointing at me with a finger that had crushed business rivals without remorse.

""The Harris family is our equal—strong, traditional, powerful. They want their son to marry a woman who embodies their values. A pure, virgin woman from a respectable family, raised with discipline and honor. You fit that mold perfectly.""

The word ‘virgin’ in my father's mouth made me want to claw my skin off.

That my purity was a selling point in this transaction twisted something deep inside me.

""This arrangement isn't just a marriage, it's a statement. A model for what family should still mean in this broken world.""

His words settled in the room like lead, heavy and poisonous.

""And let me be absolutely clear: if you fail to fulfill your part of this agreement in four months, if you try to run, refuse or rebel, you will be cut off completely. No trust fund. No credit cards. No apartment. No name. Nothing. You'll learn what life looks like without the Wallace name to protect you. Because beyond this role, Mikaela, you have nothing. There is no other future waiting for you out there.""

Each syllable drove deeper into my chest, puncturing the fragile bubble of hope I'd been nurturing.

But beneath the fear, something else stirred—a fury so pure it burned away the edges of my learned helplessness.

""I've been the perfect daughter,"" I said, my voice trembling not with fear but with rage. ""I've followed every rule, kept every appearance. And still, I'm not allowed to choose my own life?""

Father's laugh was devoid of warmth, a sound made of ice and contempt.

""Your mother and I had an arrangement too, and we built a life others envy. You're lucky to follow in our footsteps!""

A bitter truth crystallized in my mind as I turned to Mother.

Really seeing her for the first time—the careful makeup that couldn't quite hide the emptiness in her eyes, the practiced smile that never reached beyond her lips.

""And are you happy, Mom?"" The question emerged, razor-sharp and unavoidable. ""Because from where I stand, you don't look happy. You look trapped.""

Mother's eyes widened, the careful mask slipping to reveal raw terror beneath—not at my words, but at the truth they exposed.

The truth she'd spent decades burying beneath designer clothes and society smiles.

Before Father could respond, she rose from her chair in one fluid motion and struck me across the face with an open palm.

The crack echoed through the room like a gunshot.

My head flew to the side, my hand flying to my burning cheek when the metallic taste of blood bloomed where my teeth had cut the inside of my mouth.

But it wasn't the physical pain that stunned me into silence—it was the betrayal in that single, violent act.

Twenty-two years of complicity, of silent acceptance, concentrated into one searing moment of truth.

In my mother's eyes, I saw not anger, but terror.

The terror of a woman who recognized her own reflection in a daughter who dared to speak what she had never been brave enough to acknowledge.

""There's no place for physical violence in this house,"" my father said, his voice cold with displeasure.

The irony was so bitter I could taste it along with the blood inside my mouth.

""Yeah, only emotional apparently,"" I muttered, the words slipping out before I could swallow them.

Father's jaw tightened, but he directed his attention to my mother instead.

""Take care of her. Make sure her face stays perfect.""

The study door clicked shut. Mother straightened her blouse, eyes scanning my face with clinical detachment.

""Get ice for that mark."" No apology, no tears—just damage control for damaged merchandise.

I nodded, another perfect, obedient response from the perfect, obedient daughter.

As we separated in the hallway, the truth crystallized like ice in my veins: she wasn't trapped in this gilded cage with me, she was one of the zookeepers.

Her manicured hands held the same keys as father's, just wore prettier gloves while turning them.

What I needed was something cold—for my face, for my heart, for the realization that I was completely alone. I made my way downstairs, careful to avoid the creaking floorboards that might alert the house to my wandering.

The kitchen light was already on when I rounded the corner, and I stopped short, my breath catching in my throat.

Caleb sat at the island counter, scrolling through his phone with casual ease.

He'd changed from his formal attire into sweatpants and a fitted t-shirt that clung to the contours of his wide muscular chest and shoulders in a way that made my mouth go dry.

The domesticity of the scene, this powerful man in simple house slippers, relaxed in our kitchen, created an intimacy I wasn't prepared for.

My body reacted before my mind could intervene, a flush creeping up my neck that had nothing to do with my injury.

He looked up immediately, his expression shifting from surprise to concern in an instant.

""What happened to your face?"" he asked, already moving toward me.

Before I could respond, he was in the freezer, pulling out a pack of frozen berries.

His movements were efficient, purposeful. One hand guided me to the stool he'd just vacated, the other gently pressed the makeshift ice pack against my burning cheek.

The cold relief was immediate, but it was nothing compared to the jolt that ran through me at his touch—careful, tender, concerned.

Our eyes met, and something unspoken passed between us.

I wondered if he could feel my pulse racing beneath his fingertips, if he knew that my breath had shortened not from pain but from his proximity.

""Do you want to talk about it?"" he asked, his voice low and steady.

I looked away, unable to bear the intensity of his gaze. ""No.""

My mind swirled with confused emotions. I tried to recall a single instance when my father had shown me the kind of immediate care that Caleb just had.

The blank space where those memories should have been yawned inside me like an abyss. But what disturbed me most wasn't the absence of fatherly care in my life.

It was that I didn't want Caleb to be fatherly at all.

The feeling coursing through me wasn't daughterly gratitude, but something far more dangerous—curiosity. Attraction.

A visceral pull toward him as a man who saw me, who responded to my pain with gentleness instead of calculation.

I fought to banish the thought, ashamed of its persistence.

""It'll be gone by morning,"" Caleb said softly. ""The mark.""

I looked back at him and smiled, a real smile, unguarded and genuine.

Something shifted in his expression, a flicker of emotion quickly masked.

He swallowed visibly, and I felt a surprising surge of power at having affected him.

Desperate to break the tension crackling between us, I asked, ""So... what kind of business do you have with my father?""

Caleb hesitated, his expression tightening momentarily before relaxing into something more vulnerable.

""Your father and I... we were close, once. Good friends, not just business partners. But something happened years ago put a strain on that. We haven't really spoken since.""

I watched him closely, sensing the weight behind his words. The careful editing of a story too complex for casual sharing.

""I'm here now,"" he continued, ""partly for business... but also because I want to fix what I broke. I'm hoping there's still a friendship worth saving.""

His honesty disarmed me.

I wanted to ask if he was a good man, if I could trust the strange feelings he stirred in me.

Instead, I just asked, ""Is that why you're not sleeping?""

He nodded, his lips curving slightly.

""That, and some messages I didn't have time to reply to during your birthday dinner.""

I laughed softly, the sound strange to my own ears after so much tension.

""Sorry for the disruption.""

His smile widened. ""It's alright.""

The cold pack had warmed against my skin, but neither of us had moved to adjust it. His hand remained gentle against my face, the point of contact between us charged with something I didn't dare name.

""This should be enough,"" he finally said, pulling away and returning the pack to the freezer.

When he turned back to me, his expression had softened into something that made my chest ache.

""Happy birthday, Mikaela.""

The simple wish, delivered with such genuine warmth, struck me more deeply than any formal toast or expensive gift.

I didn't know what to say, so I said nothing, letting the silence between us speak the words I couldn't form.

After he left, I lingered in the kitchen, my cheek still tingling—from the cold or from his touch, I couldn't tell. My body felt like a stranger's, alive with sensations I'd never allowed myself to acknowledge.

Sleep came in restless fragments that night.

My dreams are a confusing blur of people and feelings—my father's cold ultimatum, Caleb's gentle hands...

Then the nightmare fractures, and suddenly it's just Caleb.

His fingers no longer pressing frozen berries to my cheek but tracing fire down my neck instead.

Dream-logic shifts the kitchen to a bedroom I've never seen but somehow recognize as his. The night air feels electric against my bare shoulders.

""You deserve better,"" dream-Caleb whispers, his mouth dangerously close to my ear, sending ripples of heat spiraling down my spine.

His reverent hands are everywhere, the antithesis of everything I've been taught about men and their desires.

I arch against him, greedy and unrestrained in a way waking-me could never be. Here, in this nocturnal fantasy, I'm not anybody's precious commodity or careful investment.

I'm just wanted. The distinction breaks something open inside me.

When I wake, sheets twisted around my legs, my skin feels simultaneously too tight and too sensitive. The ghost of his touch lingers like a question I'm finally brave enough to ask.

There, on my nightstand, sat an exquisite bouquet of flowers. Fresh. Vibrant. Beautiful.

I blinked, startled into full wakefulness. My heart quickened as I sat up and reached for them.

Does my cat hate my boyfriend?,"Ever since I started dating my boyfriend (~7 months ago), my cat has been getting more and more aggressive around human food. 

We usually eat in the living room on the couch /coffee table, so he can easy get up on the couch and try to stick his little hands into our food. Usually, I gently push him away each time. Lately, though, he gets very aggressive when I do this. He tries to bite hands, and he will swat at whoever is gently moving him (both myself and my boyfriend). It is not the same as his playful fake swats, and he has NEVER tried to bite me like this before (save the few times a year I have to trim his butt fur)

My cat has no other behavioral problems. He does not like to be picked up by anyone but me, so on the off chance someone does that, he will hiss or try to claw. He will also hiss or try to claw at boyfriend if boyfriend is annoying him (petting him when he’s on the couch and not in the mood).

1mnftzp,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_Helpful_ruben/comments/1mnftzp/strategic_partnership_hacks/,Strategic Partnership Hacks,"After years of building and operating startups, I've learned a thing or two about striking gold with strategic partnerships. In this post, I'll share my top hacks for navigating these crucial relationships, gleaned from my own experiences and those of my peers.

First and foremost, define your goals for the partnership upfront. Are you looking to grow your user base, tap into new markets, or access new technologies? Be crystal clear on what you want to achieve, as this will inform the type of partners you target.

Next, don't be afraid to pick up the phone and make calls. Personal connections and relationships can be just as important as formal agreements. Build trust and rapport with potential partners through regular communication, and never underestimate the power of a good old-fashioned coffee or lunch meeting.

When vetting partners, prioritize companies with complementary strengths and a shared vision. Look for firms that share your values and are willing to roll up their sleeves to achieve the desired outcome. A partnership that's truly aligned will be able to weather any storms that come its way.

Negotiate with conviction, but also be flexible and open to compromise. Remember that the goal is to achieve a mutually beneficial agreement – don't try to ""win"" at all costs. And never, ever sign anything without having a lawyer review it!

Finally, don't underestimate the importance of communication and regular check-ins. Keep the lines of communication open to address any issues or concerns that arise, and use data and metrics to track the partnership's progress and make adjustments as needed.

By following these strategic partnership hacks, I've found that even the most unlikely of alliances can yield remarkable results. Happy partnering!",1,1754925558.0,u_Helpful_ruben,0,1.0,False

1mnftx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/LetsTalkMusic/comments/1mnftx7/stomp_clap_hey_was_never_a_hipster_genre_hipsters/,"Stomp Clap Hey was NEVER a ""hipster"" genre. Hipsters despised it because it was always extremely uncool.","""Stomp clap hey"" was the genre of very generic early 2010s millennial ""indie""-folk played by facelessly interchangeable millennials using ukeleles, banjos or glockenspiels with wooooooaoooaoaoooah layered anthemic choruses that became a mainstream sensation and soon soundtracked every car and insurance commercial and corporate coffee shop was the bane of my existence at the time and the point where I finally found a genre more cloying than Christmas music.

At the time and even now, I see stomp clap hey labelled a ""hipster genre"" but that strikes me as very odd. Pitchfork and other indie hipsters tastemakers utterly detested that stuff. Hipsters were listening to Deerhunter and Kurt Vile and Washed Out at the time, not Lumineers and Mumford and Sons.

Kids who grew up in that era obviously were drawn to the simplicity and repetitiveness and thus those songs that were forcefed to them became normal and nostalgic for them, but hipsters were certainly NOT listening to that stuff.

I say that, but I know for a fact that was the time when ""hipster"" was probably misunderstood to mean that you had a peculiar beard from the 1800s, a man bun, questionable handwashing skills, a useless college degree and thanks to your daddy's trust fund you could afford to live in NYC while you work as a barista at a generic looking coffee house or artisanal burger shop that played Edward Sharpe and the Zeroes all day.

As an older millennial, I remember that ""hipster"" before that meant you liked obscure bands nobody but you had heard of in obscure genres, art films, irony and 60s-80s fashion and music. Sure, a lot of hipsters in the early 2000s liked indie-folk like Neutral Milk Hotel and Sufjan Stevens, but that stuff was obscure and weird and idiosyncratic, not braindead singalongs for the lowest common denominator played at every Taco Bell and Starbucks and on American Idol.

The fact that these stomp clap hey bands stole aspects of their sound and style from actually pretty good bands and then watered them down to the point they were marketably inoffensive to everyone and devoid of the legacy of authentic indie rock made it all the more annoying. I can't even enjoy Arcade Fire's *Funeral* anymore without thinking about some of the horrendous acts and songs that the corporate labels tried to mercilessly drill into our brains that followed a few years later in its wake. But that's kind of like saying you can't enjoy Nirvana anymore because of Nickelback's ubiquitous warmed over butt rock rehash.

Stomp clap hey was basically the follow up to Coldplay in more ways than one. Coldplay went from originally marginally liked by hipsters for their loose early resemblance to Radiohead's ballads, to despised for stealing and dumbing down Radiohead for the masses while not contributing any new innovations and writing basic singalong white bread sentimental pop-rock that felt inauthentically ""sentimental"". Stomp clap hey may have started out as something that had sonic references to bands hipsters liked, but was wholly uncool and overtly and simplistically sentimental in a Hallmark movie kind of way.

And honestly, this comparison is kind of unfair to Coldplay because, as contrived as they were, they are still a talented band and their music was annoying but at least somewhat palatable, like a mixture of Radiohead, Peter Gabriel, Sting and U2 that had been focus group tested and polished for maximum mainstream white people popularity. Stomp clap hey was basically just well produced sappy campfire singalongs focus group tested and polished for mainstream white people popularity. Just hammer the ""whoa oh oh oh oh oh oh"" into our heads a few hundred times and you have a giant hit, apparently, because humans are suckers and corporations saw dollar signs in their eyes from this reductionism.

Stomp clap hey sounded like the secular music that American evangelicals and Mormons would have listened to when they were around people who didn't want to listen to Christian rock. The big choruses, feigned authenticity and folksy instrumentation must remind them of participatory Sunday megachurch singalongs.

You can criticize hipsters for a lot of things (pretentiousness, inauthenticity, snobbery, etc.), but claiming they listened to stomp clap hey (unironically at least) is just flat insulting and disregarding the very essence of what made people hipsters in the first place.",89,1754925554.0,LetsTalkMusic,61,0.87,False

She had a big smile on her flushed, pretty face as she pranced over to the coffee pot. Diane and I waiting to hear from her.

Kim sat down, still grinning as she lit a smoke. Her robe was synched loosely revealing her cleavage. She blew out the drag, sipped her coffee, and let out breathy gasp.

“Whew! He wanted to know auntie better, and he’s getting to. He has such a gorgeous body for a young man. Much like his brother. I’m glad he’s taken to me, taken to all of us. As awful as that may sound.” Kim commented.

Diane then responded, “I felt that way at first, when it happened with Kenny. But as Dotty has said many times, we’re all adults and no is being forced to do anything. It kind of felt that way earlier, though, when I pulled Danny into my room and stripped him.”

Kim and I laughed and Kim said that he enjoyed it or he would have skedaddled. That he definitely enjoyed her visit.

“He definitely is a tit guy, huh. I may have a hickey or two. I know he left finger marks.” Kim added.

Diane then added to this tittie topic and young Danny, “I know, right. He nibbled and sucked my nipples so hard that I thought he’d suck them right off of my boobs. But I love my nipples pinched hard. Harder the better. Drives me crazy.”

I just smiled listening to this tittie banter. Three women in our 40’s discussing the tittie fetish of a horny 18 year old. It was a funny topic for a coffee clutch.

There we sat in our robes. Three women who were mothers, Kim, 49, even being a grandmother with her daughter being married with a child. Diane, 46, has a daughter also, and I, 45, have twin sons, all of whom are older than the two young men that we’re banging. 

Speaking of banging, all of this sex and tittie talk, had me thinking about young Danny in Diane’s bed yet. “Excuse me, you two. Think I’ll go see how my new neighbor if doing.” I said with a smirk.

I got up and went to Diane’s bedroom doorway. There laid young Danny on his tummy, arms folded under the pillow. The sight of his smooth, sleek body gave me a horny shiver.

He was still, eyes closed. I thought he may be asleep. I crept up the bed as I let me robe fall to the floor. His tight ass cheeks are very arousing to me. I wanted to squeeze them, kiss each one, rub my tits all over his back.

I softly said, “Hi Danny. Are you awake. It’s Dotty coming to see how you are.”

Danny lifted his head and turned it far enough to see me standing there naked. “Hi Dotty. I’m not sleeping. Just relaxing you know. It’s been a great morning already. The best I’ve ever had.” 

I slowly knelt up on the bed and straddled his legs. I rubbed my hands over his tight buns to his tanned, slender back.

“You don’t mind me coming to you like this, do you, hon. I know you’ve been busy this morning, with Diane then Auntie Kim. I’d love to get busy with you also if you’d like.” I softly said as my hands roamed over his tight flesh.

Danny made an attempt to roll over and told him to just relax. I came forward and swished my D cup titties all over his back. I let my spread legs straighten out and ground my pubic mound on his ass cheeks.

I slid a hand under his hip and tummy, gripping his semi hard fat cock. “You like that, baby. You like my big titties on your back. Mmm. Your lovely cock is getting so big and hard. I’m pleased that you’ve moved in with Kenny. I think we’re going be good friends, don’t you.” I purred, squeezing his cock to full hardness.

Danny replied with an affirmative and I raised up letting him roll to his back. I rubbed his smooth, muscular chest, smiling at him as I took his hard shaft in my hands as I sat on his legs.

“You make my heart feel like it’ll jump right out of my chest. That’s how turned on you make me. Hope I do the same for you. I said, as I lowered my lips to the bulbous head of his thick cock.

“You do turn me on very much, Dotty. Oh man! Mmm! I’m glad I moved in with Kenny also. Oh God!” Danny sighed from my lips working on his cock.

I could stand it any longer and straddled his hips. Danny gripped my large titties as I placed his cock to my throbbing pussy. I pumped a few times, easing my tight wetness down on his length.

I put my hands on his chest and began fucking him. “You like that, honey. Is this what you wanted. Your big cock feels so fucking good. Mmm!” I panted.

Danny wanted fuck me in other positions. Him having gotten his rocks off twice already this morning, gave him the ability to fuck me longer he probably would if I had been with him first.

He had me lye on my side and he laid behind me. I raised my top leg and Danny gripped and held it up, spreading me open. His cock slid up in me immediately and he pounded against my bare ass. His other arm was under my neck, reaching around to grip my titties as he fucked me wildly.

He had me grunting and moaning terribly. Kim and Diane had to hear this out in the kitchen. I couldn’t help it. Danny was fucking me hard and quick.

Then we fucked doggy style, finishing up with him on top of me. I wasn’t expecting such a thorough fucking from the young kid, but it was awesome I must say.

# Best Single Serve Pour Over Coffee: 2025 Guide

The single-serve pour over coffee market has exploded in recent years, catering to coffee lovers who crave quality and convenience without the commitment of larger brewing systems. These individual coffee brewers offer a simple, mess-free way to enjoy a fresh, flavorful cup, making them ideal for home, office, or travel. This guide explores the top single-serve pour over options for 2025, based on factors like ease of use, coffee quality, portability, and environmental impact. We aim to help you discover the perfect brewing solution to elevate your daily coffee ritual.

## Key Features Analysis

The best single-serve pour over coffee setups offer a balance of simplicity, quality, and convenience. When choosing a system, understanding its core features is essential.

**Brewing Capacity**

Most single-serve pour over devices are designed to brew a single cup of coffee, typically ranging from 8 to 12 ounces. The capacity can slightly vary depending on the specific model and filter type used. Some models come with markings to indicate the ideal water level for specific cup sizes.

**Filter Type and Material**

The choice of filter significantly impacts the flavor profile and environmental sustainability. Common filter types include paper, stainless steel, and cloth.Paper filters are disposable and produce a clean, radiant cup. Stainless steel filters are reusable, allowing more oils and sediment to pass through for a fuller-bodied brew. Cloth filters offer a similar result to stainless steel but require more meticulous cleaning.**Material and Construction**

The materials used in construction impact heat retention, durability, and aesthetic appeal. Common materials include glass, ceramic, stainless steel, and BPA-free plastic. Glass and ceramic offer excellent heat retention but are more fragile. Stainless steel provides durability and resistance to corrosion. BPA-free plastic is a lightweight and affordable option.

**Portability and Compactness**

For users who value portability,the size and design of the pour over device are crucial. Some models are designed to collapse or fold for easy storage and transport.Compact designs minimize space consumption in kitchens or travel bags. Look for features like integrated stands or carrying cases to further enhance portability.

**Ease of cleaning**

Cleaning convenience is an critically important factor for daily use. Models with removable parts are generally easier to clean. Dishwasher-safe components simplify the cleaning process. Some filters require special cleaning tools or solutions to maintain optimal performance.

**Brewing Time**

The typical brewing time for a single serve pour over ranges from 2 to 4 minutes. This depends on factors like the grind size, water temperature, and the flow rate of the water. Some models incorporate features to control the flow rate, allowing for precise adjustment of the brewing time.

## Core Benefits

Single-serve pour over coffee offers a compelling combination of benefits for coffee enthusiasts seeking quality and convenience.

**Remarkable Flavor Control:** Unlike automatic coffee makers, single-serve pour over allows for precise control over every stage of the brewing process, from water temperature and flow rate to bloom time and extraction. This level of control enables users to fine-tune their brewing technique to extract the optimal flavor and aroma from their favorite coffee beans.

**Enhanced Convenience and Speed:** Single-serve pour over offers a quick and easy way to brew a single cup of coffee,eliminating the need to brew a full pot and reducing the risk of waste. The simplicity of the process makes it ideal for busy mornings or on-the-go coffee enjoyment.**Space-Saving Design:** Compact and portable, single-serve pour over devices require minimal counter space and can be easily stored away when not in use. This makes them perfect for small kitchens, dorm rooms, or travel situations where space is limited.

**Reduced Waste and Environmental Impact:** By brewing only the amount of coffee needed, single-serve pour over reduces waste compared to customary brewing methods. The use of reusable filters further minimizes environmental impact by eliminating the need for disposable paper filters. Even if opting for paper filters, many are compostable.

**Cost-Effectiveness:** While the initial investment in a single-serve pour over device might potentially be higher than that of a basic drip coffee maker, the long-term cost-effectiveness can be critically important. By reducing coffee waste and eliminating the need for expensive single-serve coffee pods,users can save money over time.

## FAQs Section

Frequently asked questions about single serve pour over coffee help clarify common concerns and provide valuable information for potential buyers.

**What type of coffee grind is best for single-serve pour over?**
A medium-fine grind is generally recommended for single-serve pour over. This allows for optimal extraction without over-extraction, which can lead to bitter flavors. Experimenting with different grind sizes can help you find the perfect balance for your preferred coffee beans.

**How do I clean my single-serve pour over device?**
The cleaning process depends on the type of material used. For glass or ceramic devices, warm soapy water and a non-abrasive sponge are usually sufficient. Stainless steel filters can be cleaned with dish soap and a soft brush.Paper filters are typically disposable. Make sure to dry all components thoroughly before reassembling.

**Can I use pre-ground coffee with a single-serve pour over?**
While freshly ground coffee is ideal, pre-ground coffee can be used with a single-serve pour over device. However,pre-ground coffee tends to lose its flavor and aroma more quickly than freshly ground beans. For best results, use pre-ground coffee within a few days of grinding.

**How hot should the water be for pour over coffee?**
The ideal water temperature for pour over coffee is between 195°F and 205°F (90°C and 96°C). Using a thermometer or an electric kettle with temperature control ensures optimal brewing. Using water that is too hot can result in burnt or bitter flavors, while using water that is too cold can result in under-extraction and weak coffee.

I’ve lost my “winter insulation.” Who knew I’d be cold in August? Cardigans have become a year-round thing.

My grocery bill is higher. Not because I eat more, but because I’m buying berries, fresh vegetables, yogurt and I eat it all first.

I now own three times as many mirrors as I used to. I kept “accidentally” buying them.

I’ve turned into a total data nerd. I track every meal, exercise, water and pooping - the works. I even take progress pics with every weigh-in (and no, I’m not posting them, even if it would rake in the upvotes). My meagain app and widget has been my secret sauce (no pun intended), somehow motivating instead of obsessive. Only regret is not using an app from the beginning.

I get way more random conversations in public. Strangers suddenly want to ""chat"". Pre-weight loss, this never happened.

Shopping takes forever. Not because I’m hunting for my size, but because I keep grabbing clothes thinking “there’s no way this fits"" and it does.

I have so much energy now that my partner is begging me to sit still while I’m bouncing from one random home project to another.

My caffeine tolerance tanked. One cup of coffee now has me buzzing around like a hummingbird on an espresso drip.

My water bill went up because bubble baths take forever to fill when you’ve got room to actually stretch out in the tub.  
  
  
I’m beyond grateful for how far I’ve come. Tirzepatide/GLP1 has given me parts of my life back I didn’t even realize were missing. The weight loss feels amazing and logging/tracking/reporting everything in my meagain account has made the the lifestyle changes feel like the biggest win.

1mnfl2i,https://www.reddit.com/r/TimHortons/comments/1mnfl2i/feeling_like_i_havent_learnt_anything/,Feeling like I haven't learnt anything,"By september, I'll [19F] have worked at Tim Hortons for 2 years. Despite that, I do not really know/have experience taking orders on drive thru, working soup & sandwich, making various backups or simply being able to handle people properly. I can only do storefront and make eggs comfortably 😭

I got very lucky with my job. I used to be in a club organized by an older lady who knew the owners of the Tim Hortons in my town and she got me a referral. 

For MONTHS I was barely trained and worked maybe 3 hours a week on frid. I only made coffees on drive thru and had to ask multiple times to have more shifts but I had school and wasn't sure if I would handle working weekdays. 

I got good at coffees in terms of speed but then started working sat 5 hrs and sun 3 hrs. I was constantly kept on storefront and for like the next 1.5 years just stayed there. A year ago they cut my sunday shift and now I work sat 4-5 hrs around brunch. I quite literally make $150 biweekly 💀 I hate talking abt it

It was 100% my fault for not bugging them to train me in other areas but my shifts were during rush hours and learning something on sundays wasn't even possible because my horrible shift manager and rude supervisor who both didn't like me for whatever reason. My manager doesn't fw me either because ngl I did make a lot of mistakes for a while even though I tried my best to be helpful and communicate. But I have excuses cz they would change rules/policies and I would never find out until I did something wrong and got yelled at for it 😭 I hated this job and would cry in the bathroom a lot and it gave me anxiety issues for more than 1.5 years. 

It's chill now but I regret not taking initiative very early on. My parents would get upset and tell me to talk to my manager and trust me to this day I ask for more hours but get clowned on when they give some random trainee more hours than me. 

For the first time in 2 years, I have been asked to cover a shift. Its today Monday 3-7pm, and I am terrified they'll be mad I cant do sandwiches or take orders drive thru 😭🙏 am i cooked chat

TLDR: Working like max 5-8 hours per week for 2 years, learned jack shit abt how to do the job properly cz I'm dumb and now I feel stupid and regret not taking initiative early on and assuming everything will be okay with time.",1,1754925011.0,TimHortons,1,1.0,False

I fell a lot, but came out with just a few cuts and bruises.

I run a few times a week, usually hitting 15-20 total miles - and then I also bike a few times a week (maybe 30-40 miles). I am not a super strong runner but decently fit, having recently done a road 5K in \~21 min and a 10K in \~45 min (this one had some elevation, \~400 ft ascent, \~400 ft descent).

While I felt tired on the second half of the trail race, I was feeling pretty normal - heart rate did average 171 which feels high in hindsight. It was very hot and humid - and I felt like absolute trash a few hours after the race. I struggled to sleep, had some bad muscle spasms in my leg (which I haven't gotten after longer runs in the heat?), and had some serious nausea. I am thinking maybe I had heat exhaustion? 

Here are some things I did before / after the race that I think were not smart:

\- Prior to the race I had drank a lot of coffee that day - including a double espresso. 

\- Had a large beer after the race (also had a gatorade, but barely any water)

  
I did hydrate a normal amount in the days leading up to the run, but honestly it was a bit scary how horrendous I felt a few hours after the race. Any tips? I'd like to do this type of event again, but want to be better prepared. It seems pretty clear to me in hindsight that my use of diuretics is likely not helpful.

I matched with several people and am texting. Had a few coffee meets, some ghosting etc. Matched with a guy that I like recently. He seems emotionally mature and like a good communicator so far. I find myself being hopeful and daydreaming about something real with us. But I also realize that this is lonliness talking, I don’t know him at all yet and I shouldn’t get ahead of myself. 

I decided to prompt ChatGPT to give me reminders to not move too fast. To sit with the lonliness a bit instead of putting too many expectations on this connection.

The River Flows
Loneliness is just a passing ripple on the river of your life—it’s not the whole current. You’ve already walked through a storm and found your footing again. You don’t need to chase love; when the time is right, it will meet you like two rivers joining. For now, let your own life flow with things that bring you peace, joy, and purpose, and let love arrive naturally.

Sitting with the Feeling
It’s okay to sit with your loneliness without trying to push it away or fix it right away. Feel it, breathe into it, and notice that it rises and falls like a wave. You are not the feeling—you are the ocean that holds it. As you keep showing up for yourself with kindness and patience, the right connections will find you, drawn to the warmth you already carry.

The Garden Within
Loneliness is the winter of the heart—it can feel bare, but beneath the soil, roots are growing. Every time you nourish yourself—with friends, passions, rest, or laughter—you are tending the inner garden. One day, someone will step into it and see it in full bloom. Until then, remember that your worth isn’t waiting to be proven by another’s gaze—you already are whole, and already enough.",0,1754924778.0,datingoverforty,26,0.23,False

The SisBroo B/W-4 Cord Organizer's design hooked me from the very first use. As someone whose kitchen counter often resembles a giant spaghetti tangle of appliance cords, I desperately needed something to fix the mess. This compact silicon cable organizer does the trick. At just 4.05 x 1.06 x 0.04 inches, it's surprisingly efficient, taking up almost no noticeable space on your appliances while keeping things impressively tidy. My blender and coffee maker cords, which I used to trip over like some kitchen obstacle course, now sit neatly wrapped and secure. Plus, its bow shape adds a charming touch—I mean, who thought cord management could actually be sort of cute?

The **[Check SisBroo B/W-4 price on Amazon](https://applianceheaven.com/link/b0b9jcsxnx/)** link made it ridiculously easy to hop onto Amazon and snag a pack for my kitchen overhaul.

**Durable Silicone Material**

This cord organizer isn't just functional—it's built for longevity. Made from high-quality silicone, it offers not just durability but also flexibility. My appliances don't all have flat backs, some have curved edges that would usually make adhesion a nightmare. SisBroo's silicone material handles this seamlessly. The ductility ensures the organizer hugs even curved surfaces, while its resistance to high temperatures is crucial in a space where my microwave and toaster are everyday warriors. I've touched the silicone while adjusting cords post-use on my air fryer—it doesn’t heat up or degrade over time. Bonus points for its soft, almost velvety touch. It’s one of those small things that make it oddly satisfying every time.

**Strong Adhesive That Stays Put**

No one wants a cord organizer that decides to give up by peeling off within weeks. This was a big concern for me because I had tried stick-on organizers before, and ""sticky"" was only in their description, not their performance. SisBroo’s use of high-quality PE foam adhesive is a game-changer. Of course, I followed the instructions by cleaning and drying the surface before sticking it on. I was initially skeptical, especially about the friction-heavy placement on my coffee maker, which gets used (and wiped down) twice daily. But here we are a month later, and it's still firmly in place. No sliding, no peeling. I even gave it a slight tug to test its grip—nothing budged.

**Wide-Ranging Applications**

Versatility isn’t just a buzzword when it comes to these cord organizers. They fit perfectly on everything from my pressure cooker to the toaster, air fryer, and blender. It doesn’t stop in the kitchen either—I added one to my work desk for my computer and phone cords, which used to just hang out in some chaotic digital tangle. Even keychains and my bag strap found a home with this little gadget. If you’re someone who loves multi-functional tools as much as I do, these organizers might just spark joy for you.

**Perks**

- Adhesive strength ensures no detachment, even with frequent appliance movement.
- Made from heat-resistant silicone that’s safe for environments like kitchens.
- Compact design brings tidiness without looking clunky or obtrusive.
- Works across flat and curved surfaces alike.
- Multi-use across appliances, office desks, and even for household hooks.

**Areas for Improvement**

- The adhesive works wonderfully on smooth, clean surfaces, but textured appliances may face compatibility issues.
- They’re excellent as a concept, but an extra color option apart from black and white would have been welcome. Maybe a gray or neutral tone to blend in better across different appliances.
- Removing an organizer once attached seems tricky without leaving residue, so double-check positioning before sticking.

**Market Rivals**

Compared to other cord organizing options like silicone straps or larger plastic mounts, this product leads in convenience. For example, zip ties—while cheap—become a mess to deal with if cords need adjusting later. On the other hand, bulkier mounts tend to look cumbersome, which isn't ideal if aesthetics matter in your workspace or kitchen. I tried a competing product that boasted a similar adhesive concept but lacked SisBroo’s ductility for curved surfaces. It ended up popping off my air fryer within days. SisBroo seems to hit a sweet spot between size, functionality, and versatility.

**Value for Money**

Evaluating this cord organizer’s utility against its cost brings up an interesting point—it punches well above its weight. My initial concern was that a pack of four wouldn’t go far enough for multiple applications, but its versatility won me over. It covers such a wide range of appliances and home uses without any performance drops. While other options might be cheaper in bulk, their limited flexibility and adhesive reliability aren’t worth the penny saved.

All keys are global unless mentioned otherwise (they might still have region blocks for Russia/Belarus/China – ask and I'll double check).

**Looking for games on** [**my wishlist**](https://lestrades.com/@febrik/wishlist/Some)**.**

I've picked up almost all Humble/Fanatical-bundled games I'm interested in from the last years, but a few I'm still looking for are:

*~~Indika~~* */ 9th Dawn Remake / Transistor / Super Blood Hockey / Lunacid / Warplanes: WW1 Fighters / Vampyr /* *Yaga* */* *~~Banishers: Ghost of New Eden (NA key)~~* */* *~~#Drive Rally~~* */ Dark Pictures Anthology: Devil in Me /* *~~Sands of~~* ~~Salazar~~ */ Achilles: Legends Untold / HeistGeist / Star Shelter / Arcanum: Of Steamworks and Magick Obscura / The Almost Gone*

I'm not very excited to trade my never bundled keys for keys from bundles (unless it's a great offer).

Only trading for Steam games or Steam gift cards (not interested in GOG/EA/PayPal/tf2/crypto).

1mnfdyd,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegas/comments/1mnfdyd/specific_request_casino_hotel_in_walking_distance/,"SPECIFIC REQUEST: casino hotel in walking distance of a karaoke box, vegan restaurant, and coffee shop  ?","I've been to Vegas eight times since 2012, and I've always stayed on the Strip. Due to exorbitant prices these days, I'd like to try somewhere more reasonable off Strip.  I'm fine if the area is close to the Strip, downtown, or even in the suburbs.   

As the post title says, I'd like to stay at a **hotel with a casino** that's in walking distance of a **karaoke box** (Japanese or Korean preferred), a **vegan restaurant** (or restaurants with some good vegan options), and a **coffee shop** (chain or otherwise).  It would be even better if there was a grocery store and/or other shopping options nearby.  

I've tried searching this on Google Maps, but it's difficult since not all establishments are listed.    
  
Thanks in advance.   ",0,1754924550.0,vegas,3,0.21,False

1mnfan5,https://www.reddit.com/r/CoffeeBrewerReviews/comments/1mnfan5/find_out_if_the_cuisinart_ss10_single_serve/,Find Out If the Cuisinart SS-10 Single Serve Coffee Maker Delivers Quality Review,"The Cuisinart SS-10, also known as the Premium Single-Serve Brewer, has been hands-on tested over the past month in my household. Part of Cuisinart’s versatile lineup, it promises to be both functional and stylish. With features like a 72-ounce water reservoir, multi-cup size options, compatibility with K-Cup pods, and a reusable filter cup, it certainly sets itself apart from your average coffee machine. Though the experience was mostly positive, there are a few things to weigh in on before committing.

**Sleek Design and Build Quality**

This coffee maker's polished stainless steel finish certainly adds a touch of class to the kitchen. It’s compact but spacious enough, with dimensions of 11.03""D x 9.33""W x 12.13""H, making it easy to fit on most countertops without feeling intrusive. The blue backlit LCD sits prominently on the front, creating an intuitive control interface, which is incredibly straightforward even when groggy first thing in the morning.

**Convenient Features**

What I appreciated most about this brewing device was its versatility in coffee preparation. By offering five different coffee sizes (ranging from 4 oz to 12 oz) and temperature adjustability, it adapts comfortably to varying preferences. The hot water button is great – my kids enjoyed making quick bowls of instant soup, and I frequently used it to prep some herbal teas. Plus, the rinse feature is fantastic to keep the machine clean with just one button press.

**Ease of Use & Day-to-Day Performance**

Using the Cuisinart SS-10 daily became second nature. Loading different K-Cup brands or even my own ground coffee through the HomeBarista reusable filter cup was a breeze. The drip tray, which can be adjusted or removed to fit my larger thermos, added a level of practicality I didn’t realize I needed. The fully automatic operation is a gift for those of us who stumble towards coffee machines in a pre-caffeinated haze.

Though the machine brews a mean cup of coffee within minutes, it’s not as quiet as I’d hoped during operation. This took me by surprise initially, but over time it became less noticeable, especially since the brew speed compensates for the noise.

**Strengths**

- Large 72-ounce water reservoir reduces frequent filling.  
- Compatible with K-Cup pods and reusable filter cup for ground coffee.  
- Hot water button for soups, teas, and hot cocoa.  
- Adjustable temperature control for a tailored experience.

**Limitations**

- Louder brewing cycle than expected.  
- Plastic components don't feel as durable as the metal body.  

**Comparing to Direct Competitors**

One of the closest competitors to the product is Keurig’s range of single-serve coffee makers, particularly the Keurig K-Elite. While the Keurig offers similar beverage size settings and is quieter during operation, it lacks the reusable filter cup in the box, meaning you may need to factor that into the cost. However, the Cuisinart unit’s hot water button and rinse function give it an edge for multi-purpose use. If noise during brewing is a sticking point for you, the Keurig might feel like a better fit.

The Nespresso Vertuo, on the other hand, competes more on brewing quality and the taste of specialty drinks such as espresso. However, the upfront and recurring cost of Nespresso pods is considerably higher, which could deter budget-conscious shoppers. This brewer, with its K-Cup compatibility, comes out ahead in terms of affordability and utility for households with diverse preferences.

**Bang for the Buck**

While it isn’t the cheapest option, this machine stands out for its price-to-quality ratio. Its programmability and versatility make it excellent value against its peers. If you’re someone who values convenience over specialty brewing methods, it’s worth every penny. Not to mention, the inclusion of a reusable filter already saves money in the long run.

I’m soft-spoken, playful, dry-witted, and easy to be around once I warm up. I’m the kind of woman who’ll remember how you take your coffee, make you laugh when you’re stressed, and cook your favorite meal just because I can. I’ve also been told I have a calming energy.

I work full-time in a field I enjoy, but I’m building toward a different kind of life. I want to work part-time for the perks, not to pay the bills. I’m ultimately looking to be a mostly stay-at-home wife. No kids, but definitely lots of pets. That’s a non-negotiable for me, as I cannot have children. I want to create a peaceful, loving home, cook often, care deeply, and be a genuine source of warmth and support for the man I choose.

That said, my time and energy are valuable and I don’t stretch them thin. I stay busy, so I don’t make room for just anyone. I’m looking for one emotionally intelligent, financially secure man who’s genuinely interested in building a long-term connection leading to marriage. Someone confident, consistent, kind, and clear about what he wants.

Physically, I’ve been drawn to all types. My past partners have ranged from slim to fit to a little soft around the edges. What they had in common was that they took care of themselves. Impeccable hygiene, great style, and glasses with a cute smile behind them go a long way with me. I’m into men who look put together, smell good, and carry themselves with quiet confidence.


A little more about me


My happy places are quiet coffee shops, cozy bookstores, fancy dumpling spots, and live music venues. I love cooking, traveling, and gaming on both PC and Xbox. I have a cat and a long bucket list that includes visiting a Samoyed café in South Korea. I’m the kind of person who’s just as happy dressed up at a rooftop bar as I am curled up on the couch splitting takeout with someone I adore.

1mnf7tn,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1mnf7tn/sf_the_fall_of_marcus_chen/,[SF] The Fall of Marcus Chen,"The roar was a sound I knew instinctively as the end. Not the end of the world, but the end of my world. I was on the Harrison Bridge, where I often went to count rivets—a habit that felt like an act of faith against the universe’s innate chaos. The sound came from upstream: the tearing of the earth, the unstoppable crush of a colossal current. The bridge vibrated under my feet, a dying thing.
I was standing at the edge when the south span buckled. The steel screamed. The concrete groaned. I felt the sudden, sickening drop, the tilt of the world turning on its side. In that instant, every calculation I had ever made became meaningless. The odds of survival from a 47-foot fall into that churning water were nonexistent. I knew I was about to die.

But I didn't.

One moment, I was falling. The next, I was simply there, standing on the riverbank, soaked to the bone, watching. Not watching myself fall, but watching the bridge crumble into the raging current. The roar was still in my ears, but now it was a physical sensation, an echo in my chest. The world saw me as a survivor, a witness to a terrible tragedy. But I was still Marcus Chen, and I was also... not.

The first clue was my clothes. My pants were soaked, my boots caked with mud. But the t-shirt I was wearing—a simple, gray cotton shirt—felt alien. I didn’t own a shirt like that. It was the kind of thing you’d grab in a rush from a discount rack. Yet here it was on my body, the collar stretched just so, the fabric smelling faintly of salt and chlorine. It felt like a disguise I hadn't chosen.
I walked away from the river, the chaos of sirens and frantic voices blurring behind me. No one saw me as a victim. They saw me as a man who had escaped, a lucky one. But luck felt too simple. I was here, but a part of me was still falling, a part of me was still standing on that bridge.

Later, from a coffee shop with the television news muttering in the corner, I learned the details. The dam had given way. Two hundred fifty-three people were confirmed dead or missing. They showed footage of rescue teams pulling bodies from the debris, a somber parade of shattered lives. I watched, a knot forming in my stomach. The implications of my own survival were now a constant, low-grade hum of dread.

I went back to the bridge site the next day, wearing the strange gray shirt that felt more like a costume with every step. I needed to see. I had to know. The rescue effort was still underway, the air thick with the smell of river water and grief.

Fifteen bodies passed. Twenty. Then the last one.
My breath hitched. The pants—they were mine. The faded blue jeans, the specific tear on the right knee from a trip-and-fall I'd had last year. The face was me, too. Almost. The nose was a little straighter, the scar above the eyebrow a little less defined. But the eyes—those were my eyes. Lifeless, staring into a sky they'd never see again.

But the shirt was different. It was a dark, long-sleeved flannel I'd bought for a camping trip two years ago. I remembered buying it. I remembered wearing it. But I wasn’t wearing it now. And the body wasn’t wearing the strange gray shirt I had on.

I stood there, invisible among the mourners and the crews, watching my own body pass by. Was it me? A different me? Or just a cruel, horrible trick of probability? The odds of surviving that fall were razor-thin. So thin that the only logical explanation was that I hadn't survived. The man in the flannel shirt, with my face and my jeans, was Marcus Chen. And the man in the strange gray t-shirt, standing on the riverbank, was an anomaly.

I left, walking away from my own death. The world kept turning. My apartment was still there. My job still existed. My life was waiting for me. But I had changed. The man who had counted rivets, who believed in order and mathematics, was gone.

I was still Marcus Chen, but I was also an echo. A copy of a man who had died, living on borrowed time in a world that saw me as a survivor. I didn't feel like a survivor. I felt like a ghost, haunting the edges of a life that wasn't quite mine anymore.
And every time I passed a mirror, I had to look. Not to see myself, but to see if the face looking back was the man who had fallen, or the man who had simply appeared.

The question lingers, a quiet panic beneath the surface of every day. Was I the survivor, or just the wrong person who got to be a ghost?

Its original name was Oak, inspired by a tree outside James Gosling’s office window.

When they discovered that the name Oak was already trademarked they had to find something new. The team wanted a short and memorable name that felt energetic and global.

They were devoted coffee drinkers and one type of coffee stood out to them. Java coffee, grown on the Indonesian island of Java, became the inspiration. The name captured the energy and warmth they wanted to associate with their language.

That is why the logo features a steaming coffee cup and not an island or palm tree. The connection to the island is indirect, existing only through the coffee that kept the developers going during long nights of coding.",0,1754924118.0,programming,1,0.23,False
1mnf6ee,https://www.reddit.com/r/unpopularopinion/comments/1mnf6ee/youre_drinking_your_coffee_too_hot/,You’re drinking your coffee too hot,"Coffee tastes better when it’s lukewarm. I’m talking about ~110F. It’s true for all types of coffee; espresso, pour over, or drip. I’m aware of people ordering coffee extra hot for some reason, but what are their tongues and palates made of, titanium? If you put liquids into your mouth at 200F or more, you’re going to scald yourself. You have to let the coffee cool down a bit to avoid injury, plus at such a high temperature a lot of the flavor is muted. When the coffee cools significantly, so much more nuanced flavor comes out. At the other end of the spectrum, iced coffee hides much of the flavor because it’s too cold. Additionally, many iced coffee drinks are full of milk and other adulterations that overwhelm the coffee. I did once have a delicious shakerato on a very hot day in Italy, but that was just good espresso and sugar shaken with ice. My advice is if you really want to experience the full flavor of your coffee, brew it at the recommended temperature for proper extraction, but let it rest a bit before you enjoy it. 

PS if you’re reading this outside the US, I apologize for using Freedom Units. I learned SI units in school, and I know they make more sense, but I still have trouble using them in my day to day. 

EDIT: Sorry that the title pissed some people off, but it is just my opinion. I probably could have said “Lukewarm coffee tastes better”, but it’s too late now. Thanks to those who pointed out that you order extra hot because you’re waiting to drink it later when it will be cooler which kind of matches my point. People got some strong opinions about coffee.

I wanted to start teaching our daughter responsibility around the house, especially because my husband had bone cancer, and had most of his pelvis removed and reconstructed, so he’s not going to be able to help much once he gets home. She just turned 3 in April and I had our second also in April, so she’s 3 months old now.

This is about to sound like I’m bragging and I don’t want it to, but I’m having so much trouble because she’s already a super responsible girl for only being 3, and she truly gets joy out of it. She started by just helping me, and I decided to incorporate our Skylight, so now she can get stars for a chore and earn towards a reward. Now, I have a great problem on my hands…she LOVES to do chores and wants to do more. I just don’t know what to add. She always puts her dirty clothes in the hamper as soon as she takes them off because it’s a habit I started long ago, she helps me put groceries away because she enjoys it, always throws her trash away, always puts her dishes in the dishwasher, puts her laundry away once it’s folded, so I’m out of ideas.

She currently helps me with:
-Feeding the dogs (AM/PM)
-Loading/unloading the dishwasher (AM/PM)
-Loading/unloading the bottle washer (AM/PM)
-Make her bed (AM)
-Prep coffee (PM)
-Put away shoes (PM)
-Toy cleanup (afternoon)

She does most of these alone, but I help with the stuff she can’t reach, I help with most of the glass, etc, but otherwise she’s pretty self sufficient. In total, this stuff takes about 30 minutes out of her entire day. I don’t want to give her a star for things like brushing her teeth, getting dressed, taking a bath, etc. but things that are actually “extra” so to speak. 

What else can I get her to help me with? I’m kind of at a loss for other items. Should I start just giving her stars for things she’s already doing, like helping with the groceries or putting her laundry away? Or should I just keep the routine we have now? I don’t want her to ever feel like it’s too much. Right now, if she tells me she doesn’t want to do one of those things, I just say okay and I do it because I was going to do it anyways. She just doesn’t get a star for it towards her reward. Any other ideas? They also don’t have to be daily, they can be like once or twice a week items!

I have been to therapy and it truly made me feel much better, but there are moments when I am exposed to certain triggers that it causes everything to go back to zero to the point where my mind starts playing tricks on me. And it happened that it started with going to a funeral a couple of days ago, someone I didn't even know that well but somehow being in that setting, looking at their pictures, celebrating their life had touched my heart and I felt their loss too and it just felt too much. 

Fast forward same day I get to chat with my favoritest person in the world (my mood always gets better thanks to them) and we ended up looking back at old photos and as I was looking down the memory lane what started as a pastery photos from a place I used to go to frequently that I wanted to show them ended up being a gut wrenching feeling that ruined my night, I couldn't even keep up with the conversation nor listen to what they were saying. How sharing my favorite pasty with my mom while she was in town would never happen again, how me waiting impatiently to give her my first shitty pottery work with a ""I <3 you mom"" turned into my husband throwing it in the trash because it was sitting out too long (I was air drying it to fire it and paint it) so she never got to see it. The last family dinner we had together, how my dad always walked fast and left her behind just like how he left her suffering and in pain before taking her to the ER. All it took was photos to make me relive my loss. 

But today, my friend invited me to a 5AM hot Pilates session which was a torture :') but got me an early birthday gift as a reward because they are going to be out of town on my bd. It was a moka pot (they knew I wanted one for ages but couldn't buy it). I haven't used one since I got married because my husband always found something to say whenever I wanted to buy one so I never did and I just drank instant coffee at home. Mind you in my culture we are coffee lovers and coffee was a big part of my life, I would wake up to a breezy Mediterranean morning and the smell of freshly brewed coffee, hearing the last tiny sounds of the moka pot boiling. I would sit with my mom at the table in her plant room, listening to birds singing and and to her being proud and how her new plant grew a new baby leaf or ""how beautiful the new flower of that succelent is"". My mornings were the most peaceful part of my life and I just got to relive that in a positive way for once. I mean every sip I took was a little salty because I was sobbing but at least they were happy tears and it ended up being a good cry that made me feel at peace. 

I am big on giving gifts to my loved ones, sometimes with no occasion but more like they needed this and I've been told I am a good at picking up the right thing but I think I got a glimpse of how something can be so meaningful and I am incredibly grateful for that. I miss my mama every single day and I will try my best to see every single memory of hers as happy rather than feeling sad. ",2,1754923804.0,GriefSupport,1,1.0,False

1mnf1hq,https://i.redd.it/mdn5cfvcleif1.jpeg,Is this truly who YIMBYs are? Displacement forward Gentrifiers?,"My take is Yes, this is how YIMBYs are viewed by all but non affluent centrists. But if you, like me, have joined and interacted with the Yimby membership of the orgs big and small, this isn’t who we want to be. Embracing the full toolbox including inclusionary zoning, social housing and renter protections is what the people not leading the orgs, but embracing the pro housing future believe. 

Our one size fits all free market urbanism is too big capital focused. Mamdani is a great example of someone who inspires people precisely because he is People First not Yimby in his urbanism (even Yimbies supported him and his absolute belief in renter protections). 

The last two weeks I have come here to challenge us to be more than right leaning free market affluence focused urbanists. 

Yimby is the dominant urbanist self identifier. We should CARE about displacement as a metric of success. We should CARE about left leaning economic theory. We should CARE about the working class and underresourced. 

People~First urbanism. New YIMBYism. A YIMBYism that cares as much about our neighbors as it is does units added. A movement that wants to increase supply through more than new builds. By conversions, by policy that makes long vacancy on investment properties unprofitable, by preserving affordable stock while we add new stock.

So I have an espresso machine and an electric grinder I bought last month.
I bought Lavazza crema gusto. But I made the mistake of ordering it via Amazon and it was packed in May.

 The beans at the top of pack were good. But as the 500 gram started depleting it smelt extremely burnt and the coffee wasn't so good anymore. Also, this coffee tasted much better from a moka pot than an espresso machine. 

Anywho,  wanna buy coffee beans for my espresso machine.  Please recommend. 

Im thinking Blue Tokai. I'd like maybe some vanilla or fruity flavors? But would they work good in an espresso machine?

So I always have been reading about water for coffee. After having seen how magnesium can improve my coffee, I went to the lab and made my own concentrate of magnesium chloride (among others).

MgCl2*6H2O - 203.3027 g/mol - 10.17 g in 89.83 g of distilled water (giving a total of 100 g concentrate)
0.2 g of this concentrate add 10 ppm when added to 1 liter of water.

When I add just a drop (0.05g) of this concentrate to my post brew coffee (brewed with bottled water, a good brand for coffee), it gives a very salty taste, staying in the back of my mouth for a long time.

My question : do users of Lotus water, or other brands, have experimented the same salty taste? Did I miss something?

## Key Features Analysis

The quality of chai powder is largely persistent by its ingredients, spice blend, sweetness, and ease of use.These features often dictate the overall flavor profile and how easily the chai can be prepared at home.**Spice Blend:** The ideal chai powder boasts a diverse and well-balanced blend of spices. Classic chai spices include cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, cloves, and black pepper. The proportions of each spice significantly impact the overall flavor, ranging from a sweet and mellow chai to a spicy and bold blend.

A good spice blend will provide warmth and complexity without overwhelming the palate. Powders with additional spices like star anise or nutmeg may offer unique flavor variations. Some manufacturers are also experimenting with blends containing turmeric,an ingredient known for its health benefits.

**Sweetness Level:** Many chai powders include a sweetener,often sugar,honey powder,or artificial sweeteners. The sweetness level is a crucial factor for many consumers.Some prefer unsweetened chai powder to have complete control over the amount and type of sweetener added, while others appreciate the convenience of a pre-sweetened blend.

The type of sweetener also matters; some consumers prefer natural sweeteners like honey powder or maple sugar over refined white sugar or artificial options. Understanding personal sweetness preferences is key to selecting the right chai powder.

**Ingredients Quality:** The quality of the ingredients directly impacts the flavor and aroma of the chai.High-quality chai powders typically use fresh,whole spices that are ground just before blending. Look for brands that specify the origin of their spices, as this can be an indicator of quality.

Organic ingredients are also desirable for some consumers, ensuring that the chai powder is free from pesticides and herbicides. Additionally, consider whether the powder is free from artificial flavors, colors, and preservatives.

**Ease of Use:** Chai powder should be easy to incorporate into various beverages. Look for powders that dissolve easily in hot water or milk without clumping. Some powders are designed for specific brewing methods, such as use in espresso machines or cold brewing.Convenience is especially critically important for those seeking a quick and easy way to enjoy chai. Powders that require minimal effort to prepare are ideal for busy mornings or on-the-go consumption.

**Texture and Solubility:** A good chai powder should have a fine, consistent texture that dissolves easily in liquid. Powders that are too coarse may leave a gritty residue, while those that clump easily can be tough to mix properly.

The solubility of the powder affects both the taste and the overall drinking experience. Powders that dissolve completely provide a smoother, more uniform flavor distribution.

## Core Benefits

Chai powder offers a convenient and tasty way to enjoy the numerous benefits associated with chai tea. From its warming properties to its potential health benefits, chai powder can enhance your overall well-being.**Warmth and Comfort:** Chai tea is renowned for its warming and comforting properties, especially beneficial during the colder months. The combination of spices like cinnamon, ginger, and cloves creates a soothing sensation that can help to alleviate chills and promote relaxation.A warm cup of chai is the perfect way to unwind after a long day or to cozy up on a cold evening.

The aromatic spices in chai also contribute to its therapeutic effects. The scent of cinnamon, for example, is known to reduce stress and improve mood.Enjoying a cup of chai can be a simple yet effective way to boost your overall well-being.

**Digestive Aid:** Many of the spices found in chai powder, such as ginger and cardamom, have long been used as digestive aids in traditional medicine. Ginger helps to ease nausea and promote healthy digestion, while cardamom can relieve bloating and gas.Drinking chai tea after a meal can definitely help to stimulate digestive enzymes and improve nutrient absorption. For those with sensitive stomachs,chai powder offers a gentle and natural way to support digestive health.**Antioxidant Properties:** Chai tea is rich in antioxidants, which help to protect the body against free radical damage. Spices like cinnamon and cloves are particularly high in antioxidants, contributing to the overall health benefits of chai.

Antioxidants play a crucial role in preventing chronic diseases and supporting a healthy immune system. Incorporating chai powder into your diet can be a delicious way to boost your antioxidant intake and protect your cells from damage.

**Energy Boost:** Chai tea contains caffeine,providing a gentle energy boost without the jitters often associated with coffee.The caffeine in chai comes from black tea, which is typically included in chai powder blends.The combination of caffeine and spices in chai can help to improve focus, alertness, and overall mental performance. Unlike coffee, chai provides a sustained energy boost that is less likely to lead to a crash later on.

## FAQs Section

Consumers often have questions regarding chai preparation,storage,and ingredients.Here are some frequently asked questions to help you navigate the world of chai powder.

**How should I store chai powder to maintain its freshness?**
To maintain the freshness and potency of chai powder, store it in an airtight container in a cool, dry, and dark place. Avoid storing it near heat sources or in direct sunlight, as this can cause the spices to lose their flavor and aroma. Proper storage will help to ensure that your chai powder retains its quality for as long as possible.

**Can I use chai powder to make iced chai?**
Yes, chai powder can be used to make iced chai.Simply dissolve the powder in a small amount of hot water to create a concentrated chai mixture, than add it to cold milk or a non-dairy option along with ice. Stir well to combine and enjoy a refreshing iced chai on a hot day.Some powders may dissolve more easily than others in cold liquids, so its best to experiment to find the best method.

**Are there any caffeine-free chai powder options available?**
Yes, there are caffeine-free chai powder options available. These powders typically use herbal blends or decaffeinated black tea as a base. Look for products specifically labeled as ""caffeine-free"" or ""herbal chai"" to ensure that they do not contain caffeine.

**How much chai powder should I use per serving?**
The amount of chai powder to use per serving typically depends on the brand and your personal taste preferences. Start with the recommended serving size listed on the product packaging, and then adjust the amount to your liking. Generally, 1-2 tablespoons of chai powder per cup of liquid is a good starting point.

Its sleek design paired with practical features has been a game-changer for my morning ritual. On my kitchen counter, this coffee press is as much a centerpiece as it is a brewing machine.

**Design and Build Quality**

There’s something undeniably stylish about the stainless-steel build that blends beautifully with its real wood handle. The green color is subtle yet adds a modern charm. This coffee press doesn’t just look good—it feels solid in hand. At 2.12 pounds, it has the kind of weight that screams durability. The high-quality 18/8 stainless-steel construction ensures there’s no rusting over time, which was a big concern for me with previous coffee makers. Having used it day after day, I can already tell this French press stands up to repeated use like a champ.

**Ease of Use**

Operating a French press might sound intimidating for some, but this one keeps things refreshingly simple. The manual operation mode puts all the control in my hands, from the coffee ground-to-water ratio to the steeping time. The ergonomic handle deserves a special nod—it’s not just for show. My cousin, who has arthritis, was able to grip it comfortably without worrying about the hot surface. It’s thoughtfully crafted for anyone to use.

**Key Benefits**

**Performance and Functionality**

What sets this coffee press apart is how well it keeps the coffee hot. The double wall insulation ensures the heat stays inside and doesn’t transfer to the exterior, a feature I’ve come to appreciate during long mornings working from home. It keeps the coffee warm for hours—plenty of time for my partner and I to enjoy it without rushing. The dual-filter system is a winner. There’s no grit in my cup, and the smoothness of the brew rivals what I’ve had from high-end cafés­. Even tea works great in it, adding versatility to its appeal.

**Positives**

- Retains heat four times better compared to glass French presses.
- Ergonomic, real wood handle combines practicality with aesthetics.
- A robust dual filtration system provides a clean and aromatic coffee experience.

**Areas for Improvement**

Despite its overall quality, there are a couple of things worth mentioning for transparency. The lid design, while functional, could fit a bit tighter. Occasionally, a small amount of steam escapes. Plus, cleaning the dual-filter system takes more time than I expected. These aren’t deal-breakers but might be slight inconveniences for some.

- Lid could benefit from an even more secure fit.
- Cleaning the dual-filter system can be slightly laborious.

**Product Alternatives**

In comparing this coffee press to other well-known contenders, the most obvious rival is the Bodum Chambord French Press. The Poliviar outshines with its thermal retention, thanks to the insulated double wall. If you often multitask while sipping your coffee like I do, those extra minutes of heat retention make all the difference. However, the Bodum scores points for being easier to clean, with its simpler single-filter mesh. BonVIVO’s French press is also worth a look if you prioritize aesthetics and sleek design, but it doesn’t match Poliviar’s durability or insulation capabilities.

**Cost-Effectiveness**

Given its build and performance, this coffee press offers reassuring quality without breaking the bank. While there are lower-cost alternatives, they often come with compromises in heat retention or build longevity. This feels like a long-term investment in enjoying better coffee at home. For someone who brews daily, it’s easy to justify the cost relative to competitors.

From the darkest places to the brightest lights. To the unseen trauma we both held  out of sight. You showed your light at full blast. I tried to shine. I've never shined like others.
 Sometimes I think it's a curse. I never intended pain, but that doesn't mean I didn't cause it. I hear alot about love being so many things. I'm not sure what to believe. I know your doubts are fortified like fort Knox. Rightfully so. I just don't understand how you can't see that I really have loved you. I know you doubt it and don't believe it, I know I betrayed you and don't deserve you. But I thought love would find its way. Now everyone's telling me love isn't enough. Well what is? 

We both Had our days, and we're there when each other was down. I'm sorry I couldn't make it right, an I'm sorry for the sorrys. You taught me not to take anything for granted.

 Because now I've lost everything. It's all I can do to get out of bed and work. I thought we would make it, but I was only fooling myself. You tried to tell me you couldn't get over it, but we pretended so well. God why couldn't we keep trying therapy? Why did we let ourselves loss each other?

 I always dreamed of someone who wouldn't give up on me. But I pushed it too far. Only so much anyone can take. Now I sit here, battered and bruised, just like you. I know you think I faked it all. But I didn't, I wish i had in a way. Because this wouldn't hurt. But it does, like nothing I've felt before. I probably would've put up with too much abuse. Because I couldn't leave someone I had such overwhelming feelings for.

 I wish I would've fixed myself before i met you. Now I have to wonder how 2 people can be in love for the rest of there life and not be together. You won't even speak to me now. Love should prevale. But even love can only handle so much. But when it's dark, I still see your candle shining through the darkness. But when I approach, nothing is there.

 I'd drop everything just to have more time with you, even though I know it won't ever happen.

 I dream of us finding each other in our 40s, 50s and 60s even, with heavy hearts and an open embrace. Hopefully we received a lifetime of love in between. Maybe we can sit in the nursing home together, have our last meals and tv shows together, and be visited from the adults that grew distant from me because I wasn't able to see them grow. I'd live a whole life time,  in the hopes of just one day like that. I'll always be here. I'm not joking when I say that. I believe in something and that is love prevailing. Maybe it doesn't, and I've been shown there's a great chance it won't.

 But I'd live a lifetime just to be able to gaze into your eyes again. I can't fix the past, but we can grow from it and learn. Love doesn't disappear,  it doesn't move on. It works itself back together, when done right. I think alot of people mess up relationships without meaning to. I don't think that means they don't love the person. It means they have problems they need to fix. Those aren't always workable on other people's timeliness unfortunately.

 An zero guarantees we even wake up tommorow. Hopefully if that happens, it's me and not you. Because you have a beautiful family to watch and grow old with. I hope you shine so bright I can see you anywhere. Even when I am gone. I'll have a special place In heaven were we can tell our stories if that's the case. Now if I ever told you I was over you it would be a lie. I won't ever get over it. If be lying if I ever even pretended I could have a day without you, and not be hoping for a knock on the door. It may never happen. But my soul has a special connection to yours. I believe you feel the same. To my dearest K. Don't let your light dim, please. I use that ight to get through the darkness. Just like your favorite movie series.  Forever sorry I hurt you, but I'll prove it this time. Even if it's too late. Just don't forget, I'm always here. I always will be. My door I will never close on you. Because love doesn't let go, it stays no matter what. Even if you let go, it doesn't. I know I'm not welcome in your life anymore, but your always welcome in mine.

 There will be a big juicy burger waiting on you, as well as vanilla candies and all your other favorites like coffee monster. It may be  a waste, but I'd rather waste with the best intentions, then to never give you a thought again. Holding you close forever and ever,  regretfully your dearest T

          4. lowest heat setting I can get on my stove 

            5. wait until the coffee starts to brew and cut the heat or keep the flame at its lowest setting until about half way i’ve found works better on this Moka.

Testing the AQUA CREST AQK-PF-01A was an interesting experience, primarily for how effortless its installation process turned out. Advertised as a replacement for all Waterdrop Pitcher Filtration Systems, this filter not only claims to handle contaminants effectively but also promises a long service life—something I value highly given the constant hustle of keeping my family hydrated with clean water. The moment I replaced the existing filter in my pitcher, I genuinely noticed a difference in water clarity and taste. It's a big deal for someone like me who perpetually chases that perfectly balanced filtered water.

**Upgraded Design and Materials**  

One of the highlights of this product is the design. Compact and lightweight at just over a pound, it fit perfectly in my Waterdrop pitcher. Made of durable plastic with ultra-high absorptive ACF (activated carbon fiber) technology, this filter introduces a game-changing absorption rate—ten times that of ordinary filters. As someone deeply motivated by sustainable living, it resonated with me when I read it can replace up to 1600 standard 16-ounce plastic bottles. That’s a dramatic reduction in probable waste over time.

[Ready to snag AQUA CREST AQK-PF-01A? See Amazon’s price.](https://aquagroove.com/p/b0c5d772vm/)

**Quality of Filtration**  

The filtration efficiency genuinely lives up to the hype. Scientists or perhaps filtration wizards behind this filter created magic with it being tested rigorously for reducing PFAS, PFOA, chlorine, odor, taste, and even heavy metals. The noticeable improvement in taste reminded me of that rare purified water you get in fancy resorts—you know, the one where you're shocked water could taste that clean. Everyone in my household, including my kids, commented on the improved clarity and ""fresh"" flavor.

**Long Service Life: A Practical Edge**  

Another significant feature that adds convenience is its long lifespan. Filtering up to 200 gallons before needing a replacement seems like a blessed relief for busy folks like me. It impressed me that a single filter saved me from purchasing hundreds of plastic bottles, consequently cutting down unnecessary errands to the store. This durability felt especially reassuring in months where I barely have time to track finer household details like water filter changes.

**Super Fast Flow Rate**  

Let me tell you; the flow rate on this model also does stand out! Some filters make you wait what feels like an eternity for water to pass through, but this one ensures a quick pour at 0.3 gallons per minute. This faster flow rate subtly became my savior during those chaotic weekday mornings when both coffee and hydration rush became life essentials.

**Winning Points**  
- Impeccable filtration capabilities, tackling heavy metals and chlorine.  
- Long-lasting, filtering up to 200 gallons or 3 months.  
- Easy installation and impressive speed with high-flow output.  
- Sustainable choice—reduces plastic waste significantly.  

**Hurdles**  
- While efficient, it's designed to fit a very specific range of Waterdrop pitcher models.  
- No indicator or alert feature for replacement timing; you’ll have to track manually.  
- Pricing tends to float higher compared to generic pitcher filters.  

**Competing Brands**  

When comparing this to other pitcher water filters in the market, several things become clear. Brita, being a household name, offers a more extensive product range and simplicity. However, its filters don’t measure up to the AQUA CREST’s level of heavy metal reduction. ZeroWater, another top-tier competitor, links its filtering efficiency with a massive five-stage process, but the flow rate tends to lag significantly—it’s just not as quick. AQUA CREST holds a unique appeal with its fast flow rate and its eco-friendlier design by way of long-lasting capacity.

Competitors like PUR put solid emphasis on lead reduction but fall behind on ultra-high absorptive ACF technology. Each has its merits, but this particular water filter seems to merge elite functionality and minimal maintenance requirements, giving it an edge in practical everyday living.  

**Smart Spending**  

Looking at the price through the lenses of both sustainability and longevity, it's clear that this product represents a case of affordable quality. It costs more upfront than other entry-level filters, but when measured against its extended lifespan and environmental perks, the difference is justifiable. You get cleaner water, fewer replacements, and long-term savings tied to reducing plastic waste—all without constant maintenance interruptions. It’s hard to argue against its value proposition when you weigh these aspects together.

This 12-cup coffee maker is designed to make brewing coffee as simple as flipping a switch. If you're someone who loves waking up to the comforting aroma of fresh coffee but hates fiddling with complex machines, this might be the one for you. However, like all products, it’s packed with features, both appealing and a bit underwhelming, depending on your priorities.

**Ease of Use and Design**  
The simplicity of this coffee maker instantly stands out. I appreciate its clean, no-nonsense design that doesn’t bombard you with a dozen buttons and settings. With its compact size (approximately 9.2""D x 12.3""W x 13.6""H), it fits snugly onto my modestly-sized kitchen counter without taking up unnecessary space. The white finish gives it a classic kitchen-friendly aesthetic, though I’d recommend keeping a cloth handy because it does show stains a bit more easily than darker models. What truly caught my attention from day one was the feature called ""Grab-A-Cup Auto Pause.” Imagine pouring a cup mid-brew without having to clean up a small flood afterward. Genius!

**Functional Performance**  
Let’s talk about how this thing brews. The Mr. Coffee SK12-RB lives up to its promise of making a rich-tasting pot of coffee. It’s not one of those ultra-speed brewing machines, but it’s reliable, and the quality is consistent. The reusable filter is a huge plus for me—saves money and cuts down on waste, which my environmentally conscious self can’t argue with. However, as someone who occasionally experiments with fancy blends, I noticed it sticks closer to a traditional drip coffee flavor. If you’re looking for an espresso-alternative or strong brews, you might be left wanting.  

**Highlights**  
- The ""Dual Water Window"" feature is incredibly practical. Being able to see the water level from both sides? It’s one of those things you don’t realize you need until you’re preventing an overflow.  
- The indicator light for power on/off is a lifesaver for forgetful folks like me. Has it saved me from walking out of the house with a heater running unnecessarily? Absolutely.  
- The ""Lift & Clean Filter Basket"" makes cleanup ridiculously easy. Bonus points from someone who’d normally let used grounds sit too long because cleaning feels like a chore.  
[Grab Mr. Coffee SK12-RB at Amazon for the best price.](https://ngadgets.com/p/b002yi49h6/)  

**Bad Points to Consider**  
There’s no such thing as a perfect product, and this coffee maker doesn’t pretend to be one. Here are a few areas that caught my attention:  
- It’s manual, which means you don’t get programmable features like delayed brewing. If you value automation, this might feel like a step back.  
- The carafe doesn’t pour as smoothly as I’d hoped. Occasionally, I spill a bit while trying to get that last drop.  
- It’s relatively basic when compared to higher-end coffee makers that come with additional settings for varied coffee strengths.  

**Peer Products**  
When comparing it to other budget coffee makers like the Black & Decker 12-Cup Thermal Coffee Maker or the Hamilton Beach Programmable Coffee Maker, the SK12-RB stands in a solid spot for simplicity. Black & Decker offers a thermal carafe, which is fantastic for keeping coffee hot longer, but I find those models noisier in operation. Hamilton Beach? Sure, it’s programmable, but I’ve seen more complaints about its durability than I’d like. What sets the SK12-RB apart is its reliability and straightforwardness. It doesn’t promise to do everything but excels at producing good old-fashioned coffee conveniently. 

**True Value**  
Considering the features packed into this coffee maker, it comes off as a smart investment for anyone needing a dependable machine without bells and whistles. Sure, there are fancier options out there that might tempt you, but they often come with sticker shock and features you may not use. This one does precisely what it’s designed for and doesn’t charge extra for frills. If you’re someone who just needs a solid drip coffee without over-complications, it’s worth every penny.

I’m also not allowed to wear certain underwear to work??? Never really understood but keep quiet to prevent an argument.
Recently I started working nights so he can return to work, we had no childcare and he was desperate to leave the house. I understood this I was a sahm while nursing my last kiddo. 
We both work full time
If I catch up on sleep on my days off, he gets mad that I don’t spend time with him and accuses me of “being on fb, and texting other guys”.
I even stayed awake to make him breakfast, got morning coffee and stayed awake till the evening enjoyed the day with some pool time and all. 
I kind of understood, it was also his day off. But I stayed up as long as I could. But I am still a jerk cause he used to work nights to?:|I’m so exhausted. A few years ago I lost my job and he decided to leave his too because he hated it so much. But he decided to go back to the same job? This just erks me, not sure why. Now he hates his job again it’s been 2 months. Because I was the only one working when we went to buy a second car, I went for a cheaper car. It’s what I could afford. I won’t lie, I don’t like driving it. I’m trying g to get over this. I worked so hard for so long i have an ick about being in a cheaper car. ( I know this is toxic and unhealthy, I’m far from perfect)
But he gets so mad at me, even know both cars are in my name, I was the one who payed for them both for so long. He’s worked maybe 1 year total in the last 4-5 years. I thought he would be grateful, but I also fucked that up too. 
We never got married and I wonder if that’s the universes plan…
He constantly accuses me of cheating. Everything I do I wrong. Our sex life is great, we have sec almost everyday, even after all these years. 
Evertime we “split” he blames everything on me, threatens suicide. Leaves without even kissing the kids. I’ll be left with the responsibility of all the bills and kids.
I’m at my wits end though. I have never related so much to “my teas gone cold, wonder why Iv got out of bed at all”
I can’t find the enthusiasm in anything anymore. I’m afraid to leave. Who will watch my kids. How will my kids adapt. Am I selfishly wanting….
I’m depressed, in a crossroad, and hopeless no if there is an out to this…
I think I wanna leave. I’m exhausted. I don’t know if the grass is greener, or how I’d even make it out to the yard…….",3,1754922648.0,whatdoIdo,7,1.0,False

1mnejeo,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1mnejeo/meds_interacting_best_with_insomnia/,Meds interacting best with insomnia?,"I (28F) am just diagnosed and soon going on meds. I have an appointment to discuss meds in a few days. The issue is, I have insomnia already- it's quite bad at the moment. I know there are both stimulant and non-stimulant meds, and I'm much more inclined to try the stimulant ones (non-stimulate meds apparently take time to work and the effect 'builds up' and is long-lasting, and the consultant said they can help with emotional dysregulation ... The thing is, I kind of like my happy extremes and excitability about things. I dont want a long lasting med that will dampen down my vibrant personality, spontaneous dancing etc. I just want something that will help me to focus at work when I need to).

So I'm worried about Ritalin or Vyvanse making my insomnia worse, but was wondering- has it actually helped anyone with sleep? Like, I'm wondering if being more stimulated during the day can help u crash at night. I know for myself with coffee, if I drink a tonne of coffee in the morning I will sleep better than if I drink none at all 😅🥲. So I'm looking for some personal experiences; I know what Google says and what the consultant will likely say- that stimulant meds can cause insomnia. But Google and any Dr would also say coffee would cause sleep disturbances, whereas it helps me if I have it before noon. So would love to hear any personal experiences on this. 🫶🐥",1,1754922601.0,ADHD,3,1.0,False

1mneilq,https://i.redd.it/sr4b4bgvgeif1.jpeg,The OG - 308 Rocks Glass,"Here at BenShot we like to look back and reflect on the past, and appreciate where we came from. From a father and son team working out of a garage to a 65,000 sq ft warehouse with more than 40 employees within 10 years. It’s moments like this that we like to highlight that glass that started it all: The OG 308 Rocks Glass. 

**The .308 Rocks Glass:**

An 11-ounce whiskey glass with a real, lead-free solid copper .308 bullet embedded within the wall of the glass. Each bullet insert is CNC-machined from a pure piece of copper by Lehigh Defense in Clarksville, Texas. Our glasses are high-quality, heavy, and handcrafted in our workshop in Wisconsin. All packaging and raw materials are made in the USA. Each glass comes individually packaged in a custom display box ready for gifting. 

Our .308 bullet can be embedded into a wide variety of glasses including; shot glasses, rocks glasses, wine glasses, pint glasses, and coffee mugs. We also offer custom laser etching services to get you that unique glassware no one else has.

**The “Bulletproof” Collection:**

Building on the success of our .308 rocks glasses, we've expanded our ""Bulletproof"" line to include a wider range of calibers, such as the .50 Cal, .45 ACP, and the expanded .45 round. We've also added beer mugs and decanters to our glass options. 

**The Perfect Gift:**

Our “bulletproof” glasses make a special gift for drinkers of all styles, gun enthusiasts, hunters, and collectors of conversation starting barware. Perfect for birthdays, anniversaries, Father’s Day, Mother’s Day, retirement, graduation, Christmas - or to just surprise a patriot you know!

**Get yours now:** [Make every drink taste like freedom!](https://benshot.com/collections/benshot-bulletproof-glasses/products/bulletproof-rocks-glass?variant=15148657479)

**Fun Fact:**

The .308, or the .308 Winchester, is one of the most popular rifle rounds in the world. Not just for hunting, but also for long-range target shooting and even military sniper applications. Introduced in 1952, it was originally developed for the U.S. military as the 7.62x51mm NATO round, and prized for its accuracy, manageable recoil, and ability to take down game from deer to elk. 

So when you see a .308 bullet embedded in a glass, you’re looking at a piece of ammo with over 70 years of history and a serious reputation in both civilian and military circles.

1mnei2w,https://www.reddit.com/r/PowerCheck/comments/1mnei2w/what_makes_the_best_rice_cooker_imusa_worth/,What Makes the Best Rice Cooker IMUSA Worth Buying or Skipping,"Testing out the IMUSA USA GAU-00011 Rice Cooker has been quite an experience. As someone who loves experimenting in the kitchen, this compact electric rice cooker intrigued me with its promise of simplicity and versatility. I’ve tried using it for a variety of meals, ranging from basic white rice to adventurous recipes like jambalaya, and it’s fair to say this gadget has a blend of strengths and a few quirks.

**Stylish and Practical Design**

What immediately caught my attention was the sleek and modern white exterior. Though it’s lightweight and compact, it feels sturdier than I initially expected. The nonstick aluminum cooking pot has been a game-changer for me—cleaning up is genuinely effortless, which is always a relief during busy weeknights. Plus, the removable pot made both serving and washing up a breeze. Its small footprint is perfect for kitchen counters, and I can see why it fits snugly in dorm rooms or RVs. 

**Culinary Versatility at Its Best**

This device isn’t just about cooking rice; it’s surprisingly versatile. I’ve successfully made oatmeal, stew, and even quinoa in it. The measuring cup and serving spoon that came in the box weren’t just accessories—they added to the overall convenience by ensuring I got the perfect portions every time. While I initially thought it would be limiting with its advertised 3-cup uncooked capacity, it yields up to 6 cups of cooked rice, which has been more than enough for small lunches or dinner gatherings for up to three people. 

**[Check IMUSA USA GAU-00011 price on Amazon.](https://alluringdeals.com/p/b008g00fyc/)**

**Convenient Functions for Everyday Use**

The “Warm” feature deserves a big thumbs up. I’ve had days where I cooked rice early in the evening and found it still warm and fluffy hours later—a lifesaver when work schedules get chaotic. This really shone during lazy weekend mornings too, when heated oatmeal was still at the ideal temperature as I made coffee. That said, a timer or preset options would have been a cherry on top for those seeking a more tech-savvy option.

**Advantages**

- Compact size fits small spaces like dorms or RVs effortlessly.  
- Nonstick cooking pot ensures seamless cooking and cleaning.  
- Warm function maintains the perfect serving temperature for hours.  
- Accommodates diverse culinary options apart from just rice.  

**Negatives**

- The absence of a timer or delayed start feature might be a limitation for some users.  
- A larger capacity option would benefit families or meal preppers.  

**Challengers**

Compared to other rice cookers in this price bracket, such as the Aroma 6-Cup or Dash Mini Rice Cooker, I’d say it holds its ground quite well. The Aroma model, for instance, boasts a sauté-then-cook function, which this one lacks. Meanwhile, Dash Mini specializes in vibrant design options, whereas the warm, modern elegance of the IMUSA rice cooker easily blends into minimalist kitchens. That being said, the IMUSA cooker’s versatility aligns more closely with other mid-range competitors while offering a comparatively lower-cost introduction to electric rice cookers.

**Cost Efficiency**

For the features packed into this neat unit, I’d say it hits a sweet spot when it comes to affordability. It’s hard to find kitchen tools that deliver such consistent results within this price range. If you’re searching for a budget-friendly, user-focused device that covers your basic meal needs, this one might just be a steal!

1mnehwi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EduHub/comments/1mnehwi/how_to_check_for_plagiarism_before_submitting/,How to Check for Plagiarism Before Submitting Your Work?,"In the world of academia, being original isn’t just a nice-to-have. It’s absolutely crucial!

Even a hint of accidental plagiarism can result in lower grades, academic warnings, or even more serious consequences. That’s why it’s so important for every student to learn how to check their assignments for plagiarism.  
  
Whether you’re crafting an essay, a research paper, or preparing a presentation, here are some tips to ensure that your work is completely your own.

# 📝Grasp What Plagiarism Really Means

Plagiarism goes beyond just lifting text verbatim. It can also involve:

* Borrowing someone else's ideas without giving them credit
* Paraphrasing too closely to the original wording
* Neglecting to cite your sources
* Reusing your previous work without permission (self-plagiarism)

Understanding these guidelines can help you catch issues before your professor does.  

# 📝Utilize Trustworthy Plagiarism Checkers 

Before you hand in your work, make sure to check it with a reliable plagiarism detection tool. Some popular choices are:  

* Turnitin (often available through universities)
* Grammarly Premium
* Quetext or Scribbr for quick assessments

A solid tool will compare your writing against millions of sources, pointing out any similarities so you can either rewrite or properly cite them.  

# 📝Double-Check Your Citations and References 

Even if a plagiarism checker gives you a clean bill of health, incorrect or incomplete citations can still land you in hot water. Ensure your references adhere to the required style (APA, MLA, Chicago, etc.) and that every borrowed idea is properly credited.  

# 📝Master the Art of Paraphrasing 

Just swapping out a few words won’t cut it. Genuine paraphrasing involves grasping the concept, rephrasing it in your style, and adding your insights. All while making sure to cite the source.

# 💡Seek a Second Opinion

If you're feeling a bit uncertain about whether something might be considered plagiarism, it's a great idea to have someone else take a look at your work. [Nerdify](https://gonerdify.com/?rd=x1d7y0) can assist you in reviewing your draft for proper citations, checking the structure, and making sure you're conveying your ideas in your unique voice, so you can submit your work with confidence.

# 📌Final Tip: Make It a Habit

Incorporating plagiarism checks into your writing routine should be as regular as your morning coffee, not just something you scramble to do at the last minute. With a bit of practice, you'll find that your writing flows in a way that's both original and academically solid.",1,1754922504.0,EduHub,0,0.67,False

I wanted to reach out and ask what places y’all would recommend! & no need to answer all of them, if you can only answer one or two I’d appreciate it!! 

- favorite local coffee shops? I love a quick grab n go place, but I’d also love to see a few places I can chill out at! 

- pastry shop? 

- do you guys have any good Filipino restaurants? If so, which ones do you recommend? 

- Mexican food? (Will have my grandparents with me, and they’re a bit picky. If you guys have any good authentic taquerias or Mexican spots it would be so helpful!!) 

- I went to the zoo years ago, is it still cool? I also think I visited a museum in the same area.

- is the gateway arch accessible for elderly people? (Would love to take my grandparents up there!) 

- any baseball related things there outside of the stadium? (Taking my grandpa to the cardinals game on Saturday :-) ) 

- favorite local pizza spots? 

- is the cathedral basilica worth seeing? It look’s beautiful, would like to stop by for the purpose of the architecture alone.

- vintage/thrift stores?? 

- shopping in general, good malls or maybe something “upscale”? 

- isn’t there like a mid century modern furniture store in downtown somewhere? Has anyone been? 

- and finally: is union station worth seeing? My grandparents loved the one in KC!

Most important I purchased oral probiotics.. this is a game changer. In addition to the normal daily women’s probiotics. I take both at night after I brush. I let the oral probiotic dissolve in my mouth.  

In the morning I scrape my tongue, floss and push on my tonsils to remove any stones. Haven’t seen any in a while since I started doing this routine. And they don’t smell. Next, i gargle with warm salt water. Then I brush and use Therabreath mouthwash.

At work, after morning coffee I gargle with warm saltwater. After lunch I brush then gargle with warm salt water. I follow my morning routine in the evening before bed. 

This helped so much and my mouth feels fresh, ears and nose feel unclogged all day. Tonsils are much smaller.

The final issue I have is a white coated tongue that I scrape daily.. but I think it’s because of my iron deficiency anemia and I’m sure I’m deficient in other areas so I will get tested because I want my to look normal.

1mneev9,https://www.reddit.com/r/JapanTravel/comments/1mneev9/trip_report_autumn_in_japan/,Trip Report: Autumn in Japan,"My wife had to go to Tokyo for work last November, so I flew in on her last day of meetings and we spent the next 12 days traveling along the north side of Honshu, down to Kyoto, over to Fukuoka, and back to Tokyo.  I had a new camera and lens setup so was really excited to capture the fall colors.  Suffice to say that Japan was absolutely gorgeous at this time of year, and I think fall might be my favorite time to visit.  Hope this report will be helpful to others looking to do a similar trip.

We’re in our 30s and experienced travelers.  This was actually our third trip to Japan in 2024 – once to go skiing at Niseko early in the year, and once in the spring for cherry blossoms – but we lived in Asia at the time and had moved back to the U.S. in the summer.  Time tends to be more of a constraint than money, and we like to be comfortable while traveling without going crazy on luxury hotels and the like.  We tend to fill out the schedule without a lot of downtime and don’t mind long days.

**Some logistical notes:**

-	Hotels – I made about half our reservations on Booking and the other half directly.
-	Internet – I have a Google Fi phone plan and high speed data was seamless as soon as I landed.  My wife rented a hotspot from a kiosk at the airport since she arrived earlier.
-	IC cards – Not sure if Suica card availability is still an issue (maybe at the airport?), but I had no problem getting them at Tokyo Station.
-	Trains – I think it has been well covered here, but since the price increase, the JR Pass wasn’t worth it and I bought all our train tickets individually.  I booked Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen tickets on SmartEx and linked our Suica cards to the tickets.  The app is pretty clunky, feels like an early 2000s interface and can be buggy with accepting some credit cards.  Regardless I was able to link a Chase Visa card and it got the job done.
-	Maps – Download offline maps on Google just in case.  Interestingly, Google would sometimes give different directions on my phone (Android) than my wife’s (iPhone).  Generally mine seemed to be more accurate and quicker, especially when transferring on multiple trains/buses.  Would also suggest grabbing an app called Organic Maps and getting offline maps on that.  It uses data from OpenStreetMap and has a lot more granular detail on certain things like hiking trails.
-	Car rental – A bit more of an arduous process than in any other country I’ve visited.  Rented one car in Kanazawa from Nissan and another in Fukuoka from Avis through their websites.  Make sure you understand exactly what documentation is needed and bring hard copies.  For most foreign driver’s licenses, you need an International Driving Permit.  In the U.S. these are only issued by AAA and are valid for one year.  There were some other quirks like needing to fill up the fuel before return at specific approved gas stations within a certain radius of the car rental office, and showing the agent the timestamped receipt.  Anecdotally, the Nissan was a newer car with better features like integrated Android Auto.  The Avis car – a Honda Fit, I believe - was a bit older and more basic.

**Day 1 – Tokyo**

Landed in the afternoon, got a ticket for the Narita Express at the airport, rode to Tokyo Station, and checked in at the Hotel Monterey Ginza.  My wife had been at a hotel in Shinjuku for work so she moved her bags over.  I saw on socials that an old friend was also on vacation in Japan, and in an incredible coincidence, it turns out she was staying at the exact same hotel.  The three of us went for a sushi dinner at the Mitsukoshi in Ginza.  Afterwards, we met up with another couple that we’re good friends with who happened to be in Tokyo on their own trip, and stopped at a sake bar.

**Day 2 – Kurobe Gorge**

Took the Hokuriku Shinkansen to Kurobe and transferred to a local train to Unazukionsen.  It’s a tiny place, so everything is within walking distance.  We rode the [Kurobe Gorge Railway](https://i.imgur.com/IzefhK9.jpeg) and were rewarded with [spectacular views](https://i.imgur.com/flVtk7R.jpeg).  The gorge walls are steep, so I think the optimal timing is between 10am and 2pm when you’ll have fewer shadows.  Try sitting on the right side leaving Unazukionsen and the left side for the return trip to get the best views.  There are multiple vantage points in town where you’ll find iconic views of the [rail bridges]( https://i.imgur.com/n2YECIT.jpeg).  Rail service was only to Nekomata because of damage from an earthquake in 2024, but the route beyond Nekomata to Kanetsuri and Keyakidaira is supposed to re-open some time in 2025.  Back in town we went to a konbini to grab dinner and were surprised to find a [troop of monkeys]( https://i.imgur.com/VR9wmvY.jpeg).  There were about 25-30 in total wandering around foraging like they owned the place.

We stayed at a ryokan called the Unazukionsen Yamanoha and I didn’t see a single other foreigner there.  It’s a larger ryokan but still quite traditional – I have a few tattoos and asked the staff if I would be able to use the onsen, to which they politely said it wasn’t possible.  I wasn’t surprised but a bit disappointed as it hadn’t been an issue on previous trips to Niseko and Hakuba.  There is an option to reserve a private onsen for 1650 yen to get around this though.

**Day 3 – Kanazawa**

Dropped our bags at the Daiwa Roynet Kanazawa Miyabi next to the main station in the morning.  We spent the day exploring the city, starting off at [Kenrokuen](https://i.imgur.com/vjZx8F6.jpeg) which is renowned as one of Japan’s Three Great Gardens.  It rained off and on throughout the day but we [got lucky]( https://i.imgur.com/3bEtD2U.jpeg) and the [clouds parted](https://i.imgur.com/DaqzzDR.jpeg) for a bit.  [The gardens](https://i.imgur.com/WMd4UEj.jpeg) are [absolutely serene](https://i.imgur.com/hMCsdpU.jpeg), and there’s even a [small waterfall](https://i.imgur.com/Df2rerP.jpeg) feeding one of the ponds.  Before leaving Kenrokuen we stopped at Seisonkaku and then made the short walk to Kanazawa Castle.  In the afternoon we took a bus to the tea district, Higashi Chaya, and [sampled some teas](https://i.imgur.com/wQADoZF.jpeg) and Japanese desserts at Sabo Issho.  There were some things we missed like the geisha experience and Nagamachi samurai district, so I hope to get back to Kanazawa in the future.  Note that the city buses don’t accept Suica cards – we had to pay cash.

**Day 4 - Gassho-zukuri Villages**

Picked up a rental car and spent the whole day visiting these UNESCO World Heritage sites.  It was overcast and drizzling most of the time which created a wonderful fall atmosphere.  Started in [Ainokura](https://i.imgur.com/5kVHg2e.jpeg), the smallest of the three villages.  We mostly had the [village to ourselves](https://i.imgur.com/whFw5s4.jpeg), which would not be the case later – especially at Shirakawa!  There are a few short trails in [the hills](https://i.imgur.com/KTKrqqX.jpeg) around the village that we explored before moving on to [Suganuma](https://i.imgur.com/NsSFFw8.jpeg).  The traditional [thatched roofs](https://i.imgur.com/UMP7oOj.jpeg) are remarkable.

We got to [Shirakawa](https://i.imgur.com/UNjTL0j.jpeg) around 2pm and had to wait about 45 minutes just to get in the parking lot.  This is the largest of the three villages by far and has some food options and souvenir shops.  We wrapped up right as they were closing down [at dusk](https://i.imgur.com/o13AaAy.jpeg) and headed back to Kanazawa.  There are dozens of tour buses dropping people off throughout the day, so if I had to redo our itinerary I’d have gone to Shirakawa first to try and beat the crowds.  This was a Saturday and a holiday (Labor Thanksgiving Day) to boot which probably exacerbated things.

**Day 5 – Kyoto**

Over to Kyoto where we left our things at the Granbell Hotel before heading out.  Most of the day was spent north of the city at Kuramadera.  It is a [long uphill walk](https://i.imgur.com/dIimtIm.jpeg) to the temple that takes maybe 90 minutes depending on how often you pause to take in the [beautiful pathway](https://i.imgur.com/594KY5C.jpeg) and [shrines](https://i.imgur.com/kEkSYXh.jpeg) that dot the mountainside.  The [crowds thin out](https://i.imgur.com/eo5izoY.jpeg) towards [the top](https://i.imgur.com/BP9f2Dq.jpeg) where you have the option of returning the same way back to Kurama station or taking a trail down the other side of the mountain.  We opted for the latter and [found a friend](https://i.imgur.com/R5BgID0.jpeg) before stopping at [Kifune Shrine](https://i.imgur.com/XPxpAMB.jpeg).  I was not expecting Kifune to be such a big attraction, but there were absolute hordes of people there.

The walk down to Kibuneguchi station is another 20-30 minutes on a paved road next to a stream with more gorgeous scenery.  That night we met up with my friend from the sushi dinner in Tokyo to see the [night illumination](https://i.imgur.com/Q5HpXwE.jpeg) at Nijo Castle.  There are better night illuminations in Kyoto to see the fall colors, but I hadn’t been to Nijo Castle before so it was a good way to end the day.

**Day 6 – Kyoto**

My wife was drained from the last few days so she grabbed a few extra hours of sleep while I woke up early and headed to Fushimi Inari.  We’ve both been there before but experiencing the sunrise was a different experience altogether.  I made it to the top around 7:15am, and by 7:30am the [lighting was perfect](https://i.imgur.com/U6MObiy.jpeg).  After a bit of time hanging out with [the foxes](https://i.imgur.com/i5q8QMY.jpeg) and taking in [the scenery](https://i.imgur.com/gvAYYBc.jpeg), I [continued on](https://i.imgur.com/821anyE.jpeg) to the [“secret bamboo trail”](https://i.imgur.com/PQLIQvQ.jpeg) and got back to the entrance at 9am where people were streaming in by the hundreds.

I met up with my wife at Enkoji, which may be my favorite temple in Kyoto proper now.  Enkoji was founded by Tokugawa Ieyasu, made famous in the West as the deuteragonist in the Shogun book (my favorite novel) and recent TV series (an excellent adaptation), in the 1600s.  It requires advance registration, which helps to keep the crowds manageable, and tickets cost 1000 yen.  The [rock garden](https://i.imgur.com/NyczDRC.jpeg) at the entrance gives way to a [tranquil tree garden](https://i.imgur.com/1SflNms.jpeg) with [stone lanterns](https://i.imgur.com/yCmB90W.jpeg) and [other ornaments](https://i.imgur.com/pNRZFRB.jpeg).  One of the highlights is a [Jizo statue](https://i.imgur.com/A00t95P.jpeg) in the central garden.  [Walk up further](https://i.imgur.com/Q6Ode6b.jpeg) and you’ll find a small bamboo forest, a cemetery, and some nice views of Kyoto.

We moved on to the Philosopher’s Path and on a whim ducked into Hakusasonso.  The entrance fee was a bit steep at 1300 yen, but this private garden was [almost entirely deserted](https://i.imgur.com/W4OMisG.jpeg) – the only people we saw was a couple doing an engagement or wedding photo shoot.  [Honenin](https://i.imgur.com/wO7VSUp.jpeg) and [Shinnyodo](https://i.imgur.com/ih9Ovpw.jpeg) are both free and were relatively uncrowded.  The central [pagoda](https://i.imgur.com/tIBl1IS.jpeg) at Shinnyodo dominates the courtyard.  As late afternoon approached, we found ourselves at Nanzenji.  It’s free to enter, but I think it was worth the 600 yen fee to get an [elevated vantage point](https://i.imgur.com/pkolxcZ.jpeg) at [Sammon Gate]( https://i.imgur.com/lFfJlcC.jpeg).  Nanzenji is also notable for the photogenic [Suirokaku Aqueduct](https://i.imgur.com/BW7AjYi.jpeg).  Rather than exit through the main entrance, you can take a hidden path from the aqueduct to leave from the back which will take you to Keage station.  After getting dinner downtown, we retraced our steps to see [Eikando at night](https://i.imgur.com/C9SpM9p.jpeg) for 700 yen.  This has a well-deserved reputation as one of the most impressive night illuminations in Kyoto, and the [crown jewel](https://i.imgur.com/9YkOxRb.jpeg) is Hojo Pond.  Although it is very popular, we found the temple had quieted down a lot by the time we got there at 8pm and it was a really pleasant walk through the grounds.

**Day 7 – Kyoto**

I had gone back and forth on whether to visit Tofukuji.  Tsutenkyo Bridge is known as THE place to see the leaves turning, but I’d seen some horror stories about how packed it can get and a ban on photos to keep people moving and avoid dangerous situations.  There is a way to get an early admission ticket to enter an hour before it opens to the general public, but I couldn’t figure out how to navigate the system – I think you may need to be a resident of Japan.  My wife convinced me to go anyway, and is usually the case, she made a great call.  Tsutenkyo was not nearly as bad as I feared, and if you are patient you’ll get plenty of time to [enjoy the colors](https://i.imgur.com/5lp1YlI.jpeg) and take all the photos you want.  Tofukuji is free although there is a 1000 yen fee for Tsutenkyo.

Next we had gave our feet a break with a workshop at Yamada Tatami.  I’d seen it recommended on other posts here, and this was one of the highlights of the trip.  The shop owner’s son, Masaki-san, [leads the demonstration](https://i.imgur.com/bC2g2lP.jpeg) and helps you make a small souvenir tatami to take as a keepsake.  Traditional tatami is a dying craft in Japan so we were happy to support the business.  It was easy to book online, and the shop assistant Cheryl-san translates everything into English and will take a bunch of photos and share them afterwards.

We then headed to the monkey park in Arashiyama.  By the time we got there it was raining steadily, and we weren’t sure whether it was worth the 600 yen and a long uphill walk if the monkeys would all be taking shelter.  Turns out that they [don’t give a crap](https://i.imgur.com/HSz6tUb.jpeg) about the weather and [go about their business](https://i.imgur.com/blR0RZv.jpeg) rain or shine.  I had to [admire the tenacity](https://i.imgur.com/e1Ec1eh.jpeg) of even the youngest members of the troop.  Before turning in for the night I stopped in Gion, where the drizzling rain gave it an [ethereal atmosphere](https://i.imgur.com/94WZ4Pg.jpeg).

**Day 8 – Fukuoka**

Took the Shinkansen south and checked in at the JR Kyushu Hotel Blossom Hakata Chuo midday.  After lunch, we visited the Ishikura Sake Brewery.  They don’t offer tours but there is a showroom of sorts where you can get free samples and “try before you buy.”  We killed the rest of the afternoon at teamLab Forest (2400 yen) before going to the [Kamado Shrine](https://i.imgur.com/xaQwKiB.jpeg) in Dazaifu, which does a night illumination during the fall.  This is very much off the beaten path in a sleepy area on the outskirts of Fukuoka.  The shrine is often visited by couples and people looking for love.  Entrance is free but the transportation options become pretty limited late at night.  We had to wait at the entrance for about 15 minutes before my wife was able to get a taxi through an app (GO).

**Day 9 – Interior of Kyushu**

Picked up a rental car and drove to the [Akizuki Castle ruins](https://i.imgur.com/yTkBtSi.jpeg) on our way to Onta Pottery Village.  Closer to Onta we made a quick stop at some [rice terraces](https://i.imgur.com/cvfUgUi.jpeg) where the clouds cleared up at the perfect time.  I had a bit of a tricky time getting into Onta as there are only two roads in, and one was closed but not marked on Google Maps.  Ontayaki pottery is all handmade to this day, with ten families passing down knowledge from generation to generation.  There is a free museum where you can learn about the history of the village before visiting the workshops along the main road.  Interestingly, none of the families sign their ceramics because they maintain a collective identity.  We capped the night off at Citadel, a cocktail bar full of character that has attracted attention after appearing in a [NYT piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/21/travel/fukuoka-japan-a-guide-to-food-and-culture.html) about the culinary scene in Fukuoka.

**Day 10 – Tokyo**

We decided to leave Ohori Park for another trip and hopped on the Shinkansen up to Tokyo.  I got first class tickets (the “green car”) since they were only a bit more than regular tickets.  The green car isn’t vastly different from economy other than being in a 2x2 configuration where you can reserve seats, and I wanted to sit on the left side to see Fujisan.  JR scaled back dining options on the Shinkansen a few years ago, but in the green car you can still order drinks and snacks to your seat through a QR code.  The selection is pretty basic, but it’s a good fallback option to get coffee or tea and a light meal if you don’t have time to stop at a konbini before boarding.  We checked in at the Hotel Wing International Premium Tokyo Yotsuya, then after dinner saw the [superb night illumination](https://i.imgur.com/jPGmw49.jpeg) on Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue.  The upper half of the road is closed to vehicles in the evening and the lights go off at precisely 7:30pm.

**Day 11 – Mount Takao and Tokyo**

This time it was my turn to convince my wife to tackle Takaosan.  It was a Saturday and fairly crowded, but the [weather was ideal](https://i.imgur.com/Lj5Uzk2.jpeg).  You can do a steep hike from Takaosanguchi station or take a cable car partway up, which was about a 45-minute wait.  On the way to the top you can [make wishes/prayers](https://i.imgur.com/xV6XssN.jpeg) and appreciate [the figurines](https://i.imgur.com/cXcBSrd.jpeg) on the hillside.  The summit offers [unparalleled views](https://i.imgur.com/5jhojUz.jpeg) of Tokyo.  The cable car return to the train station had a massive line so we opted to walk all the way down.  At night we went to teamLab Planets (4200 yen) and got dinner at the Ippudo in the mall next to Shinjuku station, which is notable for offering vegan ramen.

**Day 12 – Tokyo and departure**

On our last day my wife peeled off to do some shopping while I went to see [Meiji Jingu Gaien Ginkgo Avenue](https://i.imgur.com/lVitF9G.jpeg) in daylight.  Our flight was departing from Haneda that afternoon but I also squeezed in a visit to [Shinjuku Gyoen](https://i.imgur.com/eep3TIo.jpeg) (500 yen), a [peaceful oasis](https://i.imgur.com/I2UOTEW.jpeg) tucked in between Tokyo’s high-rises.  After a last few moments admiring the [massive ginkgo trees](https://i.imgur.com/W9S9GQt.jpeg), it was off to the airport and back to real life.",17,1754922302.0,JapanTravel,2,0.91,False
