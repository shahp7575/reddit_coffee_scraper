We purchased our Bosch 800 superauto back in November and Out of no where the unit has started brewing less coffee and diverting a majority of the water to the drip tray, causing it to overflow. Initially it was just on the first drink we brewed after turning it on, but now it’s consistently doing it, with only one out of 5-6 drinks actually coming out.

We keep the unit clean, and have done the descaling, cleaning the brew unit, changing the filter, etc. 

Interestingly, this only happens when we brew something; no issues with the hot water function. I’ve googled and searched the internet for answers but keep ending up with “clean the unit”. Any one have experience with this issue or have guidance? ",1,1748369581.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

I have a 2bed, 2bath apartment in the inner city, which I'm currently renting on my own. The second bedroom is a fair bit smaller than the master bedroom, so it might not suit someone who had a lot of possessions - but it would be absolutely perfect for someone who didn't spend all their time in the city and just needed a central location to spend nights, with some decent storage and easy amenities (coffee machine, etc).

Has anyone either rented a room for an arrangement like this or been a person commuting between cities and needed accommodation on a long-term, part-time basis? Can you lend me any tips or ideas? Is there a place that people go for that?

If this ends up being too unrealistic I'll change my approach but to begin with I'd just love to explore it out fully.  ",1,1748369579.0,Wellington,0,1.0,False

1kwubay,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1kwubay/two_friends_28f_visited_me_after_years_and_now_i/,"Two friends (28F) visited me after years, and now I feel like I’ve ruined both friendships — am I overthinking it, or is something off?","I (28F) live with my boyfriend (27M) in a big city. We’ve been together for 9 years, living together for 3. This weekend, two old friends visited me from out of town — “S,” (28F) a close friend since we were 11, and “T,”(28F) who became friends with us when we were 16-17. All of us grew up in a large city back home but now live in different places.



T(28F) lives alone in a small, isolating town and has to go into work every day. I work remotely. During the trip, she kept making comments like, *“You don’t understand how isolating it is,”* and *“You come home to someone every day — that’s different.”* I absolutely understand it’s hard to live alone — my brother has gone through the same. But it felt like she was attacking me for having a different life.



There were other things too. She wanted to invite her friend (28F) to join us for ice cream. That friend lived 20 mins away by public transport — but due to some construction, T claimed it was shut and said she had to walk 45 mins instead. But it wasn’t shut — there were replacement routes. Later, her friend told us she *chose* to walk because she felt safer, which made me feel like T unnecessarily blamed me.



T also kept asking for things asking for a home-cooked meal even though she was here only for a few days. I didn’t mind cooking, but S found it weird and suggested we order instead. It felt like T was treating my place like a hotel at times. She’s been to this city multiple times, while it was S’s first visit with her BF (28M), so I was trying to plan things S wanted to see. Still, T seemed bored and said she wanted to go home early because she was tired.



The night before T left, she made a heavy comment about how going back to her small town after being around people again was going to be a “bad trip.” She also brought up how her cousin felt terrible returning after visiting home. I empathize, and I’ve lived away from home too — but the way it was said made me feel like my life was being discounted because it’s “not as hard.”



After she left, I confided in S — I thought we were on the same page about how intense and odd the trip felt. Initially, we both agreed T had been acting off. But after I shared more *(and acknowledged I might be overthinking due to PMS or just general stress*), I noticed S pulled back. It felt like maybe I said too much and it changed how she viewed me. I even felt like S — who’s always been more well-off and polished — was trying to subtly one-up me. Like when I offered her my perfume and she just said, “No, I have mine,” in a way that came off… snobbish?



To be fair, I was running on little sleep, too much coffee and weed (not my usual), and I think the emotional buildup hit me hard. After they both left, I had a full-on breakdown. I felt like I ruined my friendships with both of them and like I’d failed as a host. The whole thing brought up feelings of homesickness I’d been suppressing for years.



Am I overreacting? Is it just PMS, exhaustion, and weed-induced anxiety… or are there real shifts in these friendships I should pay attention to?



TLDR: Two old friends (28F) visited me. One (T) made me feel attacked and overwhelmed; the other (S) was initially supportive, then seemed distant. I felt like a bad host and now I’m wondering if I’ve damaged both friendships or if I’m just overthinking everything due to stress.",1,1748369325.0,relationships,0,1.0,False
1kwu9hi,https://www.reddit.com/r/EDAnonymous/comments/1kwu9hi/how_long_did_extreme_hunger_last_for_you/,How long did extreme hunger last for you?,"The amount of time I’ve been dealing with extreme hunger is starting to feel unbelievable and I really just want to have a normal metabolism. I feel so guilty and embarrassing and definitely not like other people in recovery (or even like myself at the start of recovery) when I WANT to eat two or three huge meals and two to three also huge snacks per day to keep from going crazy from hunger and food noise. I’m not underweight anymore so it really just makes me look like I have no self control when I get an in-between meals snack (because I’m starving) or seconds (because I’m trying to keep from being hungry between meals but it doesn't work 😭). It seems like everyone else I know, even people with ""no issues"" around eating, only need coffee for breakfast, a sandwich for lunch, and a dinner they don't even finish, with no snacks in between. No one else seems to feel hunger or to need to restore depleted energy through eating, no one else finishes their meals, no one else needs breakfast, everyone tries to push off their next meal until as late as possible, etc. Obviously this used to work for me but these days it's like I’m constantly asking everyone around me if they're ready to eat now and they're still too full from their previous meal. I haven't been full more than a handful of times in weeks!! And then I’m hungry again by the next time it's time to eat!!

I’m gaining weight of course (I've been scared to weigh myself the past four days but last I checked it was about >!5 lbs in 10 weeks!<, although I wouldn't be surprised if I gained >!2-3 lbs!< of real, non-water weight fat and muscle this week from eating (and drinking 🫣) a lot several nights in a row), and I’m also exercising more so I feel like I look extremely bulky too. It feels so weird and unattractive to feel food bloating in my stomach underneath a wall of ab muscles that are themselves underneath a layer of fat.  

I feel pretty bad guilt and shame after every meal, like I’m betraying my old self and old body, and so basically always I go back into restriction for a few days (and most days I also don't eat dinner unless someone else is with me who expects me to eat), but I must just be burning through my energy reserves like crazy because I just end up starving and weak and dizzy way before I ever used to before I got serious about ""recovery"" (tbh I feel like this term stopped applying to me once I got past BMI >!18.5!< and now what I’m doing is just eating too much and making up excuses lol).  

When does this stop or am I just going to just be a bottomless pit gaining weight forever? I’m in my late 20s so it's not like it's second (or third) puberty and I'm going to just grow out of it lol. And I’m not even binge eating, just eating large, calorie-dense meals and several also calorie-dense snacks every day. I can at least be thankful that I’m not bloated at the end of every single meal now, but I’d like to also actually feel full for more than a few hours at time so I could get a break from the eating/feeling shame/restricting/exercising/eating because I’m unbearably hungry again cycle I have going now. Does this eventually go away on its own or is there anything more I can do except eat more reasonably when I’m hungry and stop when (or before) I’m full?

1kwu8zl,https://www.reddit.com/r/italianlearning/comments/1kwu8zl/bilingual_blitz_19_for_real_this_time/,Bilingual blitz [19] (for real this time!),"**THE RULES**

Without looking at the comments, can you provide translations for these short (**but challenging!**) sentences (3 English-Italian, 3 Italian-English)? I’ll evaluate your responses and give you feedback. The exercise is designed to be intermediate/advanced level, but beginners and lower intermediate learners are welcome if they feel like testing the scope of their current knowledge. *I might take a few days to answer* (usually up to around a week if there’s high participation) but I will read and evaluate all participants.

If you’re not sure about a particular translation, just go with it! The exercise is meant to weed out mistakes, this is not a school test!  
**If multiple translations are possible, choose the one you believe to be more likely give the limited context** (I won’t deduct points for guessing missing information, for example someone's gender, unless it's heavily implied in the sentence).

**There is no time limit to submit your answer**. If you want to go back to the first ever edition and work your way up from there, you can. Just know that I usually prioritise later posts.

**THE TEST**

Here are the sentences, *vaguely* ranked from easiest to hardest in each section (A: English-Italian, B: Italian-English).

**A1)** ""Wait, I’ll help you! That looks way too heavy""  
**A2)** ""I'll chase after him, you try and cut him off!""  
**A3)** ""I need the thingy - what’s it called? The corkscrew, that’s it!""  

**B1)** “I topi non avevano nipoti” (bonus: can you figure out why this sentence is noteworthy and find and English equivalent?)  
**B2)** ""Non lo scusare. Non se lo merita”  
**B3)** ""A parte che gliene avrei data comunque una, non è di questo che stavo parlando""  

**Current average**: N/A (median N/A)

**EVALUATION (and how to opt out)**

If you manage to provide a translation for all 6 I'll give you a score from 1 to 10 (the standard evaluation system in Italian schools). Whatever score you receive, don't take it too seriously: this is just a game! However, if you feel like receiving a score is too much pressure anyway, you can just tell me at the start of your comment and I'll only correct your mistakes.

Based on the results so far, here’s the usual range of votes depending on the level of the participants. Ideally, your objective is to score within your personal range or possibly higher:

**Absolute beginners**: ≤4  
**Beginners**: 4 - 5  
**Early intermediate**: 5 - 6.5  
**Advanced intermediate**: 6.5 - 8  
**Advanced**: ≥8  
**Natives**: ≥9 (with good English)  
*Note: the specific range might change a lot depending on the difficulty of this specific exercise. I try to be consistent, but it’s very hard*

**TO SUPPORT ME**

Since I've been asked a couple of times by now, I've recently set up a [Ko-Fi page](https://ko-fi.com/crown85469). If you appreciate what I do and want to offer me a coffee as thanks, feel free to do so. **Only** donate if you have money to throw away: I'm doing this because I like it, any money I get from it is just an extra bonus and I won't treat people differently based on whether they decide to donate or not, it really doesn't matter to me.

**IF YOU ARE A NATIVE ITALIAN SPEAKER**

You can still participate if you want (the exercise is theoretically symmetrical between Italian and English), but please keep in mind that these sentences are designed to be particularly challenging for *non* native speakers, so they might be easier for you. For this reason, I’d prefer it if you specified that you are a native speaker at the beginning of your comment: I’m collecting statistics on how well learners score on these tests in order to fine tune them (and personal curiosity), so mixing up the results from natives and non-natives will probably mess it up.

Naan oru 19M Sikh! (A sikh, not punjabi mind you!) It's been 6 months since I arrived here with already 23% percent tamil vocabulary which was basically just “seri”, “saptingla”, and “aama”. I had arrived to my punjabi father and tamil mother (already oru post iruke for this) nd before I knew it, the City absorbed me. The city gave me so much, and even though the city is very chaotic, there are some diamonds in the rough here. I was scared shitless after seeing all the online fight on the language, but the people I met fortunately helped me improve my vocabulary.  The city has it's ups and downs for me.

✅ I can now understand 57% of Tamil, 23% of which is just “seri” and “aama”.

✅ I have started to like rasam in a glass and gulp it like a body desperate for liquid.

✅ I’ve accepted that traffic signals are a gentle suggestion, not a rule.

✅ My tamil has improved enough to be overcharged in 42 out 47 autos. I consider that character development.

✅ I’ve said “Siray, tamil konjum teriyum, naa english le paesla ma?” more times than I’ve said “I love you” in my life.

✅ Sunburn is skincare routine now. Everyday at 7.30 am I get free treatment.

✅ Filter coffee is daily routine. The word 'DEI!' springs out of my mouth unironically.

✅ I hum SaNa (lived here long enough to say 'SaNa' and not 'Santosh Narayanan') while crossing the road and pretend I am in a Karthik Subbaraj padam. I love 'my dear loveru' song, super funny.

✅ I love puli manga pulip song also, especially that line ""Nachi neechi navundutta chechi, steel-la body slim aai pochi."" By being able to speak tamil fast like the singers, my tamil has more flow and a 'kick' to it.

❌ I face stares every day in my life on the way to office (work). Some random people even shout the sikh line 'jo bole soinahal, sachri akaal' very loudly for no reason at all I have gotten used to it.

❌ **Not a lot of friends tho**, still have to catch up on that.

❌ It takes me 15 minutes to make the App bike riders understand that I can travel without a helmet nothing will happen, no fine will be charged. (I have saved the turban rule for helmet pdf on my phone home screen so I can show immediately)

❌ have to go for thalapathy or thalaiva fdfs (have gone for first day evening show, but never fdfs)

But yo, naan half-local dhaan! I love the shock face of the locals when I lip sync to jalabulajungu song perfect or jsut speak some tamil already. My english is getting worse tho, local accent already came in and ruining my english. Overall, this city is a 'sikh' city...get it? (sikh means sick here like as in cool)

Can we smoke in your car one more time?You can open the roof, Ill point out all the constellations I can find.  I wont tell you about the ones I mapped in the freckles between your shoulder blades. We will find the north star. You can tell me how it will always point me home when Im lost.

“One more time”

Can we just lay here for a little while longer, one more time? I will trace my fingers down your spine. Kiss the base of your neck. You can make us coffee in bed. You always knew how to make it perfectly, you never had to ask.

“One more time”

There was a time you liked me back and sure we were hooking up for months - but you are one of my best friends. You were always supposed to be my friend. We promised it was casual, that if things had to change we would always be honest. And then they did change. You knew I had liked you but I never told you I was starting to fall in love you.

“One more time”

Its not anger or jealousy when you talk about her. She isn’t your girlfriend, you aren’t exclusive and fuck maybe it wont work out. I want you to be happy. I know shes nice, shes pretty, she shares your hobbies. She sounds like everything you have said you wanted.

“One more time”

Its not anger or jealousy when you talk about her. Until I look at you and I see a life time of simple moments. I think about the constellations in your skin. I think about your sleepy eyes in the morning. Of how the same eyes  look after they cry. What would it be like to grocery shop with you, do laundry together, listen to you sing in the shower every night or hold you when the days get too long? What would it be like to show you how easy you are to love?

“One last time”

So for the last time can we have one more time? Can I have my best friend back before he is gone for good? Before its been 5 years and I cant remember what your laugh sounds like? We can play a game. We always talked about Monopoly. We can laugh, make food, watch movies. Ill run my fingers through your hair while you doze on the couch. I will softly whisper I love you as you fall sleep, for the first time. One last time.

A couple years ago, a guy I had liked for nearly a decade finally messaged me. We started texting, it was flirty, and we made plans for dinner. He canceled last minute and ghosted me for 5 months. Eventually, I reached out. He apologized, said he was busy living abroad for work. We started texting again for a few weeks, but it wasn’t flirty anymore. Then he ghosted again.

Four months later, I got a random call from him while a text came in saying he’d had a girlfriend for about a year and felt bad for what he did to *her*. On the phone, he rambled about how he’s been a mess and said we shouldn’t talk anymore. I replied saying I was hurt, and later sent him a letter being honest about how much it hurt but wishing him well. (Yes, it was emotional and a little cringe.)

Months later, I ran into him while he was visiting. We said hi, and he texted me later saying he wanted to start over and get to know each other again. I asked if he was still in a relationship, he said no. We started talking again, but he barely messaged me. I told him it was okay to back out if he wasn’t interested. He insisted he was, but claimed he was depressed and giving me “all he had,” which was honestly the bare minimum.

We eventually went for coffee, and it went really well. For about a day afterward, he texted like a normal human being. Then back to dry, distant replies. He returned abroad and didn’t reply to my message for days, said he’d been hospitalized for a bad cough. I wished him well and checked in, but his replies stayed cold. I called, no answer. I texted asking if he was alive, he instantly replied saying he wasn’t in the right headspace to talk.

Here’s where I might be TA: I had him blocked (you can still see when a blocked number texts via iMessage/mac), and I know he lied about messaging me after I sent the letter, nothing ever came through. He also lied about dumb things, like made-up interactions to sound cool. It was constant, weird, and unnecessary.

A week later, my friend and I prank-called him from a fake number. He answered and told her he had a girlfriend he loved and was going to marry, naming the same “ex” he swore he wasn’t with. The next day, I called him from the same number and told him it was me. I confronted him for lying. He made up a dramatic story about thinking it was his ex on the phone and that they were broken up but fighting. Still claimed they weren’t together.

I checked her social media and confirmed they were together on Valentine’s Day. I messaged him and said I wasn’t mad he had a girlfriend, I was mad he treated me like I was stupid. He half-assed apologized and ghosted again.

I saw him recently in public. He said hi, but never messaged after. I know prank-calling was immature, but I feel so pissed off. I gave him more grace than I’ve ever given anyone. I wanted this to work so badly. And I know I shouldn’t still hope he’ll reach out, but I kind of do.

We all grew up in a big city but now live in different places. I hosted them in the city I currently live in with my partner — it was supposed to be a warm, nostalgic reunion, but it left me feeling completely drained and disconnected.



One of them (**S**) was visiting for the first time, and I genuinely wanted her to have a great experience. The other (**T**) visits once a year for a few days, and during this trip, she expected a lot. She kept asking me for small things, even hinted she wanted a home-cooked meal. I didn’t mind doing it, but even **S** found it a bit much and suggested we order in instead.



Before **T** arrived, **S** and I were on the same page about how **T** can be — a bit much, a bit draining. But once **T** joined us, it was like that dynamic shifted. Suddenly, I was the only one noticing or reacting to the energy, and it made me feel confused and alone in my discomfort.



**T** invited a friend of hers to meet. She chose a place that was about 20 minutes by public transit, but while coordinating, she turned to me and said she’d have to *walk* 45 minutes because transit “wasn’t working.” It *was* working. There was some construction, but routes were open. By the end of it, we learned her friend actually preferred walking for safety reasons — but **T** made it sound like she had no choice and that I was somehow involved in that.



She kept saying she was tired and wanted to head home early every day. On her last night, she said, “Tomorrow’s going to be really hard,” meaning she’d struggle going back to her quiet life after being in a big city. She compared it to her cousin’s struggle after returning from home — and then turned to me and said *I* wouldn’t understand that kind of loneliness because I live with someone. Later that night, she added, “You don’t know what loneliness really is,” implying I couldn’t relate because I don’t live alone or work in-person full time.



I tried to empathize and offer support, but she kept shutting me down. It felt like she needed me to *not* get it — like I had no right to feel lonely or low because I have a partner and a stable setup. It made me feel guilty for simply being okay.



There were other small, subtle jabs too. Like when I offered my perfume and she replied, “I have my own,” in a way that felt performative. Or the way both of them reacted when I casually mentioned that I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because we don’t talk — they looked at me like I was being snobbish or cold. It felt weird to be judged for something that’s literally just digital hygiene.



By the end of the trip, **S** was no longer saying much about **T**’s behavior. She even seemed to flip sides a bit, which left me feeling completely isolated. I’d been exhausted — PMSing, sleep-deprived, running on way too much caffeine, and had smoked more weed than usual. I don’t normally drink coffee or smoke like that, and I definitely don’t function well without 8 hours of sleep. My body was wrecked, and emotionally I felt like I was spinning.



The night they left, I had a full-blown breakdown. I cried for hours. I felt like I’d lost the easy dynamic I had with **S**, and the whole trip just amplified how far away I feel from home. I missed it more than I had in a long time.



I don’t know if the friendship has changed, or if I’ve changed, or if the emotional load of being a host just cracked something open. But it’s been days and I still feel hollow.",0,1748368934.0,offmychest,0,0.5,False

I'm a L10 technology senior analyst in NA, currently on the bench for 5+ weeks. I'm planning to relocate soon and leave the industry and go to school for a completely different career next year.

I'm going to an in-person coffee chat with my people lead sometime over the next few week at the office.

I'm considering telling my PL that I'm planning to leave the industry next year. If they want to staff me on a role, that's fine, but I would exit the company when school starts. If they refuse relocation or if they don't like the idea of me staying on, then I would bring up a negotiated exit (severance) with my PL.

It would be nice to stay employed and get paid while waiting for school to start, but if they decide to cut me loose, that's fine too since I have a side business that needs my attention, and to be honest, I would rather be doing that then this (this is kind of taking too much time tbh).

I'm okay with either of these outcomes:
- they have a role for me to do after I relocate, and I work for a year max.
- they cut me loose with severance.
- stretch out my time on the bench before they cut me loose (not telling my PL any of my plans)

I'm hoping to not leave without severance (quitting).

I would like to arrange them somehow, depending on how many cards are arriving.

If you need some inspiration: She loves god and the gospel. She loves lighthouses as they represent in her eyes how gods light is guiding us. She loves flowers a lot. And princesses. And the series Outlander. Oh and the works in the labs on human genetics. Oh and she surely loves coffee and cakes .. big cakes... :)

So maybe there are some creative people out here that would like to help me out? I thank you all in advance since i already know that you people here are amazing!

  
All the LOVE!

Before Quinn could react, Alexander was by her side, grabbing her chin and then forcefully kissing her. How  to read a novel for free? Comment below and I’ll share the full link!","In the evening, Quinn Mellon prepared a table full of delicious dishes, waiting for her husband to come home for dinner.

However, until one in the morning, her husband still hadn't returned.

The clock on the wall kept ticking, silently narrating the long night.

The food on the table had long gone cold, much like Quinn's heart.

With a soft sigh, Quinn gathered the cold dishes and stored them in the kitchen, patiently reheating them, trying to retain a hint of home's warmth.

At that moment, the sound of the door opening echoed, and Quinn quickly turned around.

There stood a man in a suit, tall and handsome, walking in.

He had been drinking, stumbling a bit as he walked, but it was this slight intoxication that made his already handsome face even more charming.

This handsome, slightly drunk man was none other than Quinn's husband, Alexander Kennedy!

Seeing her husband return, Quinn quickly got up to greet him.

Quinn had whipped up a hangover fix for Alexander, but just as she passed it to him, he clumsily knocked it over, spilling it all on the floor.

Before Quinn could react, Alexander was by her side, grabbing her chin and then forcefully kissing her.

Subsequently, Alexander lifted Quinn up and headed towards the bedroom.

Clearly, Alexander was driven by lust; he sought someone to satisfy his desires.

Quinn was thrown onto the bed by Alexander.

Just as Quinn tried to get up, Alexander's body pressed down on her, pinning her firmly to the bed.

Alexander's strength was overwhelming, and Quinn couldn't resist.

Not only was her body unable to resist, but she couldn't even utter a word of refusal.

After all, she was mute, unable to speak.

Quinn had no choice but to give up resistance.

Alexander passionately kissed Quinn's neck and chest.

Seeing Quinn's lack of resistance or words, Alexander placed his hand on Quinn's cheek and asked in a low voice, ""Why don't you speak?""

Tears glistened in Quinn's eyes; she couldn't answer that question.

Being mute, she was destined not to moan like other women, to satisfy a man's pleasure in bed.

Why did Alexander ask this question when he knew she was mute?

Was he intentionally humiliating her?

Or was it due to some complex emotions?

Quinn didn't know what Alexander was thinking. All she could do was comply, fulfilling her husband's sexual needs.

Quinn began to kiss Alexander and used her slender fingers to caress his body...

Alexander soon felt the arousal; his cock in his pants was as hard as a rod of iron.

Alexander couldn't wait; he removed his pants, stripped Quinn, and thrust his rock-hard cock into Quinn's pussy.

Quinn furrowed her brows tightly, a hint of pain showing on her beautiful face.

Even though they had made love before, every time Quinn felt her pussy being filled to the brim.

Alexander's cock was just too big!

Being his wife was truly hard...

But after the brief pain, came the pleasure and ecstasy that sex brought

# Chapter 2

Sex was wonderful; even with a heart full of grievances, Quinn could still find pleasure in it.

Alexander had a great physique, and he and Quinn made love for a full hour.

Both immersed in the ecstasy of sex, they both reached climax...

When Quinn opened her eyes again, it was already the next morning.

Alexander was in the bathroom, leaving Quinn alone in bed.

After the passion faded, emptiness set in.

Quinn was in pain; she couldn't feel any love from Alexander, only his lust.

What did Alexander see her as?

A wife?

Or a whore?

As Quinn was about to get dressed, the phone on the bedside table suddenly vibrated.

It was Alexander's phone!

Someone had sent a message to Alexander.

Quinn glanced at it.

It was a message from a woman named Getty Morgan to Alexander.

Getty's message read: ""\[You promised to be with me tonight, why did you go back to that disgusting mute?\]""

Seeing the message, Quinn felt deeply distressed.

So, Alexander had come back so late last night because he was with another woman...

Just then, the bathroom door slowly opened, and Alexander stepped out after his shower.

Quinn quickly averted her gaze from the phone screen, pretending she hadn't seen anything, and continued dressing.

Alexander walked to the bed, picked up his phone, and glanced at Quinn, who was getting dressed.

""Did you see the message someone sent me?"" Alexander asked casually.

Quinn quickly shook her head.

She remembered what Alexander had told her on their wedding day: ""Don't fall in love with me. I'll take care of you, but don't expect more.""

Alexander had made it clear—no love.

So, even if she saw the message, what could she do?

Alexander never cared about her feelings, let alone whether she would be jealous, sad, or in pain.

Someone who isn't cared for has no right to be angry.

Her love, her emotions, to Alexander, perhaps they were just burdens...

Quinn gestured in sign language: ""I'll go prepare breakfast.""

With that, Quinn endured the soreness in her body, slowly got up, and headed to the kitchen.

Watching Quinn's frail figure, Alexander glanced at the phone and eventually deleted Getty's message.

Soon, Quinn had breakfast ready.

They sat together at the table in silence.

""Come with me to Kennedy Residence later."" Alexander suddenly spoke.

Quinn smiled and nodded.

Alexander looked at Quinn.

Quinn was always so obedient, always smiling no matter what. But her compliance seemed to erase her personality.

A person without a personality is truly uninteresting...

After breakfast, Alexander drove Quinn to Kennedy Residence.

Quinn was brought to Alexander by his grandfather, Ulysses Kennedy, who adored Quinn.

Three years ago, Ulysses was critically ill and ordered Alexander to marry Quinn.

However, at that time, Alexander was in love with another woman.

That woman was Getty, the one who had just messaged Alexander.

Getty and Alexander had grown up together, childhood sweethearts.

Although Alexander liked Getty, he dared not defy his grandfather's command and ultimately married Quinn.

Quinn loved Alexander, even though she couldn't express that love.

But Alexander didn't love Quinn.

A one-sided love in marriage is destined to be a tragedy.

Quinn deeply felt this deeply after marriage.

Alexander's heart wasn't with her; it was with that woman named Getty...

Alexander brought Quinn to Kennedy Residence.

It was a lively day at Alexander's home because his sister, Freya, had given birth to a son, and they were celebrating with a feast.

Quinn followed Alexander into the hall.

In the hall, Alexander's mother, Kaitlyn, was holding her grandson, smiling. But as soon as she saw Quinn, her expression darkened.

Clearly, Kaitlyn didn't like Quinn.

Quinn greeted Kaitlyn, who seemed to ignore her, engrossed in conversation with her son Alexander and daughter Freya.

Being ignored, Quinn didn't get angry; she just stood quietly on the side.

Freya glanced at Quinn and said, ""Look how cute the baby is. Why don't you and my brother have a child?""

Kaitlyn snorted, ""Having one mute in the family is embarrassing enough. If you have another mute, I won't be able to show my face!""

Upon hearing this, Alexander glanced at Quinn, who lowered her head, looking mournful.

Freya's mention of having a child was clearly a jab.

Last year, Quinn was pregnant, but Kaitlyn forced her to have an abortion for fear she would give birth to another mute child

# Chapter 3

When Alexander found out, he didn't step in to defend Quinn.

Under Alexander's pressure, Quinn had no choice but to terminate the pregnancy.

Quinn often wondered what life would be like if that child had been born; by now, the child would have been almost a year old...

Apart from Ulysses, no one liked Quinn, especially Freya, who harbored a deep hatred towards her.

Quinn entered Alexander's life at the age of five, and Freya, resentful of Quinn's favored status with their grandfather, bullied Quinn for her inability to speak. She would lock Quinn in storage rooms and even burn her hair with a lighter.

Once, Freya pushed Quinn down the stairs, and Alexander caught her in the act.

Alexander reprimanded Freya.

Already resentful of their grandfather's favoritism towards Quinn, Freya now found herself scolded by her beloved older brother for mistreating Quinn. How could she not hate her?

At that time, Quinn couldn't sign or write, let alone report the abuse, so Freya's torment only escalated, with any hint of displeasure from Freya resulting in Quinn bearing the brunt of her anger.

As they grew older, Freya no longer physically bullied Quinn; instead, she tormented her emotionally and mentally.

Freya would deliberately bring up pregnancy to remind Quinn of the terminated child, seeking to inflict pain upon her.

She was a malicious woman!

Alexander, feeling uneasy, stood up and said, ""Let's go!""

Confused, Freya asked, ""Brother, why are you in such a hurry to leave? At least finish your meal before going!""

""No, there's work at the office,"" Alexander said, pulling Quinn away without looking back at Freya.

Watching this scene, Freya grew even angrier, unable to understand her brother's actions.

Alexander's affection should have been for Getty, not Quinn. So why was he protecting Quinn?

Back in the car, Alexander lit a cigarette, showing signs of irritation.

Quinn sat quietly, waiting for him to finish smoking.

After he finished, Alexander turned to Quinn.

She remained meek, with a faint smile on her lips, like a servant awaiting orders from a master.

Seeing Quinn's lack of anger and her submissive demeanor, Alexander felt deeply uncomfortable.

He didn't like people without a backbone.

When someone is bullied or provoked, they should get angry!

Yet, Alexander also felt a pang of pity for Quinn. After a moment of thought, he asked her, ""What do you think about having a child?""

Quinn was momentarily surprised, then signed back: Your mother is right. What if I give birth to a mute child? It's better if we don't have one.

From childhood to adulthood, Quinn had learned a harsh truth: everything she hoped for would eventually shatter like glass.

The more beautiful the fantasy, the more painful its shattering!

Like the time she wanted a birthday cake as a child, Ulysses bought her one. She was about to make a wish when Freya pushed her face into the cake.

She lifted her head in embarrassment, cake smeared all over her face, surrounded by laughter from onlookers who found it amusing.

Quinn forced a smile, but inside, she was hurting.

Having endured so much pain, Quinn no longer dared to hope for anything.

Suddenly, Alexander remembered something and said, ""I remember not using protection last night. Maybe we could have conceived a child.""

Quinn signed back: I'm on birth control.

Alexander looked at her fingers as she signed. Her fingers, slender and long from constant movement, danced gracefully as she signed, a sight to behold.

After watching her for a moment, Alexander looked away, started the car, and insincerely said, ""That's good then!""

Quinn lowered her head.

Alexander dropped Quinn off at the coffee shop where she worked. As the car pulled up, he noticed Getty standing there.

Getty always found a way to locate Alexander.

Tall and stunningly beautiful, with long legs and curly hair cascading down her back, Getty commanded attention wherever she stood.

As she watched Alexander and Quinn step out of the car, her anger peaked, flames flickering in her eyes.

Getty's demeanor suggested she was the wife, and Quinn the mistress, but in reality, Quinn was Alexander's true wife!",1,1748368840.0,NovelNexus,0,1.0,False

Want me to let him know?"" The HR director's voice came through the phone, concern evident.  
  
Freya's eyes lowered as she replied softly, ""No need. Just leave it as is.""  
  
""But you've been his right hand for four years! He values you more than anyone and totally depends on you. Are you absolutely sure about quitting?""  
  
HR was practically begging, but Freya just offered a small smile.  
  
""Nobody's irreplaceable in this world. My parents aren't doing well, and I need to head back home to settle down. Since Mr. Whitemore approved it, I'll handle the transition. I'll be gone in a month. Thanks for checking.""  
  
After hanging up, Freya went back to sorting through her things. She'd lived in this penthouse for three years. Not too much stuff, not too little—just keeping essentials and tossing the rest.  
  
As the room emptied, she felt momentarily disoriented, memories washing over her like waves.  
  
Eight years ago, Freya—a small-town girl from a modest family—got into Harvard and became best friends with New York heiress Elena Whitemore.  
  
Despite their completely different backgrounds, they clicked instantly—attending lectures together, grabbing lunch, hitting the shops—practically joined at the hip every day.  
  
Gradually, Elena brought Freya into her world, introduced her to family, and unwittingly, Freya fell hard for Elena's brother, Jasper. But she buried those feelings deep, never breathing a word to anyone.  
  
After graduation, Elena took off to study in Paris. Freya stayed in New York, landed a job as Jasper's assistant—all to be near him.  
  
Then came that night when someone slipped something into Jasper's drink. Freya was about to call 911 when he pinned her against the wall, his control gone as his mouth claimed hers.  
  
After a night together, she woke to find him by the window, his sharp profile haloed in cigarette smoke, brooding and distant.  
  
Hearing her stir, he turned. ""You're into me, aren't you?""  
  
Freya instinctively wanted to deny it, but he continued, his face expressionless.  
  
""You blush whenever I walk in. You know all my likes and dislikes. You jumped at becoming my assistant right after graduation...""  
  
""Don't tell me that's all coincidence.""  
  
His words left her face burning, from embarrassment or guilt, she wasn't sure which.  
  
In the heavy silence, he suddenly handed her a card.  
  
""Last night shouldn't have happened. I'm in love with someone else and can't return your feelings or take responsibility. Elena mentioned you come from a modest background—there's enough money on this card to set you up for life. Let's both forget this ever happened.""  
  
Freya was stunned. Then she remembered he'd repeatedly called out a name in bed: Mia. Mia Carter.  
  
From Elena, Freya knew Mia was Jasper's unforgettable first love. He was so hung up on her that even after she dumped him and moved abroad, collecting a string of rumored boyfriends, he insisted on waiting for her return.  
  
Freya recalled Elena's eye-roll: ""The Whitemores are known for being cold fish. How did my brother turn into such a hopeless romantic? Waiting all these years, saying everyone else would be 'settling' because he refuses to settle.""  
  
Feeling this in her bones, Freya suddenly found her courage and called after Jasper as he headed for the door.  
  
""I don't want your money. I just want a chance. Please, just try being with me. If she never comes back or... if she does return but you still can't move on, I'll walk away. I promise.""  
  
Faced with her lovesick gaze, Jasper paused for a beat before muttering, ""Whatever,"" and walking out.  
  
From that day forward, Freya was his assistant by day and his lover by night. They left their mark in his office, his Maybach, against the windows of his penthouse. Four years passed with no one knowing about their arrangement, and she told herself she was happy.  
  
Until his birthday a few days ago. Freya had planned several surprises to celebrate. But as midnight approached, instead of Jasper, she got a notification from his social media—an account he'd never used before.  
  
""Best birthday gift? Getting back what I lost.""  
  
The forever-silent Jasper Whitemore had posted a photo of himself kissing Mia Carter beneath exploding fireworks.  
  
Seeing this, the blood drained from Freya's face, her chest tightening. With one last desperate hope, she called him.  
  
Mia answered. After saying ""hello"" several times to silence, she called out: ""Jasper, who's this Freya Kingsley calling you and not saying anything?""  
  
A moment later, his deep, cool voice came through the speaker: ""Nobody important. Ignore it. Come back to bed, babe.""  
  
In that moment, Freya knew her exit cue had arrived.  
  
She packed her things, ready to leave, when she ran into Jasper at the door. Since they'd been sleeping together regularly, Freya had been staying at his place for convenience—but now, she couldn't stay another night.  
  
Seeing her with her bags, his eyes narrowed slightly, but he made no move to stop her. ""Found a place?""  
  
""Yeah, my old apartment. Talked to the landlord—just for a month.""  
  
At this, Jasper frowned. ""A month? What for?""  
  
Freya started to explain, but he seemed to lose interest, merely saying, ""I'll drive you.""  
  
She tried to refuse, but he insisted.  
  
""It's dumping snow out there, and it's late. If anything happened to you, Elena would kill me.""  
  
Freya reluctantly got into his car. Once, they'd been intimate countless times in this vehicle, but now she barely recognized it. The interior was plastered with cute plushies, Hello Kitty seat covers, and snacks everywhere...  
  
She could hardly imagine this serious, standoffish man transforming his car into something so cutesy.  
  
Noticing her stare, Jasper offered a brief explanation: ""Mia's into this stuff.""  
  
Freya got his meaning and stayed quiet for a long while before responding softly.  
  
""You finally got her back. I'm happy for you, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
Jasper hadn't expected that response. His eyes darkened, and he said nothing more.  
  
Halfway to her place, Mia called, wanting to build a snowman with him. He pulled over, clearly eager to go to her, but hesitated when he glanced at Freya.  
  
Understanding his dilemma, Freya opened the door. ""I'll grab a Uber from here, Mr. Whitemore.""  
  
He nodded and got out to help with her stuff. Her hands slipped, and the box crashed to the ground. As he bent down, the streetlight illuminated its spilled contents, freezing him in place.  
  
Love letters addressed to him but never sent, candid photos she'd secretly taken, things he'd tossed that she'd rescued and treasured...  
  
Freya's heart hammered as she scrambled to gather everything.  
  
""Sorry about that.""  
  
Without a word, Jasper got back in his car and sped away.  
  
Freya waited in the snow for ages but couldn't get a ride. Trying to lug her box home, she was hit by an electric scooter.  
  
The collision left a nasty gash on her calf, blood staining the snow. Watching the hit-and-run driver disappear, she gasped with pain, lying in the snow for what felt like forever.  
  
When she could finally move, she limped through the snow for four hours before reaching her apartment.  
  
After patching up her wound, she checked her phone to find a message from Jasper, sent after he'd left:  
  
\[Stop being so obsessed with one guy. There are plenty of fish in the sea. Don't hang all your hopes on me.\]  
  
Freya stared at this message for a very long time.  
  
At dawn, she went downstairs, set fire to the box, and burned everything inside it. The love that had burned fiercely in her heart for eight years turned to ashes alongside those mementos.  
  
Jasper Whitemore, I'll grant your wish.  
  
Chapter 2  
  
After a quiet weekend, Monday morning rolled around, and Freya arrived at work on schedule.  
  
She handled her usual tasks, including notifying Jasper about his upcoming meeting. Approaching his office, she glanced through the partially open door and stopped cold.  
  
Mia was sitting in Jasper's lap, feeding him the other half of her cookie. The famously germaphobic CEO actually ate it with a smile, then gently kissed her fingertips.  
  
""You were talking about craving these yesterday, so I stood in line for three hours this morning. Worth it?"" His voice had a tenderness Freya had never heard before.  
  
""Mmm, they're perfect—sweet but not sickeningly so. You used to trek across town for these all the time. Now you're literally running a corporation. Can't you just send someone to get them?"" Mia wiggled her foot as he massaged her ankle.  
  
The look on Jasper's face was pure devotion. ""Anything that matters to you, I handle myself. Always.""  
  
Mia's face lit up as she wrapped her arms around his neck and kissed him. He pulled her closer, completely lost in the moment.  
  
Watching them, Freya felt like she'd been punched in the chest, a bitter ache spreading through her. Her fingernails dug deep into her palms, leaving bloody crescents behind.  
  
As the meeting time approached, Freya composed herself and knocked lightly.  
  
""Mr. Whitemore, your meeting's about to start.""  
  
Hearing her, Jasper tensed slightly and started to rise, but Mia tugged him back down.  
  
""Don't go yet. Five more minutes?"" She gave him puppy-dog eyes.  
  
Her playful plea melted his resolve instantly.  
  
""Push the meeting back two hours,"" he called out.  
  
This meeting involved a collaboration between major New York corporations that was crucial to the company's future. Freya knew its importance and couldn't help adding:  
  
""The CEOs from Verdean, Aurex, and Vireon are already in the conference room...""  
  
""God, Jasper, your assistant is such a buzzkill! Can't she take a hint?"" Mia rolled her eyes dramatically.  
  
Jasper's expression hardened instantly. ""I said postpone it two hours. Nothing comes before Mia, got it?""  
  
Freya felt like she couldn't breathe. In the end, she simply closed the door and walked away.  
  
Everyone in their circle knew Jasper was a workaholic machine. No matter what was happening personally—even right after surgery—he'd drag himself in to finish his work.  
  
Yet here he was, risking relationships with major partners because of a little whining. This was completely new territory.  
  
Did he really love Mia that much?  
  
Freya pulled herself together and walked into the conference room to face the waiting executives.  
  
The Whitemore empire was powerful enough that these CEOs, despite being pissed, wouldn't directly criticize Jasper. Instead, they unloaded on Freya.  
  
She took their verbal abuse silently, head down.  
  
After an excruciating two-hour wait, Jasper finally showed up. As Freya left the conference room on legs that felt like jelly, Mia called out to her.  
  
""You're Freya, right? Jasper says you make killer coffee. Everyone looks dead on their feet—whip up some for the whole floor? Mine with ice, no sugar.""  
  
Knowing her place in the hierarchy, Freya headed to the break room without protest.  
  
Two hours later, she finished preparing over four hundred cups, delivering them one by one.  
  
After just one sip, Mia's face darkened. She hurled her mug straight at Freya's head.  
  
The ceramic smashed against Freya's forehead, opening a nasty gash. She let out a gasp of pain and dropped to the floor, clutching her wound.  
  
Not satisfied, Mia grabbed more mugs and kept throwing them.  
  
Bruises bloomed across Freya's body as ceramic shards sliced her skin. Coffee soaked through her clothes, mixing with bright red blood dripping onto the floor.  
  
Despite the blinding pain, she could only curl into a ball, protecting her head and chest.  
  
The office went dead silent. Nobody dared step in as Mia continued her meltdown. They all kept their distance, watching in horror.  
  
The commotion brought Jasper out of his office. He surveyed the chaos and Freya's crumpled form with narrowed eyes.  
  
""What the hell happened?""  
  
Seeing him, Mia instantly switched to victim mode. ""Jasper, I asked her to make me coffee. I'm on my period, and she deliberately put ice in it. My cramps are killing me now.""  
  
Seeing her teary eyes, Jasper's face darkened immediately.  
  
""You've worked for me for four years and can't handle a simple coffee order? Or do you have some problem with Mia?""  
  
Freya raised her deathly pale face to explain, but he didn't give her the chance. He called over another assistant.  
  
""Dock her entire month's salary and quarterly bonus. Send a company-wide notice and have her make a public apology at next week's all-hands.""  
  
With that, Jasper draped his jacket over Mia's shoulders and led her away.  
  
Chapter 3  
  
As Jasper vanished down the corridor, the tears Freya had been fighting finally broke free.  
  
She forced herself up, wincing as she grabbed a broom and mop to tackle the mess of shattered ceramic and coffee.  
  
A few sympathetic coworkers came to help, their eyes full of pity.  
  
""I clearly heard her say 'with ice, no sugar.' How's she flipping this on you? Did you tick her off somehow?"" one whispered.  
  
""Like she needs a reason?"" another muttered. ""Everyone knows she's a total princess. Throws a fit over nothing. Half our circle can't stand her, but with Jasper in her pocket, nobody dares say boo.""  
  
""Man, I've never seen him this crazy about anyone. Freya, just watch your back. We're regular folks—we can't compete with trust fund babies. With Jasper backing her play, we just have to eat whatever crap they serve us.""  
  
Freya appreciated their support, but their words left her emotionally tangled.  
  
Once, when a client tried blaming her for their own mistake on a contract, Jasper had stood rock-solid behind her. He'd believed in her completely, fighting until her name was cleared.  
  
But now? Mia drops one casual lie, and he doesn't even fact-check or let her explain. He just assumes she's at fault.  
  
After years of dedication, handling countless fires for him—didn't she deserve that basic trust?  
  
Or in his world, did right and wrong not matter as long as Mia was happy?  
  
The thought left her heart feeling like raw hamburger.  
  
It took forever to clean everything before dragging her battered body home.  
  
She had barely stepped out of the shower when her phone lit up with Jasper's name.  
  
""Bring over some Advil and heating pads.""  
  
She threw everything together ASAP and headed to his penthouse.  
  
In just days, the once sleek space had transformed completely. The cherry tree his grandfather planted—gone, replaced by tulips. The black and white furniture he'd always preferred—swapped for pink and yellow pieces he used to mock. Display cases now showcased jewelry, designer bags, and gifts...  
  
Pure Mia, through and through.  
  
Freya took it all in silently before knocking on the bedroom door.  
  
Jasper opened it, grabbed the stuff, and finally glanced at her face.  
  
With the coffee cleaned off, her injuries looked brutal, making him pause.  
  
""Jesus. Have you had that checked out?""  
  
Freya just shook her head.  
  
He rubbed his temple, his tone softening slightly.  
  
""Look, Mia was just feeling like garbage. She wasn't gunning for you specifically, so don't take it personally. I'll add what I docked from your pay to your Christmas bonus. Get those wounds looked at—if they're bad, take a few sick days. I'll sign off on it, no red tape.""  
  
""That won't be necessary. At the end of this month—""  
  
Freya tried telling him about her resignation, but he cut her off, shoving a card into her hand.  
  
""Just do what I'm telling you. I need you to put together a welcome-back thing for Mia, so rest up and heal.""  
  
The words died in Freya's throat.  
  
She nodded, took the card, and turned to leave.  
  
As the door swung shut, she caught Mia's voice:  
  
""Babe, is that tea ready? Can you come rub my stomach?""  
  
""Coming right now. Just lie still and don't move, okay?""  
  
Hearing his tender tone, Freya smiled bitterly.  
  
Her own cramps were brutal too—she'd actually passed out at work multiple times and been rushed to the ER.  
  
When he found out? Just a signed time-off form. No visits, no tea, no heating pads.  
  
Back then, she'd told herself he was swamped with work.  
  
Now she got it—he just didn't give a damn.  
  
After leaving, Freya hit up urgent care for basic treatment.  
  
She crashed at home for a few days before getting bombarded with party specs from his assistant.  
  
Everything from floral arrangements to dessert selections to server uniforms came with ridiculous requirements.  
  
With just three days to pull it off, Freya pushed through her exhaustion to make it happen.  
  
After running herself ragged, the party kicked off at 7 PM sharp.  
  
Mia floated in wearing some couture masterpiece, immediately becoming the room's center of gravity.  
  
Guests swarmed her with compliments, feeding her ego.

We met on a dating app. Its been 3 months of us texting here and there and 1 month officially of us dating (we couldn’t go out before cuz he wanted to prioritize getting a job first).

Hes been really sweet and nice and ive noticed as we spend more time togather he seems to want to talk more/be more affectionate. However, he told me on our 4th date that hes still friends with his ex. He knows her from 
High school and they dated for 4 years. Her parents wanted to get her married so out of worry they told their parents they liked eachother for marriage however cuz this guy was still so young and didnt have a career was still in school, parents from both sides said no. He told me this relationship ended 3 years ago and now he will be starting his first job soon in a week or two so i asked him since he has a job now why doesn’t he date his ex or try again essentially? He said hes been asked this by his friends before and that theres 2 reason. He said first is he doesn’t want to go thru that again and the second is (he said this is the bigger reason) he just doesn’t want to. He said they started off as friends before dating and so he thinks its easier to go back to being friends. He also did mention that his ex got sick with a autoimmune disease which affected her and its been 9 years since she dated anyone other than him and that she’ll prob be getting married this year or next. However, i am not sure if he ever did no contact with this girl. He did have another long term relationship after that one for a year but i am not concerned about that cuz it seems like they were incompatible. After he was done talking asked me about my relationship history so i told him. I am pretty much over my ex (3yr relationship) he is blocked and i don’t plan to talk or see him again. Idk but hearing him tell me hes friends with his ex and paired with talking about my ex just made me soo anxious in his car. It was a heavy convo at the time and after we were done talking he asked if i wanted a hug and i said yes. From there we hugged and after a bit when i moved a little back he moved his mouth close to my face and instinctively we kissed. He said “damn” and “im lucky”. When i moved back he said wait i wanna try again or something and we kissed again. Then i told him i had to leave cuz it was getting late so he dropped me to my car started my car and kissed me goodbye. For a moment i thoughy he had my keys and was looking thru my bag to see if i could find them but then he came out of his car to help and i told him i found them and then he was okay “can i get a goodbye kiss” and we kissed goodbye.

Also before this ex talk happened we were walking around the mall and he bought me a plushie (he knows i like them) and we got fries and sat on a bench in the mall (they were his cuz i wasn’t hungry at the time), but as we were sitting and talking he moved my hair out of my face and put his arm around me on the chair and was feeding me the fries. After some time i told him i wasnt hungry and that id feed him so i fed him the fries for a while lol. After we got coffee and a pastry after and sat in his car to eat and talk. After some time had passed of us talking and we were done eating, he said “can i ask why did you swipe on me?” I said “i thought your were cute”. He was like “really? I think youre really beautiful and i thought and i still kinda think your out of my league”. Thats when i told him that wasnt true.

The next time we hung out we talked for a longgggg time in his car and were having fun being goofy and then we hugged and started making out. He asked me to lay on him cuz i said i was tired so i got on top of him legs to the sides around him in his lap and he seemed to go quiet for a bit and was like one second i have to adjust something. So i lifted myself a little and he fixed himself and then after a min he was like can you sit on your side (i feel like i unintentionally turned him on), so i sat in his lap with my legs on the side hanging into the passenger seat. lap. He gave me so many kisses, told me i was beautiful. He even grabbed my hand kissed it and said my fingers are so tender. And in that position we would kiss and i saw him move his hand on my outer thigh and a small grab on my ass. After a bit i got tired so i went back in the passenger seat and somehow the convo steered to him coming laying next to me and at first he was like idk how ill be able to but then he was like “oh maybe if i … blah”, i said yeah that could work. So with my legs straight laying on the passenger seat he cane on top of me to lay on me, keep in mind my legs were trapped under him and his legs. We start making out and he starts kissing my neck, i was grabbing harder on to him and breathing heavy maybe a few soft moans too. He then started putting his hand on my pussy and rubbing thru my jeans, i was softly moaning a bit and it was all turning me on so much that i pushed him back to open and spread my legs around him. We continued making out and i think he was getting turned on cuz we both had that dirty turned on look with sleepy eyes. I pushed him back and spread my legs around him. He was then playing with my boobs and pushed my shirt up and sucked them. And them kissed my stomach and kissed/ate me thru my thick ass jeans for a minute. Then he started unbuttoning my jeans but i stopped him cuz i wasn’t shaved. So he continued to kiss and rubbed my pussy and was thrusting himself into me (we were both clothed). I was also really turned on cuz he looks innocent but was dominant in this state. And from a moment he said “you actually like me?” And i just kissed him. We grabbed food after and he was being so sweet like he held my hand and put it in his pocket when we crossed the road. And crossing the road back he put his arm around me and helped me cross the road with him. Later that night we called and were on the phone for 5 hrs and he told me the best part of the day was looking at me, he said the other stuff too (sexy time) but best was looking at me.

Whenever i see him in person he always tells me how beautiful i am. He also hasnt started his job but he does seem to wanna see me alot. He likes my personality too cuz he told me he always has a fun time when hes with me and i think we have good conversations as well. He also remembers so many small details about me that ill forgot i even told him, even my bday (maybe cuz hes a really good listener but also said he has bad memory). Also last time we called he gave me a timeline of our dates so far and what we did and even remembered our chat history on hinge and how we started talking. He told me that he thought i was really pretty and ddint understand why a girl like me would match with him and that when we met i was just as beautiful as he imagined me to be.

I guess i really like him but something is holding me back from seeing something longterm with him. I think its the ex thing. I really dont wanna make him chose or even make him remove her out of his life but i dont want my partner to be in contact with their ex. There are still alot of questions to ask. Also as good as he is to me idk if i am a rebound or he is trying to fill some void.
Would really appreciate if someone can offer some solid advice.

1kwu1ac,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1kwu1ac/am_i_overreacting_or_did_this_visit_from_old/,Am I overreacting or did this visit from old friends leave me feeling judged and off?,"Hi Reddit,



Two old friends, **S and T**, visited me recently. We’ve known each other since school, and all of us grew up in a big city back home, but now live in different places. I hosted them in the big city where I currently live with my long-term partner.



S was visiting for the first time, and I genuinely wanted them to experience the city however they liked. T visits once a year for less than a week and expected a lot—asking for small things constantly, even wanting a home-cooked meal. I didn’t mind that, but even S found it a bit strange and suggested we just order in.



Before T arrived, S and I were on the same page about how T can be—entitled and sometimes draining. But after T joined us, it felt like that dynamic changed, and by the end, I was the only one noticing the friction.



There was a specific incident where T wanted to meet their own friend and invited them over. They claimed they had to walk 45 minutes because public transport wasn’t working—but it was. There was some construction, but buses and trains were still functional. What’s more, we later found out their friend actually preferred walking back because they felt safer that way. Yet somehow, the way T handled it made me feel responsible.



Throughout the weekend, T didn’t want to explore much, kept saying they were tired and wanted to go home early. On their last day, they made a heavy comment like “tomorrow’s going to be hard,” referring to how hard it is going back to a quiet city after being in a busy place around people. They also compared it to their cousin’s experience of feeling isolated after visiting home, and the way they said it felt like I couldn’t possibly understand because I live with someone.



That night, they doubled down, saying things like “you don’t know real loneliness,” and how I wouldn’t get it because I don’t live alone or work full-time in person. I tried to acknowledge and support what they were feeling, but anytime I responded, it felt like they shut it down. It was a one-way conversation and left me emotionally drained.



There were also small moments of judgment that added up. For example, when I offered S my perfume, they said “I have my own” in a tone that felt defensive. They were extremely particular about their looks, which is fine, but when I casually said I don’t follow people from school on Instagram because we don’t talk, both gave me a strange look—as if that personal choice was offensive.



After T left, I finally told S I was feeling off and a bit emotionally overwhelmed. At first they agreed that T had been a lot, but then softened and acted like it wasn’t such a big deal anymore. That shift confused me—because we had been so aligned before. It left me wondering if I was just being too sensitive.



To top it off, I had more coffee and hash/weed than I usually do, barely slept (I’m usually an 8-hour sleeper), and I was PMSing. All of which made my anxiety and emotional regulation worse, and I even woke up with jaw pain from clenching.



And when they left… I broke down. Hard. I felt like I’d ruined my friendship with S too, and the whole thing just made me miss home even more.



I don’t know if it was just burnout from the visit or if this trip made me realize some friendships don’t fit anymore. Either way, I feel hollow now.



⸻

TL;DR:

Two old friends visited me, and instead of feeling connected, I felt judged, emotionally shut down, and drained. One friend was subtly demanding, made intense remarks about loneliness, and shifted blame unnecessarily. Another friend, who was on the same page with me initially, seemed to flip by the end. Add coffee, weed, PMS, and lack of sleep—and I’m left feeling alienated and unsure if I’m overreacting or just seeing things clearly.",1,1748368682.0,AmIOverreacting,1,1.0,False
1kwtzyg,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwtzyg,LV CarryAll BB from God Factory (TS Ai Weiyuan) – Here’s My Honest Take💃❤,"**LV CarryAll BB (M13014) – My Honest Thoughts After Finally Pulling the Trigger**

So I finally did it. After obsessing over the CarryAll BB for what feels like forever, reading way too many Reddit reviews, and comparing every possible photo under the sun—I ordered mine from **Ai Weiyuan (God Factory)**, and wow. I didn’t expect to be this happy with it, but here we are.

Let me walk you through the experience because if you’re like me—overthinking every detail—you’ll appreciate knowing how it all went down.


**Choosing the Bag: Love at First Scroll**

I’d been eyeing this bag for months. I wanted something that could do it all—run errands, dress up a little, and still feel low-key. I didn’t want logos screaming at people across the street, but I still wanted something undeniably LV. The **CarryAll BB** hits that balance so perfectly. It’s stylish but not flashy. It’s compact but not tiny. Just… the sweet spot.


 **🛒 Ordering from Ai Weiyuan: Easy and Straightforward**

**Seller: Ai Weiyuan**

**WhatsApp: +44 7874 063073**

Payment: PayPal 

Honestly? Super smooth. I messaged Ai Weiyuan, got fast replies, and the QC pics came quickly. I asked some pretty picky questions about the leather color and canvas texture, and she answered everything patiently. I never felt rushed or ignored.

Shipping didn’t take too long either—I think it was just under two weeks. It arrived safely, double-boxed, with no smell, no damage, and no weird surprises. Just a clean, new bag waiting to be admired.


 **🤗First Impressions: Immediate Heart-Eyes**

When I opened the package, I just stood there staring at it for a solid minute. The **canvas is beautiful**—rich in color, not shiny or plasticky. The monogram is sharp and evenly spaced, Nothing looked off. The shape of the bag is structured but still soft. It doesn’t look stiff or boxy, which I was slightly nervous about.

The vachetta leather is chef’s kiss. The contrast with the canvas is so good.


 **🧐 Let’s Talk Details (Because That’s What Matters**

I checked everything—stitching, alignment, hardware, all of it. The stitching is tidy and consistent. No loose threads or funky spacing. The hardware is solid—not the cheap kind that rattles or feels too light. It’s got a nice weight, and the gold tone isn’t overly yellow.

The drawstring is functional but not annoying. It opens and closes smoothly and actually holds the shape of the bag nicely. Is that little LV tag hanging from the side? Love it. It is a small detail, but it adds to the whole vibe.


**🧳 Real-Life Use: Fits Way More Than It Looks**

I’ve been using this bag non-stop. Like, it hasn’t even gone back on the shelf. I’ve taken it out for coffee runs and casual dinners, even to work once. It fits everything I need: phone, wallet, keys, lip balm, compact, sunglasses, and even a mini notebook when I need it.

The strap is comfy on the shoulder and adjusts easily. I don’t usually wear my bags crossbody, but I tested it, and it sits pretty well. It just depends on your height and how you like it to fall.

**🔍 How It Compares to the Real One**

I’ve seen the auth version in-store, and unless you’re someone who works at Louis Vuitton, I really don’t think anyone would know the difference. Like, truly. The monogram size, the leather trim, the shape, the little tag details—it’s all there. I even pulled up side-by-side pics and couldn’t find anything that screamed “rep.”

And honestly? Even if someone did know—it doesn’t matter. I feel amazing carrying it. That’s what counts.

**💬 Final Thoughts: 10/10 Would Buy Again**

This bag genuinely makes me happy every time I carry it. It feels good**, looks amazing**, and it’s already become one of my favorites. TS Ai Weiyuan is such a nice seller to work with, she has absolutely amazing knowledge of these bags. The quality is top-tier, the experience was smooth, and the end result is this beautiful, wearable, everyday bag.

I’m so glad I stopped hesitating and just bought it. Zero regrets.

If anyone has questions, I'm happy to help out—because honestly, I stalked other people’s reviews for weeks before pulling the trigger. Hope this helps someone else make the jump 💛

1kwtwdv,https://i.redd.it/0ev581js4d3f1.png,Systems force complicity,"Congrats on being vegan. Seriously. Choosing not to eat animals in a blood-drenched world takes guts.
But let’s cut the bullshit; that’s not the end of the conversation.
Because animals are still suffering, screaming, dying... They're just not on your plate.

They’re in your medications, your beauty products, your fucking oat milk supply chains.
They’re crushed in monoculture farms. Displaced by your avocados. Poisoned by runoff from your soy.
Bees worked to death to keep up with your almonds.
Mice and birds ground up in combine harvesters so you can post “plant-based” under a filtered meal pic.

This isn’t a purity contest.
There’s no clean way to live inside a system built on extraction, death, and convenience.
You think you opted out? You didn’t.
You just picked a cleaner brand of complicity.

The truth is, you can’t buy your way to innocence.
You can’t shop your way to freedom, for you or the planet or the animals.
Because this system doesn’t give a shit what you eat.
As long as you’re still spending, still dividing, still blaming other poor people for not shopping at Whole Foods.

Real compassion isn’t about dietary labels. It’s about systemic rage.
It’s about fighting the corporations, the legislation, the endless fucking slaughterhouse of late capitalism.
It’s about looking at the whole tangled mess and saying:
This is not enough. This will never be enough. I want more than just feeling morally superior while the Earth burns and the animals bleed somewhere off-screen.

Want to avoid harming animals? Cool. Then unless you're doing all of this, you're still complicit:

1. Grow your own food - No mass agriculture. Even plant-based food industries displace and kill animals through deforestation, monoculture, pesticide use, and habitat destruction. If you didn’t grow it in your backyard, it probably cost a life.


2. Harvest your own water - Municipal systems disrupt aquatic ecosystems, poison wildlife with run-off, and kill thousands of animals via chemical treatment and filtration infrastructure. If you're using a tap, you're part of that.


3. Generate zero electricity - Solar, wind, hydro; all require mining that obliterates habitats and poisons creatures. Batteries? An ethical bloodbath. If you’re flipping a light switch, something bled for it.


4. Make your own clothes - Even cotton and synthetics slaughter animals: fields are drenched in pesticides, microplastics poison marine life. If you didn’t grow, spin, and sew your clothes without chemicals or machines, you're wearing suffering.


5. Never drive or fly - Roads kill. Highways displace migration routes. Every vehicle flattens wildlife. Fuel extraction destroys ecosystems. Unless you're barefoot and walking, you’re complicit.


6. No medicine - Virtually all drugs are tested on animals. Every prescription, every vaccine, even painkillers come with a body count. If you’ve ever taken a paracetamol, you’ve benefited from animal suffering.


7. No sugar, chocolate, coffee, or bananas - These destroy rainforests and kill untold thousands of insects, birds, reptiles, and mammals. Unless you're hand-growing tropical crops without harming a single creature (you’re not), you’re buying death wrapped in sweetness.


8. No modern tech - Every phone, computer, and smart gadget is soaked in environmental destruction, mining runoff, and animal habitat collapse. If you’re posting about ethics online, you’re doing it on the bones of animals.


9. No animal labor - No bees in hives, no hens in coops. No dogs bred to serve humans, no horses to pull carts. If you're anti-exploitation, it includes your ""happy"" backyard pets.


10. Accept zero healthcare - Hospitals rely on animal research, animal-based materials, and life-saving drugs tested on sentient beings. If you’ve ever lived because of a modern medical intervention, an animal paid for that.


You want to cause no harm? Then go dark. Live wild. Naked. Alone. Silent. Die young.

Or.... accept that we live in a fucked-up system where every step leaks blood, and maybe instead of purity, focus on compassion, impact, and honesty. Do better, yes. But don’t act like you’re above it. You're not. None of us are. ",1,1748368366.0,u_Breakaway_Collective,0,1.0,False

1kwtvrj,https://i.redd.it/cop54cdd4d3f1.png,Reclaiming My Crown:When His Betrayal Became My Liberation - I figured out how to read it—I unraveled the story to its last secret.,"Standing at the civil registration office, Thaddeus Blake's ""little sister"" sent him a pregnancy test photo. He didn't even hesitate—just left me standing there and rushed off to bring her home. Within hours, Selena posted intimate photos of them together. The background? Our bedroom. Then came Thaddeus's message ""I got drunk at that party, and Violet is pregnant.

 I need to take care of her."" ""She was gonna hide it from me and raise the kid alone, but she's so young and has this bright future ahead of her as a cardiac surgeon... I can't mess that up for her. And I can't just abandon an innocent baby."" ""You've been dying to have kids, right? Once she gives birth, I'll send her to Europe to finish her medical study. You can raise the child—it'll only know you as mom！"" When I didn't respond, he added, ""About our marriage registration... we have to postpone it after Violet delivers the baby."" I stared at my phone screen, laughing until my eyes turned red. Did he really think Selena Lockhart, the only heiress of the Lockhart family, had no options but him? I immediately called Archer Reynolds: ""Marriage—interested?"" ... He had been waiting at the airport for a business flight to Italy when my call dragged him to the registry office. 

Remembering his exasperated expression earlier, I felt a twinge of guilt. ""Selena,did I owe you something? I chased you for eight years without getting so much as an extra glance, and now you suddenly want to get married?"" I glanced at my watch, ""The Office closing soon. Are you in or not?"" He deflated instantly. ""OKAY! I brought certifications, rescheduled my flight, and even told my parents. Let's go!"" ... I suppose my continued silence finally prompted Thaddeus to call. His voice carried a hint of urgency. ""Selena,don't overthink this. You're the only one in my heart. With Violet, it's purely admiration. That night was truly just an accident!"" ""I understand,"" I replied, my voice unnervingly calm. ""That's what men do, right?"" Silence stretched across the line for several seconds before I heard him take a deep breath. ""Where are you? I'll send the driver to get you. Violet's uncomfortable, and I really can't leave her away..."" I cut him off""No need."" His voice suddenly turned cold, ""Selena,are you angry now? I've explained everything clearly. Violet will leave after the baby is born. 

What more do you want from me?"" I felt suffocated,unconsciously clutched my marriage certificate, struggling to keep my voice steady. ""Thaddeus, let's break up."" He paused, then let out a bitter laugh. ""After all these years, don't you know how I feel about you? Yes, I made a damn mistake, but what man doesn't? I'm already making up. Do you really so strict with this?"" I closed my lips,without any words. I stayed silent, his patience finally broke out. ""Fine!Whatever!Let's break up!You'll be back here crying within the half hour!"" The line went dead with a sharp click, leaving me nothing but the dial tone. I took a taxi and returned to what was once our home. 

Not for begging him, but simply to pack up my things before leaving. When I pushed the door open, Thaddeus stood there wearing an apron, the dining table laden with carefully prepared dishes. He and Violet sat facing each other, eating and laughing together. He gently served food on her plate, even tenderly feeding morsels directly to her lips. That gentle expression on his face—I had naively believed it only belongs to me. I remembered when I cooked for him, he would embrace me from behind, whispering in my ear""Thank you, baby."" It seemed nice, yet throughout our five years together, he had never once made me even a simple cup of coffee. He was the youngest cardiothoracic professor at the country's most prestigious medical school.

 His always told me ""My hands are for surgery,they must be protected at all time."" Even when holding my hand, he was excessively cautious. Yet now, here he was, breaking his own rule to cook for Violet. When Thaddeus spotted me,letting out a cold laugh and giving a knowing look that said, “I knew it.” Violet greeted me with manufactured enthusiasm: ""Selena!You're home! Would you like to join us for dinner?"" I silently walked past her, heading straight for the bedroom. ""Stop right there!"" Thaddeus jumped to his feet, his face darkening ominously. ""Violet is speaking to you. At least you could response her. Have you no basic manners at all?"" I turned slowly,curling into a cold smile. ""How exactly would you like me to respond? Should I thank her for eagerly carrying my fiancé's child, making me an instant mother without any pains? Or should I rush over and slap that homewrecker across the face, telling her to get the hell out of my house?!"" ""You—!"" Thaddeus sputtered, veins bulging at his temples. ""Ugh..."" Violet suddenly covered her mouth, retching as tears run out of her eyes. Thaddeus anxiously asked, ""Violet, what's wrong? Are you feeling bad?"" ""I'm fine, Thaddeus..."" 

She trembled as she clutched his sleeve, yet directed her tearful performance at me. ""Selena this is all my fault. I didn't want to stay in your home either, but I truly had nowhere else to go. I—I'll leave as soon as my baby is born, I promise I won't disturb you and Thaddeus anymore."" As she spoke, she suddenly clutched her stomach, sobbing, ""I'm so sorry, baby. Mommy doesn't want to abandon you, but Mommy did something terrible and must be punished. I'm so sorry..."" Then she began retching violently again, collapsing dramatically into Thaddeus's arms. Thaddeus looked at me with pure contempt, as if I had committed some unforgivable sin. ""Are you satisfied now?"" I scoffed and walked away without another word. Chapter 2 My attitude completely enraged Thaddeus.

He grabbed a glass from the table and violently threw it directly at me. A sharp pain exploded at the back of my head as the glass shattered. I collapsed heavily onto the stairs. The intense pain made me break into an instant cold sweat, leaving me temporarily unable to stand. ""Stop the act! Get up already!"" Thaddeus barked impatiently from behind me. Violet approached with fake concern: ""Selena,are you alright? I think the glass just grazed your shoulder..."" ""Shut up!"" I cut her off through gritted teeth, struggling to my feet. Seeing my harsh treatment of Violet, Thaddeus's eyes turned icy. ""Violet has no appetite. Go make her that chicken soup you're good at. Remember, no onions—she doesn't like them."" ""No,"" I refused without hesitation. ""That wasn't a request!"" Thaddeus's face darkened menacingly. ""Selena,do you really think you have a another choice here?"" 

I clenched my fists and looked him straight in the eyes. ""I said no. So what?"" A cold glint flashed in Thaddeus's eyes. He stormed forward, roughly grabbed my arm, and shoved me forcefully into the kitchen. ""Slam!"" The door banged shut behind me. ""You're not coming out until that soup is done!"" ""Thaddeus, you've lost your mind!"" I pounded on the door, screaming ""Let me out!"" until my voice was raw, but was met with nothing but silence. My palms were red, swollen and burning from hitting the door. Finally, I slid down exhausted to the floor, leaning against the cold door. Through the door, their conversation came through clearly. Violet spoke in a soft, gentle voice. ""Thaddeus, aren't you being too much to Selena? If she doesn't want to cook,I'm okay without drinking the soup."" Thaddeus sighed, ""Violet, she's been spoiled by her family all these years. I need to fix that PRINCESS attitude. If she's going to marry into the Blake family, she needs to obey our rules. Otherwise, how will she properly raise our heir?"" ""The Blakes have always valued kindness, but she's too stubborn... My mother has never really liked her."" Violet asked, confused, ""Thaddeus, why don't you just break up with her then?"" Suddenly, everything went quiet outside. I held my breath, perfectly still against the door. Well, if I was so terrible in his eyes, why put up with me at all? The silence stretched on until Violet carefully prompted, ""Thaddeus?"" His calm voice pierced my heart like a knife: ""The Lockhart family's influence is the best in LA. They've been incredibly helpful to my career over the years...""

 I clutched my chest tightly, unable to hold back my tears any longer. So that was it. All these years, what he valued was the Lockhart name, not me. In a daze, I remembered when my grandfather had a sudden heart attack. It was Thaddeus who boldly proposed the surgical procedure that saved his life. I fell for this brilliant young doctor with exceptional skills at the first sight. I had only sent a text express my gratitude, never expecting him to pursue me so relentlessly afterward. He never directly asked for my family's help. All those behind-the-scenes arrangements were made by me without his knowledge. How ridiculous!I had always worried he would refuse if he found out. The kitchen door opened. Thaddeus visibly startled when he saw me, then frowned ""All this crying over making soup? Get out of my sight. You're annoying!"" Fighting dizziness, I stood up and stumbled toward the bedroom. The moment I pushed open the door, a chill ran down my spine. The bedsheets had been changed to the pink lace style I despised. The photo of me on the nightstand had been replaced with a portrait of an unknown baby. In the closet, not a single piece of my clothing remained. 

Thaddeus's voice came from behind me, ""The guest room is too crowded. Violet needs the master bedroom now, especially with her pregnancy."" Violet added timidly， ""You don't mind, do you, Selena? Don't worry, once the baby is born, I'll—"" ""Fine!"" I cut her off. ""Where are my things?"" Thaddeus looked away, ""The housekeeper moved them to the storage room. The nearest guest room is being converted into a nursery. Choose any other guest room you want."" After a moment of silence, I nodded ""Okay."" In the storage room, my designer dresses were carelessly thrown on the floor, jewelry scattered in dirty corners, like unwanted trash. Chapter 3 I took a deep breath and looked mockingly at Violet as she followed me in, ""So eager, are you? Couldn't even wait for me to leave first?"" A flash of embarrassment crossed her face before she quickly replaced it with an innocent expression, ""What are you talking about, Selena? Thaddeus had the housekeeper put these away. I didn't do anything."" I laughed coldly, pointing to the footprint on my dress, ""Was this the their work too?"" ""So what if it was me?"" She suddenly lowered her voice, a vicious gleam in her eyes, while pretending to back away in fear. ""Please, just let me go, Selena."" With that, she suddenly cried out and pretended to fall backward. Thaddeus rushed in just in time to catch her. Violet immediately clutched her stomach and began sobbing, ""Thaddeus, I didn't do anything, but Selena pushed me...

Thank goodness you came, or the baby might have..."" ""I didn't push her!"" My throat tightened as I instinctively tried to explain. A violent glint flared in his eyes as he lunged forward, grabbing my throat and slamming me against the wall. ""You think I'd believe you? You think Violet would use our baby to frame you? When did you become so vicious!"" His grip was terrifyingly strong.

 I could barely breathe as I struggled to squeeze out a few words. ""I really... didn't..."" ""Enough! I don't want to hear your excuses!"" He laughed bitterly, throwing me heavily to the floor. ""Go back to Lockhart Family to be the princess! Don't come back until you realize your mistakes!"" I stumbled to my feet, staring at him in disbelief. At eleven at night, he was throwing me out? I remembered how, in the past, he would insist on accompanying me even for a late-night walk. Now, he stood with his chin raised, not even willing to spare me a glance. How many times had he mad at me today because of Violet? No matter what I say or do, it’s always wrong in his eyes.

 And today was supposed to be the day we got our marriage license. I closed my eyes, then left without even taking my clothes, fleeing that suffocating place without looking back. ... As soon as I returned to Lockhart Estate, My phone rang. It was a video from Violet. I knew I shouldn't open it, but my finger pressed play uncontrolled. In the video, Thaddeus was tenderly embracing Violet, his eyes closed as he gently kissed her forehead, his face full of contentment and affection. His voice carried a touch of regret, ""Violet, if I had met you earlier, I would never have been with Selena. You're so talented in medicine, so pure and ambitious. What about her? He relied on Lockhart’s name to get away with everything,loafs around all day."" 



""The Blake family has been doctors for generations. If I had really married her, she would have ruined our reputation sooner or later!"" Every word was like a poisoned needle, precisely stabbing my most vulnerable spots. Violet had easily become his personal student thanks to her family's connections, and he called her his ""little sister"". 

That was what he called ""talented."" Meanwhile, I had given up my family resources, starting from the bottom and working my way up to become investment director at Lockhart Enterprises. In his eyes, that was ""loafs around all day."" So in his heart, I was never worth anything. How could he ever have truly loved me? I put down my phone, tears soaking my pillow. 

The sky was just beginning to lighten,Archer's call came through. ""My dear,sleep well?"" His voice couldn't hide his excitement. ""I just landed in Milan. I was so excited I couldn't sleep during the entire flight. I still can't believe you actually married me."" His tone suddenly softened, ""Wife, I already miss you. How about you?"" Wife? That word snapped me back to reality. That's right—yesterday, in my anger, I had gotten my marriage certificate with Archer. ""Wife? Why aren't you saying anything? Are you... having regrets?"" His voice full of wronged. ""No,"" I answered softly.

 Archer and I had grown up together. Though I wasn't sure if he truly loved me, at least I knew him well. The Reynolds family was a suitable match for mine—equals in status and wealth. There was an audible sigh of relief on the other end of the phone, his energy immediately returning, ""I'm coming back tomorrow! We'll pick out wedding rings! The certificate is legal, but we couldn't skip the proposal or the wedding ceremony as well!"" ""Just focus on being the most beautiful bride. 

Leave everything else to me."" I couldn't help but smile, agreeing to his plans. That was Archer. With him, everything would be taken care of. All I had to do was follow along. As for Thaddeus... In my memories, it was always his hurried back walking away. Even getting the marriage certificate was my initiative. Back then, he had frowned and said""It's only five years. Isn't it a bit be earlier?"" The difference between being loved and not was so clear. ",1,1748368324.0,Contemporary_Romance,1,1.0,False

Olivia's POV

 

""Wake up, Olivia,"" Mom's voice echoed in my sleep.

 

I groaned, pulling the blanket over my head. ""Five more minutes, Mom.""

 

""We don't have any more minutes,"" she snapped, shaking my leg with a force that made it impossible to ignore. ""Get up now, or we'll be late.""

 

""Mom,"" I groaned in frustration, slowly forcing my eyes open.

 

""Don't tell me you still want to sleep,"" she said, standing at the foot of my bed, her hands placed firmly on her hips as she tapped her foot impatiently on the tiled floor. ""Other servants are already up doing their duties, but you are still sleeping? Do you want us relieved of our duties?"" Mother snapped angrily at me.

 

I sighed heavily, tossing the blanket aside as I dragged myself out of bed. ""I'm up, I'm up,"" I muttered, rubbing the sleep from my eyes.

 

""Anita is staying in the pack house for the weekend, and she has asked that you be the one to attend to her until she leaves,"" Mother announced, and my frown deepened. ""Why me? Out of all the servants, why do I have to be her personal maid?""

 

""Don't start,"" Mom said firmly, shoving me toward the bathroom. ""Get moving. There's no time for complaining.""

 

I stomped to the bathroom, muttering under my breath as I turned on the tap.

 

The thought of spending the day attending to Anita made my stomach churn.

 

Anita and I were born on the same day, which was why we were close in the first place. Once, she had been my best friend. We'd grown up together, running through the forest, sharing secrets, and dreaming of our future.

 

That was before everything fell apart.

 

My father was one of the pack's strongest warriors, and my mother worked in the pack hospital. Our family may not have been the wealthiest, but we had respect.

 

But everything changed the night of the setup.

 

I stared into the mirror as the memories replayed in my head. My father had been framed for stealing from the Alpha, a crime punishable by death. Despite his pleas of innocence, no one believed him. The evidence gotten was all pointed at him, planted carefully by someone who wanted to see him fall. We were stripped of everything. My father was imprisoned for life, my mother was demoted to an omega, and I was forced to share her fate.

 *1*

Anita was there that night. She hadn't comforted me, hadn't spoken up for the family she once called her own. Instead, she stayed silent, her gaze avoiding mine as we were being mocked.

 

Now, years later, our former Beta had died from an incurable illness, and her father was appointed the new Beta. Anita was now the Beta's daughter. And I? I was nothing more than a servant. An omega.

 *1*

What made it worse was how effortlessly she fit into her new role. The triplets, our Alpha's sons, Louis, Levi, and Lennox, loved her. Their attention, their admiration, it all belonged to her now. They literally worshiped the ground she walked on, and everyone believed she would turn out to be their mate once she turned eighteen, which was only a few days away. The brothers were actually competing among themselves for her attention and love, and it was so annoying to watch. Or perhaps I was just jealous of her life.

 

I finished washing up, dressed quickly into the maid's uniform, and stepped into the kitchen, where my mother was preparing breakfast.

 

""Olivia,"" my mother called, ""I know this isn't easy, but… we've already lost so much. Don't give them a reason to take more.""

 

I nodded, biting back the urge to argue. She didn't understand. How could she? I was once the daughter of a respected Gamma, but now? I was a mere Omega.

 

""Here,"" my mother said, handing me a tray with a steaming cup of coffee. ""She asked for this.""

 

I frowned but took the tray and headed toward the guest room where she was staying.

 

""I'll find my mate, and all this will be over,"" I whispered, trying to comfort myself.

 

But I let out a dry laugh. Yeah, right. The only mate I would get was another omega, another nobody just like me. This life? It wasn't ending.

 

Reaching Anita's room, I sighed heavily and knocked on her door, bracing myself for another day of being reminded of how far I'd fallen, and how far she'd risen.

 

I sucked a deep breath before knocking again.

 

""Come in,"" Anita's voice called.

 

I pushed the door open carefully, keeping my head down. ""Your coffee,"" I said quietly, stepping inside the room.

 

The first thing I noticed was the sound. A soft giggle, followed by the low murmur of a man's voice. My eyes moved up for just a second, and what I saw stopped me in my tracks.

 

There they were, Anita and Louis. She was tangled in his arms on the bed, her silky robe slipping off one shoulder. His shirt was open, his muscular chest on full display as he leaned into her, his lips brushing her neck.

 

I swallowed hard. My eyes darted back to the floor, and I placed the coffee on the table. Without another word, I turned, desperate to leave.

 

""Wait,"" Anita said sharply.

 

I froze, turning back to her reluctantly.

 

She kissed Louis deeply and even moaned in between the kisses before pulling away.

 *2*

My wolf growled in spite, but I put on a blank expression. Anita stepped out of the bed in just in her matching set of red underwear. I watched her sway her hips seductively at Louis, and I noticed how he hungrily gawked at her. Anita has a sexy body, and I have to give her credit for that.

 *2*

She picked up the cup of coffee, her lips curling into a smug smile as she swirled the liquid inside. Her eyes scanned me from head to toe. Louis remained silent on the bed, leaning back against the headboard.

 

She took a slow sip, her nose wrinkling in exaggerated displeasure. ""What is this?"" she asked, her voice sharp and filled with annoyance.

 

""It's the coffee you requested,"" I replied respectfully, keeping my tone polite despite the way my wolf growled in the back of my mind.

 

""This?"" she scoffed, holding the cup out as if it were something filthy. ""You call this coffee?""

 

My jaw clenched, but I forced myself to remain calm. ""It was made in the way you like it,"" I said.

 

Anita's eyes narrowed in anger, and suddenly, she threw the hot coffee over my chest and arms, soaking through my dress. The sharp sting of the heat made me gasp, but I bit my lip to keep from crying out.

 *2*

""Next time you serve me garbage like this, I swear I'll dump it on your face.""

 

Behind her, Louis remained silent, not wanting to interfere.

 

I stood frozen, my frown deepening as the coffee dripped down my skin. My wolf stirred, angry. I could almost hear her urging me to act. But what could I do?

 

""I'm sorry if the coffee wasn't to your liking,"" I said quietly, forcing the words out despite the lump in my throat. ""I'll remake it.""

 

Anita laughed, a light, annoying sound that grated on my nerves. ""Don't bother,"" she said, waving a dismissive hand. ""Just try to be less useless next time.""

 *1*

Turning her back to me, She turned away, moving toward Louis. She slid onto his lap like I wasn't even in the room. He pulled her close, barely sparing me a glance before his lips found her neck.

 

""You're dismissed,"" he said, though his voice lacked the sharpness it usually carried.

 

I swallowed hard, nodded, and turned to leave, my heart racing in my chest.

 

As I stepped out of the room, I let out a shaky breath. The humiliation burned as much as the coffee had, but I sucked in a deep breath and gathered my emotions.

 

Making my way back to the kitchen, I met with Bala, Lennox's personal guard. ""There you are. Lennox calls for you,""

 

I frowned. ""Did he say why?"" I asked, my stomach tightening. Lennox, the eldest of the triplets, rarely summoned me unless it was important. And rarely for anything good.

 

Bala shrugged. ""Not exactly, but he seemed really furious.""

 

A lump formed in my throat, but I forced myself to stay composed. Without another word, I turned and made my way to Lennox's room.

 

When I reached his door, I hesitated for a moment before knocking. Instantly, His authoritative voice ordered me in.

# Chapter 2: Accused

 

# 

Olivia's POV

 

Pushing the door open, I met a furious-looking Lennox waiting for me. His room was a mess. Clothes littered the floor, shoes thrown to each corner of the room. I was confused to see it in such a state because Lennox is a top-notch man when it comes to cleanliness; he loves everything tidy.

 

The moment he noticed my presence, he turned to me, and our eyes met. I could see anger and hatred for me in his eyes, and this baffled me because, among the triplets, Lennox was the closest to me when we were little. Back then, when my father was still a respectable warrior, he would bring me to the pack house to watch him train, and on various occasions, my path crossed with the triplets. I was just seven years old then, and they were twelve years old, but we turned out to be great friends. In fact, I visited the pack house more often, and while my father trained other warriors, I played with the triplets.

 

But that was before.

 

Before everything fell apart.

 

Just like Anita, they severed all ties, acting as though we had never been friends.

 

""Who cleaned my room yesterday?"" Lennox suddenly asked, his voice filled with rage that made my wolf whimper in fear inside me.

 

I swallowed hard in fear and forced myself to speak. ""I did.""

 

Lennox's expression darkened, and he took another step towards me, but out of fear, I instinctively took a step backward.

 

""Then tell me, Omega,"" he sneered, his voice dripping with anger, ""where is the diamond necklace I kept in my top drawer?""

 

I froze, my heart racing as Lennox's words sank in. A diamond necklace? I had no idea what he was talking about. My mind reeled, trying to recall if I had seen anything of the sort while cleaning his room. But all I could remember was organizing his scattered belongings, folding his clothes, and dusting the surfaces. There had been no necklace in the drawer.

 

""I… I didn't see any necklace,"" I stammered, my voice trembling as I met his accusing gaze.

 

Lennox's eyes narrowed. ""Don't lie to me, Omega,"" he growled, his tone laced with anger. ""The necklace didn't just grow legs and walk out of the drawer.""

 

""I'm not lying!"" I protested, panic creeping into my voice. ""I cleaned the room, but I didn't take anything. I swear!""

 

He closed the distance between us instantly, towering over me with his imposing frame. ""You expect me to believe that?"" he snapped. ""You and your kind are all the same. Thieves and liars.""

 *2*

His words hurt me, and I felt my wolf stir with anger, but I quickly suppressed her. Defending myself against Lennox in this state would only escalate things.

 

""I didn't take it,"" I repeated, my voice steadier this time. ""You can search me if you don't believe me. Check my room. Check anywhere you want. I have nothing to hide.""

 

Lennox studied me, his jaw clenched tight. For a moment, I thought he might strike me, but instead, he turned and began tearing through the room, pulling open drawers, throwing clothes onto the floor, and overturning furniture searching for the necklace.

 

I stood there, my lips pressed together as I fought to hold back my tears. The Lennox I had known as a child, the boy who had taught me to climb trees, The boy who used to teach me how to swim, who used to protect me from his brothers' pranks, was gone. In his place was a cold, bitter man who saw me as nothing more than a thief and a liar.

I’ll start. For the longest time I only played one character, my young arachnid Jenna Solis. She started out as a wide eyed medical intern just getting to grips with life on the space station, but by now she’s an avid lover of basically every department with enough knowledge to at least not embarrass herself as any head of staff. Jenna’s main drive is knowledge. She constantly seeks to learn or teach whatever she can. She gets really excited to see new crew members and show them the ropes because she vividly remembers her days as an intern and the people who helped her grow. 

Then you have my newest character, Bites-the-Dust. She’s a silly, rambunctious, energetic lizard girl who likes chocolate and coffee too much for her own good (which is, to say, at all).

I don’t know why, but when I play Bites she seems to be utterly incapable of taking things seriously, even when her job demands it. While she does her job well, she finds every opportunity she can to lighten the mood and make a joke out of it, though ideally not at anyone’s expense but her own. Even in command roles, she’s a goofball who cares less about efficiency than with making sure everyone around her is having a good time and a good laugh.

Anywho, those are my characters. Now tell me about yours!",6,1748368077.0,ss14,0,1.0,False

Like you, I (29F) was terrified of taking metronidazole (Flagyl).  I thought it would be unbearable—it wasn't. It was actually more tolerable than the illness itself, and my illness symptoms were mild to begin with (with a zofran here and there, I never threw up). I am also emetophobic, meaning I have an exaggerated aversion to n* and v*. Let me tell you when I took that triple treatment IT CHANGED MY LIFE. By the third day I was dancing around the house and my husband said I had a glow to my demeanor. The hunch in my neck also started straightening out. I'm on day 11 of 14-day triple treatment:
Flagyl (500 mg 3x/day) 
Doxycycline (100 mg 2x/day)
Pepto Bismol (525 mg 4x/day). 
I had to take doxy due to several antibiotic allergies. 

I read you shouldn't mix Zofran with antibiotics, so be aware. I never mixed them, but my need for Zofran also greatly decreased 2-3 days into treatment. 

One thing about metronidazole (Flagyl) side effects. Yes, they are awful. I never threw up because I did a natural treatment before triple, which only reduced my bloat a little bit and helped my BMI stay above 16. But I would not wait longer than 1-2 months of a natural remedy before starting antibiotics, especially if you've already been living a healthy lifestyle (I was not). I waited 6 months and was pointlessly torturing myself.

I googled what is an ideal antibiotic schedule AND THE AI SUMMARY SAID TO TAKE THEM AT 7 AM, 2 PM, AND 9 PM. Girl when I tell you I was taking them 4 hours apart in the morning, 10 am and then 2 pm, because I was sleeping in from exhaustion. **TAKE FLAGYL AT LEAST 6 HOURS APART.** This changed my life and made the treatment bearable. Just wake up and take the first dose on time to start your day right. Find out what times work for you, but whatever you do, don't take them too close together. 

I will say, I feel like most people's intolerance of quadruple treatment is due to the use of a proton pump inhibitor (acid reducer) like Omeprazole or Pantoprazole. I tried it without antibiotics first to see what it would do, and it made me really dizzy and unable to digest my food. Like, the dizziness from Flagyl is NOTHING compared to the dizziness from PPI's. Long term use can also increase your risk of dementia. I use digestive enzymes now and I imagine you'd DEFINITELY need to take digestive enzymes with a PPI to be able to eat. In lieu of the PPI, I cut out alcohol (obviously) coffee, tomatoes, vinegar and acidic fruits during and plan to continue until 3 months post-treatment. 

Top symptoms:
Constipation, Weight loss ~20 pounds

Symptoms I later realized I'd been having:
Vitamin deficiencies, cystic acne, belching, nausea, acid reflux, heart palpitations, self-harm thoughts, anxiety. These all immediately stopped on day 2 of treatment. 

I tested positive in December 2024 but can recall mild symptoms going as far back as early 2023.

For context, I'm a pretty healthy person who goes running and lifts weights 4-5x/week. However, in 2020 I started chewing 6 mg nicotine gum and I would also swallow the juices because I liked how it made my tummy burn 🙄. I kind of intermittently chewed it for four years. Additionally, in the months leading up to my fun little trip to the urgent care, I drank a bit more than normal, stopped running, and was basically on a diet of monsters, hot cheetos and prosciutto until 5 pm. Learn from me and don't abuse your stomach. 



TLDR: Take Flagyl at least 6 hours apart. Emetophobe who is eternally grateful to modern medicine (antibiotics) and I'll let you know what my test results are in 3 weeks!",3,1748367743.0,HPylori,0,1.0,False

I became a Christian in January of 2024. One of those “God presented Himself to me during rock bottom” moments. 

Everything obviously got worse since then, I had to walk away from everyone I knew previously, lived in my car for over almost a year, etc. 

I now live in an apartment that is beyond perfect. God really rewarded me after a year of crying and praying. It’s in a walkable SAFE neighborhood, there’s a cat cafe, herbal store, grocery store, local coffee shop, plant nursery, church and butcher shop all within half a mile of my apartment. My unit is spacious for me, plenty of window space, my landlord is an older Christian man and I have a kind neighbor my age who’s also Christian and seems to have taken a friendly interest in me. This is everything I could’ve asked for. My new job is barely a 15 min commute down one road. My boss appreciates me and I feel safe near her. 

The only thing is that during that first year, I decided to forgive and accept my parents back into my life. 

My mom is not doing well and I worry deeply for my 15 year old brother. I’m just now becoming financially stable, I’m catching up on rent and will be able to pay for my car insurance in June. I’m JUST NOW GETTING OUT OF SURVIVAL MODE. I am just now getting to the point where I can buy myself clothes that fit, have my bills taken care of and purchase things that remind me of who I was before the major depressive disorder took over. 

But I can’t stomach the thought of abandoning my brother. I’m not financially able to move right now and it wouldn’t be a smart idea. 

To make it all the more confusing, months ago I prayed to God to see an Arizona license plate (incredibly rare in the state I moved to) if I should move back to there. No, that’s not where my mom is. Within a week I saw two plates after a year of not seeing one in the state I live in. 

I’m beyond stressed and confused. Any insight? ",2,1748367686.0,TrueChristian,2,1.0,False

1kwtesi,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1kwtesi/i_found_a_weird_image_file_on_an_old_laptop/,I found a weird image file on an old laptop,"Hello Reddit.

I don’t usually post here, but something’s been happening that I can’t explain, and it’s starting to affect my sleep, my focus—everything. I’m not even sure what I want from posting this. Maybe just confirmation that I’m not the only one who's experienced something like this.

I’m from Bulacan, here in the Philippines. Pretty normal life, nothing out of the ordinary. Last week, I was digging through an old laptop—one I hadn’t used since early this year. It was given to me by a family friend, and I was planning to clean it out and give it to a cousin, so I was copying files off it when I saw something strange in the Downloads folder.

There was a JPEG file with a long, random name: [att.hStL\_jBh0oPIIlpmZXAUFHmca33bpFuPJ21SmJV-UsA.jpeg](https://imgur.com/a/rfDkGPi)

I thought it was just leftover junk from a messaging app or a corrupted file, but when I checked the timestamp, it said it was created or downloaded on May 24th. That’s what stood out—I hadn’t touched the laptop at all that month. It had been powered off, stored away in a drawer.

I opened the image.

It’s hard to explain what I saw. The photo was low-resolution, dark, and off-putting. It showed a face—lit from underneath like with a flashlight in a dark room. The lighting made the features look strange. Not distorted, but wrong somehow. The eyes were in shadow, the mouth stretched into a neutral expression that looked like it could turn into a smile or something else entirely. The background was pitch black.

I only looked at it for a few seconds before closing it. It gave me a weird feeling—not quite fear, just this overwhelming discomfort. The kind of feeling you get when someone stands too close behind you.

That night I had a dream. The face was there. Same lighting, same black background. It wasn’t doing anything, just looking. I woke up feeling off, but I brushed it off as just a reaction to the image.

The second night, it happened again. Same dream. Same face. Only this time, it felt like it was closer. I know that sounds vague, but I felt it. Just slightly nearer. I don’t remember much else, just the heaviness of it.

I deleted the file the next day. I even reinstalled Windows on the laptop, fully wiped everything. I didn’t want to take chances. But that didn’t stop the dreams.

And now I’ve started seeing the face when I’m awake.

At first, I thought it was just my mind playing tricks on me. Quick flashes in windows, reflections on my phone screen, the glare off my monitor. Always quick, always gone the moment I look straight at it. But I’ve seen it enough now that I know I’m not imagining it.

Out of frustration, I showed the image (before I deleted it) to a couple of friends—one in a group chat, the other in person. Neither of them could say where they’d seen it, but both had the same reaction: this weird pause, like they were trying to place it. Both stated that they have seen it before and then brushed it off like it was nothing. That actually unsettled me more than the dreams.

I haven’t turned the laptop back on since. I don’t even want to look at it. But honestly, I’m starting to think it doesn’t matter anymore. The image is stuck in my head. It just flashes sometimes, like a memory I didn’t ask for. I’ll be making coffee, watching a video, walking to the sari-sari store, and suddenly there it is—in my mind’s eye, clear as day. That face.

Another thing that’s been on my mind recently—there have been several cases of missing children in my village over the past few months. I don’t know if it’s related to what I’m experiencing, but it feels too coincidental. The cases haven’t been widely discussed, and it’s left a lot of people on edge, myself included.

I’m not saying there’s a connection between the image and the disappearances, but after everything that’s been happening to me, I can’t shake the feeling that something strange is going on. I know it sounds far-fetched, but has anyone experienced something like this alongside a situation like that? The way the face just lingers, and the way the whole thing feels so... wrong, it’s making me think there might be more to it than just a weird dream or image.

I’m not saying this is something supernatural. I really don’t know what to call it. Maybe there’s a logical explanation. Maybe it’s some kind of viral image or art project I forgot I saw. But it’s the way it feels—familiar in a way that makes my skin crawl. And I don’t understand how a simple image could have this kind of effect.

So I’m asking here, because I don’t know where else to turn.

Has anyone seen an image like this before? A face lit from below, in total darkness—expressionless, grainy, unsettling? Not a jumpscare, just something that lingers in your head?

Vegemite is certainly an acquired taste. It’s intensely savory if not bitter. Felt kind of like trying coffee or beer for the first time, I can’t say it tastes great but maybe it grows on you.

Military service represents one of the highest forms of loyalty: a commitment to protect others, even at great personal cost. The courage and sacrifice of those who served and gave their lives is a powerful reminder of what loyalty looks like at its most profound level.

Memorial Day is more than a day off, it’s a chance to reflect on the cost of freedom and the strength of our communities. By recognizing loyalty in all its forms, from the battlefield to the neighborhood coffee shop — we help build a culture of gratitude that lasts longer than just one weekend.

1kwtd42,https://www.reddit.com/r/kitchenremodel/comments/1kwtd42/cabinet_samples_impressions_if_it_helps_someone/,Cabinet Samples & Impressions - If it helps someone,"In the process of deciding on kitchen cabinets, I ordered samples from a number of companies and also ran some ""tests"" on them for durability.

Because if they are going to be in my kitchen, things are going to happen because we cook.

So in case this is helpful to anyone here going through the same, maybe this will save you some time and aggravation. If you had a better experience with any of the cabinets that we ultimately did not choose, do share!

**Who we tried samples from:** Barker Modern, Ikea, Designers Choice, RTAStore, RTACabinetStore, LilyAnn Cabinets, Richelieu/Tafisa.

Most samples were laminate, a few were painted, and a couple were glossy or matte acrylic.

The styles were either shaker (which I didn't want because I hate cleaning the grooves but was most readily available) or flat slab (because easier to clean).

**What I did to test them:** I smeared tomato paste and wet coffee grounds on them overnight; smacked them with pots, scratched them with my ring.

**Barker Modern**

**What we ordered:** Sample box and laminate door  
**Pros:** Looked great online, solid, heavy duty ply boxes.  
**Cons:** Did not like the banding on the laminate;  poorly constructed hinges and hinge installation, seemed expensive for the door quality

**LilyAnn**

**What we ordered:** White Shaker partial door sample  
**Pros:** Color was okay; somewhat local to us  
**Cons:** The shaker insert was the thinnest of all of the sample doors and didn't feel as study as the others

**RTAStore**

**What we ordered:** White painted shaker, gloss acrylic  
**Pros:** Wood door seemed fairly solid  
**Cons:** Gloss acrylic chipped with the first tap with a pot and had lots of fingerprint marks quickly (not surprising); wood dented as expected; no staining from tests

**RTACabinetStore**

**What we ordered:** White painted shaker, blue painted shaker, gloss acrylic, super gloss acrylic  
**Pros:** Wood door seemed fairly solid; white was a bit brighter than that from the RTAStore. Blue was quite nice and hid dents well.  
**Cons:** Gloss acrylic chipped with the first tap with a pot and had lots of fingerprint marks quickly (not surprising); super gloss was even worse. Wood dented as expected; no staining from tests

**IKEA**

**What we ordered:** viewed samples in store  
**Pros:** Boxes are versatile and you can get various non-Ikea fronts; cost effective; Blum hardware  
**Cons:** Ikea doors - did not like the quality of the laminate or banding; a client installed them two months ago and said that he hopes to get 5 years out of them. That was not reassuring.

**Designer's Choice**

**What we ordered:** borrowed laminate sample from store; Urban Collection IDA-01.  
**Pros:** Can have delivered flat pack or assembled; laminate seemed to be a bit thicker and better finished than the Barker Modern doors, particularly with the edge banding  
**Cons:** Pricier than painted models from RTA/RTAStore & LilyAnn

**Richelieu/Tafisa**

**What we ordered:** Sample of the Tafisa door front  
**Pros:** Took the most abuse with the least amount of damage from my tests. It took scraping a car key along the finish to create damage. Boxes are all ply, solidly constructed by our local kitchen company with the Tafisa fronts. Competitive price.

I was reading the story of yet another groomer in one of the Kingdom Halls, and I noticed he was happily married with two children. I asked why would a woman marry a man who was disfellowshipped and actually confessed to CSA?? But then I remembered how much ~soft~ power women have in this organization.

We shit on the men a lot in this religion (as we should), but just in my experiences as a “young single sister”, the “older” sisters and wives of elders were the ones who really helped make this organization what it is and would make my life hell. The elders really had no idea what was going on a lot of the time, and it’d be their wives or kids who would fill them in. 

Women are significant gatekeepers within the microcosm that we call the “local congregation” they are the information collectors, if a sister doesn’t like you she has the ability to make your social life nothing, they tamp down on your doubts with a smile and a scripture, they will take you for coffee or dinner where you will find yourself admitting your faults to them before they shuffle you the elders. They know everyone’s business, even the shit they probably shouldn’t know. They hold 90 percent of the Bible’s studies. They are the primary teachers in a congregation. Even when I would get in “trouble”, the elders would assign sisters, to study with me.

No sisters = no organization 

And it’s not that men “can’t” do it on their own, they just wouldn’t, cause most elders are incompetent emotionally and intellectually. 

We used to call a few sisters “Elderette” or “Sister Elder” or “Elder Jr” 

Surely that kind of contained soft power must be remarkable. 

Did that keep you in longer than it should’ve? Do you ever regret your soft tyranny?

A bit about me: I’m a 33 year old female. No history of stomach issues. I don’t drink coffee, tea or alcohol. I don’t eat meat or very much spicy food. I don’t smoke. I’m a little bit overweight but fit for my size. I’ve never had any digestive issues before (I can count the times on one hand I’ve ever vomited or had heartburn and I only usually get an upset stomach before menstruation). However I have a family history of stomach issues: my mother had GERD and several stomach issues, and my grandmother had diverticulitis. Both eventually had a stoma fitted in their 60s due to issues. 

My symptoms started a month ago. It began with a dull ache in my upper abdomen (right hypochondriac area). It was agony at night and would progress to a stabbing pain at times. Very tender to the touch. It was so bad I went to the emergency room. I was told it was likely my gallbladder. I got an ultrasound… no issue with my gallbladder, so I was discharged. I was told my liver and pancreas looked normal as well, but that I had some gas/inflammation in my stomach lining. 

Went back to my Dr, I was told it might be gastritis. I was treated with antibiotics (co amoxiclav) and a 2x daily PPI while I waited for an H Pylori test. This test was negative. I took the PPIs and experienced some symptom relief of the pain. I’m now off PPIs but I took another one this morning as the pain was back, and now when the pain comes, it spreads to the middle and left upper abdomen too. I get bad pains in my legs when I’m off the PPIs, I can’t sleep, I feel so dehydrated and have a really dry mouth. 

I think I had COVID around 8 weeks before symptom onset (I’ve had issues with post viral symptoms from COVID before, but never like this), and I had an awful period of stress in the 6 weeks leading up to the onset of symptoms as my step-son was in the ICU. I imagine these may be factors. 

Is this similar to the symptoms others have experienced? I have no idea why gastritis would suddenly come on for me, but it feels life ruining and debilitating and I just want it to stop.

1kwsxx0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Christianity/comments/1kwsxx0/how_to_cast_a_fireball/,How to cast a Fireball,"# Chapter 1: Introduction

I've recently started a deep dive into how our universe actually works. So far, I've concluded that **God exists**, and there are two distinct, primordial forces: **Chaos and Order**. They were once unified and beyond categorization. However, through God's influence, the universe, with all its diversity, began to move, creating life as we know and experience it.

To explain how I arrived at these two main force categories, I first examined the nature of physics laws and their concepts. Many theories remain unproven yet logically compelling. However, my mind can't fully grasp the immense details and formulas needed to explain every physical law. So, I simplified them, reducing them to what I believe is their most basic, primordial origin.

**Chaos and Order** are two concepts constantly intermingling within the universe. Chaos is the undeniable **driving force of change**, while Order is the **impermeable force of permanence**. From these, countless other concepts and laws branch out, always interacting, always opposing, yet never truly separable.

A perfect example of this idea is the **circle**.

Imagine an infinite number of entities within a circle trying to escape. Let's call this **Chaos**, and in essence, think of it as the circle's content. Now, **Order** tries to hold all these entities inside, striving to prevent their escape. This represents order, and what better way to illustrate it than as the circle's circumference?

If you recall, what's the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter? It's **pi (π)**. Pi is the numerical representation of Chaos trying to escape Order. This is just an analogy, not a literal explanation of the universe. But, to keep things simple, imagine the universe as a circle. We are merely by-products of these controlling and uncontrollable forces, bound by **God's law (pi)**. No matter the size of the circle, pi remains constant; it's transcendental.

Returning to the main topic of casting a fireball, this falls into the realm of **magic**. My aim is to find ways to explain and control the universe's nature: the fabric of time and space, the elements, the forces, and unseen concepts. Am I trying to become a wizard, a sage, or a magician?

Casting a fireball seems impossible, firmly within science fiction. And yes, it's fantasy. To even begin understanding how it might work, I chose to first solve the enigma of the circle and pi. I believe this is the foundational step.

Let's say understanding pi is like understanding the laws made by God. But as humans, we lack the capacity to fully comprehend God. So, to even approach God, we must first understand our human limitations and why we can't fully grasp His ways.

There are countless quests for immortality and godhood throughout history. However, none are recorded as majestically as those in religious texts. Jesus Christ is a descendant of God, Buddha achieved enlightenment and ascended to godhood. What about Zeus, Thor, Hercules? Are they myths? Legends? There are so many examples. I am Christian and believe in the Holy Trinity: God, His Son, and the Holy Spirit. I am also open to studying other religions to gain a glimpse into God's thoughts. Yet, ultimately, I fail to fully understand God because I am simply human.

But I want to know *how*, and God left us a clue. God didn't hide it; it's everywhere. We just need to understand to truly see, feel, and ultimately, perhaps even bend it. That's the ultimate goal. That's *my* goal. And once I achieve even a simple understanding, I want to share it with all humanity. That is my sole hope and dream.

So, how do you cast a fireball? I don’t know yet... but I will keep trying, until the end of this gift of life from God.

# Chapter 2: Culmination of Thoughts

Order versus chaos—these two opposing yet similar concepts form the universe. Simply put, **chaos and order exist.**

Imagine an atom, the smallest unit we can typically measure. Its central part, the nucleus, is a certain distance from its outer electron cloud. Let's consider the atom's nucleus (protons and neutrons) and its electrons as **chaos**, and the space between them as **order**.

Atoms combine to form molecules, then elements, then cells, and so on. But at the base of everything in the universe, there's also the concept of **space**—a void where nothing (presumably) exists. And it's all interconnected, just like atoms are. The difference between space (order) and elements (chaos) isn't truly a difference at all. They are both the same, yet not the same.

It's hard to imagine zero being one. But we know zero exists, and we use it in modern math. The power of zero is incredible and can be proven by modern formulas and theories. So why ignore ""nothing"" (space) when considering its actual effect on things around us? We can see its effect as a vacuum in outer space, but inside Earth's atmosphere, space remains just a concept.

What if we consider the empty space we see and feel on Earth as **Earth's order**? Since it's a type of order, then it's the same as chaos. And since they are both the same, could feeling nothing actually be feeling Earth's order in effect with our feeble existence? We can also think of it as the energy all around us that we can't comprehend—the **mana**, the ethereal. As I try to become a mage, a wizard, or whatever, I realize I must understand Earth's order, since I live here.

I've read many fantasy novels and theories, and the most basic magic spell is usually **light**, not fire. Photons are everywhere, and collecting them generally creates light (I think). But collecting photons feels similar to telekinesis, if photons were even tangible things we could collect. That's a huge ""if."" Photons are as debatable as dark matter, but advances in physics show they exist and are responsible for energy transfer, how we see things, and so on. Basically, a photon is fundamental. It's basic. Theoretically, it should be the first thing a mage learns to advance their casting. So, the most basic magic spell would be, **""Let there be light.""**

So, how can someone cast ""light"" as a magic spell? Do we imagine a floating light bulb? Does imagination truly work like that? How far can humans imagine and affect reality? Science is easier. Magic seems almost impossible, or rather, impossible right now. So, how?

I believe it's **mana**. Order represents Earth's mana. Perhaps we can use this concept to better understand how this ""invisible space"" between everything in the universe can physically alter things.

My first proposals are **detecting mana, imagining zero, and controlling space.** How? I don't know yet.

Our minds are confined by the physical world. Even if we concentrate intensely, our muscles might ache, sounds can disturb us, smells, touch—everything around us is both distracting and meaningful. So, if we can sense ourselves, can we erase ourselves? Can we only feel our surroundings? That's possible in theory but not exactly doable. Since zero is nothing, I need to start by erasing the concept of ""me"" as a human. This means total death or a pure, transcendent meditative ability. Realizing yourself not as who you are, but as nothing—closer to a spirit, perhaps, or a thought? It's illogical, but pursuing magic means pursuing what's closest to the truth of our universe.

# Chapter 3: Putting It into Practice

I'd just had this idea: to cast a basic magic spell, I might first need to eliminate my sense of self. Then I read about Buddha achieving enlightenment, and I wondered if it was the same concept. While Buddha's path to enlightenment is very specific and I can't follow it strictly, I still wanted to try some form of meditation.

So...

The epiphany hit me while I was on a stationary bike. It started with the thought of erasing my own self-perception. As I pondered this, my viewpoint shifted from myself to a spider. I imagined seeing my sleeping body through the eyes of the spider at my window. Did I succeed? No. But I felt like I was getting closer to dissolving ""me.""

This happened when I was finishing my household chores and doing a mild exercise routine. I was actually half-asleep, but I decided to push this idea of changing my point of view.

As I stared out the window while exercising, I saw two cows eating grass. I tried to imagine their perspective, and vaguely, I thought I could see what they saw. While trying to imitate or see through the cows' eyes, I began to wonder about the tree. How does a tree feel?

A tree, or plants in general, doesn't have the same feelings as humans or animals. We all react to stimuli for survival. Going beyond basic survival instincts means diving deeper into consciousness. However, the fundamental aspect is the feeling or stimulus that makes us react to our surroundings. Being aware of who you are, what you can do, and having the will to live is enough to navigate this world.

Anyway, as I was trying to imagine being a tree (with imaginary eyes), I wondered where my sense of sight would be. It seemed impossible. Would the tree's perspective be in its leaves? Branches? Trunk? Maybe even its roots? My imagination wandered through the entire tree, searching for where to place myself. But my thoughts were pulled back by the noise of people and vehicles passing by.

Next, I switched my perspective to a dog I saw walking past. I tried to guess the color of the roof of a tricycle I could hear in the distance. I couldn't see the vehicle myself, but the dog was clearly staring at it. So, while imagining I was seeing through the dog's eyes, I declared the roof was blue. I switched back to my own view and saw the tricycle's roof was black, but the driver's shirt was blue. Hmm... I started to become skeptical of what I was imagining.

After exercising, my next experiment was trying to switch my perspective from first-person to third-person. I imagined myself as an entity controlling an avatar (my body). It was incredibly hard, and quite scary. I haven't perfected it yet, but when I close my eyes, it's as if I can still see my surroundings as if my eyes were open. This prompted me to experiment further.

I walked normally but slowly, with my eyes closed, trying to see my surroundings as if my eyes were open, positioned just above my head. I controlled my body as if I were holding a joystick, moving here and there, picking up things, throwing them into a basket, and opening and closing doors. It was a completely new experience to simply feel my surroundings through sound, the floor beneath my feet, and the touch of my hand. It was as if I had no senses other than sight.

But it is unbelievably difficult. I will need to broaden my understanding of consciousness and my body. The most striking discovery was that I never felt tired doing mundane tasks like riding a stationary bike when I was in this detached state. But when I reverted to my body's consciousness, my butt hurt! I had completely overshot my usual workout time. Instead of being ""in the zone,"" it felt like being ""outside the zone."" This was dangerous because my body seemed to be on autopilot, not reacting to my conscious thoughts, which could lead to accidents and potentially harm others. This definitely shouldn't be done while driving.

So, without further delay, I will begin my experiments to cast a fireball. The first step is to gain complete control over my consciousness outside my ""avatar."" Why? To truly feel and see what the outside world is like. Perhaps the fundamentals of activating magic lie beyond the physical confines of the human body. It might begin with our conscious mind, free from the limitations of our embodied existence.

# Chapter 4: Discovering the Elemental Alignment

I was deep in thought, almost having a mid-life crisis the other day, when my perspective suddenly shifted. I'm thankful I was raised Christian; it seems to offer the most logical path to casting a fireball (more on that in Chapter 5) and a reason for a meaningful life, even when I sometimes find it unmeaningful.

My attempt to sense everything, to develop ""mana sense"" or whatever it is, was incredibly difficult. I simply couldn't grasp what I didn't know. But one night, as I napped, I stared at my room's wooden ceiling and noticed blurry, squiggly lines in my vision. For no clear reason, I raised my hand to touch them, and there it was—a complete magical circle, transparently floating between my fingers. Or so I thought.

I rushed outside and tried to replicate the effect by looking through my fingers, but it didn't work as I'd hoped. Still, I started thinking differently. Perhaps I simply couldn't sense, see, or feel this unknown energy (mana) around us. Weeks passed, and it felt horrible. I considered giving up, letting the crushing weight of my high blood pressure consume me.

A few more days went by, and I developed an unbearable headache. My blood pressure was still high, as usual, but my pulse was lower than 70 bpm. I was lost in thought. I hadn't been researching much lately for the sake of casting a fireball, so I knew I needed to change my monotonous routine. I started a daily regimen of coffee followed by thirty minutes on the stationary bike (Leg Day Everyday), hoping it would shift my perspective. And it did.

**Emptiness is form, and form is emptiness**—just as chaos and order are one, yet not the same. With this logic, I restarted my quest for the epic way to cast a fireball. As I sweated and pushed through the exercise, I gained optimism, which was great. So, I never skipped my ""Leg Day Everyday"" routine, even on Sundays.

A week later, I made my most exciting discovery: **casting fireballs might not be the simplest form of mana manipulation or magic.** It seemed much higher in the hierarchy of basic spells. I mean, combustion requires a lot of energy and materials to combust. Therefore, the simplest spells would likely involve wind or light.

I deduced that the most basic spell, if I could ever control mana, would be a **wind spell—guidance**. Air is everywhere. Simply blowing air from our mouths can push things. Even breathing creates a gust of air. The weakest initial spell must be a wind spell: guiding air (chaos) with order (a controlling mechanism) in a desired direction.

The next spell would be a **water spell**. After learning to guide something, the next step is stopping its motion and forming a stable shape. The simplest stable form is liquid. So, after mastering a wind spell, we could move on to a basic water spell. Following that would be an **earth spell**, which involves reinforcing the control. This would be trickier. After guiding and forming, you'd need to reinforce, a new way of using order (mana) to increase its level, changing a liquid into a solid, or even skipping the liquid phase from gas to solid.

Finally, after learning to increase control by mastering the earth spell, we could abruptly crush boundaries (control), causing the internal ingredients to combust—a **fire spell**. By releasing order onto compressed chaos, we could stimulate an explosion, or, with a very low level of control, a simple combustion spell. Building on the wind spell's basis, we could guide the combustion even further while reorganizing the particles, reinforcing our control, and ultimately casting a **Fireball**.

But it doesn't stop with just the control guidance mechanism. The elements of **light (chaos in motion)** and **darkness (order control)** could be explicitly explored once we mastered the four fundamental elements. Beyond that, even more possibilities could open up. Yet, everything begins with sensing the mechanism for guidance—order, mana, energy, will, force, etc.

In the end, I was still lost, despite having mapped out a basic spell hierarchy. I couldn't even sense mana, so all this felt meaningless. I needed a new perspective. I needed a new way to see what couldn't be seen. So, I began to imagine the world and everything in it as fake. This led me to become borderline crazy; I couldn't control my emotions or thoughts most of the time. I felt lost in thought, and my common sense began to vanish. It felt like I was floating into nothingness. I felt death approaching. I was lost, depressed, and lethargic. Is this normal?

The quest for casting a fireball seems so far yet so close. My thoughts are organized logically, but it feels impossible—it *is* impossible. A fiction, made-up fantasies. But wouldn't it be incredible if we could all cast magic? If science and magic merged? Then, even if robots had advantages in computing logic, they would lack the most basic essence to cast magic. It would be the biological beings' advantage over mechanical beings. Well, anyway, I guess it's not meant to be.

# Chapter 5: The Holy Scripture

The mid-life crisis that often hits around 40 is absolutely real, as are the increasing burdens on our bodies. But then, I suddenly remembered the biblical figures who lived for almost a thousand years. People in the early parts of the Bible had incredibly long lifespans, which can only be described as superhuman. Perhaps our shorter lifespans today are due to environmental changes and societal development. Or maybe it's something else entirely—a decline in humanity's blessings from God as generations pass.

As my thoughts of giving up on life (due to health issues and a lack of conventional goals) became the norm, I had an epiphany—a true eureka moment. I was watching a Netflix series, reading manhwa, and taking a quick break that day when it hit me. While researching the meaning and origin of ""mana,"" I stumbled upon the biblical term **""manna.""** This was the sustenance provided to the Israelites in the desert—a small, white, granular substance that fell from heaven each morning, tasting like flat cakes with honey, often called ""bread from heaven."" It was a daily miracle from God. Jesus himself later used this concept of manna to illustrate his role as the bread of life. If you search for the origin of the word ""mana"" online, you'll likely find it linked to a Polynesian language with a complex meaning, generally representing power, respect, and dignity.

So, essentially, I'm glad and thankful to be Christian, because at this moment, I realized the secret to casting a fireball might have had a user manual all along—the Bible itself (though it's clearly coded). Here are my main points.

# The Universe: Order, Chaos, and God's Intervention

Firstly, the universe is composed of **order and chaos**, yin and yang, two opposing forces, emptiness and form, and so on. The bottom line is: one plus one is one. In my opinion (not a fact, by the way), the universe originated from these two opposing forces mingling and clashing until everything we know came into existence. But how did they start mingling and clashing? It was due to an intervention: **""Let there be light,""** spoken by God.

It's tough to believe in God if you're more scientifically inclined or an atheist. But consider this for a second: we already have a **transcendental number (π)** that no one can fully quantify in its complete form, even today. Yet, it's a number representing control and binding, and it affects every basic notion of existence. Who set that in motion? **God!**

# Jesus Christ's Existence and God's Love

Secondly, after establishing the existence of God (or gods, if you prefer), let's consider this: **Jesus Christ existed**. People still debate his historical existence due to unreliable or insufficient evidence. However, if God exists, then it's logical to believe His son also existed to teach us, God's unworthy subjects, about His love. And what's the greatest proof of God's love? **It's us.** We exist, life began, all because of God's love. Period. I can't explain this further, but if these arguments still leave you skeptical, then so be it.

# The Holy Trinity and the God Realm

Thirdly, to complete the Holy Trinity, there's the **Holy Spirit**. According to the Bible, God, His Son (Jesus Christ—disciple, master, support, hand of God, healer, buffer), and the Holy Spirit are all equal. This implies (presumably) that they all possess the capacity to cast fireballs, or they understand this fictional concept I'm pursuing: **magic**. This is the God realm. Humans can't fully comprehend it, but we humans still crave it. So, for the sake of teaching people about God's love, Jesus Christ's sacrifice, and the Holy Spirit, I pray I can demonstrate it in real life: **magic**.

The truth is, I'd rather cast a healing spell than a fireball, but anyway, back to the main topic. The Holy Scripture, or the Bible, is a guide. I plan to read it earnestly, but cracking its code might be too much for me. I hope someone out there might continue this endeavor. For now, I'll lay out the basics of why I believe the Bible is the guide.

# Love, Mana, and the Path of a Wizard

God's love created life. Everything we see and feel comes from God. We, too, are made of God's love. So, what better way to feel everything (mana sense) than through **love**? Love is a powerful feeling, or perhaps not, but at its essence, it's what made life possible. Let's begin by assuming that to develop ""mana sensing,"" we must empty ourselves and completely envelop our entire being in **God's love**. Thus, the first step to becoming a wizard is **love**.

The next step for an apprentice in magic is to learn from someone who has already mastered it: **Jesus Christ**. He was an incredible healer, a buffer, creating miracles through God's name and love. And since in this modern age, we still heavily doubt God and His son, why don't we try seeking the truth by living as Jesus taught? It's not harmful; in fact, it's very fulfilling. We might even receive God's blessings, just like people in the past did, though it seems nonexistent now. Before, kings and leaders could pass on God's blessings, but now, I highly doubt anyone still possesses that ability—not even the Pope, I presume.

After channeling mana (God's love) and learning Jesus Christ's teachings, perhaps, just perhaps, we can develop our own approach to using God's love in our own way. While not limited to learning from Jesus or having God's blessing, there is also an option in learning from another source: the Holy Spirit.

Think of it this way: God is the king of the kingdom, His successor or heir is Jesus, and the Holy Spirits are like knights or attendants. And in this kingdom, magic exists. We, as commoners or villagers in God's kingdom, have no inherent right to wield magic, but because God loves us all, we are given the opportunity. Jesus is like the prince who travels to villages, preaching God's teachings and love, while the knights and attendants follow him. And in God's kingdom, there is perpetual peace and prosperity.

# Reality and the Quest Continues

Now, back to reality. Can we possibly do this here? Why not? I ask those who read these words to know and seek the truth of life, of the universe. There is no single truth in life, but all paths eventually lead to one. Everything is one, and one is many. An ending will always exist, but new beginnings will constantly rise.

As for me, my plan is to read the Bible during my ""Leg Day Everyday"" routine and try to decipher its code in accordance with my objective: casting a fireball. I will start by feeling God's love daily. I will learn from Jesus Christ's teachings. I will communicate with God through prayer (hoping to receive His blessings as a shortcut - hopefully). I will try to feel the Holy Spirit roaming around (I think they are roaming constantly). I will seek knowledge through the Bible, experience the feeling of God's love, formulate a working magical formula that can be applied in real life, and then teach it to others.

Wish me luck on my endeavor. I'm ending this entry here. I don't know how much time will pass, but I truly hope I reach my goal before my mortal body and spirit can no longer affect the human world.

After letting the shots sit in my fridge for a few weeks I cannot be happier with how everything is going! I defintiely read through 100s of posts in those weeks and wanted to thank all of you who post for sharing your experience (and tips!).

  
The most noticable thing to me (and something I didn't see mentioned so much) has been my energy levels. I've always been lazy and living in NYC I would typically avoid going out of my way for anything. Now I find myself getting up an hour earlier (I used to complain the hardest part of my day was getting out of bed) and going out of my way to try and get \~5000 steps on my way to work. Every time I'm outside I feel the urge to go out of my way and get extra steps in. I'm not even drinking coffee (I would religously drink a venti Cold Brew every day for the last few years). Do others have the same experience?

  
Outside of that my focus has been on 100+ oz of water a day, 120+ oz of protein, snacking on fruit, and opting for healthier options at meal times - I've avoided anything greasy or fried and am eating about 1700 calories a day. I've been using MyFitnessPal and Shotsy to track what I've been putting in my body and my progress and I find it has really helped steer me towards healthier options and keep me honest.

  
The weirdest thing I experienced was not enjoying a beer (drinking is a big part of my social life - one of my fears with the shot) and just having water the rest of the evening watching the Knicks.

For some context: I graduated in December 2020 with a degree in computer science. A couple of months later got a job as a SQL Data Developer, and worked almost 2 years. I was let go from that position and was unemployed for 10 months before I got a job as an auditor. I was misled by the position, which was not in any way a position where I could use my technical skills in but I stayed there another year while passively looking for something else. I was let go from that position and have been unemployed for 6 months. So out of the 4.5 years I have been out of college, I have worked for 3 of them and only had career-relevant experience for 2 of them. 

Currently the job market for computer science majors sucks. new positions have been down since the pandemic, Jobs in general have been declining since 2019, and currently the unemployment rate for my major is around 6% according to one article I read. In addition, my resume isn't that great now that I have 2 large unemployment gaps. 

  
My question now is, do I give up on that last 10 years of my life and give up on the stuff I genuinely enjoy doing, so I can start fresh in a new career, or should I stick it out and wait for a job in my career while I slowly hemorrhage money?

For as long as I can remember, I've always had trouble sleeping. I was teenager by the time I realized it wasn't normal to lay awake for two or three hours before finally falling asleep, and even then, I only sleep for a couple hours. I tried everything to ease my condition. I've tried melatonin, sleeping pills, exercise, alcohol, marijuana, white noise, warm milk, sensory deprivation, therapy, Ambien, hypnosis, magnesium supplements, valerian root, changing my diet, tea, Ativan, yoga, hot baths, ice baths... the list goes on and on. Most things didn't work at all, and the few that did would result in me not getting any *restful* sleep. I've had doctors look me over and paid way too much for a battery of tests to identify a cause. Nothing was ever found, so I almost gave up and just accepted that I would be tired forever. However, a while ago, I finally found something that helped.

I started keeping a notepad on my nightstand next to my bed.

I would write down whatever I was thinking about, just letting my thoughts flow onto the page. The first time I tried it, I settled into bed with the pen and paper and just started writing whatever came to my mind.

“I'm in bed. I want to sleep. I wish I could find out what it's like to dream.”

That was the first thing I wrote. Then, I was waking up the next morning feeling refreshed for the first time I could remember in my life. I actually cried a little once I realized I had slept for eight full hours. If that seems like an over reaction, you've never suffered from severe long term insomnia.

I looked back over the notebook after I calmed down a bit, just to see what all I had written. I remembered the first three sentences, but there was a little more after that.

“I hear a voice in the void. It is screaming. I can hear you.”

I didn't think too much of this, just chalking it up to ramblings of a man on the edge of somnolence, but it did creep me out a little. However, I didn't think about it beyond that as I went through my day.

The next night, I settled in a started jotting on the notepad.

“Was it a fluke? Will this work again? I hope I dream this time.”

I woke up the next morning after that feeling even better than I had the first time. I had a dream of an endless range of beautiful mountains that I was flying through. It was the most beautiful experience of my life. I looked over the pad to see if there would be anymore strange writing there, and I was not disappointed.

“Enjoy the dream.”

I was more than a little rattled by this. It was so simple that I could easily dismiss it, but it stuck in my mind like a splinter. I thought about it all that day, unable to shake the cancerous thought. I kept telling myself that I had written it on the edge of sleep and probably felt the dream coming on. It was probably something I wrote while on the edge of consciousness and I just wanted to tell myself to enjoy the experience. I mean, I did enjoy it immensely. I think it was the first dream I had ever had. Still, I felt a little unnerved by it all.

I settled back into my bed for the third night and pulled out the notepad and pen. I took a few deep breaths and let my thoughts wander freely from my head to the page.

“I loved the dream last night. I've never felt this good in my entire life. The weird messages are a little creepy, but I shouldn't let it get to me.”

That night, I dreamed of laying in my backyard, staring up at the stars twinkling like ice shards in the black sky. My fire pit was crackling lazily next to me. I couldn't see it from my position, but I could actually feel the warmth of the flames safe guarding me against the chill of the evening. It wasn't as exciting as flying around the mountains in my previous dream, but I didn't mind that. It was peaceful.

I woke up and looked at the notepad, wondering what strange note I had left myself this time.

“Don't let it unnerve you. Just watch the stars. You'll soon walk among them.”

The peace of the dream faded immediately as I read that final sentence. There was something sinister about it that I couldn't place my finger on. Walk among the stars? What the hell did that mean?

I felt a strange sense of foreboding for the rest of the day. I work at a warehouse as a certified forklift operator, which means my mind has plenty of opportunities to wander as I load pallets onto trucks or stack them in designated holding areas. The whole day, as I listened to the drone of the forklift's motorized workings, I kept wondering what that final message meant and kept coming up with nothing. I was still adjusting to all the extra energy the sleep was providing me with though, so I wasn't ready to stop using the notepad method yet.

I got home and actually felt energetic enough to cook myself a nice dinner of pan seared pork chops with fried apple and onion slices, then deglazed the pan with chicken stock and added ground mustard seed as well as butter to make a sweet and savory sauce to top it with. It was exquisite, and by the time I finished eating, all my anticipation had drained away.

I got in bed and reached for my pen and notepad to begin jotting down whatever came into my mind.

“I've decided I'm going to stop stressing over these notes I'm leaving for myself. It's worth it to have a good night's sleep. I wonder what weird messages I'll leave for myself tonight?”

That's as much as I remember writing. That night, I had another dream. I was standing in front of a mirror, but the reflection was hazy, as if I was trying to look through a thick fog. The result was a dark silhouette standing in the mirror, leaning closer as I leaned closer and shifting when I shifted. I was transfixed by the reflection, curious as to what it looked like, but unable to clearly make it out. I reached a hand to my face and rubbed my chin in thought, then jolted awake as the figure suddenly waved a hand of its own volition.

My heart was pounding in my ears as I sat upright in my bed. I felt a pang of dread as I leaned over to look at my notepad. The message this time obliterated any chance for dismissing the notes as meaningless.

“They're not from yourself. I see you.”

I didn't use the notepad that night. I just laid there, too scared to sleep, no matter how desperately I wanted to. Unfortunately, I had become acclimated to sleeping regularly, and the exhaustion I felt as I watched the night sky through my window turn from black to gray was worse than it had ever been. I almost called into work, but forced myself to go through the motions anyways.

I started feeling dumb, realizing I was being paranoid. I had cost myself the perfection of a night's rest and purchased miserable lethargy in its stead. It was a fool's bargain and I decided I would put my fears to the side this evening. I was still afraid of what these messages meant, but I was more afraid to go back to the hell that takes the place of the world when one is denied nocturnal respite.

I got into my bed and picked up the pen and notepad, hesitating only a moment as my eyes lingered on that final message. I shook the thought from my head, and pushed on.

“This is ridiculous. I'm myself. I'm leaving these notes. There is no other explanation. I'm done with being afraid.”

It was short and sweet, right to the point. I felt my eyes grow heavy as I was barely able to finish that last word and the ocean of sleep pulled me beneath its heavenly waves. Yet, those heavenly waves washed me ashore on the beaches of hell itself.

I was in some sort of dark cavern, the only light coming from guttering torches planted in the stone floor. They were scattered all about the enormous space, but seemed concentrated around some sort of throne with a dark figure sitting on it. It was hard to focus on the figure, like its body was wreathed in twisting tendrils of smoke. I could see it was covered in chains though. I felt myself being drawn to the base of the great stone chair, like a current pulling me inexorably along, no matter how hard I kicked against it. I stood before the throne and could feel the creature staring at me, though I wasn't even sure if it had eyes.

I felt my hand reach out and was surprised to see I was holding a weathered key. The figure gestured at a lock resting at the foot of the throne. I didn't want to unlock it, fearing what this hellish thing full of malevolence would wrought upon me when it was unbound, but once again, I was powerless to halt myself. I inserted the key and the lock popped open with a loud click.

And then my eyes opened and I was laying in my bed. I was covered in sweat and shivering. I could see the notepad sitting there on the nightstand, glaring up at me with the same threatening aura I had felt emanating from the thing on the throne. With a shaking hand, I picked it up and read the newest message.

“You are my bridge now. You are my dream. The throne awaits.”

I had been convincing myself that all of this were just ramblings, that I was suffering from paranoia, but I decided in that moment that something horrible was happening. I threw the notepad across the room, feeling tears well up in my eyes. I felt sick, but didn't hesitate to get out of bed.

I went downstairs to make coffee and fought the twin urges to put all of this out of my mind while also trying to make sense of it. Both attempts were futile.

I was also horrified to see I had slept for twelve hours. It is the longest I'd ever slept in my life. I decided then and there that I would not be using the notepad again. If I was doomed to never sleep a day again in my life, so be it. I'd rather die exhausted than let that... thing... have its way.

I went through my day as normal, doing my laundry, cleaning my home, shopping for groceries. As the banality of the day dragged on, I felt the tension filling my body began to ease a little. After all, life would continue as it had before the notepad. It may not be pleasant, but it would be familiar.

Unfortunately, that night I experienced a sensation I had never felt before. As the day degraded into night, I felt a strange heaviness around my eyes and realized that must be what it feels like to be sleepy. I fought the feeling all the way until midnight, then could fight it no longer. I laid down in my bed, spying the notepad from across the room laying on the floor where I had thrown it. If I had the energy, I would of gotten up and thrown it in the garbage, but I couldn't have left my bed if my house had been on fire.

The mounting dread did nothing to stay the hand of drowsiness that pulled my eyelids down, down, down into a darkness so complete that even my thoughts were dark blanks. After a while, I began to see pinpricks of light in the darkness, which confused me. I still felt like I was awake, but there they were, a multitude of stars shining from the inky well of the void I was in.

I was in a starry abyss, and by my side, though it was hard to make out, was the smoke wreathed figure walking with me. It spoke to me, spoke through me. It was my own voice, but the thing had hijacked it to communicate with me.

“Kneel before me and you shall walk among the stars.”

Suddenly, the stars winked out and I was shrouded in the darkness once more. For a moment, there was no light and no sound, but that only lasted for a couple seconds. Suddenly, I was on fire. My skin was burning and I tried to scream, but the silence persisted as I was consumed. I could feel my muscles contracting as they cooked, twisting me into a fetal position as I quivered in agony. The thing spoke again with my voice.

“Stand against me and you shall burn.”

I woke up on the floor next to my bed. I must have been thrashing around in my sleep because my blankets and sheets were twisted around me To my absolute horror, the notepad was next to me, and in large words that were hastily scrawled across the entire page was a new message.

“I am near.”

I looked at the clock and saw I had slept for fourteen hours. I called into my job and explained to my boss that I was sick, which wasn't exactly a lie. He wasn't happy, but accepted the explanation easily enough. I spent the day shopping for supplies for the evening. I was going to fight this. I would try everything to avoid kneeling before it.

I bought coffee and energy drinks, enough to give a rhino a heart attack. Hell, I'd of bought cocaine if I knew where to get drugs.

I got home and even though the sun was only just setting, I could feel that same sensation of exhaustion creeping into my body. I sat on my couch and began drinking all the caffeine I could. It didn't seem to help, and anger began to seep through me. I stormed upstairs and grabbed that damn notepad, went into my backyard and burned it. As the flames devoured the notepad, I thought of the dream where I had been on fire and shuttered. I couldn't shake the recognition of how similar the black flakes of burning paper were to my skin in the dream. Still, after the notepad was reduced to ash, I felt a little better. I went back inside and continued drinking energy drinks while watching TV.

I glanced at the clock every so often, noting the slow passage of time. Each hour felt like another victory, and before long, I was watching the sun dissolve the night sky. I had made it. I felt a bittersweet happiness, longing to feel the rest I had felt when I first used the notepad, but decided a pyrrhic victory was better than a total loss.

I got dressed and headed to work, attempting to return to some routine. I felt less and less tired as I went through the motions, driving my forklift and moving product about the warehouse. As I worked, my boss yelled my name out and waved me down. I got off the forklift and made my way to him.

“Feeling better?”

“Yea, I think so.”

“Good, we need all hands right now. Next time, if you're not going to be able to make it, make sure to call earlier. It gives me time to line up another driver on the schedule to cover your spot.”

“Yes sir. Sorry about that.”

“That's alright, just try to be better about it. The reason I waved you down though is someone is in the front office to see you. Seemed important.”

I felt a little confused, but started heading that way. Truthfully, I didn't have any idea who it could be considering I don't socialize with anyone. That's not an exaggeration, I don't have friends, I don't go out and I don't have any living family. My existence is solitary, a result of my insomnia making it impossible to talk to people for any other reason than necessity.

By the time I reached the office, my mind was racing. I walked in and saw the receptionist look up at me. She was talking on the phone and held up a single finger, silently mouthing the words “one moment.”

I took a seat on one of the cheap chairs against the wall and politely waited for her to finish. She hung up the phone after a while and called out to me.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, there's a man to see you in the conference room.”

I nodded my appreciation and made the short walk to the conference room. I walked in and screamed as I saw what was on the other side of the door.

The conference room was gone. In its place was the dark cavern with the throne. The unchained and smoke shrouded figure stood up as I walked in and seemed to grow taller as it did so. I turned to run, but the door had vanished behind me. I collapsed to the ground, gasping for air as the fire began to consume me once more. The thing slowly walked towards me until it loomed over me, its dark form vanishing in a wreath of flames and smoke from my smoldering skin.

I heard it speak, this time in a voice that sounded like stone on stone mixed with the crackle of fire.

“I have arrived.”

I woke up in my bedroom, my whole body aching. As my eyes adjusted, I could see the walls of my bedroom had large words covering every inch of them.

“I have arrived.”

The message was scrawled over and over again. My heart was beating in my ears and I screamed aloud in frustration. I checked my phone and saw I had been asleep for almost two days.

I know this will be my last few moments of consciousness. I don't know how I know that, but I do. I know that I have a choice to make. I've become convinced that the entity doing this to me is the devil, or some kind of demon. It is something of pure evil. If it comes through into our world, it will bring about the end of everything.

I don't know why this has happened to me. I'm not sure that matters anymore. I have to choose if I'm going to kneel and damn everyone to this things machinations or pick the other option.

I wanted to send out this last message to the world I hardly ever spoke to. No one may read it and even those that do will likely never care, but I needed to make sure there was some record of what I've done and why I've done it. This isn't just my way of seeking some measure of solace in glorifying myself, or expressing self pity for my plight. This is my warning to you all. There is a thing wreathed in smoke and darkness, a thing that is trying to break into our world. I know it will not stop until it does. All it needs is someone to kneel to it.

I took a long time thinking this through, unsure if there was any other thing I could I do in my situation. Finally, I've come to the conclusion that there is no other way. This is not a decision that I made easily, but one I agonized over for as long as I could. I want to keep fighting, but I know that I've lost. Yet, even in my defeat, I can deny this enemy its most prized asset.

I'm looking at the rope hanging before me. I'm full of fear and misery, wishing there was any other thing I could do, but I feel my eyes growing heavy once again and know that I must act now. I won't have another chance once I slip away again.

If you ever wake up to find messages you don't remember writing and are visited by a smoke shrouded figure in your dreams, you must make this same choice.

My life has been a difficult one, full of loneliness and exhaustion. I fear the end of it none the less. Despite this, I still rather choose this than choose to kneel to that monster.

I also haven’t lost any weight in the last month, and I got told, among other things, to not even drink decaf tea. Not sure how much I believe that, but switching from coffee to black/green tea is about the best I can do without adding splitting headache to my symptoms. Bad enough I teach at a year-round school and don’t sleep for shit. 
  
So when I got weighed, the depression came back immediately, and between the restrictions and the doctor suggesting I speak with a weight loss specialist about injections, I can’t wait for the obsessive calorie counting and depression every Friday morning when the scale doesn’t move. Waiting for next week when I have another follow up with my stress fracture.  
  
I might just start drinking again. Fuck it.

I love staying home for the kids and for my own personal reasons, but the financial piece I guess we’re just not ready for it. (Btw before there are any sassy comments yes we’re saving for ourselves and our kids, that’s included in our budget)

All of my close mom friends are two income houses, my SAHM acquaintances are either home because their spouse is very very wealthy or if their income is low they live with their parents (which we’re honestly considering too) who fund most things so they live like higher income people. I’ve really tried to find people who truly have cut these things too, but just seems not possible. 

When my close mom friends get together, it’s usually restaurants, zoo, museums, etc. I always have to say no. the mom group at my church usually meets at a restaurant or brewery. Acquaintances alwaysss want to do coffee which is like $8 for a latte and just adds up. I always have to skip those. My best friend invited us today to their family trip at a kids resort and I had to say no. My husbands best friend invited us yesterday to their family road trip and we had to say no. Our kids are the same age and play so well together, but we just can’t afford either trip! 

I have to beg and plead everyone for free activities like parks or hanging out in the house/yard. I’ll make you guys food because I know people are burned out. I’ll make coffees so we don’t have to go to a coffee shop! I’ll host so you don’t have to clean! But people wanna be out (which I get, change of scenery is nice!!)! A couple days ago I saw a story of some of my friend group out at an expensive brewery with their kids without me and I guess it’s the point where they’re just doing things without inviting me because they know I’ll say no 😭

Then our non parent friends there are so many weddings this summer that we’re invited to or a part of and that gets so expensive too. At least my mom friends will sometimes wanna do free stuff but my non parent friends neverrr agree to it and at this point our relationships are just over text :/

Usually there is that euphoria of ""i'm doing it!"" that can last like 3-4 days, start sleeping better, etc. This time it was less than 24 hours. Cleaned the condo, worked on the garden, sleeping a little better. 

The insomnia is start to really creep in, struggling to get to bed before 2am. I feel like I'm slowly programming my mind and body to sleep without whiskey, which is kinda the goal. I'm starting to think, even with the excessive exercise, I'm wired to be awake for long periods of time and I have to start waking up at dawn to get to bed before midnight. 90% of my work is done between 9am and lunch so it's crucial that I'm caffeinated and at my desk making phone calls but not too caffeinated to where you can start to taste colors.

The problem is...the stress is starting to get to me. I'm self employed and the economy has basically failed while everyone just kinda dances around with their hands over their ears saying ""it's fine"". Working non stop, on Memorial day, on weekends, still can't make enough money.

I've been trying to cut back on weed during the day. It's just not the coping mechanism that it used to be. Like fuck I am so stressed at this issue. I'll smoke some weed to give me that curiosity that I love about what I do for a living. Except now it's just ""great, now I'm high and still stressed, wonderful"".

I think I'm going to become a ""before and after dinner"" weed person and maybe get high and go for a walk on a Saturday morning kinda thing instead.

That's actually the main reason I decided to put it down. I'm just not going to drink until I'm financially comfortable enough to. The health benefits are nice, I'm working out pretty much constantly but I'm going 2-3 days without seeing another human being because I'm just hiding from the world.

I knew today was going to be rough. Had to leave the comfort of home to get my car's oil changed. This is pretty much a big trigger for me, driving in all the bullshit traffic. Bars everywhere, just stop in for a shot of jager and a beer. Send some emails, off to the next one. Trying to scratch the itch of being part of society and it honestly doesn't even work. Just bored bartenders who are also feeling the pinch of the economy collapsing. So fuck it, no more.

There's a little diner near where I live and I've been going in and just sitting at the counter and drinking coffee. I totally get why coffee is served at AA meetings, it's just a little taste of the euphoria.

My feature spec Sleeper (I’ve posted about it here before, action/comedy about a terrorist oversleeping and missing the flight he was supposed to blow up) was/is getting *some* traction in Hollywood (scored me some generals, quarterfinalist at Nicholl and Final Draft Big Break, earned high praise from producers, and still get read requests/praise from managers/producers randomly every few weeks or so.) I’m currently working on a Horror/Comedy called AbracaSTABra (about a killer magician) with a director and producer, and we have a semi-known actor attached, just trying to raise some $$$.

Any like-minded writers down to meet up? Would love to hang and connect! I'll be in town June 18-23.

I followed people’s advice on my last post when I could and updated my itinerary accordingly. The plan each day was to have breakfast at the hotel, have an edible before every meal out, and split everything (except Lou's). Here is everything we feasted on in the great city of Chicago:

* **Day 1:** *The Purple Pig*: this was the first stop after check-in and it started off the trip on a fairly mediocre note. I had gotten some comments that suggested I shouldn’t have this on the list, but unfortunately I couldn’t switch it. We got the **tuna tartare, grilled calamari, and pork belly**. The tartare was fresh and the combination of avocado, tuna, mango was solid. The cracker it came with paired well. It was nothing special or inspired, but I liked it well enough. Unfortunately, it was the best of the dishes. Although the pork belly was cooked well, I felt like both it and the calamari relied too heavily on sauce for their flavor (lemon-y and sweet, respectively). Simply because there are so many better options, I would not recommend this place to a visitor.
* **Day 1:** *Maxwells Trading*: wow, wow, wow. On 15mg, we split the **soft shell crab, the oyster mushroom rice pot, the sea bass, and the Japanese sweet potato**. The rice pot and the sweet potato were absolute standouts. I would be buried with rice if I could and the rice was cooked *perfectly*; the mushrooms were tender, and then the truffle butter tied it all together in a gorgeous, fatty glaze that really let the umami burst through. My favorite accompanying sauce was that brown one. My partner loved the homemade sriracha. The sweet potato made me see Jesus. I have no words for that. We saved the sauce in that for the rice because why not? The sea bass was also very good (if I’m being nitpicky, it was my least favorite), and the soft shell crab was phenomenal! We closed out after this, but then I decided that even though I don't like desserts, we were celebrating! And if any place was going to make something I'd like, I trusted Maxwells. I got the **Forbidden rice pudding** and I swear my eyes did that spiral thing you see on cartoons. I *loved* the deconstructed nature of this with the crispy rice, the soft and sweet mango, and whatever that whipped/creamy thing was on top.  
* **Day 2:** 
   * *Lou Malnati’s* on Wells: my partner got a **personal Classic** while I got **garlic bread and a Malnati salad** (gorgonzola on the side). He really liked his deep dish and I had a piece of his crust, which was buttery and delicious; it tasted like something I’ve had before but I can't put my finger on it. I really liked my salad and the dressing was fantastic - I was nervous it would be too sweet but it was not at all. Also, I know the garlic bread is probably just some basic supermarket bread, but I ate that entire thing by myself because the sauce was fucking phenomenal - tomato-y, herb-y, and not too sweet. I would sip it like a soup appetizer if I could. 
   * *Thattu*: interesting ""self-service"" concept here! We started off with the **kerala fried chicken bites** which had good crunch with excellent ""breading"" to meat ratio (it's GF I noticed), but I found it too salty. I did not have the yogurt that came with it, but I think even with that, it would have been too salty (my partner disagrees). The pickled onions were a nice acidic and sour contrast though. The **kadala curry** was very good, even though the chickpeas were a little harder than I expected (perhaps this is common with black chickpeas?) The **appam** was excellent: big and fluffy with a very mild nutty sweetness to it. It made a fantastic vehicle for the rest of our meal. And last but not least was the **chemmeen & kappa**. The prawns were cooked wonderfully and yucca mash was also very good. Then, inspired by experience at Maxwells, I also got the **payasam** with raisins. This was more like a ""traditional"" rice pudding, and I loved it.
* Day 3: 
   * *Cafe 53*: we actually didn't mean to stop here, but my partner was looking for coffee after the DuSable Museum but before Virtue, and this place had good reviews. We loved it. He liked his coffee and we also ended up getting a **lemon bar, blueberry/lemon scone, and spanakopita**. As soon as I peeped the gigantic lemon bar in the display window, I was game (and high). It was crazy good. The crust:custard ratio was perfect, the crust was sturdy enough to maintain its integrity after splitting and I think it was graham cracker-style? Whatever it was, I loved it. But the custard part was where it really shined: thick and perfectly lemon-y (sweet but *mostly* tart). Wow. The scone was pretty good - not that sweet, which I loved (can you tell the theme here?). My partner thought it was a good coffee accompaniment. And the spanakopita was good too, but perhaps nothing special.
   * *Virtue*: an hour later, we came for our reservation here and the plan was to get only the **blackened catfish and cornbread with honey butter**, but we also added the **gumbo** and I was so glad we did. I have never had gumbo so I can't compare, but the sausage was delicious (well-cooked, nicely spiced and seasoned). If I'm being nitpicky, it was a tad salty but again, I've never had gumbo before. The catfish was excellent - flaky and well-seasoned. Everything on that plate was wonderful, including whatever yellow/orange sauce thing was on the bottom. And finally, the cornbread: hot, moist but sturdy on the inside, and crispy on the outside and edges. I asked for the butter on the side ""to control the amount of butter"" I ate - ha! I was spreading butter on the top, sides, and bottom of my bites, dipping my bites in the butter, etc. 
   * *The Publican*: were actually weren't supposed to come here, but because plans to go to Volo Restaurant for their oyster happy hour on Day 2 didn't work out, I decided to book a reservation since I like trying oysters in new places. So 2 hours after Virtue, we got **a dozen** **oysters** that were so fresh (mostly MA, one WA). Although based on the shells I do think we got 3 of one and only 1 of another. We were also originally supposed to *only* get oysters, but the munchies were strong despite being on the tail-end of our high, so we also split the **broccolini**, and it perfectly charred. The miso bagna cauda was great, but the herb tahini was the best part. I was scraping that shit with my fork. 
   * *Avec*: despite re-upping with another edible, here is where my partner started to tap out, unfortunately (for him though because this meant more for me and I was so excited). It did *not* disappoint. The food was incredible. I swapped out Girl and the Goat for this last minute and I could have cried if I had missed this. I almost cried right there in the restaurant. We got: chorizo-stuffed dates, the wild Mexican prawns, potato and salted cod brandade, and the short-rib hummus. This was the best place to save for last. I loved every second of it. 

My partner and I were so painfully full by the end that it hurt to laugh and we woke up full, uncomfortable, and very happy (at least I was). I came to Chicago to celebrate an enormous personal accomplishment with my favorite thing in the world (food) and the mission was accomplished with 5 stars, no notes. I was in my element, my dream state, my personal bliss. And it wasn't even just the food I loved - I loved your whole city. We spent a lot of time walking around and visiting museums, the lakefront, and green spaces and by the end of Day 2, I already knew I would be back. Thank you so much Chicago.

I (26F) met Donny (30M) on Bumble a few months ago, and things moved fast — mostly because he was the one pushing for it.

Our first date was dinner and a spontaneous comedy show. It was fun, but I was still keeping my options open.

Second date, he made me steak and potatoes at his place and then took me to a live music event. He later told me he had *never* made anyone dinner on a second date before and called it the best date of his life. At the time, I wasn’t feeling a strong physical connection, and I considered backing off, but we kept texting daily. He was away for work, and I was on a trip, so we didn’t see each other again for almost a month.

On our third date, he wanted to take me to a fancy dinner for my (late) birthday, but I said that was too much, so we kept it casual. I ended up spending the night for the first time, and something shifted. He was coming across as emotionally available and genuinely interested in me. My feelings started to change.

A few days later, we met for coffee, and he told me he wanted us to be exclusive. That was technically only our fourth date. I told him I wasn’t ready yet but wanted to keep seeing him and see where it went. He said he was fine with that and willing to wait.

Throughout April, we kept getting closer. I stopped seeing the only other person I’d been dating casually and focused on Donny. He made significantly more money than me and would regularly pay for meals, drinks, Ubers, etc., which I appreciated. He kept making comments about wanting a relationship but always said he understood that I needed to take things slow. I had been burned before and was trying not to rush anything.

At the end of April, I felt ready, and we made things official. We were boyfriend and girlfriend.

Two weeks later, I invited him to my graduation family dinner. I even told him he didn’t have to come — he insisted on joining. He met my whole family. It seemed to go well.

After making things official, I started noticing things that gave me pause. I began to feel unheard, talked over, and generally dismissed. He made comments like “I like to spend money like an asshole.” He would throw away six to eight plastic water bottles a day without recycling. He often spoke poorly about friends he claimed were close. His entire lifestyle seemed focused on maximizing convenience — and that started to show in how he handled the relationship too. I was commuting two hours from outside the city to see him (and for work/friends), and he never once came to me.

Then, completely out of nowhere, he sent me a text saying my *hygiene habits* were a “showstopper” for him, and he was feeling “overwhelmed by the pace” of our relationship and wanted to take a step back.

This was confusing on multiple levels.

1. **He set the pace.** He was the one who pushed for exclusivity, pushed for official status, gave me a key to his apartment, invited me to a wedding at the end of the year, and made future plans.
2. **I gave him outs.** When I stayed over three nights in a row (which was a first), I told him I could stay with a friend one night — he told me not to. When I invited him to my family dinner, I said he didn’t have to come — he insisted.
3. **The “hygiene” thing came out of nowhere.** For context: he showers and uses mouthwash multiple times a day. I typically shower every other day (but also sometimes daily) and have never in my life once been told I smell, have bad breath, or am unhygienic. He had bought mouthwash for me to keep at his place, and I thought it was a sweet gesture at the time — not a sign of judgment.

After he sent the breakup text, I called him, and we talked for 30 minutes. He said his “OCD” made my hygiene habits difficult for him. He also said, “I know I’m very difficult to be with” and admitted the breakup was “90% his fault.”

A week before all this, I had met his parents. We had made future plans. I was starting to settle into the relationship. I thought he was genuine when he told me I deserved to be treated well and that he could see I hadn’t been in the past.

Now, looking back, all those words feel empty. It feels like the rug was pulled out from under me.

I’ve never felt so confused and caught off guard. Has anyone else experienced something like this?

**TL;DR:**  
Started dating someone who pushed for commitment early, gave me a key, met my family, and said all the right things. A month into being official, he dumped me via text over my “hygiene” (despite them falling well within normal habits). He later admitted he has ""OCD"" and said it was mostly his fault.

1kws9ct,https://www.reddit.com/r/roommateproblems/comments/1kws9ct/i_dont_like_my_roommate/,I don't like my roommate,"I don't really think I am looking for advice, because I know I will only be living with her for the rest of this lease, so none of these things seem worth bringing up and making things awkward and uncomfortable. So really, this is more of a rant. 
I am just so fed up living with her. The biggest issue is that she literally doesn't do ANYTHING. When I first spoke with her, she told me that her mom would be paying her rent because she goes to school. She told me she worked ""part time"" but that it wasn't enough to pay for rent. That was fine with me. I didn't really care as long as the rent got paid. Turns out by ""going to school"" she meant taking only one online class at home, not even going to campus, and by ""working part time"" she meant only FOUR hours a week at a local coffee shop. HUH? 
Despite this, I thought she would at least be gone to hang out with friends or visit her family, right? Wrong. She has ONE friend who lives an hour away and they are both scared of driving long distances and driving at night, so they only see each other like once every other month MAX. Also, when they do hang out, she comes over to our place. She also despises her family and never visits them even though they’re a 20 minute drive away (which I don't get considering they pay for everything for her). 
Also, she literally just does not do anything. Literally nothing but sit in her room all day every day, laying in the same spot on her bed and watching Grey's Anatomy, sleeping, or sometimes knitting. Everything she does is the easiest mode possible. Groceries? Delivered. Mom paid for them by the way. But then she will still get Grubhub every night of the week and the groceries rot in the fridge. Cleaning? Nope, never. She uses plastic disposables for everything and every single meal. She is literally here ALL THE TIME. 
And I was trying really hard not to judge, because I understand that people can be depressed and have a hard time with things, but it's just her way of living and I can't ever see her changing! 
She is scared to go anywhere alone, and since her friend lives an hour away, she has started asking me to do stuff with her. Like to go get her prescription or drop something off at the post office. Girl, you are 22. I said okay a few times, but started saying no because I have my own stuff to do! I work hybrid, and it's also like she doesn't understand that when I am at home during the 9-5 week, I am still working. And my door will be open a crack so my cat can get in and out, but she will yell my name from her room and ask me to run an errand with her. Sometimes while I am in a meeting! I have told her that I hate that and I also hate last minute plans, but she hasn't changed anything. I feel like I can't relax in my own apartment because she is always there and I feel like I am always waiting for her to shout my name and try to get me to go with her somewhere.
I am pissed because while she technically didn't lie, she was obviously being deceitful when we met by telling me she works ""part time"" and GOES to classES. We also just have nothing in common and I can't stand people who weaponize their incompetance. I do everything around here. One time I was on a road trip and a pipe burst, and she started freaking out and texting me because she couldn't handle it herself. I had to come back home to deal with it myself. And she said to me ""I am a full grown, capable adult, but I don't do this kind of stuff."" ...HUH!? Then you aren't a capable adult! I feel like I am living with a child! 
She always asks me to hang out but only when it's something her friend cancelled on because she can't fathom the idea of doing anything alone. She never asks about my interests or even stops to think that I am not into the stuff she is, so NO I don't want to spend an entire day at a Grey's Anatomy fan meet up, or a heavy metal concert in a mosh pit. I don't like that stuff and would be bored out of my mind! I have said no to all of these things, so why can she not take a hint!

Update while this has been sitting in my drafts: her only friend broke up with her last night because she is ""too much to handle"" and she already told me about it and is asking me to go to a 5 day event with her! At this point I am so over this and I immediately said no and reminded her that I am not interested in the same stuff she is. I have already told her this before by the way, but it never seems to stick. I am NOT looking forward to being asked to do everything with her because she now has ZERO friends.
Also I’ve realized that I have a hard time saying no to things bc she constantly tells me how she’s always having some sort of episode and complains to me about everything and I’m scared that I will make the vibe in the apartment weird by saying no all the time. I know it’s not my fault if I just say no and she gets mad at me, but I still have to deal with it if it happens..",0,1748364581.0,roommateproblems,1,0.5,False
1kws94j,https://www.reddit.com/r/waterfilterreviews/comments/1kws94j/why_choose_glacier_fresh_gf004_refrigerator_water/,Why Choose GLACIER FRESH GF-004 Refrigerator Water Filter Review for Pure Water,"**Durable Build and Convenient Design**  
Using the GLACIER FRESH GF-004 refrigerator water filter has been an interesting journey in terms of design functionality. Its compact dimensions (1""D x 1""W x 1""H) make it a perfect fit for refrigerators without adding any bulk. It's surprisingly lightweight at just over 2 pounds, making installation a breeze even for someone like me, who's not naturally handy. What stood out for me was the ease of replacing the old filter with this one—no tools, no fuss. The design is user-friendly, and the fit is snug, which means there’s no dripping or misalignment.  

The filter combines attractive aesthetics with functionality, built from carbon fiber material that feels durable. Over time, I found that the compatible design seamlessly integrates into my refrigerator setup without affecting daily use. Unlike generic filters that sometimes look out of place, this one blends in easily without any awkward gaps or movement.

[Check GLACIER FRESH GF-004 price on Amazon.](https://usedwater.com/price/b0cphkz968/)  

**Impressive Filtration Performance**  
My daily usage revealed that this water filter delivers on its promise of clean and great-tasting water. With an extra-grade coconut shell carbon block, it effectively removes impurities and minimizes the chlorine taste and smell commonly found in tap water. I noticed an immediate improvement in water clarity and taste after installation, crucial since I’m particularly picky about drinking water quality.  

Certifications like NSF assure a level of trust, and having tested it across a variety of use cases—cooking, brewing coffee, and preparing chilled drinks—I've been impressed. It managed to retain the freshness in water consistently, no matter the time of day or usage frequency. What’s particularly interesting is how it encourages you to drink more water purely because it tastes better! Suddenly, hydrating becomes a more enjoyable part of the routine.  

**Long-Term Usage and Replacement Interval**  
This filter claims to last for six months or 200 gallons of water, and I’m glad to confirm that in my case, this has been largely accurate. Rather than sticking post-it notes everywhere reminding me when to replace it, I appreciate the duration indicator on the packaging. It fits my family’s daily needs comfortably without frequent replacements, which saves not just money but also the effort.  

Six months might not seem like a long time, but as someone who deals with heavy water usage, I find this duration realistic and practical. I remember reading reviews doubting its longevity, but in my experience, it’s held up even amidst constant use.  

**Highlights**  
- Easy-to-install design makes replacement hassle-free.  
- Offers noticeably cleaner, better-tasting water.  
- Certified for safety and quality (NSF certification).  
- Durable and practical for long-term use without frequent replacements.

**Shortcomings**  
- Adjustment during installation can be slightly finicky.  
- Doesn’t fit every refrigerator model universally; double-check compatibility.  
- The replacement schedule might feel short for larger households.  

**Good Aspects**  
The positives outweigh any grievances I’ve had, though. The carbon fiber build ensures robust filtration, and the lightweight, compact shape fits seamlessly into my appliance setup. Additionally, it's compatible with multiple filter models like 4396841 and EDR3RXD1, making it versatile for those already using compatible refrigerators.  

- Effectively eliminates impurities, keeping water fresh.  
- Compact design without unnecessary bulk.  
- Extended compatibility with different refrigerator brands.  

**Negatives**  
There’s room for improvement in compatibility and convenience. For first-time users, matching it with your fridge might involve some trial and slight adjustments. The six-month duration may feel insufficient for larger families or heavily used kitchens, though this could vary by personal needs.  

- Compatibility isn’t universal, so double-check before purchasing.  
- Six-month lifespan might feel limited for busier households.

**Product Comparisons**  
In the world of in-refrigerator water filters, competitors like PUR and EveryDrop have been my go-to references for quality comparisons. For instance, EveryDrop filters boast a slightly broader range of compatibility and branding recognition. However, I found that this GLACIER FRESH product feels sturdier and slightly edges out in taste improvement over competitors.

When stacked against PUR filters, which often advertise similarly extensive filtration, this model fared better in terms of flow consistency. On the downside, EveryDrop's extended usage cycles (sometimes stretching up to 9 months) can offer better cost efficiency in specific scenarios. Nonetheless, the compact design and immediate flavor quality improvements of this filter still made a significant impression compared to others.  

**True Value for Daily Use**  
The price range felt fair in relation to its features and performance. What I appreciate most is the noticeable improvement in water cleanliness without burning a hole in my pocket. Many similar products promise the moon and fall short, but this one just works without unnecessary frills. While it’s not the cheapest option on the market, the overall filtration quality and ease of use justify the investment for me.

1kws5g8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/1kws5g8/usdc_or_lightning/,USDC or Lightning?,"I’ve been following the rollout of **Steak n Shake’s new Bitcoin terminals** (which is wild, honestly) and noticed a pretty healthy debate on X (Twitter) about which cryptocurrency option will ultimately become the go-to for businesses—particularly small businesses.

On one hand, we’ve got the **Lightning Network**, a scaling solution for Bitcoin that enables faster, cheaper transactions. On the other hand, there are **stablecoins** like **USDC** (which major payment processors like **Stripe** and **Square Pay** have signaled support for). This begs the question: **if you’re a small business owner, which option makes more sense?**



Here’s the debate as I see it at this point:

**⚡ Lightning Network**

* Pros: Near-instant transactions with super low fees (we’re talking fractions of a cent). It’s directly tied to Bitcoin, which could attract die-hard BTC enthusiasts. Also, there’s the narrative that “Bitcoin is sound money,” and some people genuinely prefer paying in BTC.
* Cons: Lightning is still somewhat niche with specific wallets needed. The user experience for both merchants and customers can be clunky compared to traditional credit card systems. There’s also the price volatility of Bitcoin itself, which can be a headache for businesses trying to manage cash flow.

**💵 Stablecoins (like USDC)**

* Pros: Stablecoins offer price stability (1 USDC = $1), which businesses love. Plus, big processors like Stripe and Square Pay are making it easier to integrate USDC into existing systems. For customers, paying with a dollar-pegged coin feels more intuitive and less risky than paying with Bitcoin.
* Cons: Depending on how payments are handled, there might still be crypto-specific complexity. Also, stablecoins are only as stable as the regulations and companies backing them. USDC, for example, has been through some ups and downs with market perception.



**Why does this matter?**

For small businesses—think your local coffee shop, indie retailer, or service provider—the decision of which crypto payment option to integrate isn’t just about technical features. It’s about **ease of use**, **customer demand**, **fees**, **regulatory compliance**, and the potential **future-proofing** of their payment systems.

As far as I can tell, both **Stripe** and **Square** are moving toward supporting **both Lightning and stablecoins**, so merchants might not have to choose one or the other eventually. But for now, adoption on the Lightning side seems slower outside of Bitcoin-heavy communities, whereas **USDC and other stablecoins are gaining more traction with mainstream payment platforms**.

Personally, I think we’ll see small businesses favor stablecoins in the short term, since they’re more aligned with how people already think about money. **Lightning might become more appealing as the technology matures and the Bitcoin narrative continues to gain traction.**

I’m curious what the /cryptocurrency community thinks. **If you ran a small business and had to choose between accepting Bitcoin Lightning payments or stablecoins like USDC, which would you pick and why?** Are there other options I should be considering?



Also, if anyone has experience using either in a real-world business, I’d love to hear about your experience.

Compact yet mighty, this ice-making marvel sits snugly on my kitchen counter, surprising me daily with its efficiency and design. Its 44lbs per day ice-making capacity paired with the stainless-steel finish makes it both a functional and stylish addition to any space. As someone who hosts frequent gatherings, I’ve tested its capabilities rigorously, and there’s plenty to share.

**Eye-Catching Design and Practical Dimensions**  
This ice maker combines aesthetics with functionality. At just 9.53"" x 13.78"" x 14.57"" in size, it fits seamlessly on my countertop without eating up precious kitchen real estate. The angled flip-top cover is an ergonomic touch, making it super easy to scoop out ice whenever needed. The stainless steel adds a modern look and makes it easy to wipe clean. Its weight of 25.85 pounds may not be ideal for frequent relocations, but it’s perfect for a fixed spot like a home bar or kitchen corner. I loved the thoughtfulness behind its design; even my relatives visiting for BBQ nights often compliment its sleek build.

**Two Water Filling Options for Versatility**  
I found the two ways to add water to be extremely convenient. On busy mornings, manually adding water directly to the reservoir is quick and straightforward. On the other hand, during house parties, attaching a 3.0-liter water bottle ensures that the machine stays replenished without needing to constantly check. It’s worth noting that the water bottle isn’t included, which might be a minor inconvenience for some. 

[Check Silonn SLIM31T price on Amazon.](https://fridgefanatic.com/p/b0ddpv2wtq/)

**Impressive Ice Output and Speed**  
During a recent office gathering, I tasked this gem with providing ice for about 20 people. Within just 13 minutes, it churned out 24 crystal-clear ice cubes. And by the end of the day, it had produced close to its daily maximum of 44lbs. The clear cubes not only look great in cocktails but also melt much slower than traditional cloudy ones. Whether it’s a casual iced coffee or crafting an old-fashioned cocktail, the option to control the ice thickness proved pretty handy.

**Automatic Cleaning for Added Convenience**  
The cleaning cycle was a feature I underestimated until I used it. With a press of a button, the machine runs a 20-minute cleaning cycle that ensures the machine stays fresh and functional for future use. For a person like me, who can’t spare much time for appliance maintenance, this feature is a lifesaver. It’s also great for peace of mind, knowing that the cubes come from a hygienic source. However, while the cleaning cycle is handy, I noticed it doesn’t entirely clean the smaller crevices, so manual wiping is occasionally needed.

**Perks**  
- Compact size makes it suitable for countertops, home bars, and offices.  
- Flipping angled top cover allows easy access to ice for scooping or monitoring levels.  
- Crystal-clear cubes minimize drink dilution and enhance aesthetics.  
- Automatic cleaning reduces maintenance hassles.  

**Less Favorable Aspects**  
- The water bottle for direct connection isn’t included, which could increase setup costs.  
- Despite the cleaning cycle, occasional manual cleaning of tight spaces is necessary.  

**Market Rivals**  
When I compared this model with other ice makers like the GE Profile Opal and Igloo ICEB26HNSS, the Silonn SLIM31T stood out for its compact design and faster ice production. The Opal’s nugget-style ice may appeal to some, but let’s face it—the price point leans toward premium. Igloo’s model offers basic features but lags behind in speed and doesn’t include a cleaning cycle. The Silonn strikes a perfect balance between affordability and premium features like adjustable ice thickness and automatic cleaning. However, unlike competitors with companion apps, this machine lacks a smart connectivity option, which could be a deal-breaker for tech enthusiasts.

**True Value**  
In terms of cost-efficiency, this countertop ice maker brings serious value to the table. Given its stellar ice production, durability, and features like dual water filling and cleaning cycles, it feels like a worthwhile investment. Sure, it doesn’t come with fancy additions like Bluetooth connectivity, but unless you’re managing a high-end bar, the essentials more than suffice. What makes it truly stand out is that this machine consistently delivers what matters most—quality ice, fast.

My ex hacked my phone after we broke up, he changed my mom's contact to a bunch of weird things.  Ex. Spawn point, her full maiden name, fuck you (my name) then back to mom.  My phone also did a lot of weird things like scrolling on its own, not letting me press buttons, pics coming out very odd and my data usage spiked. It stopped after I changed my email password so I assume he had my password somehow or decided to stop.  Also he studies cyber security.  He continued to stalk my socials afterwards and is now blocked on everything.  This started over a year ago.  I was looking at all my blocked numbers and found these messages that I never sent.  It says its from AT&T, in the message it says it from VZW which I assume is Verizon wireless.  Neither of which is my phone service. I also looked into it and none of them are affiliated with each other.  I NEVER sent these messages.  The ""I'm sorry I understand"" was the last message my ex sent me before I blocked his number.  It then resends the message months later.  I then unblocked his number to tell him to stop stalking my socials and reblocked him.  There is no messages from AT&T when I did that. The ""which state are you living?"" Was the last text message from a wrong number I blocked not too long ago.  It was obviously a scam, they offered to buy me coffee for inconveniencing me.  I've blocked many other numbers on this phone before and their messages are not in there.  I am just SO confused.  The dates are also off.

1kws1lt,https://www.reddit.com/r/TransRepressors/comments/1kws1lt/lets_be_free_from_agp_part_25_maintenance/,Let's be free from agp (part 2.5): Maintenance,">""What is the maintenance stage""? 

All stages of change require a series of tasks, a stretch of time in which to try them, and a certain amount of energy and dedication. The action stage lasts for several months. 

The first month or two of this period is the most likely time for relapse. No wonder; just a glance back at the previous chapter will recall all the work involved in successful action. 

Maintenance takes all that required work and builds on it. Difficult as it is, forsaking an undesirable behavior is not enough to overcome it for good.

As everyone knows, it's easy to slip back into old problems. Some popular sayings about maintenance—“You're a puff away from a pack a day""; “One drink, one drunk""— acknowledge the difficulties. The difference between the short, intense trip of the action stage and the long haul of maintenance is summarized by the facetious comment many smokers make: “Stopping is easy, I do it every day."" 

Two factors are fundamental to successful maintenance:  sustained, long-term effort, and a revised lifestyle. This is tough work, but nothing else will do. For example, although many diets succeed in the short run, their long-run success rate is quite low. Many dieters lose weight quickly, but six months after beginning a diet, many people weigh more than they did when they started! 

This is action without maintenance. New Year's resolutions also typify this phenomenon. About half of all American adults initiate self-change at the beginning of each new year. It is, after, all a traditional and socially reinforced time for changing behavior. Our research has found that a mere 77 percent of these resolutions are successful for one week. The success rate drops to 55 percent after one month, to 40 percent after six months, and to 19 percent after two years. 

> ""What are the characteristics of maintenance""? 

 Almost all negative habits essentially become our friends—even, in many cases, our lovers. They play important, sometimes dominating roles in our lives.

To overcome them fully, we must replace our problem behaviors with a new, healthier lifestyle. This strategy begins with the action-stage process of countering, but it doesn't end there. That is why the word ""maintenance"" can be misleading. Maintaining behavior change is not like maintaining a home, which often requires little more than a periodic coat of paint. 

We can break old patterns by removing drugs from our lives, for example, or avoiding certain relationships. But those who do no more than remove an old habit condemn themselves to a life of longing and deprivation. Lifelong tolerance of this deprivation requires unceasing and powerful acts of will. The ""dry drunks"" of alcoholic treatment circles, the people who stop smoking but who would return to cigarettes tomorrow if they found out they had cancer may be abstaining but they still run a high risk of relapsing. 

For all of us, former problems, especially addictive ones, will hold some attraction long after the habit is broken. To remain strong throughout maintenance requires that you acknowledge you are still vulnerable to the problem even while you're building a life in which the old behavior has no value. 

In our long-term follow-up of smokers who quit on their own, those who successfully maintained their change through to termination had learned to devalue the positive aspects of smoking; develop confidence in their ability to abstain from smoking; keep a healthy distance from cigarettes; and, through development of new, desirable habits, find few if any temptations to smoke.

>""What keeps people from progressing through maintenance""?


No one who has changed successfully, in or out of therapy, will deny that maintenance is difficult. As with the other stages, there are negative responses that lead to an erosion of commitment and failure. There are also basic strategies for long-term maintenance. Yes, staying there is tough; but it is possible and well worth the effort.

The most common threats to maintenance are social pressures, internal challenges, and special situations. 

Social pressures come from those around you who either engage in the problem behavior themselves, or don't recognize its impact on you. 

Internal challenges usually result from over-confidence and other forms of defective thinking. There are three common internal challenges that are closely related to slips, or brief lapses: **overconfidence, daily temptation, and self-blame**. Each is a mind game, played by people who are subconsciously courting relapse. Awareness of these responses, and vigilance against them, are important in successful maintenance.

A statement such as ""I've got this beat forever"" is a telltale sign of overconfidence. Such self-changers sometimes brush aside the concerns of their friends, insisting, ""I can handle one."" However, the sad truth of addictive problems, borne out by scientific research and clinical experience, is that most people cannot handle ""one"" of any problem product.

Overconfidence can also beget daily temptation, to which you intentionally and unnecessarily subject yourself regularly. Overconfident alcoholics keep a bottle of booze in their desk drawer, to ""remind"" themselves. Ex-smokers stash a pack or two at home to ""test willpower."" Dieters buy high-calorie goodies ""just in case company drops in."" Intentionally exposing yourself to substances or situations you are trying to avoid is not a sign of strength, a measure of willpower, or a positive reminder. Sooner or later temptation wins and you lose. We have yet to meet a self-changer who played the daily temptation game early in maintenance and won. 

Beyond overconfidence and daily temptation is the final pitfall, self-blame. In several studies, including our own, the severity of misplaced self-blame is one of the best predictors of failed maintenance. Ironically, occasional and appropriate self-blame may actually rekindle your commitment to change. Frequent, inappropriate self-blame backfires. Far from being the motivator or activator it is held to be, self-blame is demoralizing and it stymies commitment.

Special situations arise when you are confronted by an unusual, intense temptation. It is difficult to prepare for the extreme, the accidental, and the unexpected.

>""How does one progress through the maintenance stage""? 

As you move through the maintenance stage, you won't need to use the processes of change quite as much as you did during contemplation, preparation, or action. In a very real way, maintenance refers not only to maintaining change but also to maintaining the use of the change processes.

**Honour past efforts and remain vigilant**

You must keep up your commitment. Challenges make it not only easy but natural to let your guard down. The erosion of commitment is subtle. Since threats to maintenance occur infrequently (unlike threats during action, which occur almost constantly), complacency can easily take hold. Humans have the ability to forget painful passages in their lives. Usually, this is a blessing, but selective memory is detrimental to maintaining change. 

If you forget the tremendous effort it took to change, everything begins to look easier than it was and all arguments against indulging ""just for the weekend"" fail. Why not taste a little of that forbidden fruit, when you can change right back again on Monday? 

Many people find success difficult to accept, and their tendency to attribute success to others—God, a spouse, a therapist—challenges their commitment. Giving credit to others is admirable to a degree, but it has its dangers. By not accepting responsibility and credit for liberating yourself, you undermine your self-confidence, your self-esteem, and your commitment. If you think others are responsible for your success, how can you maintain it yourself? 

Self-changers often don't give themselves credit because they don't know just what they did to change. Many people we have interviewed first tell us, ""I just woke up one morning and quit."" When we ask more detailed questions, they begin to remember. They remember the weeks prior to that fateful morning, when perhaps they switched brands and became increasingly disgusted with smoking. They remember earlier attempts to quit smoking. They remember when they avoided people and the places that were filled with smoke during the two weeks after quitting. They remember enlisting the aid of several friends at work by announcing their attempts to quit smoking. Remembering your own efforts to change will reinforce your commitment. Change is often associated with a new way of life.

How, then, can you maintain your commitment? First, jot down the difficulties you encountered in your early change efforts. Review the list you made from months ago of the negative aspects of your problem behavior. Keep both lists in a safe place, look at them periodically, and refer to them at the first sign of slipping. During the maintenance stage, they can act as psychic booster shots. 

Second, take credit for your accomplishment. Maintenance is not the time for criticizing yourself for having had problems, but for taking both credit and responsibility for change. Use the new year, your birthday, or the anniversary of your change (it need not be a year—celebrate a month!) to reflect on the success you have had and to renew your commitment. 

Renewing your commitment is especially important when you are trying to modify regularly occurring behaviors. Maintaining weight loss is a constant issue for people with weight problems, and requires frequent boosts of commitment. Similarly, timidity and passivity in interpersonal relationships require that you make special efforts with a variety of people. With these problems and many others, redoubling commitment is a critical part of maintaining change.

**Keep a healthy distance** 

In maintenance as in action, commitment is not enough; environment control remains a necessary ingredient for success. As you progress through the months of maintenance, you will find your self-confidence increasing and temptation decreasing. Gradually, you will be comfortable in the presence of certain temptations or situations. But you may not become completely immune to them. Too many times, situations arise that can trigger a relapse.
 
Especially during the early months of maintenance, it's best to continue to avoid people, places, or things that could seriously compromise your change. Hanging out at a bar in order to be close to a group of friends may maintain friendships but endangers your sobriety. Staying ""friends"" with your former spouse may feel familiar, but it can threaten your independence. And stopping at the bakery because your kids are coming over for dinner is a generous but ultimately self-defeating gesture. Controlling your environment never signifies weakness but, rather, intelligence, health, and foresight.

**Create a new lifestyle** 

In maintenance as in action, countering is an important partner to environment control. Since stress often triggers problems, from weight gain to marital discord, it is invaluable to develop ways to cope with stress. Chief among stress-reduction techniques, as always, are exercise and relaxation. 

Working to create alternative behaviors is one of the most important and rewarding challenges of maintenance. Individuals with drinking problems, for example, are frequently amazed at the number of activities open to them that do not revolve around alcohol. Make time for something that you've always wanted to do, and you will find you like yourself more and more.

**Check your thinking**

What you think and say to yourself has profound effects on your behavior; negative thinking can pose serious problems. Your attitudes toward a problem remain as important in the maintenance stage as your ability to deal with that problem, the quality of your life without it, and the consequences of possible relapse. 

When you moved from precontemplation and contemplation to preparation and action, the positive aspects of changing became more prominent, and the negative aspects began to dwindle. If you are in the midst of a major change, no doubt you remember how your pros and cons charts changed as you drew closer and closer to action. Health matters, family pressures, and personal concerns all contribute to a decision to take action. Eventually the positives clearly outweigh the negatives. 

Problems may now seem far away and less threatening as you move into the maintenance stage. Being at this distance now may lead you to minimize the dangers and risks of your unwanted behavior, and maximize its appeal. 

Again, the process of forgetting is involved. You may tell yourself that your drinking wasn't that bad; that smoking is better than gaining weight; that the difficulties your shyness created were never major. Denial, distortion, and rationalization are the enemies of maintenance. 

To prevent these negative thoughts from gaining a solid foothold, check your thinking periodically to see if you are being consistent and honest with yourself. Review your reasons for changing. Ask one of your helpers to remind you just how serious your problem was. Go back to the pros and cons exercise. Be honest with yourself. When it comes to your problem, you are as capable of distorting the truth as anyone. The smarter you are, the better you are at rationalizing.

**Guarding against slips**

The goal of maintenance is nothing short of a permanent change that becomes part of your personality. Permanent change is a high ideal, rarely attained without false starts or mistakes. Most people slip along the way—go off their diets, fail to be assertive with a boss or lover, or take a drink. How do you keep these momentary slips from turning into major relapses? 

Slips are usually the result of overwhelming stress or insufficient coping skills. Although slips are far from admirable, you can recover from them, learn from them, and continue toward your goal of permanent change. First, you must take responsibility for your slips and realize that they indicate vulnerability. Check high-risk situations and develop a plan of attack against them. Then you must combat the absolutist thinking that equates a single lapse with total relapse.

When we work with people who have given up drugs or alcohol, we encourage them to go through a mourning process. To maintain abstinence, it's important that they say good-bye to their old friend and trusted companion. Yes, alcohol causes broken marriages, DWI arrests, lost jobs, but for many alcohol is a constant companion and sturdy crutch over the years. 

Regardless of your problem behavior, regardless of your level of disgust when you enter the action stage, don't be surprised if you wake up one day missing your old habits.  Don't think, however, that this means you cannot live without your old behavior; you are in the process of making a new self that does not need your old problems.

**Helpful relationships during maintenance**

People around you are often extremely supportive while you are in the action stage. Soon they take your change for granted. One person who recently kicked his habit complained to me: ""I wish they would keep up the congratulations for as long as they kept giving me grief about my drug use. How soon they forget!"" 

It is more important than ever to have an understanding person nearby during maintenance, especially when you are experiencing a crisis that could lead to a relapse. There are many ways in which you can help your helpers to be supportive during maintenance: 

**Revise your contract**

Expand your initial contract with your helpers. Give them the permission and even the responsibility to confront you if you start reverting to old behavior or express overconfidence and expose yourself repeatedly to tempting situations. 

**Put your helper on call**

Make a ""crisis card"" to put in your wallet or pocketbook. On this card write a list of the negative aspects of your problem, as well as a set of instructions to follow when you are seriously tempted to slip. The instructions could read like this: 

1. Review the problem list. 

2. Substitute positive thinking for negative statements. 

3. Remember the benefits of changing. 

4. Engage in vigorous distraction or exercise.

5. Call [support person's name and number].

**Help someone else** 

Although it may seem contrary to getting support for yourself, many people report that helping others is a key to helping themselves maintain change. The psychiatrist Karl Menninger liked to say, ""Love cures people—both the ones who give it and the ones who receive it."" It is a refreshing, esteem-boosting experience to discover that you can not only help yourself but others too.

**Patience and persistence** 

Many behaviors that we wish to change become problems because of our tendency to take a short-term perspective. We have become accustomed to the instant fix: fast food, instant coffee, quick pleasures. We can no longer wait for gratification. 

But short-term ecstasies—eating, drinking, or taking drugs—create long-term agonies. And a short-term perspective is counterproductive during the maintenance stage, where there is no such thing as a quick fix. Difficult as it may be, a shift in perspective can help you transform your life. 

Patience and persistence are the hallmarks of maintenance. Time can be an ally as you progress across the stages of change. One comforting thought, as you struggle with maintenance, is that the process is a lengthy one. You don't have to get everything right all at once. Recalling how long you spent in the precontemplation and contemplation stages can provide an important reality check. However long it takes to change, consider how many years you may be adding to your life, and how improved the quality of that life will be in the years to come.

**Assertiveness**

Problem behaviors can be expected, supported, and triggered by other people in your life as well as by internal forces. Self-changers sometimes feel despondent and helpless in the face of external pressures to maintain their problem behaviors. However, by being assertive, you are exercising your right to communicate your thoughts, feelings, wishes, and intentions clearly, thereby countering feelings of helplessness. 

Unlike exercise and deep relaxation, assertiveness is not an activity that must be scheduled. It is a technique that you can use whenever you feel you are not being heard or respected. The benefits of exercising your right to be heard, and to change, are: 

• Decreased anxiety, anger, and neuroses

• Increased self-respect, communication, and leadership abilities 

• Increased satisfaction in all personal relationships 

Most people can be assertive, but many become inhibited because they do not believe they have the right to be powerful. You may not realize that you have all of the following rights, and may be depriving yourself by not acting upon them: 

• The right to be heard 

• The right to influence other people 

• The right to make mistakes, (with respect to the harm they may cause)

• The right to bring attention to yourself

• The right to change your mind

• The right to judge your own thoughts and feelings, (whether they are appropriate, proportional, etc)

• The right to resist other people's judgments 

• The right not to have to justify yourself, (provided you aren't causing harm to others). 

• The right to have limits—limited knowledge, limited caring, limited responsibility for others, and limited time 

• The right to have your limits respected 

When you accept and act upon these rights, you are more likely to be assertive. And when you acknowledge that all people have the same rights as you, you will not confuse assertion with aggression. If nonassertive, passive behavior says that ""you count, but I don't,"" and aggressive behavior says that ""I count, and you don't,"" assertiveness respectfully communicates that ""I count just as you do."" These are extremely important but frequently overlooked distinctions. **Assertion does not accomplish goals at the expense of another person, as aggression does, nor does it deny your own rights, as does passivity. Rather, assertiveness grants all parties their rights**. 

Whenever your response is more assertive than a situation warrants, it will probably be experienced as aggression, and it will generate counteraggression rather than compliance. If you are unsure whether your action is assertive or aggressive, (besides taking the time to consider the input of the other person in light of the situation and their past behaviour), complete the following mental checklist: 

• Did I express my rights? 

• Did I respect his or her rights? 

• Was I specific about a behavior change?

Affirmative responses to these questions means that you were being assertive rather than aggressive. Of course, **assertion doesn't guarantee that other people will honor your feelings or requests. What effective assertiveness does assure is that others will have an opportunity to understand your objectives, and hence you will have increased your chances of meeting them. If you don't make it clear how you want others to help you change, this pretty much guarantees that they won't do it.**

Also relevant to this: 

**An emotional reaction is a function of a (perception of a) change caused by an action and an internal state**. Anyone can be uncomfortable for the most stupidly benign things, they can even be uncomfortable or threatened in response to something that is good for them or others. 

**You aren't responsible for the feelings of others and they aren't responsible for your feelings**. If you understand the above paragraph you should already be grasping this one, to be entirely responsible for the emotions of someone you would have to have control not only over your own behaviour, but their entire past experiences and the belief network they produced, as well as access to literally their mind and metacognitive abilities, since they are ones that are at the receiving end of whatever emotional signal was generated. It is absurd to believe that you have such control and it therefore doesn't make sense to hold you responsible for it, it is their job to manage their emotions. 

So focus on behaviour, actions. You are responsible for your actions and their effects and so are they for theirs. ""It makes me feel uncomfortable"" is a request whose aim is hopefully symbiosis and understanding, but it isn't, I repeat, it isn't a valid reason to step over someone's rights. 

It is almost probabilistically speaking certain, that someone, some day, will try to exploit you based on that lack of understanding. Try to take away your rights, or to absolve themselves of the responsibility inherit in their actions. **Don't fall for it.**

You will also see actual victims of abuse evoke their feelings being hurt, in their fight for either equality or revenge. It's still a poor excuse for taking away rights, it's still bad, poorly thought out, rules of interaction, that leave wide open the doors for violence. And bad actors will in time exploit with delight this permissibility at the cost of everyone's eroded well being long term. So the rule remains, judge based on actions here too, you do not need to, neither is it desirable, to weaken this rule. 

**Environmental control**

You can do all the countering in the world, but if you go out to a bar every night, you will not be able to control your drinking; if you head to a fancy restaurant when you get hungry, you will fail in your attempts to control your eating; if you say yes to every new project at the office, it will be difficult to avoid overworking. Unlike countering, which involves changing one's responses to a given situation, environment control involves changing the situation itself. Both are necessary for successful change.

Earlier in the twentieth century, behavioral psychologists demonstrated that much of our behavior depends upon our surroundings. Most of us, for example, are more on edge in noisy environments than in quiet ones, and more distressed when alone than when in the presence of supportive people. Behaviorists also discovered that to a considerable extent we can change our environment to control behavior, making and unmaking it so as to fit our needs and desires. 

**Environmental change involves restructuring your environment so that the likely occurrence of a problematic stimulus is significantly reduced**. The changes can be quite simple, complexity or cost doesn't matter, effectiveness does. Here are some control techniques:

**Avoidance**

Many people believe that they must rely on willpower alone to resist temptation. However, avoidance, because it helps eliminate temptation, is a key technique of the control process. Avoidance is not a sign of weakness or poor self- control; in fact, effective self-control includes the ability to prevent a problem from starting. 

Avoiding avoidance is foolhardy and dangerous. We have heard many unsuccessful changers say, ""I need to have alcohol around for company,"" or ""I need to have junk food around for the kids,"" or ""I hate to throw a whole carton of cigarettes away."" Such statements are self-defeating. If you are quitting drinking, it makes sense to avoid keeping liquor in the house. Smokers are equally smart to remove cigarettes or ashtrays from their homes, and overeaters to get rid of fattening foods. 

Avoidance needn't be limited to objects. If you are 
an adult and your parents upset you, you may feel justified in avoiding them for a time. If being inactive depresses you, don't lie on the couch watching television. If going to rock concerts causes you to hanker for drugs, steer clear of those stressful situations.

**Cues**

Avoidance is not a permanent solution; eventually you will experience the cues that trigger your problem behavior. 

To prepare yourself to meet the challenge, you must gradually expose yourself to those cues as you progress through the action stage. Practicing cue exposure without responding in self-defeating ways will gradually increase your resistance. 

Many successful self-changers have found that it helps to first confront problem cues in their imagination. For example, if your parents are a source of distress, imagine that you are visiting them, and the first thing they do is criticize you for avoiding them. Visualize yourself breathing deeply, relaxing, and saying, ""I understand why you're upset, but I've needed more time to myself lately."" Plan how long you are going to remain with them, under what conditions you will leave, and how you will continue to counter troubling cues. 
As you successfully imagine your effective responses to problem cues, you will become better prepared to deal with problematic situations when you Confront them in real life. 
It's a good thing, too—sooner or later you may want to visit your parents, attend a cocktail party, dine out on a special occasion ... in short, engage in activities that have historically cued your problem behavior. But you will already have taken the necessary steps to counter whatever situation arises.

**Reminders**

Everyone uses clocks and calendars to help control their behavior. These simple tools remind us of how we are to respond next—when it's time to eat, go to work, take a break, or leave for vacation. We take these cues for granted; we find it natural to control our lives by reminders. 

Reminders are equally important for people who are in the action stage. Put no smoking signs in your office, stop signs on your refrigerator door, or relax signs by the phone. These reminders may seem artificial and unnatural, but they are like stop signs at busy intersections, useful for controlling behavior. 

One of the best reminders is a ""To Do List."" Usually it's a numbered list of tasks to do but adding action goals is a natural extension. For example if you are working to reduce anxiety, add: 

1. Relax 

2. Exercise 

3. Counter thoughts 

You can also use the list to reinforce yourself by scratching off the positive techniques you used during the day; checking something off a list is one of life's little pleasures.

**Reward** 

Environment control modifies the cues that precede and trigger problem behavior; reward modifies the consequences that follow and reinforce it. Historically, rewards have been used to reinforce desirable behaviors, and punishments to discourage undesirable ones. Since even the most ardent behavioral psychologists now believe that punishment tends only to suppress troubled behavior temporarily, we will concentrate on rewards.

We have met many unfortunate self-changers who argue that they should not reward themselves for changing problems, because they should not have been abusing alcohol, food, or tobacco in the first place. By failing to reinforce their positive self-change efforts, they are essentially punishing themselves. This is a mistake. 

Reward would be unnecessary if resisting temptation were its own reward. If it felt good to decline fattening foods or avoid cocktails, self-change would require little effort.  We need to be reinforced when we substitute carrots for chocolate, jogging for cigarettes, relaxation for anger, assertiveness for fear. Successful but naive self-changers have learned the benefits of reward: They praise themselves for not getting angry, they buy themselves new outfits with the money saved from quitting smoking, they seek family recognition for losing weight. There are three invaluable techniques for rewarding positive behavior:

**Covert management**

No matter what behavior you are changing, when cues arise, breathe deeply, tell yourself to be calm, and immediately follow your relaxation response with a private word of congratulations: ""Nice job of relaxing,"" or ""It feels good to be in control,"" or simply, ""Way to go."" These healthy self-administered pats on the back are examples of covert management. 

If after relaxing or asserting yourself, you immediately begin to feel upset for not indulging your behavior, you are effectively punishing your resistance to temptation. Over time this will weaken your resistance and increase your risk of relapse. Substituting alternatives are self-change exercises that should be rewarded.

Suppose you slip and give in to temptation. Should you berate yourself? We think not. Although punishing yourself for slips may temporarily suppress undesired behavior, it does not alter it in the long run, because it does not offer suitable alternatives. Calling yourself a fool the morning after you drink is too long after the fact to be effective. 

Besides, you have already rewarded your slip by having a couple of favorite drinks. The same goes for overeating: If you say, ""I shouldn't have eaten the whole thing,"" it's not only too late, but you have already reinforced yourself by eating the whole thing (and probably enjoying it). If delayed punishments worked, then hangovers and bellyaches would be natural cures for overindulgence. 

Furthermore, covert punishments decrease self-esteem and increase emotional distress. Both of these are barriers to the change process. At this time, you need to believe in yourself, you need to be patient and calm; getting angry at yourself does no good. 

When you correctly reinforce yourself, your self-statements will sound like echoes of positive role models from your past. Private kudos like ""Nice going, pal,"" or ""Good work"" make you feel as though you are ""reparenting"" yourself to learn more mature behavior. Self-reinforcements such as ""You can handle it,"" or ""Don't give up; you can do it"" are reminiscent of teachers or coaches who encouraged you to do your best and to feel good about yourself in the process. 

If you had too much negative parenting, teaching, or coaching in the past, all the more reason to reinforce yourself in the present. Remember, you are in the process of changing your self-image and self-esteem, not just specific behaviors. It is important to feel good about the entire process of change, not just the planned outcome.

**Contracting** 

Contracting, whether formal or informal, is used during the action stage. One teenage boy bets another one $10 that he's going to ask a girl out whom he likes, in order to pressure himself into it. A wealthy father promises his overweight teenage daughter that he will put $100 in an account for every pound she loses; if she loses twenty pounds, she will have enough to buy the horse she has always wanted. Some insurance companies offer $100 discounts to teenagers who make the honor roll; others grant $100 rebates to customers who quit smoking. With a fair contract, both parties gain from desirable changes. 

Not everyone has an individual or company who is willing to contract for a change in problem behaviors, but anyone can make a contract with himself or herself. Written contracts tend to be more powerful than spoken ones, so write out your agreement. For example: ""For every pound I lose I agree to put $10 [or whatever you can afford] into a shopping account."" Whenever you need reinforcement, you can draw on your account and reimburse yourself. 

It is important to remember the dual objectives here. You want to reinforce yourself for not engaging in problem behavior, and also reward yourself for substituting a healthier alternative. Consider adding another sentence to the contract in the last paragraph: ""I will also deposit $5 for every 30 minutes I spend exercising."" It is often easier to promote a new behavior than to eliminate an old one, and, as we have seen, countering is key to self-change.

**Shaping up** 

Overcoming problems requires that you gradually shape your behavior in a new, desirable direction. A person can't overcome agoraphobia, for example, all at once. Using willpower to plan a vacation may be well intentioned, but panic reactions at the first bend in the road, or even the first step over the threshold can drive the agoraphobic back to the security of home. Setting yourself an immediate goal that is ambitious but unreasonable virtually guarantees failure. 

A step-by-step approach, with reinforcement following each successive movement, is much more likely to be successful. A phobic person might begin by walking to the end of the block; the next step might be to walk part of the way around the block. Each step takes the person farther from the safety of home, each step is reinforced, and any feelings of anxiety are countered with relaxation. The first step on your own personal path may seem simple and unworthy of being rewarded, and many people withhold rewards until they make more visible progress toward their goals. But the more difficult steps of the action stage must be built on a solid, well-reinforced foundation. 

When you slip (and most of us do), you want to ensure that you don't fall all the way. Well-practiced, well-rewarded earlier steps are good insurance that any slips will be brief lapses rather than complete relapses. Overcoming a problem is hard enough without depriving yourself of well-deserved reinforcements along the way.

**Helpful relationships during action**

Action is the busiest period of change. Now more than ever, you need to depend on your helping relationships. Think of your problem as an old piano that needs to be carried down a flight of stairs. Use the same strategy here and let several people help you to bear your problem away. 

Don't assume that your spouse or anyone else will intuit your plans; go public and do it clearly. Remember, too, that change is a life-saving operation; let people know that even if you become anxious, irritable, confused, and difficult, you want and need their support.

Exercise together, buddy up, make agreements to rearrange your home. Motivate your helpers, verbal praise, monetary rewards, extra hugs, small presents, back massages, and the like are all useful rewards. 

**Keep it positive**

Scolding, nagging, preaching, and embarrassing are not forms of support. Write in your contract that helpers should not use these ""methods,"" even if they are well intentioned, because they increase distress and eventually backfire on the helper. So don't get guilt tripped. 

Many family members are mute supporters for seven consecutive days of progress, but become vocal critics the one day you slip. Tell them at the start that reinforcement is superior to punishment in behavior change, and ask them to monitor the ratio of their positive to negative comments; we recommend at least three compliments for every criticism. 

**Seek support for life**

If you are short on significant others, or if family and/or friends cannot give you the support you need, find a local support group. People who are struggling with the same problems can reinforce you, guide you through the rough spots, and remind you of the benefits of changing. 

Group support need not come from formal organizations. One of the most successful support groups I've ever known involved seven women who worked in the same office. 

They met twice a week to share their dieting concerns. They ate a low-calorie lunch together on Tuesdays, and coffee (no doughnuts) on Friday mornings. Successful as they were, they resented being called a ""group""; they were, they said, ""just a bunch of women talking."" Whatever the source of your helping relationships, they are of vital importance during the action stage, and will remain extremely potent as you transform your short-term changes into long-term revisions during the maintenance stage.

## Key Features Analysis

The unique appeal of giant candles lies in their sheer size and extended burn times. However, several critical features directly impact performance and overall value.

**Wax Type and Composition:** Different wax types, such as paraffin, soy, beeswax, and blends, significantly influence burn quality, scent throw, and environmental impact. Paraffin wax, derived from petroleum, is frequently enough the cheapest option but can produce soot and release possibly harmful chemicals. Soy wax, made from soybeans, is a renewable resource that burns cleaner and longer than paraffin. Beeswax, a natural wax produced by bees, is known for its clean burn and subtle honey scent.Blends combine various waxes to optimize specific characteristics like scent throw or burn time. The composition and quality of the wax are paramount in determining candle performance and safety.

**Wick Material and Configuration:** The wick serves as the conduit for fuel, delivering melted wax to the flame.Wick material, typically cotton or wood, must be appropriately sized and configured to ensure a consistent and complete burn. Multiple wicks may be used in giant candles to distribute heat evenly and prevent tunneling (where the candle burns down the center, leaving wax along the edges). The proper wick choice translates to efficient fuel consumption, minimal soot production, and optimal scent diffusion.

**Scent Load and Fragrance Oils:** the scent load refers to the percentage of fragrance oils incorporated into the wax. A higher scent load generally results in a stronger scent throw, but it can also affect the burning characteristics and potentially lead to pooling (excessive melted wax) or uneven burning. The quality of fragrance oils is also crucial. Natural essential oils often provide more nuanced and complex aromas compared to synthetic fragrances, which can sometimes smell artificial or overpowering. A well-balanced scent load with high-quality fragrance oils creates a pleasant and consistent scent experience without compromising burn performance.

**Container Material and Design:** Giant candles require sturdy and heat-resistant containers to safely contain the large volume of wax. Common materials include glass, ceramic, and metal.The container's design affects both aesthetics and functionality. Wide-mouthed containers can promote even burning, while narrow containers may restrict airflow and lead to tunneling. A well-designed container should complement the candle's overall aesthetic and provide a safe and stable base.

**Burn Time and Maintenance:** Giant candles are prized for their extended burn times, which can range from several days to several weeks.However, achieving the advertised burn time depends on several factors, including wax type, wick configuration, and proper maintenance. Regular trimming of the wick (to about ¼ inch) prevents excessive smoking and soot buildup. Avoiding drafts and burning the candle for appropriate intervals (typically 3-4 hours at a time) also promotes even burning and extends its lifespan.

## Core Benefits

The allure of giant candles extends beyond their visual appeal and encompasses several tangible benefits that resonate with consumers.

**Extended Ambiance and Fragrance:** Giant candles provide hours, and sometimes days, of continuous ambiance and fragrance. This eliminates the need for frequent replacements, making them a cost-effective solution for creating a consistent and inviting atmosphere in large spaces. For example, a single giant candle can perfume an entire living room for several weeks, offering a continuous stream of aromatherapy without requiring constant attention.

**Statement Decor Piece:** Beyond their functional purpose, giant candles serve as eye-catching decor pieces that elevate the aesthetic of any room. Their imposing size and visual presence create a sense of luxury and sophistication. For instance, a large pillar candle placed on a fireplace mantel or coffee table instantly becomes a focal point, adding depth and character to the space.

**Reduced Replacement Frequency:** Unlike smaller candles, which require frequent replacements, giant candles offer a longer-lasting solution. This reduces the hassle and expense associated with constantly purchasing new candles.This is especially useful if a buyer is looking to set the ambience with lighting but does not want to constantly relight and replace the candle lighting it.

**Improved Air Quality (with Natural Waxes):** Candles made with natural waxes, such as soy or beeswax, burn cleaner than those made with paraffin, resulting in improved indoor air quality. These waxes release fewer toxins and allergens, making them a healthier choice for individuals with sensitivities or allergies.For example,a soy wax giant candle can provide hours of fragrance without contributing to indoor air pollution or triggering respiratory issues.

## FAQs Section

Addressing common consumer questions is crucial when considering a purchase as meaningful as a giant candle.**How can I prevent tunneling in a giant candle?**

Tunneling, where a candle burns down the center leaving wax on the edges, is a common issue with larger candles. To prevent it, ensure the initial burn creates a full melt pool across the entire surface. This may require burning the candle for several hours during the first use. Also, avoid burning the candle for short periods; aim for 3-4 hour intervals to maintain an even burn. If tunneling occurs, you can attempt to correct it by wrapping the base of the candle with foil to reflect heat inward and melt the remaining wax.**What is the ideal environment for burning a giant candle?**

the ideal environment is one free from drafts and excessive movement. Drafts can cause uneven burning, smoking, and shortened burn times. Place the candle on a stable, heat-resistant surface away from flammable materials. avoid burning candles near open windows or air vents.Maintain a safe distance from curtains, furniture, and other potentially combustible items.

**Are all fragrance oils safe to burn?**

No, not all fragrance oils are created equal. Some fragrance oils contain phthalates and other potentially harmful chemicals that can be released into the air when burned. Look for candles that use natural essential oils or high-quality synthetic fragrances that are phthalate-free and undergo rigorous testing for safety and purity. Check the product label or contact the manufacturer for detailed facts about the fragrance oil composition.

**How often should I trim the wick of a giant candle?**

Regular wick trimming is essential for optimal candle performance and safety. Trim the wick to about ¼ inch before each burn using a wick trimmer or scissors. This prevents excessive smoking, soot buildup, and mushrooming (the formation of a carbon ball on the wick). Trimming the wick also helps to maintain a consistent flame and even burn.

hi all. i’ve been in a depression for a bout 3 weeks now. i recently lost my job due to the company shutting down due to shady business ventures. that’s about all i can say. i was making pretty decent money, and on my way to being able to afford my own place again. ( I’m 29F and have been staying at my moms since january this year, and was hoping to move out by June/July)
anyways. due to the way the company ended the employees (all of us were friends and would hang out outside of work) were split and this led to back n forths and just complete losses of friendships all together. 
on top of that, i’ve been working little odd jobs here and there when i can (shout out Instawork) and trying to stay productive but it’s like i can’t
ever since i lost my job it’s like it takes everything in me just to make a cup of coffee or pick my clothes up off the floor. I feel pathetic just writing that but it’s true. Sometimes my boyfriend comes over just to cook and clean for me or “take me on a walk” like im some old person who can’t take care of themselves. I feel so embarrassed by this even though im so grateful for him.  Even with the support of my partner and mom I know deep down that the only one who’s going to break me out of this funk is me. I know I want better for myself it just feels impossible. 
I don’t want to be depressed anymore. I don’t want to eat Mcdonald’s 3 days in a row or have a whole bottle of wine to myself. 
I’ve deleted my instagram cause all I’ve been doing is watching other people I know thrive and travel and enjoy their lives, while I feel like I’m wasting away. There are times when I question why I’m even alive or questioning if i even have a purpose.
I don’t want this to be any longer than it already is, my whole point in writing this was to ask for advice if anyone has any. 
What are some ways you have pulled yourself out of a dark place? What are ways to be productive and move forward during times of depression?

1kwrrgb,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1kwrrgb,"If you are frustrated with Pokemon Sleep, it’s not your fault!","If you feel frustrated, it’s not your fault. 

The game is designed to give you lots of rewards and dopamine hits until you reach level 30 about 60 days in. 

It is designed that way for a reason, most addictions take 60 days to take hold. That includes coffee or smoking or other addictions. For 60 days your brain has getting dopamine hits from Pokemon Sleep, and now after you’re hooked , it’s suddenly so much harder after day 60 to make progress. 

In 60 days , you can 3 unlock islands, you get all the easy rewards of being a new player, you more easily find new Pokemon and new sleep styles. You have lots of poke cookies.

Then you hit a plateau, and suddenly rewards are more scarce. Progress is happening much slower. The dopamine hits are not happening as often, so you feel frustrated.

Once you’re frustrated and looking for that dopamine rush, you are more likely to:

* Buy premium to “fix” the problem.
* Buy the $50+ device thinking it’ll improve performance.
* Stick around longer thinking “it’ll get better”

The pain you’re experiencing—slowed progress despite stronger Pokémon—is not a glitch.

It’s calculated frustration.

This is the unfortunate nature of mobile games with subscriptions. They don’t get to thrive in the Nintendo ecosystem, so they have to put pressure on players to get money to pay their developers a living wage.

So if you are struggling, it’s not you or your fault.

The game is designed to be this way. It’s designed to be greedy. 

 I hope these graphs help you visualize what progress is like in this game, and how to manage your expectations.

1kwrqxk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Life/comments/1kwrqxk/advice_on_art_and_avoiding_the_solitudea_student/,Advice on art and avoiding the solitude??--A Student,"I have a big question. Actually, I'm not sure that I have one \*specific\* question, but I am so in need of perspective. Short summary / question below. 

 I am 19--just finished my first year of uni (Interdisciplinary Studies in Art) and have decided to switch schools and programs. Pretext: last year I applied to \*one\* school, one that wasn't my fave, but did the trick. For many reasons, the last year and a half of my life have been very difficult, and I think my rung-dry state of mind has informed a lot of my decision making, hence the anticlimactic uni application. 

At heart I really am a creative. All I want to do is connect with the world around me. Unfortunately, I also have to make enough money to sustain myself, and ideally support others. Last year I tossed aside the idea of art school (vis, film, lit ? ) because I have a consuming fear that I will fuck up a career in the arts, worse that I will not be fulfilled, and worst of all that my decision to do art is letting down the human race and that I should be a teacher or a social worker or some sort of something that directly nurtures life and fulfillment in others. The latter is my ultimate goal. 

I need to decide what to do for school. Humanities? Is that useless?? So many people seem to say that a humanities degree will land me in a coffee shop. Do I pursue arts? Is that utterly selfish? Do I even... is that... what??

Here's what I know. I believe everyone has \*something to say\*--I think we all have something deep down that we feel needs to be understood and realized. I think that's a pretty common idea? Anyways, this might come across melodramatic, but I have always been intensely aware of my Something To Say, although I don't know exactly what shape it's in. 

I am terrified I will never say it, if that makes sense? 

I will be moving to Montreal this fall, I will be working (tips on finding jobs in the arts??), and I am, to a devastating degree, a perfectionist. 

TL/DR

Advice on making decisions? How do I balance making money with being fulfilled? Anyone relating? Any Artists out there? How much does my degree matter in all of this?

Una plataforma que contiene herramientas muy útiles para aquellos salvadoreños que quieran comprender mejor los cálculos de las **finanzas, préstamos y rentas** dentro de el territorio salvadoreño. No requiere creación de cuenta y puede ser usado en cualquier dispositivo.

[https://resumint.io/](https://resumint.io/)

Una herramienta en línea especializada para crear un **mejor currículum** y ser usado en las Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS). Utiliza formatos profesionales para ofrecer una mejor calidad y optimización en los sistemas de escaneo que usan las empresas para filtrar posibles candidatos. No requiere creación de cuenta.

Según indica la plataforma, ""La mayoría de los trabajadores no cuentan con un espacio seguro para compartir sus ideas y vivencias laborales sin miedo a represalias."" No se necesita cuenta para leer las reseñas, pero si requiere la creación de una para analizar detalles extra y publicar reseñas.

1kwroka,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskIndia/comments/1kwroka/taking_care_of_old_parents/,Taking care of old parents,"Ok so what I'm about to say may be controversial so please don’t come at me!

So i have seen my parents, relatives, and in-laws all take care of their elderly parents right? Some elders live with their children, some are in old age homes, and some (like my husband’s grandparents) live alone in their own house. In India, while most people don’t leave their parents alone some do send them to old age homes. There's always this debate on should we keep our parents with us or let them live separately either alone or in a old age home?

I want to talk about the side that often gets judged which is the decision to let the parents live on their own or in an old age home.

Let me share some of the incidents i have seen in my life for a clearer picture. My grandparents are very traditional and strongly rooted in old beliefs. They are super adamant about certain thingsm like on certain days, they'll only eat vegetarian which is fine. But the problem is they expect everyone in the family to do the same. They're very God fearing and follow strict pujas and religious customs and they want everyone else to do the same. My parents go to work every day, how can they realistically keep up with all of that? And when they don’t, there are arguments, guilt trips, and comments like, “You are disrespecting us"" or “God will be angry on you.”

One of my relatives (my uncle) ended up sending his mother in an old age home. It was a difficult decision but it came after a lot of emotional and physical strain. She was bedridden due to some lower extremity weakness and although she initially stayed with their family, she constantly kept pestering them. She emanded snacks, coffee (like 3+ times a day), leg massages etc. The one who suffered most was my aunt. She was both physically and mentally exhausted. My uncle’s mother would call her constantly and never let her rest. The worst thing was whenever any guests came to their house, she would lie and say nobody cared for her, that they are not feeding her properly and making her starved. She would insult my aunt to others. My uncle couldn’t take it anymore and moved her to an old age home where she spent her final days.

This really makes me sad and honestly  worried. Why do some parents change so much as they age? I know we’re supposed to care for them until the end, but how are we supposed to do that when things become so toxic or unbearable?

I recently saw a popular debate show (neeya naana) episode about this same topic, and a Muslim woman on the show supported sending parents to an old age home. The amount of hate she received was insane. But if you really think about it, what must have made her say that? People only speak out like that when they have gone through something difficult. It’s not always easy. That's just the truth.

Yes our parents raised us for 20 to 30 years. But did we ever disrespect them? No. In fact, we got scolded or even hit if we talked back. They took all our life decisions including career, marriage, everything. And if you are a girl, let’s be honest freedom is just a dream. Even things like what we wear or where we go are decided by our parents. But now that they are old, suddenly we are the ones who have to be more understanding and more patient? I dont think its fair at all.

I’m genuinely scared how it’ll be with my own parents and with my in-laws too. I want to take care of them. But with the way things are already going (my in-laws are already kind of difficult), I’m not sure how it’s all going to go.

Honestly I didn’t think I’d make it this far when I first quit. I’ve been drinking caffeine since I was a kid. Sodas, sweet tea, coffee. It was so normal I never questioned it.

The first few weeks off were rough. My speech got weird. Tight throat, hard to get words out sometimes. Felt like I had to push to talk. The fatigue hit hard too. I was yawning all day, like my body was finally catching up on years of exhaustion.

But now things are shifting. My workouts feel smoother. I’m breathing easier. There’s a calmness settling in that I haven’t felt in decades. My mind isn’t racing like it used to. I’m starting to trust my timing again. My voice, my body, even my thoughts feel more natural.

One thing I’ve learned the hard way is that not everybody is going to understand. People will try to tempt you to go back. Offer you a soda or a coffee without thinking twice. I realized it’s not always the best idea to tell people what you’re doing, especially in the beginning when you’re struggling. If they’re addicted too they might take it personal or make little comments that mess with your head. Protecting your peace matters.

People don’t realize how much caffeine affects the nervous system. We just accept it as normal. But the truth is a lot of what I thought was me was just overstimulation. Now I’m starting to feel who I really am underneath all that noise.",9,1748363038.0,decaf,3,0.92,False

I thought being a barista just meant pouring coffee and smiling at customers. But I quickly learned that there’s an art—and a science—to making a truly great cup. That’s when I realized I needed something more structured to really grow in this field. Investing in [**barista training**](https://www.baristamasterclass.com.au/) completely changed my perspective—and my career.

# Understanding the Role of a Barista

Being a barista isn’t just about knowing how to push buttons on an espresso machine. It’s about understanding coffee from bean to cup. You’re part artist, part technician, and part customer service expert. The ability to balance all three roles is something that only proper training can really teach you.

Before I took any formal classes, I used to get flustered during the morning rush. I didn’t know why my espresso shots were too sour or too bitter. My latte art was more like latte blobs. But after completing my first barista course, I finally understood the importance of grind size, tamp pressure, milk texture, and extraction time.

# Why I Chose to Enroll in Barista Training

For me, it wasn’t just about landing a better job; I wanted to *master* my craft. There are a lot of online tutorials and YouTube videos out there, but nothing beats hands-on experience guided by professionals. The structure of a training program helped me stay motivated, focused, and, most importantly, consistent.

Good training programs don’t just teach you how to use equipment. They dig deep into:

* Coffee bean origins and flavor profiles
* Milk chemistry and steaming techniques
* Hygiene, workflow, and station management
* Customer engagement and service strategies

And yes—latte art, too. Finally, I could pour a heart without it looking like a squashed mushroom.

# The Immediate Benefits I Noticed

After completing my barista training, I started noticing big changes at work. For one, I could troubleshoot problems on the fly. If a shot pulled too fast, I could identify and fix the issue in seconds. My confidence improved, and so did my tips.

More importantly, I was no longer just following steps—I understood *why* each step mattered. That shift in mindset gave me a stronger sense of pride in what I was doing. My manager noticed the difference too, and before long, I was promoted to lead barista.

# The Long-Term Career Perks

One of the best things about barista training is how it opens doors. Whether you’re looking to work in specialty cafés, travel the world, or eventually start your own coffee business, formal training is a big plus. It shows that you’re serious and knowledgeable—and in a competitive industry, that matters.

I’ve since moved on from my first café job, and each time I applied for a new role, having barista training on my resume gave me an edge. It’s also helped me connect with a community of other coffee professionals, which is great for learning, networking, and even landing new gigs.

# What to Look For in a Good Barista Training Program

Not all programs are created equal. When I was researching where to train, I looked for a few key things:

* **Experienced Instructors:** It’s crucial that the trainers have real-world experience behind the bar.
* **Hands-On Practice:** You want more than lectures—you need to get your hands dirty.
* **Industry-Relevant Curriculum:** Make sure the content reflects current trends and techniques.
* **Accreditation or Certification:** This can boost your credibility with future employers.
* **Post-Training Support:** Look for programs that offer job placement assistance or continued learning options.

If you're just starting out or even if you're already working in a café, investing in barista training is a smart move. It’s more than just learning how to make coffee—it's about becoming a skilled, confident, and respected professional in a thriving industry.

# Final Thoughts

Looking back, I’m so glad I took that first step and enrolled in a formal barista training course. It didn’t just make me better at my job—it made me fall in love with coffee all over again. If you're serious about coffee and want to elevate your skills, don't hesitate. Whether you're eyeing a full-time coffee career or just want to stand out in a crowded job market, this kind of training is worth every cent.",1,1748363035.0,u_Intelligent_Tune_392,0,1.0,False

Every night, the moment she closed her eyes, the dream began—if you could even call it that. A black fog swirled around her, heavy as cement, and out of it slithered the thing: tall and with a thousand blinking eyes and skin like oil – sticky, swirly and black. It never spoke. It didn’t need to. Its silence was louder than anything else.
Charlie would wake up screaming, gasping, clawing at her bedsheets like they might save her. But no one believed her. “Just a nightmare,” her mother whispered, smoothing her damp hair. “It’s not real.”
But it was real. And worse, it was getting stronger.
Soon, Charlie stopped sleeping altogether. At first, she tried staying up with books and flashlights. When that failed, she taped her eyelids open, her skin stinging from the tiredness. Coffee burned her stomach, but she drank it anyway. Every second was survival.
But sleep always won. Naps began to creep in during class. Her hand would jerk awake mid-note, her pen slashing across the paper like a wound. Daydreams turned to hallucinations—seeing the creature's eyes blinking from behind the teacher’s head, its shadow writhing between lockers. Her classmates began to whisper. Her teachers sent notes home. The bags under her eyes turned purple; her fingers trembled constantly.
Then came the breaking point.
One night, half-conscious and delirious, Charlie stared into the mirror and saw the creature staring back. Her own face distorted—eyes too wide, skin too pale, a grin that didn’t belong to her. That night, she stopped fighting. She didn’t sleep, not in the usual way, but something inside her broke open like a cracked egg.
The monster no longer haunted her.
It was her.

Like many, I started my mornings with a quick cup from a machine or a local café without thinking much about what made a great cup truly special. That changed when I decided to enroll in a [**Barista Masterclass**](https://www.baristamasterclass.com.au/). What I learned transformed not only how I make coffee but how I appreciate it.

# Why I Chose to Take a Barista Masterclass

For a long time, I wanted to understand what goes behind the perfect espresso shot or that creamy latte art that looks like a masterpiece. I knew there was more to coffee than just brewing beans with hot water, but I didn’t realize how detailed and skillful the craft was until I took that step to learn.

The Barista Masterclass promised hands-on learning, expert guidance, and insider tips that I couldn’t find online or from casual coffee drinkers. And it delivered — from bean selection and grinding to milk steaming and pulling shots, the experience was immersive and eye-opening.

# What You Can Expect from a Barista Masterclass

A good barista course doesn’t just teach you to operate a coffee machine. It dives deep into:

* **Coffee Bean Knowledge**: Understanding different types of coffee beans, where they come from, and how origin affects flavor.
* **Grinding and Extraction**: Learning how grind size and tamping pressure impact the taste of espresso.
* **Milk Steaming and Frothing**: Mastering texture and temperature for lattes, cappuccinos, and more.
* **Latte Art Basics**: Simple designs to impress friends or customers.
* **Machine Maintenance**: Keeping your espresso machine clean and in top shape.

Each step is crucial to crafting a cup that not only tastes great but feels like a small ritual to savor.

# How the Class Changed My Coffee Game

Before the class, I barely noticed the nuances between different coffees. Now, I can pick up on the subtle fruity notes in a single-origin bean or identify when an espresso shot is under-extracted. Making coffee feels less like a chore and more like an enjoyable art form.

The best part? I can confidently prepare café-quality coffee at home. Whether it’s waking up early to craft a velvety flat white or impressing guests with latte art, the skills I learned are practical and fun to apply every day.

1kwrjfk,https://www.reddit.com/r/flashfiction/comments/1kwrjfk/the_daily_grind/,The Daily Grind,"Jupiter sipped her coffee. It was Tuesday or Wednesday or one of the other inconsequential days in the soggy middle. She closed her eyes, for no other reason than to indulge in the fantasy that she was a corpse. That life moved around her like a river around a stone. ""Asleep at the wheel again?"" Shut up, Trent. She gestured to the coffee, smiled, ""Not enough in the world."" Two more years. Masochistic students drenched in exhaustion complaining about sadistic teachers with soulless bloodshot eyes complaining about students. Two years and she would be helping people, really helping people, people with problems beyond AP Chem or remedial English. She closed her eyes. 

Jupiter's thesis was on dissociation in everyday life. There had to be a way of inciting it manually, she had always thought. A way of distancing yourself, taking a step back from the harsh closeness of experience. Autopilot. She opened her eyes. She tried to think about nothing, which is itself a paradox. Perhaps not thinking at all was a more achievable goal. There was a chip in the white wall immediately across from her. She stared at it, unblinking. In her peripheral the wall began to dissolve into the faintly rainbow fuzzy grids and dots, the background static of her eyes. Her inner voice sunk to a whisper. She closed her eyes. Silence.

Jupiter opened her eyes.

""And I just don't know if he understands the effect it has on me, or if he's completely unaware, or if it even matters, or which is worse."" Jupiter sat in a plush leather chair with thick armrests, outlined in silver metal dots. She was wearing a white sundress blooming light blue flowers, and across from her was a woman. There was a clock on the yellow wall across from her, reading 5:10pm. Two hours had passed. More troublingly, she did not know where she was. ""Anyway I don't know if he even thinks about the thought process of other people, or if he even thinks at all."" A dense grogginess was slowly receding. She checked her phone. No messages. She looked at it again. Saturday. Saturday? Saturday. It was not Saturday. The woman was looking at her intently. Words began to form in Jupiter's mouth. ""Does that seem to be common behavior for Dylan? You mentioned a similar lack of awareness in him a couple sessions ago, regarding your sister."" This was interesting. A vague understanding slipped across her brain. Two years. Jupiter smiled.",1,1748362883.0,flashfiction,0,1.0,False

( I’m 29F and have been staying at my moms since january this year, and was hoping to move out by June/July)
anyways. due to the way the company ended the employees (all of us were friends and would hang out outside of work) were split and this led to back n forths and just complete losses of friendships all together. 
on top of that, i’ve been working little odd jobs here and there when i can (shout out Instawork) and trying to stay productive but it’s like i can’t
ever since i lost my job it’s like it takes everything in me just to make a cup of coffee or pick my clothes up off the floor. I feel pathetic just writing that but it’s true. Sometimes my boyfriend comes over just to cook and clean for me or “take me on a walk” like im some old person who can’t take care of themselves. I feel so embarrassed by this even though im so grateful for him.  Even with the support of my partner and mom I know deep down that the only one who’s going to break me out of this funk is me. I know I want better for myself it just feels impossible. 
I don’t want to be depressed anymore. I don’t want to eat Mcdonald’s 3 days in a row or have a whole bottle of wine to myself. 
I’ve deleted my instagram cause all I’ve been doing is watching other people I know thrive and travel and enjoy their lives, while I feel like I’m wasting away. There are times when I question why I’m even alive or questioning if i even have a purpose.
I don’t want this to be any longer than it already is, my whole point in writing this was to ask for advice if anyone has any. 
What are some ways you have pulled yourself out of a dark place? What are ways to be productive and move forward during times of depression? 
Any advice, constructive criticism, or tough love is appreciated. Thanks all in advance",2,1748362865.0,Adulting,2,1.0,False

Short Bible Study with me about Matthew 25:40

Introduction
------------

In a world where every act of kindness can create a ripple effect, the teachings of the Bible remind us of the profound impact we can have on others. By serving those around us with love and compassion, we strengthen our connection to God Himself. How would our lives change if we truly believed that every kind deed was sacred?

Today, let’s dive into a powerful message from Matthew 25:40. This verse encourages us to see the face of Christ in everyone we meet, inspiring us to act with generosity and love. Imagine the transformation that can occur when we embrace this message in our daily lives. Ready to explore?

Bible Verse
-----------

“The King will reply, ‘Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.'” — Matthew 25:40 (NIV)

Meaning
-------

Matthew 25:40 is part of the parable of the sheep and the goats, where Jesus speaks about the final judgment. Through this verse, Jesus emphasizes that our actions toward others are directly connected to our relationship with Him. When we serve others, especially those in need, we are serving Christ Himself.

This passage challenges us to recognize the presence of Christ in every individual. Our daily interactions become opportunities to express our faith in tangible ways. It calls us to step outside our comfort zones and extend grace and compassion, reflecting the love of Jesus.

Furthermore, this verse reminds us that no act of kindness is too small. Whether it’s a comforting word, a helping hand, or a smile, each gesture holds eternal significance. By embodying this truth, we align ourselves with God’s heart and purpose.

Ultimately, Matthew 25:40 is a call to action, inviting us to live out our faith through concrete expressions of love. It transforms ordinary moments into extraordinary encounters with the divine.

4. Offer words of encouragement and prayer for someone who may be struggling.

5. Create a habit of gratitude, acknowledging God’s presence in all your interactions.

Journal Prompts

2. How can you better recognize Christ in the people you encounter daily?

3. What are some tangible ways you can serve your community this week?

4. Write about a person who inspires you with their acts of kindness.

5. What barriers prevent you from serving others, and how can you overcome them?

Prayer
------

Dear Lord, thank You for Your Word and the reminder that serving others is serving You. Help me see Your face in everyone I meet and inspire me to act with love and compassion. Guide my heart to recognize the needs around me and respond with grace. May my actions always reflect Your love and bring glory to Your name. Amen.

It shapes our interactions, influences our relationships, and ultimately drives our success. Understanding the nuances of both formal and informal communication, as well as the role of non-verbal cues and the grapevine, can significantly enhance our professional interactions.

 

1.       [Formal Communication](https://www.learngtr.in/formal-and-informal-channels-of) refers to the structured and official channels through which information flows within an organization. This includes emails, reports, meetings, and presentations. Formal communication is essential for clarity, accountability, and record-keeping. It ensures that everyone is on the same page and that important information is disseminated in a consistent manner.

2.       Informal Communication encompasses the casual exchanges that occur among colleagues. This can happen during coffee breaks, team lunches, or even through social media platforms. Informal communication fosters camaraderie and can lead to innovative ideas and solutions. It often serves as a vital complement to formal channels, allowing for a more relaxed and open exchange of thoughts.

3.       [Non-Verbal Communication](https://www.learngtr.in/nonverbal-talk-what-is-it-and-why-does) plays a pivotal role in how our messages are received. Body language, facial expressions, and even tone of voice can convey emotions and intentions that words alone may not express. Being aware of our non-verbal cues, as well as those of others, can enhance our understanding and improve our interactions. For instance, maintaining eye contact can demonstrate confidence and engagement, while crossed arms might signal defensiveness or disinterest.

4.       [Grapevine](https://www.learngtr.in/whats-grapevine-is-it-hurting-your-work)—the informal network through which information spreads within an organization. While often viewed with scepticism, the grapevine can be a powerful tool for gauging employee sentiment and gathering insights. It’s essential to recognize that while not all information shared through this channel is accurate, it reflects the collective concerns and interests of the workforce. Leaders should be mindful of the grapevine and strive to provide clear and timely information to mitigate misunderstandings.

 

In conclusion, mastering the art of communication involves recognizing the value of both formal and informal channels, being attuned to non-verbal signals, and understanding the dynamics of the grapevine. By fostering an environment that encourages open dialogue and active listening, we can enhance collaboration and drive our organizations toward success.
