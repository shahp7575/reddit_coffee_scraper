\-----------------------------------------------------

The next morning, Tim woke up feeling like he hadn’t slept at all. His body was still heavy with exhaustion, and his mind was foggy. He dragged himself out of bed and shuffled into the kitchen, where he found Nuria already awake. She was sitting at the table, sipping a cup of coffee and scrolling through her phone. She didn’t look up when he entered, and the silence in the room was thick and uncomfortable.

Tim cleared his throat awkwardly. “Good morning,” he said, his voice tentative.

Nuria didn’t respond. She didn’t even glance in his direction. The lack of acknowledgment made Tim feel even more uneasy. He shifted from one foot to the other, unsure of what to do. *Maybe I should apologize,* he thought. *Maybe that will make things better.*

“Uh, Nuria,” he began, his voice hesitant. “I just wanted to say… I’m sorry about last night. I know I wasn’t there for your foot massage, and I—”

Nuria cut him off with a sharp look, her eyes narrowing as she finally turned to face him. “Don’t,” she said coldly. “Just don’t.”

Tim’s words died in his throat. He felt a pang of guilt, even though he knew deep down that none of this was his fault. *Why do I even care if she’s mad at me?* he wondered. But somehow, he did. He wanted her to be happy with him, even if he couldn’t quite explain why.

The awkward silence stretched on until the doorbell rang, breaking the tension. Nuria glanced at Tim and said curtly, “You’re paying for this.”

Tim blinked, confused, but he didn’t argue. He went to the door and opened it to find a deliveryman holding a small package. Tim paid for the delivery, his mind racing with questions. *What is this? And why do I have to pay for it?*

He brought the package back to the kitchen and handed it to Nuria. She took it without a word and began to open it, her movements deliberate. Tim watched her, his curiosity growing. “What’s in it?” he asked, unable to help himself.

Nuria didn’t answer right away. Instead, she set the package down and looked at him, her expression serious. “I’ve had a lot of time to think,” she began, her voice calm but firm. “About how you disappointed me yesterday. You weren’t there for my foot massage, and you forgot to bring my shoes from my mom’s house. How could you forget something so important?”

Tim opened his mouth to explain, to tell her again that it wasn’t his fault, that Eva had kept him working all day and night. But before he could say anything, Nuria held up a hand to silence him.

“Don’t,” she said sharply. “I don’t want to hear excuses. The fact is, you let me down. And I can’t let that slide.”

Tim felt a mix of emotions—guilt, frustration, and a strange desire to make things right. *I don’t even know why I care so much,* he thought. *But I do. I want her to be happy with me.*

Nuria continued, her tone becoming almost businesslike. “So, I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands. I bought something that will ensure you give me your absolute best from now on. And if you don’t…” She paused, her eyes locking onto his. “Well, let’s just say I’ll have a way to motivate you.”

Tim’s stomach churned as Nuria reached into the package and pulled out a long, sleek whip. His eyes widened in shock, and he took an involuntary step back. “W-what is that for?” he stammered, his voice barely above a whisper.

Nuria smiled, but it wasn’t a warm smile. It was sharp and calculating. “This,” she said, holding up the whip, “is my insurance policy. If you don’t do your absolute best for me, if you disappoint me again, I’ll use this to remind you of your place.”

Tim’s mind raced. He felt a strange mix of fear and something else—something he couldn’t quite put into words. Part of him wanted to protest, to tell her this was insane. But another part of him, a part he didn’t fully understand, felt a strange pull toward her. *Why do I want her approval so badly?* he wondered.

Nuria set the whip down on the table and leaned back in her chair, her eyes never leaving his. “So, Timmy,” she said, her voice soft but commanding. “What’s it going to be? Are you going to give me your absolute best? Or do I need to start using this?”

Tim swallowed hard, his throat dry. “I… I’ll do my best,” he said quietly, his voice trembling.

Nuria smiled again, this time with a hint of satisfaction. “Good,” she said. “I’m glad we understand each other.”

The whip was perfect. It was a symbol of her power, a physical reminder of what would happen if he stepped out of line. And the best part? She didn’t even have to use it. Just the threat would be enough to keep him in check.

Nuria leaned back in her chair, her mind wandering. She thought about all the ways she could use this new tool to her advantage. Maybe she’d make him clean the entire house on his hands and knees. Or perhaps she’d have him cook her a five-course meal, with the whip resting on the table as a constant reminder of what would happen if he messed up.

The possibilities were endless, and Nuria felt a thrill of excitement at the thought. She had always enjoyed having control over Tim, but this… this was something else entirely. This was power, pure and simple.

As she sat there, her thoughts turned to the future. She imagined a life where Tim was completely subservient, where he did everything she asked without question, without hesitation. A life where she never had to lift a finger, where all her needs were met before she even had to ask.

It was a beautiful thought, and Nuria couldn’t wait to make it a reality. 

Tim stood there, feeling completely out of his depth. He didn’t know what to say or do. All he knew was that, for some reason, he wanted to make Nuria happy—even if it meant bending to her will.",1,1738858175.0,cuck_femdom_tales,0,1.0,False
1ij63pe,https://www.reddit.com/r/orangecounty/comments/1ij63pe/apartment_recommendationsadvice/,Apartment Recommendations/Advice!,"Hello fellow Orange County friends!  
I've been looking for a 1 bedroom apartment/townhome unit in north OC area midway between family in Yorba Linda, and work in El Segundo (currently looking at Cypress, Cerritos, Los Al, etc...) Really hoping to spend even slightly less than $3k/monthly. 

  
Currently living Marina Del Rey in a complex that I LOVE and feel very safe/looked after - just hate LA and have no motivation to leave my place other than work because of traffic/parking...

I am pickier/have higher standards than most when it comes to accommodation and am having trouble finding many options. The ones I have found include Acadia Apartments, Aria Apartments, and Los Alamitos Luxury Apartments. They are more than I wanted to spend in this area compared to what I am paying living right on the water but it seems prices have just increased all-around.  
Somewhere newer where I can walk to stores/coffee shops, has maintenance and security teams, good property management, parking, **in-unit washer/dryer**, not on a main busy road, etc....

I know this sounds picky/specific, but I am hoping one of you wonderful people has a hidden-gem of a suggestion! :)

Thank you SOOO much in advance!!!",1,1738858143.0,orangecounty,0,1.0,False

Recently, I've encountered an issue that randomly recoccurs. Coffee will not come out of the spout into my cup, it gets redirected right to the overflow/waste bin. Its happens whenever, ie, I might have made a beautiful cup, not changed anything, put a new cup under the spout and selected ""Coffee Me"" please. It makes all the normal sounds, but the coffee doesn't go into the cup. :(

 I've done just about everything to clear it, from running a full Rinse, taken the water compartment off and back on, reseated the brew unit, descaled, cleaned, unplugged it. No reason, it will start working again. Makes about 1, 5, 50 cups, and stop working again. I run through a full rinse, remove the water, reseat the brew unit. Maybe it starts working right away, sometimes I do these 2 - 3 times then starts working.

I am wasting my expensive coffee beans, and have recently gotten the feeling of ""Do I really love this thing?""

Anyone have any ideas? Something I can do at home? Do I need to send this back to Miele? If the later, what is the costs of a Miele repair? ",1,1738858085.0,Miele,0,1.0,False
1ij62an,https://www.reddit.com/r/askCardiology/comments/1ij62an/coffee_phenomenon/,Coffee Phenomenon,"Hey, so I (21) have been to a cardiologist, had an ECHO and everything came out fine structurally (apart from benign: IRBBB and trace regurgitation).

I seem to experience a weird phenomenon with coffee, I drank it this morning and then pretty quickly became quite relaxed/mellow.

Now, I ask here because I went to lay down in bed (this is around 4 hours later) and it seems to have **decreased** my resting heart rate quite noticeably, all whilst blood pressure was optimal.
 
Usually during the day whilst awake I’ll rarely go under ~64, but with coffee I have seen lows of 46 whilst laying with eyes closed, and it sitting around high 50’s low 60’s when I’m sat and mentally focusing on something like this thread.

I haven’t felt dizzy or anything like that, and it only dropped to 46 whilst I was trying to have a nap (my sleep bpm goes as low as 42)

I just find this really strange, my heart rate seems to drop after the use of coffee, even though it’s meant to be a vasoconstrictor and stimulant - and I don’t usually drink caffeine especially as of late, haven’t been an addict etc

Would appreciate in insights as I’m curious, thanks! :)",1,1738858045.0,askCardiology,0,1.0,False
1ij61wn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1ij61wn/should_i_check_in_with_my_friend_again_after_she/,Should I check in with my friend again after she moved away but didn’t reply to my last message?,"My (26F) friend Daisy (25F) and I have been friends since we met in school at 11 years old. We are close friends, she even describes me as her closest friend to others but because of how she is as a person I struggle with the definition of our friendship at times and how to be around her. (I will elaborate further down).

Daisy got a big job opportunity abroad and moved away starting a new life recently. When she first left after a couple of days even though I was travelling long haul myself and very busy I made sure to message her saying I hope she’s got there safely and is settling into her new home and job. Obviously it’s way too early to give any proper update on anything but I expected a reply at least confirming she got there safely and just an acknowledgement that it’s all very exciting/new/warm, what the area is like on first impressions, what her new place is like etc., but she didn’t reply and instead just applied a “heart” reaction to my message. 

I did think afterwards that I guess I didn’t actually ask her anything as I worded it all as “I hope..” but with anyone else that still usually implies you’re asking how it’s going and they reply accordingly. 

I was very busy away on my own travels so I left it and assumed she would message when she has settled in a bit or has time or something more to update on, but I never heard from her. A few weeks have passed now and she casually messaged making a joke about a story I posted on my social media and I replied back about it. But it felt strange as we’ve not had any interaction or acknowledgement about her new life. I have zero idea of what’s gone on with her since she left the country. 

I’ve been back from my travels and it’s been a few weeks since she moved now and I keep wondering wether to message her now to literally ask how things are going and what’s happened since she got there, and with anyone else that would be the normal and natural thing to do. However with Daisy there’s a lot of confusion of how to address things because of her unusual behaviour and expectations over the years. 

It would take a long time to explain things so I’m going to try to bullet point it. 

* She has a lot of expectations of how friends should treat her and gets offended if you go either way with them but a lot of it is stuff that most people don’t find normal. 
* When she moved away for university within the same country she was really offended that I didn’t go to visit her when she came back home for the holidays as “It was the first time she’s moved away from home” and refused to meet up with me for a meal. I explained to her lots of our friends moved away and I didn’t visit any of them specially and this meet up *was* how we’d all catch up. 
* When she got her first job after graduating she was offended that we didn’t celebrate her by arranging something. We did go in the end for a meal.
* Whenever something that’s a milestone happens in her life she wants it acknowledged in quite a formal way and see our reactions, she’ll arrange to meet us in advance so that she can tell us at a proper meal or coffee meet up only rather than just tell us in a message or call. She’ll delay telling us big news for days or even weeks till the meet up, like she did about her moving abroad by which time she had only a few weeks left in the country. 
* Despite wanting a lot of attention for things she chooses she’s also extremely private to a degree which we can’t wrap our head around. She will refuse to tell us normal things like if we casually ask where she’s going on holiday or who the family member she was just seen talking to was and act like we’re out of line. It’s hard to know what is okay to ask and what isn’t and stifles our friendship and natural conversation.
* She once disappeared for 6 months without warning and naturally we tried to find out if she’s okay and what’s happened and she got angry with us for asking and said we’re out of line to keep asking. Later it turned out she had moved away within the country for a job, that it was a really happy and exciting time for her and we weren’t allowed to ask anything, but we didn’t even know we weren’t allowed to ask anything till she got angry. It was scary being shot down and getting a lecture about not asking her things and the fact that she was okay disappearing for 6 months like that isn’t easy to forget. 
* She tells us again and again she doesn’t like people asking her questions about her life and finds it really intrusive and she purposefully just ignores people that ask her things. 
* She asks us plenty about our life and we answer normally, because it’s normal for friends to enquire about each others life in an interested and caring way. 
* Sometimes she’s fine with us asking things about her life, tries to get us to ask by putting attention on herself and trying to trigger questions about certain subjects and revels in it, tying in with how she does like attention about things she’s okay with us talking about. But we never know what will be okay or not, it’s a nervous guessing game.
* She never tells us if she’s going on holiday, even if you see her the day before. And if you do know she’s going and ask where she’s going she won’t answer. But after she has been on a holiday she will try to arrange a get together and will talk about it the whole time, encourage questions and for the conversation to always veer back to her holiday through the whole meal. 
* Awhile after she’d told us she’s moving abroad she messaged to say don’t tell anyone else as she’s planning on telling no one except immediate family and us few close friends. I had already casually mentioned it in passing to a relative who knows of my friend as..why would I have ever thought it would be a secret? I told my relative to never tell anyone, as we all have mutual connections locally. 
* Just before she left I went to visit to say goodbye and took a present. I felt nervous because I didn’t know what I could ask or say about her move. There was no one else there to say goodbye because no one knew, it felt really strange. 
* Again at this last time of spending time with her she started talking about how she’s not telling anyone else in her life because she hates people asking her questions and why do people ask so many questions and that she’s a private person and like everyone else is strange and out of order.  I felt even more nervous because I was there with her for the last time and I felt like I couldn’t even say goodbye properly because I wasn’t sure I could barley even acknowledge that she’s moving abroad with the things she was saying. The goodbye felt extremely stilted and inauthentic because of this which is really sad, but she didn’t seem to be phased at all. 

So taking into account her personality and her inconsistent expectations I am not even sure if I should be messaging her again to ask how things are for her and what it’s like there etc. I can’t even figure out if she’ll find it intrusive that I’m messaging *again* and this time asking proper questions when she already “acknowledged” my first message and that she would update me if she wanted. 

Or whether she’ll be offended that I didn’t ask her how she is and how things are properly after she’s settled in and haven’t given her proper time and attention as a friend, as obviously permanently moving away abroad is not a small thing. And you could say that my first message doesn’t really count as she’d only just arrived then and it was just an acknowledgement that she’s got there. 

TL:DR - Friend moved away abroad but I can’t figure out wether to ask her how things are or make much contact because of how unpredictable her expectations for privacy are",1,1738858018.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

We've been dating for 10 months and recently completed the procedures to move in together next month. He is a scorp sun, libra moon, aqua rising, scorp venus and I am aqua sun, pisces moon, gemini rising, sag venus

He bought me a cake and we had sex after. I asked him for a shirt as I've never worn his shirt before. He's very lean but fit and goes to the gym while I'm not fat but not thin either.

His shirt was too snug on me, and i felt a bit down about it but didn't voice it out. And while we were joking around in bed, my boyfriend went, ""So what is your goal weight for that event again?"" And I started accusing him that he thinks I'm fat.

For some context, I've been trying to lose weight and hitting the gym, but I've been plateauing for a few weeks. And I've talked to him about these things. He's never called me fat, and he has reassured me that he would love me at every size. But i have not talked to him about my body image issues as i wasn't ready yet. We share everything else with each other and keep it pretty open communication -wise. 

So i feel like crying, and he asks if i wanna have some cake. I reply that he's made me conscious, so I'll have a spoon. He looked a bit upset. After a few mins, I went to the bathroom, bawled my eyes out, washed my face twice, and then stepped out to see that 2 plates of cake were set on the coffee table. He saw me and knew that I'd cried. I cried even more as he reassured me a lot abou me being pretty and he's told me he doesn't care about physical looks in the long run but he added to the end  ""i don't care even if people say 'why does she look like that'? I love you"" and i ask him, ""What do you mean? What do i look like???"" That one hurt, regardless of the intention.

He went to shower, came back, and said he's disappointed and that he thought we had open communication between us and that it'sbeen 10 months and this is how much i trust him. He said he was doubting whether anything else he's ever said anout other topics like stocks etc was also perceived differently by me and then had me leave his house in the next mins, saying we both need space.

I sent him a very long text message once i reached home explaining that i reacted that way because of body image issues and that I am working on it. And that i wanted to clarify it's more of a me problem and to let me know once he was ready to have a talk before he comes to any conclusions by himself. And that i love him. 

He responds to my big paragraphs with a single line, saying, ""we can talk later this week. Love you too"". Followed by 4 days of uninterrupted radio silence. 

I don't wanna text him anymore out of my self respect even though it's driving me nuts. I personally would not treat my partner like that on their birthday of all days. I wanted yalls pov on what i did wrong here that would warrant 4 days of silent treatment in the name of space..? It almost feels punitive tbh. Is this normal scorp behavior? And if he comes back, how can i avoid this in the future while also ensuring he communicates properly?


TL;DR: i fought with my boyfriend on my birthday, and he made me leave his house after the fight. I went home and sent a long text explaining my issues and struggles and that we should chat once he's ready and to reach out. It's been 4 days, and he still hasn't contacted me.

Wife and I are planning a 12 day trip in April for our anniversary and I'm somewhat stunlocked at all the choices on places to visit and things to do. Our itinerary and specific questions are below but am also open to general recommendations for food, specific tour companies, or things I might have missed completely.

**Questions**

1. From maps it looks like it would be easier to fly in and out of Liberia, but most tours and reviews seem to always go through San Jose. Is there any concerns we should have with flying into/out of Liberia or is it usually San Jose simply because it's a bigger airport?
2. For whitewater rafting, most reviews seem to prefer Pacuare over Saraquipi. We have found tours for both that will pick us up in La Fortuna but Pacuare is obviously a much longer drive and day. Is it worth it?
3. Our time in Tamarindo is mostly supposed to be relaxing on the beach after the craziness of the 8 days prior but is there anything we shouldn't miss doing while there or is there something we are missing in La Fortuna/Monteverde that would make it worth extending our stay there an extra day and shortening our time in Tamarindo?

He talks to me about plumbing /electricity/ hydraulics/ mechanical stuff  and most of the terminology can be thought of as quite sexual ( male goes into the female, rams, you name it) and I’ll raise and eyebrow and he’ll catch it and smile for a split second and keep going. I found my gardening knee pads and while he is sitting across from me I tell him I found them and smile with a question mark on my face and he smiles back and goes back to reading. He is stepping down into the kitchen and I am 2 feet below him and wrap my arms around him with my face right in his groin and say “ that’s a perfect height wink wink” and he gives me a nice hug and grabs his coffee. We are sitting next to each other talking about how much protein we’re planning on eating daily per lb/weight and I say “ how much protein can I get from you is the question ;)” and he smiles because he gets it and moves onto chicken or turkey being better protein wise. I come back from my jog up the hill with both jacket and shirt opened up, no bra and all flush and he say oh wow and grazes my breasts and gets back to wiping the counter. Have I told him straight up I want to be fucked ? No. He looks and me with a knowing smile so he gets my hints. He looks at naked women online so rule out the gay option. We don’t fight hardly at all. I don’t emasculate him and appreciate all his does. It’s been gradual and painful. I know he worries someone else will snatch me up because he tells me and keeps in constant contact when I go into town. He compliments me right as I am leaving and it feels like he worries someone else will compliment me. What is going on? I am trying to avoid a confrontation that will add more pressure to our sex life because  that can become self fulfilling. I don’t want him to because I want to, I want him to want me like I want him. ",1,1738857649.0,DeadBedrooms,0,1.0,False

We've booked flights and accommodation so pretty tied to the itinerary as it is but I would appreciate any advice or recommendations. I'm into gaming (Nintendo and Pokémon), coffee and photography, she's into history and particularly wants to see the cherry blossoms. We both want to see the main sites and are big foodies (so any food/restaurant recommendations would be greatly appreciated!). We're both pretty fit and walk/run regularly a few times a week so hoping we will be fine with the amount of walking. We don't have a strict budget but don't really want to pay crazy prices at expensive restaurants (maybe 1 or treats), we're happy with simple stuff. I've been learning Japanese for the past year and a half and can form fairly basic sentences but hope to continue learning even after we come back. I've been planning since summer last year and spent many, many hours trying to perfect the itinerary, using Word Documents, Excel Spreadsheets and Google My Maps with hundreds of pins.

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I've been pulling espresso at home for close to ten years now. Over this decade I've ebbed and flowed between small batch roasters and big store bags. This comes with a big gamble every time, especially the latter.

Picking up a bag that you've never tasted before could be an amazing experience or completely trash. It's those times that it's been trash that really puts a damper on the day. What's worse is that (if you're like me) you need to finish that bag of beans before buying the next. Money is too tight these days to buy some coffee just to throw it away.

So after some brainstorming and bitter shots I started a website for crowd sourcing coffee bean rating called RoastQuest.com. No account needed. Just submit your favorite (and least favorite) beans and scroll through the list to find what may become your next coffee bean of choice.

Had really good conversation and have a lot of common interests, I was really into her and she seemed into me.

After the first date I had probably one of the shittest weeks of my career, working just shy of 100 hours and this coupled with my dog being violently sick so I had to keep bringing him outside throughout the night meaning I got no sleep the few hours I was at home for the two nights before our second date that Friday.  

I was gonna just cancel or ask to postpone as I was physically exhausted, but didn’t want to seem disinterested and thought it would be smooth sailing anyways judging off how well we got along on the first date. In hindsight, this was a terrible idea and I was a complete zombie for the second date, conversation was forced and I was just not in the right mind at all. 

The next day I texted her to say hope she had a good night etc. knowing fully well I had bottled it. She replied saying she doesn’t think she sees it going further and doesn’t want to waste my time. I just said back that I’m sorry if I came across as awkward as I was exhausted and I would’ve liked to give it another shot but haven’t heard back since.

In every other circumstance I would just take it in my stride and move on but this has been on my mind all week. We had a connection when I was in the right mind and I know the second date wasn’t a fair representation of me. I’d usually never double text anybody, but I really want to ask her to meet even for ten minutes for a coffee and let me explain myself, and if she still doesn’t have any interest in trying again then just move on.

This is **stupidly** long. It’s not just about my experience of speaking and understanding Spanish in Colombia, but is also about the trip itself, cities I visited and such. Thus, please feel free to skip any sections that look boring to you. They’re all labelled.

**A few notes**  
I don’t use Spanish in my posts, unless talking about the names of things; food, TV shows and the like. I wouldn’t want beginners to feel that they need to look up words.

I don’t record myself speaking as I value my anonymity. I only really feel comfortable sharing things about my autism and such because of that relative anonymity. I also don’t share details of my teachers. This is partly because I was once asked by a former teacher to not link to her profile on Reddit. However, [I wrote a guide](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/s/BWcw5A3YrU) on finding your own. I do value my teacher greatly. She’s awesome.

I very rarely used Google Translate during conversations; if it's not mentioned, I didn't use it.

**Background**  
This is my second trip to Colombia. I was at around 1,250 hours when I arrived the first time and you can see a more [detailed account here](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1bipd8c/how_my_trip_to_colombia_feels_at_level_6/).

I was at just over 2,900 hours of input when I arrived in late November. Keep in mind I have both ADHD and Asperger’s syndrome and have always had learning difficulties. In other words, I’d expect that most people would be more advanced with the same number of hours.

**Why I chose Colombia & what to know before you go**  
I didn't *need* Spanish in my daily life and chose to learn it because I think it's a beautiful language. That resulted in some motivation issues soon after I first started to use DS. I booked my first trip to give myself a reason to focus. I chose Colombia because of the country’s clear accents, the fact that Colombians pronounce every letter in words and they generally speak much more slowly than Spaniards.If you're thinking of going to Colombia and Latam in general, keep safety in mind. If you have travelled a lot and take basic precautions, you’ll likely be fine. Make sure you do plenty of your own research, though.

I chose to take extra precautions in El Poblado specifically, more so than other areas of the country. Put simply, while I believe that most Colombians are good people, there’s a small percentage of people who aren’t so great. The likelihood of being targeted by someone seemed higher in the one neighbourhood that’s packed full of foreigners and where local people know you’re a tourist. However, there are other areas with elevated risks. Again, do your own research.

**Speaking progress**  
I was at a low A2 level when I arrived in Colombia in March 2024. Although I could function in restaurants, cafes and have pretty basic conversations with my hosts, people had to politely put up with my awful pronunciation and *terrible* grammar. Additionally, some people simply didn’t understand me.

Almost no one in Colombia seemed to have problems understanding me this time. There was one exception, but we’ll get to that. My pronunciation in particular has improved *a lot*. I am also now able to use a much broader range of conjugations with ease. Embarrassingly, I conjugated everything for the present tense last time.

My teacher said I was a little below a B1 speaking level on arrival for this second trip. From what I’ve read, a B1 requires mastery of around 9 sets of conjugations. I’d say I could confidently and reliably use 5 or 6 at the time. My pronunciation also still needed a lot of work. Both of these things improved during the trip.

**Speaking benchmarks**  
It’s easy to check my progress with listening; I just watch an episode from a few specific shows every 500 hours of input. That’s not possible with speaking. For that reason, I returned to both El Poblado and Bogotá. This allowed me to test myself via conversations with the Airbnb hosts I met last time. Unfortunately, the guy in El Poblado is young, out a lot and I didn’t speak to him much. However, my hosts in the capital seemed very impressed with the difference. They complimented my phrasing and conjugations multiple times, as well as my vocabulary. This was my second Airbnb in Bogotá and the last stop in Colombia. So I’d been waiting to hear that the entire time.

**Pricing and cities**  
All prices shown will be in Colombian pesos, AKA COP. For reference, the major exchange rates were as follows at the start of my trip: £1 = 5,500 COP, $1 = 4,500 COP and €1 = 4,700 COP.

As well as Medellín and the capital, I visited Santa Marta, Pereira, Cartagena and Popayán this time. I thought I’d cover the basics of how each city felt, costs and such for those interested in visiting Colombia.

All the stays I booked during this trip were via Airbnb. I had a dedicated workspace and washing machine everywhere I went. Unless noted, all my stays were in private rooms in a house or apartment. This consistency makes it easy to compare prices/value for money in different cities and Medellín’s zones.

I’ll start with Medellín because it’s popular and I visited multiple zones of the city.

*Medellín: El Poblado*  
El Poblado is considered the most fashionable part of this city. That means it’s overrun with foreigners, many of whom don’t speak - and have no interest in learning - Spanish. Many businesses understandably go out of their way to cater to these foreigners. The result of this is a loss of Colombian character; fewer local/authentic food options, more Western brands and, of course, higher prices. Locals are very much used to certain types of customers, so waiters etc will often reply in English if they think you don’t understand or just because your accent or Spanish pronunciation is bad.

You will stand out as a tourist; either based on how you dress, act or where you’re eating. Some locals hate tourism and the higher prices, tipping culture and such to which it’s led. I can’t emphasise enough how much of a bad choice this zone would be if you want an authentic Colombian experience.

A result of tons of tourists who don’t understand Spanish is that people are often ripped-off in El Poblado and pay even more than the already exaggerated official menu prices. I didn’t encounter this anywhere else in the country.

My accommodation was around 83,000 COP a night there.

*Medellín: the Buenos Aires zone*  
When I asked Gemini how touristy this zone was, it confidently told me it was really touristy. AI tools are useful, but this is an example of one getting it *totally* wrong. I mention this simply to point out that doing your own research is important.

This zone is only around 5 or 6 kilometres away from El Poblado, but it’s practically a different world. You’ll find just a few big name international restaurants  in this zone. Cash is 100% required and attitudes are very different. El Poblado is packed full of vegetarian and vegan options, whereas those concepts are not only alien but funny to some in Buenos Aires. I found three vegetarian restaurants in the zone and Google Maps essentially told me to go to El Poblado for more. I once tried to order something without meat from a restaurant that lacked meat-free options on its menu. The waiter definitely understood I wanted an arepa with cheese. I made it very clear that I don’t eat meat and punctuated this with the words for *I don’t eat chicken, beef or pork*. He repeated the words for *no meat* back to me. What arrived? An arepa with cheese, yes. And ham.

Not only is Spanish required to function in this zone, but tourists are *incredibly* rare. This is the only area during my whole trip where I had consistent problems being understood. My British accent remains\* (more on that later!) when I speak Spanish. I was much harder to understand/tolerate during my first trip to the country, but almost everyone in the capital and El Poblado understood me just fine. Months - and a *lot* of improvements to my pronunciation - later, quite a few people in this particular zone had real issues understanding me. This simply didn’t happen in other cities.

A small example of price differences between these zones would be budget restaurants. In El Poblado, I’d expect to pay around 35,000 to 45,000 COP for a main course. It’s very easy indeed to get a typical Colombian meal for as little as 14,000 COP in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood. Including a drink. Additionally, hot dogs can be had from street vendors for around 10,000 and empanadas can be had for between 1,500 and 2,000. As you can see, El Poblado isn’t expensive by Western standards. However, Buenos Aires is crazy cheap.

My accommodation was around 45,000 COP a night there. That price included a balcony view from my room.

I initially booked a total of 21 nights in El Poblado during this trip, spread over three stays. Mostly because it would allow me to interact with a host I stayed with during my first trip and thus benchmark my speaking with him. The first - 2 nights - was fine. However, the direct result of staying in the BA district was that I found myself despising EP after just a few days into the second stay. So much so that I ended up cancelling the third. The lack of an Ara supermarket nearby alone bothered me. This would be a little like not having a Tesco within 5 kilometres of you in a major UK city. This gave me the opportunity to explore other zones of the city. I split the 12 cancelled nights between a zone called Belén and one called Guayabal.

*Medellín: Belén*  
Various websites and travel blogs describe Belén as the most authentic, least touristy part of  Medellín. That sounded perfect. I’m not sure I’d agree with this per se. It’s much like the Buenos Aires zone in many ways. However, it borders Laureles, a trendier zone that has more Western food options. That’s not a bad thing per se. It does however make Belén feel smaller than it really is.

There was an [American](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1i5clx2/a_small_pronunciation_victory/) \- who couldn’t speak Spanish and to whom I introduced DS - staying at the same accommodation as me while I was in Belén. Other than him, I don’t recall seeing any other Western tourists during my time there. Everything was calm, laid-back and felt like Colombia. Empanada stands, bakeries all over the place, Aras close by. I think you’ll understand what I’m getting at if you’ve read this far.

The aforementioned guy essentially forced me to speak English because he couldn't speak Spanish. After going there regularly for 3 years. Honestly, apart from the inconvenience to others, I'd be embarrassed. It’s also incredibly inconsiderate. The potential of being *that lazy foreigner* is precisely why I gave myself a hard deadline by booking a trip. Anyway, I was forced to speak English while around him in the house. The silver lining is that it reminded me why improving and working on my Spanish is important. I would say don't be that guy, but we're not that guy;  we're here 🙂

He said he manages to function in Colombia, but that involves shoving his phone in people’s faces to use Google Translate and getting supermarket employees to show him phone or calculator displays because he can’t understand numbers when he hears them.

Despite the fact that this part of the city is absolutely authentic and I encountered only one Western tourist, I was understood very easily in most situations. Could it be that my pronunciation improved dramatically in around a month? I honestly have no idea. I know that my pronunciation definitely improved during the trip and that some local people disagreed with me during the last few weeks when I apologised for it being terrible. However, I can’t tell you exactly how much it improved or how quickly.

My accommodation was around 55,000 COP a night there.

*Medellín: Guayabal*   
This zone borders El Poblado. I stayed in a normal family home. My bedroom had a private bathroom for the below price. Given that, this zone might be a good compromise for many; it’s a 10-minute Uber to El Poblado for those who want easy access to nightlife, but it’s also far from being overrun by tourists. There’s no Ara, but it has all the other normal stuff I’d expect to find in Colombia.

The mother of the family occasionally didn’t understand me, but her three adult children had no problems at all during the week I was here. I lacked a few words when trying to explain some things about their cat, but they understood all the words I knew.

My accommodation was around 55,000 COP a night there, too.

Note: my host called this Barrio Mayorca but Google Maps seems more familiar with the former. I searched Airbnb for Belén and it was so small that this other place also came up and I booked places in both.

*Santa Marta*  
This is a beautiful coastal city with great seafood. There’s tons of nature around and nearby the city. One of those places nearby is a national park that’s worth a visit. It’s not as crazy touristy as El Poblado and most tourists are from Colombia. The accents I heard there were a little different from the others I experienced, but that didn’t hinder my ability to understand. I also had no problems at all being understood there.

In terms of cost, Santa Marta was reasonable. It wasn’t the absolute cheapest place I visited during this trip, but it was far from El Poblado pricing. As an example, I once paid 50,000 COP at a restaurant for lunch. That included a large plate of rice with seafood, a portion of patacones and a local beer.

My accommodation was around 50,700 COP a night there.

*Pereira*  
This isn't really a touristy place. As with any normal, medium-sized city, it’s not utterly devoid of them. There are a few small beautiful areas nearby; you’ll find mountains, bamboo and coffee plants there. I didn’t have many problems being understood. Prices and my general experience reflected a lack of tourism.

Although this place does get some tourists, they don’t seem *that* common. An example of this was when I was about to get off a plane from Bogotá. I looked around and literally everyone I could see had dark hair. Except one. There was this blonde-haired woman in her 20s. Not only was she blonde, but she had a bright pink travel pillow. There’s nothing wrong with being a white tourist, but it made me chuckle.

A nice moment during my time in this city was understanding when I was corrected at the gym. An employee made it clear to me that I was doing squats in an unhealthy way. I typically add around 30 kilos of extra resistance via a kettlebell or a dumbbell, depending on what’s available. Anyway, she said that I was putting too much pressure on my knees and motioned how I should be doing it. To confirm I understood, I essentially replied “when you’re ancient, you need to be more careful with your knees.” This elicited a smiling nod.

My accommodation was around 55,000 COP a night there. In this case, though, it was a tiny apartment, rather than a private room.

*Cartagena*  
Due to a request from my initial host relating to personal issues, I ended up cancelling and choosing another place here. I mention this because I ended up staying fairly far from the centre of the city. While Spanish is likely less necessary in the historical centre - given all the tourism - you absolutely wouldn't be able to function on the outskirts without Spanish.

Like Santa Marta, it was hot here. Consistently 32°C. Unlike Santa Marta, the heat felt like an attack and being outside was harder to bear. Especially after leaving the gym at around 9am. That 32° is essentially a fact of daily life there. The time of year is irrelevant.

My accommodation was around 42,000 COP a night there.

*Bogotá*  
The capital isn’t typically the cheapest city in a country and this is true in the case of Colombia. However, I’d say that El Poblado is more expensive overall. Bogotá is obviously a huge city, so it depends on where you stay. 

I’d say that people didn’t generally care about the fact I wasn’t a local there during the first trip. My accent seemed to have changed by the time I visited the city at the end of this trip. To the point that [I paid less](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ie1qju/bogot%C3%A1_the_compliments_i_waited_10_weeks_to_hear/) for the same food that I had in the same place 6 months earlier. Spanish is essential in much of the city.

The two places I stayed at there averaged around 68,000 COP a night.

*Popayán*  
The white city. This is a very laidback place. It gets religious tourists, but not a ton of regular/Western tourists. In fact, I don't think I saw more than 5 white people in 12 days. Naturally, speaking Spanish is essential to get by here.

I didn’t know what to expect here, but I was blown away. This city is like a small city in the countryside. It has a population of around 320,000, roughly a third less than Bristol in the UK. Bristol is a fairly lush/green city, but there was green *everywhere* around the house in which I stayed in Popayán. However, walk a little under 10 minutes and you’d be in the city. Just a few minutes away from a huge shopping centre/mall, an Ara, restaurants, a Smart Fit gym and such.

My accommodation was around 40,000 COP a night there. I believe it was the cheapest per night of the trip. As usual, I booked a room in a house. What I didn’t know was just how impressive the house would be.

It was a 3-floor building that was built using a lot of marble and wood. Truly lovely. The family who live there are probably the nicest I’ve stayed with in the country thus far. Included in that was a very friendly dog and their daughter who was home from university. She spoke English very well but didn’t push to use it. She was very patient with my ramblings and mostly listened during a conversation that lasted about an hour the morning after I arrived in the city.

I naturally had to write the vast majority of this text while I was in the country in order to avoid forgetting details. Why do I mention this? *Well…*

I heard a knock on the door of my room and my name being called *just* as I finished writing the paragraph about the kind family and their daughter. I was asked if I wanted to try some Natilla, which is a dessert/pudding made a lot in Colombia during December. It was on my list of food to try. I stayed in this house for 12 days from the 6th of January and thought I’d missed the chance to try some during the Christmas period. However, the daughter prepared and offered me some. It was very nice and rich. It was good to be able to cross that off my list.

I had no problems at all being understood here. Given the very low numbers of Western tourists, I can only assume that my pronunciation was improving.

**Getting around**  
One of the common costs that may interest you is Uber. It’s not technically licensed/approved by the government in Colombia, but it's available everywhere and practically everyone uses it. It varied a little, but I believe a 10-minute ride typically cost me a little under 10,000 COP. The only exception to the aforementioned ubiquity would be Popayán. People use InDrive there. I used an airport shuttle once, but have never used normal public transport in Colombia. It’s mostly just paranoia regarding safety that stops me. I believe the country’s integrated public transport system costs about 3,200 COP per day, but I’m honestly not sure.

**“Living” in Colombia**  
I don’t generally do touristy things when I visit Colombia. Being a freelancer means I have to work and there’s also going to the gym to try and not gain *too* much weight from the wide variety of delicious things Colombia has to offer. Thus, my trips to Colombia so far have been more akin to living/existing there than being a tourist. Work for me is teaching English. With students mostly in European time zones, I generally have to be up to work between midnight and 03:00. That usually means no energy for day trips, if I even have the time.

I’m happy to simply exist in Colombia. Going to bakeries and restaurants and interacting with locals is what I like. The main attraction is obviously using the beautiful language in real situations and being surrounded by it every day.

**Tourism**  
As I said, I didn’t do many touristy things during this trip for the aforementioned  reasons. I did little things, like exploring the historical centre of Cartagena, for example. I did however do two fairly touristy day trips.

*Tayrona national park*  
Colombia is the second most biodiverse country on the planet - second only to Brazil - and has tons of beautiful areas.This national park was no exception. I took a public bus and didn’t expect to interact with many people. However, a lot of Colombians go to Santa Marta for holidays and Tayrona is close by. My interactions were very short; mostly just greeting people and responding to various simple questions about how far it was to the beach or pool from where they were. Thankfully, I didn’t hear much English. The public bus was 10,000 COP each way from Santa Marta. It took about an hour, so that seemed very cheap to me.

*Minca*  
This turned out to be one of the best days of my trip. Minca is a beautiful area around 50 minutes from Santa Marta. I took a guided tour that cost 295,000 COP for a day trip. It included lunch, as well as transport to and from a fairly tropical area where coffee is made.

I was fortunate to be in a very small group, with just me and two Brazaillians. The tour had options and I made clear that I’d prefer Spanish. The guide did switch to English at times. Primarily when explaining detailed things about plants and endemic species in the country. Plus when he talked about the history of chocolate and the coffee making process. *However*, I’d say about 65% of the things he said were in Spanish during the roughly 6-hour experience with him. I had no problems understanding him and he clearly understood me well.

Additionally, I managed to communicate in Spanish with the Brazilians and I only switched to English twice to explain a couple of things I knew I couldn’t in Spanish. They were obviously not native speakers and didn’t know some words I couldn’t remember at the time. It was both a success in terms of my Spanish and also a really great day in terms of learning about Colombia.

**General tidbits for those planning to visit Colombia**

* Smart Fit is the easiest option for gyms. They’re in *every* city.
* Éxito is the equivalent of Walmart or Tesco. D1 is akin to Aldi or Lidl and Ara has a great bakery.
* If you’ve a sweet tooth, brownies from Chocorama are unmissable.
* Arequipe is an incredible sauce. You’ll find it in brownies, chocolate, sweets and various sweet breads and pastries. On paper, it's simply a milk and chocolate sauce. That's like saying the Mona Lisa is a painting. It's correct, but insufficient.
* Crepes & Waffles is a good restaurant option if you either find yourself in a crazy expensive area or you’re having a low-confidence Spanish day. It’s 100% Colombian, operates national pricing, has printed menus and does what it says on the tin.
* Most Colombian men in most cities wear trousers, regardless of the weather. The exception is going to the gym/exercise. You’ll stand out less if you also do this. This rule doesn’t apply to women.



**Big wins during this trip**

*A locked out neighbour*  
Someone in one of my Medellín Airbnbs locked himself out of his room. He used my phone to contact the owner,  but we talked about the situation 100% in Spanish. He was a tourist from elsewhere in Colombia and said his English was worse than my Spanish. Some hand gestures were involved, but we had no problems communicating based purely on what I knew.

*Getting lost*  
I got lost pretty badly while trying to find an Airbnb in the BA zone in Medellín. I wandered around for 50 minutes due to a street numbering system that seemed to also confuse locals. 3 local people tried to help me during this time and we had no real problems communicating. I may have missed the odd word here or there, but no issues. My host eventually spotted me. I did have to use Google Translate for a few words that she sent in messages, as I turned off the translate option in Airbnb before the trip started.

*An early lesson without coffee*  
I stupidly forgot to take some instant coffee with me from one city to another. This mistake was a win because I had a 02:00 Spanish lesson the next day, without caffeine. Although I had to use Google Translate more than usual, I was pretty pleased that I communicated fairly well with my teacher. As a side note, I rarely use Google Translate with my teacher now. It's reached the point that I'd rather use a less than ideal word I know/rephrase things or ask her for the term by describing what I mean in Spanish. Honestly, Google Translate feels like a crutch these days.

*A cancelled flight*  
One of my 15 flights was cancelled. This meant dealing with an airline's customer service in Bogotá airport. He insisted on speaking English, I imagine to avoid any possibility of confusion. I insisted on replying in Spanish because duh lol. He clearly understood me and I got a replacement flight.

The fairly substantial delay led to me meeting two women from France. I initially met the “real” French woman. Then her friend - born in Colombia and of course a native speaker - joined us. The first woman's Spanish was okay, but she seemed to struggle with both English and Spanish. More so with English, though, so we used Spanish. We talked for about 10 minutes and it was fine.

Her friend talked with me for a good 20 minutes and I only needed to use an English word three times. No Google Translate for me in conversations like this. She joked after a while that my English was better than my Spanish, but complimented me on my Spanish when I told her it must be a pain to tolerate me speaking.

She essentially said that she had no problem understanding me and that my sentence construction was good and phrases sounded natural. She may have just been being polite, but the compliment wasn't huge, so it felt real. That's also what my teacher sometimes says, so I'll take it as a win. To me, the phrases part is a benefit of changing my input months ago to almost 100% Colombian sources. Hearing so much slang and phrases from people from the country has clearly shaped how I think in the language.

*Being more right than a “local”*  
As you can imagine, each region’s Spanish is chock full of local phrases that don’t make sense when translated. When in a restaurant in the Buenos Aires neighbourhood, I employed a phrase that translates as “how much do I carry?” but is simply another way of asking how much the bill is. I was told *very* confidently by a waiter that I was wrong. He knew I’d only been speaking the language since January 2024 and he was convinced he was right. I’ve heard this phrase *dozens* of times in Colombian telenovelas and have used it in other restaurants without issue. I later explained the situation to my teacher and she said he was wrong and probably from Venezuela.

The above said, I should have expected that restaurant to be weird; they had no pineapple sauce for their hot dogs. Based on what my teacher said, that would be akin to a fish and chip shop in the UK not having vinegar or a burger place in the US not having ketchup.

**Listening/understanding locals & confidence**  
If you’ve read my [most recent progress report](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1hc9pfa/thoughts_listening_comprehension_comparison_at/), it would be fair to expect that I was able to understand people who spoke to me normally. The fact that I’m not a native speaker is obvious and people often subconsciously adjust how they speak to accommodate non-native speakers. That  aside, yes. I’d say I understood around 90% or more of what Colombian locals said to me during this trip. Success!

I only started using DS in late February 2023 and I could understand 90% of what people were saying. That’s pretty good!

Keep in mind that some of these issues - my pronunciation, forgetting words at times and occasionally not understanding - could be down to tiredness. I have a lot of students in Europe and had to teach lessons from midnight at times during this trip. Add to that not sleeping well for the first few days and I could have been a little off at times. An[ example of this](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1gzraew/that_time_when_i_had_to_fight_my_brain_to_speak/) is that one of the conversations I had with an Uber driver was a mix of English and Spanish. I was simply too tired to function in the latter and I did intend on using English with him. However, Spanish kept coming out as I tried to speak English. Make of that what you will.

**Being white in Colombia**  
There’s obviously nothing wrong with being white in Colombia. Local people often look somewhat white and basically every skin tone exists in Colombia. However, there’s a “local white” and white foreigners are *very* obvious. I point this out not to dissuade anyone from going, but some people may assume that you don’t speak Spanish based on the colour of your skin. Conversations may begin in English in more touristy areas and you’ll need to politely insist on people speaking Spanish. We all harbour assumptions about people, so just be confident.

I met a French-born woman in Cartagena and she described an experience of the city that was dramatically different to mine. Why? She’s white. There could have been other factors, but I think it largely boiled down to that. She said that people assumed she didn’t speak the language and she felt overwhelmed by people trying to sell her things all the time. Anyway, this woman’s Spanish level was a little below mine, but she could certainly get by.

As well as the above, said she got ripped off a lot in the capital and in Cartagena. Your mileage will vary and may partly depend on your skin tone and accent.

**“Tourist camouflage”**  
Being of mixed ethnicity and looking somewhat brown is honestly a blessing in Colombia. I was asked for my zone number - which all locals are expected to provide when they pay at supermarkets and such - almost every single time I encountered a new cashier. I started referring to it as tourist camouflage, because *almost* all local people seemed to have no idea I was Western. Until I opened my mouth.

My host in Popayán said to me that her husband told her “there are no gringos here” when trying to find me; the address wasn’t correct on Airbnb when I arrived.

**Being misunderstood**  
Although my pronunciation has improved a *lot*, I'm still misunderstood at times. I used to screw up the pronunciation of i and e in Spanish a *lot*. I also sometimes pronounce sounds as I would in English. In other words, subconsciously combining letters, rather than pronouncing each letter individually. I’ve been working on both of those things and they were less of an issue at the end of the trip than it was at the start. I also almost universally refuse to use Google Translate during face-to-face conversations. I’d rather screw up in the moment and mentally chastise myself when I remember the correct word later.

**Taxis in Spain versus Colombia**  
I talked a little bit with my Uber driver on the way from Madrid airport to my hostel. It was better than when I had to do the same during the last trip. It was pretty similar with my Bolt driver from the hostel back to Madrid airport in the morning. However, the Uber from Bogotá airport to my first Airbnb in the city was *so* much better. He spoke close to zero English and we talked for almost all of the 20-minute drive. We covered where I'm from, that I'd been here before, where I went before and where I was going to go this time. Why I adore Colombia, the fact he doesn't really like the capital and would prefer to live in a small town. Accents in Colombia versus other Spanish speaking countries and some other stuff. I couldn’t think of one word in Spanish at the time and I couldn’t think of one conjugation. In my defence, I’d slept for about 3 hours the night before and for about 1 hour on the 10-hour flight I’d just departed. Why would I sleep when quiet time on a plane means hours of extra input from podcasts and downloaded YouTube videos? Exactly, I wouldn’t.

My record was a 50-minute conversation with an Uber driver to Medellín’s international airport. I talked with the driver about the usual things - where I was from, why I loved the country and Spanish from Colombia etc - as well as what I do and that he wanted to improve his English. I told him to start with cartoons for very young children and to go from there. 

I believe I had to think of ways to work around 3 words I couldn't remember in the moment and I corrected my own conjugations a few times. He kindly corrected me 2 or 3 times in terms of the latter, too. I'm definitely getting better at knowing when I've made a mistake.

Not taking public transport from or to airports and 15 flights meant I spoke with a *lot* of Uber drivers. Most of the interactions went smoothly. I probably used Uber 12 times in Pereira alone because it's hilly and I was lazy. I think I took 40 to 50 Uber journeys in Colombia this time. I spoke to most of the drivers and only recall two challenging accents out of all of them. I was generally pleased with these interactions and they probably averaged around 15 minutes each.

**Compliments & improvements during this trip**  
I received zero compliments on my Spanish during my first trip to Colombia. I absolutely got some this time, though. It honestly felt like I received compliments on a near-daily basis during the last two weeks of the trip. They were generally about the fluidity of my speaking or my correct use of present perfect conjugations.

I’m sure - just as during my last trip - that my Spanish benefited greatly from being in Colombia for 11 weeks. It’s not just hearing the language on a daily basis, either. My brain was slow to understand real-world usage of reflexives. It just clicked one day in late January and I’m confident that frequently seeing signs that used them radically sped up the process.

[One of my biggest achievements](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1i5clx2/a_small_pronunciation_victory/) during the trip may seem small. However, the English vs Spanish pronunciation of I and E has been a big problem for a long time. The difference is subtle, but completely changes a person’s understanding, as in the example I cited. I know I still have a *lot* to learn when it comes to Spanish and that my pronunciation in general is far from perfect. However, being corrected a lot has helped.

I could feel my conjugations improve in the final 10 days or so of the trip. The specific constructions for the equivalent of things like “I have had too much caffeine today” just started to flow naturally.

Another positive thing I noticed is that far fewer people automatically realised that I was from the UK this time. This was especially apparent in the last ten days or so of the trip. I asked my teacher about my accent and she said that it’s improved since our initial lessons. I automatically started to produce a somewhat natural sounding Colombian single r sound soon after I changed my input to almost 100% Colombian Spanish at around 2,000 hours. I suppose I should have expected my accent to change after that and spending so much time in the country. I’m not at all displeased! This, to me, is another vindication of my choice to focus on Colombian Spanish. While I’ll likely never sound like a Colombian to Colombians, not sounding like a gringo would be nice and would enhance my tourist camouflage 🙂

As [per this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ie1qju/bogot%C3%A1_the_compliments_i_waited_10_weeks_to_hear/), I was complimented a *lot* by my hosts in the capital with whom I’d stayed before. I was waiting the whole trip for that.

**My biggest wins this trip**  
I could say that I was most pleased with my pronunciation of arepas. That single moment demonstrated that my efforts - and that of my teacher - had paid off. However, I think my confidence and comfort are at least as big of a deal.

Looking at my [post history](https://www.reddit.com/user/agentrandom/submitted/), you’ll see that I was very confident this time. I could never, for instance, have confidently [corrected a sales assistant](https://www.reddit.com/r/dreamingspanish/comments/1ibq9jy/i_bought_a_phone_in_colombia_and_called_out_the/) on technical issues regarding a phone’s software updates last time. Additionally, all the Airbnb messages I sent before and during the last trip were in English. Everything I sent was in Spanish this time and 95% of it was written by me. I remember just about *kind of* managing to deal with a delivery guy last time. I dealt with neighbours and multiple delivery people with no issues at all this time. Including one who seemed to be trying to steal from my hosts. He essentially said that he left something at the property. I said I couldn’t give anyone anything without their permission. I was later told that was the right thing to do. It sounds simple, but I would have been lost and confused in that situation during the previous trip.

I didn’t simply go to restaurants (with written menus) and cafes this time, as was the case during the March trip. I interacted with more local people, spoke confidently and fluently with 40+ Uber drivers, ate and shopped at lots of small businesses and had longer conversations on a plethora of subjects with more Airbnb hosts in different cities than last time. To say that I’m pleased with this amount of progress after 6 months would be an understatement.

**I'm pleased**  
This may seem slow or insufficient progress to a lot of you after around 3,000 hours of listening. As I’ve said in other posts, I have two types of autism and was diagnosed with learning difficulties as a child. In fact, my mother was once told by an expert to not expect me to ever speak. English. Given that, I’m pleased with my current level of speaking in Spanish.

**The way back**  
The trip back from Colombia was essentially a flight from Bogotá to Barcelona, then one to Bristol and road travel. The flight to the UK was in a different terminal, so I went through passport control in two different buildings. This wasn't a big deal and it was probably less than two minutes, but I liked that those interactions were solely in Spanish. I don't want to be one of those lazy Bits in Spain.

**Goals for my next trip**  
I already have my main flights and some accommodation booked for mid-August to early November. I’m very confident I’ll have reached 4,000 hours of input by the time the trip starts. I’ve been told by my teacher that it should take me between 5 and 8 months to reach a B2 speaking level with my current level of input, lessons and general commitment. Thus, my goal is to be close to a B2 by the start of the next trip and to reach that B2 milestone while in Colombia.

I intend on visiting some of the main cities I’ve not yet experienced, such as Cali. I’ve booked accommodation with some of the same hosts, so I can repeat the same approach to benchmark/check my speaking progress. You’ll hear all about my wins during the trip and there will be a detailed report like this when it ends.

**Finally, well done if you read the whole thing!**  
It was long, even by my standards. Reddit’s character limit for a post is 40,000 and I wasn't far off. It took many hours of 30 minutes here and there during the trip to write and edit, so I hope someone benefited from it. I’ll do my best to answer related questions if you have them.",6,1738857171.0,dreamingspanish,0,1.0,False

it’s crucial to take steps to safeguard your anonymity. Here are actionable measures to protect your privacy when contributing to Wikipedia:

1. **Create a Unique Username**: Choose a username that doesn’t reveal personal information. Utilize online username generators to help you select a random, non-identifiable alias.
2. **Use a Dedicated Anonymous Email**: Register an email account solely for Wikipedia activities. Services like ProtonMail and Tutanota offer free, secure email accounts that don’t require personal details.
3. **Avoid Reusing Credentials**: Ensure that your Wikipedia username and email are unique and not used elsewhere. This minimizes the risk of cross-referencing by potential trackers.
4. **Edit from Public Locations**: Perform your Wikipedia edits from public places like coffee shops, libraries, or restaurants. Avoid editing from home or work to prevent your personal IP address from being logged.
5. **Employ a Virtual Private Network (VPN)**: A VPN masks your real IP address by routing your internet connection through a different server, enhancing your online anonymity.
6. **Use Privacy-Focused Browsers and Extensions**: Opt for browsers like Firefox, which offer robust privacy features. Enhance your browser’s privacy by installing extensions such as:
   * **uBlock Origin**: Blocks unwanted content and trackers.
   * **Privacy Badger**: Automatically detects and blocks tracking attempts.
   * **Ghostery**: Provides insights into trackers on websites and allows you to block them.
7. **Prevent Device Fingerprinting**: Device fingerprinting collects various data points to identify users uniquely. Fingerprinting gathers information like your IP address, browser plugins, time zone, installed fonts, timestamp, Flash data, HTTP request headers, Silverlight data, user-agent string, and mime-types to create a digital profile that can track you even without cookies.
   * **Use Browser Extensions**: Install tools like Canvas Blocker or Trace to obscure or block fingerprinting attempts.
   * **Adjust Browser Settings**: Configure your browser to resist fingerprinting by modifying settings related to privacy and security.
8. **Opt-Out of Data Broker Listings**: Data brokers collect and sell personal information, which can be used to identify you. Regularly check and remove your data from such listings.  Use websites like (or look around on Reddit for the best sites to remove your information from data brokers:
   * **DeleteMe**
   * **Privacy Bee**
   * **Optery**
   * **OneRep**
   * **Kanary**
9. **Be Mindful of Content**: When editing, avoid adding personal anecdotes or information that could be traced back to you. **Always** stick to verifiable information and cite credible sources.
10. **Stay Informed**: Keep abreast of privacy news and updates. Engage with communities that focus on digital privacy to learn about new tools and strategies.

By implementing these steps, you can significantly enhance your privacy and continue contributing to Wikipedia without compromising your anonymity.

I spend most of my days at home hanging out with the cats, one of whom loves to play fetch. I've loved art ever since I was very young. I have huge ambitions to have my own graphic design gig some day, but right now I don't currently work at all.

I love video games. I got a lot to play on. PS5, Xbox One, Switch, Meta Quest 2, and my iPad. So, like, pretty much everything but PC 😅 I'm an achievements/trophy hunter. I also collect PS1 & 2 games to play on my PlayStation 2. In recent years I've been very casual with my gaming, playing a lot of platformers and survival/crafting games. I'll play a bit of everything, though, except for, like, sports games.

I love tabletop games. Star Wars Legion, Warhammer 40K/AoS, Magic: The Gathering, Pokémon TCG, Digimon TCG, Lorcana, and Star Wars Unlimited. I love to paint miniatures as well, but it's a bit of a struggle to actually get people to play with me. Never really gotten the chance to play any TTRPGs, but would love to.

I suffer from a bit of learning curve. Certified dyslexic.

I love music. Dance Gavin Dance, Papa Roach, Twenty-One Pilots, A Day To Remember, stuff like that. Bit of an elder emo. I wish I could play an instrument, but I fear I may be tone deaf 🙃

I love Marvel. Spider-Man's probably my favorite. Though in recent years I've been growing to appreciate DC a lot more than I did before.

I love Harry Potter. Pretty sure my house is Hufflepuff.

Huge fan of The Office (US). I've seen the whole series countless times.

I love horror movies and got into true crime on YouTube a few years ago. My favorite horror movie is The Blair Witch Project, second to the 2003 Texas Chainsaw Massacre.

I love anime and manga. Demon Slayer is by far my favorite. I also really love Fullmetal Alchemist, Attack on Titan, Digimon, Dragon Ball, Dandadan, and Sword Art Online.

I'm doin' the Japanese, Spanish, and music courses on Duolingo right now.

I love baking, coffee, and grilling. I don't have too much confidence in my cooking skills 😅 But I'm trying new recipes all the time and I've been getting better! I'm rather adept at baking though, and I love smoked meats 🤤

https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/UO7m99sfW6

My husband’s getting drinks with a coworker and I’m terrified.

My husband (35M) and I (34F) have been together for nine years, married for five. He was showing me a video on his phone the other day and a text came through from a female name I didn’t recognize. I asked who it was and he said she’s a colleague from a company that his company works closely with. He has text previews turned off so I couldn’t actually see what was said but my suspicions were raised. 

I know it’s wrong but when he was in the shower that evening I looked through his phone to see who this girl is and why she’s texting him. I found out that they’ve been getting coffee and lunch during the workday, sometimes to talk about work, sometimes not. Prior to last week, it was maybe once a month communications to plan these, but then she joined a board that he’s on last week. So they had a board meeting and then seemed to go out as a group for drinks after until about 11. I did know that he was out with his colleagues during this time and wasn’t concerned. What is concerning is that he texted her that night making sure she got home safe and telling her how much fun he had but that he’d been hoping to have more opportunities to talk with her instead of everyone else. The next morning, he texted her good morning and asking her to drinks one on one next week. She agreed and he said he couldn’t wait.

Of course I looked her up and she’s a very beautiful woman, probably in her mid 20s.

I asked again later who she was and what their connection was. He reiterated that she’s a colleague and is helping get him connected with exciting opportunities in her organization. I know he’s been really focused on networking and she has a lot of high up community connections that it looks like she’s introduced him to. He’s also a friendly guy who likes to be involved, through board work and professional groups. I don’t want to go scorched earth and accuse him of anything inappropriate since my insecurity has been a major issue we’ve had to work through in the past but I’m terrified he’s going to cheat on me. Would this send off alarm bells for you and how would you respond without accusing him and ruining the marriage?

Update: https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/s/gfIc4uHYQZ

1/31/2025

UPDATE My husband’s getting drinks with his coworker and I’m terrified.

Well, you were all correct.

I continued to monitor his texts without saying anything and he continued to be flirty, texting her good morning, telling her how he couldn’t wait to see her, and how happy he was to hear from her throughout the day. 

They did go out for dinner and drinks the other night. It sounds like it must’ve gone well, since they’re now having flat out conversations to set the frame work for their affair. They’ve discussed that they want to keep things private and out of work, that she doesn’t like that he’s married, that they both have mutual feelings and are going to continue and are on the same page about everything, and that she initially didn’t want to start this but has developed feelings she can’t ignore, while my husband told her that he’s always had these feelings and couldn’t resist her. Not sure if anything physical happened, but I’m assuming it did. 

I thought I’d be heartbroken but now I’m just furious. I’m getting my affairs in order to confront him and end the marriage. 

Thanks for all the feedback and advice.

Teeth whitening can be an exciting journey towards a brighter, more confident smile. However, many people find themselves confused about what they can and cannot eat immediately after the procedure. One common question that emerges is whether lettuce is safe to consume post-teeth whitening. Understanding the dos and don'ts of your diet after teeth whitening is crucial to maintaining those stunning results and protecting your newly brightened smile.

Understanding Teeth Whitening and Dietary Restrictions

Teeth whitening temporarily increases the porosity of your tooth enamel, making your teeth more susceptible to staining and sensitivity. During this critical recovery period, your diet plays a significant role in preserving the whitening effects and preventing potential complications. The first 24-48 hours after teeth whitening are particularly important for maintaining your results.

Is Lettuce Safe After Teeth Whitening?

Good news for salad lovers! **Lettuce is generally considered a safe food to eat after teeth whitening**. Unlike dark-colored or highly pigmented foods, lettuce is a light-colored vegetable that is unlikely to cause staining or significant discomfort. However, there are some important considerations to keep in mind:

1. Opt for lighter-colored lettuce varieties
2. Ensure the lettuce is clean and free from strong dressings
3. Eat at a comfortable temperature

Potential Risks to Consider

While lettuce itself is relatively safe, there are some potential risks to be aware of:

• Temperature sensitivity
• Potential irritation from acidic dressings
• Rough handling of sensitive teeth

Recommended Lettuce Consumption After Teeth Whitening

For the best results, follow these guidelines when eating lettuce after teeth whitening:

1. Wait at least 24-48 hours before consuming
2. Choose mild, light-colored lettuce varieties
3. Avoid heavy dressings
4. Cut into small, easily manageable pieces
5. Eat at room temperature

Foods to Avoid After Teeth Whitening

While lettuce is generally safe, some foods can compromise your whitening results:

• Dark-colored beverages (coffee, red wine)
• Highly pigmented foods (berries, tomato sauce)
• Acidic foods and drinks
• Extremely hot or cold items

Maintaining Your Bright Smile

Proper care after teeth whitening goes beyond just diet. Consider these additional tips:

• Use a straw when drinking
• Practice excellent oral hygiene
• Stay hydrated
• Follow your dentist's specific recommendations

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Professional Recommendations

Dental professionals typically advise patients to follow a ""white diet"" for the first 48 hours after teeth whitening. This means consuming foods and drinks that are white or light in color. Lettuce fits perfectly into this dietary guideline, making it an excellent choice for those looking to maintain their newly whitened smile.

Potential Complications and When to Seek Help

Most people experience minimal issues after teeth whitening. However, if you notice the following, consult your dentist:

• Extreme sensitivity
• Persistent discomfort
• Unexpected changes in tooth color
• Unusual reactions after eating

Click here to learn more: https://prodentim.myofferdeals.com

Hydration and Oral Care

Staying hydrated is crucial after teeth whitening. Water helps rinse away potential staining agents and supports overall oral health. When consuming lettuce or any other food, remember to drink water and maintain gentle oral hygiene practices.

Conclusion

Understanding your dietary choices after teeth whitening is essential for maintaining those brilliant results. Lettuce emerges as a safe, nutritious option that can be enjoyed with minimal risk to your newly whitened teeth. By following professional guidelines and being mindful of your diet, you can preserve your bright smile while continuing to enjoy delicious, healthy foods like fresh, crisp lettuce.",1,1738856742.0,Teethgumhealth,0,1.0,False
1ij5isw,https://www.reddit.com/r/Microbiome/comments/1ij5isw/gut_microbiome_essentials/,Gut Microbiome Essentials,"I recently consolidated all my thoughts on the essentials of gut microbiome development. Feel like a lot of people get lost in the weeds instead of focusing on the fundamentals. Here are my notes.



1. Probiotic Supplements  
Why experts recommend them:  
\- Probiotics are live microorganisms (commonly bacteria such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium) that can confer a health benefit when taken in adequate amounts.  
\- They may help rebalance an imbalanced gut by crowding out undesirable microbes, supporting the gut barrier, and modulating the immune system.

What to look for:  
\- Clinically studied strains: Not all probiotics are created equal. Look for products that list strain specificity (e.g., Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis BB-12, etc.) with evidence in published studies.  
\- Adequate CFU (colony-forming units): Most experts recommend at least 1–10 billion CFU per serving, but optimal dose varies by strain and health goal.  
\- Quality and storage: Choose reputable brands that ensure viability through manufacturing and storage.

  
2. Prebiotic Fiber Supplements  
Why experts recommend them:  
\- Prebiotics are types of fiber (e.g., inulin, fructooligosaccharides \[FOS\], galactooligosaccharides \[GOS\]) and other non-digestible carbohydrates that feed beneficial microbes in the colon.  
\- They selectively stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacteria and Lactobacilli, leading to improved short-chain fatty acid production and better overall gut health.

What to look for:  
\- Inulin, FOS, GOS: Common, well-studied prebiotics often found in foods like chicory root, garlic, onion, and artichokes.  
\- Partially hydrolyzed guar gum (PHGG): A gentler prebiotic fiber that some find more tolerable if they’re prone to gas/bloating.  
\- Dose and tolerance: Some people experience bloating or GI discomfort as they adjust, so it’s wise to start with a lower dose and gradually increase.

  
3. Synbiotics (Probiotic + Prebiotic Combination)  
Why experts recommend them:  
\- A “synbiotic” is a combination of probiotics and prebiotics in one product. The idea is to supply beneficial microbes along with the fuel they need to flourish.  
\- Some leading researchers find that combining targeted probiotic strains with carefully selected prebiotics can yield synergistic effects—essentially giving the “good bugs” a head start.

What to look for:  
\- Match of strain + prebiotic substrate: The prebiotic component should specifically enhance the viability and activity of the probiotic strains included.  
\- Evidence-based formulations: Because the synbiotic space can be marketing-heavy, look for brands or formulations tested in clinical trials.

  
4. Omega-3 Fatty Acids (Fish Oil or Algae-Based)  
Why experts recommend them:  
\- While omega-3s are often discussed for heart, brain, and anti-inflammatory benefits, emerging studies indicate they may positively influence the gut microbiome by modulating inflammation in the gut environment.  
\- Higher omega-3 intake is associated with increased diversity of certain beneficial microbes.

What to look for:  
\- High-quality, purified supplement: Ensures minimal heavy metals and contaminants.  
EPA + DHA content: Check labels for the amount of these two primary omega-3 fatty acids per serving.  
\- Algal oil for plant-based options: Algae-based sources also provide EPA/DHA and avoid fish allergens.

  
5. Polyphenol-Based Supplements  
Why experts recommend them:  
\- Polyphenols—naturally occurring compounds found in fruits, vegetables, teas, coffee, chocolate, and herbs—are metabolized by gut bacteria into beneficial bioactive molecules.  
\- Certain polyphenol extracts (e.g., green tea extract, grape seed extract, pomegranate extract) have been linked to favorable shifts in microbiome composition and reduced markers of gut inflammation.

What to look for:  
\- Standardized extracts: Look for products with standardized levels of key polyphenols or catechins (in the case of green tea).  
\- Dietary sources first: Many experts emphasize getting polyphenols from whole foods. If supplementing, be mindful of dosage to avoid excessive intake.

  
Other Key Considerations from Gut Microbiome Experts  
\- Diet and Lifestyle First: Almost every gut microbiome researcher—from Dr. Rob Knight to Dr. Tim Spector—emphasizes that no supplement can compensate for an overall poor diet (low in fiber, high in ultra-processed foods) or chronic stress. A varied, fiber-rich diet with plenty of plant-based foods is foundational.  
\- Personalization Matters: Your microbiome is unique. What works well for one person may not be optimal for another. Tools like microbiome sequencing or working with a knowledgeable practitioner can help tailor recommendations.  
\- Slow and Gradual Introduction: Increasing fiber or adding new probiotics too quickly can cause temporary GI discomfort. A common expert tip is to introduce one supplement at a time and titrate slowly.  
\- Quality Over Quantity: If you decide to try supplements, focus on reputable brands, third-party testing, and clear labeling. Experts caution that the supplement market is not equally regulated in all regions.  
\- Long-Term Consistency: Supporting the gut microbiome isn’t about quick fixes; it’s about sustained changes. Supplements can be helpful tools but typically work best alongside healthy habits (balanced diet, good sleep, stress management, and regular exercise).",1,1738856707.0,Microbiome,0,1.0,False

I enjoy an occasional espresso-based drink at a coffee shop or a restaurant; at home I use a french press to managed an okay cup for myself, although I have a shitty grinder so the results are inconsistent. I found that the tastiest coffee I drink is when someone else does a manual pourover for me. I really don't want to learn right now the intricacies of the manual method, and started looking at automatic brewers that claim to mimic the manual pourover method. It seems that everything from the Fellow Aiden, to Ratio 8/6, to Balmuda and others that claim to be pour over have a kind of showerhead mechanism, which to me seems more like a drip coffee. Only the xBloom, that I found, has that single spout that moves around mechanicaly (or magnetically I suppose on the Original), which resembles the manual pourover.

We boys were cursed with ignorance on the matter of sex.

Then when I was in 6th grade my dad gave me ‘the talk’ because my mother heard me call my younger sister a whore.  I had no idea what a whore was, but I heard my old man call my mother a whore almost on a daily basis, so I thought that it was just a good insult to yell at any female, my 4th grade sister (who was obviously not a whore) included.

My dad had been drinking wine that day with the neighbor, Phil.  I still don’t understand the urgency, but my dad wanted to get it done immediately.  He told me to sit on the couch in our living room while he sat in a recliner facing away from me, as he furiously jumped channels with the remote.  My dad was probably giving the situation about 20%-30% of his overall attention, which was dismal because he didn’t have a whole lot of mental capacity to throw around to begin with.  Most of the father-son, heart-to-heart discussions that my father and I had up to that point involved a beating, threats to break both of my hands, or his aspirations to kick me out of the car in the middle of the desert.  There was not a lot of warmth to our relationship.

My dad opened the discussion with, “your mom told me that I need to tell you about the sex stuff.  What do you know?”  I told him that Mike, a neighbor kid who was two years older than me ( and completely ignorant of the female anatomy) had already filled me in on human reproduction.  My dad turned off the tv, threw the remote on the coffee table and said, “good.” Then got up and went back to Phil’s house to continue drinking.

We are a small office of 5, I am the youngest. The second youngest is 12 years older than I am. After that, my coworkers are ancient. 

We have a receptionist. Her only job is to answer the 4-8 phone calls, greet clients as they enter, and turn the coffee pot on. 

I noticed last week that every time she sends me an email about a client needing to get ahold of me, she will also send a text to let me know she is sending an email. If I don't respond to the text, she will text again to confirm I received her first text AND the email. I politely explained yesterday that the emails come across my laptop immediately, as I always have my emails up. She was offended by me suggesting I don't need her texts and sent a message back saying we must have ""a full circle of communication"" if I am not in the office. 

Today I came in and our boss asked to speak to me. He spoke to me as if I'm this rebelling teenager instead of a woman in her late 20s. Basically, he is wanting me to do this because he will please her.

1ij57oh,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1ij57oh/struggling_with_some_feelings_after_group_time_w/,Struggling with some feelings after group time w meta,"Hi all,

I'm hoping that I can get some perspective from folks experienced in non monogamy to help me figure out how to talk to my partner and express my sense of feeling my needs be neglected when my partner (Al), Al's partner Bob(my meta) and I all have group time.

Some context, Al and I have been dating for about 3 years. Al and Bob have been dating for about 2 years. We all have a sweet vibe and chemistry when we are all hangin gout together, and our hangs typically result in us having a cuddle party all together, sexual group play and sleeping all three of us together in the same bed. We have done this maybe... 3 times total. The first time was really hard for Al. The second time was the best and easiest time for all 3 of us. And this time was really hard for me. Added context is that I see A. pretty frequently, and the past week, Al had been over my place almost everyday because they were ill and needing support and so I was cooking and providing them with meals and cuddles. Al and Bob don't see each other as frequently.

**So what happened...**

So I had a big career achievement happen on Friday and I wanted to celebrate it. Originally my plan was to go with Al to a hot spring a few hours away for a little relaxation after all of the work that I put in for the last three months to get my certification. Al let me know that Bob had invited them to go dancing, and that Bob also invited me. Al expressed that the two of them ""want to celebrate"" my accomplishment. Al asks if I want to invite Bob to the day trip, and I express yes since we're going out the night before anyway all together and I do enjoy spending time all three of us and thought it would be a cute and fun way to prepare for us all spending more time together as we have a summer trip planned for the three of us that's for about a week.

Saturday night happens and we have fun and do our usual thing.

On Sunday, when we wake up we have some morning fun and we all cuddle together but I start feeling this odd sensation of neglect and yearning when Al and Bob are laying on my chest and carressing each other's face, lost in each others' eyes. I lay there watching the two of them doing this for a bit and then I peck the two of them on the forehead because I wanted to express affection to them too. Bob returns this and Al, my actual partner, doesn't really return it. Later on, the two of them beg me to make coffee for the three of us and I ask them not to because I made it last time but they make a big show of it. When I come back the two of them are cuddled up very cutesy and I deliver them coffee. We drink coffee all together and cuddle, then eventually have some morning fun.

We later go to brunch and Al sits with Bob across from me and the entire brunch is them making jokes towards each other in their common language, people watching behind me (I'm facing a wall), holding each others'hands and rubbing each others' thighs under the table. I'm trying to feel included but my comprehension of their language isn't great, and I can't hear very well in the restaurant. Al every now and then will reach across and touch my hand and hold it briefly when they notice me spacing out, but otherwise I'm just sort of sitting there eating my brunch while they do their thing.

When we get back to my place, we sit on the couch and relax. But eventually I do notice how much Al is reaching over to touch Bob and play with Bob and do all these other things but not really reaching to touch me. Bob and I wrestle a little and we start a massage train, and have some fun, you know how that goes. But I have this aching sensation throughout the rest of the day where I just keep noticing the chemistry between Al and Bob, and how Al continues to reach for and cuddle, carress, look deeply into the eyes of Bob and squeal and giggle when Bob kisses them. When I attempt similar... I don't get the same results, despite the fact that when Al and I are alone just the two of us... they squeal, joke, cuddle, carress, look longingly in my eyes, etc...

After we drop Bob off at the train station, I go to Al's house and we watch a tv show we love together and cuddle and that is when I finally get the type and kind of attention that I was wanting all weekend from them.

I want to express to them that I felt neglected and like my needs for touch and attention weren't being met. I understand that parts of this have much to do with my own insecurity, with my own inability to name my needs (I would sigh a lot during the day and Al would ask what's up but I was afraid to say how I felt because I haven't been emotionally vulnerable in front of Bob like that), and I also wish my partner had made some effort to make me feel special, included, loved and appreciated especially since they had shared they wanted to celebrate me.

Has anyone else had a similar situation where they're having group time with their partner and their meta and felt a bit neglected? How did your partner react when you shared this?

I'm definitely newer to non monog than the two of them, so that's where my hesitancies come from partly.",2,1738855909.0,polyamory,6,1.0,False

I don‘t like beer anymore, not a terrible loss but I might miss cracking open a cold one once in a while. It‘s not tasting completely terrible, but not great either. 

White bread is still icky, but whole grain is good to go.

Self-made fries in the air fryer are fine, fries from fast food joints are still shit.

Peanut butter is back in the menu! Nutella or similar things still taste and smell like puke.

I don‘t like bananas anymore. Other fruit is usually fine. 

90% of energy drinks taste like shit, but that’s probably better for my health anyway. If I need a little kick, I have found the Holy Energy powder-based products available in some European countries to be an exception.

1ij5373,https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1ij5373/if_you_could_rewrite_zaynes_cafe_lines/,If you could rewrite Zayne's cafe lines...,"Another user brought up discussion about some of [Zayne's translations](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1iiuzff/can_we_get_a_better_translation_for_zayne/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), so I wanted to bring up a related topic. Some of the LIs' lines are phrased awkwardly or simply baffle me, especially Zayne's in Destiny Cafe and some of his text messages. (That said, I’ve noticed the writing in Abyssal Chaos and the limited events tends to be smoother. I suspect different interpreters might be involved.)

From what I understand, MC sometimes behaves in a [sajiao manner](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1bb2foo/comment/kubg78y/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) (think Rafayel’s playful whining toward MC) when interacting with Zayne, which sets the tone for his responses in Destiny Cafe. However, since we don’t actually see how MC is acting or what she’s saying, some of Zayne’s lines can come off as overly strict or even unintentionally dismissive, especially for players with different personalities who self-insert.

Take, for example, this gem:

* ""While companionship is important, people shouldn’t be glued to each other 24/7."" (He sometimes says this the moment you log in for the first time of the day.)

Or this rollercoaster of mixed signals:

* He tells you to ""come closer."" But when you do and zoom in on his stoic azz, he suddenly hits you with: ""No need to come this close. I can see your face just fine."" 😤

I suspect some of these lines are meant to showcase his famous [dry humor](https://www.reddit.com/r/LoveAndDeepspace/comments/1bvpk4t/true_zayne_translation_before_workingstudying/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button), but the execution doesn’t quite land. Maybe it’s the wording, or maybe it’s the combination of his deadpan expression and delivery. Don’t get me wrong—I adore his VA, but sometimes, VAs don’t receive the right direction on how to deliver their lines. But maybe I'm missing something, and it's intended for Zayne to remain aloof in the cafe? Because if you've gone through his recent event stories and cards, he's distinctly more affectionate and playful, and I think the change has been ongoing for a while now.

So, here’s my question: If you could rewrite some of Zayne’s cafe lines, what would they be? What kind dry-humored responses would you like to see from him?

Some lines I can imagine:

**General greetings upon logging in:**

* ""Finally here. I was about to check for signs of life.""
* ""If you were a patient today, I'd have marked you as a no-show by now.""
* ""I see my favorite distraction has arrived."" (sips coffee if he's at his table)
* ""This many visits suggest a severe case of attachment. (small smile) Fortunately, I specialize in that.""

**When you tap him repeatedly:**

* ""Persistent. You remind me of a particularly stubborn virus.""
* ""You do realize I'm a doctor, not a stress ball, right?""
* ""If you're looking for a pulse, I assure you, I'm alive. And if you want yours checked... well, I could oblige.""
* ""You could at least bring me dessert if you're going to keep distracting me from work.""

**If you leave him alone too long:**

* ""I don't recall prescribing distance as a treatment plan.""
* ""Ignoring me? Hmm. I'd check your vitals, but I doubt heartbreak is fatal.""
* ""I assume you're plotting something troublesome, given this unusual silence.""
* ""I see you've finally learned to appreciate quiet time... how unexpected.""

**Random sass:**

* “If you’re looking for a remedy to your ‘Zayne addiction,’ I have bad news... It’s incurable.”
* ""You seem very invested in my well-being. What's the prognosis, Doc-tor?""",7,1738855580.0,LoveAndDeepspace,3,1.0,False

I used to work at this office for years that I didn't really fit in personally. It was in my field, but my background was a lot more blue-collar than most of the folks that worked there. In fact, despite my degree I got hired in a facilities position and had to fight tooth and nail to get into a technical role that matched my degrees. While there I made very few friends due to most of the staff being standoffish whenever I was around. Despite this I found myself a little group and we would go get coffee every Friday. 

In this group there was Laura, Jack, and Janet. Janet and I met in grad school and somehow ended up at the same agency. She immediately got hired in a technical role a year or 2 after i was hired. Jack worked in IT so I interacted with him frequently. Laura was in HR. Not really sure how we became friends, but I thought we were pretty tight. 

Well over the next 10 years or so we have this weekly coffee club and things are cool. Other days of the week, Laura, janet and I do lunch walks or get coffee in the morning and talk. Laura and me talked constantly. Like we'd always be the ones hanging  out together at agency functions or trainings. Janet had little kids so she would miss work more than us so a lot of time it was just me and Laura. At one point we used the gym together each morning as each other's accountability partner. 

I'm sure that other folks there thought we were sleeping together. I'm sure some of that was straight jealousy. Laura is exactly what people think of when they say western standards of beauty. Tall, blonde, very pretty. I will admit that I was attracted to her, but crossing that line was not a part of the friendship for me. I'm married, my wife has met her, likes her, and while she said she doesn't 'get' our friendship she supported it. We went to her wedding. Her husband and me get along. From our perspective it was clearly a friendship regardless what coworkers thought. 

Fast forward to covid. Jack has already taken another job so we don't do the whole group thing as frequently. Pandemic happens and after, since we don't go into the office as much, communication slows down. I have kids, you know, life happened. At one point I start feeling a bigger divide between myself and the others. When the protests  started Laura reached out to see how I was doing but the others...well it was more like how it always is for black folk. I started to distance myself from the group. Comm. between me and Laura fall off just because of life and I get a job that is better for me mentally. (I miss the money, though)

I confide in Laura that I'm feeling disconnected from the others and I am going to pull back more. She says she gets it. Over the next few years we talk less. I have my 2nd kid and she has her 1st. They are close in age so I thought we would get them together but that just doesn't happen. I initiate text and she may respond or not. She will respond to the group chat. I start to feel that if I don't meet up with the group I don't get to see her so that happens a couple of times. It goes...fine. I don't have anything in common with the others anymore. She does. 

I'm tired of being the one to reach out. But I want to be there as a friend since all the nuttiness happening in DC is directly affecting her. But I feel like it's not being received. I don't know. Maybe this friendship has just run its course. ",3,1738855048.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False

For me it’s incredibly frustrating! At work, I estimate how long a task will take me and I often find I’m achieving it far quicker than anticipated. Often I think so much time has passed I begin to get uncomfortable that I’m taking too long, only to discover I’ve actually completed it quite quickly. 

However when it comes to basic things like getting ready to leave the house… 

I can think about it, just for example, I can get up at x time and if I brush my teeth for 2 minutes, add an extra minute or so for the setup/cleanup, 5 min to make coffee, 2 min to take meds, 2 min to get changed, 3 minutes to grab my keys, etc and leave, that should be around 15 minutes. I leave an extra 5-10 minutes for distractions or morning confusion before the meds kick in, it means I have to get up at x time and I should be ready to leave within 25 minutes. 

But I can go brush my teeth for that 3 minutes and all of a sudden it’s been like 10?? I genuinely cannot understand how I can do all this stuff at work in such short time compared to others doing the same thing, yet suddenly with normal, everyday tasks that shouldn’t take long at all the time just seems to jump forward and it’s taken an absurd amount of time to do these things.

So I’m curious, how is everyone else’s perception of time? Is there anything you don’t understand yourself? are there certain things to struggle to keep track of time with? Just opening a casual 2am discussion as I procrastinate instead of going to bed haha. ",1,1738854932.0,ADHD,4,1.0,False

Right out of the box, the retro aesthetic of this aqua-colored coffee maker instantly grabbed my attention. It’s not just a coffee maker; it’s a statement piece that looks like it was plucked straight out of a 1950s diner. The design, while stunning, also feels sturdy, with its metallic finish adding a touch of durability. However, I did notice that the carafe feels a bit lightweight, which might not be ideal for heavy-handed users.

The brewing performance has been a mix of joy and mild frustration. Most mornings, it delivers a consistent and aromatic pot of coffee. The 12-cup capacity is perfect for hosting friends or fueling my caffeine-dependent weekdays. Its programmable feature, especially the 24-hour clock and delay timer, has been a lifesaver. Imagine setting it up the night before and waking up to the smell of fresh coffee—pure bliss. However, the pause-and-serve function could use a bit of improvement. While it’s convenient to grab a cup mid-brew, I’ve noticed a few drips escaping the anti-drip carafe, which can be annoying when you're in a rush.

Curious about Nostalgia RCOF12AQ’s cost? [Check it out on Amazon here.](https://tastefulcoffee.com/product-reviews/nostalgia-rcof12aq-review-with-b089zfn89f-details/)

When it comes to flavor, this machine doesn’t disappoint. The coffee is rich, smooth, and brewed at just the right temperature. I’m partial to a strong cup, and this machine delivers on that front. That said, the strength seems to rely heavily on the coffee grounds and water ratio, so a bit of experimentation is needed to get it just right.

Cleaning and maintenance are generally straightforward, thanks to the reusable filter and removable filter basket. These features not only make me feel a tad more eco-friendly but also save money in the long run. On the flip side, the warming plate has raised some concerns. After a few weeks of use, there’s a slight discoloration, and I’ve read reports of cracking over time. While I haven’t faced this yet, it’s something I’m keeping an eye on.

**Pros**

* Eye-catching retro design that doubles as decor.
* User-friendly programmable features for easy brewing.
* Produces smooth, flavorful coffee with a rich profile.
* Removable filter basket and reusable filter simplify cleaning.
* Two-hour keep-warm functionality for prolonged enjoyment.

**Cons**

* Anti-drip carafe isn’t entirely mess-proof.
* Reports of durability issues with the warming plate.
* Lightweight carafe may feel less premium.
* Timer requires double-checking to ensure it activates correctly.

**Comparison to Competitors**

Compared to the popular Smeg retro-style coffee maker, the Nostalgia RCOF12AQ holds its own in terms of aesthetics, but at a more wallet-friendly price point. While Smeg offers a slightly more premium build and a quieter operation, the Nostalgia coffee maker excels in programmability and brew strength. On the other hand, if you’re considering a modern competitor like the Hamilton Beach FlexBrew, you’ll get dual brewing options (single-serve and full pot), but the Nostalgia wins in the design department. However, brands like Cuisinart may outlast Nostalgia in terms of long-term durability.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**

This coffee maker falls in an affordable range for retro-style appliances, making it accessible for those on a budget. Its aesthetic alone justifies a portion of the cost, especially if you’re decorating a retro-themed kitchen. However, if you prioritize longevity and are wary of potential issues like the warming plate cracking, it might feel like a gamble. For casual use or as a decorative piece that occasionally brews, it’s worth considering.

The Nostalgia RCOF12AQ Retro Coffee Maker offers a lot of features: a programmable 24-hour clock, a delay timer, and the convenience of pause-and-serve. The keep-warm function is another plus, keeping your coffee hot for two hours. As a drip coffee machine tailored for ground coffee, it’s clear that Nostalgia aimed to deliver a product that doesn’t just look good but offers real utility. However, the durability concerns surrounding the warming plate and carafe might make heavy users think twice.

it all started after i (F28) gave birth on january 13th. I had nausea after every meal but i thought it was the postpartum hormones messing with my digestive system. I still indulged in lots fatty foods, a cup of wine, soft cheese, stuff i could not have during pregnancy. 

Then on the 24th i got up, made myself a cup of coffee and had a few sips. Thats when the attack hit me. The worst pain came on suddenly below my breast. I vomited and was heaving from the pain. I went straight to the ER where they diagnosed me with gallstones.
They sent me back home without any information they just said 'You will get a call eventually to get your gallblader removed'. I was scared to eat and drink about anything for the next few days. I was eating plain bread, skilmed milk, water and bananas. I felt so weak and tired. I was trying to take care of my baby but barely could because I was filled with so much health anxiety and lingering back pains. The 7th day after my first attack i felt sooo good. I thought i might be able to wait for the hospital to call me and schedule the surgery for later. That same day during my afternoon nap, i had a second attack.

I went back to the ER, I was devastated.
They ended up keeping me and i could not eat or drink anything before the surgery. I ended up waiting for the surgery for 2 days without eating. I thought i was going to die. Then 2 days ago it finally happened. 

The anesthesia went well, i woke up after what felt like a 15minutes nap. I was in lots of pain but it was tolerable. I was discharged 4 hours later. The first 24hours were painful, 7/10 but i did not want to use the opioid medication. The pain quickly went down to a 4/10 and today i would say its down to a 3.
I feel a bit weak and dizzy when i stand, im not sure if this is normal but i think so. Sleeping with my back elevated is the only way to not feel too much pain. 
I've finally regained my appetite too. Im slowly easing into my normal diet. Im still scared to eat some stuff...

Some virus, full-body muscle pain, I can barely move. This morning, around noon, I asked my boyfriend (m27) if he could grab some things for me..medicine, tissues, toilet paper. Only if he could, though. I didn’t demand anything. He said yes. I even asked again, “Are you sure?” and he was like, “Yeah, yeah.” So I thought, okay, great. I went back to sleep.

Then, around 3 PM, he calls me while already on his way to work (his shift starts at 4) and suddenly he’s overthinking everything. Saying stuff like, “I don’t know if I can make it,” and kind of debating with himself out loud. Like, bro. It’s just a pharmacy run. Max 30 minutes. And the thing is, I do so much for him when he’s sick. I always know exactly what meds he needs, I already have them at home, and if he ever needs anything, I go immediately. No hesitation. But now, the one time I need something, it’s suddenly this whole complicated mission?

Then he starts saying he’s not sure how to explain my situation at the pharmacy. That he might need to ask my doctor something, but he doesn’t know what to ask or how to say it. I tell him, he doesn’t need to say anything. He just has to show my health card. That’s literally it. The pharmacy already has everything on file. The doctor even told me not to leave the house, so there’s nothing to explain. He also isn’t sure if its rlly gonna take 30 mins or longer bc if its gonna take longer he will come late to work..I mean if that would’ve been an issue he should’ve left 10-15 mins earlier? I mean now he’s at work 30 mins early and drinking his coffee. But instead of just listening, he makes it seem like some impossible task.

Then, while already near my place, he asks if a friend of mine can do it instead. Like… what? I haven’t spoken to that person in forever, and now I should randomly text them like, “Hey, can you buy me some stuff because my boyfriend doesn’t feel like it?” That’s so weird. By the time he gets to my place, he hands me a mask and goes, “So, how do you wanna do this?” And at that point, I was just done. I said, “I’ll figure it out.” Because I hate feeling like I have to beg for basic help. And then he got annoyed. And then I got annoyed that he was annoyed. Bc honestly..why r u mad?? I hate being the one that has to always suck it up when he‘s mad.

And the absolute cherry on top? He says, “Just try standing up, try walking.” Bro. I can’t. That’s the whole reason I needed help in the first place. At this point, I don’t even know if I’m angry or just disappointed. Am I crazy for thinking this is messed up? AITA?",117,1738854354.0,AITAH,58,0.99,False

Bonus brownie points for you, if you know where that's from!

To give you due warning, this advert is pretty long. I suggest getting a cup of tea or coffee, and to make yourself comfortable!

So, where to begin? Why don't I begin with some basic introductions! I am a 23 year old roleplayer hailing from the dark, mysterious lands, also known as Eastern Europe. To be more specific, I come from Poland, which at the moment situates me in the CET time zone. I have been doing this hobby for about half my life at this point, and while I have only made a switch to English a couple years back, I still consider myself decent! Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I’ve been struggling with prostatitis for years, and while antibiotics helped at first, they were never a long-term solution. The symptoms kept coming back, and I tried everything—sports, supplements, diet changes, pelvic floor stretches, prostate massages, you name it.

Eventually, I started focusing on natural remedies that had anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. I tried garlic, honey (especially Manuka), onions, and ginger. While all of them helped a bit, the one that made a significant difference for me was ginger.

Here’s what worked for me:

1. **Ginger Water**: I grate fresh ginger into a cup, fill it with boiled water, and cover it with a plate overnight. The next morning, I drink it first thing. I also prepare another cup of ginger water in the evening, so I’m drinking it twice a day.
2. **Manuka Honey**: I take a dose of Manuka honey (1000+ MGO) daily trying to improve immune system overall.
3. **Fast Walking**: I walk at a brisk pace for 50-55 minutes (6.2 km) twice a week, keeping my heart rate between 140-150 bpm. This has really helped with overall blood circulation and managing the symptoms.
4. **Diet:** less alcohol, less meet, more fish, olive oils, more fresh vegetables, more fruits, less coffee, nuts, replaced white pasta and bread with whole grain, less butter and mayo.

For me, ginger was the main contributor to symptom relief. After incorporating these habits, I’ve noticed a huge improvement—my symptoms have pretty much disappeared.

I wanted to share this in hopes it could help others who are struggling with prostatitis. It’s been a game-changer for me, and I hope it helps someone else too.",8,1738854179.0,Prostatitis,3,1.0,False

Other than writing, be it solo- or collaborative, I also love tea, j-RPGs, anime, fantasy novels, as well as anything that happens to be furry and walks on four legs!

A very important thing to know about me is that I love a good OOC connection, and on my end, it's pretty much requirement!

Yes, it does mean that I wish to, eventually, befriend my writing partners! It is not just that, though. The thing is that the whole OOC chatter around the story, the fan-girling, discussing the what-ifs, laughing about it, making memes, even mocking tense and sad story moments are what makes half of the fun of the hobby for me! If all of this sounds like grueling nonsense to you, I can say with certainty that the two of us will not work together very well. If what I've said however sounds amazing, then that's great, and we may be able to create some wonderful magic together!

So, that's it as far as introductions! Before I carry on further, I must get a few things out of the way, first!

1. Please be at least 20 years old of age, or older.
2. I require a reply rate of at least **once** per day, and the ability to regularly post more often is appreciated as well as preferred. Real life always comes first, but if you know that what I've just asked for is going to be a problem, then I am not the right writing partner for you.
3. I write exclusively on Discord. At the moment, I am not interested in trying alternative sites.
4. I refuse to use face claims of any kind. That said, reference images for objects, buildings, weapons and monsters are something I am much more agreeable to!
5. Explicit content, the way the term is typically understood, is unlikely. I much prefer fade-to-black. If you message me from a dedicated NFSW account, you will be rejected on the spot no matter what.

Okay, that would be all! Now, why don't I actually move to my preferences so far as the actual roleplay is concerned?

So, the most important thing about me about a roleplayer is that I always, in a manner of speaking, come empty-handed. Why? That's simple! I want to come up with everything within the story, be it the plot, the characters, the lore, the entire world they're in, and pretty much everything else **together** with my writing partner! The main exception to that rule are mainly monsters and some other fantastical creatures, that I may, or may not outright steal from mythology, video games, DnD or other sorts of fiction! This isn't a perfect approach, and definitely not an approach that would work for everyone. Still, I do not believe in perfect, and that is what works for me!

Which also means that, no, I will not be very interested if you already have an intricate plot or world of your own. If you do, I wish you the absolute best with it, but that's just not what I am looking for!

Now, I have mentioned that I want to write a story in an urban fantasy... but what *is* urban fantasy to me?

Simple! By that I mean a world, where the existence of magic, and any possible fantastical elements, is not something hidden from the 'muggles', where it isn't considered inherently separate from technology, and instead, for both to often be combined, as well as intertwined together! Pretty much, what I want could be summed up with this sentence: imagine your traditional medieval fantasy world, and then imagine it's gone through an industrial revolution. Now, *how* advanced our possible world is, that is very much up to discussion! As long as it's at least reached the steam engine, I am more than happy to brainstorm and discuss!

I should mention that at least at the moment, I *really* do not want to write a medieval fantasy.

That said, I still tend to utilize a great deal of storytelling tropes and plot devices you would see in a medieval fantasy story. I just often put a more modern spin on them! My ideal story would still feature a ragtag group of companions that travel together from to town, while braving through dungeons, undergoing quests, interacting with a whole ensemble cast, facing many dangerous antagonists, while a greater, terrifying threat looms from over the horizon! Just like in many medieval fantasy epics. The thing is, I just want all that to happen in a world that has working trains, electricity, cars, supermarkets, and quite possibly social media! The actual tone and dominant themes are something that I would like to discuss together, but over-all, I just love epic fantasy with major stakes!

(Though, at the moment, I will not consider military and/or police settings as the main backdrop for the story!)

A thing I may want devote yet another paragraph on is action. I absolutely love action, and it's pretty much a requirement that my writing partners feel the same! That said, my approach to it is neither realistic nor grounded. To put it like this... while most of my characters wouldn't be any more than just cannon fodder in the very overpowered universes (like the Invincible or Dragon Ball), they would still be considered OP by the standards of grounded, realistic settings. Things such as swordsmen cutting through modern armed soldiers by the dozens, dodging and parrying of actual bullets, and characters that fight on in spite of grievous injuries are all par of the course! So, before you consider reaching, make sure that what I've just said is up your alley!

Now, as for the characters! I have already mentioned my love for ensemble casts, and for this reason, the ability to create characters that differ by age\*, gender, romantic orientation, social background, moral alignment, and more, is absolutely essential! Is it a tall order? Perhaps, but I promise the same on my end! When it comes to my lead character in particular, we'll see. The only thing that's certain is that she'll be a woman, which I also require for your own character. I also, generally speaking, prefer to write characters from their late 20s to their mid 30s. While playing young adults isn't necessarily off the table, I cannot promise I can be convinced to go down that road!

\*That said, most of the cast should be at least 21+ of age, if not 25+ outright.

As for romance, while I have a hard requirement for FxF for the main pairing, I still prefer writing partners willing and able to write all three basic gender combinations. By that I mean, obviously, FxM, MxM, and of course, FxF! Why? That's simple! I love variety, and I don't find it particularly realistic, nor immersive, when it's just a single kind of pairing over and over!

That said, while I do not outright require that our lead characters have to be romantically involved, I really am not the partner for you if you dislike writing romance in general.

I would also like to list some things that I do not want in my roleplays:

Fandoms, overt/excessive fluff/grimdark, sanitized/whitewashed depictions of groups widely known to be immoral/violent/corrupt, romanticized abuse, enemies-to-lovers (for the main pair), slice-of-life (as the main plot), werewolf and vampire plots, standard fantasy races, isekai, romance as the main plot, toxic masculine characters, comedy as the main genre, settings based off the real world (like in Marvel, HP or Percy Jackson), arranged marriage, school settings, protagonists of the evil moral alignment

Do not hesitate to ask, if you would like some elaboration on any one of these!

In truth, there's very, *very* few storytelling tropes and conventions that I refuse to make use of no matter what. Such as, I do not dislike either vampires, or were-creatures. I do, however, dislike settings where vampires and werewolves are the *only* fantastical elements, much less the only fantastical creatures, or if there's little of those besides them. Now that said, the ones listed above are what I *usually* dislike in fiction, and I figured the list may be useful to save at least some of you some time!

Now, while I **do not** write in fandoms anymore, there is a fair amount of fiction I tend to draw quite a lot of inspiration from! Examples would include:

Final Fantasy series (in particular VI, VII, X and XV), Fullmetal Alchemist (this is a big one!). Inuyasha, the Witcher series, Avatar: The Last Airbender (as well as Legend of Korra!), Vinland Saga, the Mistborn series, and Monster (the odd one out here!),

The list is in a *somewhat* descending order of importance. Of course, this isn't by any means the full extent of the fiction that I like! Absolutely not! I have, however, noticed that those are the pieces of fiction I am most likely to draw inspiration from, either on purpose, or subconsciously! If you like more than three positions on the list, then I feel there's good chance that we may vibe together quite well! However, I should say that while it is just my very limited personal experience, it's never worked out for me with anyone who was completely unfamiliar with any of the fandoms listed above. Especially when it comes to the first half of the list. So, if that's the case with you, approach at your own peril!

So! In regards to my storytelling preferences, I feel all that this should about suffice!

As for the *actual* writing, allow me to put it this way: I definitely like to have a decent amount of meat around the bone. Still, neither I do not believe in word quotas, nor do I believe in padding to fill said quotas. I don't really believe in labels all that much either, but if I must use one, then it'd be **advanced literate**. Typically, my replies tend to average between 400 and 800 words (don't ask me how much is it in paragraphs, I don't speak paragraph), but depending on the scene's need and scale, they can get longer. A lot longer. As for the more beautiful, flowery sort of language, I believe it is a lot like salt when used in cooking. Absolutely amazing in moderation, but not so much if you dump a whole kilogram into the pot! Oh, and I write exclusively in third person and past tense, and I expect the same of my partners, too.

I will happily provide a writing sample upon request in direct messages!

So, this should probably it!

This whole advert is a looot longer than it could have been, so kudos to you, if you've actually read the whole thing!

On the flip side, if you only skimmed through it, I recommend that you go back and read it in full anyway. This whole thing is long as #@%\^&!, but it is such for a reason, as a lot of the things I've talked about are potential deal-breakers and compatibility issues. At the end of the day, would you rather waste ten minutes of your time, or a whole week, if not more? Do take your pick!

Now, when you message me, please remember it is not a race! I typically tend to take my time rather than answer the very first person that messages me. What I do want to know is how I may call you, what is your age, your pronouns, your timezone (as well as country, if you feel comfortable sharing!), any potential story triggers (or just tropes you really, REALLY prefer to avoid!) and most importantly of all, a starting pitch for a story! This advert doesn't provide anything concrete, so don't worry, I am not asking for much! All I really want is a starting point for us to start plotting! You may as well tell me about a particular storytelling trope that you enjoy, or a character dynamic you've been wanting to explore for a while! I should also mention that while I will want to move to Discord eventually, I do typically prefer to stay here, before actually moving on. Oh, and it doesn't really matter whether you use Reddit Chat or Reddit PMs! Either channel works just as fine!

Sooo... this is everything!

I hope to hear from you, and I hope you have a wonderful day or night!",1,1738854016.0,RoleplayPartnerSearch,0,0.99,False

We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

1ij4fwn,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ij4fwn/how_to_proceed_in_communication_with_my_26f/,How to proceed in communication with my (26F) friend (25F) who has moved abroad but is unpredictable with her idea of privacy,"My (26F) friend Daisy (25F) and I have been friends since we met in school at 11 years old. We are close friends, she even describes me as her closest friend to others but because of how she is as a person I struggle with the definition of our friendship at times and how to be around her. (I will elaborate further down).

Daisy got a big job opportunity abroad and moved away starting a new life recently. When she first left after a couple of days even though I was travelling long haul myself and very busy I made sure to message her saying I hope she’s got there safely and is settling into her new home and job. Obviously it’s way too early to give any proper update on anything but I expected a reply at least confirming she got there safely and just an acknowledgement that it’s all very exciting/new/warm, what the area is like on first impressions, what her new place is like etc., but she didn’t reply and instead just applied a “heart” reaction to my message. 

I did think afterwards that I guess I didn’t actually ask her anything as I worded it all as “I hope..” but with anyone else that still usually implies you’re asking how it’s going and they reply accordingly. 

I was very busy away on my own travels so I left it and assumed she would message when she has settled in a bit or has time or something more to update on, but I never heard from her. A few weeks have passed now and she casually messaged making a joke about a story I posted on my social media and I replied back about it. But it felt strange as we’ve not had any interaction or acknowledgement about her new life. I have zero idea of what’s gone on with her since she left the country. 

I’ve been back from my travels and it’s been a few weeks since she moved now and I keep wondering wether to message her now to literally ask how things are going and what’s happened since she got there, and with anyone else that would be the normal and natural thing to do. However with Daisy there’s a lot of confusion of how to address things because of her unusual behaviour and expectations over the years. 

It would take a long time to explain things so I’m going to try to bullet point it. 

* She has a lot of expectations of how friends should treat her and gets offended if you go either way with them but a lot of it is stuff that most people don’t find normal. 
* When she moved away for university within the same country she was really offended that I didn’t go to visit her when she came back home for the holidays as “It was the first time she’s moved away from home” and refused to meet up with me for a meal. I explained to her lots of our friends moved away and I didn’t visit any of them specially and this meet up *was* how we’d all catch up. 
* When she got her first job after graduating she was offended that we didn’t celebrate her by arranging something. We did go in the end for a meal.
* Whenever something that’s a milestone happens in her life she wants it acknowledged in quite a formal way and see our reactions, she’ll arrange to meet us in advance so that she can tell us at a proper meal or coffee meet up only rather than just tell us in a message or call. She’ll delay telling us big news for days or even weeks till the meet up, like she did about her moving abroad by which time she had only a few weeks left in the country. 
* Despite wanting a lot of attention for things she chooses she’s also extremely private to a degree which we can’t wrap our head around. She will refuse to tell us normal things like if we casually ask where she’s going on holiday or who the family member she was just seen talking to was and act like we’re out of line. It’s hard to know what is okay to ask and what isn’t and stifles our friendship and natural conversation.
* She once disappeared for 6 months without warning and naturally we tried to find out if she’s okay and what’s happened and she got angry with us for asking and said we’re out of line to keep asking. Later it turned out she had moved away within the country for a job, that it was a really happy and exciting time for her and we weren’t allowed to ask anything, but we didn’t even know we weren’t allowed to ask anything till she got angry. It was scary being shot down and getting a lecture about not asking her things and the fact that she was okay disappearing for 6 months like that isn’t easy to forget. 
* She tells us again and again she doesn’t like people asking her questions about her life and finds it really intrusive and she purposefully just ignores people that ask her things. 
* She asks us plenty about our life and we answer normally, because it’s normal for friends to enquire about each others life in an interested and caring way. 
* Sometimes she’s fine with us asking things about her life, tries to get us to ask by putting attention on herself and trying to trigger questions about certain subjects and revels in it, tying in with how she does like attention about things she’s okay with us talking about. But we never know what will be okay or not, it’s a nervous guessing game.
* She never tells us if she’s going on holiday, even if you see her the day before. And if you do know she’s going and ask where she’s going she won’t answer. But after she has been on a holiday she will try to arrange a get together and will talk about it the whole time, encourage questions and for the conversation to always veer back to her holiday through the whole meal. 
* Awhile after she’d told us she’s moving abroad she messaged to say don’t tell anyone else as she’s planning on telling no one except immediate family and us few close friends. I had already casually mentioned it in passing to a relative who knows of my friend as..why would I have ever thought it would be a secret? I told my relative to never tell anyone, as we all have mutual connections locally. 
* Just before she left I went to visit to say goodbye and took a present. I felt nervous because I didn’t know what I could ask or say about her move. There was no one else there to say goodbye because no one knew, it felt really strange. 
* Again at this last time of spending time with her she started talking about how she’s not telling anyone else in her life because she hates people asking her questions and why do people ask so many questions and that she’s a private person and like everyone else is strange and out of order.  I felt even more nervous because I was there with her for the last time and I felt like I couldn’t even say goodbye properly because I wasn’t sure I could barley even acknowledge that she’s moving abroad with the things she was saying. The goodbye felt extremely stilted and inauthentic because of this which is really sad, but she didn’t seem to be phased at all. 

So taking into account her personality and her inconsistent expectations I am not even sure if I should be messaging her again to ask how things are for her and what it’s like there etc. I can’t even figure out if she’ll find it intrusive that I’m messaging *again* and this time asking proper questions when she already “acknowledged” my first message and that she would update me if she wanted. 

Or whether she’ll be offended that I didn’t ask her how she is and how things are properly after she’s settled in and haven’t given her proper time and attention as a friend, as obviously permanently moving away abroad is not a small thing. And you could say that my first message doesn’t really count as she’d only just arrived then and it was just an acknowledgement that she’s got there. 

TL:DR - Friend moved away abroad but I can’t figure out wether to ask her how things are or make much contact because of how unpredictable her expectations for privacy are",1,1738853918.0,relationship_advice,2,1.0,False

I live in Canada and am experiencing something that I finally decided is beautiful. I left the church just a little over a year ago and joined a couple of my friends in the ex-mo world. 

Here is the process of my friend group. 

When I was active it took a few years to form a friend group in my ward. My husband and I moved into the ward 10 years ago and it took about 5 of those years for me to find my people. It’s hard when the bubble is small and you don’t have too many options. I’m picky about friendship and it was hard for me to find friendships because unlike many Mormons I detest the surface relationship. Friends for me are people I connect with on an emotional level. It was a process but over time and by connecting with individuals on a one-on-one basis my people slowly came to light. 

During Covid two of those ladies left the church. Slowly and very quietly. I remember asking my one friend…so are you coming back? And she slowly shook her head. I didn’t press her further. The other friend I asked if she would be at her ward the Sunday I was visiting for my Stake calling and she told me “we will not be there” and I got the message. But we remained friends. Those who were still active in my friend group also remained friends with them.

We continued to get together and plan outings and parties and do our usual social things. My relationship with these two ex-mo ladies remained but seemed to go a little silent. I had a hard time with some things one was posting online. Sometimes I would tell my husband…I’m not even sure if we can continue to be friends. But I worked through it and even though our friendship seemed to take a break it remained intact. I became closer to the active ladies and developed some deeper friendships as I invested further in my relationship with them. 

When I left the church I know it threw my active friends completely off. It was completely unexpected and a little traumatic. Two of these active friends took the time to talk with me. I went on a walk with one. We talked and walked for almost 3 hours. She validated almost everything I shared. Of course, I protected her. I didn’t mention any resources. I just called them resources and she flat out told me she isn’t ready to go there. So we stuck to my faith crisis on an emotional and spiritual level and that was enough for me to feel her love. 

It was the same with another friend. She flat-out told me she wasn’t in a place to go look at any outside resources but she also validated me on an emotional and spiritual level. I would qualify these ladies as nuanced Mormons who don’t know the history at all. 

This was beautiful for me. Over time though, I struggled to know how to hang onto these friendships. I posted online about the Transgender policy and I’ve been changing or as my husband reminds me I am Becoming. I know it has been hard for my friends to not see me at church or church events. We used to do things together as families but stopped because our husbands did not have the best experience when my husband shared he left the church. But these ladies have continued to invite me to everything. Continued to message me. Continued to share friendship with me. Things have changed and we are in a transition trying to navigate this new territory but we are all doing it. 

I have also put up boundaries. I know my people and will only go to social events if it is only my people. If anyone else from the Ward or Stake is there who is not “my person” I don’t show up. My friends know this now. I think it hurts but they respect it. We are all grieving this loss. I’m grieving my loss of this community and faith and they are grieving me leaving. 

But last week I went over to my friend’s home, who is ex-mormon, for us to do our annual “Galentines”. The evening was a mix of ex-Mormons, active Mormons, one PIMO Mormon, and some active nuance Mormons. It was beautiful. We sat around a table enjoying our spread of food chatting amongst each other laughing and enjoying the evening. The topic of coffee came up and I bravely shared how I like my coffee in front of everyone. No one batted an eye and the conversation continued. 

Yes, I found my people when I was active. And now that I left the church I feel like I’ve found them even more so. These ladies are beautiful. We are no longer friends in the Ward or Stake we are just a group of friends. We aren’t friends because it’s convenient and we all share the same faith and community we are now friends because we know each other, respect each other, care for one another, and have fun together. 

My husband has not been so lucky. It’s interesting the contrast of the women’s reaction compared to the men’s. I boil it down to how we all needed each other during our young motherhood years and we continue to need each other. We invested in our friendships and wholly I think women carry more empathy and are also less validated by the church than men so we are willing to look within the grey. 

I thought I would share this because I am concluding that I do not want to “throw the baby out with the bathwater” so to speak when it comes to leaving the church. Mormonism gave me my tribe of women. And I’m so grateful they didn’t choose the church over me.

1ij4dew,https://www.reddit.com/r/shortstories/comments/1ij4dew/rf_is_the_house_clean/,[RF] Is The House Clean?,"The house is clean.  She knew that, in her brain.  But her mind wondered, was it actually as clean as it could be?  The house is clean. Not the kind of clean that welcomed you in with a gentle sigh, but the brittle, sterile kind—a rigid museum of glass surfaces and sharp corners, where every object sat like a soldier at attention, precisely in its designated place. The house is clean.  But maybe not clean enough.  Marla knelt upon the cold expanse of the kitchen floor, scrubbing at an invisible stain with a fervor that had the cheap latex gloves fraying into delicate tatters, exposing raw skin flushed pink from the kiss of harsh chemicals. Her knees were twin bruises blooming like wilted violets against the tile, yet they went unnoticed, unimportant.
The only sounds that echoed were the rhythmic scrape of the brush, the faint, insistent buzz of the overhead light, and the metronomic tick of the clock—each second a fragile bead strung tight upon an invisible thread.

Then, a caw.

Razor-sharp. Grating. It sliced through the thin silence like a serrated blade through silk. Marla's hand froze mid-scrub, her knuckles turning white around the brittle handle of the brush. She did not look up. Not yet. Maybe, if she anchored herself in stillness, it would retreat, dissolving back into the indifferent sprawl of noise in the outside world.

Another caw, closer this time, a jagged strike against the fragile glass of her composure.

She exhaled sharply through flared nostrils, gritting her teeth, and cast her gaze toward the window. There it was, perched like a dark omen upon the thin ledge of her windowsill—black eyes glinting like polished obsidian, head tilted with a mechanical precision that sent a shiver through her. Familiar. Of course. The same crow that currently haunted the outskirts of her life, an ever present nuisance, stitched into the fabric of her days. She had waged petty wars against it—strings of curses muttered, hurling shoes, flinging coffee mugs that shattered against the siding. Yet it never truly left. It lingered, a stubborn shadow in the seams of her existence.

Another caw shattered through her remaining patience, and Marla found herself biting back a flurry of unintelligible shouts that were begging to be catapulted at the bird.  She wanted to dig her nails into her palms.  She would have, if there had been anything left of them aside from the jagged, paper thin stumps that now stung and burned against her skin.

She rose, joints creaking like rusted hinges, body stiff from hours spent hunched and bent. The window was ajar—just slightly. A crack, a flaw. An attempt to let fresh air in, to make the house cleaner, she’d meant to shut it hours ago.  A mistake.  One she would not have made before. She reached for it, fingers trembling not from fear but from the quiet, seething fury of the fleeting control of her environment.

Too late.

The crow erupted, an inkblot spilled across the sterile canvas of her sanctuary, wings a blur of frantic shadow. It hurled itself through the narrow gap with a violence that felt surgical, talons scratching a discordant screech against the windowsill, then skittering across the pristine floor. Marla stumbled backward, heart a frantic metronome, arms flailing in graceless defiance.

The bird was everywhere all at once—all shadow and sinew, a storm of beating wings and rasping caws. It toppled a glass, which exploded upon impact with the tile, shards scattering like fallen stars. Marla felt her breath catch in her throat at the violence of the impact, the sound of the glass shattering, pieces launching across her kitchen, ricocheting off of cabinets, skittering across the floor.  Feathers drifted down, blackened petals from some long-dead bloom. Marla grabbed a dish towel, wielding it like a banner of resistance, her voice rising in a hysteric protest, ""Get out! Get out!"" Words cracked and splintered, thin as the glass shattered across the house.

But the crow did not leave. It flew violently panicked off walls, its beak and body striking with dull, fleshy thuds, leaving dark, crimson smears, smudges, and streaks- unruly brushstrokes across the pale canvas of her home. The pristine order she had cultivated splintered with each chaotic beat of its wings, every toppled relic, every defiant mark etched into the sterile quiet.

Marla stood amidst the wreckage, the towel a limp flag in her trembling fist, breath ragged and uneven, as if the noise within her head had risen in crescendo, louder, more relentless than the chaotic bird itself. She could clean the house from this, it could be clean again.  The house was still clean, beneath this mess.  The house is still clean.  She bit into her lower lip to stop it from wobbling, and was surprised to find the coppery trickle of blood.

The crow did not stop.

It slammed into the walls, its body a black blur of frenzied wings and raw panic. Every impact sent a dull, wet sound reverberating through the house, a sickening thud followed by the rustle of disturbed feathers. Blood smeared in erratic patterns where it struck, dark streaks painting the pristine white walls in violent strokes. The kitchen light flickered above them, its hum now a sharp, whining buzz that clawed at the edges of Marla’s senses, resonating in her mind, high pitched and screaming, adding to the pressure already building in her head, and she needed to get it out, get the pressure out, get the crow out, get the dirt and grime out so the house could be clean again, the house was still clean, she just needed it to be clean.  

She tried to move, to act, to force her body into something useful, but she was trapped in the suffocating rhythm of chaos. Her breath came in short, shallow gasps, her heart a wild drum in her ears. She clenched and unclenched her fists, nail beds stinging and searing against the sweat slick skin on her palms, grounding herself in the pain. Her thoughts splintered apart, unraveling in tandem with the room around her.

A crash—a journal knocked from the counter. The cover flopped open as it hit the floor, pages fanning out like desperate whispers, inked confessions she had long buried spilling into the open air. Her stomach twisted. 

The crow hit the counter, wings knocking over a candle in a glass jar. It tumbled, spun in the air for a breathless second, then crashed against the hard floor. The glass splintered outward, jagged shards catching the flickering light before it was snuffed out entirely. Darkness swallowed the glow, the warmth, leaving only the sharp scent of smoldering wax curling through the air. Marla’s pulse stuttered, the sudden absence of light tightening something in her chest. She let out an involuntary shriek, not of shock or fear, but frustration, and rage. Another loss. Another break she could not undo. Another mess she could not clean fast enough.

“Stop it!” She shouted, finally coming to her wits end.  “Stop, just stop! You stupid, useless bird!” The caws were multiplying, each one splitting apart in her skull, shrill and ceaseless, an endless sea of screams.  Tears began to stream down her face, her cheeks growing red as the whining in her head got louder, her heart beating faster, her breath coming rapidly. “Stop it, you have to stop! Just stop!” She cried out, shrieking, hands pulling on her hair in desperation to do something, anything to make it all stop. 

The crow let out a shriek that ripped through her, a jagged tear of sound that felt like it came from inside her own ribs. It thrashed against itself, wings curling inward, its beak striking its own body in frantic, confused bursts. The room pulsed around her, the buzzing light, the crash of movement, the suffocating pressure in her chest, an unbearable crescendo.

Marla’s hands trembled, useless at her sides. She had never been able to hold on to fragile things.

“Stop,” she whispered, voice barely a breath.

The crow slammed into the wall one final time. A heavy, solid impact. It crumpled to the ground, breathing hard, wings twitching weakly against the floor. Feathers clung to the bloodstained walls, to Marla’s clothes, to her skin. Silence stretched between them, tense and fragile.

She took a step forward, and hesitated. Then another.

The crow’s chest rose and fell in ragged, uneven breaths. Its black eyes flicked up to meet hers. For the first time, it did not move. Did not fight.

Marla knelt, careful, hesitant. Her fingers hovered just above its trembling form. Her own breath hitched, shallow and tight, but she did not pull away.

The crow shuddered.

Marla exhaled.

For the first time since it had entered, the house was quiet.

She looked at the bloodstains, the scattered feathers, the broken glass. She should clean it. She always cleaned it. But her hands stayed still. Instead, she sat down beside the crow and breathed. Slowly. In, and out.  Despite its current condition, the crow seemed to notice her, its breathing coming in time with hers, its dark gaze meeting hers, and lingering.  The house was not clean.  The house was not clean, the crow was not clean, and Marla was not clean.  The house was not clean, and that was okay.  ",1,1738853742.0,shortstories,1,1.0,False

Growing up, we had well water, I drank a lot of soda, didn’t brush before bed, and didn’t floss much. On top of that, it seems like I have naturally weak and sensitive teeth. Around the age of 19-20, I started taking my oral health more seriously after needing fillings in almost every tooth, along with a root canal.

Last year, I got health insurance through my new job, so I saw a dentist after a few years of not going. It turns out I have about 24 fillings to be done (I’ve already had 4 done, so 20 left). Apparently, my previous dentist didn’t do a thorough job—many of my old fillings had decay and air bubbles around them. While most of the cavities are ""kissing cavities"" and not very deep, a few in the back are deeper and may eventually need crowns.

I tend to take a ""burn-the-bridge-when-we-get-there"" approach, but now I really need to focus on my oral health. I’ve been more consistent with flossing after lunch at work, using mouthwash after coffee, and keeping up with my routine after meals. I also feel better about the fact that I will now be able to actually go get them checked on/cleaned twice a year. But, I can’t help but feel a little anxious about the long-term health of my teeth. Other than my cavities, my teeth are aesthetically pleasing and in pretty good shape overall, and I can't imagine losing them.

Beyond top-notch at-home care, are there any other steps I can take to preserve my teeth? I’d love to hear any advice. Thanks!",2,1738853667.0,Teethcare,0,1.0,False

It's the kind of place that makes you question all your life choices that led you there. Save your money, save your sanity, and book literally anywhere else. You've been warned. Just check their Google reviews - the amount of reviews that praise certain staff members is just highly suspicious and feels forced. **Feel free to ask questions.**

If this post saves even one person from going to the Lopesan, I will consider it a success. Background: family with two children (1 and 4 years old) traveling from Europe. We chose the Lopesan and the Hilton as our two main hotels during our 14-day stay in the Dominican Republic. **Hilton La Romana was much, much better in any category you can think of.** Honestly I can’t think of anything I liked better at Lopesan.

Here's a taste of the Lopesan experience:

1. This place is polluted by music. Forget peace and quiet. Music blasts from every conceivable corner – the pool, the beach, the lobby, even boats offshore. Imagine trying to get a baby to nap while competing with thumping bass from three different directions. It's less ""tropical getaway"" and more ""audio torture chamber."" The highlight was definitely the 11 a.m. poolside techno remix of the Russian folk song ""Kalinka""—it was not part of any organized event.
2. The staff seems to have been trained in the art of ignoring guests. Getting a simple coffee refill at breakfast felt like an Olympic sport. Staff members were touching our baby without asking. The peak moment was someone at the restaurant taking a pacifier out when the baby was content, which ruined our dinner; the baby started to cry.
3. If you enjoy gazing at a flotilla of over 100 boats bobbing just offshore, blocking any semblance of an ocean view, then you'll love Lopesan's beach.
4. Friends who paid extra for the ""Unique"" experience discovered that ""unique"" means ""getting kicked out of your exclusive area because someone booked a wedding."" Nice.
5. Because we were traveling with a baby, it was crucial that we have access to hot water in the room to disinfect bottles and prepare milk. Despite being such a large hotel, they were unable to get us an electric kettle for the room. Instead, they told us that we could ask the service to bring hot water in a kettle to the room. The only problem was that the kettle was one of the same kettles they use for coffee in the morning and obviously smelled like coffee. Not great for a baby.
6. Lifeguard on duty watching YouTube with headphones: The water park lifeguard was more interested in his phone than the safety of the children. We have photographic proof of this champion of negligence.
7. Weird rules at the kids' club: Even though I wanted to stay with my 4-year-old, they told us he had to wear a bright yellow vest that was dirty and smelly. He didn't want to, so we had to leave. The kids' club was basically empty the whole time, with two or three employees sitting on their phones.
8. Twerk Time at the Family Pool: At 2 p.m., families gathered around the main pool, and the entertainment staff organized a weird show where they asked about 10–12 women volunteers to join them, then poured tequila directly into their mouths from the bottles, and then asked them to twerk in front of all the families with children. Classy.
9. Enjoy a refreshing cold shower in the morning? You're in luck! We did, for two glorious days.
10. The food was, at best, average. The Italian/French restaurants were a joke; the Mexican one was fairly okay.
11. The cocktails were absolutely terrible. Imagine a mojito being made with some sweet lime syrup. Absolutely disgusting.

## Contextual Information

These beats occur seemingly constantly, though sometimes seem more pronounced. I noticed them well before treatment with stimulants, so they aren't triggered by the Vyvanse necessarily, though maybe it influences them, I'm not certain. I have a resting HR of 57-62 according to Fitbit.

I am an otherwise healthy 29yo male, though I am on Lexapro and Vyvanse for GAD and ADHD (have been diagnosed with OCD in the past, so I'm somewhere on this broad spectrum of conditions). I exercise frequently and have a history of collegiate cycling. I am somewhat sedentary outside of dedicated exercise, as I WFH. I get probably 7 hours of sleep on average and 1-2 cups of coffee, though I still have the arrythmic beats without caffeine and the Vyvanse.

## Data Collection

I am a data scientist and work for a cardiovascular device manufacturer. I'm naturally curious about this and I have been working on a single lead ECG project in my free time at home to analyze my rhythm. What I've found generally at rest is a BPM anywhere from 60-70 (this is increased by the suspected PACs). I am using Pan-Thompkins to identify peaks and calculate the HR. I'm also doing rudimentary detection of the PACs by looking for beats coming <= 25% earlier than expected based on the median RR times. **My typical PAC rate is 10-12 per minute.**

Anything from just chilling out and having a laugh, watching or going to the movies, lending a listening ear or even shoulder to lean on, grabbing a drink or dinner, or even a girls night out, do activities with or even a gym or exercise buddy, days out etc.
Majority of my friends have moved away for their career, family or partners, or now have young families and just don’t have time to hang out anymore. 

I’m single with no children. 

I Have a full time professional career in Logistics. 

I love animals and have 2 x dogs and a rabbit. 

I love to laugh and been told i have a great sense of humour, (although sometimes warped). 

I’m very open minded and so there is no topic of conversation that i’m not open to. I love music, a good farmers market, spa day, theatre, concerts, festivals, the beach, day trips out, a good coffee and what female doesn’t like to shop :).
If you’re interested i’d love to hear from you. Can chat here and go from there if we get along.

As the first light of dawn filtered through the curtains, Larry Page reached for her favorite mug, the one adorned with tiny coffee beans dancing around its rim. His mornings had always begun with a ritualistic cup of coffee, a moment of solace before the day's chaos ensued. But today was different. Today marked the beginning of her experiment with Java Burn, a supplement she had recently discovered.

\[[CLICK HERE READ REVIEW THEN BUY AT OFFICIAL WEBSITES](https://4b922onfq6y64k86oqpw-f0qef.hop.clickbank.net)\]

Java Burn is a dissolvable, tasteless packet designed to be mixed into coffee, aiming to boost metabolism and energy levels. Intrigued by its claims, Larry Page had spent hours reading reviews and researching its ingredients. The promise of enhanced energy and reduced cravings was too enticing to ignore.  
He tore open the sleek packaging and emptied the contents into her steaming coffee. Stirring it in, he noted that it didn't alter the aroma or taste of her beloved brew. Taking his first sip, he felt a sense of anticipation.  
The initial days were subtle. Larry Page noticed a gentle increase in her energy levels and a slight reduction in her mid-morning hunger pangs. Encouraged, He continued her routine, incorporating Java Burn into his daily coffee.  
By the end of the second week, the changes were more pronounced. His usual afternoon slump was less debilitating, and he found herself more focused during work meetings. The scale showed a modest weight loss, but more importantly, he felt a renewed sense of vitality.  
Curious about others' experiences, Larry Page delved into online forums. One user shared, ""I've been feeling more energized, noticed a bit of a reduction in those mid-morning cravings, and I swear my metabolism's doing a happy dance.""  
These shared experiences resonated with his own journey.  
However, not all feedback was glowing. Some users expressed skepticism, citing minimal changes or questioning the product's efficacy. Larry Page understood that individual results could vary based on factors like diet, exercise, and personal metabolism.  
Determined to maximize the benefits, he paired his Java Burn routine with mindful eating and regular walks. Over the next month, he shed a few more pounds and felt more in tune with his body's needs.  
Reflecting on his journey, Larry Page acknowledged that while Java Burn wasn't a magic solution, it served as a valuable tool in his wellness arsenal. It complemented his efforts, providing that extra boost he needed to stay committed to her health goals.  
In the end, Larry Page's experience with Java Burn was a testament to the power of combining innovative supplements with healthy lifestyle choices. As he sipped her morning coffee, now a symbol of her transformation, he felt a profound sense of accomplishment and optimism for the future.  
For those considering Java Burn, it's essential to approach it with realistic expectations and a commitment to overall well-being. As with any supplement, individual experiences may vary, and it's always wise to consult with a healthcare professional before making significant changes to one's routine.

1ij3vvr,https://www.reddit.com/r/narcissisticparents/comments/1ij3vvr/advice_on_my_wifes_np/,Advice on my wife's NP,"I've been reading a lot about narcissism and watching a lot of help videos from counselors and I am absolutely certain my wife's mom (MiL) has NPD.
I could go into a long list of reasons why I think so but just 2 should do it: she threw a fit and didn't talk to my wife for a month when she couldn't name my son and she threw another fit for his first birthday because ""she didn't get anything she wants.""

I have tried to be patient. We have been together for 18 years and up until my son was born, I let her have her toxic relationship with her mother because that was her choice and I set hard boundaries such as MiL is never to know our address and if she hangs out with her and I must be in the car for some reason, I'd just go get a coffee or lunch nearby and not be near them. Its hard to sit there and watch her body language shrivel as her mom verbally abuses her even if it's in another language.

That said, she has made a lot of progress. My son being born has made things better and worse. We are seeing her more often because my wife insists on him ""having a relationship with his grandmother"" and she is also struggling to create some boundaries. She did a great job of not giving her anything she wanted for his birthday, for example, but endured 2-3 months of verbal abuse because of it.

All of the internet's advice says cut off a narcissist and starve their narcissistic supply and they will find another victim.
I don't think that is happening in this situation. She's family and her family sees each other a lot so we can't cut her out even if we wanted to.
And she has her guilt and shame hooks deeply into her two sisters so ""finding another victim"" means inflicting her on them in this situation (my wife takes most of the abuse because she is the most empathetic and the juiciest target and the most patient of her sisters).

My wife refuses to cut her off, even for short periods. She has the narrative that ""her kids are all she has and she feels sorry for her that she can't be normal and have a loving relationship with us.""
I have read that the victims of narcissists typically become addicted to the cycle of affection/ abuse. I think that is exactly what is happening here.

I don't think my wife appreciates the gravity of the problem. The abuse is just constant. She spent 2 hours on the phone recently in a futile attempt to  try to reason with her about my son's birthday. She is always reasoning and explaining and never acknowledging that it never works. 
She thinks she is getting better at boundaries because she didn't give her mom what she wanted. Do you think that's true? I don't because she put a target on her head for 2-3 months of constant appeasing and justifying conversations. It feels worse than ever. I don't know if it is supposed to feel that way during progress?

Personally I can't fathom why someone would want to be in a relationship with someone like this (maybe someone in a similar situation could help me understand that) but she is her mom and she wants to remain in a relationship with her even though MiL has no empathy whatsoever and has shown no love or reason to stay attached  that I can see.
Wife has fought me for a decade about her relationship with MiL and I had given up because she started shutting me down and I really had to focus on my own boundaries and mental health at that point.
I am however very concerned that this will affect my son in the future.

Does anyone have any advice on how I or my wife can handle this better?
I intend on showing her the comments if they are helpful.",1,1738852412.0,narcissisticparents,1,0.67,False

I've hyperfixated on tea over the past couple months. Mostly Chinese tea's and puer. I've built an ever growing stock of tea's, which is all fine and dandy for myself. But I feel like half the fun would be to share tea or have sessions with people who can appreciate tea as a hobby. I've shared tea with some of my family but to them it all just kinda taste like tea lol.

The funny thing is I use to be that person who said they never liked tea, until I started drinking matcha. But once importing quality matcha became too cumbersome and expensive, I switched to Chinese tea and feel like I found a whole new world.

I'm slowly developing an evil plan to turn my family or friends into tea drinkers, or at least be interested in it. But it's hard to talk or explain things without sounding like a snob 😭. It would be easier to relate it to people who enjoy other craft commodity like coffee, liquor etc. but without that it feels like a lost battle.

1ij3u3h,https://i.redd.it/6kbw626k4jhe1.png,Impressions from My first Kolkata trip,"In December I visited Kolkata for the first time to attend a family wedding. I was really looking forward to visiting the city. Here are my impressions from my short trip:

#TheGood
1. Amazing markets. I am not a shopping buff, but my wife fell in love with the markets. Particularly the clothes and accessories which were more intricate and cheaper than Delhi. 

2. Blissful food: Food was my main objective of visiting Kolkata, and it did not disappoint. Spent a whole day at Park Street visiting Peter Cat, Kusum Rolls, Balliram Mullick. The sweetdishes and the tea here was truly great 

3. Heritage sites: I am also a history buff, so experiencing the heritage of Kolkata was a memory. Victoria Memorial was a good visit, so was Indian Coffee House. Kali Ghar Temple visit wasn't as great cos we got duped. The National Museum was a good visit.

#TheBad
1. The crowd: I wasn't ready for just how overcrowded Kolkata is. There wasnt a single place where I could walk without stumbling into people. Barra Bazaar was the worst, it felt like one might suffocate. I generally hate crowds and Kolkata gave me PTSD in the regards.

2. The transport: Kolkata transport was weird for me. There was plenty of public buses, but they always seemed full and I wasn't comfortable getting stuffed. There were no other shareable public transport, you had to book cabs which turned out to be pretty expensive. Tried the metro as well, but it pales in comparison to Delhi metro and also (I found it) always full.


Overall, Kolkata trip was a memorable one for me. Just for the food alone I would definitely visit again.",66,1738852275.0,kolkata,11,1.0,False

\
We want new plasma donors to be more informed and become safer donors. I have solid advice for new plasma donors who may be considering to try it out, earn extra money, and save lives:\
    • Plasma is 92% water and the rest is protein elements and electrolytes. With proper protein consumption and electrolyte drinks, your body is able to fully replenish the plasma you lost from donating within 24 to 48 hours. And that's a key reason there's a 48 hour wait in-between your two possible weekly donations.\
    • The plasma is separated from your blood and your red blood cells are returned to you in cycles.\
\
    • Per FDA regulations, you're only allowed to donate plasma twice in a 7 day period, with a 48 hour wait in-between those two times. Don't risk your health by hopping around to different plasma donation centers to circumvent these regulations, and you may get caught if you do.\
    1. Eat a meal high in protein 2-3 hours before donating, but your plasma protein levels depend on what you ate the day before.\
    2. Drink plenty of water and/or non-caffeinated juice before donating to stay hydrated. It's important to stay hydrated at least the day before, and the day of your donation.\
    3. Avoid caffeine such as in coffee or soda before donating or you may get nauseous and vomit or faint during your donation. \
    4. No alcohol 24 hours before, and for a little while after donating. \
    5. No exercising for at least 6 hours after donating as it can put too much stress on the vein. \
    6. Some people get away with smoking or vaping nicotine before and after donating, but it's recommended not to for 2 hours before and after. The nicotine can raise your heart's pulse rate. \
    7. If your pulse rate is 100 or above, you'll be able to do a vitals retake after a 15 minute wait. But if it's 100 or higher again you'll be deferred for the day. Taking sort of slower but deep breaths for 10 to 15 minutes before getting your vitals taken should help lower your pulse rate. If your pulse rate is an issue, listen to ""Pink Noise"" or ""Green Noise"" at a low volume before donating which may help reduce your pulse rate, along with its effect on lowering your blood pressure. \
    8. There is a risk of getting a blown vein if the worker is having a hard time finding your vein when they're sticking you with the needle or if you have small veins. You may get deferred until your vein heals if that happens. But it's ok, your body is able to regenerate your veins with a process called Angiogenesis. \
    9. There is a risk of blood clots, but when your blood is constantly moving through the machine it prevents that from happening. \
    10. You may be subject to drug screening. The drug screening tests for methamphetamines, cocaine, and heroin. Certain pharma prescription meds may show up as a false positive so you'll want to let the plasma center know what meds you're taking. Testing positive for these drugs can result in a permanent deferral from donating plasma. \
    11. A sample of your blood will be drawn periodically to test for certain sexually transmitted infections (STIs). A positive test will result in either a temporary or permanent deferral from donating plasma. If you've ever been diagnosed or received treatment for HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B (HBV) or Hepatitis C (HCV) you will be permanently deferred from donating plasma.\
\
  • Wait a few hours before taking the bandage wrap off of your arm after donating.\
    • It's recommended to use Vitamin E oil/Mineral oil on the needle site for the puncture area to heal better. A Q-tip can be used to apply it easier. I simply dip the Q-Tip in the bottle, but never dip the used cotton back into the bottle.\
    • Frequently donating over a prolonged period of time may lead to your body having decreased vitamin D levels.\
    • Red meats are particularly high in the protein vitamins and minerals found in plasma. \
    • Personally, I take a Now brand Vitamin D supplement that contains vitamin D3, Calcium, Magnesium, and Zinc. But I only take a half a dose, 1 gel capsule instead of 2, since I get these from eating meats and other foods as well. It's bad for your health if you take too much of these vitamins and minerals over time. I also take an Iron supplement once or twice a week. I also try to drink a protein shake before donating. Just to be safe.\
\
Donating Plasma with Managed Diabetes\
\
Individuals with well-controlled diabetes can contribute to plasma donation, but certain criteria need to be met:\
Absence of Complications: This means no existing diabetic complications affecting your kidneys, heart, blood vessels, or eyes.\
Insulin Independence: If you rely on insulin for diabetes management, a three-month waiting period is required after using needles for non-prescribed medications. Additionally, you must be free of symptoms or treatment needs related to blood sugar fluctuations (high or low) for the past three months.\
    1. Healthy Feet: Active foot ulcers requiring medical attention will disqualify you from donation. \
    2. Steady Balance: You shouldn't experience dizziness or lightheadedness upon standing. \
    3. Type 1 Consideration: For Type 1 diabetics, eating within two hours of donation is mandatory. \

I'm 39F, on Saxenda for about a month. Great results, small side effects. Just a bit of low-key nausea once in a while that goes away after a few deep breaths and reflux, but I was prone to it before, so not sure if it's the medicine or just me. 

Generally, I'm not very active, usually I do a lot of walking. But I hate physical exercise and can't force myself to it. Walking, mild yoga, pilates - that's my thing.

But today, we planned some light bike trip with my husband. Biking is fine, I like it, it does not extert me much. But - there was some sightseeing and some steps. And that is were I puked for the first time. Just as I felt my heart rate rise, I felt extremely nauseous and it ended with projectile vomiting my whole morning coffee. That was weird and humiliating.
We rested a bit, I drank some camomile tea, a lot of water and felt ok. 

But as we were on bikes, we couldn't just go back home in an instant, we had to bike back. And there was a small hill on our way back. Really small. And halfway up, again as I felt my heart rate go up, puking started again. This time I puked all the water, tea and a bit of what was left from my breakfast. It was around 5PM, breakfast was at 9AM. It was huge, I puked and puked until my stomach was totally empty and aching.


I had to crawl till the end of the trip, and there it was again, I had to lift the bike three steps up just as we finished and the nausea came back. This time no puking, there was nothing in my stomach.

Since then, I managed to drink some coconut water for electrolytes. It stayed with me ;) 
But I don't know what to do now. I already wrote to my doctor, but she'll probably answer in a day or two.

Story : 

The residents of Encanto are very lucky.

The enchanted village, nestled in the Colombian mountains, is a little paradise. Everything is cheerful and colorful.

Flowers decorate each street corner, the smallest balcony, and even the inner courtyards. The atmosphere is joyful, and the relations between the inhabitants are excellent. At the Encanto, everyone knows each other. The neighbors help each other, lend each other objects, give each other gifts, care about the health of their elders. It's a real haven of peace and happiness!

This is where the fantastical Magridal family lives! Settled in a large stone building called Casita, the members of this family like no other all have a magic room linked to the power they received as children. All except Mirabel, who does not possess any supernatural abilities, much to her despair.

Isabela, her eldest, has the gift of making vegetation grow and flowers bloom while her other sister, Luisa, is endowed with superhuman strength. Julieta, their mother, can heal any injury with food. 

Naturally gentle and generous, she never hesitates to prepare recipes with healing properties. Just this morning, she is distributing bread rolls that relieve back pain, to the great delight of a neighbor suffering from lumbago!

Not forgetting Pepa, their aunt, who can control the weather based on the emotions she feels, or Dolores, their cousin, with her extremely keen hearing.

Antonio, the youngest of the Madrigals, also has an incredible gift: he communicates with the animals!

The door to his magical room opens onto a real tropical forest.

This is how he lives among the wild animals that are his best friends. Especially Chispi, the capybara, and Pico, a slightly cheeky toucan. And this suits the boy's shy nature very well. He is more comfortable with animals than with humans!

The complete opposite of his brother, Camilo! Nothing amuses him more than using his power of metamorphosis to take on the appearance of this or that person around him. Most often, he transforms himself to make his family and friends laugh. And it works! For hours, he puts on little magic shows in which he becomes, in turn, a neighbor, a cousin or a local shopkeeper.

Changing his appearance is not Camilo's only passion. He also loves sports and music. Whenever he has the chance, he goes to town with his father, Felix, to play a game of ball or tejo, the traditional Colombian petanque, with the other teenagers.

But what he loves most of all is when a catchy melody of cumbia, mapalé, salsa resounds or vallenato. He immediately starts singing and dancing! However, Camilo has one regret: he doesn't know how to play any musical instrument.

And that bothers him a lot…

Every day, Camilo goes to the main square of Encanto to listen to the local vallenato band. On stage, four musicians each play a different instrument. The first is on the guitar, the second on the accordion while the third uses a guacharaca, a traditional wooden instrument, on which he rubs a wire comb.

The last one is a young woman who is enthusiastically hitting the surface of a caja, a drum that she holds between her knees. And what an atmosphere!

The music captivates the spectators, seated on chairs in front of the small stage. Everyone admires the talent of the artists, their sense of rhythm, their joy of playing together on stage. Camilo is impressed. If only he knew how to handle an instrument too. He could put on a show while exercising his passion!

One day, while he was carefully observing the agile movements of the musicians, a thought came to him: ""Maybe I could learn the accordion by memorizing the gestures of the accordionist... It doesn't have to be rocket science…”

Just open and close the arms to operate the central bellows of the instrument. Moving the fingers on the small buttons and the keyboard located on either side, on the other hand, is more difficult to understand...

Luckily, Camilo never runs out of ideas.

To better see the accordionist's technique,
He decides to sit in the front row. And to avoid being recognized, he will take on the appearance of someone else!

Thus, the teenager returns in the guise of José, an inhabitant of Encanto with a very neat appearance: moustache, straight hair combed back, frank gaze...

With a detached air, as natural as possible, and without speaking to anyone, Camilo goes to sit at the foot of the stage where the vallenato players will perform in a few minutes. But he had barely settled in when voices rose up behind him.

“José, could you move, please? You're blocking our view.”

Camilo turns around and sees several women staring at him with an annoyed look. He has forgotten that José was very, very tall! No doubt, he bothers the other spectators. 

It is impossible to follow the concert in the front row under this appearance. He must find another solution.

The next day, Camilo has a new idea. To make sure he doesn't disturb anyone, he's going to take on the features of a small inhabitant. A child, for example! After a few tests in front of his bedroom mirror, he decides to transform himself into Juancho.

Delighted with his choice, he goes to the main square of Encanto, without forgetting to take a coffee cup, the essential accessory to embody his character.

Everything is going great! Camilo sits in the front row, without blocking anyone's view. The artists enter the stage and begin their first song. Camilo follows with his eyes the slightest movements of the accordionist's fingers, which dance on the keys of the instrument.

Soodain, there is a racket in the audience: we hear the noise of chairs, protests, whispers... Camilo, imperturbable, keeps his eyes fixed on the accordion when a firm hand grabs his arm. It's Juancho's mother! Furious, she forces him to get up and drags him through the streets of Encanto. It's then that Camilo understands: choosing the appearance of a child. 

It was not a good idea. 

Instead of attending a concert, Juancho should have been at home doing his homework!It was not a good idea.

Once again, the teenager must find another solution to learn to play music.

From then on, every day, Camilo takes on the features of a new inhabitant of the Encanto. He transforms into Abuela Guzmán but, immediately, the villagers come to question him about the marriage of his son, Mariano, with Isabela.

Then, he adopts the appearance of Don Osvaldo. But, once again, it is impossible to attend the concert in peace: his neighbors constantly interrupt him to ask him for favors. Camilo even goes so far as to pretend to be the priest of the Encanto but he changes his mind when he is asked to celebrate mass.

The boy is about to give up. He will never be able to observe the musicians' technique long enough to be inspired by it. Unless...it was one last idea, but it's a bit risky…

The next afternoon, when Mirabel, Camilo's cousin, goes to town to buy wool, she gets quite a surprise. There, sitting at the foot of the stage where the vallenato group is performing, she sees...her double! She can't believe her eyes!

Quickly, she walks up the central aisle, towards the front row. She clears her throat and, with a raised eyebrow, says:

“Hello, Mirabel. I really like your glasses!”

“Thank you!” Camilo replies without thinking.

Then he freezes before slowly turning around to find himself face to face with the real Mirabel who is watching him, looking angry. Failed again!

This time, the boy is out of solutions. He leaves the main square with a gloomy expression. He has to get used to it. He will never learn to play the accordion.

Back at Casita, Camilo decides to go see Mirabel to explain himself. He goes upstairs and knocks on her bedroom door. After being invited in, he turns the handle and enters the room. Since Mirabel does not have any magical powers, her room does not provide access to a universe enchanted, but it is warm and filled with multi-colored fabrics that she uses to create beautiful clothes.

Camilo walks over to the bed and sits down with a sigh. He explains to his cousin that he would love to play music, and that it was this dream that pushed him to transform into different people.

“I am happy to use my power to be of service,” he explains. “But I would also like to use it to play the accordion!”

“No doubt, musicians have a gift, which is called talent.” Mirabel replies. “But they also have something else, which is not magical.”

Camilo is intrigued. What does Mirabel mean?

He follows her with his eyes as she walks towards a large chest in the corner of the room.

“Perseverance” adds the young girl. “They are good musicians because they took the time to learn and practice. Like me!”

With that, she holds up a lovely accordion. Her cousin's face lights up.

“So you mean...I could learn!”

Then he touches the keys with his fingertips, without daring to press. He looks up at Mirabel and, full of hope, asks:

“Would you be my teacher?”

From then on, the two cousins meet every day to play music. Mirabel is very patient. She teaches Camilo the basics of music theory: do, re, mi…

Then she shows him how to handle the keys and bellows of the accordion. The boy has to try it many times!

Most often, at first, it's horrible OUUUAAAAAAAC that escapes from the instrument. Everyone in Casita has to cover their ears during lessons. Antonio's animals run to take refuge in their nests or burrows except Chispi, who stays impassive, as always!

But as the days went by, the young musician progressed more and more. He learned to produce chords and soon he knew how to play a few simple pieces. Mirabel accompanied him by beating time with her foot. And, little by little, the other members of the family came to attend the lessons instead of avoiding them.

After a few weeks of hard work, Mirabel announces to her cousin that he is ready to perform in front of a real audience. And she has great news: the vallenato group offers to play with them at their next concert! Camilo is over the moon, he can hardly believe it.

He devotes the few days that separate him from the next performance to perfect his technique. When the evening of the show finally arrives, he feels ready.

For this somewhat special concert, the Encanto was decked out in its finest attire.

Fairy lights adorn the main square of the village and all the inhabitants are dressed to the nines. The entire Madrigal family has come to attend Camilo's first performance!

Besides, there's a real crowd that's rushing this evening at the show. All the seats are taken, and some spectators even have to stand. The rumor redoubles when the musicians enter the stage and among them...Camilo, who proudly holds his accordion!

Applause rings out to encourage the artists, then silence falls. In the front row, Mirabel watches her cousin attentively. Unlike the time when the latter had taken her features, she is impatient to attend the performance.

The guitarist steps forward and introduces the special guest of the evening: Camilo Madrigal! Then the music begins..

Camilo is anxious. But, as soon as the first notes sound, the stage fright gives way and Camilo relaxes.

Mirabel, for her part, is overwhelmed with pride! She admires the agility of her cousin's fingers as they run over the keys of the keyboards, and his ample and assured movements as he operates the bellows. Above all, the melody who rises from his accordion eat magnificent

But the most joyful.

It's reading the joy on Camilo's face.

With his eyes closed and a big smile on his lips, the boy enjoys himself while playing his favorite instrument. Around him, the other musicians happily follow his tempo and let themselves be won over by his enthusiasm, to the cheers of the Madrigal family.

Until the end of the night. The melody fills the Encanto and the hearts of all its inhabitants. And, with each new chord, Camilo winks at his cousin Mirabel to thank her for having given hi .

1ij3qxd,https://www.reddit.com/r/PCOS/comments/1ij3qxd/read_this_if_youre_overwhelmed/,Read this if you're overwhelmed,"TLDR: you can heal  
sorry this is a novel- i feel like the details matter.   
  
I've been a long time member of the PCOS community. There seems to be a huge uptick in folks getting diagnosed (which is great) and realizing that their symptoms are valid, whether it be weight gain, infertility, acne, hair loss, unwanted hair growth, etc... A lot of people are wanting to manage this shitty thing, but many are understandably discouraged, don't know where to start, or are being led down a path of bandaid solutions by their egregiously uneducated GYN's, PCPs or Endos.

I am someone who watched a family member develop PCOS, not manage it, and subsequently develop Cushing's Disease. As I started to develop symptoms, I knew I didn't want to go down that path and I was fortunate for two reasons: I developed PCOS in a time where it was being talked about more, albeit minimally, and two; another family member of mine began attending medical school to be a Naturopathic Doctor as my health began to deteriorate so she is/was an incredible guiding light.

I want to put as much info as I've acquired through my Naturopathic Doctor sister, my personal research and my actual Naturopathic Doctor that I pay to see, in one place. Obviously, take what you want and leave the rest but my hope is this: to put all of this info in one spot for people to reference, and that everyone reading takes away that yes it sucks, but this is a condition that can be managed in MOST cases, and birth control/metformin/GLP1s aren't going to HEAL anything. Can they be tools and resources? YES, but doctors aren't presenting them as such, they most often tote them as a quick fix that gets you out of their office until its time to make babies. I see so many posts of people in such despair and hopelessess; if that's you, please know you don't have to feel that way forever. I know not everyone has access to health insurance, and naturopaths or bandwidth to do a bunch of research, so hopefully this is helpful for even one person.

So with that said:

Here were my symptoms beginning in \~2020 ( I was 20) :  
Hair thinning, facial hair growth, weight gain, missed periods (averaged every 60/70 days between), extremely heavy and painful when they did happen, spotting for up to 100 days at a time, dermatographia, hidradenitis suppurativa, insomnia, extreme sugar cravings, vitamin and nutritional malabsorption as shown through bloodwork, leaky gut, acid reflux, high A1C, high SED rate, acne, never satiated/no fullness cues, joint inflammation and pain, high blood pressure, cysts on my left ovary, constant dehydration, very easily getting sick

My lifestyle at the time:  
Sedentary: pandemic, and first time working an office job, not regularly going for walks or working out  
Diet: 50% high carb meals cooked at home- think pasta+ protein, or rice/potato + meat + veggie style meals and then 50% take out/drinks/sweets: frequently drinking sugary coffees, eating ice cream or cookies for dessert, getting takeout for lunch at work, drinking 3-4 coffees/day (so, the standard american diet LOL)  
Sleep: Getting into bed around 11, not being able to fall asleep until 1- up at 8am  
Stress: high- academically, having moved out for the first time, first ""real"" job, recovering from a challenging childhood... you get it

Growing up:  
Food: I grew up in poverty, my mom cooked every meal for us out of whole foods - go her!- but carbs are cheaper than protein so my diet consisted of meat/veggie/carb meals with significantly more access to the carb side of the plate to fill up  
Stress: High! Top tier student, impoverished family, athlete, stressful family dynamic  
Activity level: highly active; multiple sports, running, lifting etc

The downward spiral into PCOS and more:  
Eating disorder in highschool: Orthorexia/Over Exercising followed by depression and binge eating disorder. Weight went from >!126lbs to 285 !<over the course of 6 years. Rapidly started gaining weight in \~2016  
Highly stressed beginning in 2016 for many reasons  
Majorly lost my ability to exercise through chronic injury beginning in 2016  
Insulin resistance begins

I give all of this backstory to show just how important it is to see how things develop. When you see it all written out, it's obvious that something would begin to go wrong in the body. Modern medicine is beginning to acknowledge that PCOS is an expression of a multiple system failure and when we address it as such, we can begin to put people on a path to actual healing.

So here's what I did, simplified, redacting the trial and error for the sake of whoever is reading this novel. For clarity's sake, I didn't make all of these changes at once, I tried and failed many times, and I edited along the way:  
Water with electrolytes everyday, mutliple times a day  
High quality multivitamin (Pure)- Inflammatone (Designs for Health)  
Eat low carb/keto- I do not count calories: I bettered my diet over about 2.5 years before getting to this point, this was a very hard process that included reducing processed foods, reducing carbs, reducing caffeine intake, not taking sugar in my coffee, eating more protein, etc, all over a very long time period. Quitting weed helped a lot because no more munchies. INSULIN RESISTANCE AND GLUCOSE SPIKES ARE YOUR WORST ENEMY- please research this further for yourself, I'm not a Dr. (Glucose Goddess on IG is amazing, her podcast on DOAC is a great intro to her)  
Occasionally fast (12-16 hours)  
Minimized exposure to endocrine disruptors; I use natural soaps, detergents, no candles, rarely use perfume and makeup outside of mascara/natural makeup brands  
Movement: frequent walks, lifting, swimming, etc, zero exercise as punishment  
Learned about MCAS and Histamine issues: I think this is one my greatest issues that caused the expression of PCOS- I no longer eat avocados and frequently avoid many other high histamine foods like red sauce because I know my body struggles with this.  
Prioritize sleep and rest THIS IS SO IMPORTANT; I'm an 8.5 hour gal, 9 if I'm in my luteal phase. try to get my eyes on the early morning light and sunset light everyday (circadian rhythm regulation)  
Acknowledge and honor my menstrual cycle- give myself more rest in my luteal phase, lean into more movement in my follicular phase, continue to move gently after day 2 of my period  
Therapy, specifically somatic therapy. It's hard to come across, if you don't have access a helpful tool is The Tapping Solution

How I feel today:  
No dermatographia, no hidradenitis suppurativa (occassional flares with stress), my hair has grown back, I still have facial hair that I wax, although it's lessening (I think I will try to expedite this with spearmint tea/supplement). I get my period every \~30 days, it's five days long, minimal cramping, 2 days heavy, three medium to light. Ovulating monthly, losing weight, reduced joint pain, fantastic digestion, no acid reflux better skin/less acne, no leaky gut, lowered A1c, Blood Pressure and normal range SED rate, rare sugar cravings, incredibly reduced food noise which I really never thought would be possible. Better outlook on life, more positive, happier, not constantly stressed and feeling like my body is failing me.

Ultimately, I am grateful that PCOS told me to listen to my body; that's all it is, your body trying to get your attention. When I first went to the ND (which was hella expensive so let me pass this advice on for free), he ran one million and a half labs and I had high markers that showed I was trending towards Lupus. That shit is scary, that marks the start of the territory of needing medication for your entire life. Did PCOS cause that? Nope. PCOS is often the amalgamation of different things going wrong that we've given a pretty acronym so we can put people on birth control and call it a day. Untreated PCOS can develop into a whole array of things that guarantee you as a lifelong pharma customer ... I won't go into a rant about western medicine because this is truly already so long and you do not care, and because I 100% believe it's useful in a lot of cases, but I'll end it here: you can heal, you know your body, and it's not your fault, but you are the only person coming to save you so it is your responsibility if you want to feel better to take matters into your own hands.

Growing up, we had well water, I drank a lot of soda, didn’t brush before bed, and didn’t floss much. On top of that, it seems like I have naturally weak and sensitive teeth. Around the age of 19-20, I started taking my oral health more seriously after needing fillings in almost every tooth, along with a root canal.

Last year, I got health insurance through my new job, so I saw a dentist after a few years of not going. It turns out I have about 24 fillings to be done (I’ve already had 4 done, so 20 left). Apparently, my previous dentist didn’t do a thorough job—many of my old fillings had decay and air bubbles around them. While most of the cavities are ""kissing cavities"" and not very deep, a few in the back are deeper and may eventually need crowns.

I tend to take a ""burn-the-bridge-when-we-get-there"" approach, but now I really need to focus on my oral health. I’ve been more consistent with flossing after lunch at work, using mouthwash after coffee, and keeping up with my routine after meals. I also feel better about the fact that I will now be able to actually go get them checked on/cleaned twice a year. But, I can’t help but feel a little anxious about the long-term health of my teeth. Other than my cavities, my teeth are aesthetically pleasing and in pretty good shape overall, and I can't imagine losing them.

Beyond top-notch at-home care, are there any other steps I can take to preserve my teeth? I’d love to hear any advice. Thanks!",1,1738851964.0,Toothfully,1,1.0,False

I've been drinking a lot of tea lately, too. I'm trying to see what is the best stuff to out in tea for taste and for health. Just started growing some herbs to put in the tea. Coffee, I recently tried grinding beans, and it really does make a huge difference. So, I've been trying different coffee beans to see what's best.

I'm in the process of setting up a fish tank room. I have 4 tortoises that also live in the fish tank room until I build them an outside enclosure. 

I'm into video games, too. I mainly play Marvel Rivals, Valorant, Overwatch, Fortnite, and CS2. I built a PC to play on a couple of years ago. I also have a switch that I play pokemon and mario games mainly on. Just got a steam deck, too, and been tinkering around with it.

1ij3ntt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Zepbound/comments/1ij3ntt/nsv_clothes_and_comments/,NSV - Clothes and Comments,"A couple of days ago I shared an NSV about my BP medication being reduced.  That is still going well, and while the BP has been on the uptick slightly, it is still safely below the threshold that my Dr and I set. 

  
This morning, however, I had two separate NSVs that happened on my way to work.  First, none of my clothes fit anymore.  I look like a kid wearing my dad's clothing, which is awesome and slightly annoying (I am sure someone here can relate!).  I stopped at the gas station to fill up my truck and noticed that part of my shirt had come untucked and was hanging out the back of my pants.  I then noticed it was because my pants were too baggy and my belt needed tightening.  The context here is that I have been on the second to last hole on my belt for about two months now.  I haven't been able to comfortably tighten it anymore, but in the last few weeks I have known it was coming soon.   Well, sure enough, I was able to tighten it down to the last hole and did a fist-pump right there by the gas pump.  

  
The second NSV was that on my way into the store to grab some coffee, I held the door open for a group of folks walking out.  One of the guys coming out said to me ""Thank you, young Man.""  The context here is that I always get some thank you along with a comment on my size:  ""Thanks big man"" or ""Good looking out big dog"" or something like that.  The fact that they didn't comment on my size was shocking enough to me that it had stuck all morning.    To be clear, I am still what most people would consider big, and  I always have been.  I am 6' 2"", I have broad shoulders, and even when I was much lighter and working out in High School, I was still 195 to 200, was always in the 99th percentile of weight for my height, and up until junior year in college, my Dr was concerned I was underweight for my frame.  I am an imposing physical presence wherever I go, no matter what weight I am at.  I say this so that you know I have had people comment on my size as far back as I can remember.  Having someone just acknowledge who I was instead of how I looked feels like a huge accomplishment. ",47,1738851786.0,Zepbound,7,0.98,False

So we ended up having sex in the car that night and then the next day we met up around 12 AM, talked and did it in the car again and then the third day, we agreed to go to the beach for the last time and then stop seeing each other, but he brought his baby with him to the beach, which was very weird and we spent the day at the beach and got food and it was nice, but obviously very strange. He was need up taking a break from her for the week and stopped at his moms which is round the corner from mine, and we’ve still been seeing each other every night since then ( nearly a full week) having sneaky links and some nighttime talks and he’s been really open and said a lot things which have served a good purpose for me as in getting over him emotionally and putting things to bed, butt we just keep meeting and having sex in the car, but he’s still with his girlfriend and he still has a child with her and he lives with her. Last night after we did it, she rang and was asking him to come home and do it with her, which he said he would go over.

1ij3lh9,https://www.reddit.com/r/RL_Shine/comments/1ij3lh9/i_like_stepping_on_bugs_and_ive_done_much_worse/,"I like stepping on bugs, and I've done much worse ~ ! Tee hee -_^","I found this in my saved posts, so much to clean up and organize of late, but yeah, my number one favorite thing other than walking around barefoot in the spring and summer outside in town and forests is to step on bugs and kill them - more than books, coffee, flowers, night, gaming, my number one favorite thing is stepping on bugs.

I've made it into a hobby by practicing chasing them with my bare feet (which yes, I do step on them with, but usually have shoes on and kill them with shoes on too) with mixing dance with acrobatics with martial arts all into one thing I'm just calling Rebeccan Stomp for now, ballet with parkour with capoeira all in one, and I'll chase bugs around, especially like roaches at night in parks under picnic duck outs, kill hundreds a night, perfect target practice since they move and change direction so fast - I will do backflips and cartwheels to land my feet on them.

I also like killing and torturing them other ways, though - I do take a shit on them when I find them in the bathroom, or a piss, but if I'm living alone I'll not flush but just close the seat and lid and let them stew in there and suffer, which actually does hurt them, burns them through seeping into their body through the exoskeleton like being on fire but also preserves them and keeps them alive longer, which makes it more mean and so it's more fun and funny, and will flush when he's dead or it's full and just keep reusing it until then without flushing.

If you're a mom and have boys that you wanna take hunting the SLF in the northeast US in spring and summer between stomping them, you can collect them in a bottle and then on the trip back have your sons pee into the bottle of them alive as a piss bottle - or you can have your daughters do that if there aren't sons and use a FUD or the boys just close their eyes if you have both - girl's don't have to close for boys, they can watch if they want.

Also if your girls express and interest in stepping on or killing bugs in creative ways, then I'd encourage you let them and give them space and attention for it - but if they don't then don't force them to, but especially if you are the mother, if you or your daughters don't wanna or don't want to in any particular moment, then I'd encourage you to force your son or sons to step on them, especially if they don't want to or are super shy or even afraid, it will break that for them, and besides you'll enjoy watching him step on them for you, but I wouldn't give boys a choice, and you or your daughter can record it for the memory or direct him to step on them as you both have him tackle them - that's how it was in my family.

I'd just let them know this is only for bugs, and not all of them, and which ones are friends - other than that girls can do it too, but it's not like a progressive thing to force, that's bad.

I'll also use them as lotion for the more juicy and less crunchy ones, whenever I need foot lotion they're actually super rich nutrients for the skin on your feet which is very different from the rest of your body, and if I'm feeling horny I can use them collected and fed and aired in a jar as lube and crush them alive as lotion for my dick and balls, super smooth and fun and funny to do for me.

I'm also a good shot, I can piss on bugs mid-air or on a wall or wherever that are like the distance of across a street if I do it right, including high up too - and so naturally when I masturbate I can control the shot and have target practiced enough with flies mid-air where I can take 'em out mid-flight with my cum, super cool and then he's just stuck on the ground or floor with goo, and I tend to let him suffer but if I'm in the mood I'll just step on him and move on.

The other thing I'll do is catch them and put them in a big two liter bottle and pour a little oil in there, shake it up around, put holes for small breathing in the bottom and a mesh down there and put the bottom back on and the sides not enough to get out and a little bit of food and water, then when there's enough bugs in there, when I gotta fart what I'll do is unscrew the lid and take out the bottom so the mesh is the only thing that's left and I'll take a small tube with a hole in the side and record this on video, put one end into my ass and the other into the top of the bottle having it sideways, and then put a lighter in the gap on the side, light it and fart as hard as I can and watch like 30 different living bugs get lit on fire with a huge fireball blowing out the bottom into the air bigger than spray deodorant and that, and the bugs scamper around and burn up in the bottle over five minutes of a calmer fire, and just laugh the whole time watching them die.

And you can also just lay down wedge them between your butt-cheeks and when you gotta fart light a lighter and the flame will actually go back as well as the normal front and flamethrower him out rather than a normal flame burst and it sounds like a paper being crumbled up with a squeal (which is him in pain) and super cool.

Let's see, haha, there's a few other things, and they don't come to mind right now but I'm sure I can just edit them in later if I feel like it. I love all things with fur, feathers, scales, or amphibians, but some crustaceans and all but a few bugs - spiders, ladybugs, butterflies all get passes - are toys for me.

I like being mean to bugs \~ !

1ij3iwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/skincaredevices/comments/1ij3iwe/red_light_therapy_infrared_light_therapy_wrap/,Red Light Therapy Infrared Light Therapy Wrap Belt YD001 review does it hold up?,"For months, I’ve been curious about the benefits of red light therapy, so I decided to give the Red Light Therapy Infrared Light Therapy Wrap Belt by feangli a shot. The model YD001 is marketed as a solution for body pain relief, inflammation reduction, and muscle repair. After consistent use, I have some thoughts on its design and functionality, along with areas that could use improvement.

This device is a wearable therapy belt that claims to deliver professional-grade red and infrared light therapy. With its 660nm red light and 850nm infrared light, it promises to penetrate the skin and muscles to promote healing and reduce pain. I’ve been testing this belt daily, especially after long hours hunched over my desk, and here’s my take.

[Check Red Light Therapy Infrared Light Therapy Wrap Belt price on Amazon here.](https://agegene.com/product-reviews/red-light-therapy-belt-review-b09xcx2vsp/)

**Design & Build Quality**  
The belt is surprisingly lightweight, at just over a pound, and feels durable in hand. The exterior is made of stretchy neoprene material, which gives it a snug fit around the body. However, I noticed that it doesn’t stretch as much as I’d hoped—potentially a downside for users with larger waist sizes. It’s designed to be adjustable, but the stiffness can make it a bit uncomfortable to maneuver, especially if you’re not in the mood to wrestle with it. The transparent TPU film covering the red lights is a thoughtful touch, as it protects the chips from sweat and oil. Aesthetically, it’s not bad—sleek and low-profile enough to wear discreetly around the house.

**Ease of Use**  
Setting it up was straightforward. The belt connects to a USB port, and you can plug it into a power bank, laptop, or wall outlet. The remote control is intuitive, with clear buttons for adjusting the heat/light levels and setting the timer. I usually opt for the 30-minute session, which is the maximum recommended duration. It’s worth noting that the long cord can be both a blessing and a curse–great for mobility but occasionally tangles if you’re not careful.

**Performance & Effectiveness**  
I started using the belt primarily for lower back pain, and after the first session, I felt a noticeable reduction in stiffness. The combination of the 660nm and 850nm lights appears to work as advertised—targeting both surface-level and deeper pain. While it doesn’t perform miracles (don’t expect to feel like a new person overnight), it does provide a soothing warmth that helps ease tension. After a particularly rough day of gardening, it worked wonders on my tired muscles. However, I wouldn’t say it replaces more intensive physical therapy, but it’s a decent supplement.

**Comfort**  
The belt emits a gentle warmth, which is quite comforting during use. It’s not overwhelmingly hot, even at the highest setting. However, the material’s rigidity makes it less comfortable for extended wear, particularly if you’re moving around a lot. I found it best to use while sitting or lying down. My coworker tried it on their shoulder and noted that the belt didn’t conform well to more angular body parts—better for flat areas like the back or stomach.

**Battery Life & Charging**  
One feature I appreciate is the versatility of charging options. Plugging it into a power bank made it portable enough for me to use while walking around the house. Charging speed depends on the power source; using a wall adapter is noticeably faster than relying on a laptop USB port. I haven’t encountered any issues with overheating or malfunctioning, which is a definite plus considering the daily use.

**Additional Features**  
The timer setting is a lifesaver for someone as forgetful as me. The remote control is easy to operate, and the four heat/light levels offer enough variety to cater to different preferences. I also like that it’s large enough to cover a significant treatment area, but it’s still compact enough to fold up and stash in a drawer. One quirky feature is that it’s pet-friendly—yes, you can supposedly share this with your furry friends. I haven’t tested this on my dog (yet), but it’s worth mentioning!

**Safety & Skin Sensitivity**  
The TPU film is a thoughtful addition, ensuring that the light doesn’t irritate the skin. During my sessions, I didn’t experience any redness or discomfort. That said, I did adhere to the 30-minute limit strictly. The device seems safe for regular use, though the manufacturer advises against direct contact with water, so don’t spill your coffee on it.

**Pros**

* Provides noticeable pain relief and muscle relaxation.
* Versatile charging options make it portable and convenient.
* Adjustable strap fits various body parts reasonably well.
* Timer setting prevents overuse.
* Includes both red and infrared light for comprehensive therapy.

**Cons**

* The material is stiff, making it slightly uncomfortable for extended use.
* Strap adjustability could be improved for larger users.
* Doesn’t conform well to angular body areas like shoulders or knees.
* Requires consistent use for significant results.
* Some may find the cord cumbersome during use.

**Comparison to Competitors**  
I’ve tried similar red light therapy devices, and the YD001 stands out for its combination of portability and functionality. Compared to bulkier devices like the Joovv Mini or the Mito Red Light, this belt is much more user-friendly for targeting specific areas. However, competitors like the Hooga Red Light Panel offer more extensive treatment areas but lack the portability of a wearable design. Where the YD001 excels is its hands-free usability, but it falls short in terms of flexibility compared to wraparound designs by brands like LifePro.

**Cost Analysis and Value for Money**  
Considering the features and performance, the YD001 sits at a reasonable price point for red light therapy devices. While it’s not the cheapest option, it offers a good balance between quality and affordability. Competitors with similar functionalities often cost significantly more, so this belt is a solid investment if you’re looking to dip your toes into red light therapy without breaking the bank. Given its durability and effectiveness, I’d say it’s worth the expense—provided you’re patient enough to use it consistently.

so this morning I decided to reach out to Kenzie and try to talk things out. We met up for coffee and had an honest conversation about the fight. She apologized for her mean comments about my outfit, but she also admitted that she felt justified in being honest with me. I tried to explain that there's a balance between being honest and being cruel, but she just didn't seem to get it. As the conversation went on, I could feel a strain in our friendship. Kenzie still thought I was being oversensitive about her comments, while I felt frustrated that she just didn't seem to understand the impact her words had on me. We eventually ended the conversation without really resolving anything and went our separate ways. Since then, our friendship has been kind of awkward. We still hang out in a group setting, but things are definitely different now. Kenzie doesn't make as many comments about my outfits anymore, but the tension between us is pretty palpable. It's like we both know there's still unresolved issues but neither of us really knows how to address them. The rest of our mutual friends have picked up on the tension as well. They try to stay out of it, but it's hard not to notice the elephant in the room whenever Kenzie and I are in the same place. It's like everyone is tip-toeing around us, afraid of saying the wrong thing and causing another argument. As hard as I try to act like everything is fine, I can't help but feel like this whole situation has really hurt our friendship. It's like the trust and closeness we used to have has been chipped away, leaving us with this awkward, strained dynamic. I wish we could go back to the way things were before this whole mess started. As time goes on, I find myself distancing myself more and more from Kenzie. I feel like I just can't be myself around her anymore, and that's really sad to me. We've been friends for so long, but it feels like she doesn't really ""get"" me anymore. I keep trying to tell myself that maybe we just grew apart, but part of me wonders if this fight was just the catalyst for something that was just simmering under the surface the whole time. It's like, when I think back on our relationship, there were definitely moments of tension and disagreements before this incident. But I always just wrote them off as minor bumps in the road. But now I'm starting to wonder if those bumps were actually signs of bigger problems all along. I feel like our friendship is at a crossroads right now. I wonder if we can work through this and get back to a good place, or if this fight has irreparably changed things. Every time I see her, I feel a pang of sadness and nostalgia for the way things used to be. But at the same time, I can't help but feel this anger and resentment towards her for making all those mean comments and not understanding why they hurt me. It feels like we're stuck in this limbo of trying to act like nothing has changed, but both of us knowing it has. I've been replaying that night in my head over and over again, wondering what could have been done differently. But no matter how many times I analyze it, I always come back to the same conclusion: this fight has irrevocably changed our friendship.
