1n15uff,https://i.redd.it/tpastchp8hlf1.png,Awesome UK Indie Artists Playing Sept 9th at Afterglow Coffee in Scott's Addition,"This is the third event I'm sharing on Reddit and honestly, been amazed at the overwhelmingly positive response to the other two, so fingers crossed this one gets similarly positive vibes as well.

I'm putting on a show for a good friend of mine,¬†[Katie Malco](https://katiemalco.bandcamp.com), who hails from the UK and will be touring in the US next month. She's previously toured supporting the likes of Julien Baker, Alvvays, The Lumineers, Bob Mould, Peter Buck of REM, etc. Also playing will be another UK (and Hong Kong) artist named¬†[mui zyu](https://muizyu.bandcamp.com), who is visiting the US for the first time I believe. Rounding out the bill is local songwriter¬†[Andy Jenkins](https://andyjenkins.bandcamp.com), who's great if you're not already aware of him.

I've linked each of their names to their respective Bandcamp pages, so you can check out the tunes.

Because it's at Afterglow Coffee, the capacity is fairly limited, so if you wanted to grab a ticket in advance, that would be greatly appreciated and guarantee you get in. Not sure if this will sellout, but it very well might. Tickets available on Eventbrite. (I had included the link in my first attempt to post this, but it was flagged, so thinking that may have been why?! Anyone that knows better let me know?)

Thanks in advance for this communities ongoing kindness to the random events I've been posting about and for supporting independent, international touring musicians.",1,1756263449.0,rva,0,1.0,False
1n15u7m,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sjogrens/comments/1n15u7m/difficulty_eating_during_flares/,Difficulty eating during flares,"I was dx in November after having sialadenitis and getting my lymph node biopsied. I'm 29yo otherwise healthy my whole life. Worst symptoms are dry eyes, sometimes dry mouth, joint pain, and fatigue. I don't smoke or drink any alcohol. I limit coffee to a 1/2  cup or 1 cup a day depending on my mood. 

The fatigue makes it really hard for me to bother with cooking. I end up eating very little every day. I manage a few bites of food and I tend to eat crappy foods tbh. 

I eat a lot of dairy because it has a lot of calories and is easy for me to pick up and eat. I also like fruits that are easy to eat like bananas and apples. 

I have some weird hang-ups about food like sometimes I will get the ick about certain foods like eggs and avocados and avoid them like the plague. 

How do you deal with eating when in a flare and very fatigued? I know my diet right now is not helping me at all.

4am.

I throw myself out of bed, eyes still closed, and brain still booting up.

My bed looks like monkeys danced in it - pillows on the floor and blankets barely holding onto the edge of my mattress.

Purple bags hang under my eyes, to compliment the unintentional half updo I‚Äôm sporting after forgetting to free my hair after last night - how aesthetic.
I splash my face with cold water, cleanse and moisturize, aggressively brush my teeth, and release the rats nest on top of my head.
A quick brush and a quick reset of a messy bun. Loose hair is a luxury I don‚Äôt have because heaven knows, I refuse to style it.
A quick check in the mirror and I‚Äôm ready to donn the pre-planned outfit on my dresser. 

4:12.

Move.
The leggings, sports bra, baggy white tee, and mismatched socks are on.

4:14.

I slide to my small but cozy kitchen and find my gray sweater hanging on the chair. I pull it over my head and shove my wallet and keys in my pocket.

4:18.

An apple and instant coffee will do today. I‚Äôm not too hungry anyways. No time for actual coffee.
I shove the apple in my mouth and start my car - frost on the windows and the blackness outside reminds me winter is approaching, and the world is coming to a pause.
I gnaw on the honeycrisp, sip my coffee, and hear my phone vibrate. 
I must‚Äôve forgot to turn my other alarm off, for fuck sakes.
I rip the device out of my hoodie pocket and look at the screen and see a green notification.
Who the hell is up at this hour? I guess I am.

4:28

I slide the screen up to check the notification but see something move behind me in the glare and pause.
I must be tired.
I open the alert and see a foreign number.

‚ÄòLittle bird, 
Oh how I love spending time with you.‚Äô

4:29 

I turn and look behind me.
Nothing. 
Maybe it would be better if someone was there, because I would have them to tell me what I can‚Äôt remember.

1. Does anyone have any inspo/ideas of how they store their mops/brooms/vacuums/etc in their garage so it looks tidy? Whether it‚Äôs in a specific place or if you store them on shelves and such.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Carlos Alcaraz vs. Mattia Bellucci: A Foregone Conclusion with a Side of Absurdity**

Ladies, gentlemen, and sentient tennis balls, prepare for a match that‚Äôs as lopsided as a wobbly Jell-O mold. Carlos Alcaraz, the 19-year-old ATP titan with a shaved head sharper than his backhand, faces Mattia Bellucci, a 65th-ranked Italian who‚Äôs about to learn why ‚Äúwalkover‚Äù is a term reserved for pigeons, not Grand Slam upsets. Let‚Äôs break this down with the statistical rigor of a linesman and the humor of a comedian trapped in a stadium.

---

### Parsing the Odds: Why This Isn‚Äôt a Pick‚Äôem

The bookmakers have spoken, and they‚Äôve done so with the enthusiasm of a tax auditor: **Carlos Alcaraz is a +102 to +103 favorite** (decimal: 1.02‚Äì1.03). Translating that into implied probability? **\~97‚Äì98% chance of victory**. For context, that‚Äôs the same confidence level the average person has that their morning coffee won‚Äôt spill. Bellucci, meanwhile, is priced at **+12 to +19**, implying a **\~7‚Äì8% chance**. If you‚Äôre betting on Bellucci, you‚Äôre essentially wagering that Alcaraz will suddenly develop a fear of the letter ‚ÄúA‚Äù (as in *Ace*, *Aggression*, and *Alcaraz‚Äôs Unstoppable Dominance*).

The spread? Alcaraz is -8.5 games. Even if Bellucci played every point perfectly, he‚Äôd still need to win **nine games** just to cover. The total games line sits at **30.5**, meaning oddsmakers expect a best-of-five snoozefest. If you‚Äôre into that.

---

### Digesting the News: Bellucci‚Äôs Hope Is a Mirage

Let‚Äôs start with the positives for Bellucci: He‚Äôs Italian, which gives him *some* cultural advantage in New York (pizza, pasta, *ah, the aroma of success*). Beyond that? Not so much.

Bellucci advanced to this match via a **walkover** after Chinese qualifier Shang Juncheng retired injured. Great for his ATP ranking, worse for his confidence. Last week, he lost to Jaume Munar in Winston-Salem, a defeat so demoralizing it probably still echoes in his bathroom mirror.

Alcaraz? The 2022 US Open champ is on a **5-title roll this year**, including eight Masters 1000 trophies. He‚Äôs currently **100 points ahead of Jannik Sinner** in the race for year-end No. 1, and this match is a must-win to keep his crown chase aliv

Seriously. Before you dive headfirst into another ‚Äúplan‚Äù that promises to shred fat in 30 days or melt your muffin top with magic macros‚Ä¶ let‚Äôs take a breath.

Because if your **sleep is a mess**, you‚Äôre **barely drinking water**, and your **movement is hit or miss**, you‚Äôre basically trying to build a house on a cracked foundation.

And that‚Äôs why it doesn‚Äôt stick. That‚Äôs why it feels hard. That‚Äôs why you burn out by day 10 and find yourself elbow-deep in a family-sized block of chocolate wondering what‚Äôs wrong with you.

(Spoiler: Nothing. You're not broken. Your *approach*¬†is.)

So before you cut carbs or count a single calorie, **fix these 3 basics first.**

# 1. Sleep: You can't burn fat when you're exhausted.

You could be eating kale in your sleep and still not lose fat if you‚Äôre not actually *sleeping*.

When you're running on empty, your body clings to fat, especially around your belly. Cortisol (your stress hormone) spikes. Hunger hormones go wild. You crave sugar. You‚Äôre irritable. You make worse food choices ‚Äî and not because you're weak, but because your *brain is literally tired*.

**What to do:** Start aiming for 7‚Äì8 hours.Put your phone down 30 minutes earlier. Get some sunlight in the morning. Do *one*¬†thing to start honouring your rest ‚Äî it‚Äôs more powerful than any fat burner.

# 2. Water: You're not tired. You're dehydrated.

Most women I work with are *chronically*¬†dehydrated. And guess what? That fatigue, brain fog, sluggish metabolism, and ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm hungry again‚Äù feeling? Often it‚Äôs just a thirsty body pretending it needs food.

Water helps with digestion, cravings, energy, mood, fat burning ‚Äî literally everything.

**What to do:** Aim for 2‚Äì3 litres per day. Not coffee. Not Diet Coke. Actual water. Start your day with 500ml before anything else ‚Äî consider it your fat loss pre-game.

# 3. Movement: Stop thinking workouts are the only way.

If your Apple Watch isn‚Äôt logging a 45-minute HIIT session, you think it doesn‚Äôt count, right?

Wrong.

You don‚Äôt need a gym membership or fancy activewear. You just need to **move more**¬†throughout your day. Walk. Stretch. Dance in the kitchen. Take the stairs. Movement is what gets your body out of ‚Äústorage mode‚Äù and into ‚Äúlet‚Äôs use this energy‚Äù mode.

**What to do:** Start by walking 5‚Äì10 minutes after meals. It helps with digestion *and*¬†blood sugar regulation.You‚Äôll feel better ‚Äî and burn more ‚Äî with less stress on your body.

# Bottom line?

Fixing these 3 things doesn‚Äôt just ‚Äúprepare‚Äù you for fat loss ‚Äî they **create it.**

You don‚Äôt need to be perfect. You don‚Äôt need to overhaul your life. You just need to focus on the stuff that *actually works*.

Because when these pieces are in place, **everything else feels easier.**¬†You‚Äôre not fighting your biology anymore ‚Äî you‚Äôre finally working with it.

And *that‚Äôs*¬†when fat loss gets sustainable.",1,1756262680.0,MenopauseWeight,0,1.0,False

I am part-time at a newspaper as a reporter, I have a couple of business and media degrees, been in the business for 20 years, also currently finishing a music degree. I interview this beautiful girl for a poll question. She seems to dig me, I ask her out for coffee after the interview, she said no. Fair enough. I told her i'll be at open mic. Lo and behold a couple of weeks later, she shows up. Totally unexpected.

She really liked my songs, and we got to talking, I sat down at her table (she was there solo) Her eyes and face lit up a lot, she was leaning in, we joked, we flirted. We even talked about hanging out to do stuff. I also noticed she cleaned up some and had makeup on point, hair on point, was showing some cleavage, etc.

She is from the area, but was in Los Angeles for a while and just moved back, etc. etc. So I finally ask her out for some coffee and she was like ""no, i'm not trying to do all that"" I asked, and she does have a boyfriend. So, I was like ""oh, sorry, I didn't know"" and left it at that. Said, ""thanks for coming, i'll see you around!"" I was super grateful that she is supporting my music, she also is a musician and plays french horn, but currently is just a hostess at a local winery. She's probably 28-32 years old is my guess. I'm 45, but I look a lot younger. I also am more ""young at heart, punk rock type, etc."" I have surfed and skated for years, and been playing music for a long time too. Just recently got serious about the degree and learning music properly.

Also, I'm a bit on the spectrum, so it takes me a while to figure things out or not till later. She asked me when we were talking about wineries ""so you don't drink?"" I was like no, but don't mind if you do, as long as you don't get sloshed, hammered daily, etc. Do you think she was suggesting going to get a drink somewhere? Maybe she just wanted to hook up and just didn't want to date and all that? Maybe her boyfriend is in another city? I truly have no idea.

Maybe she was just a musician looking to make new friends? I am super stoked to have people come out and support my music, but at the same time, I haven't had any sort of intimate relations for over 3 years, so maybe I'm just kind of stir crazy and chomping at the bit and that's skewing my view of the situation?

I have only been playing music in front of people for about a year outside a college setting, so I wanted to get a musicians perspective on how to navigate this. Also, I'm in a small town, so I want to be very careful what I do, I also want to be professional to not make potential fans angry or cause static. At the same time, I am super starved for touch and affection in a lot of ways. Let's just say, I had a house in Texas, but COVID hit, my life changed, and the house had to be sold, and I am currently with my parents, moved to another state, getting them settled in from retirement, and going to go on from there and eventually purchase my own home again. just for now, I'm working and writing songs and playing in a couple of bands, so that really keeps me super busy. Plus, I am finishing one last class for my Commercial Music degree. So, there's also the weirdness of dating while living with my parents, which is just freaking awkward and I really don't want to do that right now. I want to be on my own, because otherwise it's just super lame.

I just get really lonely and touch/intimacy starved, but it makes for great songwriting! Any help is appreciated, thanks!",0,1756261450.0,musicians,27,0.37,False

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5‚Äô10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

My 2014 Honda Civic (109k) miles paid off was parked on the street in front of my home a bit behind my boyfriend‚Äôs car also on the same insurance 2013 Toyota. There is a four way stop sign a house down and the speed limit is 25 mph. Per the police report the officer was not speeding (i doubt the validity of this) but sustained a head cut and was taken to the hospital, no air bags deployed.

My boyfriend was working downstairs and heard the crash and saw the officer and spoke to officers who arrived within a few minutes. I was working in the loft and didn‚Äôt hear the accident but was downstairs within a few minutes. The cop hit the back corner of my car with the front corner of his vehicle pushing the rear end of my car over the curb and fully onto the sidewalk and into the rear of my bfs car. When I was investigating the scene I noticed a substance across the cops windshield, the cop in charge of investigating validated it was coffee which the cop was distracted by. My car was towed away to the police tow lot and instantly determined to be a total loss by my insurance as well as the accident being no fault as the government is not liable due to immunity üôÑ. It was taken into possession by insurance today from the tow lot.

*Where Fashion Fails and Forehands Reign*

---

### Parse the Odds: Tiafoe‚Äôs Immaculate Dominance

Frances Tiafoe isn‚Äôt just a favorite‚Äîhe‚Äôs a statistical inevitability. The betting lines paint him as a near-lock, with decimal odds hovering around **1.11** (equivalent to **-911** American odds), implying an **89.8% chance of victory**. For context, that‚Äôs more likely than your average coffee addict surviving a day without caffeine. Martin Damm Jr., the 21-year-old Grand Slam newbie, sits at **+6.5 to +7.13** odds (a **13.5‚Äì16.3% chance**), which is about the same odds as correctly guessing a stranger‚Äôs Spotify Wrapped in three tries.

Tiafoe‚Äôs resume at the US Open is nothing short of r√©sum√©-padding perfection: four straight quarterfinals, two semifinal berths (2022, 2024), and a 69% win rate here since 2020. Damm, meanwhile, is making his Grand Slam debut after eking out a first-round win over Yoshihito Nishioka. While that victory is as impressive as winning a pie-eating contest in a bakery, it‚Äôs not exactly a harbinger of a title run.

### Digest the News: Fashion Fails and Back Issues

Tiafoe‚Äôs first-round win over Yoshihito Nishioka was overshadowed by one glaring detail: his **bright-red outfit**, which fans mercilessly compared to Aryna Sabalenka‚Äôs racquet bag. One Twitter user wrote, ‚ÄúFrances looks like he dressed in a blindfold during a sale at Hot Topic.‚Äù Fortunately, his back‚Äîwhich forced him to withdraw from the Cincinnati Open‚Äîseems fine now. Post-match, he shrugged off the fashion critiques with the nonchalance of a man who‚Äôs more concerned with Grand Slam glory than haute couture.

Damm‚Äôs story is one of raw potential. The Czech prodigy earned his first Grand Slam win by defeating Darwin Blanch in straight sets, a performance so electrifying it made his family reconsider their entire life choices. But let‚Äôs not overst

Im a 31 year old man whos never had a romantic relationship and still sort of a virgin.   

This does not bring me joy, it does not make me feel ‚Äúunique‚Äù in anyway, it honestly feels like a curse. 

I feel like it would be a little easier if i was a girl whos demi maybe? But being a demisexual straight guy in the USA, in Nashville, TN no less‚Äîwhich is one of the most ‚Äúhook up‚Äù culture friendly states, really REALLY sucks. 

I have tried all the dating apps, the traditional ones like Tinder, Bumble, etc and the more specific ones like Match, Eharmony, Upward, etc, and i have had ZERO luck. And i literally mean zero, ive never had a single date with anybody and ive been on these apps for years. Ive gotten by bio and pictures looked at by ‚Äúpros‚Äù so i know my pics and bios arent the issue. 

So then what is the issue? To me it seems the issue is being a demisexual guy in the USA during the millennial/gen z generation.

When i get matches, which is LITERALLY once in a blue moon, i talk to women for a few days on the apps, then get their number and talk a little more maybe a phone call, but then they ghost me. EVery single time. Or if not, they friend zone me. I have literally sat and went through each and every message/text sent between me and my matches with my therapist to see if it is something im saying and its not. 

So what is it then?

I am not unattractive. I actually am above average level of attractive‚Äî and im not saying this to be pompous or arrogant in anyway, i have been told by many people i am. I work out, have abs, am 6‚Äô3, am an üáÆüáπItalian stallion (so thats +3 on my attractive scale xD), i play lead guitar in bands all around Nashville. 

So then what is it?

I am convinced its because im a demisexual GUY. Because being demi, i dont know how to flirt with women without it feeling forced and ‚Äúrobotic‚Äù. 

And yes i have tried traditional in person dating too. Ive been to a bunch of speed dating events. Whenever i have matched with someone there, i always end up getting friendzoned.

Its almost as if women seem to ‚Äúfeel‚Äù my demisexuality. Like a lack of libido thing or something. I always just give off little brother vibes with women or friend vibes. No sexual/romantic energy‚Ä¶

Im sorry if this post sounds angry, i just have been having a bad night. I, yet again, recenrely got ghosted by a girl that i had been talking to for about 3 weeks ago who seemed to really be interested in me. Then when i asked to go out for coffee or a movie, no response for two weeks and she unmatched me on the app.

So yes im sorry but i needed to vent. I apologize if this is triggering in anyway to anybody, i just dont know where else to vent this.

This situation will involve myself(Yellow) and girlfriend, my roommate (RM, Black), and my good friend and boss (boss, Red), there are a lot of others involved but it would involve a lot of organization and I'm not great at that. The Colors are for the texts Ill post.

I had been friends with RM for close to 5 years before I moved in with her. We always had a wonderful plutonic relationship, and when i found myself looking for somewhere to move and she needed a roommate it seemed like a great thing. Everything went great for the first couple of years and she even decided she loved my girlfriend so much she gave her a key. I was stoked about my girlfriend was going to get to move in with me and it wasnt going to have to wait for me to move. RM and I had similar interest in the same things in the beginning, mostly going out to play pool and getting a bag to share that kept us talking until late into the mornings. The best part, not an ounce of jealousy from my girlfriend (She wasnt a fan of the harder stuff, but does enjoy smoking with me).

Things were great for about 3 years, RM was super understanding of me being in a harder spot in life. She never flipped when rent was a couple weeks late, and I payed a super reasonable rate for the room. 500 a month with access to washer/dryer, kitchen, my own bathroom, was amazing in our area. Things got rough about 2 years ago when the AC died, RM was in the middle of a bankruptcy and dealing with the tail end of a DUI from years before i moved in, and couldnt afford a new one. I wasnt making enough to afford to replace it myself at the time so we bought widow units and delt with the southern heat for a couple years. I also quit drinking and doing cocaine (California Sober haha) in that time. Once things started to get worse for RM she asked if I could pay an extra 100 a month to help and I gladly agreed.

RM introduced me to my current Boss and good buddy around a year ago, in that time Ive been a big part in helping the business he started the year prior into the great success it is currently. As a reward he and his partner decided to make me a small partner in the business which came with a very large pay increase for me. Life changing for me in fact. My girlfriend quit her job, but we decided to not move so we could help RM for a while longer. Thats when things got horrible. RM would come home 2-3am with friends in tow to do bumps and come in and out being loud, I never complained as it was her home and she needed the fun.

She began attacking me through phone calls and texts every time she got messed up and felt like she didnt have enough money to make ends meet. She sees it as my fault for not just offering her money every time she has a want or need. I tried to help but I was also trying to save for my future. I payed for coffees, lunches, a car battery, and pitched in more money whenever i was able.

I travel for work and was working 2600 miles from home and the night i finish the job, I get berated by text claiming I had told everyone I was over charged for rent and she demanded 800 a month for the single bedroom with no AC because she had offers for 1000. I had never spoken to anyone about feeling overcharged and asked who had said. She told me Boss had said it, so i quickly walked to his room in the Air BnB and asked about it, he said he never said anything. I quit texting and dropped it until she informed me Boss had asked for a loan she had taken from him since she had been trying to drive a wedge between me and him for a while and this was the last straw. Ill post the pictures of the texts and let you judge. I tried to remain calm and civil, but she swears im the worst person alive for asking my boss about things he had supposedly said.

Magkaibigan kami noon, pero nagkahiwalay rin ang landas matapos ang graduation. Ilang taon na rin mula nang huli ko siyang naisip.

Kaya noong bigla akong nakatanggap ng mensahe mula sa kanya sa Facebook noong nakaraang Huwebes, una kong naramdaman ay gulat. Sumunod‚Äîkalituhan.

Ang nakalagay lang sa mensahe ay:

> ‚ÄúIkaw ito, ‚Äòdi ba?‚Äù



Sa ilalim noon ay may video file. Ang pamagat lang:
gasstation_footage_0313.mp4

üéûÔ∏è Ang Footage

Mukha itong karaniwang black-and-white na kuha mula sa security camera‚Äîwide angle, static shot ng loob ng isang gasolinahan. Alam mo na, yung tipikal: maingay na fluorescent lights, mga tsitsirya sa wire racks, isang malungkot na counter na may plastic divider.

Pinanood ko.

Sa timestamp na 3:12:48 AM, may pumasok na lalaki.

Naka-jeans, gray hoodie, at navy baseball cap. Medyo matigas kumilos, parang giniginaw o pagod. Dumaan siya sa tapat ng camera papunta sa coffee machine. Bahagyang lumingon.

Ako iyon.

Pinause ko ang video. Binalikan. Pinanood ulit.

Parehong-pareho ang tindig. Pareho ang jacket na halos araw-araw kong suot. Kita pa ang peklat sa ilalim ng panga ko‚Äîmula sa pagkahulog ko noong 2016.

Ako iyon.


---

‚è±Ô∏è Ang Timestamp

Tiningnan ko ulit ang timestamp.

Marso 13. 3:12 AM.
Apat na araw pa mula ngayon.

Noong una, akala ko biro lang. Deepfake? Inedit na footage? Pero‚Ä¶ masyadong kapani-paniwala.

Nag-reply ako kay Darren:

> ‚ÄúNakakatawa. Saan mo nakuha ‚Äòto?‚Äù



Hindi na siya sumagot.


---

ü©∏ Ang Katapusan

Pinagpatuloy ko ang video.

Nandoon, ako (o ang bersyon ko) ay kumuha ng kape, pumunta sa counter. Yung tindero‚Äîmatabang lalaking naka-hoodie‚Äîmay sinabi, pero hindi ko marinig.

Sumagot ang bersyon ko, halatang naiinis. Kumakampay ang kamay. Itinuro ng tindero ang camera. Yumuko ang doble ko, halatang galit na galit.

Bigla, humugot ng kung ano ang tindero mula sa ilalim ng counter.

Baril.

May kislap. Bumagsak yung tao (ako?)‚Äîlumabas sa frame.

Lumabas mula sa counter ang tindero. Hinila niya ang katawan sa braso‚Äîmga braso ko‚Äîhanggang sa muli itong bahagyang makita.

Basag ang ulo. Hindi gumagalaw.

Nag-cut ang feed.


---

üß† ‚ÄúPalagi Mo Itong Makikita‚Äù

Kinabukasan, buong araw kong sinubukang tawagan si Darren. Walang sagot.

Facebook niya? Deactivated. Instagram? Wala na. Kahit lumang email niya, nagba-bounce.

Pinaka-kakaiba? Kilala ko ang gasolinahan. Kasama siya sa ruta ko papunta sa trabaho. Nadadaanan ko iyon tuwing mga 3 AM kapag may overnight maintenance ako. Hindi pa ako nakapasok doon, pero pamilyar ako.

Kaya binago ko ang iskedyul ko. Umiwas sa lugar na iyon.

Noong Marso 13, nanatili akong nasa bahay.


---

üì¨ Marso 14 ‚Äì Isa Pang Package

Kinabukasan, may nakita akong manila envelope sa may porch.

Walang selyo. Walang sulat.

Sa loob, may USB.

May file na ang pangalan ay:
REDACTED/AV001_LASTCONFIRMED.mp4

Pinanood ko.

Parehong gasolinahan. Parehong camera angle.

3:12 AM‚Äîpumasok ang isang lalaki na ibang hoodie ang suot. Parehong tindig. Parehong galaw.

Ako na naman.

Pero ngayon, imbes na pumunta sa counter, direkta akong lumapit sa camera, tumingin dito, at nagsalita:

> ‚ÄúAlam kong nanonood ka. Noon pa man.
Kailangan mo lang talagang makita bago ito mangyari.‚Äù



Ngumiti ako.

At yumuko. Dinampi ang kamay sa mismong lente.

Natapos ang footage.


---

üï≥Ô∏è Ngayon

Hindi na ako maayos nakatulog mula noon. Patuloy ang mga araw, pero sa bawat salamin, nakikita ko ang sarili ko‚Äînakatingin nang mas matagal kaysa dapat. Sa tuwing dumadaan ako sa bintana, parang may tao lang na umalis sa frame, hindi ko lang nahuli.

At kaninang umaga, yung lalaking nasa likod ng counter sa footage?

Siya na ang nagtatrabaho sa tunay na gasolinahan.

Nakita ko siya habang dumadaan ako sa trapiko. Tumitingin siya at ngumiti.

Hindi pa ako pumapasok doon.
Pero hindi na mahalaga.

Dahil nakita ko na.

At paparating na ito.

This is a really long post and I'm on mobile so sorry for the formatting. English isn't my first language (I'm from Ohio) but I'll try my best. (This is also my girlfriend‚Äôs throwaway account I found on her phone-she forgot to log out)

I'm (28M) dating 'Jane' (26F). We've been together for five years. Things are mostly great. We live in an apartment that my parents bought for me as an investment, so we don't pay rent, just utilities. Jane works as a kindergarten teacher and loves her job. I've been working as a data analyst at a place that does, like, insurance stuff? I wasn't super into it, but it paid well enough.

A few months ago, I was just completely over it. The commute was long, and my boss, 'Steve,' was really passive-aggressive about my time off requests. So, one Friday, I just... didn't go back on Monday. I didn't even tell them I was quitting. I just ghosted them. I figured it would be fine since I had some savings.

Jane was busy with work, so she didn't really notice for a few weeks. She'd get up, and I'd be up too, playing video games or watching TV. She'd just assume I was working from home, which I did sometimes. It was awesome. I spent my days just relaxing, trying out new hobbies like competitive online checkers and teaching myself to juggle. It was the most free I'd ever felt.

The issue came up last night at dinner. She said something about a concert we wanted to go to in a few months, and she was talking about how she'd put aside some money from her last paycheck for her ticket. I was eating my pasta and I just kinda shrugged and said, ""Yeah, that's fine, but you'll have to get my ticket too.""

She looked confused. ""What do you mean? You have a job.""

I said, ""Oh, about that... I quit a while ago. Like, two or three months ago, actually.""

And she just stared at me. Her face went completely blank. I thought it was funny, so I started to chuckle, but she didn't laugh with me. She just sat there, and then she stood up and walked into the bedroom without saying a word. I don't get what the big deal is. It's not like we're struggling. We don't have rent, and I'm not a big spender. She's the one who spends money on fancy coffee and avocado toast.

I tried to talk to her later, but she said she didn't want to. I'm starting to think I might have been a little inconsiderate, but I still don't think I'm the asshole here. I wasn't planning on being unemployed forever, I just wanted a break.

So, AITA?

1n14v70,https://www.reddit.com/r/Vent/comments/1n14v70/the_audacity/,The Audacity!,"The audacity of these people at my job. 

  
I work at a retirement home and work as a server who gets paid hourly. I work the Programs at my job, which means, since I am over 18, my shifts scheduled will be 7am-7pm (I usually get off at 6pm and we can take a 2 hour break, but I do not always take my two hour break). 

Since I have worked this job, people in the programs (there is Assistant Living and Enhanced Living). People consistently call off from work in AL for whatever reasons. I am the only one who is crossed trained in both departments, who do not call off from work or come into work.   
Each time I have to train someone in AL guess what happens? Someone who supposed to work EL so I can train in AL always ends up calling off when I have to train someone in AL. 

It is so irritating. I cannot run both programs.   
I cannot keep coming in on my off days when I have been working 6 days a week approximately 12 hour shifts, every single day for the past four months. 

Most of the time I work EL now and now everyone keeps calling off from work or coming into work late, it really screws me over, or the other person who is my reliver in EL over. All because when I work EL at 7am, I am supposed to do opening and do set up. So, I have to fill the juices, date them, fill the coffee crafts, fold silverware, change the menu's out (we get new menu's everyday that we have to change out) and then start serving people. If people keep calling in, and I have to go into the other department, then the people who are my reliver keeps getting messed over. 

Or more specifically I get messed over. Because I come in an hour early many days of the week, just in case someone calls off again and I get put behind, and then I am the one who have to deal with some of the vicious residents or vicious miserable CNA's. 

Or I am tired of sometimes the chief's coming into work late and how that affects me. 

That is all, that is my vent today.   
I work with some very inconsiderate people. I never in my life got this upset for people calling off from work, like ever. 

EDIT:

What I find the most hilarious is that recently one guy ask me to cover his shift. I worked a 7am-2pm and was excited to get off. Then this fool goes around and ask me can I cover his shift for $20 üòÇ üòÇ üòÇ üòÜ ü§£ ü§£ ü§£ wtf? Um nope bro. You pay me exactly what I will be earning to cover your shift, and then I will consider it. I will only come in on my off days if the other person pays me how much I am supposed to make for covering their shift, and if I am clocked in also earning those same wages. That's the only way idc üòë no more. You all need to learn to work your shifts when you are scheduled because Markie isn't doing it anymore unless I am making double the pay that day smh üòë

I was visiting a friend and she introduced me to some of her friends, in the group there was this guy (28M) who is totally my type.

I feel like I‚Äôve always been so scared of going out with guys who are my type because I feel like they are out of my league. And this is a resolve I have, to stop dating men who are just not my type because this isn‚Äôt emotional charity. But with this guy, we hit it off. He is a musician, so am I, he has impeccable taste in fashion, has tattoos, coffee lover, good looking, very kind and peaceful vibe. He is great.

I don‚Äôt want to overthink, we live in different states and it‚Äôs not like I am in love with him, but I am definitely interested. I just want to know if maybe he is just not interested in me and I should probably just let it fade away.

He sends me long texts, he seems very engaged. Should I just let it run its course? 

I am aware that maybe he is just not as online as me, I am very active on social media and I am a great texter even when I am super super busy. But I know not everyone is like that and I truly don‚Äôt want to seem intense.

This doesn't include the sales she has done on other platforms including her business website.

I taught her website flipping in my course, she went on to start flipping sites and now it's a full business.

* She flips starter sites and established sites
* She flips up to 10-15 sites a month
* Her niche is mostly lifestyle based

 This is one of many success stories I've had from students flipping sites. I recently celebrated the success of another student who flipped his first site as a beginner for $1,250.

# What is flipping websites about?

I build, grow and sell websites. I create sites from scratch around a topic I like:

* Parenting
* Business
* Gardening
* Coffee

Then I build a site and sell it, either as a starter microwebsite or an established website. My last starter site sold under $500, my last established website sold for $26,500.

# Is website flipping lucrative?

Yes! Even at a small scale, you can make 3 figures for each small site you sell and if you scale and do volume selling, it can be even more.

# Do you have to code?

No coding needed. No computer programming and yes, this is beginner friendly.

# How much can you make?

The sky is the limit!

$3K, $10K or more per month. Six figures per year. A fellow flipped I've worked with does about $250K/yr flipping sites. Another entrepreneur I follow on social media has made up to $400K website flipping.

I like it because it fits nicely with my introverted personality. I don't have to be on social media for this. No team needed. Flexible and lucrative.

I got the initial fillings at around 18 and 19 (didn‚Äôt go to the dentist all of high school‚Ä¶ don‚Äôt ask), replacement fillings at 23 for context.

Prior to the replacement, I was having constant, piercing pain and sensitivity in my teeth. I completely cut sugar out of my diet because it would leave me in such acute pain. I stopped drinking hot coffee. I had to put up with this pain for months because I didn‚Äôt have dental insurance. It was horrible, and I feel like it borderline traumatized me to have been in so much pain for so long. It took up so much mental space and absolutely drained me.

When I got the fillings replaced, my dentist noted that some of them are deeper than he expected they‚Äôd be. Unsure if that‚Äôs relevant.

These new fillings solved my pain! I started eating cookies and ice cream again! Yippee! Over the past two weeks though, I‚Äôve started to notice moments where that old pain has returned. As I‚Äôm typing this, I feel the pain in my teeth again, and I feel so anxious and horrible.

I brush my teeth every night, and if for some reason I didn‚Äôt, I brush in the morning as well. I carry a toothbrush and toothpaste in my purse because sometimes I‚Äôll see my teeth and they just don‚Äôt seem clean enough, so I‚Äôll brush them in the car. I have mouthwash I use every morning and when I get home from work to make sure I have good breath. I floss semi-regularly, but not all of the time and it could be better for sure. I use sensodyne toothpaste and I have prescription fluoride toothpaste. The toothpaste I keep in my purse is just a regular travel Colgate. I also use teeth whitening strips. I‚Äôm not the most disciplined person in life generally, but I‚Äôve really really tried with this.

Am I cooked? Am I just going to have pain forever, and this is just the reality of my teeth? It‚Äôs horrible and as stated earlier, I‚Äôm not disciplined. I like eating sugar and having treats, and it‚Äôs not like the pain doesn‚Äôt exist anyways even when I am cutting out all of this food. I often have the impulse to just want to rip my teeth out. 

Is there any hope? What do I even do? Am I expected to just be in pain forever now because that‚Äôs how my teeth reacted to fillings? I would‚Äôve rather just had the cavities at that point!

On top of this, he lives part-time with his mom (due to his work schedule) while the ex and the kids live there full-time. Occasionally, my boyfriend and the ex will be there the same nights.

My boyfriend and I also found out we are expecting our first child together. 

As for the issue at hand: I think his ex has unresolved issues with him. When I first met their kids, I wanted to be very respectful of her as their mother. She expressed discomfort with it, so I asked my boyfriend to offer a coffee ‚Äúdate‚Äù so we could meet. I respect that my boyfriend gets to choose who is around his kids, but I respect motherhood and really wanted to be accommodating to her as well. She declined by saying ‚ÄòI already see you (my boyfriend) enough. Her and I don‚Äôt need to be best friends.‚Äù I was hurt by this, but I moved past it. From there, every one of the kids‚Äô sporting events, every brief passing‚Ä¶ she ignored me. One instance at the kids‚Äô games, she deliberately spoke to everyone in the group but skipped me. She didn‚Äôt even look in my direction. Instead she told my boyfriend the funnnniiessstt story of how her friends joked with her about a video she reposted of my boyfriend hooting and hollering at the kids‚Äô game. In addition to this, she would also regularly wait for me to be out of earshot or in another room to enthusiastically tell my boyfriend about drama between people they both know. While my boyfriend has addressed that he doesn‚Äôt appreciate her exclusion of me (a conversation that she flipped and blamed on him and I), I feel that if she can‚Äôt be civil and let go of a marriage he doesn‚Äôt want to be in, conversations should be limited to the kids. Even when he doesn‚Äôt engage, she continues to interject with side conversations about things not relevant to the kids. 

As for my boyfriend, as I said above, he‚Äôs made some comments to her. It took a long time of me expressing my hurt. He largely tries to placate to keep things civil for the kids but has also acknowledged his struggle with setting boundaries with her, but also in general. 

While I am WHOLLY willing to accept if I‚Äôm the asshole for requesting some more firm boundaries, please be gentle. I don‚Äôt appreciate the narrative that this sets with the kids, as she made a snarky comment about the baby in front of one of them, or how disrespectful it feels that this all seems like unresolved emotional attachment I‚Äôm getting punished for. It feels like there has to be a resolution here that isn‚Äôt degrading for me but also protects the co-parenting relationship. I also want to acknowledge that conversations outside of the kids wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if the circumstances weren‚Äôt what they are. Offering coffee felt like a good foundation for being acquaintances or friends in a healthy way. I didn‚Äôt have a wholesome family, so I‚Äôm eager to build family where I can. Buttttt AITAH for asking my boyfriend to request that she only initiate conversations about the kids?",3,1756260420.0,AITAH,6,1.0,False

But after 1‚Äì2 years into work life‚Ä¶ suddenly excitement just vanishes. Meetings don‚Äôt count .  
Honestly, I don‚Äôt even remember my last real excitement‚Ä¶ maybe a random conversation with a stranger that made me smile.

I prefer no name jokes, because, y'know - I've heard them my whole life. I'm sure you're wondering why I've gathered you all today, and there's only one reason: I want friends. I look around at the end of the day, as I sit here in my bubble bath, and realize that I have a friend deficit. How do you even properly make friends as an adult? Clearly, the Internet is the answer.

*Who am I?*

‚Ä¢ A 31 year old glutton for punishment.
‚Ä¢ I went to school for Social Work, hoping that it would provide an avenue for my goal of helping more people than I ever hurt. 
‚Ä¢ I walk too fast and talk too slow.
‚Ä¢ I curse far too much and laugh too loud. (Maybe you know what it's like to be ""too much"" too?)
‚Ä¢ I have an unmistakable southern twang that happens to be growing on me.¬†
‚Ä¢ I bastardize every DIY project I attempt.
‚Ä¢ I've been called a lot of things, but quirky is the most common.

*What are my interests?*

‚Ä¢ Reading - I've started reviewing books and even started getting ARC reads from authors!
‚Ä¢ Gaming - I have an Xbox and I am currently addicted to Disney Dreamlight Valley while also loving Fortnite and Borderlands. I love silly games like Overcooked and Jackbox too!
‚Ä¢ Creativity¬†- whether it's making a cute book review card, coloring with my alcohol markers, painting from a YouTube tutorial, or junk journaling, I love anything that allows me some freedom to express myself!
‚Ä¢ Traveling - I enjoy cruises, a lot, but particularly love anything near the water or going somewhere that gives me an excuse to fly. I also love checking out new places for my urbex hobby!

*What are things I don't like?*

‚Ä¢ Coffee. (I know, a cardinal sin!)
‚Ä¢ People only interested in explicit exchange.
‚Ä¢ Toll roads.
‚Ä¢ Sushi.
‚Ä¢ Action movies. (I LOVE horror or thriller movies!)
‚Ä¢ One word or single emoji messages.

*What am I looking for?*

I don't want small talk. Text me, and without saying hello, tell me why you got so angry at your sister this morning. Tell me why you have a scar shaped like Europe on the left side of your neck. Send me paragraphs about the time you spent at your grandmother's house that one summer. Call me when I'm half asleep and tell me why you believe in God. Tell me about the first time you saw your dad cry. Go on for hours about things that may not seem important, because I promise that I'll be hanging on to every word you say. Tell me everything you want and nothing you don't.

Let's be honest, I doubt anyone here really wants to just greet each other and enter the endless cycle of ""what are you up to?"" and ""nothing, what are you up to?"" Let's talk about a song that describes you, the last time you lied, and what brought each of us here.

After all of my rambling, if you made it this far, you deserve a medal. You're my kind of people! What made you smile today?¬†",0,1756260350.0,Needafriend,1,0.5,False

I drink coffee morning, afternoon, and even at night. If I don‚Äôt have coffee first thing in the morning, I literally can‚Äôt get myself to do anything.

I'm on medication, but coffee feels like both a stimulant and a calmer for me. When I‚Äôm really restless or my brain feels ‚Äústuck,‚Äù I‚Äôll crave coffee even more. Sometimes I even drink it right before bed, not because I want to stay awake, but because my brain feels so uncomfortable that I need coffee to clear it up before I can fall asleep. It doesn‚Äôt keep me from sleeping, but my sleep quality is pretty bad, and I‚Äôm not sure how much of that is caffeine-related.

I'm usually quite okay with everything containing lingon berry to be called swedish, even though the average person over there mainly use the jam for meatballs and nothing else. But today I saw the ""Swedish egg coffee"" and I had to do a double-take. Came home and sent that to all my friends over in Sweden... Nobody knew of it, a caf√© blog in Sweden was making fun of it as well. So I took a look online and it seem to come from Chicago, made up by a religious person who escaped Sweden during the famine.

So I have to ask what other people think of these ""swedish goods"" around town.

I'll also include some exciting choices from Wednesday and Thursday (if any are on). Also, I started my first subreddit strictly for Ipswich events: https://www.reddit.com/r/ThingsToDoIpswichQLD/. Please sub and let's talk upcoming events. As mentioned last week I do this events listing already for my Ipswich free weekly newsletter (https://ipswichinsider.com.au/) so posting a curated version here every Wednesday arvo is no dramas.

Feedback in the comments is appreciated.

I really just need some help, so hopefully someone here can help me?)

**Long Post Warning.**

**TRIGGER WARNING: FOOD, FASTING, WEIGHT LOSS, BED DISCUSSED IN DETAIL, ETC.**

**I'm not encouraging any of what I did, I'm just explain what I did to get here, and why I feel so desperate. I really just need help.**

For reference I‚Äôm 29, I‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 I have loads of trauma that I was able to work through (not fully healed but I‚Äôve come a long way, I have ADHD, Mild Anxiety, and I have ‚Äúhigh functioning‚Äù depression.¬†

I used to be able to manage my binge eating with intermittent fasting. It wasn‚Äôt perfect and I have a tendency to binge at night time but it worked. I was able to loose weight - I was probably eating around 1300 and it worked.¬†

Until it didn‚Äôt.

After the event that I lost the weight for was over, I think my nervous system stopped trying so hard (I didn‚Äôt realize it at the time, until I had gained all the weight back and it was too late.

Then I tried weightlifting which I loved! I was good at it (not perfect - but I had fun) I build muscle easy (former dancer) and I noticed the difference. The issue?

Lifting causes me to binge, I don‚Äôt know why. So, I stopped.¬†

I gained like 20-30 pounds in a year, and I didn‚Äôt notice how bad it was until it was too late.¬†

I have a habit of not being honest when I track my food because I feel guilty. The past couple days I have been tracking my food and even if I don‚Äôt eat breakfast I‚Äôm still eating around 2500-2700 calories. I balance between 186-190, but I‚Äôm scared the scale has gone up - I haven‚Äôt looked.¬†

I usually weigh myself everyday and I know people say it‚Äôs bad but I can be so out of sight/out of mind. Weighing myself everyday gives me a sense of control. Because when I stop I know it‚Äôs out of fear of what the scale may say.

This past year I tried the compounded medicine, and it helped kinda, but the issue is in order to get proper effects I would have needed to go up in dosage and I couldn‚Äôt afford it. Then compounded was no longer available.¬†

Then I started taking medicine for BED (Binge Eating Disorder) and it helped my ADHD as well - but I got assigned a useless doctor, it was messing with my blood sugar (I think) and there were some days I had trouble walking, That‚Äôs around the time when I stopped lifting (I started and stopped through the lifting process because int causes me to binge).

But now im struggling because I‚Äôm off Vyvanse and feel helpless.¬†

I‚Äôve tried coffee

I‚Äôve tried Yerba (which helps but not fully)

I‚Äôve tried appetite suppressant lollipops (which help but they cause me to break out)

Vyvanse caused too many issues that were unidentifiable¬†

Compounded is no longer accessible to me¬†

Intermittent Fasting doesn‚Äôt help like it used too (I had to change my eating habits when I was on Vyvanse, I ate often but I was losing weight. But now Im off of it and it‚Äôs so hard for me to revert my eating habits back to before. I‚Äôm doing the same but because I don‚Äôt have Vyvanse help, instead of losing weight - I‚Äôm gaining.¬†

And if I even try something like OMAD my nervous system freaks out and causes me to binge everything.

I‚Äôve considered lifting again to balance how much I‚Äôm eating but I‚Äôm scared it‚Äôll make my bingeing worse.

I‚Äôve even tried ‚Äònatures Oz‚Äô berberine, and it made me GAIN weight.¬†

I hate the way I look, my body, and I‚Äôm getting fat, and I fear I cannot stop it. Professional help is not an option right now, nor is medicine, I can‚Äôt afford it.¬†

I wish I could go back on Vyvanse (with proper help assuming we can figure out the issue because not only did it help my BED, it helped my ADHD.)

(Also I have a ton of allergies which always end up being a problem, corn, soy, dark meats/turkey, eggs, dairy, beans, peas, and more,)

I‚Äôm desperate and I don‚Äôt know what to do, I don‚Äôt have any healthy people in my life, and I don‚Äôt want to live in this body anymore.¬†

Can anyone help me?

Don't worry - Bevo has your back! Since we are all mutual friends of Bevo's:

**This FRIDAY Aug 29 at 6:00pm is the annual Bevo's Friends Meetup by the Tower.** 

**ALL new Longhorns who want to meet people should gather this Friday on the South Mall** *(grassy area between the Littlefield Fountain and the Tower)***.** Come a little before 6pm so you are ready at 6. 

**At 6pm when the bell tolls**, say hello and introduce yourself to 20 people near you (or as many as you are comfortable meeting). When EVERYONE is in ""meet people and make new friends"" mode, it is MUCH easier! Then you can exchange details/follow each other's socials. Or just enjoy the social interaction. 

**NEW OPTION THIS YEAR:** To make things easier for those that have trouble striking up conversations with strangers,   
you can **bring a sign** (just a simple piece of paper to hold up) with the name of an activity you hope to do with friends at UT. Write BIG so people can see it. (Legal and NON-SEXUAL *ONLY*!! In case that needs to be said.)   
**When the bell chimes 6:00** hold up your signs and look around for people that want to do anything you also want to do. You will already have a topic to talk about!  (Or just randomly talk to people if you prefer.) 

**The rules are simple:** Actively look for people with interests you already share or with new interests that make you curious.    If possible try not to just stand there hoping people approach you!     Be polite and say hello to everyone you meet.     And no making fun of anyone's interests!  

**It goes QUICKLY!** At 6:30, head off with your new friends to do your shared activity. Or make plans to do it. Or go grab a coffee somewhere and talk about it. Or take a tour around campus. Or you can go home and check out the socials of your potential future friends. That's really all there is to it. So have fun!   

In case you need a prompt, here are some suggestions for the kinds of things you might put on the sign for your interests:

*^(Watch (name of sport) games,      fantasy football,      Dungeons and Dragons,      shopping,      trying new restaurants,      book club,       robotics,       play (name of video game),       mini golf,       get coffee,       work out,       hike,        sneakerhead,       thrifting,          cosmetics/hairstyling/nails,      watch (name of tv show of film franchise),       museums,       theatre,       concerts,       jam (type of music),       cook/bake,       birdwatch,       biking,        stand-up comedy,       hunting,      building computers,      magic,      poker,      yoga,     clubbing,     having (type of pet),       fanfiction,       Kpop,      foreign lanuages,       rigorous intellectual debate,      recreational sports (that aren't in the club leagues), or...)*.    

You get the idea!

Also don't forget to join clubs/orgs etc. Hang out in common areas. Go to games (not just football). Making friends takes a little effort! 

We are all friends with Bevo, so he hopes we all get to know each other too. Good luck!ü§ò

\-----

With children and friends, I left Sweden on a cool spring day for a trip to a paradise island in the Atlantic Ocean. The island has the name Eleuthera - pronounced Elootra - and is one of the many Bahamas islands. The trip starts from Stockholm via London, Bermudas and Nassau where we spend the night. The following day we fly in a helicopter on the last stretch to the airport Rock Sound in Eleuthera.  
At three o'clock in the afternoon we landed. We step out in the wonderful warm air and walk through a modest air terminal and collect our luggage. There he is. It's King Bee. A negro, almost two meters tall, dressed in a bright green, fluorescent suit with a tie in the same material that reaches almost all the way down to his knees. He immediately takes charge of us and our bags and takes us to his big Cadillac, which has seen better days. The front of the car is decorated with colourfull pennants. On the front doors he painted his own name ""King Bee"" in graceful letters and the picture of a bee to make it complete.  
King Bee was going to give us many fun moments during our stay in Eleuthera. With his positive view on life and his big, infectious laugh he gave us the best welcome we could have wished for.  
The road to Cape Eleuthera Resort, where we will be staying, is full of potholes, which King Bee does all he can to avoid. They are the result of all the heavy winter rains and floodings. The Queen's Highway is the only asphalted road on the island, and it goes from the north to the south all across the island. We drive through small villages with pastel-coloured houses, in which large families live. Outside of every house clothes are hanging to dry, and chickens and goats are walking around the gardens. On every roof is a huge TV-antenna and outside the houses big American cars are parked. Next to the occupied houses there are concrete foundations which are overgrown with weeds. We are informed that by building a foundation you are getting the right to a bigger property.  
Once we arrive in Powell Point and at our hotel we check in and get all the information we need and the keys to our bungalows. At that time, we are all quite tired after the trip. The time difference to Sweden is six hours and our bodies haven't adjusted yet. We unpack our bags and decide to have a late lunch. Everyone is happy to finally have arrived. The children immediately run off to have the first swim in the pool. We walk through the area that has bungalows that all look the same. We continued our walk down to the marina and get to see cool motorboats equipped for deepwater fishing. We have lunch at the Marina‚Äôs club house. It's a beautiful lunch, fresh fish and Tropical Adventure, a dish filled with delicious fruit. We aren't up to doing very much more this day so we all go to bed early.  
The following day we get up and have an early breakfast. You mustn't be in a hurry, because the staff serving us aren't. Everyone has their own pace. And it's just for us stressed Nordic people to accept it otherwise you might suffer a nervous breakdown. The initial irritation disappears as the beautiful breakfast is being served. Domestic fresh pineapples, melons, egg dishes, freshly baked bread, fruit juices, great coffee and tea.  
We enjoy changing into our bathing suits and walking down to the beach for our first swim. The sand is warm under your feet, and the sea is turquoise blue with darker patches where the coral reeves are. It takes a bit of courage to get into the water, which is cool, but the sense of pleasure soon arrives, and after a twenty minute swim you feel new and strong. The knowledge that we have almost fourteen days left in this beautiful environment makes us nice and happy. My passion is to go waterskiing and some of the others love to go windsurfing. Unfortunately, there is no equipment to be rented on the island, which makes us a little disappointed. However, there is a large golf course on the island. Most of it is located close to the water so there are many golf balls that are lost. The players don't walk on the course as we do in Sweden, instead they have a little golf cart. It's a fun little thing and it looks like the radio cars at Gr√∂na Lund, but with a sunroof. The cart is so easy to drive, even the kids can do it without any problem. That becomes their big fun and toy during our stay.  
Warm and lazy days come and go. We are swimming, sunbathing and taking long walks along the beach. We find large, beautiful shells called Conch. It is used in cooking and a real delicacy.  
When the sun gets too hot, we rest in the shadow of the palm trees in big, comfortable hammocks. We listen to music and read books or lose ourselves in our thoughts and look out on the endless horizon.  
One day we want to discover another beach. We decided to go to Cotton Bay, a few miles north. King Bee drives us in his car and entertains us with song and talk. He has a voice that drowns everything else and it's more rare than beautiful. He teaches us the Eleuthera song, a happy reggae tune which makes fun of most things on the island.  
Cotton Bay is a very beautiful beach. It is several kilometers long with sand that feels like velvet under your feet. Here is also a golf course located with a beautiful location and a pink hotel with a patio completely covered in hibiscus flowers in beautiful colors.  
The day has a bad ending. Love happens to step on a sea urchin and lots of its nasty spines are caught in his foot. It's impossible for us to remove them, and with the risk of an infection we must go to the hospital in Rock Sound. It's a beautiful villa and Filipino doctor treats Love with antibiotics and a tetanus shot. The spines are impossible to remove, but they will dissolve eventually. There's a happy ending to this drama, and Love is happy now that this ""death threat"" is gone.  
April 16 is a very special day. It is the day when Barbro and Love are going to get engaged, and what could be more romantic than doing that on a deserted island. We rent a fishing boat with a crew, and we bring picnic baskets and champagne bottles onboard. We travel for an hour to a very small island with a long sand reef, stretching out into the sea for a couple of kilometers. We leave the boat and have to walk a few meters to get to land. The sky looked threatening during the boat trip and now it's like it has completely opened up and the rain is pouring down. It's a strange feeling standing there on that deserted island in the pouring rain. We try to protect ourselves with our towels, but to no avail. We are immediately soaked so we jump into the water and swim in the mild rain. That's a very sensual feeling. The weather changes are extremely quick and soon the sun is shining again. Lunch is served with several kinds of sandwiches, fresh fruit and champagne. But first the rings must be exchanged! The crew looks amused as we cheer and sing for the newly engaged couple. We take out the present we have smuggled along, we bought it a couple of days earlier in Rock Sound. It's the ugliest miniature lazy chair you can imagine. It has fleece on it and a small lid on the seat and we suggest that the couple can keep their rings there. Champagne corks are popping. We toast each other and the engagement is a fact. It's a beautiful day.  
On the way back some of us try to catch a fish. The only one who has any success is Fredrik. He had to work hard to get his catch onboard. It's a fish called Grouper. The tail of the fish is lacerated, we think it's a shark. It looks nasty, so we throw it back into the ocean.  
In the afternoon, the girls get together around the pool. A cool drink and some girls talk with great friends is pure bliss. The kids are having a great time. Hel√®ne has decided to lose a couple of kilos and is doing that by swimming energetically and only eating fruit and vegetables. The kids have their schoolbooks with them and a couple of hours each days are spent doing homework; math, French and English. King Bee keeps us company every now and then and is making attempts to learn Swedish. ""Jag √§lskar dig"" becomes ""ja√§rskarii"", and ""har det varit n√•tt"" becomes ""hare oatt n√•tt"". Everyone is having fun with his way of pronouncing the words and he is having a lot of fun himself. He doesn't waste any time to show off his new knowledge to his co-workers, and he is beaming with joy over knowing something they don't.  
The existence in paradise unfortunately must come to an end. The day of the departure arrives, and we enjoy one last lovely breakfast. We had a calm and nice time together. It seems like we picked the right time, because today a heat wave has started and it's almost unbearingly hot. With the heatwave a lot of American tourists arrive, and the calm is changing into a lot of noise. It feels somewhat like a relief to leave Eleuthera this particular day.  
King Bee is the singsong-leader during our trip to the airport. We sing the Eleuthera song, this happy, rhythmic song, over and over again and with it ringing in our ears we say goodbye to King Bee and Eleuthera."" (Written by Anni-Frid Lyngstad)",1,1756258798.0,ABBA,1,0.67,False

Round trip ferry service across the lake is $40, otherwise you can hike the 4 miles around the lake to get to the parking lot. Parking is free and I didn‚Äôt have any concerns about leaving my car there for a few days as it‚Äôs a single lane road in and out. Kaiser pass was slow going due to pot holes and construction vehicles.        

We took the 3:30pm ferry across and hiked past John Muir Ranch to camp for the first night. The first 2 miles of the hike had very steep terrain and the elevation gain was kicking my butt.         

Day 2 started off with a relaxing morning wading in the river and drinking coffee. We packed up and hiked 8 miles up to Evolution Valley with the last 2 miles containing the most significant elevation gain. We managed to find camp near the river and spent Day 3 and part of Day 4 swimming and exploring.        

Day 4 we packed up and hiked back down to our original campsite. We were able to take our time and really took in the views. Every switchback led to an incredible view that made me incredibly grateful to exist on our planet. We managed to make quick work of the 8 miles back and enjoyed more river time at camp.          

Day 5 neither of us slept well for some reason, which gave us an opportunity to see the Milky Way. We decided to get up and start our hike at 7 to catch the 10am ferry back to the parking lot instead of our original plan to catch the 1pm since we had a 6+ hour drive home. The sunlight pouring across the meadows painted everything in hues of yellows and golds.

1n145r1,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1n145r1/dominion_hunters/,Dominion Hunters,"The void glittered with impossible density.

Commander Rhel‚Äôith pressed the secondary ocular membrane tighter to sharpen focus. His crew had projected a traffic schematic over the forward display, and it looked‚Äîabsurd.

‚ÄúThousands,‚Äù his navigation officer murmured, frills flattening in disbelief. ‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ tens of thousands. They crawl across every orbital lane.‚Äù

Rhel‚Äôith‚Äôs mandibles clicked in irritation. The data was correct, but it made no sense. When the deep space scouts had returned saying they had found an unknown space faring race they had intentionally picked an outlying system for their first incursion. They had expected to find a single colony-world, perhaps two, guarded by a small mix of patrol cutters. Instead, they‚Äôd stumbled upon a system webbed with slow-moving vessels: bulky hulls, ponderous drives, little more than fragile eggshells drifting between planets. Even more preposterous there was thousands more of even more massive vessels, that seemed to be accelerating and decelerating on intersystem courses.

But as perplexing as that was, it was not what he really cared about, there was not a warship among them, or at least nothing that the scouts passive sensors even classified as a Minor Militarized vessel.

‚ÄúIdentify their engines,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith ordered.

‚ÄúReaction drives, chemical variants‚Ä¶ some of the larger vessels carry fusion drives,‚Äù the officer replied. ‚ÄúPrimitive. Sublight only. None carry foldspace initiators.‚Äù

Rhel‚Äôith leaned back in his command cradle, disbelief giving way to a slow, predatory amusement. An empire that could spread across at least 2 dozen systems just from the estimated course plots of the intersystem vessels, yet fielded only ships that crawled like larvae through realspace? It was laughable. These ‚Äòhumans‚Äô must have spent centuries hurling fragile caravans into the dark, waiting decades for their own commerce to arrive.

Pathetic.

‚ÄúDo they not understand the foldstream?‚Äù one of his aides asked, incredulous.

‚ÄúClearly not,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith said. His frills rippled in a gesture of contempt. ‚ÄúThey are children. Industrious, yes‚Äîbut toothless. Look at them. So many vessels, yet each one a target that cannot even flee.‚Äù

The bridge hummed with quiet derision as the officers studied the projection. Countless human ships inching across the void, specks of dust clinging to gravity wells, pushing along their freight with all the urgency of insects dragging crumbs back to a nest.

‚ÄúThey swarm,‚Äù another officer sneered. ‚ÄúBut a swarm of larvae is still larvae.‚Äù

Rhel‚Äôith let the silence stretch, savoring the sight of such naivety. A civilization this vast, yet it had built its foundations on weakness. No fleets to guard their arteries. No predators to cull their herds. He could only thing of one possible reasoning behind it.

‚ÄúThey lack predators,‚Äù he said at last, his voice carrying across the command deck. ‚ÄúThey have never been tested. Their strength is illusion‚Äîa great mass of vessels without fangs. Gatherers, not hunters.‚Äù

Around him, his bridge crew shifted with eagerness, their frills and mandibles flexing in anticipation. Here was prey masquerading as peers. Prey that could be seized, dissected, and bent to the Dominion‚Äôs will.

‚ÄúPrepare the fleet,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith commanded, voice edged with triumph. ‚ÄúThis system will serve as our demonstration. When the rest of their kind see how quickly their nest burns, they will understand what it means to meet a true people.‚Äù

A chorus of assent rippled across the bridge. The humans did not yet know they had been found. And already, Rhel‚Äôith thought, they were lost.

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Dominion fleet slipped into the shadow of the system‚Äôs outer ice belt, foldspace drives cooling to silence. Here, hidden among shattered moons and drifting debris, Commander Rhel‚Äôith convened his war council.

The tactical display bloomed with symbols: clusters of human ships, fat with cargo, crawling like ungainly beetles between planets and stations. Their lanes of travel glowed bright with wasteful inefficiency, each convoy plodding through predictable arcs.

‚ÄúLook how they cling to gravity wells,‚Äù sneered Sub-Commander Veyrik, his frills pulsing with contempt. ‚ÄúNo dispersal, no decoys, no escorts. They advertise themselves like prey animals in rut.‚Äù

A ripple of mocking amusement spread across the chamber.

Rhel‚Äôith tilted his head, mandibles flexing in satisfaction. ‚ÄúThey have grown complacent. A people that does not fear predation forgets how to hide. These ‚Äòhumans‚Äô display every weakness: swollen numbers, soft shells, no teeth.‚Äù

The war-planners brought up interception models. The probabilities made his pulse quicken: a single Dominion cruiser, properly positioned, could carve through entire convoys before the humans had time to scatter. A task group could annihilate their orbital docks in a matter of hours.

‚ÄúSuggest we strike here first,‚Äù Veyrik offered, gesturing to a broad stream of cargo haulers threading between the systems two inhabited worlds. ‚ÄúBreak their artery. Watch their nest starve.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith countered, his tone sharp. ‚ÄúWe will not waste this discovery on mere harassment. This is not a pest to be culled. It is a resource to be seized.‚Äù He raised his claws toward the central planet glowing on the display, its orbit encircled with hundreds of sublight freighters and habitats. ‚ÄúWe will strike at the heart. We will show them the Dominion does not gnaw at scraps. We devour.‚Äù

A murmur of assent rolled through the chamber. Officers tapped claws in approval.

Rhel‚Äôith‚Äôs inner frills flared with satisfaction as he delivered the final order:

‚ÄúPrepare the fleets for descent. Signal the auxiliaries to ready the harvest engines. When the first human nest falls, the rest will crumble in terror. They cannot fight what they cannot flee. They are already ours.‚Äù

The chamber resonated with a single word, spoken as oath and prophecy:

‚ÄúOurs.‚Äù

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Captain Elara Vance had just finished her third mug of bitter synth-coffee when the first alarms rippled across the *Ceres Dawn‚Äôs* bridge.

At first, she thought it was a sensor fault. Their route was simple one, taking cargo out to the transfer stations, but it was a busy day. There was nearly thirty ships within 10 light seconds, all of them fat-bellied freighters packed with ore and other goods, crawling along the standard lane between Ceres Prime and the outer habitats. No pirates operated this deep in the Empire. No accidents had been reported. And yet‚Äî

‚ÄúCaptain,‚Äù her sensor officer called out, voice tight, ‚Äúnew contacts. Multiple. High energy signatures, vectoring in from the outer belt.‚Äù

Elara leaned forward in her chair. The display filled with cold, alien shapes sliding into realspace like knives pulled from sheaths. Their hulls were unlike anything she recognized‚Äîsleek, predatory, glowing with drive signatures her databases didn‚Äôt even classify.

And they were fast. Too fast.

‚ÄúConvoy control, this is *Ceres Dawn*,‚Äù she snapped into the comm. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve got unknowns on approach, closing at military velocities. Recommend immediate evasive dispersal.‚Äù

Static. Then panicked chatter burst across the convoy channel‚Äîhalf a dozen captains talking at once, voices high with disbelief.

‚ÄúUnknown vessels‚Äî‚Äù  
‚ÄúNot in registry‚Äî‚Äù  
‚ÄúThey‚Äôre weapons hot‚Äî‚Äù

The first strike fell like a god‚Äôs hammer.

A beam of searing light cut through the freighter *Maribel‚Äôs Hope*, shearing the ship in half. The transmission cut to silence as two glowing husks drifted apart, venting fire and frozen bodies into the void. A second shot crippled the *Horizon Belle*, rupturing her drives and sending her tumbling.

The convoy scattered, freighters burning their sluggish engines, trying to flee. But freighters weren‚Äôt built for flight. Their acceleration was a fraction of the attackers‚Äô.

‚ÄúEvasive pattern Delta-Seven. Full thrust!‚Äù Elara barked.

The *Ceres Dawn* lurched as her fusion drives thundered to maximum. The deck groaned under acceleration it was never meant to sustain.

Then came the killing blow.

Something slammed into the aft section‚Äîan energy lance or a missile; she couldn‚Äôt tell. The bridge lights flickered, alarms shrieked, and the ship pitched violently as her main engines went dark.

‚ÄúEngines offline!‚Äù her chief engineer shouted over the klaxons. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost the drive, we‚Äôre dead in the void!‚Äù

Elara‚Äôs stomach turned to ice. Around her, terrified eyes turned to her for answers she didn‚Äôt have. The *Ceres Dawn* drifted, helpless, while predatory shadows closed in on her ship.

She opened her mouth to order abandon ship‚Äî

‚Äîand then the comms officer screamed.

‚ÄúCaptain! They‚Äôre‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre locking onto us! Grapples incoming!‚Äù

The last thing Elara saw before the deck went red with emergency strobes was the image on the tactical screen: alien vessels angling in, not to destroy them, but to *board*.

¬†\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

¬†

The boarding tunnel sealed against the human vessel‚Äôs hull with a hollow clang, metal biting metal. Within seconds, the lock was breached. The cutter arms withdrew, and the iris opened.

Rhel‚Äôith‚Äôs warriors surged through first, shock pikes held ready. They expected resistance‚Äîthrashing, screaming, futile weapons fire. That was the way of lesser species when confronted with their betters.

Instead, they found silence.

The corridor beyond was dim, bathed in pulsing crimson from emergency strobes. Atmosphere still held. Panels sparked weakly from the hull strike. And in the center of it all stood the humans.

A dozen of them, unarmored, huddled together in the narrow passage. Some wore the simple coveralls of workers, others the patched uniforms of officers. Their hands were raised in the universal gesture of surrender. Their faces were pale, eyes wide with fear. One clutched a child close to her chest.

The boarding squad slowed, weapons crackling with restrained energy. Then came the laughter‚Äîan ugly clicking sound, mandibles clattering in derision.

‚ÄúThey beg already,‚Äù one warrior sneered. ‚ÄúThey have not even tested our blades.‚Äù

The human captain stepped forward, shaking but resolute. Her voice wavered as she spoke in their crude tongue, broadcast through the emergency channel.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶ we surrender. We are civilians. There is no need for violence.‚Äù

The translator carried her words into the aliens‚Äô helmets. Rhel‚Äôith, listening from his command cradle aboard the cruiser, felt a wave of amusement ripple through his frills.

Civilians. As though that excused their existence. As though the weak had any right to plead before the strong.

‚ÄúPathetic,‚Äù Veyrik muttered beside him. ‚ÄúLook at them. They yield without a fight. They are not a people‚Äîthey are livestock.‚Äù

On the human vessel, the boarding leader thrust his shock pike forward. The humans flinched as one, drawing tighter together. He did not strike‚Äîmerely prodded the air in contempt, like a rancher herding docile beasts.

‚ÄúBind them,‚Äù the leader ordered. ‚ÄúThe commander will want live specimens.‚Äù

Chains were produced, wrists bound, collars locked around necks. The humans submitted without resistance, trembling and silent.

Rhel‚Äôith leaned back in his cradle, utterly satisfied. The humands holdings seemed vast, yes‚Äîbut hollow. If this was the face of their frontier, the heart must be softer still.

He allowed himself a small, predatory smile. ‚ÄúSend word to the fleet. The harvest is as simple as expected. We will take their worlds in days, not months.‚Äù

On the screen, the captured humans were dragged away, their eyes filled not with defiance, but with terror. Not one raised a weapon. Not one made them bleed.

To the Dominion, it was proof beyond doubt: humanity was prey.

\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From his command dais aboard the battlecruiser *Scourge of Suns*, Commander Rhel‚Äôith surveyed the spectacle unfolding before him. The planet below glittered with night-side lights, sprawling cities strung across continents like rivers of fire. Above it hung the lattice of orbital infrastructure‚Äîrings of stations, shipyards, and habitation towers, tethered to the planet by steady streams of freighters.

There were thousands of vessels here, moving with ponderous precision, none of them armed. The entire orbital network pulsed with activity: cargo transfers, refinery outputs, transport hubs. An industrious hive.

And not a single warship in sight.

‚ÄúDisplay their defenses,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith ordered.

The tactical officer complied, overlaying the orbital sphere with target markers. Power stations, logistics depots, relay satellites‚Äîall exposed. Weapons platforms were scattered and weak, designed for orbital traffic control, not to repel an armada.

Veyrik let out a mocking laugh. ‚ÄúThis is their heart? A swollen mass of feeders and nests. They have built monuments to their own complacency.‚Äù

The fleet spread into formation, cruisers and destroyers peeling away into hunting packs. Boarding craft swarmed like insects around the leading vessels, eager to be loosed.

‚ÄúDo not waste time with their outliers,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith commanded. His frills flexed in satisfaction. ‚ÄúStrike the shipyards. Break their orbital docks, and the nest below will suffocate. Once their eggshells shatter, their own civilians will choke on the debris.‚Äù

The first volley came without resistance.

Lances of coherent light tore through the void, striking stations with surgical precision. A refinery platform erupted, venting liquid fire into orbit. Habitation towers cracked and broke, spinning down into the atmosphere like burning spears. Cargo tethers snapped, and entire freighters were dragged helplessly into the planet‚Äôs gravity well, vanishing in arcs of flame.

On the surface, alarm beacons lit across continents. But the Dominion officers only saw prey scurrying, powerless to intervene.

‚ÄúThey scatter,‚Äù one lieutenant reported, his voice heavy with contempt. ‚ÄúNot even token defense craft. Only transports, running.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith replied. ‚ÄúLet them run. The more they flee, the clearer their nature becomes. These are not hunters. They are herd.‚Äù

Another volley fell, and with it another ring of stations broke apart, adding their wreckage to the growing storm of debris circling the colony world.

To Rhel‚Äôith, the message was already clear. If this thriving colony‚Äîso far from its heart‚Äîwas undefended, then the rest of humanity must be even softer than he imagined.

‚ÄúMark it well,‚Äù Rhel‚Äôith declared to his officers. ‚ÄúThis is not their nest‚Äôs core. Merely an outlying brood. Yet see how fat it has grown, without claws to guard it. Imagine how easily their true home will fall.‚Äù

Though as he watched, he suddenly started to feel uneasy.

Something was happening.

The void between his ship and the planet rippled with energy‚Äîan unnatural disturbance, wrong in a way that made his frills tighten in instinctive dread. His fleet‚Äôs energy lances flickered as they fired again, beams bending, breaking, or vanishing into the turbulence that now writhed in front of them.

‚ÄúCommander‚Äîour shots are dissipating!‚Äù one of his officers cried.

Rhel‚Äôith leaned forward, mandibles clenching. The disturbance widened into a great, seething wound in space itself, arcs of white-blue lightning clawing at the darkness.

This was no shield, no weapon. This was a *tear*.  
A tear in the very fabric of reality.

It invoked primal fear, cracking his steadfast resolve in a way he could never have imagined possible.

Then, as he sat watching in disbelieving horror, he realized he could see shapes starting to coalesce.

Enormous shapes. Shapes that were monstrous even on a cosmic scale.

The first vessel emerged with terrifying slowness, kilometers of armored hull sliding out of the rift like some leviathan from an abyss. Its surface was dark and bristling with weapon mounts, its silhouette blocky and functional‚Äînot sleek like Dominion warships, but colossal, every line screaming endurance and power.

Its emergence dragged the rift wider, and more followed behind: another, and another, each one a moving fortress. The starfield disappeared behind their hulls, entire constellations swallowed by their size. The disturbance thundered with the energy of their passage, like the bellowing of gods roused from slumber.

The humans had come.

Not in convoys. Not in prey-ships. But in leviathans, each appearing large enough to devour a Dominion battlegroup whole. Yet he was looking at 9 of them.

The prey had teeth.

On the bridge of the *Scourge of Suns*, the silence was absolute. The jeering mockery, the smug confidence, the victorious anticipation‚Äîit had all drained away, leaving only the raw stench of fear.

One officer finally broke the silence, voice thin and brittle: ‚ÄúCommander‚Ä¶ what *are* those?‚Äù

Rhel‚Äôith had no answer. His mandibles twitched soundlessly as he stared at the colossal human warships sliding into their kill-zone as though the Dominion fleet did not even matter.

For the first time, he realized he might not be the hunter, but the prey.",15,1756258639.0,HFY,4,1.0,False

Simple recipe, horribly formatted though cuz im drunk and lazy.","Not sure what flair to apply so i used the recipe flair if thats ok. I boiled a tablespoon of bakers yeast, quarter tablespoon tomato paste, one earl gray teabag, one peach chopped into uneven cubes, half a vitamin b complex packet, and a pinch of creatine in a cup of water. I added about 3 cups of sugar while it was warm and then I strained it and added it to a bottle with 3.5 liters water and a packet of fleischmanns. If the cup of liquid nutrient doesnt melt all the sugar just add some of your water. I left it in my closet with the cap loose and an old shirt on top of it for 2 weeks. When done i poured half a glass and i can feel the burning of the alcohol as it goes down my throat. Kind of makes me nauseous when undiluted, almost vomited, but its fine. 

2 days ago, i mixed 8 cups of water with dry mint, mint water, 3 green tea bags, 8 heaping tablespoons dry hibiscus, cloves, lemon juice, and sumac and put it in the fridge. Ive been sipping on that with honey while waiting for the hooch and its delicious. I know, i kinda just mixed shit together like the ""potions"" i made when i was 8, but whatever. 

Today, when the hooch was ready, i drank half a glass of hooch and it made me feel nauseous but it didnt taste bad. i decided to pour half a glass of the hibiscus liquid and another half glass of the hooch into a coffee filter and waited for it to filter. I poured it into a cup and added like an inch layer of honey to the bottom. Mix mix mix, and boom, ready to drink. 

Im currently sipping on it, and its fucking fantastic. No nausea, less burn, and a sweet taste. Diluting it makes it more hydrating which means less of a hangover, especially since im a beginner and probably created a bunch of other alcohols while fermenting that are more harmful than ethanol. I just cant get over how easy this was and how tasty it is. I was worried at the start, like what if i fuck it up, what if i have to discard of it because it tastes bad, what if i get sick because i didnt sanitize it, what if it doesnt get me drunk, but wow.. Most of my worries, gone. I didnt even cold crash it. Just poured it straight from the vessel. 

Still worried a little bit about botulism, but its not like i used potatoes or any material that grows close to the ground right? in foodsafe they taught us botulism only makes toxins when escaping the outer coating it creates when its in danger, and that can only happen in anaerobic conditions after heating then cooling. Does botulism also make toxins when multiplying or consuming sugars? No idea. 

Sorry if im rambling, im on stimulants and drunk rn. But i really recommend this to any fellow beginners. You will be pleasantly surprised and its easier than you think. People really like to complicate it, but i mean, random kids make this with sugar, water, and bakers yeast without a recipe, and prisoners make this with fruit, water, and honeybuns.

Your online reputation is like your shadow‚Äîit‚Äôs always there, shaping how people see you. Ignore it, and it can mess up your personal and professional life big time. I‚Äôve seen it happen too often, so I‚Äôm here to share some real examples of what goes wrong and easy tips to stay ahead. Trust me, being proactive beats cleaning up a mess later.

Let‚Äôs start with your personal life, like dating. 

A 2023 study says 55% of folks Google potential dates, and 44% have ghosted after finding dirt. Women dig deep‚Äî51% do thorough checks vs. 25% of men. About 30% won‚Äôt meet if your online vibe‚Äôs off, and 21% say bad search results killed their love life. Take Justine Sacco: one dumb tweet about Africa and AIDS went viral, torching her dating prospects as the story dominated her Google results.

Old party pics or ex-drama online? Good luck finding a match.

Your social circle can suffer too. A bad rep leads to isolation‚Äî21% have lost friends over negative content. Studies tie problematic social media to depression (0.273 correlation), anxiety (0.348), and stress (0.313), straining relationships. The Ashley Madison hack exposed thousands, leading to divorces and social shunning. Holly Jones faced backlash from an insensitive tweet, losing friends fast. If a viral meme or old drama resurfaces, your crew might distance themselves to avoid the heat.

Professionally, it‚Äôs a nightmare. 70% of recruiters check your online rep, and 80% have rejected candidates over negative finds. 95% of companies use social media for hiring, with 73% on LinkedIn. 21% have lost jobs or promotions due to online dirt. Kathy Griffin‚Äôs Trump photo tweet cost her gigs and sparked investigations. Gilbert Gottfried got canned from Aflac for Japan tsunami tweets.

Roseanne Barr‚Äôs racist tweet killed her show.

Regular folks aren‚Äôt safe either‚Äîa nurse lost her job over a patient-ranting Facebook post, and a teacher was fired for bikini vacation pics.

For freelancers, bad reviews can kill clients; one negative article causes 22% customer loss. Companies with bad reps pay 10% more to hire talent, and 69% of job seekers avoid them.

Your wallet feels it too. 21% report financial losses from online issues. Influencers like PewDiePie lost subscribers and deals after a racial slur video.

JK Rowling‚Äôs tweets sparked book sale boycotts.

H&M took a sales hit from a controversial ad.

Job hunting? 67% of employers screen social media, and bad finds crush your chances.

So, here‚Äôs the fix: 

Google yourself weekly, post positive content like charity work or achievements, and engage with your audience. If negative stuff pops up, get help to clean it up. Don‚Äôt let online drama steal your shine‚Äîtake control now!

Good!

I prefer no name jokes, because, y'know - I've heard them my whole life. I'm sure you're wondering why I've gathered you all today, and there's only one reason: I want friends. I look around at the end of the day and realize that I have a friend deficit. How do you even properly make friends as an adult? Clearly, the Internet is the answer.

*Who am I?*

‚Ä¢ A 31 year old glutton for punishment.
‚Ä¢ I went to school for Social Work, hoping that it would provide an avenue for my goal of helping more people than I ever hurt. 
‚Ä¢ I walk too fast and talk too slow.
‚Ä¢ I curse far too much and laugh too loud. (Maybe you know what it's like to be ""too much"" too?)
‚Ä¢ I have an unmistakable southern twang that happens to be growing on me.¬†
‚Ä¢ I bastardize every DIY project I attempt.
‚Ä¢ I've been called a lot of things, but quirky is the most common.

*What are my interests?*

‚Ä¢ Reading - I've started reviewing books and even started getting ARC reads from authors!
‚Ä¢ Gaming - I have an Xbox and I am currently addicted to Disney Dreamlight Valley while also loving Fortnite and Borderlands. I love silly games like Overcooked and Jackbox too!
‚Ä¢ Creativity¬†- whether it's making a cute book review card, coloring with my alcohol markers, painting from a YouTube tutorial, or junk journaling, I love anything that allows me some freedom to express myself!
‚Ä¢ Traveling - I enjoy cruises, a lot, but particularly love anything near the water or going somewhere that gives me an excuse to fly. I also love checking out new places for my urbex hobby!

*What are things I don't like?*

‚Ä¢ Coffee. (I know, a cardinal sin!)
‚Ä¢ People only interested in explicit exchange.
‚Ä¢ Toll roads.
‚Ä¢ Sushi.
‚Ä¢ Action movies. (I LOVE horror or thriller movies!)
‚Ä¢ One word or single emoji messages.

*What am I looking for?*

I don't want small talk. Text me, and without saying hello, tell me why you got so angry at your sister this morning. Tell me why you have a scar shaped like Europe on the left side of your neck. Send me paragraphs about the time you spent at your grandmother's house that one summer. Call me when I'm half asleep and tell me why you believe in God. Tell me about the first time you saw your dad cry. Go on for hours about things that may not seem important, because I promise that I'll be hanging on to every word you say. Tell me everything you want and nothing you don't.

Let's be honest, I doubt anyone here really wants to just greet each other and enter the endless cycle of ""what are you up to?"" and ""nothing, what are you up to?"" Let's talk about a song that describes you, the last time you lied, and what brought each of us here.

After all of my rambling, if you made it this far, you deserve a medal. You're my kind of people! What made you smile today?¬†

1n14123,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1n14123/the_woman_from_victrola/,The Woman from Victrola,"Marcus had been coming to Victrola Coffee for three weeks now, ever since he'd signed the lease on the apartment six blocks away. The wedding ring was gone but his finger still felt its ghost‚Äîa pale band of skin that caught fluorescent light wrong, made him keep his left hand moving, wrapped around his coffee mug or buried in his pocket like evidence.

His lawyer's email glowed on the laptop screen, something about Sarah wanting makeup time for a ski trip to Whistler. President's Day weekend. She needed his answer by Thursday for booking purposes, would trade for his Spring Break week. The language was so careful, so scrubbed of feeling. Like they hadn't spent fourteen years together. Like she hadn't fucked her CrossFit coach in their bed while the kids were at school.

The coffee shop breathed around him. Morning sounds. The hiss and gurgle of machines, Tom√°s calling out someone's flat white, two women laughing about something on a phone screen. Rain streaked the windows, turning Capitol Hill into an impressionist painting.

""Is this the Times or the P-I?""

A woman stood near his table holding an actual newspaper, yellowed and carefully preserved. She wore a burgundy dress that belonged in someone's grandmother's closet, but she made it look intentional. Leather gloves the color of dried blood.

""Sorry?""

She held up the paper. ""December 3rd, 1999. Found it at an estate sale in Wallingford. Look‚Äî'Seattle Prepares for Y2K: City Officials Urge Calm.' Funny what used to keep us up at night.""

""The world ending because computers couldn't count?""

""That's what everyone thinks, but actually‚Äî"" She stopped herself, laughed. ""Sorry. I dated a programmer who explained it to me for three hours once. Something about two-digit year storage. I'm still not sure if he was mansplaining or just really, really passionate about COBOL.""

The laugh transformed her face, asymmetric and unexpected. Marcus found himself laughing too, surprising himself with how it felt‚Äîrusty but real.

""Both, probably. Programmers contain multitudes.""

""Serena."" She extended her gloved hand.

""Marcus."" 

Her handshake was firm but even through the leather, her hand felt cold. Not winter cold. Something else.

""I collect them,"" she said, gesturing at the paper. ""Old newspapers. Estate sales are gold mines for dead people's anxieties. Everyone saved the disasters that never quite happened.""

""Morbid hobby.""

""Says the man staring at lawyer emails before 8 AM.""

He looked down at his screen, then back at her. ""Fair point.""

""I should let you get back to it."" But she lingered for a moment, shifting the newspaper under her arm. ""I'm here most mornings if you ever want a break from whatever that is. I'll be the one reading about obsolete catastrophes.""

She walked to the counter, and Marcus found himself watching. The way she waited for her coffee‚Äîpatient, still, like she had nowhere else to be. When Tom√°s handed her the cup, she wrapped both hands around it and closed her eyes, conducting some private ritual with the heat.

* * *

Wednesday she came in ten minutes after him, rain dripping from a black umbrella. She nodded, took a table by the window. He tried to focus on his client's network architecture but kept noticing things‚Äîhow she held her pencil wrapped in that strange grip, thumb over index finger. How she pressed her hands against her coffee cup between sketches like she was stealing its warmth.

Thursday the rain turned biblical. She rushed in, soaked despite the umbrella, water beading on wool.

""Can I?"" She pointed at his empty chair. ""The window seats are taken and I'll freeze by the door.""

""Please.""

She set down her coffee‚Äîhe heard her ask Tom√°s to make it extra hot‚Äîand pulled out an iPad. ""Working on a rebrand for a coffee company. The irony isn't lost on me."" The screen showed elegant typography over coffee plants. ""They want 'authenticity' and 'heritage' even though they started in 2019.""

""Manufactured nostalgia.""

""Exactly. But it pays well."" She pulled her gloves back on before touching the screen. ""The cold makes my joints ache. Early arthritis, my mom had it too. Genetic lottery.""

They worked in comfortable quiet. When she left, she paused at his table.

""Same time tomorrow?""

The question felt bigger than it was.

""I'll be here.""

* * *

Friday arrived gray and tired. Marcus had already fielded texts from Sarah about Ben's soccer gear, snacks for the team, whether he remembered, whether he cared, whether he was going to disappoint them like‚Äîshe didn't finish, but he could complete the sentence in multiple ways.

Serena was already there, newspapers spread across her table like tarot cards.

""Big haul?"" He set down his coffee.

""October 1962."" She held up a headline: CUBAN MISSILE CRISIS DEEPENS. ""Estate sale in Greenwood. The owner kept every paper from that month. His grandson said he was convinced it was the end of the world.""

""Cheerful.""

""I like seeing how people lived when they thought everything might end. They still went to work. Still got married. Still fought about baseball."" She folded the paper with careful hands. ""Makes the present feel manageable.""

His phone buzzed. Sarah again. Ben didn't want to go to soccer, and Marcus better not let him skip just because it was his weekend.

""Kids?"" Serena asked, reading something in his face.

The word usually changed things. People either backed away or leaned in too hard, neither comfortable. But Marcus was tired of managing other people's reactions.

""Two. Ten and twelve. My weekend with them.""

""Weekend dad."" Matter-of-fact, no weight to it. ""My father was one of those. Every other Friday to Sunday, two weeks in summer. We got very good at miniature golf.""

""Did it get easier?""

She wrapped her hands around her mug, considering. ""Different. We developed our own language, separate from my mom's house. Pancakes for dinner, terrible movies, staying up talking about nothing. The nothing was the best part.""

His phone lit up. Sarah. The library book in Lily's backpack.

""Your ex?""

""We're still figuring out the boundaries."" He turned the phone face down. ""Three weeks since I moved out, but we've been done longer than that. Now it's just logistics and little cruelties.""

""The real American pastime."" She pulled out her iPad, but then stopped. ""I'm hungry. Want to grab lunch? There's a Thai place on Pine that makes soup hot enough to strip paint.""

He checked the time. Kids at five.

""Sure.""

* * *

The restaurant was narrow, overheated, windows fogged with steam. Serena went straight for the table under the heat lamp, sighing as she sat.

""Fair warning,"" she said, unwinding her scarf, ""I'm basically a lizard. Always cold, always seeking heat. It's not very attractive, but it's honest.""

""Should I worry about you sunning yourself on rocks?""

""Only in summer. Which in Seattle means those three days in August."" She ordered tom yum soup, extra spicy, and tom kha gai. ""I lived in Phoenix for two years after college. Loved the heat, hated everything else. But December in Seattle makes me reconsider.""

""What brought you here?""

""A startup that died two weeks after I arrived. Classic‚Äîbig promises, no money. But I stayed anyway. The gray suits me, philosophically if not physically.""

The soup arrived, steam rising. She leaned over it, breathing deep.

""So what's your story? Besides divorce and coffee addiction?""

""Network security consultant. Freelance, which means I either have too much work or I'm convinced I'll never work again."" He stirred his pad thai. ""Been in Seattle twelve years. Moved here for Sarah's job at Microsoft.""

""How's that feel to say?""

""Like the truth. She fell in love with someone else. Her CrossFit coach, because my life is a clich√©. But honestly, we'd been strangers in the same house for years. Took someone else to make us admit it.""

She nodded, that particular nod of recognition. ""The slow fade. No villain, no big moment. Just waking up one day and realizing you're alone in a room with another person.""

""Exactly that.""

""I was engaged once. Six months. But I realized I loved being chosen more than I loved him specifically. Poor bastard deserved better than being someone's proof of worth.""

""That's very self-aware.""

""Therapy. Years of therapy. My therapist says I have attachment issues. I said I'm attached to plenty‚Äîheat, coffee, old newspapers. She didn't laugh.""

His phone lit up. Sarah again.

""Check it,"" Serena said. ""Kids trump lunch.""

Rain boots. Lily needed them for Monday's field trip. His responsibility, his weekend.

""Rain boots,"" he told Serena. ""Apparently the world ends without rain boots.""

""What size?""

""What?""

""There's a consignment shop two blocks over. We could grab them after lunch. Unless you have plans?""

Something shifted in his chest. ""No, that would be‚Äîyes. Thank you.""

* * *

The shop smelled like lavender and other people's lives. Serena went straight to the shoes.

""Ladybugs or dinosaurs?""

""Lily says dinosaurs are for babies now.""

""Harsh. These?"" Purple boots with constellations.

""Perfect.""

She insisted on paying. ""Divorce present. Everyone gives wedding presents, nobody celebrates getting free.""

Walking back, the light already failing, she stopped at the corner.

""This was nice. I don't usually‚ÄîI'm not good at the people thing. But this was nice.""

""Yeah. It was.""

She pulled out her phone, fingers clumsy in the gloves. ""Could I‚Äîwould you want to exchange numbers? In case I find newspapers about network disasters?""

She sent a test text: *This is Serena, the lizard woman who bought your daughter space boots.*

""See you Monday?""

""I'll be there.""

* * *

That night, after bedtime stories and dishes and Ben's passionate defense of goalkeepers, Marcus sat in his half-furnished living room. The kids slept in the bedroom he'd assembled three weeks ago‚ÄîIKEA bunk beds, matching dressers, a world map rug Lily had insisted on.

His phone buzzed.

Serena: *How'd the boots go over?*

Marcus: *She declared them ""acceptable"" which from a 12-year-old is basically the Nobel Prize*

Serena: *High praise. My work here is done.*

Then a photo‚Äîa newspaper headline: SOVIET UNION LAUNCHES SPUTNIK, AMERICA WATCHES THE SKIES.

Serena: *Found this in my collection. The original network security panic.*

Marcus: *Just a beeping basketball in space and everyone lost their minds*

Serena: *""Beeping Basketball in Space"" is my band name called it*

They texted for an hour. Easy, loose, the kind of conversation he'd forgotten existed. Sarah's texts were all logistics and sharp edges. But here was this strange woman with her cold hands and vintage anxieties, making him laugh in his empty apartment.

Serena: *I should sleep. Coffee people want three concepts by Monday. Time to manufacture some heritage.*

Marcus: *May your fonts convey sufficient authenticity*

Serena: *From your lips to the design gods' ears*

Later, one more text in the dark:

Serena: *BTW tom yum soup is a perfectly valid breakfast. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.*

He smiled at his phone, already knowing what he'd reply, already looking forward to Monday. It wasn't much‚Äîa woman who collected dead people's newspapers and wore gloves indoors and made him forget, for whole minutes at a time, the wreckage he was living in.

But it was something. A warm spot in all that cold.",2,1756258270.0,scarystories,0,0.75,False

1n14086,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n14086/theres_a_corpse_in_the_freezer_at_work/,There's a Corpse in the Freezer at Work,"Across many ancient religions, blood was considered sacred. The Mesopotamians believed humans were formed from the blood of a slain god. In Greek mythology, the divine blood of the gods‚Äîcalled ichor‚Äîheld supernatural properties. And perhaps most famously, Levitical law in the Torah forbids the consumption of animal blood, declaring it the seat of life.

These are just a few of many examples, but the point is clear: there‚Äôs something about blood we don‚Äôt fully understand.

I work in a bioanalytical lab, where my job is to analyze blood and plasma for drug levels, diseases, or whatever else my boss says we‚Äôre after. Or at least, that‚Äôs what I signed up for. Most days, I‚Äôm just pulling plasma samples for hours. Easy work. But monotonous. Repetitive.

We store the samples in a walk-in freezer, locked with a heavy latch, until the day before we need them. Then we line them up on the counters before we leave, so they‚Äôll thaw overnight and be ready by the next shift.

This is my first job like this, and the one thing I wasn‚Äôt prepared for was the smell. Plasma stinks. Not like excrement‚Äînothing sharp or sour. It‚Äôs a sickly sweet odor that clings to the air. Every breath brings the stench of pus. Breathing through your mouth doesn‚Äôt help. It just means you taste it.

I‚Äôve grown to hate plasma. It‚Äôs the liquid part of blood, but don‚Äôt imagine something clean or clear. It varies from sample to sample‚Äîcolors ranging from bright red to dark amber, to orange, to a jaundiced yellow. Some look almost translucent. Others are thick, polluted, with solid chunks drifting inside like jellyfish in a jar. I hate them the most.

Taking samples means handling racks and racks of empty vials. I work through them one by one: take a bottle, pry it open with metal tongs, and squeeze out the disgusting concoction until each tube is half full.

I‚Äôve gotten chunks on my gloves more than once. Every time, I insist on changing them. Without the surrounding liquid, the solid bits look like fleshy snot.

Still, the job isn‚Äôt all bad. I share a bench with one other guy‚ÄîFrancis. He‚Äôs a year younger than me, but he‚Äôs been here longer‚Äîabout nine months. It took a bit to warm up to each other on my first day, but once we did, we‚Äôd joke and trade stories as we sampled and labeled bottles.

He told me about his family, about this absurdly rich couple he sometimes house-sits for‚Äîhow they pay him stupid amounts of money to do practically nothing.

And then there‚Äôs his favorite: the ghost that supposedly haunts the lab. According to him, it opens boxes, undoes the freezer latch, and bangs on the inside wall when you‚Äôre too deep in thought to notice.

Our manager knows the ghost story too. It‚Äôs mostly a joke‚Äîan easy excuse when one of us forgets something or leaves the freezer door cracked.

But I did hear the noises a few times while Francis was still around. Nothing worth writing home about. Just soft knocks or the faint clink of a latch shifting. The kind of thing you'd chalk up to the building settling.

Then, a few weeks ago, Francis stopped showing up. No call, no notice. Just gone. Very unlike him. He‚Äôs got a family to support, and this job was his main source of income.

But things happen, you know? Maybe he had some emergency, found a better job. Hell, maybe he won the lottery and decided to say screw this place. I wouldn‚Äôt have blamed him. If only.

I should mention something about the plasma we work with. It comes in bottles, sealed tight, packed in cardboard boxes. Each is labeled‚Äîdonor name, lot number, inventory codes. Everything accounted for. Or it‚Äôs supposed to be. We‚Äôre not allowed to sample anything without checking the label first.

I remember Francis would sometimes tell me we were missing a few samples. He mentioned it more towards the end of his time at the lab.

Now that he was gone, I was the one trying to hunt down our missing samples. It isn‚Äôt the end of the world and it is certainly explainable. Someone forgot to ship something, someone did ship something somewhere they weren‚Äôt supposed to, or maybe someone just lost them.

Usually, we notify our suppliers who either send us more or cancel the order.

But it‚Äôs been so consistent recently. I suppose our resident ghost has been active.

I joke, but it was getting a bit strange. Francis‚Äôs supposed supernatural encounters got worse too. I think it stopped being a joke to him. The guy got pretty freaked out.

He used up all his sick time to stay away from work, and did all he could to only be in the lab if me or someone else was there too. I brought it up to him once and he explained it to me, but not in depth.

Banging from the inside of the freezer. And voices. He had been hearing voices. I could tell by his tone that he wasn‚Äôt giving me the full story.

But he seemed so genuinely afraid, I figured I didn‚Äôt want to push him to speak about something he was clearly uncomfortable with.

That being said, I never heard the banging or the voices, or whatever else was clearly bothering him. No, what really started bothering me were the damned missing samples. It got to the point where almost every order was missing several bottles‚Äîsometimes whole boxes.

I would take stock of our samples the night before, lock them in the fridge, only for them to be missing the next day. And I would have no issue with this, I didn‚Äôt pay for the stuff. But when they went missing, I was the one stuck scavenging the lab‚Äîor worse, writing a report.

I brought it up to my manager but he always played it off. Made it seem like no big deal. Which it wasn‚Äôt, I suppose. But my manager has always been a stickler. He once had me spend 2 whole shifts triple checking inventory because the intern miscounted. He is not the type of person to just brush this off.

Eventually, I decided to check the inventory myself. Box by box. Pallet by pallet. Including the ones in the freezer. Even the ones in the back.

I don‚Äôt like going into the freezer. We keep it very, very cold. So cold that when you walk in, it almost knocks the wind out of you. The white, condensed air is so thick you can only see a few feet in front of you.

The freezer has just enough room for 8 pallets, stacked in 2 rows of 4 from front to back. And so, I latched the door behind me - the alarm goes off if you don‚Äôt - and started with pallet number one.

The boxes are heavy, and I went through what felt like hundreds. My shoulders, arms, and back ached as I unpacked a pallet, searched every box, checked every bottle, only to restack it after not finding my samples. I didn‚Äôt sweat. It was far too cold for that. I had to take breaks in between pallets to go back outside and heat up.

Things didn‚Äôt get strange until pallet 4. Midway through I heard tapping - light, barely audible. Like someone was tapping on the outside of the freezer wall the same way you would a fish bowl. I paid it no mind - not even Francis‚Äôs ghost would stop me from finding those plasma bottles. I was not about to come in on Saturday to find them. On my next break, I wandered into the manager‚Äôs office. I kicked the frost from the latch and shoved the door open then headed down the hall to warm up. He keeps everything on paper so I figured I‚Äôd check the shipment logs myself. Just to be sure we ever received the missing boxes at all. At first, everything looked normal. Shipping dates. Lot numbers. Supplier names. But a few pages in, I found a folder tucked between two binders with no label. Just red pen marks on the spine. Inside were handwritten entries. Not in the usual format. Sample IDs I didn‚Äôt recognize. Next to them, in neat little columns: ‚ÄúRejected.‚Äù ‚ÄúDrained.‚Äù ‚ÄúVessel.‚Äù And beyond that, the notes became more like erratic drawings. Circular sketches. Veins drawn like constellations. And one that sticks in my head even now. It showed what looked like a throne of twisting, blood-filled tubes. Above it was a phrase written in red ink, in all caps: ‚ÄúSANGUIS EX SOMNO.‚Äù Blood from sleep. Another series of tapping jolted me back to reality. I closed the folder and stepped back, trying to shake off the unease creeping into my spine. The notes were weird, sure. The drawings were worse. But maybe it was just some kind of joke, or old training material, or hell‚Äîmaybe the manager‚Äôs into occult nonsense. It didn‚Äôt mean anything. Probably. Still, one of the sample IDs stuck in my head. I remembered it from earlier‚Äîhalf-covered in frost on the bottom row of pallet four. I hadn‚Äôt opened that box yet. And as much as I wanted to walk out, slam the office door, and pretend none of this happened‚Ä¶ I needed to know. If that box was missing too‚Äîfine. But if it was there? Then maybe I'd finally get some answers. I went back and finished restacking pallet 4, which did not yield me my prize. The condensation was thicker now, even the floor had frozen over like an ice skating rink. It was time for a break. Maybe even a cup of coffee to warm me.

I shuffled my way to the exit latch and pulled with all my might, but it didn‚Äôt budge. Panic filled my stomach and throat. I yanked harder, desperately trying to get out, but it may as well have been a vault.

I banged on the door and yelled at the top of my lungs for my manager. But it was no use and I knew it. He told me he was going to make a delivery and wouldn‚Äôt be back for another hour or 2.

I tried to calm myself, panic wouldn‚Äôt help me. It‚Äôs likely something was caught on the sliding freezer door, keeping it stuck in place from the outside.

But there must be another way out, another safety feature somewhere in here. I fumbled through the white fog, shivering, groping for the wall in front of me. I felt around as I shifted down the walls, like someone looking for a lightswitch in the dark.

I got to the back wall and noticed the difference in texture immediately. It was smooth. And colder than the previous wall. Solid, transparent ice, like a one way mirror. I looked up from my hands to the wall and fell backwards in fear.

Frozen inside was a corpse. Eyeless, shriveled like an old piece of beef jerky. Mouth agape in a silent scream. Its withered hand reached out to put its palm on the surface of the ice.

I staggered to my feet and tried to collect myself. A frozen body wasn‚Äôt immediately dangerous to me, terrifying as it was. After a moment, it dawned on me just how familiar it looked.

I leaned against the ice, trying to get a better look through the building condensation. The figure looked mummified. Hollow and ruined. But the face.

I knew that face.

My eyes dropped to the hand on the glass. There was a ring on the finger. Simple. Cheap. Blue stone.

Francis‚Äôs ring.

My thoughts didn‚Äôt have time to race before I heard it.

Crack.

A sound like a dam breaking.

A spiderweb of splinters and cracks formed on the wall that separated me and my once coworker. The epicenter of which I traced back to the corpse‚Äôs palm.

Before I could process what was happening, before I could flee, Francis breached the ice, wrapped his arms around my shoulders, and pulled me through the ice.

I feel through darkness. Through nothingness, until I landed hard on my back on something plastic and pointed. It was like being dropped into an ocean made of broken toys..

I struggled to the top of this ocean only to see the impossible hellscape I had been abducted into.

An ocean of bottles. Bottles of blood. Of plasma. Some sealed, some cracked open. All of them leaking that horrid, inescapable stench. That sickly-sweet, curdled smell that clung to my throat and eyes.

Above me, the sky was the same color as the yellow plasma I had grown so familiar with. Murky, sour, and thick with light that didn‚Äôt feel like light at all.

Every breath made me gag. Every movement I made put pressure on the bottles beneath me, which would in turn squirt its chunky, putrid contents onto me. As I crawled desperately, not an inch of me was spared.

As my brain struggled to process my new Hell, I noticed the only thing there was to notice. In this ocean of filth was a hill. A hill of the same bottles stood like a monument several meters away from me.

I made my way to it, an agonizing crawl of bodily fluids and sharp plastic. I vomited more than once on the way.

But, eventually, I did make it there.

It wasn‚Äôt a hill, rather it was a perch. On it stood what looked like a mockery of an ornate throne. Blood clots for gems, and made almost entirely of veins, capillaries, and sinews. Just like my manager had drawn.

On it, sat what once was Francis. The same posture, the same silent scream. His hollow eyes bore into me with an intensity that forced me to my knees. As if gravity had increased on my shoulders.

New figures had emerged now. Maybe they‚Äôd been there the whole time, and I was too panicked to see. Maybe they‚Äôd risen from the ocean of filth around me. I couldn‚Äôt say.

I recognized many of them. They had traded their lab coats for hoods and robes. They stood in a half circle around the throne, all of their attention on me and the corpse. I don‚Äôt remember standing. I don‚Äôt remember walking. But I was face to face with it now. Francis - or what he was now - watched me from the throne. But something else moved beneath his skin. A pulsing, writhing thing that stirred the veins like puppet strings. Its hollow mouth twitched. Opened. And then I screamed. Blood poured from my nose. My ears. My eyes. It welled up in my throat and spilled from my lips, thick and hot. The taste of metal overpowered even the stench of plasma. There was a sound that wasn‚Äôt a sound at all. A feeling rather? A vibration deep in my marrow, a wordless hunger. It was pulling me. My veins, my bones, my very cells. The corpse was going to drink me as if through a straw.

Then a new sensation - cold. My palms were cold.

My body knew what to do before my mind did. I pushed with all my might against nothing. Against the air, like miming the act of forcing open a sealed door..

I pushed with every ounce of my being, fighting for my life to escape my fate.

I successfully pushed myself off of the ice wall. I stumbled backwards into a pallet and looked up - still face to face with the corpse.

A deafening howl came from its mouth. Its outstretched, withered arm banged on the ice in a furious rage.

I ran to the door, slipping on frost as I went but never falling.

The freezer door was ahead, fogged and rimmed with frost.

The latch was still jammed, but I didn‚Äôt care. I threw my weight into it again and again, shoulder first, shouting until my throat tore.

Something gave.

A crack. A hiss. The seal broke.

I feel forward into the lab, shivering and pale. I stood and immediately slammed the door shut, latching it behind me once again.

I kept running until I reached my car. I never knew my car could reach that speed - I must've halved the time it takes to normally get home.

Even there, I didn't stay long. I packed up everything I thought I may need and took off again, this time to the airport.

That brings me to now - typing this on my laptop during a flight. I‚Äôm not going to tell you where to.

I have no idea how far this goes. How deep those people have infiltrated my field. And I don‚Äôt plan on risking it again.

I‚Äôm staying as far away as I can from anything even remotely related to bloodwork. And I plan to do so far, far away from that place.

That being said - I plan to update again,

for my own safety.

Lots of great things have come from it, but there are some lingering issues and I can't help but wonder if it's the morning coffee.

I've been putting this off--knowing I need to try it--for several weeks now.

My wife dove in and she's been off coffee for 5 days now. Says it's helping her sleep. 

But she also drinks iced tea like it's water, and has her whole life since she was little so...

Being a fan of Dr Chaffee, I remember seeing one of his videos in which he said something like ""80% of your gains can come from getting rid of that last 5% of non-carnivore things you're still doing..."" and he was kind of like ""looking at you coffee drinkers"" (although that's totally not his vibe--he's such a chill guy so take all that with the usual grain...just as long as it's salt and not wheat. lol).

Meanwhile, I've finally arrived at the point where I pretty much just have coffee left when it comes to plants in my diet.

I feel like I have to rule out its possible effects on the last bits of inflammation I'm trying to ditch (a bit in the gut and feet) and the Charlie horse type cramping that occurs when I stretch too hard or get into certain positions.

Bottom line is that I realized I have quit coffee in the past, but I wasn't carnivore at the time. So I've never really given the carnivore WOE its full chance to heal my body. If I've been robbing my body of minerals every morning with my 2-3 espresso shots, or experiencing some other issue by virtue of it being a plant, I want to at least know that.

Today was a one-shot day, as I begin to titrate it back to 0, which will probably happen pretty quickly. I just don't want to kick off a week of headaches because the fairly intense mental days I typically have at work.

1n13xyu,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1n13xyu/the_long_way_home_louise_penny/,The Long Way Home - Louise Penny,"Hey everyone! I just finished reading **[The Long Way Home - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/the-long-way-home-louise-penny/)** and I couldn't wait to share my thoughts with you all. If you're looking for a book that's more than just a mystery ‚Äì one that really makes you think and feel ‚Äì then you might want to settle in for this one.

**A Quick, Spoiler-Free Peek:**
""The Long Way Home"" is a beautiful, sometimes heartbreaking, return to the world of Chief Inspector Armand Gamache and the quirky, charming village of Three Pines. This time, Gamache is no longer with the S√ªret√© du Qu√©bec, having retired (or rather, been pushed into it). He‚Äôs trying to find peace, but when Clara Morrow, the artist from Three Pines, asks for his help finding her estranged husband, Peter, who has vanished, Gamache finds himself drawn back into a deeply personal investigation. It‚Äôs not just about finding Peter; it‚Äôs about unraveling a tangled web of art, obsession, and the complex choices people make. This isn't your typical whodunit; it's more of a ""why-did-they-do-it"" with a whole lot of soul.

**What Really Stood Out For Me:**
First off, the characters in Louise Penny's books always feel like old friends, and in ""The Long Way Home,"" they shine. Gamache is, as always, incredibly wise and compassionate, but here we see him grappling with his own inner demons and trying to navigate a new chapter of his life. His quiet strength and thoughtful nature are such a comfort. The villagers of Three Pines, from the eccentric poet Ruth to the warmhearted bistro owners Gabri and Olivier, add so much warmth and humor to the story.

The writing style is simply gorgeous. Penny has a way of painting vivid pictures with her words, making you feel like you're right there in Three Pines, sipping coffee at the bistro or walking through the autumn leaves. She delves deep into the human psyche, exploring themes of love, betrayal, regret, and the nature of art. It‚Äôs incredibly moving, and I found myself pausing often just to let the emotions sink in. The pacing is deliberate, not a fast-action thriller, but a slow burn that builds tension beautifully through character development and emotional depth.

**What Might Not Be For Everyone (And Why That's Okay!):**
If you're looking for a super fast-paced, plot-driven mystery where bodies drop every other chapter, this might feel a little slow at first. Louise Penny takes her time, letting you get to know the characters and the setting, building the atmosphere before the mystery fully unfolds. But trust me, this slower pace is what allows the emotional core of the story to truly resonate. It‚Äôs less about the thrill of the chase and more about the journey of understanding.

**Would I Recommend It? Absolutely!**
Yes, I wholeheartedly recommend ""The Long Way Home."" It's a rich, contemplative, and deeply satisfying read that offers so much more than a simple mystery. If you love character-driven stories, atmospheric settings, and books that explore the complexities of human nature, then this is definitely for you. It's perfect for fans of psychological fiction and anyone who enjoys a mystery that lingers in your mind long after you've turned the last page. It‚Äôs a wonderful example of how powerful and moving a mystery novel can be. You can find more details about the book here: **[The Long Way Home - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/the-long-way-home-louise-penny/)**.

**A Little Tip for New Readers:**
If you're new to the Gamache series, or even just new to reading this kind of book, here‚Äôs a little secret: embrace the journey. Don't feel pressured to rush through. Let yourself get lost in the descriptions, ponder the characters' decisions, and allow the emotions to wash over you. Sometimes, a book needs a little time to unfold, just like a friendship. If you find yourself enjoying this one, know that there's a whole wonderful series waiting for you! It's such a rewarding experience to dive into a world and truly live there for a while.

So, if you're ready for an emotional mystery that will stay with you, I encourage you to pick up **[The Long Way Home - Louise Penny](https://pdfhive.com/the-long-way-home-louise-penny/)**. Happy reading, everyone!",1,1756258027.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

It‚Äôs out of control. If we want Canada to stay a rules-based, high-trust society, here‚Äôs what needs to change:

1. **Real penalties.** Jail time + asset seizures for shady consultants/employers selling fake LMIAs. Stop treating fraud like a parking ticket.
2. **Surprise inspections.** Paper audits don‚Äôt cut it. Do unannounced visits ‚Äî find out if ‚ÄúFood Service Supervisors‚Äù are just pouring coffee.
3. **Public blacklist.** Canadians deserve to know which employers, colleges, and consultants are banned. Sunlight = accountability.
4. **Tie immigration to capacity.** Levels must track housing starts, ER wait times, unemployment ‚Äî not political spin.
5. **Protect workers, not abusers.** Open permits for exploited workers so they can report fraud without fear.
6. **Balance the intake.** No single country or sector should dominate. Immigration should be broad, fair, and genuinely diverse.

Canadians need to stop just complaining online.  
We need to actually do something:

* **Write your MP.** Fill their inbox. Make them feel the pressure.
* **Protest.** Peaceful, visible, impossible to ignore.
* **Talk about it.** Share, post, and push back against the ‚Äúshrug and accept it‚Äù attitude.

If we don‚Äôt demand change, nothing changes. The fraudsters and shady middlemen sure as hell won‚Äôt reform themselves.

Now let me be perfectly clear: This isn‚Äôt ‚Äúanti-immigrant.‚Äù It‚Äôs pro-fairness. It‚Äôs pro-trust.

What separates Canada from much of the world, what keeps us prosperous, is that people believe rules are enforced and institutions can be trusted. That trust is eroding. And when trust erodes, decline follows. A country that tolerates systemic fraud is a country sliding into instability.

And yes, I‚Äôll never forgive Trudeau for what he‚Äôs done to this system. But he wasn‚Äôt wrong about one thing: Diversity is our strength!

Why? Because Canada isn‚Äôt just one diaspora. It‚Äôs Ukrainians in the Prairies, Italians in Toronto, Portuguese in Montreal, Filipinos in healthcare, Vietnamese running small businesses, Somalis and Ethiopians building communities, Colombians and Mexicans contributing in cities and farms, Chinese and Korean Canadians driving innovation and trade. These communities, layered over generations, make Canada resilient and unique.

The problem is, what we have now isn‚Äôt true diversity. It‚Äôs an over-reliance on one pipeline, one network, one overconcentration. That‚Äôs not diversity, that‚Äôs capture. Real diversity means balanced, fair, rules-based intake that draws from everywhere, not just one corner.

**TL;DR:** Canada‚Äôs immigration system is broken because of fraud and over-reliance on one pipeline. What we need is rules-first, fair, and truly diverse immigration:

* Jail time for fraud, not small fines.
* Surprise inspections & a public blacklist of banned employers/colleges.
* Intake tied to housing/health capacity.
* Real diversity, Ukrainians, Filipinos, Italians, Chinese, Colombians, Africans, South Asians, Middle Easterners, everyone contributing fairly, not just one group gaming the system.

(8) You must have intentionally brought it about that you had that nature n, in which case you must have existed already with a prior nature in the light of which you intentionally brought it about that you had the nature n in the light of which you intentionally brought it about that you are the way you now are....

Here one is setting off on the regress. Nothing can be cause of itself in the required way.


**The Alex O'Connor argument:**

1. All actions are either forced or wanted . 
2. Forced actions are not free . 
3. Wanted actions are not free: because you don't control your desires. You discover your desires rather than choosing them, and even trying to control them requires a desire that you can't control. 
4. This creates a dilemma: if you're not forced, you must be acting on a want, but since you don't control your wants, your action isn't free. 
5. The alternative: If an action is not determined by anything, it is random. Randomness also means you are not in control of the action, rendering it not free

**No branching paths argument:**

Premise 1: If a person has free will, then they must have the ability to have done otherwise than they actually did. For example, if you chose coffee this morning, you must have been able to choose tea instead for your choice to be considered free.

Premise 2: Determinism is the thesis that the state of the universe at any one time, combined with the laws of nature, entails all future truths about the universe. In a deterministic universe, there is only one possible future consistent with the laws of nature and the past.

Premise 3: Because determinism implies that the future is already set, it is never possible to have done otherwise. A deterministic universe has only one single path, with no forks or branches.
Conclusion: Therefore, if determinism is true, free will is not possible

**The standard argument against free will:**


    1. Determinism:
    If determinism is true, then every event, including human actions, is the inevitable consequence of prior events and the laws of nature. If this is the case, then our actions are determined by circumstances outside our control, meaning we aren't free. 
2. Indeterminism:
If indeterminism is true, then some events are random or uncaused. However, random events are not something an agent can control or be responsible for, and thus they do not constitute free will. 

3. Conclusion:
Since events must be either determined or undetermined, and neither scenario allows for free will, free will cannot exist


**The Consequence Argument**
A specific form of the argument against free will, the Consequence Argument states that free will requires an ""ability to do otherwise"". 

    1. Assumption:
    It assumes determinism is true, meaning everything that happens is a consequence of past events and laws of nature.
    2. Premise:
    If determinism is true, then your choices and actions are determined by factors and events that occurred in the distant past, before you were even born.
    3. Conclusion:
    Since you have no control over the past or the laws of nature, you have no control over the present and future consequences of these factors, including your actions. Therefore, you could not have done anything other than what you did. 

**Sourcehood argument:**

    Premise 1 (Sourcehood is Necessary for Free Will):
    For an action to be free, the agent must be the ultimate source of that action.
    Premise 2 (Sourcehood Requires an Uncaused Event):
    For an agent to be the ultimate source, the conditions necessary for the action must originate with the agent, and there can be no prior sufficient conditions for those conditions. This implies an act of creation from nothing, or a moment of self-initiation.
    Premise 3 (Ultimacy is Impossible):
    It is impossible for any agent to be the ultimate source of their actions, either because of determinism (where past events and laws of nature determine the future) or an infinite causal regress of prior events.
    Conclusion:
    Therefore, no agent can have free will.

We have years of built up problems so it‚Äôs kind of hard to explain all of this with context to know how this person is and what we‚Äôve been through but I feel even without context things got blown over the top. 

It started with us leaving in the morning, he suggested getting food at a coffee shop on the way home. Once we got there he started subtly hinting/asking if I wanted to go sit down at a diner instead. I was kind of in a hurry to get home and also wanted the food at the coffee shop so I said I‚Äôd rather eat here. He got increasingly irritated and passive aggressive, saying things like ‚Äúit‚Äôs fine I‚Äôve just been nonstop going, can‚Äôt even sit down to relax, i took time out of my weekend to take you to this place‚Äù etc. but then said it was fine to eat there. It somehow turned into a fight, we didn‚Äôt end up getting any food, I got a coffee but was too uncomfortable to order food for myself since he refused to eat. 

The next hour or so it turned into him berating me. Telling me he‚Äôs ‚Äúnot safe‚Äù to tell me how he feels, he just wants to be heard and understood. We pulled over and it turns into screaming and telling me to shut the fuck up, get out of the car and I can walk home. ‚ÄúOh you won‚Äôt get out because im the only person who can take you home‚Äù we‚Äôre over 3 hours away at this point. 

And basically more berating over the next several hours. If I tried to say my side or ‚Äústick up‚Äù for myself he would be in a frenzy, speed up, threatened to crash the car and kill both of us. Told me he was going to punch me in the mouth. Called me a cunt, bitch, whore. Told me I don‚Äôt know how to love people. Said me and my mom were disgusting over a situation where she helped me move out of our old place. Wouldn‚Äôt let me drive. I was so anxious and worried I stopped saying anything because I just wanted to make it home. I can‚Äôt explain the feeling I have from that drive. 

I told him I would never treat him this way, and he says that I act like he‚Äôs worse because he‚Äôs reacting and calling me a name but I can make him feel unheard and unvalued??

1n13is0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskElectricians/comments/1n13is0/i_may_or_may_not_have_borked_something/,I may or may not have borked something,"I meant the title of this post very literally: I *don't* think I borked anything because I didn't do anything out of the ordinary. I do, however, think the room I'm living in was poorly wired, and failed without my having any way of knowing in advance this might happen.

Allow me to explain.

I recently moved. In my previous residence I rented a room from someone in the upper floor of their home. I work from home, and have a 3-monitor setup (two of which are TV's) with two computers, one a desktop and one a laptop. In that same room I also had a paper shredder hooked up as well as a TV that was literally never powered on. I also had a small USB-only power strip that only ever had a cell phone charger (2A) plugged into it that I didn't always use.

I had two surge protectors on two outlets for the computers, an external hard drive, cable modem, and router. The shredder and other TV (the one that didn't get used) were on separate outlets.

I never had a single problem with any electrical ever. It was only when I moved into this new place.

In this room I'm renting in this new residence there are three outlets: one with a wall-mounted air conditioner (5.6A), one with my computers and monitors, and another one with a mini fridge and a few other things.

[Power breakdown for everything in this room. Also, desktop computer power draw is likely actually around 4 amps, not 6. The coffee maker is 11.67A. Also, I only ran the coffee maker once on day two.](https://preview.redd.it/q5u8e0uymglf1.png?width=872&format=png&auto=webp&s=7d66b36f31a3a7aaff11b0273848403e8d5124a9)

[Component & power breakdown for my desktop computer](https://preview.redd.it/z8g61ebwmglf1.png?width=588&format=png&auto=webp&s=9eb80c747022e7c15ccf247bae4ccc43a6472425)

This room is also a remodel. The owners remodeled part of their patio into a covered, sealed-up sitting room with some glass windows on one side. It's actually a huge waste of time: it's hot, and they never bother with it. It's not air conditioned, either. There's a door leading outside, and then a door into the room I'm renting which was also remodeled and added later. This is why it has the wall-mounted AC instead of central AC.

My concern is the wiring in this room.

Everything was fine on the very first day. And night. And the *entire* day after. It was only after, on that second day, that I left for a couple of hours that everything went to shit.

I came home, and three of the breakers were flipped. The outlet that the fridge and other stuff were on was working fine; the breaker for them was probably the one that was not flipped (I haven't checked it). However, the other two outlets were *not* working.

My concern at first was the landlords. I might have forgotten to turn off the wall-mounted AC when I left for those few hours. I'm pretty sure everything was off. My landlord also complained about how much stuff I had (it's not much). Also, his English is poor, and his granddaughter described him as ""oldschool"" (which is code for ""he's a fucking idiot); also he's almost 90 and can't read, and he's pissy and yelled at me in front of the same granddaughter on day one for no reason. He's unaware that it's normal for people to keep track of payments and was very angry about having to do receipts for rent, which is why his English-speaking family made all of this happen.

Yes, this is a clusterfuck, but unfortunately this is how some of the country has to live, so please bear with me as you continue. Also, I'm getting to the point quite soon.

My suspicion at first is that my landlord entered my room, saw the air conditioner on, and flipped the circuit breaker off out of anger. So I thought to get a couple of hidden video cameras, which are on their way to me now.

My problem on top of this is what happened earlier today: the outlet with the AC and computers are working fine, but the one with the fridge on it stopped working entirely *and also without flipping the breaker*.

I panicked, but then went and got an extension cord and plugged in the fridge to the same outlet as the computers. This way, if the owners walked in, I could pretend everything was fine and dandy, but still panic that the ceiling fan wasn't on.

And then randomly the ceiling fan *did* come back on about an hour after I plugged the mini fridge. I only noticed this as I was typing out this post.

Suffice it to say, whoever wired this room did a monumentally shitty job. *Supremely* shitty.

So:

the appliances I'm using were working fine in the other house. I'm running *less* now than I was before, but ran into a serious problem that has apparently kind of resolved itself. I looked online, and one of the culprits of this could be a bad outlet; if the outlet and the fan are on the same line this could make sense.

What the fuck is going on, and what can I do about this while keeping it as quiet as possible?

Clarifying that I am not an electrician, but have pretty good reading comprehension skills and basic knowledge of electrical components and built my desktop computer from scratch.

\-edit-

The work they did was done without a permit:

There's no permit for the construction of this adjoining space.

And it has bad wiring they didn't know about.

I‚Äôll be in NYC around Christmas (late December) and I‚Äôd love to experience the city through the eyes of locals. I‚Äôm a 23-year-old guy, originally from Latvia, living in the UK now, and this is my first time visiting during the holidays.

I‚Äôm really interested in local culture, good conversations, and discovering what makes New York special beyond the usual tourist spots. If anyone wants to meet up for a coffee, a drink at a cozy bar, or just share recommendations for unique neighborhoods, events, or hidden gems ‚Äî I‚Äôd really appreciate it!",0,1756256553.0,NYCsocialclub,0,0.5,False

1n13chu,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n13chu,Questions about my backyard plants,"We are (casually) growing a few plants that were purchased on sale but have actually been somewhat thriving. Mostly tomato and pepper plants but a few other random things as well. Never really planned on doing anything with these but now that they are producing a little bit, what can we do to help them along a bit better? Nashville, TN. Over the next year we will hopefully get the real garden ready but this is what I have at the moment. (Pics of plants & names included.)

Specific Q‚Äôs:
Are the little spider webs on the plants helping or hurting? 
Are coffee grounds helpful? I‚Äôm a barista and am curious if bringing home grounds is worth it.

We also have a crepe myrtle that my parents love but keep killing. Any advice for those? Thanks!
