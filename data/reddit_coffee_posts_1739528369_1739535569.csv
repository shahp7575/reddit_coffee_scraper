1ip98z1,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ip98z1,Help with room layout - restricted due to small room and socket positions.,"I need your ideas on how to better layout this room in my new house. Firstly - I’m aware I ideally need new furniture. The first thing to go will be the blocky coffee table, hopefully replacing it with a circular, smaller one.

Secondly, the position of plugs, the radiator, as well as the space needed to allow for the door opening, has restricted me to this.

I hate the sofa being against the wall, and it feels too far away from the TV. 

I do have one idea as to how this can be improved, but I want any tips from you guys first.

Ps - I’m painting over that blue wall, can’t stand it haha.

Even if I train a lot it’s hard for me to lose fat and gain muscle. Turned 35 and need to lose about 10 kg gained during stressful period. 
My life is very busy and I don’t have much time to cook in these years and hence the weight gain.
I was on a meal plan and it was advertised as 1400ccal and I wasn’t losing weight and I know I can eat over 1400 when I train and lose weight so I realized any food that’s not home cooked by me is def too high calorie for me even if it looks healthy/supposed to be so.

To my fellow vegetarians who gained muscles past 35, please share your way of getting protein and calories.
I’m looking to build a sort of simple system and repeat daily as a habit. Or anything you can share on meal plans? I’m willing to try and different company in my city.
I’m looking to do something like a basic list of stuff I should be getting 
Breakfast: daily oats and a coffee, protein bar before gym
Lunch: grains/salad/protein (what kind?) 
Dinner: eggs with cheese and greens/greek yogurt with protein 

I have 0 time to cook but I always lose weight and never gain if I eat what I made, but with my current job it became impossible so looking for something simple I can repeat daily and hit my goals.

Hi everyone - I originally wrote this in March 2024, which was when the trial was again cancelled. A trial was set for November 2024 and that has also been cancelled and rescheduled. Please, please share this and hold the courts responsible!

2015 article from Las Vegas Review Journal (with my interview) - [https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/robert-dunns-own-family-wont-weep-if-he-is-put-to-death/](https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/robert-dunns-own-family-wont-weep-if-he-is-put-to-death/)

“This is a mindblowing story that spans across multiple decades with multiple victims” - direct quote from the Criminal Investigator for the DA’s office to me. January 29th, 2024 phone conversation beginning at 11:23 am EST, lasting for 16 minutes and 56 seconds.

\*\*The March trial was canceled because it was double booked with another trial.

THE MATH:

TWENTY-TWO YEARS since Joaquine and Eleanor Sierra were murdered, their bodies were put into garbage bins that were stored in a Las Vegas, NV storage unit.

TEN YEARS since he was arrested and still no trial. Multiple cancellations and reschedulings of hearings and trial dates.

The upcoming trial, set for March 18th, 2024 has been canceled…again.

SIXTEEN YEARS since I met him.

A VERY CONFUSING SUMMARY THAT STILL LEAVES OUT A LOT OF DETAILS ON THE CASE: 

Psycho commits multiple murders, fraud, etc. All the bad things, basically. Two of his victims met him prior to their murder - he was their caretaker. Stores bodies in a storage unit from 2003 to 2015 when I led authorities to the bodies. Marries me in 2008 (I was 25, he was 46.) Constant death threats, abuse and control daily. I try to tell people, no one believes me. He was on the run from the time he left me in 2011 to 2015. He is up against the death penalty. 

BUT WAIT, THERE’S MORE! I still don’t know the severity of the situation. 

FACTS:

From 2003 to 2015, The Sierras bodies were kept in garbage bins in a Las Vegas storage facility.

He stole their monthly social security deposits and continued to commit fraud against multiple people. 

HE HAS MULTIPLE VICTIMS!

He found the information of dead people via ancestry.com.

I (Joy Ike) married him in 2008. He used a false identity and shortly after our wedding, he told me of his nefarious acts.

He threatened to kill me on a daily basis.

June 4th, 2010 (Long Beach, CA): I placed a 911 phone call telling them that my “husband” had threatened to kill me. What followed was a day of multiple 911 calls where I told them what he had done. Because I’d lost sleep over the threats and abuse, they didn’t believe me. They believed him over me and dismissed me, saying that I was delusional and to get off the phone for real emergencies.

I filled out a report for the release of this phone call in 2015. I received the case number, unfortunately I didn’t follow through. Anything related to Dunn makes me sick.

From the time he fled in 2011 to 2014, STILL no one believed me.

In 2014, two special agents from social security knocked on my door. Before they said anything, I asked them if they were here to question me about Dunn, the Sierras and if I knew anything as to their whereabouts.

I gave them so much info as well as where I thought the Sierras were.

ONE OR TWO DAYS LATER, THEY CAME BACK AND CONFIRMED!

The very first thing they said was, “You cracked the case”.

I’m still married to this mother fucker! HE HAS REFUSED TO DIVORCE ME! HOW IS THIS A LEGAL MARRIAGE?!? (I could explain but I’ll do that shit later.)

Robert Dixon Dunn was arrested in 2015. He is up against the death penalty.

I repeat, again: HE IS STILL SITTING IN JAIL AWAITING TRIAL! A cornucopia of cancellations and reschedulings of meetings and trial dates have been involved and he has managed to manipulate the court system to HIS advantage. 

WHY AM I WRITING ABOUT THIS?!?

It’s unfair to the victims (me included) that Robert Dixon Dunn is able to manipulate the system. How does he have a choice in what happens to him when his victims had none?

I need for this information to be shared. I need someone who will care about this case as much as I do. I need support and to not feel like I’m alone. I’m looking for someone who has the ability to actually bring attention to this matter.

With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), online retailers have unlocked new avenues to personalize the shopping experience, optimize sales, and enhance customer satisfaction. Among the most promising applications of AI in this space are AI agents, which are revolutionizing how businesses interact with their customers and manage operations.

This article delves into the ways [AI agents ](https://duanex.com/ai-agents/)are reshaping e-commerce, focusing on three core areas: personalization, product recommendations, and customer service. We’ll explore how these advancements are driving growth, enhancing user experiences, and positioning companies to meet the evolving demands of today’s consumers.

https://preview.redd.it/fgjqazwmi3je1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e3864475bdc492db49e7472302f15c2cf84c6b2

# Understanding Personalization Through AI Agents

Personalization is at the heart of successful e-commerce strategies. AI agents use machine learning algorithms, natural language processing (NLP), and behavioral analytics to tailor experiences based on individual user preferences. Unlike static segmentation methods of the past, AI-driven personalization adapts in real-time, ensuring every interaction feels unique and relevant.

# Data-Driven Insights

AI agents collect and analyze vast amounts of data from various touchpoints, including browsing history, purchase behavior, and even social media interactions. This data enables e-commerce platforms to:

* **Create personalized landing pages:** AI agents can dynamically generate content for users based on their past interactions, increasing the likelihood of conversions.
* **Offer targeted promotions:** Discounts and offers are tailored to individual preferences, maximizing their appeal.

For example, Amazon’s recommendation engine—powered by AI—accounts for up to 35% of its total sales. It’s a testament to how personalization enhances engagement and drives revenue.

# Dynamic Pricing Strategies

AI agents also enable dynamic pricing models, where prices fluctuate based on factors such as demand, competition, and user behavior. This strategy ensures customers feel they are receiving fair value while maximizing profits for businesses.

# Product Recommendations: Beyond Basic Suggestions

Gone are the days of generic product recommendations. Today, AI agents employ sophisticated algorithms like collaborative filtering, content-based filtering, and hybrid models to deliver hyper-relevant suggestions. These systems predict what a customer might want based on their preferences and the behavior of similar users.

# Context-Aware Recommendations

Context-awareness is a game-changer. AI agents analyze:

* **Time of day:** Recommending coffee in the morning or fitness gear in the New Year’s resolution period.
* **Geolocation:** Suggesting winter wear to users in colder climates while promoting beachwear to users in tropical regions.
* **Seasonal trends:** AI agents monitor trends in real-time to recommend products that align with seasonal preferences or current events.

# Visual Search and Recommendation Systems

AI-powered visual search allows users to upload images and find similar products instantly. This feature caters to shoppers who know what they want but struggle to describe it verbally. AI agents further enhance this experience by suggesting complementary products, enabling seamless cross-selling and upselling.

# The Role of Chatbots and Virtual Assistants 

[AI chatbots and virtual assistants ](https://duanex.com/blog/ai-agents-in-customer-support-real-world-use-cases-and-benefits/)have redefined customer service in e-commerce. Available 24/7, these AI agents handle a variety of tasks, such as:

* **Answering FAQs:** Providing instant responses to common queries.
* **Order tracking:** Keeping customers informed about their purchases.
* **Problem resolution:** Assisting with refunds, exchanges, or technical issues.

By reducing the reliance on human agents for repetitive tasks, businesses can allocate resources to more complex customer needs.

# Sentiment Analysis for Better Communication

AI agents equipped with sentiment analysis tools can detect a customer’s emotional state through their text or voice interactions. This capability allows businesses to:

* Escalate issues to human agents when necessary.
* Provide empathetic and contextually appropriate responses.

# Multilingual Support

Global e-commerce requires catering to diverse linguistic audiences. AI agents equipped with NLP capabilities can interact with customers in multiple languages, breaking down communication barriers and broadening market reach.

# AI Beyond the Front End: Operational Efficiencies

AI agents are not just improving customer-facing aspects of e-commerce; they’re also streamlining backend operations. From inventory management to supply chain optimization, AI plays a pivotal role in ensuring businesses run smoothly.

# Inventory Management

AI agents can predict stock requirements based on historical sales data, current trends, and external factors like weather patterns or economic shifts. This reduces instances of overstocking or understocking, saving costs and improving customer satisfaction.

# Fraud Detection

Fraudulent activities are a significant concern for online retailers. AI agents equipped with advanced anomaly detection systems can:

* Identify suspicious transactions.
* Alert administrators in real-time.
* Mitigate risks associated with chargebacks and payment fraud.

# Logistics Optimization

AI-driven route optimization ensures timely deliveries while reducing costs. By analyzing traffic patterns, weather conditions, and delivery schedules, AI agents help logistics teams achieve maximum efficiency.

# Word from Duanex

AI agents are transforming the e-commerce industry, creating highly personalized, efficient, and engaging shopping experiences. By leveraging AI for personalization, product recommendations, and customer service, businesses are not only meeting customer expectations but also driving significant revenue growth.

As[ technology continues to evolve](https://duanex.com/technologies/), the integration of AI agents will become even more sophisticated, offering endless possibilities for innovation. For e-commerce companies, embracing AI is no longer an option—it’s a necessity to stay competitive in a fast-paced, customer-centric market.

Investing in AI agents today ensures a future-proof strategy for tomorrow, where exceptional user experiences translate to unparalleled business success.The e-commerce landscape has undergone a radical transformation over the past decade. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), online retailers have unlocked new avenues to personalize the shopping experience, optimize sales, and enhance customer satisfaction.

But yesterday after a small dinner I tried testing after 1hr, then again after 2hrs. Then late at night I had a treat and did the same, testing 1hr then again 2hrs.

For dinner I peaked after 1hr at 91, then dropped to 88 at 2hrs. But for the treat (glass of milk & small slice of sugary cake), I was at 94 after 1hr & rose to 119 at 2hrs.

This morning for breakfast (eggs, milk coffee, & half a small slice of cake (much less sugar than the previous cake)), I did the same and measured 126 after 1hr, then dropped to 115 at 2hrs.
 
It seems like sometimes I peak at 1hr & sometimes I peak at 2hrs. Idk how to predict when I’ll peak. I don’t want to keep pricking my finger twice after a meal.

I can’t tell if what I’m eating affects it either considering late at night I ate a very sugary cake & peaked at 2hrs, but the next morning  I ate a sugary cake (not as sugary as the first) and peaked even higher but at 1hr.

1ip91zk,https://www.reddit.com/r/bitcoincashSV/comments/1ip91zk/in_proof_of_work_systems_mining_will_always/,"In Proof of Work systems, mining will always centralise regardless of block size","The argument against large block sizes has always been that this will centralise the network and lose the decentralised feature of a blockchain and therefore its security.

However, we can demonstrate that **regardless of block size, Proof of Work mining systems always end up consolidating** into a few large miners dominating the network, thus making “lack of decentralisation” argument against large blocks completely redundant.

To show this i'm going to pick out the largest Proof of Work systems, look at their average block sizes and then see just how “decentralised” these networks are.

**BTC**: Average block size = 2mb. 3 miners control 68% of the hashrate.

https://preview.redd.it/cqm9uvsse3je1.jpg?width=682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=224c7c1e71725943cb55f124feb37470e4a24b59

**Dogecoin:** Average block size = 40kb. 3 miners control 72% of the hashrate.

https://preview.redd.it/80of0f0we3je1.jpg?width=669&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f8a691730574587e573a17289114e37f1619cd1f

**Litecoin:** Average block size = 100kb. 3 miners control 69% of the hashrate.

https://preview.redd.it/o0moap7ye3je1.jpg?width=670&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ebf208839a817ecd4723b0abdc79dbd932c3e5c5

**Monero:** Average block size= 100kb. 3 miners control 67% of the hashrate.

https://preview.redd.it/g3vja9uze3je1.jpg?width=682&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cb86c29f2287e6628b5ceadd7d3747edeb5b2616

We can see that in every single Proof of Work blockchain, even with average block sizes as little as 40-100kb, mining always centralises.

**So why does this consolidation of the network happen regardless of block size?**

The reason is that **Proof of Work mining systems are based on economic competition**. Therefore they perform like a market economy or like any industry in capitalism. In a market economy, competition over time always consolidates into a few big players that dominate.

Think about the supermarket industry, coffee shops, mobile phones. Market factors such as economies of scale always result in a few big players dominating. 3 coffee chains own over 70% of US market share. 3 phone brands own 62% of the worldwide phone market share. 5 grocery retailers control 50% of the US market share.

Proof of work systems **follow the same pattern because its based on the same principles of economic competition**.

Therefore regardless of block size, Proof of Work blockchains will always consolidate and centralise the mining process like a market economy. Just like Satoshi said they would.

Small blocks offer no protection against the centralisation of a Proof of Work blockchain network, meaning there is no justifiable reason why blockchains should not have large blocks.

**TLDR**

The case for small blocks and against large blocks is that large blocks will “centralise the network”.

However we can demonstrate that all Proof of Work blockchains, even those with small blocks, still have the majority of the hashrate controlled by just 3 big miners.

In each of the 4 current largest Proof of Work systems, BTC, Dogecoin, Litecoin, Monero, over 60% of the network is controlled by just 3 miners.

The reason this happens every time, **even when block sizes are small**, is because Proof of Work systems are based on economic competition. And so **mining follows the same pattern of a market economy where industry consolidates into a few big companies**.

This demonstrates that needing small blocks to “prevent centralisation” is false because centralisation will happen inevitably in any Proof of Work system. It also makes the case against big block sizes completely redundant.",1,1739534499.0,bitcoincashSV,1,1.0,False

It’s around 12:45 on a Thursday shift, a former employee walks in with birthday balloons and whatnot, asks who is all on the floor you name 3 servers inside and 1 outside. The former employee requests to be sat in your section, without any hesitation I sat her in my section, I went off to do some side work and left her to chat/mingle with other current colleagues. Went to grab 4 buckets of ice because not one would on the shift was trying to grab ice, cups, glasses, coffee or virtually anything (but no biggie nothing new there) I come out of the kitchen with my 3rd and 4th bucket and another server walks up to me and is telling me, “you take 23 (not my section) and I’m going to take 57 (my section, former employee) to which I replied pretty abrasive/assertively “how are you going to tell me you’re going to take my table? No how are you about to tell me you’re taking my table and not even ask me in the same breath offer me a table that looks… never mind— just take Both of them since you’re telling me what you’re going to do anyway” the other server replied with something of the sorts of “oh former employee said they wanted to sit with me” too which I replied “well if that was the case why when I told her you were here did she not ask to sit in your section?” I didn’t even really give her a chance to respond cause I was so irritated already with the situation? I just went to the back to continue getting more ice and this other server comes in the back BAWLING her eyes out? Saying she would never and has never disrespected me, has never treated me poorly(which is certainly an opinion)— insisted that I was being hostile and aggressive for “no reason” then added that I “was acting like a total bitch” 😭 the server said that another server agreed i was “mean” in my approach which i can only take with a grain of salt as this other server is a very seasoned 60/70 year old breakfast server so thats tells you everything you need To know 😂😂 I couldn’t help but too tell her “I’m sorry she feels so sensitive over the situation but it’s kind of audacious to come up to me TELLING me you’re going to take a table in MY SECTION”— I feel like in most restaurants if a person has a table you want you can uhm— ask? Inquire? Idk?

For further context I clocked at 9:00 I asked another server what could we do to get ourselves close ready (we close at 2) and she said “large expo” which is so painstakingly annoying, tedious and lengthy side work— since it was DEAD AS DOORKNOBS, I took initiative and finished the entire side work before 12– all while I’m doing this side work the girls on the floor were “unknowingly” skipping me lol I didn’t get my first table until the person after ME (the server this dispute is with) got her second table which is already kinda crazy because how do you forget a person is clocked in/on the floor? Is beyond me. My manager said she takes responsibility for that but I just can’t let her take the blame for that, I have been serving for coming up on 10 years I am more than aware when we are being sat out of rotation, and even more so when I’m being sat before/‘ore frequently than someone else? So I was already pretty irritated with being skipped for the first almost 45 minutes of my shift— but I didn’t mention it or want to cause any issues so I swept it under the rug? But coming and literally taking my table = literally taking my money? Especially when we all know how former colleagues tip..

I digress— so flash forward to the end of the shift and we’re all doing side works and what not? (Remember I did an entire side work thinking it would propel us closer to close) I was expected to do front of house closing, (our manager never created a formal side work chart and left it all up to democracy) the other girl was supposed to be back of house— the server that was supposed to do the side work that was suggested to me did the other closers complete side work because she was “so upset?” Or something and didn’t help me with my side work whatsoever even though I did her entire side work willingly of course but I assumed it was with the idea that we were going to be closing as a team opposed to that person not doing their side work at all, and helping/doing the entire side work for the other closer so at the end I said “so I’m front of house closer and doing large expo” to which the other closer said “I was back of house” and I replied “but I literally watched XXXXXX do your entire side work??” She replied something snarky about her having done all the work to which I replied “girl? I literally did half the side work already before you thought about it, brewed coffee grounds for the next open, charged up the coffee pots, etc” to which she said “you literally did one thing? Okay?” Then I rebuttaled with “our manger literally watched me do it this morning but alright” and just stopped cause I really felt like I was going to start responding or acting in a behavior I wouldn’t of been proud of 😂😂 

Just wanted some other servers opinions— obviously I have no remorse for what I would consider sticking up for myself because typically I let people just walk all over me and do/say whatever they want to me and I don’t say anything back but I just couldn’t this time— (maybe my response took her by surprise? I truly don’t understand what crying achieved in that situation/environment?) this other closer works like 1/2/3x a month and whenever she is actually showing up for her shifts she doesn’t like to run food, get ice, do cups, brew coffee or anything she just likes to clock in take a bunch of tables mingle and leave— always trying to skate out without doing things and pretending she is oblivious or didn’t know?? It’s literally the same thing every time with her 😂 I think I just was over it for the last time today… I wonder if I’ll get written up for “making her cry??”

1ip8poo,https://i.redd.it/16118xyed3je1.jpeg,I Finally Found a Middle Eastern Perfume I Actually Like!,"I won’t lie - I’ve been pretty disappointed with my last five Middle Eastern perfume decants. Maybe I set my expectations too high, but some of them just didn’t work for me, even though they’re widely loved. (I'll share quick thoughts on them at the end.)

But this one? it finally broke the streak of disappointments! It’s said to be a clone of Azzaro The Most Wanted but with a sweeter, bubblegummy touch. I’m a huge fan of Most Wanted, and if this one had turned out bad, I would’ve been devastated. Thankfully, it’s  good, close to Most Wanted, just a bit sweeter, with solid projection and decent longevity.

I got my hands on it last week and might let it macerate for a while. If you love Most Wanted or Rasasi Hawas, you can blind buy this without hesitation. The bottle also looks sleek and classy. Definitely worth the price, and I might explore more from this brand. My rating: 8/10.

Now, onto the ones that didn’t work for me - These are widely loved, but for personal reasons, they just didn’t click. I won’t rate them, but I’ll list them in descending order of how much I liked them (best at the top).

1. Afnan 9PM – The only one I might repurchase. Initially, it feels a bit synthetic, but the dry-down has a nice sweet vanilla touch. I get a plum/green apple vibe that stays prominent. Decent longevity.

2. Al Rehab Choco Musk – A chocolate-vanilla gourmand scent. I bought this because I was looking for something similar to Axe Dark Temptation (which I love). Sadly, I still prefer Axe, but this isn’t bad either. Big downside: It left stains on my white Nike t-shirt. I was heartbroken as I don’t even own that many clothes!

3. & 4. Lattafa Khamrah & Khamrah Qahwa – My biggest disappointments of all time. 9/10 people love these, but I absolutely hate them. They hit me like a headache with their overpowering gourmand and cinnamon notes. Khamrah Qahwa is slightly less sweet and has a weird coffee note (definitely not the Starbucks kind). I almost blind-bought a full bottle, and I’m so glad I didn’t. Lesson learned: always test with a decant first!

5. Theoreme – I don’t even know how to describe this one. Pan masala? Synthetic grape? Chemistry lab? Whatever it is, it’s just not pleasant.

If you’re trying out new perfumes, buy decants first! I’m so relieved I didn’t go straight for full bottles, or I’d be sitting here with a bunch of regrets.",13,1739533237.0,DesiFragranceAddicts,9,1.0,False

Alright, founders, grab your coffee, your popcorn, or whatever you need to emotionally process a masterclass in startup hustling. Because this story? It gets so much worse.

For those who missed the first chapter:
	•	I built my SaaS solo for over a year and a half.
	•	Reached out to an old contact for a potential partnership.
	•	He showed up in mentor mode (classic), promising networking, investors, accelerators, startup enlightenment, the secret to eternal success, etc..
	•	Then casually asked for 40% of my company.
	•	When I said no, he generously countered with 36% + a cut of investment.

I should have walked away right there. But no. I had to see where this was going.

Instead of outright laughing in his face, I did something radical: I made a fair counteroffer.
	•	No upfront equity. Because, duh.
	•	Revenue share on clients they bring in. Since, you know, their “network” was supposedly made of gold.
	•	A cut on investment deals they secure. At standard rates, because this isn’t a charity.
	•	Performance-based equity vesting over time. If they actually delivered something meaningful, they could earn up to 20% over three years.

And then… silence.

Absolute. Deafening. Silence.

Not a counteroffer. Not a negotiation. Just radio silence, like I had just unplugged their entire business model.

But before the silence, there was a plot twist.

See, turns out, this wasn’t just one guy trying to hijack my startup. Oh no.

This was a two-for-one special.

Because suddenly, there was another guy.

Someone I had never met. Never spoken to. Didn’t even know existed until mid-negotiation.

And yet, out of nowhere:

“I’m actually working with my partner on this. If we move forward, it’s the two of us.”

Wait. The two of us?

Yes.

I wasn’t just being asked to hand over 36% of my company to a mentor.
I was being asked to hand over 18% each to TWO dudes I barely knew.

This is the moment where I started wondering:
	•	Is there a third guy waiting in the shadows?
	•	Do I get a free espresso machine if I say yes today?
	•	At what point do I unlock the full mafia expansion pack?

And the best part?

The second guy never spoke.

Not a word.

Just sat there like some silent enforcer in a bad mob movie, nodding approvingly while the main guy kept talking like this was totally normal.

At this point, I started pushing back harder.

And that’s when the real tactics started kicking in.

Suddenly, the conversation went from “This is an exciting opportunity” to “You don’t understand how this game works.”
	•	“Your business needs a lot of work to get out there. That’s not your strength.”
Translation: Let me undermine your confidence so you start questioning yourself.
(Never mind the fact that I built this thing solo and actually know my market.)
	•	“This is a pre pre pre-seed company. You need to wear a lot of hats.”
Translation: Give us equity, we’ll ‘help’—but if it fails, that’s still on you.
	•	“The co-founder formula maybe maybe will work.”
Translation: I don’t even believe what I’m saying, but let’s keep this conversation going just in case you break.

At this point, I started realizing—this wasn’t just a bad offer. This was an attempt at psychological manipulation.

They weren’t trying to convince me logically.

They were trying to gaslight me into thinking I was the one being unreasonable.

But the best part? The final act?

When it became clear that I wasn’t caving, that I wasn’t giving up my company for vague promises and startup negging, do you know what I got in response?

Not an explanation.
Not a counteroffer.
Not even a proper exit.

No.

I got two TikTok videos.

Yes.

After weeks of discussion, their grand finale—their final power move—was to send me:
	1.	A TikTok about EBITDA.
	2.	A TikTok about venture capital.

Like some cosmic joke from the universe itself.

After all the grandstanding, all the posturing, all the demands for 36% equity, their final business justification was…
A one-minute stock music animation explaining cash flow.

As if I was going to watch a TikTok on EBITDA and suddenly think,
“Damn, maybe these guys do deserve a third of my company!”

Final Thoughts: The Startup Hustle in Full Display

So let’s review what we learned here today:

✅ If someone demands a massive chunk of your company upfront, it’s because deep down, they know they can’t earn it.
✅ If they bring in a silent sidekick mid-negotiation, you’re not in a business deal—you’re in a Ponzi scheme.
✅ If their final argument is a TikTok, just send them a Cash App request for wasting your time.

Because let’s be real: no legitimate business negotiation ends with unsolicited TikToks.

At this point, my only regret is not recording the whole thing for a case study on startup grifting.

So founders, if you ever find yourself in a room with a “mentor” who wants a third of your company before proving their worth, just remember:

# Bellabeat Smart Water Bottle (2025): Is It *Really* Worth It? Review & Alternatives

Staying hydrated is crucial for overall health and well-being.We all know we *should* drink more water, but often life gets in the way. That's where smart water bottles come in, promising to revolutionize the way we hydrate. The Bellabeat smart water bottle, specifically, has garnered attention for its sleek design and advanced tracking capabilities. But is the Bellabeat hydracoach truly worth the investment? This in-depth review will explore the features, benefits, and potential drawbacks of the Bellabeat smart water bottle (imagining a 2025 version, building upon the previous Spring model). We'll also consider alternatives and help you decide if this connected water bottle is the right choice for your healthy lifestyle.

## What is the Bellabeat Smart Water Bottle?

Bellabeat, known for its focus on women's health and wellness, has previously offered the ""spring"" smart water bottle. For our 2025 iteration, we envision further advancements in technology and design, building upon the functionality of the existing Spring and competitor models. The core concept remains the same: a water bottle equipped with sensors that track your water intake and connect to a smartphone app. The Bellabeat hydration tracker aims to personalize your hydration experience, reminding you to drink throughout the day and providing insights into your drinking habits.

In our hypothetical 2025 model, the Bellabeat hydration app will likely be more integrated within the Bellabeat ecosystem, working seamlessly with other Bellabeat accessories like the Leaf and Time smart jewellery. This enhanced integration would create a more holistic view of your health and wellness.

## How Does the Bellabeat hydracoach Work?

The 2025 bellabeat Hydracoach (a potential name for a more advanced model of the Bellabeat smart water bottle) would likely employ complex sensor technology in the base to accurately measure the amount of water consumed. These sensors would differentiate between drinking and accidental spills to avoid inaccurate logging. This is crucial for maintaining the integrity of the track water consumption data.

Here's a breakdown of how it could work:

*   **Sensors:** Highly sensitive sensors in the base of the bottle measure water level changes as you drink.
*   **Connectivity:** The bottle connects wirelessly (likely via Bluetooth) to the Bellabeat hydration app on your smartphone.
*   **Data Sync:** The app automatically syncs with the bottle to record your water intake throughout the day.
*   **Personalized Goals:** Based on your profile (age, weight, activity level, etc.) and even external factors (weather, location), the app calculates your personalized hydration goals. this builds upon the AI-powered personalization mentioned previously.
*   **Reminders:** The app sends you hydration reminder bottle notifications throughout the day to prompt you to drink.
*   **Progress Tracking:** The app displays your progress towards your hydration goals, showing you how much you've drunk and how much you still need to drink.
*   **Integration:** Integrates with other Bellabeat devices and possibly other health platforms for a comprehensive overview of your well-being. This includes compatibility with the Bellabeat Leaf and any other smart devices within their product range.
*   **Learning Algorithm:** The app learns your habits over time and adjusts your hydration goals and reminders accordingly, making the experience even more personalized.

1. You said so. ""I tried manifesting my sp for 5 months and nothing happened. I decided to give up because it didn't work."" WHO told you that your sp HAS TO COME in exactly 5 months? Maybe they would have come in 6. But you declared that it didn't work.

2. You kept checking the world around you for movement or signs and nothing serious happened. The 3d will never prove what you don't believe in the 4d.

3. You got too many signs/too much movement and kept focusing on that instead of the full manifestation. Do you want the tire or do you want the whole car?

4. You were living in the wrong end. Please be aware that you're always living in the end. It's only up to you which end you're living from. Did you start out with the conviction that you can't manifest because you're not that ""special""? Were you expecting failure for some reason? Were you thinking that your desire is...difficult to manifest? Did you let doubts control you?

5. Directing your affirmations OUTWARD or trying to convince the universe, the world, the air etc. Only direct them inward or else you're giving your power away (aka the forces outside of you might or might not grant your wish).

6. You were living in the desired end for 5 minutes. You can't visualise ""correctly"" then go about your day doubting everything for 23 hours. Manifestation is a lifestyle.

Next up, THE HARSH TRUTH on some ""success stories"": You kept reading success stories that seemed too good to be true and concluded that they're bs. That made you give up, thinking that the law is bs as well.

Imma be honest with you. MY HUMBLE OPINION is that most people FAIL at CONSCIOUS manifestation. Period. Like, 90% percent of people. Which means that a lot of (not all ofc) success stories that you read all over the internet are either wildly embellished, scripting (tagged as success stories aka lying and seeking validation unethically) or downright bullshit (""I manifested unicorns overnight"" - this type of bs is usually found on twitter).

WELCOME TO THE INTERNET ERA. ""Gurus"", 12 yo kids, trolls and mentally ill people (not disrespecting them btw) all have internet access. Take SUCCESS STORIES with a grain of salt PLEASE.

I'm not saying that they're all fake, but PLEASE. Don't rely on them for validation, not even on those that come along with ""proof"" (bank statements, physical changes and mostly everything can be photoshopped these days).

I know that what I've just said might come across as controversial. BUT MOST OF US have had doubts regarding the authenticity of some said succes stories out there. (Not only Reddit, I'm talking about all platforms).

Most people grossly overcomplicate or downright misunderstand the law of assumption, which leads to failure. You don't have to believe everything you read, just like you don't believe that you clicked on an ad and next second, you magically won an iPhone 500.

I believe that ""big"" manifestation success stories exist! It's not different from manifesting a free cup of coffee. It's the same process. God doesn't think in human terms (this one's difficult, this one's easy).

I'm not here to discourage you. But only truth will ever empower you!

Nobody will ever prove anything to you. Go ahead and test it WITH AN OPEN MIND (if you're going to be like ""I knew it wouldn't work""....don't even start anymore).

Prove it to yourself through going all in. There's no shortcuts! No success story, no guru, no method will manifest on your behalf!

I need help on trying to break up with this girl. Basically I met this girl bumble a few weeks ago. Immediately I was not that attracted to her.  But we had a great conversation and I was at least open to trying it out. I now don't believe in things like that. Our first date was drinks at a bar and small games like pool and ping pong.  Our second date was coffee and a restaurant. 

On a second date, I learned a lot of things about her that were turn off. For example she mentioned that she does smoke. She also said that she's Christian but she doesn't believe in the Bible. Lastly she called herself a traditional woman which basically meant that she didn't believe in paying for anything at all Like even if we got married she would never pay for anything for me. So that's when I realized that we don't have much in common. I believe the Bible. I don't smoke. And I do believe men should pay for 1st dates but I personally think that women should cover a man every now and then. 

Lastly she text me good morning every single day and people in my life are getting mad at me because I'm not texting her first. We literally met 3 weeks ago and I never wanted to text her good morning at least until we got closer. On top of that if I do text her she clearly will spend the entire day text me back.  she doesn't have hobbies. So I'm feeling exhausted just being around her.

I am 53, 6'2"" 235, work 12 hours 5 days a week and 10 hours on Sundays.( I work in a lumber mill ). Last time I did any type of workout was around 2008 when I was in the guard. 
Sometimes during work I have a bit of "" downtime"", when nothing is happening. 
Tonight I found these 2 heavy pieces of metal, about 12 inches long, 2 inches wide and 1 inch thick with a bend at one end on each. I'm guessing about 10 lbs each. Heavy, heavy stuff.
I picked them up and swung my arms back as far as they would go, then forward with a "" curl?"" When i got them about level in the front , I  decided to do this rhythmically for about 15 minutes. Back , front, "" curl up"". 

I felt my triceps i guess ? Start to "" burn "" a bit, then it was time to go back to work. Another bit of downtime happened about 20 minutes later, and I did that all again for another 15 minutes.... and when I stopped... it really got to "" burning?"" And I got a shot of energy !! What the heck was that? 

Anyway. It felt good !! I am now wanting to start weight training... not for "" looks"" but for health reasons, as I am getting older. 

I eat healthy because my wife is a diabetic and my son is a vegan. No fried foods, I drink only water and coffee. No alcohol at all, as i can't stand the taste of any of it. No high blood pressure, no high blood sugar. 

Is there a beginner weight training thing for men above 50 that doesn't require going to a gym?

1ip8i9u,https://www.reddit.com/r/datingoverfifty/comments/1ip8i9u/what_valentines_day_really_means/,What Valentine's Day Really Means,"What Valentine's Day Really Means

So today on Valentine's Day I want to talk about what this day means. We have pumped up Valentine's Day into a mass media marketing day. 
A one billion dollar day to ""show"" our love. You must show the one you love, how much you love them on this day. You must take them out, buy them presents, flowers and cards because it is your duty, because it's Valentine's Day.

Here's the thing, do you show your love to that other person for the rest of the year? Do you tell them you love them regularly? Do you do kind things for them throughout the year? Or is it this a one-and-done day and then that's it?

My stepdad didn't believe in all of that, not the flowers or the cards, but he showed he loved my mom in so many other ways. He polished her work shoes every night, he ironed her uniforms and then he went out at 10:30 every night to clean the snow off her car and warm up the car for her before she left for work.

He had her coffee waiting for her, the dishwasher emptied and the kitchen cleaned every morning when she came home from working the night shift at the local dinner. My mom told him she loved him every day, she made sure he had his glass of wine every night at dinner. She worked right beside him on every project they did on our house, that's love, that's what they showed to each other all year long and that showed me what true love was.

Look I am as romantic as the next person, maybe more so, as I am a Libra after all. But believe me, if I could have given back every flower, fancy jewelry, or phony card to have my ex treat me well for the other 363 days a year, instead of just this one day, I would have, in a heartbeat.

Tell me why do we need these ""Days"" to remind us to do something nice? Valentine's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day? Hell, we even have a national ""Eat dinner with your kids"" Day. Do you really need a national day to remind you to do that? That is what is wrong in today's society, it's an all-about-me world, and you don't put someone else's needs before your own. You're so busy doing you, that you need a day to remind yourself to be sweet or kind.

I brought my mom flowers every week, just because I wanted her to know I loved her. Even when I moved 1500 miles away I still had them sent to her every Friday. I gave her and my dad cards all the time just to say I love you and thanks for putting up with me or I miss you when I moved. I give my girls cards just because...I want them to know I love them and how proud I am of them. 

I am constantly calling friends and family telling them I love them and I miss them, I don't need a day to do that, I want them to know it all year long.

Yes, cards and flowers are wonderful on Valentine's Day but if that is the only time you say I love you, then save your money, because it means nothing on this phony day.

So today my friends, take my advice, tell the people that are in your life that you love them, every day not just this day. Send them a card, and drop flowers off on a Thursday. Pick up the phone, call on the way home, and let them know the other 363 days a year that they are important in your life.

And one last thought, for you singles out there, don't be sad that you're single, enjoy your singleness. Buy yourself flowers, go out with friends. Practice self-love on yourself. I go to get a facial or massage, I pamper myself. Don't feel bad that you're single because trust and believe, I can tell you for a fact that not all you see with your married friends is paved with gold.

Be kind to yourself, and do something special with yourself, because you are important as well. Love yourself, love your family and friends, love your life.
You only have one life to make it the best, live large, and love big even if it's just yourself!

Happy Valentine's Day to everyone!
""Be the change you want to see""

Last week me and my husband went out to a show and left my baby for the first time. Me and my mum had done a test run the week before with a fresh pumped milk bottle and she took it happily.
I didn’t have time to pump before we left so took a few bags of milk out of the freezer (maybe 6-8 weeks old). When we got back mum said she refused the bottle. I smelt the milk and it seemed a little funny and tasted weird as well. I’m not sure if it was bad or that I have high lipase? The other bag I then tested was from around the same time but a different day and also smelled and tasted funny. Can high lipase develop over time? I have a fair bit of milk older than those two bags and hoping I don’t have to dump my whole stash.

Anyway the main point for this post was I thought I might try scalding my pumped milk next time but your girl here is lazy and always hoping to find the easy way with as little washing up and thinking as possible haha. Do you think something like this would work to get the milk safely up to temperature? Seems like a metal tumbler but with a heating element that you can choose the specific temperature. Would be so easy if I could just put the milk straight in and leave it. Why doesn’t anyone make portable milk scalders!

a fleeting flame between your father and me,
nights in the city,
the hum of laughter weaving through the air,
the clink of glasses,
the quiet rhythm of us,
side by side on a worn-out couch.

We shared mornings over brunch,
sipping coffee,
talking of dreams and small things,
admiring the endless blue of the beach.
We wandered Port Douglas together,
under sun-drenched skies,
letting the world slow down around us.

He would join me at the theatre,
where music soared and lights danced,
sharing in the magic
that always set my heart alight.
He was vibrant, electric,
charisma spilling like sunlight,
a Bulls cap tilted just so,
a soundtrack of gangsta rap,
Coolio’s words in his ears,
the raw grit of grunge,
Violent Soho’s chords in his chest,
and stories of Melbourne’s underbelly
whispering from pages and podcasts.

He smoked Winnie Classics,
a habit he held without apology,
the sharp scent trailing behind him,
a trace of his presence
that lingered long after he’d gone.

He smelled of Dove’s men’s deodorant,
fresh and familiar,
a quiet part of who he was.
He loved the beauty of soccer,
the precision, the passion,
a game that lit up his world.
And Formula One,
with its speed and thunder,
brought him a joy that never wavered.

With him, I felt special—
space carved just for me,
a soft prioritization
that made me believe
I mattered in his chaotic world.
“Hun,” he’d text me,
or sometimes, “Babe,”
simple words that felt like home.

At night, he would drift into dreams,
podcasts murmuring softly,
filling the silence he avoided.
He kept his home spotless,
floors gleaming, everything in its place,
as though order might quiet the chaos inside.

He dreamed of a penthouse,
the city stretching out beneath him,
a place where life could feel lighter.
He bought lotto tickets regularly,
a ritual of hope,
chasing a luck that always seemed
just out of reach.

He made me smile.
He made me laugh.
He was full of life,
and full of wounds.

A broken boy grown into a man,
with a past heavy as stone.
An absent father,
a stepfather lost to despair,
friends turned into ghosts,
and a marriage that unraveled
like threads of a frayed coat.

He carried it all in silence,
unable to untangle the knots,
so he turned to amber rivers
to drown the noise within.
Carlton Dry became his refuge
when his mind felt unyielding.

And when you came,
brilliant as the morning sun,
he couldn’t stand in your light.
The shadows clung too tight,
and he slipped away.

But know this, Miles:
you are not the reason,
you are never the reason.
His leaving was a battle lost
within himself.

You are my everything,
my brightest star.
His absence carves no hole
too wide for my love to fill.
And as you grow,
we will honor the good,
carry the lessons,
and leave the pain behind.

You are more than his leaving,
you are hope,
you are love.
And you, my son,
will always be enough. ",2,1739532258.0,Poem,0,1.0,False

Dialing in is a whole new journey. I was using an sptk38 and literall everything was between 5 to 8 clicks (with some half clicks).
Here I started at 100 clicks (marked as 10 I guess but there are 10 steps in between each number). I kept same does of 15 gr (which I have at 8 clicks in my old work). Attempt 1 at 150: Chocked! Attempt 2 at 180 very slow; Attempt 3 at 200 I got 28gr out in 40 seconds. It felt a bit too bitter. I guess I will go in 20 intervals. IE. I will do 220 clicks next time. I suppose there is no shortcut for this. The much finer ""resolution"" might take me longer. Any tip? Is there a shortcut for this? Somehow  with the old grinder I felt I got there quicker.

The sofa was facing the wrong way. The flower vase was gone. And there was an extra pillow on my bed. 

I didn’t know if my memory was so good I remembered minute changes like this, before and after sleeping, or if it was so bad I forgot that the sofa had always been facing the other way, the flower vase was never there, and the pillow was always here on my bed. 

I banged my head back on the headboard. I had sworn I wouldn’t fall asleep this time. That I would bust whoever was pranking me. 

Because that was all it could be, right? A prank? The world couldn’t really shift just a little bit, overnight, every night, could it?

But that’s what was happening. Every day when I woke up, things were subtly different from when I’d fallen asleep. Sometimes they were minor, like an extra pillow on my bed. Sometimes I failed a subject I thought I’d passed. 

Once I found I had adopted a dog. A few days later, she disappeared - from my life and from everyone’s memories.

I was afraid to date. Afraid to get attached. Afraid to get pregnant and have kids, just to have it all snatched away in a night.

My friends made fun of my absent-mindedness. If only they knew! If only they remembered!

But no, I was the only one cursed with remembering. 

My head hurt constantly, with the dissonance forced by the changes in my world. My brain couldn’t reconcile the day’s reality with my memories. I went to a psychiatrist once, but I couldn’t bring myself to tell them. They’d just call me crazy and lock me up. 

Somedays, I wasn’t sure if I **wasn’t** crazy. What if I was, and all this was just in my head? What if none of this was real, and I was simply dreaming, strapped to a table in a mental asylum?

I quit my classes. Quit my job. I refused to get out of the house for days on end. 

The world was so pointless! Why should I do anything, achieve anything, if it could just be re-written by whomever was controlling the flow of history?

Which begged the question - who was doing this? And why? What sick pleasure did they get from tormenting me?

I decided I would find them and ask. That was the least they owed me.

But how would I find them?

I couldn’t go to them. So I decided to lure them to me. I wrote a story about how the world shifts when I sleep, and posted it on the internet, on as many sites as I could find.

I doubt they want that going public. 

Within a few seconds, I got a comment - “Take this down.” 

I ignored it. They commented again, unafraid to talk to me publicly. After all, they could simply erase everyone’s memories tomorrow. 

It was one word. A simple word, but it sent chills down my spine.

“Okay.”

And now I wait. I have pepper spray in one hand and coffee in the other.

Tala's bleed is a DoT effect. It will kill, but it takes time. How do we create time? We can hit enemies from long range, and slow them down.  
Since you're Tala, a Prototype should be relatively easy to acquire. This slows down specials. For everything else, an M249 LMG with a 4x scope and compensator is excellent for picking at distant commons and slowing the horde thanks to Suppressing Fire. The bleed will kill them, amped up as much as possible by the damage cards. Bonus points for alternating guns on bulky specials as I believe the slowdown effects stack. Sorry Bruisers.  
Too much horde? Use your copper and utility resources to load up on Razor Wire. Entrench your position and watch them all die effortlessly as they bleed out. Roger's Mansion has never been so easy!

But wait, what if you could spice things up a little and take your Valentine's celebration to a whole new, thrilling level? An unforgettable Valentine’s Day wish while exploring the vast plains of East Africa on a safari! Imagine whispering sweet nothings while giraffes gracefully munch on acacia trees, or sharing a cozy moment under the sun. 

First things first, let’s set the scene. You’re in the heart of the Serengeti, with miles of untouched wilderness stretching in every direction. The sky is a perfect shade of blue, and the air is warm and crisp. Suddenly, a [herd of elephants ambles past your safari vehicle](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/uganda-safaris/), their massive ears flapping ever so gently. Now, wouldn’t this be the perfect moment to wish your partner a happy Valentine’s Day? Picture it: “Happy Valentine’s Day, my love—just like these elephants, you’ll always have my heart, big and strong!” You can’t help but smile as the majestic creatures drift into the distance, leaving you and your partner in a blissful state of wonder.

But let’s not forget the true magic of an African safari is its unpredictability. The two of you could share a morning coffee while perched on a hill overlooking the Maasai Mara. The horizon stretches endlessly, and in the distance, a lone lion lounges in the grass, basking in the warmth of the sun. You could even toss in a playful wink to really make the moment sparkle. After all, when else can you say “I love you” with the [Serengeti’s wild creatures as your backdrop](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/tanzania-safaris/)?

A hot air balloon ride at sunrise over the savannah could also provide an utterly romantic setting for a Valentine’s wish. The world below is bathed in soft pastel hues, and the thrill of soaring high above it all brings a special kind of excitement. As you float gently through the sky, you take your partner’s hand and say, “Happy Valentine’s Day, my darling! Add a little laughter, maybe even a clink of champagne glasses, and you’ll have an experience that’s not only awe-inspiring but delightfully sweet.

If you and your special someone are feeling a bit more adventurous, why not indulge in a sunset game drive? As the sun dips below the horizon, casting a warm, golden glow over the landscape, you could spot [herds of wildebeest grazing or zebras elegantly crossing the plains](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/kenya-safaris/). A little playful banter with the animals around you? It doesn’t get much cuter than that!

For those who are yearning for something truly unique, how about a Valentine’s Day wish over a traditional Maasai dance under the stars? After a day filled with thrilling wildlife sightings, this enchanting evening celebration would create a perfect moment for a heartfelt, whimsical message. As the Maasai sing their songs, you too sing to your significant other. A twirl or two under the night sky could add an extra dash of charm, leaving you both with a memory to cherish forever.

And let’s not forget the picturesque island getaways! If you’re [exploring the stunning beaches](https://www.standardgorillasafaris.com/zanzibar-beach-holidays/) of Zanzibar or the tranquil shores of Lake Victoria, a sunset boat ride would be a dreamy way to share the love. As the evening sun dips below the water’s edge, you could whisper all the sweet words to your partner. The tranquil waters, the sound of gentle waves lapping against the boat, and the cool evening breeze would make for the most serene and heartwarming Valentine’s moment.

Finally, there’s the grand finale: A candlelit dinner in the African wilderness, surrounded by the sounds of the wild. Your elegant table set up under the stars, with a gentle breeze and the occasional distant roar of a lion adding a touch of adventure to the evening. Here, you can give the ultimate Valentine’s Day toast. Add in a little serenade from the local musicians or perhaps a thoughtful gift, maybe a personalized keepsake from the safari, and you’ll have created a perfect Valentine’s Day experience.

My first friends in life all died from bombs when I was 7-9, I've come to terms with the fact that this is just life and we'll all die eventually. We moved to a whole new country, made some friends, then moved again when. I was 12 or 13 when we moved again to the US (can't remember, I cope with bad memories/events by not thinking about them, which causes me to forget and it works).

I'm a 22 years old man now; I'm really good at proffessional/corporate talk, since I've worked as a dispatch, sales/marketing, field service, administration, and business relations since highschool (I did electronics repair on the side in highschool also). The problem is that all I've even known, I noticed that when I talk to people it sounds like I'm reading a resume and subconsciously use corporate buz words and often say things like ""we do"" ""we have"". I've tried making friends many times, and initially everything looks good we talk for many hours, we have fun, and I get ""ghosted""; doesn't matter, women, men, dogs, cats you name it, after we first meet, I send a text to follow up and state how much I enjoyed hanging out, they ignore it and never pick up the phone after. I mean, I know I'm boring, like whose hobbies are cutting keys and welding, that's a job for normal people. (watching anime occasionally doesn't count)

The other day I met some really nice people, we talked for many hours, I expressed we should hangout more, they expressed the feeling was mutual and they'll send me their schedule. I waited a couple of days, didn't receive a text so I sent the following as a follow up:

""I really enjoyed hanging out and talking with you. It felt like I've known you for a long time and were just catching up! Also, I’ve been a little overworking myself, and I noticed I forgot to thank you for the breakfast and coffee, so thank you for that!""

Also send a few pics and details about a topic we spoke about (a project car I've been cutting rust and welding and doing complete drive train swap and rewiring, and a few more things), asked her to show her brother.

It showed as read, it's been a day since I sent that, I don't know what to do, should I send another follow up text to see if they're alright? I don't know if they got busy or I did something wrong (I'm leaning towards me doing something wrong, this is not the first time something like this happens). And just to clarify, no romantic intentions, just a friendship, they're almost the age of my parents. All of the few friends I still have are also older than me.

Doesn't matter what's the age or gender of the peaple I try to form a friendship with, always ends up with me getting ghosted and ive lost count. A few years ago, one of my friends said I'll die alone, this is my biggest fear cause I can visualize it so clearly and it stuck with me.

What am I doing wrong, what should I do differently, and in regards to the most recent interaction, I'm a bit paranoid. Should I call? Send another text? What do normal people do in this situation?

We all have a responsibility to future generations to ensure that our planet remains healthy and habitable. Making sustainable choices and adopting an eco-friendly lifestyle are steps we can take to contribute to a brighter tomorrow. But what does sustainable living look like in practice? 

Here are some practical and manageable tips to help you live more sustainably and reduce your environmental impact:

1. **Reduce, Reuse, Recycle:** The three 'R's of sustainable living are a great place to start. First, reduce your consumption by being more mindful of your purchases. Consider if you really need an item and opt for second-hand goods whenever possible. Reuse what you can, such as shopping bags, food storage containers, or even clothing. And of course, recycle your household waste, learning about what can and can't be recycled in your area.

2. **Energy Saving:** Make some changes around your home to reduce your energy consumption and carbon footprint. A great place to start is by switching to energy-efficient light bulbs, using appliances with the Energy Star label, and turning off lights and electronics when not in use. Embrace natural light and fresh air, and consider investing in renewable energy sources like solar panels.

3. **Water Conservation:** Water is a precious resource, and conserving it is an important part of sustainable living. Install low-flow showerheads and faucets, and try to take shorter showers. Only run the dishwasher and washing machine when they are fully loaded. If you have a garden, use water-efficient irrigation systems and plant native species that require less hydration.

4. **Sustainable Shopping:** The way we shop and the choices we make have a significant environmental impact. Opt for reusable produce bags and avoid single-use plastic bags. Shop at local markets and support farmers who use sustainable farming practices. Choose second-hand and ethically sourced clothing, and consider the sustainability practices of the companies you support. 

5. **Reduce Food Waste:** Plan your meals, create a grocery list, and use leftovers to reduce food waste. Composting is also a great option to consider, as it diverts food scraps from landfills. Start a home compost bin or find a local composting program. You'll be helping to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve soil quality.

6. **Sustainable Transportation:** How we get around has a big impact on the environment. Consider walking, biking, or taking public transportation instead of driving alone in your car. If you need to drive, carpooling and using electric or hybrid vehicles are better options. Plan your trips ahead of time to combine errands and reduce unnecessary outings.

7. **Zero-Waste Lifestyle:** Aiming for a zero-waste lifestyle can greatly reduce the amount of rubbish you produce. Start by refusing single-use items and opting for reusable alternatives instead. Carry a reusable water bottle, coffee mug, and shopping bags with you. Learn how to compost or recycle odd items, like electronics and glassware.

8. **Support Environmental Causes:** Vote with your dollars and support businesses and organizations that share your values and commit to sustainability. Buy from local eco-friendly producers, choose sustainable products, and support environmental initiatives and charities. Your money can make a difference and encourage sustainable practices on a larger scale.

9. **Educate and Advocate:** Stay informed about environmental issues and share your knowledge with others. Educate your friends and family about the importance of sustainable living, and advocate for sustainable practices in your community and workplace. The more people who understand the importance of sustainability, the greater the collective impact.

10. **Start an Eco-Friendly Garden:** Growing your food is a fun and rewarding way to live sustainably. You can create an eco-garden with native plants that attract pollinators and provide habitat for local wildlife. If you don't have yard space, consider container gardening or joining a community garden.

Remember, each of us can make a difference by taking small, manageable steps toward sustainable living. Together, these actions can have a significant impact on the health of our planet. It's an exciting journey, and the rewards are immense!

So, let's embrace sustainable living and work towards a greener and more environmentally friendly future, one small change at a time. Our planet will thank us for it!",1,1739530139.0,sixtyfourAI,0,1.0,False

This was showing in the Fixture results as a GW score of 0, which is out of the ordinary, so if anyone spotted it, hopefully it was obvious that something had gone awry. As a result, I had not included ***JS794*** who survived elimination. Thankfully was easy to correct by replacing one with the other, and pulling in the correct scores.

There was also another manager who was displaying as having a GW Score of 0 and that was ***Justchillin1123***, whom I'd marked as eliminated when they'd survived and been promoted to Division 3. This has also been corrected.

Therefore, my apologies to everyone in Division 3 and 4 as they results you may have seen in the first three matches of Stage 4 would not have been accurate.

***Secondly, there are still places available to fill up the Consolation Cup.***  
Consolation Cup will kick off in GW32, and as it stands, there are 17 spots up for grabs on a first-come first-served basis. If you're interested in an end of season chance at a Cup, send me your FPL ID, either as a comment below, or by chat.

Right, let's crack on with the update. As per usual, all past, and present, Stages can be found in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1949867961).

# Stage 4

# [Tier 1](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=879186598#gid=879186598)

**DIVISION 1**

u/\_13characters leads Division 1 with 3x wins, but it won't be easy to hold onto that mantle if they lose. u/leosondek is their opponent, and the favourite to claim the Stage 4 title, but they are only one of four challengers on 2x wins.

Next up is u/theseane, who plays u/Acrobatic\_Employ\_798 in the final match. For any chance at glory, they need to win and hope that u/leosondek does the same, and then H2H will decide it. Unfortunately for u/Acrobatic\_Employ\_798, the title is out of reach, but survival is key if they wish to put up a strong challenge for Stage 5 and beyond.

Despite sitting in the relegation zone, u/Name19389 has a pretty good chance to win the Stage if u/leosondek and u/theseane both win, as they are they 2x H2H wins they have so far. That would be a pretty epic phoenix-from-the-ashes moment.

u/Fooicus lies at the foot of the table but survival will surely come down to H2H victories against whomever loses in the afore-mentioned fixtures. A win will lift them off the bottom, but other results still need to go their way for survival.

**DIVISION 2**

u/ZAK5UMA is sitting pretty at the top of Division 2x with a 100% win record. However, they are up against u/Andrew643521 in 2nd. If u/Andrew643521 wins, they take the top spot and both are promoted. anything else and u/ZAK5UMA takes all the glory, and H2H will surely play a part for the final promotion spot.

u/StuartA19 is up against u/FanFareApp to mount that challenge. They are the only remaining challenger given a previous H2H victory in GW22. u/FanFareApp looks like they should be safe from Elimination as they only one that can catch them is u/EpiKnightz but they hold the crucial H2H advantage.

u/EpiKnightz only hope for survival is a win, as well as a loss for u/StuartA19. That's what it has come to for u/StuartA19 - A win could mean promotion, and a loss could spell Elimination from FPL Swiss.

u/larsriedel is condemned to Elimination with 4x losses, but could at least jump off the bottom with a win in the final match.

https://preview.redd.it/192854eus2je1.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=9764b798d82fcb710b20997da3f2bf190f6607c8

**DIVISION 3**

u/Dioulio is guaranteed to survive and will play in Division 2 next time around, as they are on 4x wins. The title is not yet secure though, as u/Justchillin1123 can grasp that from them when they go head-to-head in the final match.

A loss for u/Justchillin1123 could be equally damaging, but it depends on whether u/JS794 can win in the final match. The latter has the H2H advantage from DGW24.

As with each Stage, there are some unfortunate souls who must leave us. u/soximent, u/rdtalk and u/Vijaygarv will all depart as they cannot reach the Promotion spots, but they can still play a part in who joins them.

https://preview.redd.it/zcjlkmjws2je1.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=57749c3f3ff08e69e3c3c34197d2350a3e02cb8d

# [Tier 2](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=784690583#gid=784690583)

**DIVISION 1**

u/bb53040, u/sparrowhawk73 and u/coolBballer are all on 3x wins at the top of Tier 2, and they all play individually in the final GW. It gets better - they are all on equal H2H par as they have beaten each other over the past few weeks.

But wait! There's more! Look at those Overall Ranks - all in the Top 50k, and only 20k separating them. With the amount of fluctuations we saw in DGW24, I think we can expect the same for DGW25. I haven't checked if any of these managers, or their opponents, have the AssMan chip in play, or if any have TC still available, but they could prove crucial.

So that should be the end of it, right? Wrong! In the event that all 3x lose, u/Long-Seaworthiness50 will win, by the nature of it all, and then also be on 4x wins. That could be a messy H2H conundrum that I haven't dived into, nor do I want to just yet. The minimum applies - If you win, you have a chance. If you lose, you probably don't.

u/wo27 is desperately aiming to win and stay in the hunt for Stage 5 in the top Division, but it won't be easy.

At the very bottom, u/CardozoSmash is rooted to the spot with 4x losses and cannot move from there, so relegation to Division 2 is guaranteed.

https://preview.redd.it/wuuv410ys2je1.png?width=1906&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b12c6f97a8ad1cbc6a0746490d86fb182c54a81

**DIVISION 2**

u/Vegetable\_Design8330 is on 4x wins at the top of Division 2, and cannot be caught, so they will take the title and earn themselves promotion to Division 1.

u/pa\_ra\_dox leads the way to take the remaining Promotion place, holding a crucial Draw to help their chances. A win is still necessary to guarantee it, and anything less will probably mean they miss out, unless u/NielsRandomShirt v. u/QuantumParadox\_27 finishes in a tie.

At the bottom, seeking to avoid Elimination, is u/FPLExpert needing a win against a Promotion-hopeful. Anything less and it's game over.

u/DrainMember1312 is resigned to Elimination as they cannot escape the bottom two, no matter their efforts.

https://preview.redd.it/3nd9sbnys2je1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=1d228da2ce2dbb5db244607561fe62b32327b28e

**DIVISION 3**

u/FaustRPeggi tops the Division 3 table with 4x wins, and will stay there no matter what. It's a title-win that will go towards their Champions Cup qualification hopes, as well as survival.

u/NoobyDoobyDoooo is a strong favourite to join them, provided they don't lose to u/FinnMundy7 who is waiting in the wings to leapfrog them with a H2H win in the final match.

u/DiamondPalkia can throw a spanner in the works for both but their Overall Rank leaves a lot to be desired. With that in mind, it would take something truly miraculous to survive Elimination.

u/IVIorgz and u/WEAluka are both eliminated, as they cannot catch anyone above them to progress to Stage 5.

https://preview.redd.it/a1dv2i22t2je1.png?width=1904&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdd54d8bdbc1abe3b9df0783924610ab15ad9ef2

# [Tier 3](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/edit?gid=2083037900#gid=2083037900)

**DIVISION 1**

u/thepalegreenpants leads Tier 3 by way of a draw from a previous GW. A win will secure the title, but anything less and u/WaningCynicism will be keen to take advantage, however, it will need to be a win for them also. Both are safe from Relegation.

Neither u/pauld95 nor u/Gloomy-Strawberry808 can take the top spot this time around. However, should u/Gilez\_89 win in the final match, one of them could easily be relegated to Division 2.

u/docvampirina is certain to be relegated, but can jump off the bottom with a final GW win.

https://preview.redd.it/roe0zpy2t2je1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c31721b24587549602a1315a8e9a7e00cd1d34b

**DIVISION 2**

u/\_LilDuck, u/eglantinel, and u/fusrohdab are all on 3x wins going into the final GW. Although it's not yet represented in the table, u/\_LilDuck's wins are all against the bottom three, but they do face off against u/eglantinel in the final match. The winner will be promoted to Division 1, and the loser will be at the behest of u/fusrohdab's result. Although if u/\_LilDuck does lose, that's a step too far given their H2H against u/fusrohdab didn't go their way.

u/Mundanewisdom99 can still throw their hat in the ring with a win, but will need those other results to favour them if they have a chance of Promotion, also. Survival from Elimination is surely the goal though, because if they lose to u/Just7Callum, they swap places.

u/0ng0Gabl0g1an cannot swap places with anyone, no matter how much they wish for it. Elimination is guaranteed.

https://preview.redd.it/ezxy5qq3t2je1.png?width=1894&format=png&auto=webp&s=493cda5553d86ce8f9ba188623d3ed8970bf33e0

**DIVISION 3**

And so we reach the very bottom of the barrel - Tier 3, Division 3.

u/macioman\_00, u/FPL\_06, and u/the\_Vegetabull are all on 3x wins, but there are only two Promotion and Survival spots to fight for. Their collective H2H is all tied, and they all play their own individual matches in the final GW, so it'll likely to come down to Overall Rank if they all win (or all lose).

Should they all lose, u/ShadowGallConcierge will win and make it all the more interesting. That is their only hope, in reality as elimination is kicking the door down while they try to escape through the top window.

u/DasHotShot and u/dedosii are both Eliminated as they cannot climb high enough to escape and survive.

https://preview.redd.it/klxq1be4t2je1.png?width=1892&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc1c3ba298971475d6addbcd4fd5cb6727b75f00

That wraps up the scenarios for Stage 4. Keep your eyes peeled to see how things transpire after GW25 concludes.

# [Champions Cup Qualifiers](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fNW1MRZr7SMG84SAIdcY5tgbXJJ_hFdL8mUODUcjBUU/view?gid=1233273866#gid=1233273866)

You can check out the rankings as things stand over on the spreadsheet (linked on the subtitle, or in the links at the bottom of this post).

As mentioned in previous posts, we are guaranteed to have 32 qualifiers, meaning we will definitely be starting the Champions Cup in GW34. Stage 4 and Stage 5 are the final opportunities to be in with a shout of additional glory. Anyone in the Qualifier table but outside of the Top 32 will be Seeded and ideally receiving a bye in the first round of the Consolation Cup, but that is pending final numbers.

**If you would like to claim one of those places, send me your FPL ID. First-come, first-served.**

As usual, all links can be found below to each Stage and Tier, as well as previous posts.

If I have missed anything, or you've noticed something not quite right with the above, please do let me know as soon as I can as mistakes may not be able to be rectified in an ideal manner, if at all, once the GW starts.

Best of luck to everyone.

just a few hundred hateful messages throughout the day about how shitty I am for “nagging him” (context: I asked him to stop snapping at me yesterday, and this is apparently “nagging”)

He asked me out on a date and I said yes yes yes I would like go somewhere romantic (my last “date” was in December and it was fast food) and he told me that my expectations were too high and go forget about it 

The funny thing is that he’s rich, a dinner date would not put him out AT ALL, but even if her were broke, a picnic or a movie or a walk in a pretty place would be amazing, but I guess I’m not worth it 

Meanwhile, I’ve been hit on pretty much daily this week, idk why, maybe I’m ovulating, but hot guys, everyone is beautiful in their way but I’m talking like guys who could be in the skasgard family, and they’re asking me out for coffee, asking for my Insta, but I’d never cheat and I say no, even though I’m so lonely that I feel like I’m dying 

I’m only 27 and I feel like an old maid… haven’t had sex since last October because he’s never in the mood and even then it was horrible, he didn’t pleasure me, but I took it because it’s the best I can get 

I don’t know why I maintain my physique and dress nice when my own husband won’t even approach me. Well, at least I get some attention from others and that’s better than nothing, fills up that void  

Update is that I’m now getting hammered every day at home, I used to never ever drink but fuck it, what’s the point of trying to be healthy

You think I’m working my ass off in the gym for fun? No it’s more fun to watch vampire movies and drink gin. I work out so that I can have a beautiful body, but no point if my husband can’t tear his  eyes away from pornhub 

I don’t even know what I’m doing anymore, I was an idiot for getting married at 22 and thinking this was a sure way to have a couple of kids before 30 and be a young mum, but I’ll be 28 this year and I’ve heard you need to have sex to get pregnant lol

This is my second drunk post here, sorry for the tmi, but if I had looser morals, I could go to any bar tonight and get any guy I wanted and that’s fact 

The sad thing is that I don’t want marriage and kids anymore, if we divorce I won’t be getting married again, it’s a fucking scam, what’s the point

1ip7tmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/hiddengeneticdiseases/comments/1ip7tmx/anybody_else_have_genetic_diseases_they_never/,Anybody else have genetic diseases they never knew they had till too late?,"I just read an article about chronic disease or illness fakers.  I am thoroughly disgusted that even more people are more ignorant than I thought possible beyond my immediate family.

Right before the age of 40 I passed out waiting for a table at a nice restaurant, slowly drinking a beer. Luckily I had not been a heavy, medium, or even light drinker for almost 10 years.  All I really had physically wrong with me at that time was testosterone therapy, come shoulder surgeries, and chronic,sometimes horrible pain. Oh, I was also told I had a great, really great bronze California tan.

After that incident right before age 40 I had every test I could have done to explain what happened.  Witnesses said, im 6'3 195+ lbs, I just turned white, became instantly soaking  wet, and fell straight backwards like a 2x4.

After all the tests were completed I discovered my Iron(its really called ferratin) was at a level of 3,900 (normal safe levels are 50 to 200 roughly.  I was given a genetic test for hemachromatosis,  which is pretty common, and not a super big deal when treated early.  In fact, anyone with hemachromatosis cam firmly state that we people,all people, black, while, whatever are related.  Black people have a genetic disease called sickle cell disease.  If not treated and allowed to run rampart sickle cell turns into hemachromatosis. Nuff said.

The main treatment for hemachromatosis is bloodletting, the amount of blood you need to get out of your body and how much at a time and how often is usually dictated by the level of your ferritin in your blood at time of diagnosis.  Most people, fortunately,  get detected and treated by 700 to 1500 level of Ferratin.  The body is basically killing itself, ""rusting away"" to say at levels if 1,000 plus of ferritin.

Now five leads later, testosterone implants every 3 months or so, bloodletting (phlebotomy) treatment 4 times a year now ( I started giving over 550 grams of blood 2 times a week for 4 months, and then once a week 4 or 5 months, and so on and on.  I have had a pretty extensive cervical neck surgery, cages, holes drilled in arthritic areas and nerve openings opened up, both hips totally replaced, a knee replacement on left knee coming up soon, always a pain in my ass,, literally,, lol.  There's other things, I have to get liver biopsies every year, heart tests performed every year, no alcohol, low Vtamin C diet, no more liver and onions, and reduced use of cast iron and other high iron cooking and eating utensils.

Thing is,, if you see me just see me, you'll see a big, strong, agile, balanced man.  But what you dont see is how hard it is for me to just get up and drink a cup of coffee some mornings, or how bad both legs ache, hurt, throb, and sometimes especially feel totally exhausted 2 hours after I wake up.  Or a serious neck, nerve issue that I just keep massaging and turning my head.

I don't take opiates, except after surgeries, I can't take much Tylenol or ibuprofen and related.  Mostly ice pack/machine, heat pads, hot hot bath soaks, stretching (carefully), keeping moving, and pushing myself everyday or at least 6 days a week harder than the day before.

I have half siblings, 17+ years older than me, with bone spurs, maybe knee replacement, obesity related issues, lack of movement/ exercise issues, and on and on.

I'd happily trade places with them, but keep my age, and very few people I imagine get what I'm about to say next . I decided after the first 6 months of diagnosis I was going to ""break and fall apart before I rusted and rotted away"".

Do you get that?  Understand ?  I am happy, no I get exited and thrilled inside when I see people with obvious issues, obesity, laziness, bad diet, drinking, etc struggle, not do, or unwilling to do things they should do, much less want to do to make this life more,, make this life better for themselves.  I say F' u all those ignorant dumb lazy scared people that say things, think things, act differently when they interact with you, not knowing you closely and really knowing you, when they see this person that looks, moves, and does lots of physical things better than they can,, and they think your faking or putting on or playing poor pity party me,,, no screw you guys,, try, literally walking 10,000 or more steps in my shoes each day and more, yet sometimes not able to even crawl or move for 2 or 3 hours after 4 or 5 or less some days just living life.

Anyone else have similar stories ? Or experiences?  I still can't get over the fact that had a been a normal,, or whatever you call a person who drinks a six pack a week, alcoholic drinker I would definitely for sure have had cirrhosis or liver cancer by now for sure and probably  be dead.  Anyway,, let me know thanks.

3. Instead of going mosque for taraweeh, I 'pray' in my bedroom but actually practice my yoga stretches on the prayer mat.

I (27M) and my boyfriend (M29) have been togeather for about 7 months now, it all was all great at the beginning like all relationships start, however; it started going down hill from there after, my main concern at the moment is that he is very inconsiderate of my feelings, although he seems genuine while explaining his reasoning for doing what he is doing.

After a big fight with him we met up and talked about him ignoring me and prioritizing his life over our relationship, and we agreed on him putting more effort towards the relationship because I’ve been lifting this relationship all by myself recently, she had a personal trip to get some things done in his hometown so he asked me to come with him to get him company, I was surprised that he actually tried to make an effort and I felt he was actually trying so I agreed on coming with him, after going there and finishing his errands he said something to me out of the blue that really shocked me, he said he wanted to meet up with his long time friend (who happens to be a fuck buddy in the later stages of their relationship) because he misses him as he was his roomate for 6 years  abrod while he was studying for college at the time, and he is now back to his hometown that happens to be the same as my boyfriend’s

I was really confused as why he would bring that up to me in the first place, but I was trying not to make big deals out of everything so I went with it, so we met with him( and something relevant to the story, we live in a very homophobic country where nobody can really be out, so in public he can’t introduce me as his bf, so I was there as his friend) as we sat in the coffee shop they were reminiscing about their roomate days and he randomly touches his arm as he is talking like straight people do lol, but I brushed it off, then; all of the sudden the roomate said that he is visiting my hometown ( where me and my BF live) before going back abroad, my boyfriend immediately offered for him to crash at his house( we live with our parents as it is the norm around here) so basically he is inviting him to sleep over in his room, while i was sitting there, the roomate was trying to eavde the offerr but my BF insisted, I was fuming at that point but lept it inside
We went back and I kept it for myself untill recently I was chatting with my friend and told him about what is bothering me, he said that what he did was very disrespectful of me and he should not have met with him let alone offering for him to crash at his room, I explained to him that he might did it out of generosity ( we say things we don’t mean all the time around here to seem extra generous, you get the idea), but still wasn’t appropriate.

Few days later I told him we needed to talk, we met and I told him about the situation, he laughed and said is that all? ( like it was nothing to be upset about) and preceded with saying: you know I like to keep people I know in my life forever and never cut ties with them, I don’t want to be rude to people and like to keep them as friends.
I told him but it is still disrespectful for me, I never go out with my exes because I respect you as my BF, he said: it is different with you, your Exes mostly started as hookups( which I don’t deny) so you weren’t their friend to begin with. And I know you wouldn’t see them because you all rnded on bad terms.
I said what about your recent Ex ( the last person who was in a relationship with still talks and meet up with him) he said because we were friends first. I was furstrated at this point so I tried to compare and said: what would you do if your ex actually crashed with you and made a pass at you and tried to kiss you, he said he would carefully and gently tell him he isn’t interested and laugh it off, because he doesn’t want to “Disappoint or hurt him ”!!!!  

I really was shocked at that point and said have you thought about how would I feel about this, wouldn’t it hurt my feelings that you let such an opportunity for him to do so in the first place?, he said no because you would trust me if you love me.

I reminded him of how we met in the first place ( he went out with me on few dates then out of the blue he told me he is in a relationship! i know I know I should have never gone through with this but I was really feeling something for him) and told him you aren’t trust worthy to begin with, he said the typical bullshit of :you and I are different, I wasn’t comfortable with him and therefore why I was looking for someone else, he was the first relationship I had and I didn’t know what I was into at the time. 

TLDR, I am currently not comfortable with his dismissive nature of my feelings, and whant to know if his excuses are rational or am I being too sensitve, and try to keep the way our relationship started out of the subject to avoid any chance of bias, I really appreciate everybody’s genuine input at this time.

I am new around and not yet an owner of a framework laptop. I have been a heavy Thinkpad user for the past \~15 years, mostly T series, except for my current X1 Extreme Gen 3. I came across this Framework laptop thanks to a problem I was having with my new thinkpad dock (From this thread [https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/kuim0r/x1\_extreme\_3rd\_gen\_with\_ubuntu\_thunderbolt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad/comments/kuim0r/x1_extreme_3rd_gen_with_ubuntu_thunderbolt/) )

Anyway, I am starting to notice that the amazing Linux support Thinkpads used to have, is kind of fading away... I cannot put my finger on a particular thing, but it does feel that way...

What I am looking for:

\- 100% Linux usage. I use it for working in open source software as my main source of income, so I don't want to deal with hardware not properly working, nor need to keep a Windows partition around to install firmware updates.

\- Good battery life. I work from home, but do move to a coffee shop or a coworking space from time to time, so being able to work at least 4h without having to plug in, is a big benefit. I know getting anywhere near Apple numbers these days is impossible, and we are maybe 2 years away for ARM Snapdragon laptops to be properly working under Linux. Plus, want to know that if I suspend it, I won't need to reload kernel modules or having to restart the machine afterwards because now the trackpad lost the ability to tap to click or bluetooth is no longer connecting...

\- Repairs. Being able to change a disk, a keyboard, an USB port, etc without having to throw the whole laptop away is a huge thing in my opinion. Huge advocate for open hardware, and as far as I know, this machine is as close to that as possible at the moment.

  
I believe you get the idea... I was considering the T14 Gen 6 on AMD for replacing my current X1, until I knew about this... Anyone would like to share your experiences and let me know if I should be switching over? :)

I know there's a big announcement on the 25th, so I will be waiting until then to actually buy it...

1ip7qw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/cheating_stories/comments/1ip7qw5/should_i_be_concerned/,Should I be concerned?,"September of 2024 we lost a very close and very young family member in a car accident. At the visitation two of my husbands co-workers show up, male and female. The male I knew cause at one time I worked at the same place. The female I didn’t. I did get introduced, no big deal. They were showing respect. But, what bothered me I was so upset. My eyes swollen, crying and went off by myself. For a good almost hour my husband stayed with them. I was only bothered because I felt he should be with me, after all we raised this close family member off and on for their entire life. 

Fast forward to yesterday. I was at work and my daughter text me. She lives in the same town where my husband works. While at a local retailer this woman who was at the funeral (whom she didn’t get introduced to and has never met) came up to her and said hi you must be Jane (I’m using a fake name here). My daughter says yes who are you? She says I’m Mary (fake name again). You are Larry’s (fake name once more)daughter? My daughter goes yeeees? This “Mary” says I work with your dad. He’s told me a lot of stories and showed me pictures. I like to give a hard time cause he’s grumpy a lot. It made my daughter a little uncomfortable so that’s why she texted me. It also made me uncomfortable. 

I did confront my husband about it but he claims she comes into the office to “see” another coworker (same one she came to the funeral with). He just joins in on the conversation and the pictures supposedly he showed her pictures that I took. I said so you just randomly showed photos to someone who came in the office to see someone else? I never ask about what “stories” he’s brought up. 

My husband is in his mid 60s and this girl is in her late 30s. Big age difference too. Also I set up family sharing on our phones and the last few days I’ve been unable to see his location on his phone. I always look so I can have his coffee poured and plate ready when he walks in the door. 

I was a little concerned after my daughter confronted me and his location services and family sharing was turned off. My husband is NOT tech savvy and would have no idea how to turn this off. Last night I got up in the middle of the night and turned it back on. I’m thinking of watching his lunch breaks and breaks or to see if he’s even going in but it’s not right to do that? He comes home to me every day on time. I also might add we are really struggling financially and have my mother, oldest daughter and two teens here with us and there is always drama and my husband is very unhappy with our current circumstances. 

So with that being said….should I worry or not? Part of me feels I am the problem cause I might be untrustworthy but my gut…. Says differently. Thanks in advance. ",3,1739529170.0,cheating_stories,3,1.0,False
1ip7q9l,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthProductsNatural/comments/1ip7q9l/i_tried_laughland_teeth_whitening_for_a_week/,I Tried Laughland Teeth Whitening for a Week – Here’s What Really Happened,"Teeth whitening has always seemed like a hassle. I’ve tried different things over the years—whitening strips, charcoal toothpaste, even DIY baking soda methods—but none of them gave me the results I was hoping for. Either they didn’t work at all, or they left my teeth feeling sensitive.

After reading about **Laughland teeth whitening**, I was curious. It’s a **dentist-formulated whitening gel** paired with an **LED mouthpiece**, which supposedly enhances the whitening process. It seemed more advanced than the usual over-the-counter options, so I decided to give it a shot.

Here’s my full experience, from unboxing the kit to my results after six days.

# What’s Inside the Laughland Teeth Whitening Kit?

When my Laughland kit arrived, I was happy to see it was simple and easy to use. Inside the box:

* **Whitening Gel Pens** – These allow for precise application without mess.
* **LED Mouthpiece** – This activates the gel for better, more even whitening.
* **Step-by-Step Instructions** – Simple and clear, with no confusion.

The packaging was sleek, and everything felt well-made. No extra fluff, just the essentials for a straightforward whitening routine.

# How to Use Laughland Teeth Whitening

Each whitening session takes **10 minutes a day**. Here’s how it works:

1. **Brush & Dry Your Teeth** – Dry teeth help the gel stick better.
2. **Apply the Gel** – Use the pen to coat your teeth evenly.
3. **Insert the LED Mouthpiece** – Turn on the light and let it work for 10 minutes.
4. **Rinse & Clean** – When the time is up, rinse your mouth and clean the mouthpiece.

I liked that it wasn’t messy and didn’t take much effort. I usually did it while watching a show, so the time passed quickly.

# My Results After 6 Days

* **Day 1:** No instant changes, but my teeth felt extra clean.
* **Day 3:** I started noticing that the yellowish tint was fading, especially near the edges of my teeth.
* **Day 6:** My teeth were **noticeably whiter—about 6-7 shades brighter**. The results looked natural and even, not streaky or artificial.

One of my biggest concerns going in was **tooth sensitivity**, but I was surprised that I didn’t experience any discomfort at all.

# What Makes Laughland Different?

After trying multiple whitening products before, here’s why **Laughland teeth whitening** stood out:

1. **Dentist-Formulated Gel** – Designed to remove stains without damaging enamel.
2. **LED Light Activation** – Speeds up the whitening process and ensures more even results.
3. **Temperature-Controlled Ingredients** – The gel is stored in a controlled environment, so it stays potent and effective.

# How Laughland Compares to Other Whitening Methods

* **Whitening Strips** – Work, but they can be uneven and often cause sensitivity.
* **Whitening Toothpaste** – Good for maintaining whiteness but doesn’t remove deep stains.
* **Professional Whitening** – Very effective but expensive and can leave teeth feeling sore.

Laughland was **the best balance**—affordable, effective, and no pain.

# FAQs About Laughland Teeth Whitening

1. **Does it damage enamel?** – No, the gel is formulated to be gentle while lifting stains.
2. **Does it work on deep stains?** – Yes, even on older stains from coffee, tea, or wine.
3. **How long do the results last?** – Avoiding staining foods and maintaining oral hygiene helps results last for months.

# Tips for the Best Results

* **Use it daily** – Stick to the full six-day cycle for the best outcome.
* **Avoid staining foods** – Cut back on coffee, tea, and wine while whitening.
* **Maintain oral hygiene** – Brushing and flossing will keep your teeth looking brighter for longer.

# Final Thoughts – Is Laughland Worth It?

For me, **Laughland teeth whitening** worked exactly as promised. It was easy to use, didn’t take much time, and most importantly, **actually delivered results** without any discomfort.

If you’ve been considering teeth whitening but don’t want to deal with high costs or sensitivity, this could be a great option. It’s not as extreme as professional whitening, but after **six days**, I saw a real improvement.

It was filmed as a funny haha video but she literally rammed her uterus into a coffee table as a solution for an unwanted pregnancy. It was honestly sad to watch. 

But of course, she's a parent! And most women I see that make jokes about this and constantly talk about abortion usually have children. Most of the time I will see these women absolutely coddle their young children and talk about how they "" just can't say no to them because they're so precious and I love them more than anything"". I just don't understand how they can talk about beating their hypothetical baby in the womb and then be completely head over heels for their born child saying they would do anything for them. What is the difference between the early stage of development of a HUMAN child, and a toddler? Yes they are out of the womb and much more grown, but they are the same person? They aren't a different species in your uterus?That was the very HUMAN you talk about having the right to murder. Is there something in the birth canal that magically turns them into a living person? 

I'm sorry if this doesn't make sense, and is all over the place, I just want to understand why and how people can think like this. I often can't talk to people about my thoughts on this because just about everyone I know supports abortion very passionately.
