1jt0g89,https://www.reddit.com/r/CharlotteDobreYouTube/comments/1jt0g89/i_had_enough_story_from_20182019/,I had enough (story from 2018-2019),"Enough time has past for me to get this off my chest. This happened in 2018-2019. I have screenshots and videos still. I have not attached them as I have to block out the names etc. There is a lot. The only thing I dont have is the Facebook post, so when I get to it, just know I don't have screenshots. This is a long one. 



So when I was 27 in 2017 I worked at a bakery. I met my  ex friend (f25/26),lets call her Vicki. I thought she was wonderful. We were both Caribbean (Im Hispanic Caribbean and she was African Caribbean) and I felt that we connected. There werent  that many ppl around us in our towns that were from our background. I really loved being around her. In comes her boyfriend (m23/24) he was the same country I am from  so it was nice to be around another Caribbean Latino. We live in the Chicagoland suburbs so most of the Latinos where we are located, are not from the Caribbean islands so it's nice to be around ppl who get your culture once and a while. We will call him Victor. Victor got hired at the bakery because of Vicki. He was hired at the location I was recently transferred to so I was happy to see someone I knew. What I didn't see was the red flags. He is the type of person to scream ""victim"" when he is in the wrong and so was Vicki... I had no idea. So when Victor was claiming some girl was trying to get him fired and lying on him, I believed I him. He was always saying someone did this or someone did that etc. So when he quit a few months in, I believed he was being set up üôÑ he wasn't.

I got a new job and a boyfriend a few, months after he quit (m26/27). We are still together ‚ù§ü§£. Anyways.  We needed a place together. He was not in the best living situation and neither was Victor and Vicki. So we moved into a 2 bedroom apartment. By this time Vicki had a, new bakery job(she was getting paid more than me by a lot...This is important). Victor had a labour job. My boyfriend ""Oscar"" was a music producer at a studio but there was some stuff happening that put his life in danger so he took some time off and was still helping me with our part of the bills (he eventually got a job at a loading & delivering company).

 Everything was fine UNTIL  they started complaining we were in our rooms too much, saying Oscar was leaving the bathroom dirty (he wasn't. It was Victor.. We caught him. He would use it and not flush and then blame Oscar), blaming Oscar for eating all their food (he wasn't. They only ate frozen food. We don't eat that. Im diabetic and Oscar only ate what I bought), Oscar was using Victor's toothpaste (he wasn't. We had our own in our room) etc. This was going on for months. Victor would eat our food and then say Oscar ate his food when Oscar wasn't even home. Victor and Vicki would not do dishes, take out the trash, clean the bathroom, not pay the phone bill (she was on my line due to her falling behind on here because she was paying Victors. I didn't know till after the fact) , not pay the electric bill  and not pay the internet. We agreed to the splitting of everything. It got to the point I had to email her just to get the money. Victor had 4 jobs in 8 months because ""everyone was against him"". They would have money for explicit activities but not for bills. They would scream and agrue at 5 am EVERY MORNING.... EVERY SINGLE MORNING. 

I would ask for the bill money and she would say they are struggling.... Or that Oscar should get a job... Excuse me? He was working... How about Victor? Also you are struggling because you are spending your money on things you don't need instead of bills! 

They would have a space heater running unsupervised. We told them that can cause a fire. They ignored us. This made our electric sky rocket. 

One day I had enough. Talking to them was like talking to a wall. If you said the sky was blue do you agree? Their answer would be "" oh yes I would love fries"". They were driving me nuts. They owed me soo much money over 2k. We moved in 2018 and it was beginning of 2019.  So one day I flipped out. I saw red. It was 5am, they were screaming and I just had enough. Oscar had to pick me up and throw me in our room. 

Later that day Vicki posted on Facebook saying she was the victim... I posted receipts they refused to pay any utility. Her post backfired. 

I am summarizing a lot. But also their relationship was sooo extremely toxic I had to wear headphones to block them out most days. He was always cheating on herwand had jobs disappearing right and left. It was bad. 

Almost all the furniture besides their room, was mine including the utensils, plates, pots, coffee maker and pans.. So we started moving everything into our room. At this point Victor had no job again so he was at home unable to use anything lol because the microwave was mine and in my room. They refused to pay the wi-fi so we changed the password and moved the router in our room. He can sit there. That was not my problem. 

We had to move. My mental health was at stake so we planned our get away. The electric and internet was in mine and Oscar's name. We were the only ones paying so we found an apartment, switched everything to the new place in early 2019. Oscar's friends helped us move when they weren't home.They rented a truck and we have never talked to them again.  


All I know is they aren't together and they got new roommates that from what I was told also moved out due to their behaviour. 


They both tried to befriend me on Facebook around 2021...I blocked them sooo quickly üò≠üò≠

**Part Two**

I watch the clouds rolling in over the ocean in the morning light and absentmindedly grab handfuls of sand and rub them together in my hands until it all falls away. I‚Äôd been tossing in my bed for three hours going from staring at the clock and staring at the ceiling, until I finally had enough and just embraced the restlessness and allowed it to lead me down to the beach. I‚Äôm the only one out here.¬†

This is the only place that feels right to me. I‚Äôve never been able to make sense of it. The feeling of not belonging. It's strong this morning. My position at City Hall starts in a few hours; maybe that‚Äôs it. But there‚Äôs something else. Some feeling I can‚Äôt understand that a part of me is dying this morning.

The weak smell of a smoldering campfire left behind to burn from the night before is carried along by the wind and I close my eyes and pretend that I‚Äôm the last person alive smelling the ruin of everything and everyone I have ever known, and I‚Äôm wondering what comes next. The rain finally stopped yesterday just after dark, but a new storm is on the way. The thunder breaks out somewhere out there over the deep and I grab one last handful of sand, watching it fall from between my fingers. This is life Aaron, there‚Äôs no more to it. Be grateful for what you have. Be grateful that you‚Äôre not behind the wall.

My gaze shifts from the sand to the three scars on my forearm; thin white lines left behind by half hearted attempts at ending my confusion when I was just thirteen. Each one moving closer to my wrist. I couldn‚Äôt make that fourth line. There‚Äôs always been this voice in my head that tells me that my mother needs me. The voice tells me she‚Äôll never know peace if I give up.

I can‚Äôt leave my mother behind.

I rub my hands together and stand up. I roll down my sleeves and take one last look at the ocean. There won‚Äôt be a sunrise today as I had hoped, the new storm has swallowed it, but I‚Äôll be back tomorrow. I‚Äôll weather the storm.

\-

‚ÄúYou look very handsome.‚Äù She says that, but she reaches up and fixes my hair. I‚Äôm almost eighteen but she can‚Äôt help herself. ‚ÄúI‚Äôll never understand how someone as intelligent as you can‚Äôt master the complexities of a comb.‚Äù I love my mother so much that I could never tell her how alien I really feel. I tried once. I was thirteen and the conversation almost broke her. I never brought it up again. She‚Äôs been through enough. I can‚Äôt hurt like my father did. I won‚Äôt.

‚ÄúThank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to do me a favor. I want you to come out on the patio with me before you go.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd rather not.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not a request. Follow me.‚Äù

\-

Our home is the penthouse of the tallest building in the city, it‚Äôs where I was raised. She designed most of the city but that was not her greatest creation. She opens the glass doors and leads me outside. I hate heights. I hate the patio. She knows this and she grabs my hand and walks me to the edge anyway. I want to close my eyes as we get closer and closer to the metal guardrail, but I‚Äôm afraid that I might trip over my own feet and stumble forward. I‚Äôm afraid I might fall over the edge. ‚ÄúDo you have any idea yet as to where they‚Äôre putting you?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. Not at all.‚Äù She places my hand on the rail and my knuckles go white around the cold metal. Now I feel comfortable closing my eyes.

‚ÄúWell everyone has to start somewhere. I‚Äôm sure there will be a small amount of hazing because of who you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôm looking forward to it.‚Äù

‚ÄúAaron‚Ä¶open your eyes honey.‚Äù

‚ÄúMom, can we just go back inside please.‚Äù

‚ÄúAaron, you‚Äôre almost eighteen years old. You're going to have to stop closing your eyes at something you‚Äôre afraid of. Open your eyes. I want you to look at something. There you go. Good. See? It can‚Äôt hurt you. I want you to look down‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúMom‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI want you to look down, don‚Äôt say anything, just look down for one minute. Look at it all.‚Äù¬† I begrudgingly open my eyes and sweep them down over the city. Perfect skyscrapers of glass and steel reaching into the sky. Each one uniquely designed but all are topped with elegant spires, but none reach as high as where I stand. Wide streets down below that have the appearance of a deep dark marble. Statues and columns adorn the smaller stone buildings, and throughout all of it are great trees and small rivers that run through it.¬†

‚ÄúI see it, mom. Can we go back inside?‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is ours, Aaron. It‚Äôs perfect. I‚Äôm proud that you‚Äôre about to take part in it. I‚Äôm proud of you. A young man of Consensus. Someday, you‚Äôre going to lead all of this. I promise you.‚Äù

\-

The small tram leaves the city and shakes and shudders up the winding green hills on the long road to City Hall. Other technicians are all dressed in suits and ties and their bodies all move in unison with the bumps in the road. I‚Äôm the only one standing; the only one who didn‚Äôt have a seat. Most of the other men and women are staring out of the windows at yet another storm on the horizon, but a couple of them are staring straight at me and I‚Äôm keeping my eyes down pretending that I don‚Äôt notice.¬†

When the tram finally tops the hill, I see City Hall. A concrete building with four pillars in front. It was specifically designed to resemble nothing in the city below; beautiful in its own right, but far more simple. Hard angles without a hint of elegance anywhere in its design and the cold cracked stone steps that lead up to the doors leave an impression that you‚Äôre walking up to a place that is different from anything you‚Äôve ever known.

We all exit the tram as it comes to a stop, and I walk behind the rest of the technicians. The entire facade above the steps is glass and reflects the green hills, the ocean, and the skyscrapers of the city below. My mother had told me that when she designed it, she wanted the people who were about to enter the doors to remember what they were laboring for. A perfect society.

The perfection reflected in the glass isn‚Äôt quite so pleasant this morning. Everything is loomed over by the dark clouds and the quick bursts of lightning inside of them. Two large men dressed in bright white robes stand guard on either side of the entrance. Bishops. The human side of physical control over the people behind the wall. Their eyes stare straight ahead and never move on any of the technicians walking past them.¬†



The inside of the building is far more pleasant than the outside. Wooden walls and an arched ceiling above while the floors are black and white marble squares. A chess board. My mother did not push me to study architecture, but she did insist on me learning her other passion. She‚Äôs never said anything to me about her choice in the design of the floor, but she doesn‚Äôt have to. Blatant symbolism is everything to my mother, subtlety has never been her strong point.

We are all here to play a game, and it's imperative that we are always several moves ahead.

Tall wooden doors run on either side of the great hall, and while the walls lean toward the look of a redwood, the doors are a deep mahogany with ornate oversized brass handles.

I have no idea where to go. I was told I would be met by a trainer just inside the front doors, but I watch all of the technicians disappear into their various departments and I‚Äôm left alone inside the hall. I take a few steps forward and my footsteps echo down through the hall. I feel stupid just standing here and I begin to wonder which door I should poke my head into first when one of them opens.

I see Tommy smiling back at me. Tall and thin like me, but his blonde hair is perfectly placed and his strong jaw looks out of place with the rest of his delicate features. He puts his finger to his lips, telling me to be quiet as he walks forward in his pressed black suit. Seeing him is the first bright spot of my day so far. I walk to him and both of us look up and down the hall to see if anyone else is there. Once we‚Äôre both satisfied that we‚Äôre alone, he wraps his arms around me and squeezes the life out of me.

‚ÄúLook at you, standing there like an idiot!‚Äù He whispers into my ear.

‚ÄúYou did this, didn‚Äôt you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to let someone else show my little brother to his department.‚Äù He rubs his knuckles into the top of my head and messes up my hair as he lets me go. I don‚Äôt really remember a time when he didn‚Äôt refer to me as his little brother. Tommy was my father‚Äôs student and eventually, his protege. After my father died when I was five, he took it upon himself to be a stand in for me. He felt that he owed it to my father, and even though Tommy is nineteen years older than me, he‚Äôs never talked down to me, nor did he let me get away with anything. I could always talk to Tommy about everything. ‚ÄúNervous?‚Äù

‚ÄúI was starting to get a little worried that I was forgotten.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, I wouldn‚Äôt let that happen.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah, I‚Äôm a little nervous. I have no idea what I‚Äôm even doing.‚Äù

‚ÄúYeah‚Ä¶ I saw that you let the program choose your station. You haven‚Äôt looked at it yet?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not thrilled about where you were placed, but you insisted. You're stuck now for six months until you can transfer to somewhere else. Unless, of course, you let me fix that for you‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. No special treatment.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm proud of you.‚Äù

‚ÄúThanks, Tommy.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt call me Tommy here. While we‚Äôre here you‚Äôve got to call me Thomas. No special treatment. Come on. I‚Äôll show you where you‚Äôre going. Fix your hair, you‚Äôre embarrassing me.‚Äù He smiles and I walk down the hall next to him. ‚ÄúNow, I‚Äôm not going to walk in there with you because they‚Äôre already going to give you enough shit without me being there. Are you sure you want to do it this way?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sure.‚Äù

‚ÄúBecause if you change your mind, I can just train you myself. Nepotism be damned.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I can‚Äôt do that.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhatever. I had to try one last time. Alright.‚Äù He walks up to a door that has an XLIX carved into the wooden trim above it. ‚ÄúHere you are. Before you go in there, I want you to hear something.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, I‚Äôm going to speak not as your brother, but honestly as the person who runs Consensus for The Founders. I am very happy to have you here. I think you are going to do very well and I think you will eventually take my place someday. Aaron, you‚Äôre that promising and I know that you struggle, but you‚Äôre worth a lot more than you think you are.‚Äù

‚Äú...Thanks‚Ä¶‚Äù I can‚Äôt look at him. He‚Äôs the only person who has ever seen the scars on my arm. He‚Äôs the only person I have ever told how close I was to ending everything. He just stares at me and all I can do is come up with a smart ass comment.

‚ÄúWhat‚Ä¶ Do you want a kiss or something?‚Äù He laughs and squeezes my shoulder.

‚ÄúGo get ‚Äòem. And when your first shift is over, I‚Äôve got a surprise for you back home. You‚Äôre going to love it. Good luck.‚Äù He slaps his hands on the sides of my face and presses his slobbery lips to my forehead. I push him off of me and wipe my face. He laughs as he walks back toward the main control room and I take a deep breath and open the door in front of me.

\-

One man is standing inside while everyone else is seated. He waddles over and puts out his sweaty hand.

‚ÄúAaron. Welcome to room Forty Nine. My name is Norman. Follow me.‚Äù

‚ÄúThank you, sir.‚Äù He weaves back and forth as his distended stomach shifts his weight with each step and he scratches at his balding head with a ravenous intent, as if something is buried just under the skin.¬†

‚ÄúOh, you don‚Äôt have to call me sir. This can be one of the more stressful departments so we try and keep everything as upbeat as we can. In fact, we do our best to find the joy in our work and make a game of it. Kind of keeping spirits up.‚Äù¬†

Almost a hundred people are crammed inside in small cubed workspaces; a monitor and keyboard are in front of every one of them. They all wear earpieces and are focused intently on what they‚Äôre doing except one person who has looked up as I pass by. It's one of the people who was staring at me while I was on the tram. His portly face pushes in on his features, pursing his lips and narrowing his eyes into what I assume is a permanent look of skepticism.

‚ÄúIt's very loud in here.‚Äù Almost everyone is talking into their headsets. They all speak in the same droning cadence.

‚ÄúOh yeah. All the microphones on the headsets are individualised, so the only sound the program picks up is the sound of the operator themselves. The earpieces cancel out most of the sound so operators can concentrate on what‚Äôs being said and not the conversations of their teammates. We‚Äôre all teammates here. Every department will tell you they have the best team, but our department is always one of the most productive. Here. This is a perfect example of what I mean about making this function a little more tolerable.‚Äù He points to the digital board in the front of the room. It displays all kinds of information on various policies of the department, but right in the middle are about ten names with numbers next to them. ‚ÄúThe leaderboard of the month. Every month we see who gets the highest reduction rate.‚Äù

‚ÄúReduction rate?‚Äù

‚ÄúExactly. Simon is usually the one who always runs away with it. He‚Äôs got a special strategy that‚Äôs kind of a grey area.¬† He‚Äôs already got a hundred and thirty seven this month. I‚Äôll have you training with him today.‚Äù

‚ÄúUm‚Ä¶ sir, what job do we actually do here?‚Äù

‚ÄúWe facilitate reductions. Decrease the non productive surplus. Didn‚Äôt you‚Ä¶ look at your assignment?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo. I just assumed the program put me wherever it thought I could be of the best use.‚Äù

‚ÄúI saw that. It‚Äôs rare to have someone who didn‚Äôt even type in preferences of where they wanted to be placed. But I‚Äôve never even heard of someone not looking at what department the program chose for them.¬† By the way, it‚Äôs probably best from now on if you get into the habit of using the word ‚ÄúConsensus‚Äù when you‚Äôre referring to the program. We‚Äôve had instances where some operators use the wrong verbiage and all it does is confuse the chattel. To them it's not a program. It‚Äôs more than that. It‚Äôs more of an all knowing deity; can't afford to have any weakness or doubts in that perception.‚Äù

‚ÄúUnderstood.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk, well apparently Consensus thought with your test results that you would be best suited to work in suicides.‚Äù

‚ÄúSuicides?‚Äù My heart starts to race. I can feel my scalp starting to sweat.

‚ÄúIn this department, we facilitate reductions. Specifically non productive chattel. Strictly speaking, the population inside the wall works in much the same way a normal person would. Which is to say, that a chattel contemplating suicide becomes so preoccupied, it renders itself useless. Now the program‚Ä¶ see? I just did it myself. ‚ÄúConsensus‚Äù will run exactly two automated sessions with chattel in order to increase productivity and try and fix the problem, but if it comes up a third time, Consensus will automatically reroute the session here.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand. Why?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe machine isn‚Äôt exactly creative when it comes to persuasion in those instances. After a third period of the chattel expressing suicidal thoughts, statiscally, there‚Äôs no more use in trying to save the individual. It‚Äôs damaged beyond repair. What we do here is convince them to end their lives through whatever means necessary. Would you like a pastry?‚Äù He motions at a table full of food and two coffee machines.

‚Äú...No thank you‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúAnyway, it‚Äôs much easier than sending a Bishop or a group of Clerks to terminate the chattel. Now if we can‚Äôt do our job, then we send it up the chain and ultimately a Bishop will handle it, but that might take the Bishop away from more crucial functions. Our job is to keep things easy and mess free and as streamlined as possible. Pretty simple.‚Äù¬† He gives me a friendly smile and then I watch him mercilessly tear into a cheese and cherry pastry. Some of it falls on his shirt. I made a mistake. My scalp feels soaked under my hair and I feel a single bead of sweat tumble down my left temple. The scars on my arm begin to itch. Norman devours the pastry with his mouth open and he points back toward the door.

‚ÄúYou have to remember, most of their brain functions are very similar to ours. Millions of them are enclosed by the wall.. It‚Äôs only natural that a lot of them will start to go a little crazy and need to be removed. Alright. Let me get you with Simon. I‚Äôm also going to get a headset ready for you in a little bit. Now all I‚Äôm going to have you do today is watch Simon. Ok?‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

As we walk to the back of the room I start getting even more nervous. It looks like he‚Äôs moving toward the man with the beady eyes who stared at me on the tram.¬†

Shit.

‚ÄúSimon? This is Aaron. Alright. You two have fun. Aaron, lunch is at two o'clock and it lasts an hour. Good luck.‚Äù

Norman waddles away and Simon stares at me without saying a word.

‚ÄúHello.‚Äù

Still nothing. He uses his leg to pull a second chair away from his desk and then looks back at his monitor. I sit down and just watch. There are several tiles on his screen that show video feeds from behind the wall. The rank streets and ugly buildings of¬† low station neighborhoods. Another tile shows a moving list of names and ages with percentages next to them. After watching him silently for almost an hour, I finally say something.

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs that scrolling list for?‚Äù

‚ÄúProbabilities.‚Äù

‚ÄúFor what?‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt even look at me. He runs his finger from one side of his throat to the other and makes a squishy cutting sound. A slight bit of spittle flies onto his monitor, but he doesn‚Äôt wipe it off. I watch it roll down the screen.

\-

Another hour and nothing. I hear the voices of the other workers. They‚Äôre all speaking to people behind the wall. People who think they‚Äôre speaking to an all-knowing Artificial Intelligence that rules their lives. The people in Department 49 are saying some of the cruelest things I‚Äôve ever heard to desperate people looking for help.¬†

No. Not people.¬†

Chattel.¬†

Focus Aaron.

I watch Simon do nothing until lunch, and then, I watch him eat about three times as much as I do until I can‚Äôt stand the silence any longer. Our table is the only one that‚Äôs been silent in the cafeteria.

‚ÄúSo‚Ä¶ how are you the most productive worker when all you‚Äôve done for the first half of the day is look at your screen?‚Äù His beady eyes bore into me after I ask the question.

‚ÄúI know who you are, kid. I looked up your information after your assignment was posted.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo your dad was the main brain behind the Consensus Program and you‚Äôre asking me how things work?‚Äù

‚ÄúHe died when I was five.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo he never talked to you about any of it?‚Äù He‚Äôs not even trying to hide the contempt in his voice. He takes his tongue and uses it to knock loose a stringy bit of sausage stuck between his teeth.

‚ÄúI was five.‚Äù

‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôll tell you. I‚Äôve been collecting data. Saving the information on the poor Simps I‚Äôm going to be retiring today.‚Äù Simps. The vulgar way of referring to the chattel. If I had ever used that word around my mother, she would have slapped me. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing and that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm the most productive person in the department.‚Äù

‚ÄúNorman told me that the calls were routed by the system.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey are. There are millions of male and female Simps inside that wall. Millions. Everyday a lot of them finally get wise to how fucking awful their lives are and they just need a little push to end them. Easy job. Most of those people are younger. They take a little more time to convince. I‚Äôll take those calls after lunch, but I‚Äôll also make a lot of my own. That‚Äôs the data I‚Äôve been collecting all morning.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do you mean, a lot of your own?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt mind telling you how I do it, because no one else has the knack that I do when it comes to the old Simps.‚Äù He waits for me to say something.

‚ÄúUm.. what‚Ä¶ old..chattel.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre Simps, kid. You can clean it up all you want, but if you keep up that kind of pleasantry in this job, you‚Äôre not going to last long. Old Simps. Males and females that aren‚Äôt quite to the Age of Exit. You know what the Age of Exit for a Simp is, right?‚Äù

‚ÄúI do.‚Äù

‚ÄúSo the ones I‚Äôm talking about have fallen below fifty percent productivity in their stations. Once they fall below that, they‚Äôre fair game. That‚Äôs where I come in. Sure, I‚Äôll take the routed calls, but where I really make up the numbers is convincing the old Simps to retire themselves. They‚Äôre worn down, on the verge of giving up. They don‚Äôt have that spark that comes with youth. Easy prey. Plus‚Ä¶ most of them remember what life was like before the wall. That makes them beyond ripe. Most of the Simps in there now were either children when they went in or were born inside. They don‚Äôt know a whole lot different. But the older ones? They have to live with the thought that they put themselves in there willingly. All I do is remind them of that in a certain way, and five minutes later, I‚Äôve got a Simp bleeding out in their own bathtub.‚Äù

¬†He leans back from the table and crosses his arms as if he‚Äôs just told me the secret to life itself. Miniscule gobs of potato salad fall from his beard as his smile grows from ear to ear.

‚ÄúThat‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs clever.‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt suggest you try it. Like I said, I‚Äôm very good with the old ones and no one else quite has the knack. You‚Äôve got to be real subtle when you push depression from nostalgia. If you do it wrong, you give them hope, and then you‚Äôve wasted time on one when you could have put down two others in the same amount of time. They‚Äôve got to believe it's their idea. I practiced for a few years before I got it down. You want to watch the magic?‚Äù I nod my head, but I really don‚Äôt. I don‚Äôt like this man.

\-

I watch him go from one call to the next. I hear his unpleasant voice mocking them, but the people talking to their terminals behind the wall only hear the soothing voice of Consensus convincing them that there is no more reason to go on with their lives. The things he says, the words he uses‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve never wanted to hit someone so much in my life. Every time he convinces someone to take their own life, he claps his hands together.¬†

The efficiency of his work is impressive. A vicious predator who knows just the right words to say to his prey. Physically, I‚Äôm staring at a short man almost four times as wide as I am with flecks of lunch in his beard and short wiry hairs exploding from each nostril. But if I close my eyes, I‚Äôm listening to a master of verbal manipulation the likes of which I‚Äôve never encountered.

I watch him go on for hours until I think it can‚Äôt get any harder to listen to and then Norman brings me my own headset and I‚Äôm jacked into the system, finally hearing the other side of the conversations. The pleading voices of the young and old, more than half actually thank Consensus for helping them make the decision to take their own lives. Each time someone says, ‚ÄúPraise Consensus‚Äù Simon claps his hands twice and everyone at every desk mutes their microphones and shouts, ‚ÄúAmen.‚Äù Norman just chuckles. I guess it's another little game they play to keep their spirits up.

\-

At the end of the shift, Simon takes off his headset and stands up on numb legs and keeps his balance by holding on to the desk.

‚ÄúEverybody! It‚Äôs time!‚Äù

I‚Äôm so happy it's time to leave. I start to stand up and Simon puts his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúWait! We‚Äôre not finished yet.‚Äù He pushes me back down into the chair and motions for me to put my headset back on. All of the other workers hang their headsets from their necks and walk over to Simon‚Äôs desk. All their eyes are on me. Norman toddles over and puts his hand on my shoulder.

‚ÄúHow are you feeling about today, Aaron?‚Äù He has a huge smile and I‚Äôm getting really uncomfortable with everyone in the room staring at me.

‚ÄúOk, I guess.‚Äù

‚ÄúGood. We have a little tradition here. On everyone's first day, they get to do one reduction before the night crew takes over.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh, that‚Äôs ok. Honestly, it‚Äôs a lot to remember and I still don‚Äôt know how to work the terminal properly.‚Äù

‚ÄúOh that‚Äôs not a problem. Simon can work the terminal, all you have to do is talk. Work your magic.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôd really rather not.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôm afraid it‚Äôs non-negotiable young man.‚Äù Norman can‚Äôt stop smiling along with everyone else like this is some kind of joke, but Simon just stares at me with those tiny eyes.

‚ÄúUnless you wanna go cry to your big brother or your mommy. I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd come running to help you.‚Äù I hate him and he can tell. That fucking smile creeps over his face because he knows that he‚Äôs got to me. Before I can say anything, Norman plays the peacekeeper.

‚ÄúOh come on Simon. You need to take it easy on him. It‚Äôs his first day.‚Äù

‚ÄúCome on, kid. Don‚Äôt be a coward.‚Äù Simon and I are staring at each other. Part of me wants to just walk out. Simon‚Äôs right. If I wanted to walk out, I could. I‚Äôve been protected in the shadows of important people my whole life. I won‚Äôt call for help this time. All the horrible things I‚Äôve listened to for the last four hours are out of my mind, and all that remains is putting this awful disgusting person in his place.

‚ÄúAlright. Find me someone.‚Äù Everyone cheers and Simon sneers at me.

‚ÄúThe record for a new technician is three minutes and twenty seven seconds. That‚Äôs my record.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can do better than that.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúThe fuck you can.‚Äù Simon goes to work on the keyboard. ‚ÄúOk. I‚Äôve got a guy coming on in ten seconds who has been waiting to talk to Consensus for over four minutes. He‚Äôs¬† a twenty two year old doctor named Shawn. Interfacing on the terminal in his thirty fourth floor apartment. He‚Äôs said twice that he has cut himself and he has considered opening his wrists.‚Äù

I want to throw up. Everyone is watching me. I can‚Äôt fail. I have to do this. I have to honor my mother. I have to honor Tommy. I have to beat this disgusting piece of shit and his record. My left hand automatically rubs my right forearm and I can feel the raised scars underneath my shirt.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be looking up more data. Watch the screen while you talk.‚Äù Simon counts down on his fingers.

Five¬†

‚ÄúHello Shawn. I am so very sorry that I had to put you on hold. More important things to attend to, but now I‚Äôm all yours. Please continue with what you were saying.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright‚Ä¶so like I was saying. I‚Äôm having those thoughts again and this time theyre not going away.‚Äù His voice is breaking.

‚ÄúI see.‚Äù I don‚Äôt say anything more. I think of what would have driven me over the edge all those years ago. A long silence from an ambivalent and disinterested friend. I remember imagining how that would feel when I was thirteen, and now I‚Äôm hearing the effects of it for real.¬†

¬†‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just that‚Ä¶‚Äù He starts crying. Norman is giving me two thumbs up in the air and whispering that I‚Äôm doing great.Everyone else has an expression of excitement. ‚ÄúI feel like there should be more.‚Äù

‚ÄúMore? What do you mean?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm very happy with my station. I‚Äôm very happy with my work. It just‚Ä¶ this can‚Äôt be it. Can it?‚Äù

‚ÄúI don‚Äôt follow you, Shawn.‚Äù

‚ÄúTo life. This can‚Äôt be all there is.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you not happy with the life you‚Äôve been provided?‚Äù My voice goes cold.¬†

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs not it. I can‚Äôt explain it. Please tell me how I can make this go away.‚Äù

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt do that for you anymore Shawn.‚Äù I instinctively cover the microphone as Simon yells at me.

‚ÄúTell him to jump out of the window!‚Äù Everyone cheers in agreement. I barely hear Shawn through the earpieces.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúWhat do you expect from me Shawn? I‚Äôm not a magician. Do you know what that is?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúA magician. One who performs magic. You don‚Äôt have a damn clue what I‚Äôm talking about.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúYou are ungrateful Shawn. You don‚Äôt deserve life.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúThe rest of the city is very grateful. Did you know that you‚Äôre the only one who feels this way? You, out of millions, are the problem Shawn.‚Äù My voice is taking on a life of its own. It‚Äôs like the terrible inner voices that used to plague me are now being released on this poor man.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúI think you should do it. Take the plunge as it were.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù Simon points to the screen. He has a countdown going. He‚Äôs timing me. I only have thirty seconds left. I have to think of something else. I have to scare him into jumping out of his window. Think!

‚ÄúDo it Shawn. Save both of us the trouble of anymore of these conversations.‚Äù

‚ÄúWait‚Ä¶‚Äù I get an idea and I cut him off.

‚ÄúNO! DO IT! Shawn, I‚Äôve got someone on the way. You have two choices. Do it yourself, or he can make an example out of you.‚Äù Everyone in the room cheers at my new approach while Shawn pleads through the headset. Simon‚Äôs fingers are flying all over his keyboard and a new tile pops up on his screen. It's a video feed from the monitoring station across the street from Shawn‚Äôs apartment. It pans up and zooms in on a window on the thirty fourth floor of an ugly concrete building.

‚ÄúPlease‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThrow yourself out of the window Shawn. Humble yourself.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm feeling better. Thank you.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry Shawn. Maybe I‚Äôm not making myself clear. Throw yourself out of the window. Its the only way you‚Äôre ever going to be free.‚Äù

‚ÄúNo.‚Äù

‚ÄúAre you telling me no?‚Äù

‚ÄúI apologize‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúThen just sit there Shawn. Someone will be along soon. But it won‚Äôt be as fast as the fall. It‚Äôs going to take a while. He does his work nice and slow.‚Äù¬†

‚ÄúOk‚Ä¶ok‚Ä¶ please‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt want to be an example.‚Äù

‚ÄúThen do it.‚Äù

‚Äú‚Ä¶ok‚Ä¶‚Äù I hear him stand up and I see him looking out of his window on Simon‚Äôs screen. I only have ten seconds left on the countdown.

‚ÄúSay it with me Shawn. Humble yourself‚Ä¶ There is no one first..‚Äù

:09

‚Äú... We are all together or we are nothing at all.‚Äù

:08

‚ÄúConsensus be with you Shawn.‚Äù

:07

‚ÄúAnd also with you‚Ä¶‚Äù

:06

Everyone cheers as we watch Shawn run through the window. The camera pulls back and I watch him fall.

Down.

Down.

Down.

What have I done?

He‚Äôs falling towards a crowd of people under umbrellas walking in a single file line. He‚Äôs going to hit some of them. I close my eyes before he hits the crowd and the ground and everyone cheers but Norman, who puts his hand to his mouth and says, ‚ÄúOh, shit!‚Äù

I feel acid coming up my throat and I press my lips together. Something warm and sour floods into my mouth and I fight the instinct to open wide and spit it out. I swallow it back down and my head spins as I open my eyes.

The rest of the room is cheering and saying my name. Norman is tapping his finger against the screen and counting the other people that Shawn took out before his body hit the pavement. He shakes his head and keeps going on and on about collateral damage. Simon just stares at me.

‚ÄúYou broke my record and you couldn‚Äôt even watch til the end, huh?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúShut up, kid.‚Äù

‚ÄúAlright, everyone!‚Äù Norman waves his hands. ‚ÄúShifts over! Before we start tomorrow, I want to go over again how important it is to isolate the reduction. We might all be proud of Aaron‚Äôs efficiency and creativity, but we just lost three productive chattel and a five year old that was designated to be a Bishop. Isolate, isolate, isolate! Goodnight everyone!‚Äù Norman turns to me.

‚ÄúAaron. That was very good. Unfortunately, Simon‚Äôs direction about reduction through a fall will ultimately cost a lot of productivity down the road. We‚Äôll talk more about it tomorrow. Simon. My desk. Now!‚Äù

Everyone files out of Department 49, while Simon follows Norman to the front of the room. I‚Äôm staring at the video tile on the screen. The people have dropped their umbrellas and are watching a man giving chest compressions to a broken five year old boy who is bleeding out.

\-

I throw myself through the bathroom door. No one is in here. I barely make it to a stall before my lunch comes back up. Most of it makes it into the bowl. The door to the stall closes behind me and I can feel how cold the floor is under my knees. It just keeps going. Everytime I think I‚Äôm finished, my body lets me know that I‚Äôm not. When I‚Äôm finally finished, it's hard to make my fingers let go of the porcelain so I can flush.

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not an easy job.‚Äù The voice echoes in the empty restroom. Tommy is in here with me. I never even heard the door open. I try to say something, but I spit instead; little chunks are still hiding behind my lips. ‚ÄúDepartment 49 people are honestly some of the strangest people I‚Äôve ever met in my life. I don‚Äôt think it's a good idea for you to stay there.‚Äù

‚ÄúWell‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs too late for that now. No special treatment.‚Äù I push myself away from the toilet and stand up. I open the stall door with shaking fingers. Tommy is standing by the row of sinks and I walk over and wash out my mouth.

‚ÄúCome on, Aaron. I‚Äôve got so many other places I can put you where you‚Äôd be of more use.‚Äù I spit.

‚ÄúThe program decided to put me in Department 49. If you override it, then it puts the entire system into question.‚Äù

‚ÄúI run the system, Aaron.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôll be ok. I just‚Ä¶ I caused the death of a five year old.‚Äù

‚ÄúAnd that‚Äôs unfortunate, but there will be others to take his place. You need to remember The Talk, or do I have to give it to you?‚Äù

‚ÄúI had The Talk when I was five, Tommy. And my mother gives me constant refreshers.‚Äù

‚ÄúThey give us what we need, and we give them enough. It‚Äôs simple.‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs different Tommy.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúHearing about it my whole life‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs different when you‚Äôre seeing it. When you‚Äôre talking to them.‚Äù

‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt think of them as human, Aaron. They‚Äôre nothing like us. You make that mistake and it‚Äôll drive you nuts.‚Äù

1jt0em5,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jt0em5/my_coworker_and_i_were_looking_for_the_storage/,"My coworker and I were looking for the storage closet, but got a staircase instead (Final Part)","*When I opened my eyes I was on the ground, not where I‚Äôd fallen asleep. I found myself back in the middle of the open basement. Sitting upright I wondered how I could‚Äôve moved myself so far without waking up, I‚Äôd never been one to sleepwalk.*

*There was something new now: a smell. I realized that throughout everything I hadn‚Äôt noticed anything distinct until now. I surely would have noticed this before if it had been there at least.*

*It was strong. A stench that I felt might even stick to my clothing if I didn‚Äôt get out of it soon. I hadn‚Äôt ever experienced it before, but it was like I‚Äôd left fruit around and let it rot, almost sweet. To make the scene better, I started to hear it again. That scraping.*

*I did a complete 180 trying to find the source of the noise, but I was alone. It ended just as quickly as it‚Äôd begun, like something decided to give me a glance over before deciding what to do with me.*

*I was now acutely aware that I was dreaming, and that Catherine was not in the basement with me, but something else was. I knew I was being stalked; watched. I also now knew that even though it was a dream, everything I was seeing was real.*

*After a moment it picked up again. Slow. Even. Scrapes that made my body tense.*

*My attention then drew to the door I hadn‚Äôt been able to open. It was closed. The scraping drew nearer, but I still couldn‚Äôt place its source. I knew something was about to bear down on me however, and my thoughts grew restless. Something was going to kill me, and I had no way to see it or defend myself. I was going to die. I remember thinking: Would anyone even find my body? What would happen to Catherine? All thoughts ended abruptly as the scraping ceased. I was left in silence apart from the beating of my own heart, which felt like it would fall from my chest at a moment‚Äôs notice. Something compelled me to turn around.*

*I came face to face with my assailant. It was touching noses with me. I stepped back, witness now to what I somehow knew had been down here all along. Now staring at it in the dim light, my body felt numb. I was no longer afraid, but there was nothing to replace it. I felt like I was staring back into the gap between the door and the darkness beyond it. There was nothing I could do, and hopelessness wasn‚Äôt even worth feeling. Things were so out of my control that there was no real use in even trying to fight. What was I doing trying to escape?*

*Then I was warm. Calm. I could‚Äôve stood to lose myself in the feeling, but I shook myself free of it. I couldn‚Äôt give in to that, I was interested in a way out, not comfort from not being able to find it. I told myself I would find it, if not for me then for her.*

*I turned my attention back to the thing. It dripped a liquid I couldn‚Äôt see well enough to identify as it towered over me. There aren‚Äôt many things I have to look up at to see clearly, but this thing had me craning my neck to get a good glimpse.*

*‚ÄúLighten.‚Äù*

*It commanded my attention. Trying to turn away was pointless as I felt I couldn‚Äôt move my body. I was frozen; forced to stare my death in the face without the choice to fight. Without even being able to feel the fear.*

*I then had the chance to study its features, the ones I could discern in the low light anyway. As I scanned its mostly round body, I found that I hadn‚Äôt really gotten a good look at the thing at all. If I had, I‚Äôm sure I wouldn‚Äôt have missed the faces I saw embedded in it. All of them looked to be in different states of fear or pain, like they‚Äôd been alive as they'd meshed together to make the thing that was speaking to me. I could also make out a few arms hanging limp, one or two fused by the flesh at the wrist and shoulder. I gathered that the thing must move around with the two that jutted out awkwardly ahead, boxing me in with it. They lacked defining muscle mass, and if I hadn‚Äôt watched the fingers twitch before me then, I would‚Äôve never known they were part of a living creature.*

*It had no eyes. I was aware of that. I knew it only saw me now because I was in this dream.*

*In terms of speaking, I couldn‚Äôt place a mouth that had moved from what I was seeing ahead of me. So, it had no real mouth, or one I could see at least; but I was hearing it so clearly. Again, the fear I was expecting to wash over me never came. I was indifferent to what I was seeing.*

*I wasn‚Äôt. I wasn‚Äôt anything. My body relaxed, and the muscles in my neck ached from the struggle I‚Äôd gone through trying to turn my head away the entire time. It was giving me a choice, I understood then. I found my voice again.*

*‚ÄúI want to go home.‚Äù*

*Silence. Its knuckles raised. It began to move forward.*

I shot up, truly awake, beside Catherine on the landing. My vision swam as I reached out to the sides of me to find my bearings in the dim light. I remembered the feelings, or lack of, I‚Äôd had before waking up, and still found myself numb. I couldn‚Äôt figure out why, not for lack of trying, but it was almost like I simply couldn‚Äôt feel. Emotions were locked behind some foggy wall in my mind. I felt as though I could reach in and touch them, but the feelings would never come over me.

Cathy stirred immediately, attempting to get on her feet, but fell back onto the staircase up to the door.

‚ÄúHa... What happened? You okay?‚Äù She rubbed her eyes furiously with one hand while putting the other out ahead of her. Once her eyes were open, she glanced from me to the open air around us and sighed. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck Adrian.‚Äù

She placed a hand on her chest and tilted her head up to breathe. ‚ÄúThat scared the shit outta me‚Ä¶‚Äù

‚ÄúSorry,‚Äù I spat ‚Äúawful dream.‚Äù

‚ÄúMust have been. You jumped pretty bad.‚Äù

I glanced away. ‚ÄúAnd you?‚Äù

‚ÄúDid I dream?‚Äù

I nodded.

‚ÄúNope. I basically shut my eyes and opened them. I feel like I haven‚Äôt slept at all actually.‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt know if I would‚Äôve preferred that. ‚ÄúI think I saw that thing the guy was dreaming about down here.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

I opened my mouth to explain, but the sound of a door slamming shut below stopped me. Everything was silent in the few moments that followed, the flickering from the lamps even seemed to die out. Before I could even think of releasing my breath and try reasoning out what we had just heard, the scraping began. I tensed. They were the same scrapes that I‚Äôd heard in my dream. I couldn‚Äôt believe our luck. The thing was real. I hadn‚Äôt even had the chance to say it to her.

I turned to Cathy, who had stiffened. She had to have no idea what was going on or what was about to happen. I didn‚Äôt either, but at least I‚Äôd already seen the thing. I knew we‚Äôd definitely have no chance if it decided to move up the stairs. We were going to have to go back down. Cathy‚Äôs eyes were wide, boring holes into me as I leaned in to whisper in her ear. It came out as barely a croak.

‚ÄúI need you to follow me as closely and quietly as you can. Okay?‚Äù

Feeling her nod against my cheek, she gripped the collar of my shirt. I wanted to tell her that everything would be fine, that there was something more we could look through or a key I had just misplaced in my pocket, but then figured what good was telling her that when I was having trouble believing it myself.

The scraping had gotten a little softer, leaving me to assume it‚Äôd gone down the hall to the lectern room. It was a perfect time for us to get down and hide. Trying to think of anything that might help, I remembered the power tools I‚Äôd found while we were searching earlier. I hadn‚Äôt seen if there was anything useful, but that was before I‚Äôd needed anything to get the door open. Maybe there was a crowbar or something I could use to just pry the thing off its hinges. Maybe that was a long stretch, but it was the best idea I could come up with at the time.

I pulled back and gestured for her to follow me. Taking a risk, I was hoping that the thing‚Äôs lack of eyes in my dream meant that in reality it couldn‚Äôt see me. Something told me I had the right idea as we carefully made our way down into the open basement. From the bottom of the steps there was a clear view down the hall to the lectern, and as we got to it, I heard the air catch in Catherine‚Äôs throat. I spun, her hands flying up to her mouth as I saw her gaze fix on the thing at the end of the hall. Tears welled in her eyes, and I turned to look as well.

There it was, arms outstretched, a trail of mystery liquid trailing behind it in large amounts as it pulled itself about the space. The smell had returned as well, and I heard a faint gurgle from Catherine‚Äôs throat. I shook my head slowly. Again, while I was staring at this thing, now in my actual reality, I felt little more than indifference. I decided that this wasn‚Äôt worth exploring now and grabbed Cathy‚Äôs remaining hand to pull her down the rest of the steps. Standing and staring wasn‚Äôt going to get us out, but I couldn‚Äôt blame her.

I led us over to the crates, feeling the need to glance back at the opening to the hall frequently. I still didn‚Äôt know if the thing could see us, and I definitely didn‚Äôt want to find out how well it could hear by moving too quickly. When we got to the crate I was looking for, I let go of her and leaned in to look at its contents again. Drills, but no bits that would do us any good. Small, handheld saws, but rusted to hell and missing teeth sporadically. They weren‚Äôt going to cut through anything. The smell of the sack seemed to mix with that of the rest of the basement. I unfolded the top and reached my hand in without looking, horrified by the sudden feeling of coarse hair between my fingers. I froze but fear never took hold. I wanted to feel, even though I knew I would‚Äôve been terrified. We never had seen what was at the end of that logbook. I reflexively squeezed my hand closed and felt a piece of paper amidst the hair. I tightened my hand around it, trying not to think too hard about the state of the body inside.

Trying to keep a gag stifled, I thrust my hand back out of the sack. I held it out ahead of me, squeezing my eyes shut as I tried convincing myself that I‚Äôd touched anything other than the corpse of the homeless man. It didn‚Äôt work, and my skin crawled as I turned my palm up and gazed at the note that laid in it. Unfolding it slowly, I strained my eyes and held it up to get a good look at what was written.

Fuck you.

I threw the note aside, useless. My gut was still hopeful that there was something we could use in there, but that would mean I had to stick my hand back in. I wasn‚Äôt looking to do that. If there was seriously nothing, then escape was hopeless. I didn‚Äôt want to just give up.

Glancing up at Catherine, I found her with her hands clasped together, lips moving silently as she stared at the doorway. I decided she wasn‚Äôt going to be any help and I was going to just have to pray my gut feeling was right. Biting my tongue to keep from gagging, I went back in. I left my hand balled in a fist as I felt past the distinct ridges of bones and instances of what I hoped wasn‚Äôt skin falling from it. I had to be careful as I moved down so as to not disturb them or cause everything to suddenly fall apart. I assumed the flesh that held things together now was in danger of coming undone at any moment. I stretched my fingers out cautiously, something damp coming into contact with me. My throat suddenly felt numb, and I was finding it a little difficult to still take breaths without heaving.

Suddenly Catherine ducked by my side. I hadn‚Äôt noticed until then, but the scraping was much louder than before. It had made its way back into the open room with us. My other arm found its way around Catherine‚Äôs waist, and I pulled her as close as I could. It was the only comfort I could afford her at the time. My breaths became deep and even, silent as I listened. Cathy held her hands over her mouth, eyes squeezed shut.

The sound grew closer, and a moment later I saw a hand land on the floor beside us. The fingers twitched, growing tense as it readied to heave the rest of its mass forward. Once it was positioned in front of our spot, it stopped moving. I closed my eyes, certain this would mean the end for us both, but when the sound of scraping came again, I reopened them to find the thing had moved past us. I couldn‚Äôt believe it; I‚Äôd been right.

With newfound confidence I let go of Catherine and dug my hand further down in the sack, touching the wet bottom. It was sopping from what I could feel, and I wished I had the ability to shrug the discomfort away. The scrapes were still close but were getting further. I knew it was looking for us, but then wondered what it would do if it got a hold of Catherine or me. I could have given this much more thought, but it was overshadowed entirely by a new feeling beneath my fingers. Metal.

I grabbed whatever I‚Äôd found and reclaimed my arm. It fell over, smacking the side of the crate with a loud thud that sounded through the space like a gunshot. The scraping stopped abruptly. I looked to Catherine, and found her staring back at me, eyes wide, face pale, and held up the object between my fingers.

A key.

I grabbed Catherine‚Äôs hand and shot up. The scraping had started again, a bit faster-paced than before. I couldn‚Äôt see it yet, but I knew it was going to be on us soon. I found Cathy by my feet still, so I tugged her hand up to urge her on with me. She took a moment, but ultimately stood. I had to drag her forward, ushering us along as I now had no regard for the amount of noise we were making. I had our ticket out.

The scraping picked up, causing Cathy to break from her stupor. ‚ÄúWhat the fuck is that thing?‚Äù

‚ÄúHow should I fucking know? C‚Äômon, you gotta move faster.‚Äù I shoved her ahead of me as we made it to the steps, and we both took them two at a time. With her now ahead I was going to have to reach past her to get the key in the lock.

It was now that the fear began returning to me. Instead of coming on gradually, it hit me all at once. My nose stung, my heart pounded, and I felt like I might die. Despite this, we made it to the door, but we didn‚Äôt hurry to get it open until I heard the distinct sound of the thing‚Äôs large palms slapping against the ground.

I turned. To my horror, it was already at the landing.

I turned again, anxiety spreading like fire through me. I scrambled to hold the key straight and pushed Catherine aside to get to the door. My hands were shaking so badly I thought I‚Äôd drop it if I didn‚Äôt take my time. Time was something I knew I didn‚Äôt have, so I fought through the shakiness.

Cathy gripped my arm tight, and I heard her sniffle while muttering a prayer. I can‚Äôt stand to imagine, even now, what was going through her mind at that moment.

Then, I heard the door lock click. I grabbed her, not bothering to turn and see how close the thing had gotten before forcing my shoulder into the door and falling through with my partner in tow. We both hit the ground just outside, and I forced the door back shut without a second thought. Something wailed against it just behind. Cathy sat a few feet ahead of me, eyes unmoving from the door. The ring of keys was just on the hook beside me, so I grabbed it, shoved the rusty one back in, and turned until I heard another satisfying click.

The banging ceased immediately.

I spun the key off the hook and set the rest of the ring back where I‚Äôd grabbed it. I took a step back, finding my place beside Catherine before getting on my knees. ‚ÄúI think‚Ä¶‚Äù I glanced from the door to her. ‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs over.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat do we even do about that?‚Äù

I couldn‚Äôt help but laugh. After everything she somehow had it in her mind that this was something she had to deal with. I found myself looking at the door again. The insanity of that idea had me reeling. I mean, what the fuck did she think she was gonna do? It must‚Äôve been funny to her as well, because after a few moments Cathy started to chuckle with me.

‚ÄúWhat am I saying?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno, but I think we take the keys and leave.‚Äù

‚ÄúLeave? Where?‚Äù

‚ÄúI dunno. Home? Forget about all of this, get rid of these keys, and never mention this to anyone.‚Äù

She seemed to think about it, taking hold of my arm and pulling herself close. ‚ÄúJust forget about everything?‚Äù

‚ÄúTry to. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll forget that thing.‚Äù

She was quiet for a moment. ‚ÄúDid you see how close it got?‚Äù

I hadn‚Äôt, but the thought of what she must‚Äôve thought as it climbed up towards us kept me silent. We shared a few more quiet breaths before she jumped to attention. ‚ÄúWhat time is it?‚Äù

It then occurred to me that we very well could‚Äôve been down in that basement all night, maybe even well into the next day, and I still wasn‚Äôt hearing anyone in the store. I shook my head unknowingly, standing as she jumped to her feet and dashed into the kitchen. It hardly mattered to me at that point whether I was going to keep my job as a fry cook or not.

‚ÄúNo way.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

No response. I walked out to the front to see Catherine at the register, mouth agape. ‚ÄúCatherine, what‚Äôs wrong?‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs midnight.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe were down there the whole day? Jesus Christ. No one came in?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo Adrian, midnight midnight. Like, today.‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm not following.‚Äù

‚ÄúWe went down there around 10 on the 16th, it‚Äôs midnight now. It‚Äôs the 17th. We were only down there for 2 hours.‚Äù

I shook my head, that couldn‚Äôt have been right. The entire ordeal at the door we‚Äôd just fought to get through felt like 2 hours on its own. Either we had seriously moved quickly and didn‚Äôt catch any sleep, or there was something wrong with time down there. Opting to not explore that line of thought, I just kept shaking my head.

‚ÄúYou know what. I don‚Äôt care. I‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù

‚ÄúWhat?‚Äù

‚ÄúI‚Äôm leaving.‚Äù I began to walk towards the back to grab my things when I called back to her ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre welcome to join me if you want, but just know I‚Äôm not coming back.‚Äù

I gathered my things just as quickly as I‚Äôd laid them out, and upon returning to the front room I found Catherine with her things, waiting for me by the door. I wanted to smile, but after everything it felt in-genuine, so I just nodded towards the lot.

The drive out we shared in silence. I went 55. I didn‚Äôt bother to ask about dates or her interests or what kind of coffee she liked. I couldn‚Äôt find it in me to care. There were so many things I wanted to know, but I swore then I‚Äôd never go back down in that basement. Even as I recount the story now, I can feel its gaze on me. I can hear its voice rasping through the dim light. I can smell it.

So, all of this to say: If you somehow get your hands on a key, you‚Äôve never seen before and use it to unlock a door, don‚Äôt go in. It‚Äôs in there. It‚Äôs looking for someone, and if you aren‚Äôt it, you‚Äôre dead.",1,1743962905.0,nosleep,0,1.0,False
1jt0ejb,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1jt0ejb/ive_f28_been_drifting_away_from_my_longtime_best/,I‚Äôve (f/28) been drifting away from my long-time best friend (f/28) for years and unsure what to do about upcoming event?,"I‚Äôve been best friends with a group of girls (we‚Äôll call them Jessica, Alana, and Britney) since high school (2010). We‚Äôre a group, but in the group we have our ‚Äúpairs‚Äù and me and Alana have always been a pair and Jessica and Britney have been a pair. Best friends within the best friend group. 
I was so close with Alana - we did everything together. Even when I moved a few hours away from school.

Fast forward to 2020, and I break up with my long-term abusive boyfriend and so does Jessica. Jessica and I move in together, and the group is so happy to be back together. Alana and Britney are the only 2 left in relationships. 

After a group hangout one night, Britney and Alana head home. Jessica and I get a call shortly after, and it‚Äôs Alana crying and freaking out because she came home..grabbed her boyfriend‚Äôs phone and locked herself in the car(?) and went through it and found out he was cheating. We told her we were coming to get her and she could spend the night with us..she said ok. We get there around midnight despite having to work the next day, and Alana tells us to hang on they‚Äôre just talking. We wait. We wait until 2 am. Then she comes out the house and sits in the car and asks where we wanna go. We were confused and said home bc it‚Äôs 2 am and we‚Äôre here to grab you so you can come spend the night at our place to get away from this?

She said oh no never mind, I‚Äôm gonna spend the night here. So we were obviously a bit upset at this and I gave her a tough-love kind of conversation about what happened, how she‚Äôs worth more and needs to leave him etc etc. she was very quiet and things felt awkward and long story short, she got out and we went home.

The next day all three of us invite her over to mine and Jessica‚Äôs house and we have flowers and chocolate waiting for her. She acts oblivious about why we got her flowers and are being so weird. We said because we presumed she‚Äôd be upset about her boyfriend cheating on her. She said she‚Äôs fine and wants to move on. So we share a look but respect her wishes. 

Things have NEVER been the same with me and Alana. She told Jessica and Britney that she was more mad at ME for the conversation I had with her (I was trying to be a good friend! Of course I don‚Äôt want my best friend to be with a cheater! I would expect all my friends to do the same for me!) than she was at her boyfriend for cheating.

That really hurt me. I gave her some space, and we eventually drifted to only talking in the groupchat and at very sparse group hangouts. It‚Äôs been this way ever since. We both know things are not the same, but we don‚Äôt really acknowledge it. I don‚Äôt say anything because I just miss my friend and want things to go back to normal. I text her all the time and tell her I miss her, let‚Äôs hang out soon etc.

She says the same..but things never come to fruition. Even recently, she just broke up with said cheating boyfriend so Jessica and I wanted to bake her a congrats on the breakup cake and hang out and give it to her. She said she wasn‚Äôt free because she has to work, then later posted to her story hanging out this girl that she‚Äôs most definitely become best friends with over the last few years. 

We had a group hangout a few weeks ago and the whole vibe was SO AWKWARD because something felt so off with her. She was quiet and barely interacting with us. She didn‚Äôt even acknowledge me when I sat down next to her until I said something. I brushed it off but it hurt. 

I brought her flowers and coffee to work the other day when she told me she officially broke up with the boyfriend, but she was in a staff meeting (I didn‚Äôt know I wanted to surprise and cheer her up) so I didn‚Äôt even really get to talk to her, but she was grateful for the flowers and posted it on insta and tagged me.

Anyway‚Ä¶all that to say so you know the status of our friendship and how uncomfortable things really are right now.

I keep trying to save our best-friendness and do stupid things like ask her if she wants to go to a concert to an artist we used to love and see when we were younger. She said yes and talked about how excited she is! But the concert is on Tuesday and we haven‚Äôt talked since she said thank you for the flowers‚Ä¶and honestly, after our last hang out where I kinda just sat quietly beside her really has me feeling sad and not interested in going to spend time with her one on one anymore.

I don‚Äôt know what to do. Go to the concert and try to pretend like everything is okay like I have for the last 5 years, or tell her I‚Äôm not up for it and offer my ticket to her friend so they can go? I feel like I would be more comfortable with the second option because I really am just so sad about the loss of our friendship and the idea of standing next to her, singing along to songs we used to scream together‚Ä¶just idk. It feels awful to think about.

Please give me some advice on what to do about the event, and I guess the friendship in general?
Having a sit down conversation with her about this stuff would NOT go well so it‚Äôs not really an option. My peaceful options are: go and pretend and then stop making any attempts to keep a friendship going, or bow out of the event and also still stop making any attempts to keep a friendship going.

I think I‚Äôm done being the only one..but idk. My head is so muddy I need an outsiders perspective. Please help. 

TL;DR: my best friend got upset with me for a tough-love conversation around her cheating boyfriend 5 years ago, and friendship hasn‚Äôt been the same. I keep trying and it doesn‚Äôt seem like she does. Last hangout was super awkward and uncomfortable for me, but we have a concert coming up this week bc I‚Äôm dumb and keep trying to get us to connect. Do I go, or do I bow out and say somethings come up? Move on with my life?

I'm an audhd person who works at a coffee shop. My shift lead makes it a living hell for me. I have asked my managers to not schedule me with her but they either ignore me or tell me no. Even worse, they started scheduling me with her even more, alone with her for hours. 

She's in her late 30s and i'm in my late teens. She will nitpick everything i do, yell at me for facial expressions i make that i'm not aware are bad, yell at me for being overwhelmed (while she is the one making me overwhelmed by yelling and panicking during rushes), will push for me to wear makeup at work and make me feel ugly, she will call and tell the managers whenever i do something that bothers her (she got upset with me for sighing after i made a mistake, she said it was rude for me to ""sigh at her"", i explained to her i was sighing at my own mistake [which was me dropping a pack of cups, then picking them up right after] but she went and called the higher ups over it anyways), she yells and humiliates me in front of customers, when i try to bond or joke with her she ignores me, she only speaks to me if she thinks she can make it negative, she talks crap about me to my coworkers, she tells customers and coworkers that i'm ""in my own world"" and am stupid

It's made my mental health horrible.

All my coworkers who work with me now like her because she doesn't do this to them. My managers told me that she has had complaints filed against her for bullying in the past but i should just ""talk to her"". The people she did bully do not work with her anymore. I was thinking of talking to our union but she is also protected under the union. I was scheduled to work with her today but called out. I'm scheduled to work with her tomorrow, too and cannot deal with it anymore. Some of what she says triggers really bad thoughts for me and makes me feel like a useless weirdo. I don't know how to get out of tomorrow.

Better sleep. More rested. Works MUCH better. Makes better decisions.

More deep sleep (I am tracking it). More REM sleep too. The bonus is psychological and mental.

I am making better decisions. Instead of making decisions in a (caffeine) rush, my brain is more relaxed and sharp. This is the greatest benefit for me so far.

I saw someone else in this group write that ""he had to drink coffee again"" after several months off, because he had an important assignment. I would be very worried about taking caffeine before such an important job. He said he worked in a very competitive job.

I do too. Digital marketing.

My success is measured in numbers every day, and I have a billion competitors; everyone is doing digital marketing, and many are very clever people.

I cannot afford to let a drug like caffeine ruin that.

I was also a heavy smoker 10 years ago. 30 cigarettes a day. The mind games nicotine plays on you are a lot like caffeine. ""I need my cigarette to relax, or focus, or to be myself.""

All addiction nonsense. Non-smokers don't need it, and people who are not caffeine-dependent don't need caffeine.

It just makes things worse. But at least most of the time, you are up against other caffeine addicts, so the odds are evened out.

It's a long story, but this has been better for me than stopping cigarettes and weed (I was heavily addicted to that for 12 years too).

Only after 2 weeks, I started to cry in the shower because I can feel how much this is going to change things for me, especially for my job. My focus and dexterity are incredible. No more crashes, no more brain jitters to make me make the wrong decisions.

I have been drinking 3-4 cups of coffee a day for 35 years. I'm 53. Before that, I primarily consumed caffeine in colas and sports drinks. So, most of my life, really.

Emotionally, it has also made me calmer and happier.

We thought this was a starter apartment but, alas, we are not leaving any time soon! We have this front room that opens into a back room with French doors. You can see the kitchen is rather tight too. I actually initially had the living room in the first room with a larger sectional, and the back room was my ‚Äúgetting ready & office‚Äù room.

- way more storage for clothes & misc items
- Would love a dining table to eat at vs the pull up coffee table we had before

Met this girl on dating app, she seemed well educated and nice, not at all the type to talk to multiple guys and such. She was not very active on the app though, and we only really started talking a few days after our first interaction. We went out, had a great time, she told me she appreciated that I was caring and nice, that I was attentive, she said she felt safe with me.   
Anyway, fast forward a few weeks, we were talking daily, saw eachother 1-2 times a week, she was even at my place and we cooked together, cuddled, made out a bunch, etc. She mentioned how she's really attracted to me, that she misses me repeatedly and that she enjoys spending time together a lot. She even said she told her friends and family about me.  
We had already made plans for the following week, we were supposed to go workout together and then repeat the cooking together activity.  
We met up today, everything seemed totally fine, we held hands, walked around, kissed, had interesting discussions. Then when I get home we chat and she says she feels like something is missing and that while she appreciates all the effort I've put in, she doesn't want to continue, as she has been feeling like something was missing for some time and she wanted to see if time would help with things, but apparently it didn't.  
We did have a call after in which I told her I wish her the best and that I still think she's a great person, and I did ask what she thinks is missing... she did mention chemistry, which was vague, but she did finally mention she wishes she was more attracted to me, but I didn't get the feel that she only meant physically.

  
I was really blindsighted by this, as things seemed fine on our date today. Her previous mentions of attractiveness and enjoyment really clashes with what she told me today. On our date she even admitted of telling her family about me.   
What did I do wrong, really? Am I too nice, too open? I always tried to make her feel comfortable, even bought her flowers on our first date as it was Woman's Day here.. and I tried to choose restaurants and activities that I thought she might enjoy, based on what she told me. I always paid for everything, even though she did once offer to split the bill.. I only let her pay for coffee once, today, as she insisted because I always paid up until then. I always remembered the details she told me, what she likes, what she dislikes, her birthday, family and work afairs, to show that I am truly interested. Not in a weird way or anything, I just have a good memory I guess, especially if I am interested in someone.

Just wrapped up watching all of Gilmore Girls (the original series ‚Äî NOT A Year in the Life, let‚Äôs be clear!).

Born in 1996 in India, I‚Äôve never really gotten attached to many shows ‚Äî aside from Friends and How I Met Your Mother. I tend to get bored, anxious, or just plain overwhelmed when starting something new, so I usually stick to reruns. But Gilmore Girls? It had me hooked from the very first episode.

I actually started and I told myself I‚Äôd give it a fair shot‚Ä¶ but in truth? I was already all in by episode one. Even though I didn‚Äôt catch every American reference, the heart of the show spoke to me. It was my cup of ‚Äúcoffee‚Äù

Living in the Bay Area now (still holding out hope for a Logan sighting, honestly), I can say ASP‚Äôs run till Season 6 was pure magic. Yes, the last couple seasons dipped ‚Äî but still, that final episode? It wrecked me in the best way.

From the start, I was Team Jess. But life‚Äôs funny ‚Äî I had three ‚ÄúDean-Jess-Logan‚Äù boys in my own story, and somewhere along the way, Logan won me over. I ended up marrying my very own Logan. (Yep. I said yes to my Logan.)

What do I love most about this show? Everything. The Lorelai-Rory bond. The town meetings. Lane and her double life. The Friday night dinners. The town parties. Luke being grumpy and perfect. And the boys ‚Äî oh, the boys. Jess and Logan are neck and neck for me.

Yale felt like a dream ‚Äî I always wanted to go to an Ivy (Hopkins grad here, so close but not quite!). It gave me the New England nostalgia I didn‚Äôt even know I needed as a Southwest girl.

Anyway, time to go cry a little bit now and drink coffee from my Gilmore Girls coffee cup.  Thanks, Stars Hollow.",3,1743962147.0,GilmoreGirls,2,1.0,False

Hey, MaximizeMe family! üòä

So, here‚Äôs a little confession: I‚Äôve been *hustling* my way through the workweek like a caffeinated squirrel. üêøÔ∏è You know the type‚Äîworking late, clocking in those extra hours, and feeling like I‚Äôm winning at the adulting game. But guess what? Recently, I found a way to cut my workday by TWO HOURS! Yeah, you read that right. And it‚Äôs not because I learned how to teleport. 

It‚Äôs all about habit stacking. Sounds fancy, right? But trust me, it‚Äôs simpler than it sounds.

**Here‚Äôs the kicker:** Habit stacking isn‚Äôt just about cramming more into your day; it‚Äôs about layering habits so that they flow smoothly together, freeing up **mental space** for what really matters. üß†‚ú® 

### How I Did It:

1. **Identify your keystone habits:** What‚Äôs that one thing you do that makes everything else easier? For me, it‚Äôs journaling in the morning. It sets the tone for my day! 

2. **Stack related tasks:** Every time I sit down to journal, I also take 5 minutes to plan my top 3 priorities for the day. This way, I‚Äôm not just writing down my thoughts; I‚Äôm also laser-focused on what needs to get done. 

3. **Limit distractions:** This was a game changer. I started toggling off notifications for anything that doesn‚Äôt involve a cat video or my work tasks. Do I *really* need to be notified about the new flavor of chips on sale? Probably not. 

4. **Scheduled breaks (and snack time!):** Yes, breaks can be super productive. I realized that if I took 10 minutes to stretch or grab a snack, I returned to my work feeling refreshed and ready to dive back in. Plus, snacks equal happiness, right? üçéüç´

5. **End-of-day ritual:** I now spend the last 10 minutes of my workday reflecting on what worked and what didn‚Äôt. This insight helps me tweak my habits for the next day. Spoiler alert: sometimes, my biggest ‚Äúwin‚Äù is just getting to avoid my *third* coffee! ‚òïÔ∏è

**Why It Works:**

- **Mental Clarity:** With fewer tasks weighing me down, I‚Äôm no longer swimming in a sea of to-dos. It‚Äôs like I‚Äôve got a mental declutter going on! 

- **Boosted Productivity:** I‚Äôm tackling tasks in shorter bursts, which means I‚Äôm more focused and less likely to scroll through social media (oops). 

- **You get your life back:** Less time at your desk = more time for hobbies, friends, or binge-watching that series everyone‚Äôs talking about. (Don‚Äôt act like you don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about! üòú)

So, here I am, chasing my dreams and still having time to binge-watch *yet another* show. 

I‚Äôd love to hear your thoughts on habit stacking! Have any of you tried this, or are you curating **your own** secret hacks for productivity? Let‚Äôs swap tips and keep this momentum going! üöÄ",1,1743962118.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

1jt0382,https://www.reddit.com/r/uber/comments/1jt0382/the_roadblock_before_the_road_my_frustrating/,The Roadblock Before the Road: My Frustrating Journey Through Uber Sign-Up and Support,"So, you're thinking about driving for Uber? The promise of flexible hours and earning extra money to pay off debt or to afford groceries? I thought so too. I was genuinely excited to hit the road, meet new people, and earn some extra income here in Seattle. But before I could even think about my first pickup, I hit a series of frustrating roadblocks: the Uber sign-up process and the labyrinth known as Uber Support. If you're considering signing up, or if you're stuck in the process right now, grab a coffee ‚Äì you might relate to this.

**The Sign-Up Gauntlet: More Hurdles Than Highways**

You'd think signing up would be straightforward. Download the app, upload your documents, pass a background check, and go. Simple. Except, in my experience, it was anything but.

* **Document Drama:** This was the first major headache. Uploading my driver's license felt like playing a guessing game. My driver‚Äôs license photo, clear as day to me, was rejected multiple times for glare errors. Trying to take a picture of a high gloss card without a light glare on it is almost impossible. It was just repeated rejections that left me resubmitting the same type of pictures, hoping one would magically stick.¬†
* **The Background Check Black Hole:** Once the documents were *finally* accepted, the background check began or at least it should have. For some reason my background check would not start. Mind you, I started this process on March 6, 2025. Uber gives you an estimated timeframe, but mine seemed to stretch on... and on. The frustrating part wasn't just the wait; it was the complete lack of communication. Days turned into weeks, and the status in the app remained stubbornly unchanged. You start to wonder: Did they forget about me? Is there a problem? You're left completely in the dark, unable to start earning.
* **I signed up to rent a car through the app:** While my background check was waiting there was a spot where I could actually rent a car. It was odd that I had that option and yet my background check had not even started.

This wasn't just inconvenient; it felt like the system was designed to be nontransparent. Every step felt like it *could* go wrong, and often did, with little clear guidance on how to fix it.

**Entering the Support Maze: Help That Doesn't Always Help**

Naturally, when I hit these snags, I turned to Uber Support, hoping for clarification or a resolution. Unfortunately, this often felt like trading one frustration for another.

* **Finding Help is the First Challenge:** Forget easily finding a direct phone number. You're often funneled through layers of automated help articles and chatbot prompts within the app. Getting to a real human feels like an achievement in itself.
* **The Canned Response Cycle:** When I *did* manage to connect (usually via chat or email), the initial responses often felt like cut-and-paste paragraphs that didn't *actually* address my specific issue. Explaining my unique document problem often resulted in a generic reply about *how* to upload documents ‚Äì something I clearly already knew how to do! It felt like talking to a wall that occasionally sent irrelevant form letters.
* **Agent Roulette:** Sometimes, if you persist, you get different answers from different support agents regarding the *same issue*. One agent might tell you to re-upload a document, another might say it's under review, and a third might suggest something else entirely. This inconsistency just adds to the confusion and delays.
* **Lack of Resolution:** The ultimate frustration was the feeling that support wasn't empowered or equipped to actually *solve* complex sign-up problems quickly. Issues that seemed simple (like clarifying a document requirement) could drag on for days, requiring multiple contacts and endless patience.

**The Toll: More Than Just Lost Time**

This whole process wasn't just a time sink; it was genuinely stressful. You're eager to start earning, but you're stuck in bureaucratic limbo. You start questioning if it's even worth the hassle. It felt impersonal, like navigating a faceless system that wasn't particularly driver-friendly, especially *before* you've even given your first ride.

**Final Thoughts & A Word of Warning**

I eventually got through the process as my background check cleared on April 4, 2025, but it was significantly more challenging than I anticipated. Driving for Uber might still be the right choice for you, but go in with your eyes open.

* **Be Prepared for Delays:** The timelines provided are estimates. Factor in potential delays, especially with documents and background checks.
* **Be Persistent (But Patient):** If you hit a snag with support, you'll likely need to be persistent. Document everything ‚Äì take screenshots of errors and conversations if possible.
* **Know You're Not Alone:** If you're feeling frustrated, know that many drivers have faced similar hurdles.

While the promise of driving is appealing, the reality of getting started can test your patience. Uber could significantly improve the driver experience by making their sign-up process more transparent and their support more responsive and effective.

**What about you? Did you face challenges signing up for Uber or dealing with their support? Share your experiences in the comments below ‚Äì let's help each other navigate the system!**

Ever feel like **time blocking** is meant for superhumans with mystical powers and 48-hour days? üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Yeah... me too. I tried it and quickly became the proud owner of a calendar that looked like a spilled Skittles pack. 

So, confession time: **Time blocking used to stress me out even more.** There, I said it. But then... I discovered a **10-minute tweak** that literally saved me 10 hours each week. Yep, you read that right. And the best part? No magic wands required. üòé

**Here‚Äôs the deal:**

1. **Start Small.** Ever plan an entire day and then get NOTHING done? Same. Try scheduling only the first 1-2 hours. Once I stopped overloading my calendar, everything started clicking into place.

2. **10-Minute Planning Sessions.** Every night, spend just 10 minutes breathing life into your calendar for the next day. Include **buffer zones**. Think life isn‚Äôt going to throw surprises? ü§î Oh, it will.

3. **Theme Your Days.** Mondays: Meetings & admin. Wednesdays: Creative projects. It's like wearing different shoes for different occasions. (Sneakers to loafers, anyone?)

4. **Flexible Priority List:** Each morning, jot down the top 3 things you MUST accomplish. Just 3. Other things happen? Fabulous! But your day‚Äôs a win even if only those 3 are checked off.

5. **Use Alarms.** Not kidding, my phone beeps at me like a needy Tamagotchi. It's a lifesaver for moving on when you‚Äôre deep into YouTube cat video vortexes. üòÇ

And you're thinking... sure, sounds great, but HOW does this save 10 hours? It's all about avoid *time leaks* ‚Äì those sneaky 15-minutes here and there that magically vanish into snack breaks and procrastination!

I‚Äôve found myself with extra time for walks, random hobbies, and even impromptu coffee meet-ups that *used* to feel impossible. ‚òïÔ∏è

So, what's your take? What mini-hacks have surprised you lately?

1jszuyt,https://www.reddit.com/r/uberdrivers/comments/1jszuyt/the_roadblock_before_the_road_my_frustrating/,The Roadblock Before the Road: My Frustrating Journey Through Uber Sign-Up and Support,"So, you're thinking about driving for Uber? The promise of flexible hours and earning extra money to pay off debt or to afford groceries? I thought so too. I was genuinely excited to hit the road, meet new people, and earn some extra income here in Seattle. But before I could even think about my first pickup, I hit a series of frustrating roadblocks: the Uber sign-up process and the labyrinth known as Uber Support. If you're considering signing up, or if you're stuck in the process right now, grab a coffee ‚Äì you might relate to this.

**The Sign-Up Gauntlet: More Hurdles Than Highways**

You'd think signing up would be straightforward. Download the app, upload your documents, pass a background check, and go. Simple. Except, in my experience, it was anything but.

* **Document Drama:** This was the first major headache. Uploading my driver's license felt like playing a guessing game. My driver‚Äôs license photo, clear as day to me, was rejected multiple times for glare errors. Trying to take a picture of a high gloss card without a light glare on it is almost impossible. It was just repeated rejections that left me resubmitting the same type of pictures, hoping one would magically stick.¬†
* **The Background Check Black Hole:** Once the documents were *finally* accepted, the background check began or at least it should have. For some reason my background check would not start. Mind you, I started this process on March 6, 2025. Uber gives you an estimated timeframe, but mine seemed to stretch on... and on. The frustrating part wasn't just the wait; it was the complete lack of communication. Days turned into weeks, and the status in the app remained stubbornly unchanged. You start to wonder: Did they forget about me? Is there a problem? You're left completely in the dark, unable to start earning.
* **I signed up to rent a car through the app:** While my background check was waiting there was a spot where I could actually rent a car. It was odd that I had that option and yet my background check had not even started.

This wasn't just inconvenient; it felt like the system was designed to be nontransparent. Every step felt like it *could* go wrong, and often did, with little clear guidance on how to fix it.

**Entering the Support Maze: Help That Doesn't Always Help**

Naturally, when I hit these snags, I turned to Uber Support, hoping for clarification or a resolution. Unfortunately, this often felt like trading one frustration for another.

* **Finding Help is the First Challenge:** Forget easily finding a direct phone number. You're often funneled through layers of automated help articles and chatbot prompts within the app. Getting to a real human feels like an achievement in itself.
* **The Canned Response Cycle:** When I *did* manage to connect (usually via chat or email), the initial responses often felt like cut-and-paste paragraphs that didn't *actually* address my specific issue. Explaining my unique document problem often resulted in a generic reply about *how* to upload documents ‚Äì something I clearly already knew how to do! It felt like talking to a wall that occasionally sent irrelevant form letters.
* **Agent Roulette:** Sometimes, if you persist, you get different answers from different support agents regarding the *same issue*. One agent might tell you to re-upload a document, another might say it's under review, and a third might suggest something else entirely. This inconsistency just adds to the confusion and delays.
* **Lack of Resolution:** The ultimate frustration was the feeling that support wasn't empowered or equipped to actually *solve* complex sign-up problems quickly. Issues that seemed simple (like clarifying a document requirement) could drag on for days, requiring multiple contacts and endless patience.

**The Toll: More Than Just Lost Time**

This whole process wasn't just a time sink; it was genuinely stressful. You're eager to start earning, but you're stuck in bureaucratic limbo. You start questioning if it's even worth the hassle. It felt impersonal, like navigating a faceless system that wasn't particularly driver-friendly, especially *before* you've even given your first ride.

**Final Thoughts & A Word of Warning**

I eventually got through the process as my background check cleared on April 4, 2025, but it was significantly more challenging than I anticipated. Driving for Uber might still be the right choice for you, but go in with your eyes open.

* **Be Prepared for Delays:** The timelines provided are estimates. Factor in potential delays, especially with documents and background checks.
* **Be Persistent (But Patient):** If you hit a snag with support, you'll likely need to be persistent. Document everything ‚Äì take screenshots of errors and conversations if possible.
* **Know You're Not Alone:** If you're feeling frustrated, know that many drivers have faced similar hurdles.

While the promise of driving is appealing, the reality of getting started can test your patience. Uber could significantly improve the driver experience by making their sign-up process more transparent and their support more responsive and effective.

BUT I had to take two pee breaks that interrupted my run and my rhythm (and cost me more than a minute in total).

  
Now I (m/39, running for about 18 months) am usually quite healthy, especially when it comes to bladder, all good in this regard. sometimes I have to pee on slower runs in training, but on race day (5k - hm until today) I never had to. And today, idk, I mean there was definitely quite some fluid that wanted to get out, so the bladder was full both times. I did not drink a lot of stuff before, like always some tea, coffee and water, some porridge with banana for breakfast (again, my everyday thing) and a gel befoe the start, right after I went to pee the final time.

  
I know the coffee would push some of the liquid out, but I always have coffee in the morning and I have the feeling it was more like some of the food I had the night before (was eating bread/rolls before going to bed, the carbs..). Like, idk, I am a bit confused because as I said, it wasn't 'a few nervous drops' - any ideas on what to change in my race prep or what to avoid (besides coffee which is not debatable ;). thanks in advance!",13,1743961485.0,AdvancedRunning,5,0.93,False

A few weeks ago, I finally put all the ideas I‚Äôd been gathering into action. 

I started small: one garbage bag, one room at a time, clockwise, top to bottom. I tossed anything that was clearly trash‚Äîbits of string, stray bobby pins, hair ties, random clutter. It was weirdly satisfying.

Then I tackled the guilt pile. You know, the big items you keep because ‚Äúmaybe one day‚Äù? Yeah‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt use them, so out they went. I also got rid of duplicates‚Äîcosmetics, half-empty jars, extra containers, decor I wasn‚Äôt feeling anymore. If it didn‚Äôt spark joy (or use), it left.

Then I got sick. Bummer, but I did my best to still pick up and sort stuff into piles whenever I passed by anything, it was exhausting and all I wanted to do was lay there (and I did) but I used the little time I was standing around waiting for food or tea to pick up.

Today I finally felt better and did all my ‚Äúleft for later‚Äù tasks: cleaning electronics, fixing light fixtures, sorting bathroom stuff, washing bedding and hanging curtains (even the bathroom, new liners and stuff). Collecting todays garbage all in big bags helped a lot‚Äîit made me feel the weight of stuff leaving my space, like a detox. I vacuumed top to bottom, and even though I still have some heavy furniture to deal with, I‚Äôm asking for help this time (no more back pain for me!). Picking up while being sick actually helped as most things were already in the right rooms, they just needed to be put away! I was also so annoyed by some areas that it really helped in tossing more than I would have.

Right now, I‚Äôm sipping coffee in a calm, open space‚Äîand honestly, I feel so proud. If you‚Äôve been meaning to declutter, this is your sign. You don‚Äôt have to do it all at once. Start with a bag. It adds up. You‚Äôll feel the shift.

No idea what's going on. Details in post.","\*\*Flaired as a hardware problem, but from initial googling it looks like it can really be a range of problems.

PC freezes and resets approximately 20-30 minutes after initial boot, then is fine for the rest of the day. My daily routine is start up PC in the morning, do some mundane browsing and checking of emails while I drink coffee, put PC in sleep while I do chores or go to work, then at night I wake up the PC from sleep, do some gaming, shut it down for the night (from the start menu of course), and go to bed. Rinse repeat.

However, the past three days, like clockwork, when I first boot up the PC from being off during the night and am doing simple mundane tasks that don't put the PC under load, after about 20-30 minutes, it freezes for a minute, then resets itself, and then is fine for the rest of the day. No idea what's going on.

EDIT: Additionally, when I checked the event logs, not only do I see the critical kernel power event from this freezing and resetting, there's also a bunch of random critical kernel power events logged over the past several months. Haven't been forcing shutdowns, haven't been losing power, haven't been crashing, etc. They're seemingly a mystery.

\*\*Government-Supported Community Spaces: Revitalizing Public Life & Reducing Digital Dependency\*\*  
\*A Practical Framework for Social Reconnection\*

---

### \*\*The Challenge: Isolation in a Digitally Dominated World\*\*  
While social media platforms offer a veneer of connectivity, they often prioritize engagement metrics over genuine human interaction. This results in digital spaces cluttered with algorithm-driven content, bots, and commercial agendas. Meanwhile, public spaces‚Äîparks and recreation centers supported by taxpayer dollars‚Äîare underused. This initiative proposes a government-coordinated, weekly gathering that transforms these spaces into warm, unbranded hubs for organic, low-pressure connection. The goal is to reintroduce the simple pleasure of face-to-face interaction in a setting that feels safe, human, and free of overt market influences.

---

### \*\*Core Proposal\*\*

\*\*1. Weekly Community Hours in Public Spaces\*\*  
   - \*\*Structure\*\*:  
     - \*\*Fixed Time/Location\*\*: Every Saturday from 10 AM‚Äì2 PM at centrally located parks or recreation centers, with indoor backup plans for inclement weather.  
     - \*\*No-Cost Amenities & Food\*\*:  
       - Complimentary light refreshments such as coffee, sandwiches, and community potluck-style offerings.  
       - Food is provided in a way that emphasizes community sharing rather than commercial branding, creating a space that feels removed from market pressures.
     - \*\*Activity Zones & Games\*\*:  
       - \*\*Interactive Games\*\*: Gentle physical activities like tug-of-war, board games, or other simple challenges that are fun yet not overly competitive.  
       - \*\*Small Prizes & Rewards\*\*: Winners of these games or challenges receive modest, community-sourced prizes (e.g., tokens, handmade items, or local crafts) to incentivize participation without creating a commercial atmosphere.
     - \*\*Subtle Support\*\*:  
       - Social workers or community volunteers are available at an informal ‚ÄúHelp & Conversation‚Äù booth, offering guidance only upon request.  
   - \*\*Activities\*\*:  
     - Optional, themed sessions such as ‚ÄúSkill Swap Hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúLocal History Talks‚Äù encourage dialogue and skill sharing without making participation feel obligatory.

\*\*2. Funding & Partnerships\*\*  
   - \*\*Taxpayer Efficiency\*\*:  
     - Redirect 3‚Äì5% of existing budgets from mental health and park maintenance to fund these events, ensuring a responsible use of public funds.  
     - For example, a city with a $2M parks budget could allocate between $60,000 and $100,000 annually to support staffing, supplies, games, and modest prizes.
   - \*\*Community & Nonprofit Collaborations\*\*:  
     - Engage local nonprofits, community groups, and volunteers to contribute supplies and coordinate activities‚Äîkeeping the initiative grassroots and free from overt corporate influence.
     - Partnerships with local artisans or community kitchens can supply food or prizes in a way that underscores communal support rather than market branding.

\*\*3. Safety & Accessibility\*\*  
   - \*\*Discreet, Friendly Security\*\*:  
     - Off-duty police or trained community staff will be present in a non-intrusive manner to ensure everyone‚Äôs safety while preserving a welcoming atmosphere.
   - \*\*Universal Access\*\*:  
     - Venues will be fully ADA-compliant, with clear multilingual signage and dedicated quiet or sensory-friendly zones to cater to all community members.  
     - No registration or ID checks are required, ensuring an open, unguarded environment where everyone feels welcome.

---

### \*\*Addressing Key Concerns\*\*

#### \*\*1. Avoiding Stigma: ‚ÄúFor Everyone, By Everyone‚Äù\*\*  
   - \*\*Neutral Framing\*\*:  
     - Events are marketed simply as ‚ÄúCommunity Hours‚Äù or ‚ÄúNeighbor Days,‚Äù emphasizing collective belonging without labels or therapeutic implications.  
     - Example tagline: \*‚ÄúYour park. Your people. Every Saturday.‚Äù\*  
   - \*\*Voluntary, Enjoyable Participation\*\*:  
     - Attendees are free to join group activities, engage in a friendly game of tug-of-war, or simply enjoy a quiet moment‚Äîensuring that no one feels pressured into interaction.

#### \*\*2. Practical Benefits for Taxpayers\*\*  
   - \*\*Preventive Value\*\*:  
     - Utilizing existing public spaces and resources helps prevent more costly social and health issues by fostering community support networks.  
   - \*\*Community ROI\*\*:  
     - Enhanced face-to-face interactions can lead to new job leads, shared skills, and local volunteer initiatives, ultimately boosting overall community productivity.

#### \*\*3. Realistic Social Dynamics\*\*  
   - \*\*Organic Interaction\*\*:  
     - Whether through casual games, shared meals, or unstructured time in communal seating areas, the design encourages natural, spontaneous connections.  
   - \*\*Overcoming the ‚ÄúStranger Barrier‚Äù\*\*:  
     - The visible presence of others who are seeking similar experiences removes the hesitation often experienced during isolated park visits, building a shared sense of purpose.

#### \*\*4. Digital Detox Incentive\*\*  
   - \*\*A Human-Centric Alternative\*\*:  
     - These Community Hours provide a safe space where real identities, local shared experiences, and tangible interactions replace the superficiality of digital platforms‚Äîhelping reduce overall screen time.

---

### \*\*Expected Outcomes\*\*

#### \*\*Short-Term (6‚Äì12 Months)\*\*  
- \*\*Enhanced Park Utilization\*\*: A projected 30‚Äì40% increase in weekend foot traffic at pilot locations.  
- \*\*Stronger Local Networks\*\*: Surveys may show around 25% of participants exchanging contact information for future meetups or casual play dates.  
- \*\*Reduced Digital Reliance\*\*: Participants might report reducing their daily social media use by 1‚Äì2 hours on average.

#### \*\*Long-Term (3‚Äì5 Years)\*\*  
- \*\*Economic Efficiency\*\*: For every $1 invested, the program is expected to save $3‚Äì4 in reduced healthcare, policing, and social service costs.  
- \*\*Cultural Transformation\*\*: Parks and public spaces evolve into symbols of community vitality and genuine connection rather than areas associated with isolation.  
- \*\*Scalability\*\*: The adaptable model can be tailored‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúFriday Night BBQs‚Äù in rural areas or ‚ÄúUrban Lounge Hours‚Äù in cities‚Äîand replicated across communities nationwide.

---

### \*\*Conclusion: Reclaiming Public Life\*\*  
This initiative is a grounded, realistic response to the challenges of digital isolation and underused public spaces. By leveraging existing community assets and emphasizing organic interaction, Community Hours offer a safe, unbranded environment where genuine human connections can flourish. It‚Äôs not a grand experiment but a return to the fundamentals of social life‚Äîwhere fun games, shared meals, and small rewards create a welcoming space for all.

\*\*Why This Works\*\*:  
- \*\*Low-Cost, High-Impact\*\*: Makes optimal use of existing resources with only modest budgetary adjustments.  
- \*\*Apolitical and Inclusive\*\*: Focuses on universal human needs‚Äîbelonging, safety, and the joy of connection‚Äîwithout commercial influence.  
- \*\*Human-Centric and Realistic\*\*: Emphasizes dignity, choice, and natural social interactions over forced or overly marketed approaches.

---  
\*Proposed by the Office of Civic Engagement & Community Vitality\*  
\*Public feedback is welcome through town halls and online portals.\*

Firstly, the ambience of the place is so warm and vintage with artistic paintings on the wall and nice lighting. I can imagine sitting here on a rainy day just looking outside while drinking coffee. Perfect ambience for group celebration or dates.

Coming to the food, the burger was like the best paneer burger I've ever eaten probably. The paneer was good kind and patty was crispy and flavorful. They put very limited amount of veggies and sauces, which is how I prefer it. The sauce was medium spicy but very tasty. They serve it with coleslaw salad and fries or chips (additional 20RS if taking with fries). The fries were crispy and nice too. I wish they served only burgers separately without any sides for a little lesser price. 

As the place is called PannaKotta, I expected it to have more variety of Pannacotta. Sadly they only had coffee and berries flavours. I got the coffee flavour. The coffee topping was very creamy and had prominent coffee flavour. The pannacotta actually wasn't as jiggly and fluffy as it's supposed to be, so that was a little unexpected. But the taste was sooo good uffff. I wish I could have more of it. 

Overall, it was a very impressive experience both ambience and food taste wise. The staff was very polite and chill. 10/10 experience and would highly recommend to everyone.",4,1743960912.0,kolhapur,2,0.83,False

1jszl7r,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jszl7r/does_it_sound_like_she_might_be_interested_in_me/,Does it sound like she might be interested in me?,"We are in Europe, I (M) am in my mid-20s and she is about five years older. She is universally agreed to be gorgeous in a conventional sense, while I have some striking features (height, facial hair, smile, etc.) but am slightly stocky and consider myself average-looking - although I've worked on myself for some time and feel a lot more confident than when the two of us last met in person. I am also completely inexperienced when it comes to relationships and have only been on a few dates, although I am usually closer to my women friends than male friends.

We've known each other as friends for two years and I lived in her country until last year. We lived on opposite sides of her country and my mental health wasn't great then (which she noticed), so it was a relatively low-level friendship although I did value her company. After I left her country, we kept in touch, but I didn't develop any feelings until we started texting frequently in her language several months ago and really got to know each other. We have always had this kind of playful and witty dynamic when texting while also discussing deep or sensitive things, which is very special to me. We've discussed our romantic preferences as friends in the past - she's single and finally looking again for something long-term (like myself) after a few short-term relationships. Not too surprisingly, she appreciates confidence in men and I get the feeling that intellectual compatibility is also quite important to her; I'm not very stereotypically masculine, and we really connect in this way.

We both work/study in an artistic field, we talk about beauty in art and life a lot, and we sometimes discuss a particular style that leans into a sensual and romantic direction. She is very good at conveying tone in texts - although there has been some tenderness from her side, there was nothing overtly flirty until today, when she reacted to a comment I made about this style with a biting lip emoji. As far as I know, this is as flirty as it gets, but I'm still not sure if it is 100% a sign of interest because she is just a really open person in general; on her very first coffee when we met exclusively as friends, she talked about things that she felt made her ""look sexy"" (when I thanked her for the nice time afterward, she responded that it's ""always nice to make new friends"", which was also my intention back then.)

I really like her both because she matches my intellectual curiosity like nobody else and because she's incredibly attractive, but I have misinterpreted the signs before (I once had a close friend who gave me compliments, called me a sweet person, gave lots of hugs, rested her head on my shoulder, long glances into each other's eyes, etc. and she still said she didn't see me that way when I started to flirt more) and don't want to ruin one of my most profound friendships. Would you say it's likely that she is interested, or am I reading too much into things?

(I should hopefully be in her country again this summer, and we intend to call at some point in the next few weeks when our schedules align, but it would be helpful to have an idea of where things are before then.)",1,1743960830.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1jszezi,https://www.reddit.com/r/AmIOverreacting/comments/1jszezi/aio_my_date_mentioned_his_previous_significantly/,AIO My date mentioned his previous (significantly younger) ex had accused him of grooming?,"I (28M) recently started dating again. Matched  with someone (50M) who is on the older side of my age preferences but we had great conversations and a lot of similar interests so I decided to give meeting up a try.

(For context I am on the autistic spectrum and was online groomed in my teens, I'm currently undergoing a lot of therapy for that and other childhood traumas but am not quite socially/emotionally aware enough to spot red flags still, hence why I'm posting here)

We had a nice date, walked around, got some coffee. Everything else about the date was great - until he mentioned about one of his (most recent) exes and it left a weird feeling in my mouth. I still don't quite know how to feel.

He told me that his previous relationship (5 years ago, so he would've been 45) was with an autistic 19M. He said this was the youngest he's ever dated, and that nothing nefarious happened during the relationship but they'd split after a year or so as it just didn't work out. After their breakup, his ex became homeless (kicked out by family after coming out) and he stayed with said date for a couple months (he says nothing sexual happened, he was just housing a friend). During these months, the 19M ex went through a lot of therapy and told his friends about the relationship he was in, and he was ""convinced by his friends and therapist that he had been groomed, and to cut all contact with (said date)"".

I didnt know how to react. There's a part of me that wants to give him benefit of the doubt, but there's another part of me that's very weirded out by learning this and I don't know who to trust.

He's adamant that he only met his ex when he was of legal age (19), and as he (50m) is also on the autistic spectrum I'm not sure whether that blurs the power dynamic a bit. But from what I could gather it sounded like his 19y/o ex was possibly a lot more autistic (He had stims, meltdowns, etc; Whereas I have high functioning Aspergers so can mask fairly well) so something doesn't sit right with me about the age difference as I have doubts about whether he had the mental capacity of an actual 19 y/o. 

I asked him what was the youngest he'd ever dated and he said that 19 y/o was it. He has had previous relationships with people the same age, or older, or younger - but generally prefers to date younger as he's aged as he cherishes ""child like curiosity"", and that he finds most people his age to be extremely boring.

Just before we parted, he gave me a surprise peck on the lips (which I wasnt expecting but didnt mind as it was short and I may have been giving the wrong signals - I was staring at his beard and facial piercings which may have been interpreted as me looking at his lips) and EVERYONE was watching. Not because we were a same sex couple on a date, but because he looks older for his age and I look Very Young (I'm East Asian and still get ID-ed buying energy drinks) for my age. Im usually too autistic to tell when others are staring, but even I could sense that people were gawking.

Another thing he said which I feel like it may be relevant to mention was that he joked about his friends teasing him for ""always going for broken people"" - That statement by itself may not be insidious (as I also tend to go for people who have gone through trauma or mental health problems as I find it easier as they understand what I'm going through), but in combination with the grooming allegation and the fact that he's lived a relatively trauma-free life himself leaves a weird aftertaste in my mouth.

I don't trust my own radar due to the autism and past traumas, so would be grateful for feedback here. We had a good time, and I genuinely enjoy his company as a friend, but should I reconsider? Is this a potential predator and I'm being naive, or am I just being paranoid due to my past with being groomed?

What do you think? I need some external feedback. If this was your date, how would you make sense of this person from these statements? And What would you advise if you were my friend? Thank you in advance.

Just a few weeks ago, I was drowning in tasks, thinking I was *working hard*, but really, I was just spinning my wheels. If you‚Äôve ever found yourself in the same rut, let‚Äôs chat about a game-changer I discovered: balancing **daily rituals** with **time blocking**. Spoiler alert: it helped me reclaim 10 hours of freedom each week! üéâ

**First off, let's tackle the debate: Rituals vs. Time Blocking.** Which one's better for maximizing productivity? Honestly, it‚Äôs like asking if coffee is better than tea. *Depends on the day*, right? Here‚Äôs a late-night revelation I had while in bunny slippers, sipping chamomile:

1. **Daily Rituals**: They‚Äôre like that cozy morning hug ‚Äì consistent, comforting, and grounding. It's all about small, unshakeable habits that set your day on the right path. For me, it's the holy trinity:
   - Morning stretch.
   - 10-minute meditation.
   - Coffee... lots of coffee. ‚òïÔ∏è

2. **Time Blocking**: Now, this is your knight in shining armor for tackling chaos. It‚Äôs all about allocating specific chunks of time to different activities. My go-to Block System:
   - 9-11 am for deep work (aka, creative zone).
   - Midday for emails (a necessary evil üòÜ).
   - Afternoons for meetings and admin tasks.
   
I hear you asking, *‚ÄúHow did managing these two help you save time?‚Äù* Well, here's the magic trick: **starting small.**

- **Tip #1: Micro Rituals** ‚Äì Hate meditating for 30 minutes? Start with 5. Wanna journal? Aim for 3 sentences. These micro rituals built consistency without the overwhelm. Small win, big impact.
  
- **Tip #2: Flexible Blocks** ‚Äì Instead of rigid schedules, I set loose blocks. Didn‚Äôt finish by noon? No biggie. Flex-time to the rescue! Gives you control, without the anxiety.

But here‚Äôs the kicker, the secret sauce: **I stopped aiming for ‚Äúproductive,‚Äù and started aiming for *mindful*.**

When I shifted focus from ticking boxes to **purposeful actions**, the results were mind-blowing. Less stress, more space to breathe, and believe it or not, more done in less time. Who knew chilling with your intentions had such power?

Anyway, enough about me. How about you, friends? üßê Ever tried balancing rituals with time blocking? Share your stories, struggles, or if you‚Äôre a fellow to-do list survivor, I‚Äôm all ears! Let‚Äôs un-scroll our to-do lists together!",1,1743960238.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

She is universally agreed to be gorgeous in a conventional sense, while I have some striking features (height, facial hair, smile, etc.) but am slightly stocky and consider myself average-looking - although I've worked on myself for some time and feel a lot more confident than when the two of us last met in person. I am also completely inexperienced when it comes to relationships and have only been on a few dates, although I am usually closer to my women friends than male friends.

We've known each other as friends for two years and I lived in her country until last year. We lived on opposite sides of her country and my mental health wasn't great then (which she noticed), so it was a relatively low-level friendship although I did value her company. After I left her country, we kept in touch, but I didn't develop any feelings until we started texting frequently in her language several months ago and really got to know each other. We have always had this kind of playful and witty dynamic when texting while also discussing deep or sensitive things, which is very special to me. We've discussed our romantic preferences as friends in the past - she's single and finally looking again for something long-term (like myself) after a few short-term relationships. Not too surprisingly, she appreciates confidence in men and I get the feeling that intellectual compatibility is also quite important to her; I'm not very stereotypically masculine, and we really connect in this way.

We both work/study in an artistic field, we talk about beauty in art and life a lot, and we sometimes discuss a particular style that leans into a sensual and romantic direction. She is very good at conveying tone in texts - although there has been some tenderness from her side, there was nothing overtly flirty until today, when she reacted to a comment I made about this style with a biting lip emoji. As far as I know, this is as flirty as it gets, but I'm still not sure if it is 100% a sign of interest because she is just a really open person in general; on her very first coffee when we met exclusively as friends, she talked about things that she felt made her ""look sexy"" (when I thanked her for the nice time afterward, she responded that it's ""always nice to make new friends"", which was also my intention back then.)

I really like her both because she matches my intellectual curiosity like nobody else and because she's incredibly attractive, but I have misinterpreted the signs before (I once had a close friend who gave me compliments, called me a sweet person, gave lots of hugs, rested her head on my shoulder, long glances into each other's eyes, etc. and she still said she didn't see me that way when I started to flirt more) and don't want to ruin one of my most profound friendships. Would you say it's likely that she is interested, or am I reading too much into things?

(I should hopefully be in her country again this summer, and we intend to call at some point in the next few weeks when our schedules align, but it would be helpful to have an idea of where things are before then.)",1,1743960096.0,dating,0,1.0,False

PROMASTER BUILD UPDATE:  Today we installed my wife's coffee nook and the kitchen. The coffee nook also serves as a built in cabinet holding the refrigerator. After building all of the cabinets, I assembled soft-closing drawers.  The soft-close feature is nice.  I was also able to add a small drawer under the sink to hold silverware and utensils. I think we will have plenty of drawer space. 

The kitchen sink is pretty large compared to many van builds. It came with a grate in the bottom and a strainer in drain. It also has a grate for the top, if you want to use it to dry your dishes over the sink. It came with a built in cutting board to allow for more counter top space. However, I cut my own from our butcher block countertops so it matches. I am also installing another piece of butcher block that folds up at the end of the sink. This will extend our countertops about 18 inches or so. 

 Our sink faucet swivels to outside of the van. This will allow for an outside shower or to rinse off bikes, wetsuits and other gear as needed.  I think the coffee nook and kitchen turned out great. Can not wait to add in the upper cabinets.

https://youtu.be/uzxlTJs5isE?si=5F1komX8qIbO2hCy\
I remember the first time I realized there were traits of autism I hadn‚Äôt noticed before. Sitting at a coffee shop, I watched a friend methodically arrange their drink before taking a single sip, and it struck me how some habits run much deeper than we think. In this post, I‚Äôll explore 10 hidden traits of autism in adults that many might overlook, including their connection to emotional regulation and social interactions. Understanding these can foster acceptance and support for those on the spectrum. So grab a cup of coffee (if that‚Äôs your routine) and let‚Äôs dive in!\
        \
        Understanding Emotional Regulation and Internal States\
\
Emotional regulation is a complex topic, especially for those on the autism spectrum. Many individuals face a significant challenge when it comes to acknowledging their feelings in the moment. Have you ever felt something but couldn‚Äôt quite put it into words? This experience is common for many people, particularly those with autism.\
\
Difficulty in Acknowledging Feelings\
\
One of the key issues is the difficulty in recognizing and expressing emotions as they happen. Imagine feeling anxious or excited but not being able to articulate those feelings until you‚Äôre alone. This delay can create confusion, both for the individual and those around them.\
\
\
  Many individuals may not express feelings immediately.\
  This can lead to misunderstandings in social situations.\
  It‚Äôs essential to raise awareness about these challenges.\
\
\
The Concept of Alathia\
\
There‚Äôs a term that captures this experience: alathia. It refers to a delayed emotional awareness. This means that someone might not realize what they‚Äôre feeling until much later. For instance, after a stressful event, they might reflect and think, ‚ÄúOh, I was really anxious back then.‚Äù This delay can be frustrating and isolating.\
\
Why does this happen? Emotional awareness varies among individuals on the spectrum. Some may find it easier to identify their feelings, while others struggle significantly. It‚Äôs a spectrum, after all. Understanding this can help us be more compassionate and supportive.\
\
The Challenge of Expressing Emotions in Real-Time\
\
Expressing emotions in real-time can be daunting. Imagine being in a conversation where you feel overwhelmed but can‚Äôt voice that discomfort. It‚Äôs like being trapped in your own mind. This challenge can lead to social awkwardness or misunderstandings.\
\
As I‚Äôve learned, ‚ÄúEmotional regulation is a huge barrier for many on the autistic spectrum.‚Äù This quote resonates deeply with me. It highlights the importance of recognizing these barriers and working towards solutions.\
\
Enhancing Support Through Awareness\
\
Raising awareness about emotional regulation can enhance support for individuals on the autism spectrum. It‚Äôs crucial for friends, family, and society to understand these challenges. By fostering an environment of patience and understanding, we can help those struggling with emotional regulation feel more comfortable expressing themselves.\
\
In conclusion, navigating the emotional landscape can be tricky for many autistic individuals. By acknowledging the difficulties in recognizing and expressing feelings, we can create a more inclusive and supportive environment.Social Routines and Their Impact on Daily Life\
\
Routines play a crucial role in our daily lives. They provide a sense of structure and predictability. For many, a routine is not just a habit; it's a lifeline. This is especially true for individuals on the autism spectrum, who often find comfort in predictability. But why are routines so important for emotional stability?\
\
Importance of Routines for Emotional Stability\
\
Routines help us manage our emotions. When life feels chaotic, having a set schedule can bring a sense of control. Think about it: when you wake up at the same time every day, eat meals at regular intervals, and have a consistent bedtime, it creates a rhythm. This rhythm can be calming. It‚Äôs like a heartbeat for our daily lives.\
\
\
    Routines reduce anxiety.\
    They help in managing stress.\
    They create a safe space for individuals.\
\
\
For autistic individuals, the world can be overwhelming. The predictability of routines can act as a buffer against stressors. It‚Äôs a way to navigate through life‚Äôs unpredictability.\
\
Rigid Adherence to Schedules\
\
Some people stick to their routines rigidly, even when circumstances change. This can be seen as a double-edged sword. On one hand, it provides comfort. On the other, it can lead to frustration if things don‚Äôt go as planned. Have you ever felt thrown off when your schedule is disrupted? It can be disorienting.\
\
Consider this: if you always have coffee at 8 AM and one day it‚Äôs not possible, how does that affect your day? For some, it might just be a minor inconvenience. For others, it could lead to a cascade of stress. This is why understanding the significance of routines is vital.\
\
Examples of Daily Routines and Their Significance\
\
Let‚Äôs look at some common daily routines:\
\
\
    Morning rituals: Waking up, brushing teeth, and having breakfast can set a positive tone for the day.\
    Work schedules: Following a set work routine can enhance productivity and reduce anxiety.\
    Evening wind-down: Activities like reading or meditating can signal to the body that it‚Äôs time to relax.\
\
\
Each of these routines serves a purpose. They help us transition from one part of the day to another. They also provide a sense of accomplishment, which can boost our mood.\
\
In conclusion, routines are more than just habits. They are essential for emotional well-being. Whether rigid or flexible, they help us navigate the complexities of daily life. For many, they truly are a lifeline. So, what routines do you find most comforting? Let‚Äôs share our experiences!Navigating Social Norms and Communication\
\
Understanding social norms can be tricky. For many, the concept of personal space is second nature. But for some, especially those on the autism spectrum, it can feel like a puzzle. How close is too close? When should I step back? These questions can create anxiety in social situations.\
\
Understanding Personal Space\
\
Personal space varies from culture to culture. In some places, standing close is a sign of warmth. In others, it might feel intrusive. For autistic individuals, recognizing these boundaries can be challenging. They might not pick up on subtle cues. This can lead to misunderstandings. Imagine being in a crowded room, feeling overwhelmed by the closeness of others. It's uncomfortable, right?\
\
\
    Awareness: Understanding that personal space is not just about distance but also about comfort.\
    Observation: Watching how others interact can provide clues on how to navigate these situations.\
    Communication: Asking for space or expressing discomfort can be helpful.\
\
\
Using Imitation as a Social Tool\
\
Imitation can be a powerful tool in social settings. Many autistic individuals might mimic the behaviors or speech patterns of others. This can help them fit in. It‚Äôs like wearing a costume to blend into a party. But sometimes, they might not even realize they‚Äôre doing it.\
\
Why do we imitate? It‚Äôs a way to connect. When we see someone laugh, we might laugh too. This shared experience can ease tension. However, it‚Äôs essential to remember that imitation should feel natural, not forced. It‚Äôs about finding a balance.\
\
Challenges with Humor and Sarcasm\
\
Humor can be a minefield. Sarcasm, in particular, is often lost in translation. For many autistic individuals, understanding jokes requires a different lens. They might take things literally, missing the underlying meaning. Have you ever told a joke, only to be met with a blank stare? It can be awkward.\
\
Recognizing humor involves picking up on tone, body language, and context. When these cues are missed, it can lead to confusion. As someone once said, ""Social interactions can feel like a minefield; navigating them takes patience and understanding.""\
\
It‚Äôs vital to approach these challenges with empathy. Each individual has their own social learning path. By being patient and understanding, we can create a more inclusive environment. Remember, it‚Äôs not just about fitting in; it‚Äôs about feeling comfortable in our own skin.\
\
In summary, navigating social norms and communication can be complex. Understanding personal space, using imitation wisely, and grasping humor are all part of the journey. With awareness and practice, we can all improve our social interactions.The Hidden Challenges of Sensory Processing Disorders\
\
Sensory Processing Disorders (SPD) can be a real challenge for many individuals. I‚Äôve seen it firsthand. The sensitivity to sensory stimuli, like textures and temperatures, can create a world of discomfort. Imagine wearing a shirt that feels like sandpaper against your skin. For some, that‚Äôs a daily reality. It‚Äôs not just annoying; it can be overwhelming.\
\
Sensitivity to Sensory Stimuli\
\
People with SPD often react strongly to sensory inputs. This can include:\
\
    Textures: Some may avoid certain fabrics or materials because they feel unbearable.\
    Temperatures: A slight change in temperature can feel extreme. A warm room might feel like a sauna.\
\
\
These sensitivities can lead to significant discomfort. It‚Äôs not just about preference; it‚Äôs about survival. How can someone focus on their day when their clothes are causing distress? It‚Äôs a constant battle.\
\
Daily Impacts on Life and Comfort\
\
Let‚Äôs think about daily life. For someone with SPD, simple tasks can become monumental challenges. Here are a few examples:\
\
    Choosing Clothes: Picking an outfit can take hours. The wrong fabric can lead to a meltdown.\
    Dining Out: The texture of food can be a deal-breaker. A soft, mushy texture might be off-putting, while something crunchy could be delightful.\
    Social Interactions: Being in crowded places can be overwhelming. The noise, the lights, and the smells can create a sensory overload.\
\
\
These challenges can lead to isolation. It‚Äôs hard to enjoy life when the world feels like it‚Äôs closing in. I often wonder, how many people are out there struggling silently with these issues?\
\
Understanding Sensory-Related Behaviors in Public\
\
When we see someone acting differently in public, it‚Äôs easy to judge. But understanding sensory-related behaviors is crucial. For instance, a person may seem withdrawn or anxious. They might avoid eye contact or fidget excessively. This behavior often stems from sensory overload.\
\
Imagine being at a concert. The loud music, bright lights, and crowd can be exhilarating for some. But for others, it‚Äôs a nightmare. They may cover their ears or seek a quiet corner. This isn‚Äôt rudeness; it‚Äôs a coping mechanism.\
\
We need to foster empathy. Understanding these behaviors can help us create a more inclusive environment. Everyone deserves to feel comfortable in their skin, don‚Äôt you think?\
\
In conclusion, sensory processing disorders present hidden challenges that can significantly impact daily life. By recognizing and understanding these issues, we can support those who face them. Let‚Äôs start the conversation and promote awareness.Understanding the Hidden Traits of Autism in Adults\
\
As we delve into the world of autism, it‚Äôs essential to recognize that each individual is unique. While some traits may be common, not everyone on the autism spectrum will exhibit all of them. This exploration aims to shed light on ten hidden traits of autism in adults, helping us foster understanding and acceptance.\
\
1. Difficulty Recognizing Internal States\
One of the first traits is known as Alexia. This term refers to the struggle some adults face in recognizing and expressing their emotions. Imagine feeling anxious or happy, yet being unable to articulate those feelings until you're in a safe space. It‚Äôs a delay in recognizing what‚Äôs happening inside. This can be frustrating, right?\
\
2. Rigid Morality: Black and White Thinking\
Next, we have the concept of black and white thinking. This trait can lead individuals to see situations in extremes. For instance, during a driving awareness course, I found myself grappling with a concept that required nuance. It‚Äôs like trying to understand a joke without getting the punchline. This rigid perspective can make social interactions challenging.\
\
3. Delayed Responses in Conversations\
Have you ever noticed someone taking longer to respond in a conversation? For adults on the autism spectrum, this delay often stems from carefully processing information. They want to ensure accuracy before they speak. Sometimes, they might even text their responses days later. It‚Äôs not about disinterest; it‚Äôs about processing.\
\
4. Attachment to Routines\
Many autistic individuals thrive on routines. These predictable patterns provide comfort. Disrupting them can lead to stress. Think about it: how would you feel if your daily routine suddenly changed? For those on the spectrum, this need for structure is often intensified by co-occurring conditions like OCD.\
\
5. Difficulties with Social Conventions\
Understanding personal space can be tricky. Autistic individuals may not grasp the implicit rules about how close to stand during conversations. This can lead to misunderstandings. It‚Äôs not that they don‚Äôt care; they just see the world differently.\
\
6. Unusual Speaking Patterns\
Many autistic adults experience unique speaking patterns. This can manifest as stuttering or mispronouncing words. The effort of processing thoughts while communicating can be overwhelming. I often reflect on how my speech is influenced by media, despite my background.\
\
7. Exhaustion After Social Events\
Social gatherings can be draining. Many autistic adults experience what I call a ""social hangover."" The overwhelming stimuli can lead to mental fatigue. Recognizing the need for downtime is crucial for well-being.\
\
8. Imitation as a Social Tool\
Imitation can be a strategy for social engagement. Autistic individuals might mimic speech or behaviors to fit in. This behavior highlights the complexities of social interactions they navigate daily.\
\
9. Sensory Processing Issues\
Extreme sensitivity to textures and temperatures is another hidden trait. For example, I struggle with clothing tags and often choose specific fabrics to avoid discomfort. This sensitivity can be a significant aspect of autism, even if it remains hidden.\
\
10. Literal Thinking\
Finally, we have literal thinking. Autistic individuals often interpret language at face value. This can lead to misunderstandings, especially with sarcasm or figurative language. Have you ever taken a joke too literally? It can create awkward moments.\
\
In conclusion, understanding these traits can help us foster a more inclusive environment for autistic individuals. By recognizing their unique experiences, we can promote empathy and support. Let‚Äôs continue the conversation and share our thoughts on these hidden traits. Together, we can make a difference.TL;DR: Autism in adults is often misunderstood due to hidden traits such as emotional regulation issues, rigid morality, and social communication difficulties. This post highlights ten such traits to promote awareness and understanding.\

I was peacefully crying in my coffee, she started nagging because it annoys her that I'm crying so I just let go of some of my current frustrations.

I just poured the rest of my coffee to the sink, cleaned my mug so that I could pack it and fucked off.

Now I'm getting increasingly manipulative messages from my father that I should return, that this is not a solution to problems etc. Good Lawd, I was staying with them for the need of mutual help but at the end, I was the one who did everything wrong, my job was not worthy enough, whatever I did could have been done better.

MESSAGES TRANSCRIPT:



ME: (My initial message about espresso‚Äîwith a photo) 

Built myself a little espresso altar... quad shots and quiet mornings.
Btw...l'm back at the house. Order is still technically in place, just modified enough to exist without drama.
Not repeating patterns. Just making strong coffee annd stronger boundaries.
Also, (coffee shop) totally hits different in memory... but this'll do for now. Just thought l'd share because you're literally the only person I could think of that would appreciate this! Maybe one day I can create some espresso magic for ya! Happy Monday!


HIS RESPONSE: 

I'm sorry that you're choosing this path for yourself. I really wish you the best.
However, it's a decision that I will say is a poor pattern for you. Having said this, I can't say that I can assist you any further in friendship as time goes forward. I hope things pan out for the best and you can have a great life and adventures around the sun while you're in bloom...
Thanks for some fun summer memories and dont stop creating harmonic things ‚úåÔ∏è.

ME (the fire): 

You read what you needed to, not what I said.
I want to be clear here‚ÄîI‚Äôm not back with (ex that sent me to jail) . I‚Äôm back in the house I fought for. A space I legally co-own, after being wrongfully arrested, gaslit, isolated, and discarded. I went back to rebuild, so I can find a way out‚Äînot to repeat. 
But instead of asking, instead of checking in, you assumed the worst of me and wrapped it in some poetic ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù You didn‚Äôt offer concern.
You offered distance dressed as wisdom. 
But let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶
you were looking for an exit.
And my healing gave you one.
I wasn‚Äôt reaching out for help.
I was sharing something simple, human‚Äîa cup of espresso.
A memory. A soft thread back to something that once meant something. And you replied like it was a problem to solve,
like I was the problem again. I loved you‚Ä¶and honestly, in some strange stupid way, I still love you‚Ä¶Not in some clinging,reckless way‚Äîbut in the way a part of me just‚Ä¶stays. 
Because when something real carves its name in you, you don‚Äôt rip it out. You learn to live with the thoughts of what could have been‚Ä¶
But you don‚Äôt get to call yourself my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô in a singular breath and shame me in the next.
I survived what most wouldn‚Äôt. And instead of seeing my strength, you assumed I was back in the trenches. 
That says everything about you.
NOT me. And (FA‚Äôs Name)‚Ä¶
there is no pattern here.
Not the one you projected. 
Not the one you convinced yourself to believe so you could bow out without guilt. Just the story youu keep telling yourself
to avoid facing the truth‚Ä¶that I‚Äôve had the strength to walk away from far worse than your silence.
You didn‚Äôt expect me to survive.
You didn‚Äôt expect me to land on my feet.
Maybe you thought I‚Äôd be stuck, stranded, needing rescue.

But here‚Äôs the reality: 

I didn‚Äôt wait to be saved.
I saved myself. 
So no‚Ä¶
there‚Äôs no pattern here.
Just a woman who keeps rising
while you keep mistaking light for danger.
And next time someone reaches out in tenderness, try listening before you write them off. Because I was never a pattern.

I was a fucking lighthouse.

And just so you know‚Ä¶
the light‚Äôs still shining.
But not for someone who won‚Äôt face it.



ME: (sends prophetic illustration and caption) 


I was going to share this with you anyway‚Ä¶
something I finished yesterday.
Didn‚Äôt realize I was creating a prophecy. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
You, mid-turn‚Ä¶Me, still rooted.
Blindfolds, sure‚Äîbut the thread stayed lit‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs funny how art knows before we do thought you‚Äôd recognize the silhouette‚Ä¶

P.S. Next time I predict your exit, I‚Äôll add a disco ball and make it festive. üíÖ 



BACKGROUND:

We had a soulmate-level connection‚Äîmagnetic, creative, spiritual‚Ä¶ but unstable toward the end. I was anxiously attached, and he was a classic FA.
He loved deeply, then disappeared when things got too real.
It hurt like hell.
And honestly? It still hurt a year later.

After the breakup, I entered another relationship‚Äîone that mirrored my unhealed trauma. That partner ended up hitting me and wrongfully sending me to jail in an attempt to control me and take over the house we co-own. I lost my freedom, my housing, and‚Äîbriefly‚Äîmyself.

Then out of nowhere‚Ä¶ my ex showed up.
He spent four hours trying to get me out of jail.
That moment? That‚Äôs when I knew: he still loved me.

A few days later, I came across his old shirt‚Äîone we had both been searching for for over a year.
I found it at my dad‚Äôs house the day after I got out.
It felt like a sign.

I let him know I had it, thinking it‚Äôd be a quick ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your shirt and a book‚Äù goodbye.
But when he pulled up, he said:

‚ÄúGet in.‚Äù

I did.
And he took me to a creative studio he‚Äôs building‚Äîone we once dreamed of together.
I gave him the shirt and a signed copy of Yung Pueblo‚Äôs new book ‚ÄòHow to Love Better‚Äô.
He told me I deserved more.
That I shouldn‚Äôt go back to the house.
That maybe I could get a roommate.

I told him I legally co-own it, and that with my legal status post-jail, it‚Äôs the only place I can live and work safely.
Otherwise I lose everything I‚Äôve worked hard for.
He didn‚Äôt understand.
But in that moment‚Äîin his arms‚Äîit felt like home again.
Like something between us still hadn‚Äôt settled.
And when is it ever finished with an FA?

This one had never forgotten me. I had pierced through his defenses in a way no one else had.

But later, after finding out I was back in the house (without asking why), he ghosted.
No conversation.
No check-in.
Just a poetic ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù

But this time?

I didn‚Äôt collapse. I didn‚Äôt spiral. I didn‚Äôt beg.

I responded.
With full clarity. Full heart. Full self.

And I told him‚Äîwithout any pleading‚Äîthat I still loved him.

That line took immense courage.
To love someone and still hold your ground‚Ä¶that was the shift I never thought I‚Äôd reach a year ago.

I also sent him a digital art piece I had finished the night before he sent the goodbye.
I had no idea what I was illustrating at the time.

Two blindfolded figures.
His silhouette mid-turn.
Mine rooted, steady, still glowing.
Still tethered by light.
It was a prophecy. Or something close to it.

My art knew before I did.

If you‚Äôre healing your attachment style, or navigating a painful breakup this is for you:

You can still love someone and not abandon yourself.
You can express your heart without losing your footing.
You can be soft and powerful at the same time.
And remember YOU are the fucking lighthouse!

The coffee nook also serves as a built in cabinet holding the refrigerator. After building all of the cabinets, I assembled soft-closing drawers.  The soft-close feature is nice.  I was also able to add a small drawer under the sink to hold silverware and utensils. I think we will have plenty of drawer space. 

The kitchen sink is pretty large compared to many van builds. It came with a grate in the bottom and a strainer in drain. It also has a grate for the top, if you want to use it to dry your dishes over the sink. It came with a built in cutting board to allow for more countertop space. However, I cut my own from our butcher block countertops so it matches. I am also installing another piece of butcher block that folds up at the end of the sink. This will extend our countertops about 18 inches or so. 

 Our sink faucet swivels to the outside of the van. This will allow for an outside shower or to rinse off bikes, wetsuits and other gear as needed.

1jsz7p8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1jsz7p8/i_am_a_priest_in_newfoundland_there_is_something/,"I am a priest in Newfoundland, there is something sinister here","It would be a lie to say I grew up wanting to be a priest. My father would take my sisters and me to church every Sunday, whether it was snowing or blisteringly hot, we always went. While my sisters were off finding their husbands, I was growing in the faith and spent more time praying than socializing. However, I was still hesitant when my father told me I should attend a seminary school after graduation. It was not exactly the most thrilling prospect as a seventeen-year-old kid, but after some thought that summer, I decided to give it a shot. It would be the best and worst decision of my life.



Once I was fully ordained, I was dispatched to a corner of the globe that had drifted away from the church. I ended up in a town on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland called Blythe. It was a small, isolated fishing town whose main claim to fame was the rumored existence of a nearby Viking landing site. I knew it was my calling when I learned it had previously been host to a catholic church. However, after it burned down in the early 1800s with the priest inside, there was never any attempt to rebuild it.



On my first visit to Blythe, I found the remains of the old church buried deep in the woods outside of town. There was barely anything left besides the cellar and some large logs still blackened by flames. It would be easy to clear the rubble and build my new church atop where the old one once stood. Luckily I was given sufficient funds by the Vatican for this undertaking.¬†



The locals were leery of me initially since not many outsiders came through their neck of the woods. On this first visit, I tried my best to introduce myself to as many people as possible, but sadly, my trip ended before I could make any real progress. I did, however, pay a group of workers to begin constructing the new church before I left.¬†



On my second trip, the locals were more receptive to my presence. Several people approached me, asking about the church, faith, and me personally. Frankly, I wasn‚Äôt expecting this kind of reception after my last visit, but there was one encounter that stood out.¬†



I was visiting the construction site. The sun was getting low and the workers were packing up for the day. Most of the framing had been done and I took great pleasure walking through the hollow interior imagining what it would look like finished. That was when one of the workers approached me.

	

‚ÄúExcuse me, Father?‚Äù He asked, taking off his hard hat.



‚ÄúYes?‚Äù



I would come to find out his name was Johnathan Heathstead. He stood there and scratched his head like he wasn‚Äôt sure what to say next.



‚ÄúDo you‚Ä¶Do you believe in demons?‚Äù He asked.



‚ÄúYes, I sure do.‚Äù



‚ÄúBut do you *believe* in them?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre asking,‚Äù I said.



Johnathan paused for a long second before speaking.



‚ÄúNever mind.‚Äù



At the time, I didn‚Äôt think too much about this interaction. Looking back I should have.¬†



On my third visit, I brought two suitcases and my cat Spots. I was finally moving to Blythe. The church was finished, at least as finished as a church in the backcountry could be. I was proud of it. I was so excited that I opened the doors to all visitors that first day. I was already greeting nearly two dozen people before I even had a chance to unpack. While that might not seem like many, every pew was filled in that small church.



There was one man, however, who wasn‚Äôt sitting. He was standing in the back watching me as I gave my little sermon and invited the crowd to attend that Sunday‚Äôs mass. After everyone filed out, he approached me.



It was Johnathan. I could hardly recognize him. He looked tired, with dark bags under his eyes and a long, disheveled beard. His clothes looked two sizes too big and it took me a moment to recognize they were the same clothes he was wearing the day I had met him.¬†



‚ÄúFather,‚Äù He croaked, his voice harsh and dry, ‚ÄúDo you have a moment?‚Äù



I paused, unsure how to react.



‚ÄúI need help,‚Äù he said with tears welling in his eyes.



While I was ready to listen to him talk about losing a loved one or going through a nasty divorce, I wasn‚Äôt ready for what he ended up saying. I ushered him to the first row of pews and we sat for a few minutes before he started talking.



‚ÄúFather‚Ä¶Do you believe in the Devil?‚Äù He asked.



‚ÄúYes of course.‚Äù



‚ÄúDo you believe he walks among us?‚Äù



‚ÄúSadly I do. He exists in the hearts of men everywhere.‚Äù



Johnathan paused, more tears spilling down his cheeks. I became acutely aware of the smell of fresh lumber at that moment. Strange what you notice in the silence between words.



‚ÄúI believe the Devil has his grip on me,‚Äù he whispered.



‚ÄúWhat makes you think that, my child?‚Äù



Johnathan took a long, steadying breath before he spoke again.



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why, but I‚Äôve started to‚Ä¶do things.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat things?‚Äù I pressed.



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I black out sometimes. Sometimes only for a few minutes, but other times for whole days. When I wake up‚Ä¶When I wake I‚Ä¶Sometimes I come to and I‚Äôm waist-deep in the ocean on the brink of the abyss. Others‚Ä¶others I am bare-chested and covered in b-blood. Normally I am outside, on a rock, or up a tree. But, sometimes I am in the basement of my house scribbling like a madman with chalk and blood.‚Äù	



‚ÄúWhose blood is it?‚Äù	



‚ÄúI-I-I don‚Äôt know. Sometimes I swear it is fish blood, others I am not too sure. Our dog went missing a few weeks ago‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know.‚Äù



Johnathan broke down. Sobbing into his hands. I noticed they were slightly stained red.¬†



‚ÄúFather, I need help. Please!‚Äù



Now, the Church has had controversy with mental illnesses being conflated with possession, so to say I wasn‚Äôt exactly reaching for my cross and Bible over what this man was telling me would be an understatement.¬†



‚ÄúLet me consult with my superiors,‚Äù I said, patting him on the back, ‚Äúthey will surely know what the best course of action is.‚Äù



‚ÄúFather, I need help now!‚Äù



‚ÄúYes I know, but I am limited in what I can do right now.‚Äù



Johnathan‚Äôs face immediately sobered up and a flash of rage shined in his eyes. Tears still rolled down his cheeks as he stood up and stormed out of the church.¬†



‚ÄúGo in peace!‚Äù I called out after him, ‚ÄúGod protects all of his children and gives us strength!‚Äù



Johnathan paused halfway through the door and turned back to me.



‚ÄúThen I am no child of God,‚Äù He said before slamming the door shut.



I sat in the empty church for a while, considering what had just happened. My welcome to the town had gone smoothly so far but I was afraid, after how that confession went, that I might not be up to the task. Spots jumped up on my lap and started purring. It put me at ease and the rest of the evening went smoothly.



I had no way of knowing that that night, Johnathan would enter his basement and never emerge again.¬†



It was a closed-casket funeral. A small, intimate affair even though I am sure half the town showed up. It was there that I met Marie, Johnathan‚Äôs widow. A few days after the funeral, I decided to stop by the new widow‚Äôs home. I didn‚Äôt feel it was appropriate to crowd around her at the funeral or to simply ignore her. My motivation wasn‚Äôt entirely altruistic, a selfish part of me wished to wash my hands of the guilt that had weighed on me since I got the news.¬†



When Marie answered the door, it was obvious she‚Äôd been crying. Her eyes were red and puffy and her nose was almost rubbed raw.



‚ÄúGood evening Father, what can I do for you?‚Äù She asked.



‚ÄúI just wanted to stop by and offer my condolences,‚Äù I said.



She opened her mouth and closed it several times.



‚ÄúWould you like to come in?‚Äù She said, biting back tears, ‚ÄúI would appreciate some guidance.‚Äù



Marie led me inside to a small, two-person dining table in the kitchen.¬†



‚ÄúCoffee?‚Äù She asked.



‚ÄúThat would be great.‚Äù



Her hands were shaking as she grabbed two mugs from the cupboard.¬†



‚ÄúFather,‚Äù she started, ‚Äúdo you believe in demons?‚Äù



Now, I like to believe I am a rational man, but I would be lying if I said that question didn‚Äôt immediately make me feel sick to my stomach.



‚ÄúYes, of course.‚Äù



‚ÄúCan they make a sane man do what Johnny did?‚Äù She asked, placing the mug of old coffee in front of me before sinking into the opposite chair.



‚ÄúWhat did Johnathan do?‚Äù



‚ÄúI-I don‚Äôt know. He told me he was having nightmares but I didn‚Äôt think they were all that serious. I mean who would? What was I supposed to do?‚Äù



‚ÄúMy child,‚Äù I placed my hand on her wrist, ‚Äúwhat did Johnathan do?‚Äù



Marie wiped at her nose and looked at the basement door.



‚ÄúHe came home late and he was sweating like crazy. I got him water and he seemed to settle down. We went to bed and‚Ä¶and‚Ä¶‚Äù she broke down but quickly composed herself, ‚ÄúI found him down there that morning. The sheriff took his body and some photos but it was clear it was self-inflicted. The door was locked from the inside. He told me I get to be the one to clean it up but I haven‚Äôt opened that door since that morning.‚Äù	



‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhy, Father, why did this happen?‚Äù



‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù



‚ÄúWhat should I do?‚Äù



‚ÄúI‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt know,‚Äù I sheepishly said.



Marie stood up and walked over to the window.



‚ÄúYou haven‚Äôt touched the basement?‚Äù I asked.



‚ÄúNo. No, not yet.‚Äù



‚ÄúLet me help, it‚Äôs the least I can do.‚Äù



Marie led me to the basement door. She didn‚Äôt open it, only nodding towards the doorknob before shuffling back to the dining table.¬†



The door whined as it swung open revealing nothing but a curtain of darkness just past the threshold. A distinct metal tinge hung in the air and stuck on my tongue. I rolled up my sleeves and whispered a quick prayer. Each step creaked as I descended into the darkness. I didn‚Äôt know what to expect but it wasn‚Äôt what was down there.¬†



I pulled on the light cord. It was an unfinished basement with low beam ceilings and concrete floors, a desk was pushed to the side with a rug rolled up and stored on top. It made a clearing in the middle of the basement.¬†



It was red‚Äîred everywhere‚Äîstreaks and drops, smears across the floors and on the walls. A tinge of rusting iron hung in the air. Among the streaks, there were broken fingernails and scraps of skin. It made me feel weak.



At first, there was no pattern to the madness. Just intersecting lines and circles, hard angles, and jagged scribbling. My head was spinning and I stumbled back to the stairs. I sat for a while, staring at the self-inflicted carnage when it finally started to form.



It was a single, massive rune, or at least something like a rune. It was surprisingly intricate, with large smears making up the border with smaller drops and streaks for finer details. I took several pictures of the rune from every possible angle. I didn‚Äôt know what I would do but I still felt I should document it. It took a few hours to clean up the blood. Even after cleaning, the floor was still stained red.¬†



‚ÄúGod be with you,‚Äù I said standing on the house's front step, ‚Äúit always gets better with time.‚Äù



Marie didn‚Äôt say anything as she slowly closed the door.¬†



Several months passed and I had settled into a routine. The buzz around the new church had died down and there was regular attendance during mass. While it wasn‚Äôt the most exciting place to be, Blythe and the surrounding countryside had started to grow on me. With the coming of fall and the changing of leaves, I found myself outside more and more.¬†



The forests behind the church could have well been endless. The locals had carved hiking paths through the trees and several fallen logs made excellent benches. I hadn‚Äôt seen or heard anything about Marie since I visited her house that night. Rumor was that she had secluded herself and was living as a hermit, barely leaving her house. Who could blame her?



Since that night, I haven‚Äôt looked at the photos I took. There was no need to; they were seared into my memory. I thought about that night regularly on my walks through the woods. There was one tree that was my turning point for my walks. Rumor has it that it was a lone survivor of the region's old-growth forest. I say this as a man of God; I understand why ancient peoples believed these great things to be gods themselves.



It was after one of these hikes that I found a note folded up and slid under the door. It was written in handwriting so heavy it pierced the page a few times. It simply read:¬†



*Help.*



While it was a bit of a stretch, I presumed the note was from Marie. After all, who else would it have been from? She just needed help after Johnathan passed away. Oh how wrong I was. It was getting late but I made the trek out to her house that night. The house sat on the outskirts of town overlooking the ocean.¬†



Once I reached the front door, the sun had already set and the insects had started singing their tunes. I was about to knock when I realized the door was already open.



‚ÄúMrs. Heathstead?‚Äù I called out.



Nothing but the darkness of the house answered. The door let out a low creak as I pushed it open.



‚ÄúMrs. Heathstead? Are you here?‚Äù	No response.	



I stepped inside, the floorboards moaning under my feet.¬†



‚ÄúMrs Heathstead are you there?‚Äù¬†



I was about to turn back when I heard a faint sobbing coming from the basement. The basement door was slightly ajar, inky darkness on the other side. I took a step closer. The sobbing suddenly stopped.¬†



I heard whispering coming from the basement.



‚ÄúWhat did you say? Mrs. Heathstead?‚Äù



The voice that responded was raspy and almost indiscernibly quiet.



‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a man at the top of the stairs.‚Äù



I took a step closer, my heart pumping in my ears as the voice spoke again.



‚ÄúAnd another in the basement.‚Äù



Screaming echoed from the basement. The inky darkness was dispelled as orange flames burst from the basement. I fell back, barely avoiding a burst of flames that licked at the place I was just standing. Scrambling to my feet, I barely got out of the doorway before the door slammed shut. By what force I don‚Äôt know.



It was only for the briefest of moments, but for a second I thought something was staring at me from the window. As I blinked the windows exploded in flames sending shards of glass flying in every direction.



The Heathstead house burned down in less than 5 minutes. It took nearly double that for the first men carrying hoses to respond. I stared at the flames, my clothes and hair singed.¬† The flames swirled and licked the night sky.



The Sheriff seemed just as confused and disturbed as I was when I gave my statement. Whether this was because he believed me or didn‚Äôt, I don‚Äôt know. I was still an outsider after all. A couple died so soon after I arrived. Even the most trusting man would be suspicious.



It was eventually ruled as self-inflicted. It is easier to believe that a grief-stricken widow would choose to end her pain than for it to be the work of the devil.



I don‚Äôt know what I saw in that window. If I saw anything in that window. I like to believe I am a reasonable man as much as I am a holy one. But after that night, I find myself struggling for answers.



All I know is the devil is real, and I fear he is here in Newfoundland.

I have a bright future in a career that I am passionate about. I have a caring family that will always have my back and support. Although of few friends, those that I have are very close and trustworthy. However, for most of my life, there is something that I have lacked. I am not just talking about love. Rather, I am talking about simply having someone.

¬†

Someone to walk through life with. Someone to carve through the intricacies of living with. Someone to support and be supported by. Someone to talk about my day with, and who tells me about theirs in turn. Someone with whom I can share my pains and joys, and who shares their victories and defeats with me as well.

¬†

I am not looking for my soulmate. I am not looking for the perfect woman either. I am looking for a friend, a partner who will always be there for me, as I will be there for her. I am looking for someone to get to know all about, step by step, until we decide to commit to one another, and beyond. If any of this resonates with you, please keep reading.

¬†

**----- About me -----**

¬†

I am a 32 years-old guy from Chile. I am 185 centimeters tall, with an average bulk. I am black-haired and brown-eyed. I have been told that I have a cute face and great hands. While I do not exercise often, I take proper care of my health. I speak both Spanish and English fluently. I am involved in the computer science field, something that I am pretty passionate about. Some of my hobbies are watching anime/series and playing video games.

¬†

As you can guess from those hobbies, I am mostly a homebody with nerdy interests. However, I enjoy doing several other things as well, especially if it is with the right person. Going out on walks, visiting new coffee shops, going to the cinema and any other relaxing date plans are enjoyable to me. Traveling around the world and learning about many different cultures is also something that drives me.

¬†

My personality type is INTJ-A. I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. I am also pretty structured and like to manage all kinds of things around me. When I am passionate about something, I give it my all. I am probably a little too honest. I take pride in being a respectful person who values equality among all people.

¬†

I am not fond of extreme political views from either side of the spectrum. While I was raised in a Catholic household and I strongly believe in God, nowadays I follow my faith in my own way. I do not drink or smoke.

¬†

Like all human beings, I am not perfect. Although I believe that I deal with it rather well, I have a shy personality. While I can be introverted and like to spend some time charging myself up sometimes, I also get rather clingy with my partner so I will be looking out for you even during those times. I am also rather inquisitive as a partner and like being the one who leads in the relationship, which I understand might not be for everyone, but I believe that I should be upfront about it. I like having a say in my partner‚Äôs decisions. I am not the kind of guy who would mistreat you, though. Just know that even while being in charge, I strongly value my partner‚Äôs opinions and what drives me is to guide her to be someone successful. I also have an above-average libido and a rather open mind when it comes to sexual topics, but it is not something that I would like to prioritize at first with this post. I am simply opting to be as honest as possible with everything that could be a deal-breaker.

¬†

**----- Who I am looking for -----**

¬†

While sharing many of the characteristics that I will describe would possibly mean a higher chance for compatibility, please know that I am not looking for someone who fits this description perfectly. Rather, I value someone who is aware of our differences and is willing to find a middle ground whenever we do not agree with something. Communication is what is key here. Being honest and not keeping things to ourselves is something that I consider very important.

¬†

I will reiterate that communication is important. I hope that my partner also values talking regularly and getting to know each other to the best of our capabilities. I will do my best to keep the conversation ongoing and I hope you will do the same. To me, asking about how each other‚Äôs day is going is something valuable. I do understand that work, studies, and other things will sometimes keep either of us busy.

¬†

I would prefer my partner to be a few years younger than me, but I will not provide a specific age range as what matters to me is chemistry and having similar goals. While I care more about these things and emotional attraction, I must mention that I do have a preference for girls with a healthy BMI who are a little bit shorter than me. To avoid wasting each other‚Äôs time, please be willing to exchange selfies once we start talking or before we decide to go further than friendship to see if there is enough physical attraction. I am happy with any ethnicity or race. I do not have a problem with what your religion is, either. I am more than happy to learn about your culture and to find ways to close any possible gaps between our different backgrounds.

¬†

I hope that you are passionate about your path in life. You will have all my support in becoming someone successful. As for hobbies, you do not need to share the same hobbies as me, but a willingness from both of us to learn about the other‚Äôs hobbies would be nice. I would prefer it if you are either a homebody or prefer more relaxing activities, as going to clubs is not too appealing to me. Going to bars from time to time is alright.

¬†

Please be upfront about yourself and your life situation. I am not looking for a perfect person, so I wish to learn about both your good and bad sides. While I hope to be given the lead and be relied upon to some degree, I hope just as much that you have your own opinion on all kinds of topics and talk with me about your different views on whatever comes our way. Please be open to talking about our sexual desires when the time comes, too. I reiterate that this would be a topic for once we have been together for some time and gone beyond friendship.

¬†

**----- Logistics -----**

¬†

I want to be clear that I am looking to eventually form a long-term relationship that will most likely start online, but that ultimately leads to an in-person commitment with the hope that it will last for a lifetime. I like some traditional values, such as forming a tight, supportive family and taking the lead but, at the same time, I want my partner to feel successful and right next to me in this venture, so let us split both the chores and bills even if neither is half and half. I would like to have around two children, ideally before I am 40. I would also be happy to have a pair of cats and perhaps other pets. Please be open to eventually discussing topics like these.

¬†

Regarding the eventual relocation, due to my career, I may be moving in the short-term future from my country, which may make things easier, but I hope that you are also willing to relocate and find the best way for us to be together. While I will not provide a rock-solid timeframe, perhaps meeting within 6-9 months after we decide to commit to each other is reasonable. If everything goes well, we could possibly decide about relocating within 1 and a half or 2 years. Of course, that will depend on our life situation. For example, if you are studying, I can wait for you to finish your studies and visit you as time and money allow.

¬†

This is the third version of this post and I think I managed to cover the most important things. There is one change that I would like to highlight in comparison to older versions. Although things have not worked out, I have gotten to talk with a few nice people so far. These experiences have shown me that going too fast places too much of a burden on either or both sides, which is why I am now explicitly mentioning friendship in the post. The goal is definitely to eventually form a long-term relationship, but I believe that it would be best to first get to know each other as friends, as being friends is a key part of any good relationship. If things do not work out romantically, we can always evaluate whether we want to stay in touch as friends. Of course, I would hope that things actually work out.

¬†

As you can see, I write a lot. Thank you for reading this far! Feel free to message me if you think that we would be a good match. I am posting this in several subs, so please tell me where you found it, and what caught your eye about it! A brief description of yourself would also be nice.

Some of my hobbies are watching anime/series and playing video games.

¬†

As you can guess from those hobbies, I am mostly a homebody with nerdy interests. However, I enjoy doing several other things as well, especially if it is with the right person. Going out on walks, visiting new coffee shops, going to the cinema and any other relaxing date plans are enjoyable to me. Traveling around the world and learning about many different cultures is also something that drives me.

¬†

My personality type is INTJ-A. I am a naturally curious person, so expect me to inquire often about all kinds of things. I am also pretty structured and like to manage all kinds of things around me. When I am passionate about something, I give it my all. I am probably a little too honest. I take pride in being a respectful person who values equality among all people.

¬†

I am not fond of extreme political views from either side of the spectrum. While I was raised in a Catholic household and I strongly believe in God, nowadays I follow my faith in my own way. I do not drink or smoke.

¬†

Like all human beings, I am not perfect. Although I believe that I deal with it rather well, I have a shy personality. While I can be introverted and like to spend some time charging myself up sometimes, I also get rather clingy with my partner so I will be looking out for you even during those times. I am also rather inquisitive as a partner and like being the one who leads in the relationship, which I understand might not be for everyone, but I believe that I should be upfront about it. I like having a say in my partner‚Äôs decisions. I am not the kind of guy who would mistreat you, though. Just know that even while being in charge, I strongly value my partner‚Äôs opinions and what drives me is to guide her to be someone successful. I also have an above-average libido and a rather open mind when it comes to sexual topics, but it is not something that I would like to prioritize at first with this post. I am simply opting to be as honest as possible with everything that could be a deal-breaker.

**----- Who I am looking for -----**

¬†

While sharing many of the characteristics that I will describe would possibly mean a higher chance for compatibility, please know that I am not looking for someone who fits this description perfectly. Rather, I value someone who is aware of our differences and is willing to find a middle ground whenever we do not agree with something. Communication is what is key here. Being honest and not keeping things to ourselves is something that I consider very important.

¬†

I will reiterate that communication is important. I hope that my partner also values talking regularly and getting to know each other to the best of our capabilities. I will do my best to keep the conversation ongoing and I hope you will do the same. To me, asking about how each other‚Äôs day is going is something valuable. I do understand that work, studies, and other things will sometimes keep either of us busy.

¬†

I would prefer my partner to be a few years younger than me, but I will not provide a specific age range as what matters to me is chemistry and having similar goals. While I care more about these things and emotional attraction, I must mention that I do have a preference for girls with a healthy BMI who are a little bit shorter than me. To avoid wasting each other‚Äôs time, please be willing to exchange selfies once we start talking or before we decide to go further than friendship to see if there is enough physical attraction. I am happy with any ethnicity or race. I do not have a problem with what your religion is, either. I am more than happy to learn about your culture and to find ways to close any possible gaps between our different backgrounds.

¬†

I hope that you are passionate about your path in life. You will have all my support in becoming someone successful. As for hobbies, you do not need to share the same hobbies as me, but a willingness from both of us to learn about the other‚Äôs hobbies would be nice. I would prefer it if you are either a homebody or prefer more relaxing activities, as going to clubs is not too appealing to me. Going to bars from time to time is alright.

¬†

Please be upfront about yourself and your life situation. I am not looking for a perfect person, so I wish to learn about both your good and bad sides. While I hope to be given the lead and be relied upon to some degree, I hope just as much that you have your own opinion on all kinds of topics and talk with me about your different views on whatever comes our way. Please be open to talking about our sexual desires when the time comes, too. I reiterate that this would be a topic for once we have been together for some time and gone beyond friendship.

¬†

**----- Logistics -----**

¬†

I want to be clear that I am looking to eventually form a long-term relationship that will most likely start online, but that ultimately leads to an in-person commitment with the hope that it will last for a lifetime. I like some traditional values, such as forming a tight, supportive family and taking the lead but, at the same time, I want my partner to feel successful and right next to me in this venture, so let us split both the chores and bills even if neither is half and half. I would like to have around two children, ideally before I am 40. I would also be happy to have a pair of cats and perhaps other pets. Please be open to eventually discussing topics like these.

¬†

Regarding the eventual relocation, due to my career, I may be moving in the short-term future from my country, which may make things easier, but I hope that you are also willing to relocate and find the best way for us to be together. While I will not provide a rock-solid timeframe, perhaps meeting within 6-9 months after we decide to commit to each other is reasonable. If everything goes well, we could possibly decide about relocating within 1 and a half or 2 years. Of course, that will depend on our life situation. For example, if you are studying, I can wait for you to finish your studies and visit you as time and money allow.

¬†

This is the third version of this post and I think I managed to cover the most important things. There is one change that I would like to highlight in comparison to older versions. Although things have not worked out, I have gotten to talk with a few nice people so far. These experiences have shown me that going too fast places too much of a burden on either or both sides, which is why I am now explicitly mentioning friendship in the post. The goal is definitely to eventually form a long-term relationship, but I believe that it would be best to first get to know each other as friends, as being friends is a key part of any good relationship. If things do not work out romantically, we can always evaluate whether we want to stay in touch as friends. Of course, I would hope that things actually work out.

Talking myself out of anxiety about it also helped them go away. 

Suddenly, they've felt different and have been in a much different frequency. I used to have the double beat and then slow down. This would be like once a day once a week. Now, for the past week, when feeling my pulse, my heart stops beating for 2-3 seconds and starts again. I noticed this mostly being when I am standing or sitting up and sometimes walking. They are now everyday, every hour. My caffeine intake was usually normal (one coffee or redbull a day). 
I stopped drinking caffeine Thursday night and started taking magnesium. The magnesium made them a little less strong but they still happen. I've been taking iron as well. 
I had a singular cigarette Saturday the week prior and am worried it was that (i vaped previously but had quit for a few years). I am also starting my menstrual cycle soon but it has not happened yet.

I'd consider myself introspective. I like to mull over the human condition and take an interest in different schools of thought and philosophy as well as history and politics

I spend most of my free time watching films (classic, fantasy, horror, psych, and so on), reading the occasional book (mostly classic, fantasy, horror and psych) at any given coffee shop, and playing video games (horror, fantasy, and soulsborne). I also enjoy hiking and visiting anything historical

The most interesting thing is, I went on a little Manhattan Dak binge a few months ago and generally those coffees did not need a long drawdown time, I would make sure to get a fast drawdown and there would just be clarity and sweetness waiting for me.

This new bag is so weird, because every time I get a fast draw time, it feels like the beans are super astringent. lol I‚Äôm getting bitterness this odd burnt bitterness and I don‚Äôt know where from. So today, I said fuck it, and did a super agitation brew. Wet WDT, swirling after the second pour. Swirling at the end. Drawdown of course took a minute more and oddly, all that astringent nature went away. 

Reading this, you may be like, oh he was just under extracting before this. Well, I did a specifically ‚Äúover extracted‚Äù low agitation brew in which I made sure fine migration was low and drawdown time was fast at a super fine grind level. It‚Äôs not hard to do but it‚Äôs definitely a lot of intervening on my side. I have to be careful in the bloom and the pours to keep all the fines on the side. And I got the same thing, fast drawdown but astringent cup. Bitter in a not good way, burnt tannins etc. 

Now this is crazy to me. To see that extraction through fine grind size gives you a different extraction compared to a slower drawdown time. But what‚Äôs even crazier is that the Manhattan didn‚Äôt like the slow drawdown time but this one does. Mind blown. I mean you can really see how much there is to learn even after brewing for a few years. 

My main question also was, is this was people struggle with ZP6? Essentially, my grinder the jx-pro does generate a good amount of fines but is completely manageable if you know the right grind size and slow feed the grinder. The ZP6 produces very little fines so now I think after this experience, I have a theory why the ZP6 may give people hollow under extracted cups of over extracted cups and they can‚Äôt find that sweet spot. I think the ZP6 may require an intervention from the user to artificially increase drawdown time to reduce unnecessary astringency from a short brew time.

Further evidence which led me to this theory was the world brewer cup video saying that a fast drawdown time may lead to astringency. She even used the word density in her video which is why I think the variation in between beans to a fast drawdown time makes sense. I want to know what y‚Äôall think and just comment a bunch of info. Everything you know about the subject and anecdotal experience.",4,1743959407.0,pourover,3,1.0,False

**Trail warriors, listen up!** After guiding countless clients through mental preparation for demanding hikes, I've discovered that proper nutrition is just as crucial for the mind as it is for the body. When you're pushing your limits on challenging terrain, what you eat becomes the difference between conquering that mountain and hitting the dreaded energy wall.

## The Nutrition Trifecta for Peak Trail Performance

Your body requires three essential macronutrients to maintain optimal energy levels during strenuous hiking:

* **Carbohydrates** - Your quick-burn fuel for immediate energy needs
* **Protein** - Essential for muscle maintenance and recovery
* **Healthy Fats** - Your body's long-burning energy reserve

Think of these as the three stages of your campfire: kindling for quick heat (carbs), logs for steady burning (protein), and embers for lasting warmth (fats).

## Food Selection Strategy by Trip Length

| Trip Duration | Daily Food Weight | Daily Caloric Needs | Planning Tips |
|:--------------|:------------------|:--------------------|:--------------|
| Short (1-3 days) | 1.5-2 lbs | 2,500-3,500 calories | Fresh food acceptable, fewer backups needed |
| Medium (4-7 days) | 2-2.5 lbs | 3,000-4,000 calories | Mix of fresh and shelf-stable options |
| Extended (7+ days) | 2.5-3 lbs | 3,500-4,500 calories | Focus on lightweight, calorie-dense foods |

*Always pack one extra day's worth of food for emergencies!*

## The Cold-Soak vs. Hot Meal Debate

This fundamental choice affects your entire trail experience:

**Cold-Soaking Benefits:**
* Lighter pack weight (no stove/fuel)
* Zero fire risk in sensitive areas
* Simplicity - just add water and wait

**Hot Meal Advantages:**
* Faster food rehydration
* Psychological comfort of warm food
* Broader meal options (including coffee!)
* Better nutrient absorption

Your trail persona and hiking conditions should guide this choice. Many experienced hikers find that hot meals provide psychological comfort that enhances mental stamina during challenging sections.

## Superfoods That Supercharge Your Hike

These nutritional powerhouses deliver maximum benefit for minimal weight:

1. **Nut butters** - Concentrated calories and healthy fats in a shelf-stable package
2. **Dried berries** - Antioxidants and quick-release carbs for energy bursts
3. **Chia seeds** - Omega-3s, fiber, and protein that expand in your stomach
4. **Jerky/cured meats** - Long-lasting protein that requires no refrigeration
5. **Dark chocolate** - Mood-boosting, energy-providing trail magic

## The Psychology of Trail Nutrition

Through my hypnotherapy practice, I've observed that hikers who maintain steady blood sugar levels experience significantly better mental resilience. The right nutrition doesn't just fuel your body‚Äîit stabilizes your mood, enhances focus, and prevents the negative thought spirals that can derail your adventure.

When planning your trail menu, consider not just the physical fuel but the mental boost certain foods provide. That favorite trail snack might be worth its weight for the psychological lift it delivers during challenging moments.

## Wildlife-Safe Food Storage

Remember to protect both your supplies and local wildlife:
* Use bear canisters or properly hung bear bags
* Store food in odor-proof containers
* Clean cooking areas thoroughly
* Never eat in your tent
* Check local regulations before your trip

**Self Defense:**

**-** though 3 damage is not a lot later game, it's still 5-10% extra damage on some late game items. I've considered taking it as a min/max on the permanent boons.

Kendu is a completely organic memecoin that is just over a year old, we are on Ethereum, Solana and BASE. We are entirely focused on community and have nearly 18k holders. Whilst I am positive you have seen Kendu either on Twitter, Reddit, Stocktwits, Coin Market Cap, Instagram or wherever else, I will still give a quick overview.  
Kendu has reached 50k votes to earn a free Certik audit, the only other coin to ever do this was Pepe... I mean that should tell you a lot. Certik is a very reputable, crypto security platform, Kendu got an A rating which is insanely good.  
Kendu has an incredible amount of IRL products and events which I am covering below!!!

See the bottom paragraph to read about the¬†**Kendu Standard**

**The Kendu Brand**

Kendu has many IRL products: Kendu Energy, Kendu Coffee, Kendu Merch, Kendu animation, Kendu games, Kendu Gum, Kendu Creator, Kendu pendants, Kendu Beer, Kendu Video Games and Kendu Games.  
It is crazy that we have all these products at a market cap of 12 million, Kendu is doing all of this whilst most of its holders are down.... Imagine what will happen when Kendu's holders are millionaires, with a lot of money to create!!!

Kendu Creator is a website that allows people to 3d print a Kendu mask to make videos on social media. These videos can be non crypto related like taekwondo or running or weightlifting, with these videos flooding social media, Kendu is gonna extend its reach even further!!!  
If one of these videos go viral, Kendu will see massive gains

Kendu was at Miami Art Basel, NoSleep305 was present and even created a Kendu Mural in a very busy part of Miami  
Kendu Entertainment(ran by Ishan) is hosting Pickleball events in India, which is a very popular sport in India. This is gathering lots of traction in the Pickleball community and has been a great success so far. Kendu was very recently at Miami Music Week, where we have given a few thousand energy drinks out, Kendu cocktails(cocktails made with Kendu Energy) and merch.

**Florida Grove**

**Some Thoughts About Previous Successful Coins**

Shib had a ATH of 44 billion in the bull run in 2021, Pepe had an ATH of 10 billion in a bear market..... In both situations there was far less money in crypto, yet these coins reached face melting ATHs.  
Shib, Doge and Pepe all proved that all you need is a solid community, KOLs don't matter and that the only thing you need is an army of obsessed workers. This is what Kendu has.  
With more money in crypto, far more understanding and belief in memecoins and a proven path, Kendu can top the highs of the previous memecoin hall of famers, Kendu belongs up there with them.  
Kendu is everywhere on social media and we are matching what Pepe, Shib and Doge managed on their run to the top.  
IRL we clear every memecoin ever, all the signs are there

At Kendu, the mission is simple.... we build, build, build until we reach the stars.

**The Kendu Standard**

What is the Kendu Standard?

It is the standard to which Kendu is setting, the standard to which all memecoins will aim to meet after Kendu runs to the billions. Kendu is revolutionising the game with its IRL products and events, the sheer amount of quality and quantity of Kendu's IRL alpha has never been seen or done before..... no coin comes close.  
Kendu is changing the game and we will be the dream for many future coins 

Shib, Pepe, Doge or whatever coin that has existed before, has came nowhere near to Kendu's IRL expeditions and soon with enough holders, Kendu will top every coin in social media metrics. This is the Shib opportunity of 2025, but we are not copying Shib, we are transforming the memecoin game.

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, get to know on a personal level, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older(30+). Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I‚Äôd be okay with it if there was some flirting involved, but I‚Äôm not looking for anything very sexual. If your post history is mostly or completely nsfw, we likely won‚Äôt jive. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I have a dog that I love very much 
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/OxamSqG)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started!

Got the first half planned with Miami, and homestead (day trip to Everglades, day trip to key largo/islamorada) but the last half December 28th till the 1st keep reading and changing on what to do. Our family is very activity oriented (although teen daughters seem to just care about tanning) and parents can do a little bit of exploring but would be just as content to have some coffee/beers and watch some boats go by (they have a cottage by a marina up in Georgian bay). Keep flipping-flopping about staying in marathon and do a day trip to key west or staying in key west directly. 

Plan on only being there 3 nights and 4 days (plan on leaving the 31st and just checking into airport hotel for new years).

Thought about renting a house but more inclined to have a hotel/resort vibe. Feel like there would be more things to do (bonus points if places have pickle ball or beach volleyball court)

If staying marathon was looking at tranquility bay or hawks cay. Could do some relaxing and still do a day trip to key west to check out old town and one of the forts (March break went to St. Augustine and loved it)

Other option is staying in key west directly. Feel like it would be better for us and kids to get up and explore by foot with lots of things to see and do, but may be a bit too hectic for the folks?

Tl:Dr a ketogenic diet with low fodmap elements for 3 months, then repopulation of microbiome and a healthy whole foods diet with lots of veg to feed good bacteria. Intermittent fasting throughout, 8 hour window of eating leaving 4 hour gaps between meals. You need to research your diet sometimes you need more soluble fiber, sometimes less or more insoluble and on occasion it's just growing pains. SSRI to help with anxiety issues stemming from Sibo for a period, no longer on them, I can eat what I want but mostly eat healthy. Listen to suggested podcast at bottom 

First of all, this is not the 3 musketeers. One (solution) for all!! No, everyone has unique issues which may be causing Sibo. But diet and poor lifestyle is responsible for a significant number of our problems, we think we eat healthy but we just don't. My father and sister slowly became severely gluten intolerant, I suspect the western diet gave them Sibo but they were asymptomatic, unfortunately it destroyed their stomach lining and gluten messes them up for a few days. My father has been eating the same diet as me, promoting a healthy gut microbiome (minus gluten from some products I eat and sourdough bread). Now if he accidentally eats gluten his symptoms are significantly less severe. He can once again tolerate dairy and he was becoming allergic to it with his lip swelling up after eating cheese for a period, you can become allergic to something at any age apparently, you can guess what I blame. 

*Most of what I am saying especially on diet is backed by scientific research on the microbiome, I've studied psychology so I can read scientific research papers efficiently. I'm not getting technical in explaining shit, do your own research if don't believe me, the microbiome has been popularised recently which would have been helpful to me 6 years ago üòÇ so you can do this easily. I'll recommend a podcast to begin with at the end and a link to his book which you should buy. A significant amount of you can skip to diet stage but it's case dependant and I won't be helping you assess this, follow my pathway if your more comfortable. 
 
Personal profile and medication:
~Asthmatic 
~Hiatus hernia, pantoprazole (PPI=proton pump inhibitor stops body producing excessive acid) is used to treat heart burn which can stem from hernia. This medication has a correlation with Sibo sufferers and is often believed by many to be culprit of Sibo. I disagree, people eat shit food which leads to dysbiosis/Sibo, sugary foods and bacteria cause excessive production of acid people go to doctor as a result and get PPI or they have hiatus hernia, already on PPI eat shit food and get Sibo.
~ADHD diagnosis before it was trendy (I like to joke üôÉ) Tyvanse (vyvanse, it's a stimulant) 
~allergic to nuts = death
~allergic to fish 
~formally allergic to eggs, cats and dogs (exposure therapy, I didn't eat the dogs and only some pussy üò≥ look more jokes) 
~Sleep issues, mirtazapine an anti anxiety used instead of sleeping medicine as less addictive
~periods of anxiety/depression (ssri formerly) meditation currently, don't knock it till you try it mindfulness has been proven to be as effective as medications and prevents relapses in lots of individuals

Sibo symptoms: I had gas, vomiting, nausea in vehicles, constipation, diarrhoea, stomach was sore to touch, bloating, cramps and burning sensations like my intestines were on fire. I was anxious isolated and depressed. 

Treatments undertook:
~antibiotics
~herbal, mmc and enzymes 
~Elemental diet for 3 weeks, I done this twice 
~Keto with low fodmap elements 3 months and intermittent fasting
~probiotic foods
~Diet of whole foods that promotes gut health
~ssri, sertraline (anxiety)

I'm only going to state what I believe worked to save time with exception to the elemental diet. I done the elemental diet for 3 weeks, initially I felt significantly better but this was short lived. I done it again about 6 months later to no effect this time. Concensus was when I was ill bacteria can hibernate for extended periods of time. This was why it was recommended herbal treatments last 6 weeks and you need multiple rounds of antibiotics. I highly advise against using the elemental diet if possible, it makes 0 sense to me how bacteria can hibernate for herbal/anti-biotic but suddenly when you do an elemental diet they go on hunger strike instead of low power mode. I'm not saying it can't work, but I'm dubious about it's efficiency. 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Side note: I'm not against herabls, when doing Keto but I don't believe I did. 

What worked: Prayer üôè Nah, I'm just fucking with you ü§£
I done the keto diet with only 20 grams of carbs per day, but realised I needed to incorporate low fodmap into it also to avoid symptoms from things like cauliflower rice. Before going into more detail I'm going to explain why Keto benefitted by explaining how I believe I got SIBO. 

I used to drink and take a lot of drugs in college, I stopped a year before my issues but drugs are not good for the microbiome, shocking üò± I noticed my issues when I started vaping, I used to smoke and at the time this was believed to be healthy way of quitting, this initially caused stomach cramps, maybe slowed acid production/mmc but I dunno just suspicious. My diet was poor, the standard dog shit western diet and I have always struggled with sleep, when I eat I get tired so I used to eat a large snack then fall asleep when my body was on low power mode, bacteria likely travelled to small intestine at night with poor mmc. 

The path to sibo is complex but the makeup of SIBO is assumed to be twofold, 1. Bacteria is in your small intestine in large quantities. 2. You have a white nationalist microbiome ü§® it's not diverse and struggles to break down complex foods, fodmaps. I say assumed because if number 1 is not true (or no longer true) number 2 will still present you with symptoms of sibo, this is known as Dysbiosis, Sibo is a subcategory of dysbiosis.

The bacteria in your gut are largely specialists in breaking down specific foods, if you eat to much sugary or processed foods these will be your dominant strains, they're largely unhelpful bacteria to your health. You will lack the largely beneficial bacteria associated with a stronger immune system that are found/fed with whole natural foods. When I switched to Keto+low fodmap, the bacteria was starved of its food source, significant numbers died over an extended period of time. 

*Be warned staying on any diet will result in some bacteria capable in switching food sources doing so, good and bad. Jordan Peterson's dumb fuck daughter had stomach/health issues, she started eating less foods beneficial for her gut unsurprisingly she could tolerate less and less foods, now she promotes being a small brained T-Rex carnivore which makes her richer and her + her fans sicker. 

Side note relevant still: Intermittent fasting, your body needs time to digest foods, give it time. Don't cause a backlog, 4 hours between meals minimum, I do 8 hour window of eating which is 3 meals, water or herbal tea when fasting. 

The keto diet was recommended to me by a redditor, he advised 6 months I done 3. Research how to do Keto if you want to go down this root, it's pretty simple but I don't want to give bad advice due to my bad memory. 

I was largely better but every so often something would trigger me. I started researching microbiome extensively and came to the conclusion my diet was not leading to a diverse microbiome, I no longer had sibo but could not break down fodmaps very well. The plan was now to repopulate. 

To do this I eat NATURAL yoghurt, this is yoghurt with no additives which is rich in bacteria, it's bitter and the ingredients include nothing hence the name, if your unsure look at the packet if it says yoghurt natural live strains/cultures and nothing else, you win ü•≥. (Don't get unpasteurized bollocks. You aren't missing out on anything. This is science backed. Pasteurised milk is just heated milk that kills pathogens and yes beneficial bacteria, risk more negative strains at your peril. Starter beneficial cultures you need are introduced to ferment the milk, they eat away for few days growing in numbers and creating the yoghurt that would occur naturally if it wasn't pasteurised minus RFK Jr. flu) Its bitter but I have grown to love it, some people hate the taste but get over it, don't get processed yoghurt with flavourings, sweeteners, bacteria added, it's just not the same thing, don't tell me otherwise, your just wrong, I will fight you üò°. The other thing I used is Kefir, same again no fucking additives, it's awful but full of bacteria. Kimchi and sauerkraut are also beneficial but I never got around to trying them. 

Next feed the immigrants you've welcomed into your utopian build. This is scary as you throughout repopulation and feeding the newcomers you will get some symptoms like gas, constipation etc. These are growing pains. 
Whole foods only, predominantly wide range of vegetables!!! You can get natural sauces like mayo, salad toppings or you can make them, just check ingredients. Fruits are somewhat beneficial but they're full of sugar. So eat fruits sparingly, the bad boys enjoy the sugar. I eat them now because I have a sweet tooth and they're fine once your healthy again in moderation. But there's no scientific evidence that you need fruits, you can get all the vitamins you need within vegetables, including calcium, protein etc. Don't worry I'm not a vegetarian lecturer now, ethically I would like to be, but I still like meat. You can tailor the process somewhat to avoid some symptoms if going somewhere or it's too much, maybe introduce small amounts of problem foods. But don't stop eating the yogurt for breakfast or whenever. Spices are beneficial and add flavour to meals, you can make so many tasty meals, if you see whole foods and think wow so no flavour you just don't frankly know how to cook. It's why I hate the American meme that says Brits have awful food, no motherfucker, vegetables come with flavours built in, you've just deep fried your taste buds with salt and sugar. I'm Irish, plenty of reason to dislike the Brits, ugh..... Anyway

Sibo is somewhat in your head, your gut is a major contributor to your mental health. It produces feel good chemicals which is why binge eating is an issue with depressed people and those lacking in dopamine like my fellow ADHD brothers and sisters. For instance, a common issue is stomach problems cause anxiety, anxiety causes stomach problems (even in normal people, the phrase he looks like he's shitting himself references the relationship), now you have a vicious cycle. When we have Sibo or dybosis this critical process in production of feel good chemicals is interrupted, symptoms can cause problems anxiety/depression/isolation, but even with people just suffering with mental health diet is of major relevance and can be a cause. If you take bacteria from a person with schizophrenia and place it in a rat the rat will show signs of schizophrenia. Dementia has a strong correlation with diet and gut health. The relationship can't be overlooked. 

Back to me: Symptoms to eating fodmaps had pretty much dissappeared. However I had lingering anxiety from the years of incidents, when I was nervous about things such as when I had to travel my brain tricked me and I felt symptoms believing it to be Sibo, I felt like I was about to get sick or need to go to the toilet. I believe I had started developing agoraphobia, this is a fear of leaving places your comfortable with, the extremities of those with this condition may refuse to leave their home. It can start like this, a person with anxiety has a panic attack on a crowded bus (I was trying to not vomit on the grandmother sitting beside me ü§¢üòÇ), a strong association of going on a bus and symptoms is developed so you avoid public transport. Another time a person has a panic attack occurring in a crowded place like cinema/shop an association of panic attacks around lots of people is formed. Essentially you avoid places/events which make you anxious due to past experiences which can progress to not leaving the house. 

The last step was removal of food and social anxieties from years of solitude. Meditation alone helps some people but I'm not telling you what to do, be open minded to medication, therapy, everything. Simple fix for me really, SSRI, this medication is used for people with anxiety disorders and/or depression but is used with ibs patients, the feel good factors disturb the vicious cycle of stomach problems and anxiety mentioned previously. Baby steps to improving socialising, it's too extensive to cover but Cognitive behavioural therapy which I know from college. You essentially start with something that gives you minor anxiety (imagine holding spider) and work your way up to things that give you major anxiety (holding spider), speak to a therapist if relevant to you or get a reputable self help book. 

Today I am 100% cured, some foods like porridge took a while until I wasn't running for the toilet and coffee. But now I can tolerate everything. I eat healthy 95% of time still, two weeks ago I ate like a pig on holiday, no issue but best not relapse üòÖ

That's all I got for you, hopefully helps some of you ‚ù§Ô∏è

Podcast with Tim Spector on gut microbiome, the podcast host is recently associated with misinformation but Tim is legit, he uses scientific research and you can look up his credentials:

Tim's book which is a good read, it's scientific in it's contents but not complex: Food for life

1jsyjjd,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1jsyjjd,Was gonna try and grab some coffee with this girl I cold approached,"I feel like this is one of those situations where I should just assume that if they wanted to they would and postponing to next weekend is kinda a kicking the can down the road thing.

I was thinking about saying sumn along the lines of:

Hey sorry you're busy all week, good luck with work, but I think it's safe ro assume you're not interested, and that's fine however I would have appreciated it if you had communicated that earlier as I cleared my Sunday evening based on what you told me yesterday. And I don't want to waste any more of my weekend time.",13,1743958169.0,HowDoIRespondToThis,10,0.93,False
1jsyj8c,https://www.reddit.com/r/superautomatic/comments/1jsyj8c/jura_e8_filter_replacement_question/,Jura E8 filter replacement question,"Hello,

3 months ago I bought Jura E8 coffee machine. We generally drink Cappuccino. i am seeing water filter is almost out of  life. I do have reverse osmosis water and I use only reverse osmosis water in the coffee machine. 

Since I have reverse osmosis water, i really dont need any filter in the coffee machine. 

Once Jura E8 filter is out of life, can anyone of you give me tips on how to use the same filter or any alternative way to just use reverse osmosis water or any alterative way",1,1743958145.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

The coffee I am talking about is the Ethiopian Suke Quto from Partners Coffee out of Brooklyn. 

The cherry flavor is really nice on this one and it doesn‚Äôt overpower the coffee flavors, and is still very noticeable. 

I am quickly running out and really only having this coffee on particularly relaxing weekend mornings.

Let‚Äôs face it: Bitcoin is magic internet money. You click a button, and‚Äîpoof!‚Äîyour value flies through cyberspace to land in someone else's wallet. But sometimes‚Ä¶ it gets stuck. Like, really stuck. You‚Äôre sitting there, refreshing your block explorer like a maniac, wondering if your transaction died in the mempool or went to crypto purgatory.

That‚Äôs where **Bitcoin TXID Accelerator** swoops in like a digital superhero with a blazing-fast cape made of code and cryptographic fairy dust.

We built this app for the Bitcoiners who don‚Äôt have time to wait, and don‚Äôt want to throw away precious sats on outrageous fees. It‚Äôs your fast lane on the Bitcoin highway‚Äîwithout the tollbooth guilt.

# ‚õìÔ∏è What Is the Bitcoin TXID Accelerator?

In simple terms, it‚Äôs a transaction accelerator for Bitcoin. But in *fun* terms? It‚Äôs a high-powered, mempool-surfing rocket booster for your stuck BTC transactions.

When you send a Bitcoin transaction with too low a fee‚Äîeither because you‚Äôre feeling thrifty, or you didn‚Äôt anticipate a mempool traffic jam‚Äîit can linger unconfirmed for hours or even days. Bitcoin TXID Accelerator takes that TXID (transaction ID) and does something magical: it gets miners and networks to pay attention to it again.

Kind of like nudging someone in a busy caf√© line and saying, ‚ÄúHey, can you hurry that up?‚Äù

# üö¶How Does It Work?

Great question, sat stacker. Here‚Äôs how it goes down:

1. **You visit** [**https://www.txidaccelerator.com**](https://www.txidaccelerator.com)**.**
2. You enter your stuck **Bitcoin transaction ID** (TXID).
3. You click ‚ÄúAccelerate.‚Äù
4. *Magic happens.*
5. Your transaction gets picked up faster‚Äîsometimes in the *very next block*.

It‚Äôs like giving your transaction a VIP backstage pass to the blockchain. Everyone else is still waiting in line, and your TXID just waltzed past security with sunglasses on.

# üõ†Ô∏è Under the Hood (Nerdy Bits)

Okay, for the techies in the back, here‚Äôs a sneak peek behind the curtain:

The Bitcoin TXID Accelerator taps into a network of global Bitcoin nodes and partners with mining pools that monitor and prioritize transactions. Some of these miners allow fee-bumping methods or simply accept transactions that get relayed again through new mempool routes.

We also leverage a few techniques like:

* **Node Rebroadcasting:** We give your TX a new wave of propagation across the network.
* **Mempool Reinjection:** If your TX is dropped from mempools due to being too old or low-fee, we help reintroduce it into the ecosystem.
* **Partner Pools:** Some pools simply like us. We‚Äôve built a rapport with certain miners who help give your TX a gentle push forward.

No fee-bumping? No Replace-by-Fee (RBF)? No problem. We‚Äôve got tricks for both legacy and modern transactions.

# ü§ë Who Is It For?

Bitcoin TXID Accelerator is perfect for:

* **Merchants** who don‚Äôt want to wait hours for confirmation on a payment.
* **HODLers** who accidentally sent a low-fee TX (again).
* **Developers** testing apps or wallets and don‚Äôt want to be held hostage by the mempool.
* **Anyone** who's impatient (no shame‚Äîwe‚Äôre all living on blockchain time).

# üß† Why We Built It

We‚Äôre Bitcoiners too. We know the pain of sending a transaction that just... sits there. Especially during those spicy times when the mempool is more clogged than the comment section on a crypto tweet.

We wanted to build something that was:

* **Simple.** No confusing wallet integrations or downloads.
* **Fast.** Enter TXID, press button, move on.
* **Free to try.** Some accelerations are on the house. Premium boosts are available for the serious sat slingers.
* **Non-custodial.** We never touch your coins. We‚Äôre not a wallet. We're not an exchange. We're just your TX's personal trainer.

# üì± Mobile-Friendly & Always On

Our site works just as smoothly on your phone as it does on your laptop. Whether you're in line for coffee or climbing a volcano with a satellite phone, you can speed up that TX with a few taps.

(Okay maybe not the volcano part, unless it's El Salvador and you‚Äôve got volcanic internet. Respect.)

# üòé Bonus Features Coming Soon

We‚Äôre always leveling up. Keep an eye on these upcoming upgrades:

* **Telegram Bot:** Accelerate your TX right from your group chat. Flex on your friends in real time.
* **API Access:** Automate transaction acceleration for your wallet or app.
* **Status Tracker:** See where your TX is, what it‚Äôs doing, and whether it had lunch yet.
* **Mempool Heatmap:** Visualize congestion in real-time like a crypto traffic cop.

# üß° The Community Vibe

Bitcoin isn‚Äôt just a network‚Äîit‚Äôs a movement. And part of that ethos is about *taking control* of your own money. Bitcoin TXID Accelerator fits right into that philosophy. No gatekeepers, no middlemen, no need to beg a mining pool in broken Mandarin.

Just click, boost, and move on.

And if you love what we‚Äôre doing, help spread the word! Tweet about us. Meme about us. Yell ‚ÄúACCELERATE ME!‚Äù from the top of your favorite citadel. Your transaction deserves to move at the speed of freedom.

# üéâ Final Thoughts

At the end of the day, Bitcoin is about empowerment. It‚Äôs about shaking off the old system, breaking free from banks, and stepping into a world where **you are your own bank**.

But let‚Äôs be real‚Ä¶ even banks process transactions faster sometimes.

So when your BTC is moving like a sloth on sedatives, remember:  
üëâ [**https://www.txidaccelerator.com**](https://www.txidaccelerator.com)

Get your Bitcoin moving again‚Äîbecause time is money, and your sats deserve the express lane. üöÄ

1jsyfxh,https://www.reddit.com/r/BenignExistence/comments/1jsyfxh/had_a_really_nice_lunch_the_other_day/,Had a really nice lunch the other day.,"Husband & I decided to go out for lunch and stopped into a local coffee shop that also has little bagel-and-egg type sandwiches.  I grabbed a table while he went up to order our food.

While waiting, I just kind of absorbed what was going on around me and it was all so pleasant!

Right next to me on one side was a young person of indeterminate gender reading an old sci fi book that I recognized as being one of MY favorites when I was younger.  If I were less shy (or if they looked less engrossed) I might have said something but instead I just enjoyed seeing them enjoy their book. (Isaac Asimov, 'The Caves of Steel')

On the other side of me was a young couple who seemed to be on a date, not a first date but seemed to be early in the relationship.  They were playing some card game I'm not familiar with, and she was teaching him the rules as they went.  They were both SO kind and respectful to each other. It gave me warm fuzzies.

And then across from me was an older gentleman with his granddaughter who was an older baby (IDK how old but not quite a toddler).  I knew it was his granddaughter because he was proudly showing her off to a couple about my age (50ish) that were at the table next to him and talking about how they were having ""grandpa day"".  He was SO PROUD of that little girl, and she was giggling and grabbing at everything while the other couple cooed at her.  Cutest part was the pink diaper bag he had slung over the back of his chair.  I love it when men aren't afraid to demonstrate love and sensitivity.

Then I got distracted by my beloved husband arriving with our food and we had a lovely little lunch together. <3",94,1743957906.0,BenignExistence,4,1.0,False

Just a reminder to feel your feelings and to not let anyone put a clock on your grief.

The kids and I have been staying at my dad‚Äôs place‚Äî still haven‚Äôt gone ‚Äúhome.‚Äù Whatever that means.  Home was a place and a time where my wife was alive.

I‚Äôm about to apply for a new apartment so that we have some space for ourselves‚Äî but it just feels like another nail in the coffin.

Every little thing that gets done feels like I‚Äôm erasing a part of her.

Closing her accounts, getting through the memorial and funeral, moving the phone plan‚Äîholding my wife‚Äôs urn.

These things have to be done, but it doesn‚Äôt make it any easier.

I still cry a bit every day, but in a healthy way.  I don‚Äôt like being that way in front of the kids though.  People say it‚Äôs good that they learn from me that it‚Äôs okay to cry, but all I can think about is the long-term implications of my actions and how they perceive them.

I‚Äôm thinking about joining a dating app to meet someone to keep me company.  I‚Äôm not interested in a rushed, sexual relationship‚Äî I just want someone who would be willing to do things like walk in the park together or go get coffee, because I know I‚Äôm not ready for a real partner yet.  

I still feel married in a lot of ways, but I also feel very alone.  I‚Äôm grateful to the friends and family that have been good to me‚Äî and no one will ever take my wife‚Äôs place in my heart‚Äî but I also know that my heart can grow, the same way it did when I had my second child.

I kept forgetting that time marches on, that we age at different paces, and that our lives revolve around the same sun, and cell division slows(this never bothered me but still try to make healthy choices). Sharing the same moon is gravity of the soul.

You appear in my thoughts, especially as I try to sleep, and I've challenged the lesson & limerence theory with much research only to return to faith and a possible cosmic string. Prayer never hurts.

My intuition, that gut feeling, has been right almost every time, statistically speaking. But maybe this is that rare exception, the 1.8% where my faith falters. Though, even this feeling, if it pushes me to be better, kinder, stronger, isn't truly a failure. It's a kind of safety net, or a grapple & rope to climb out of a deep unmarked well.

It's been years, and honestly, sappily speaking you where the last lingering embrace. Not that I'm waiting for anything specific, though maybe a small part of me fates. I live day to day, and as I get older, intimacy has become a conscious choice, not a fleeting moment. I've turned away from casual encounters, whether it's faith or sobriety that guides me. I still hold onto the hope for a deep, meaningful connection...or maybe I'm just a hopeless dreamer, destined to die with regrets rejecting consensual instant gratification of the past 6 or 7 years. Coffee tastes better with conversation between hearts in the a:m.

You're never far from my heart felt thoughts, and I celebrate your successes from the space in between. When you're hurting, know that I care, and that I love you in a way I still struggle to understand.

Perfection, even in a lifetime is an illusion, but the beauty of a soul, like yours, is a rare and precious thing, only seen by the gaze of few eyes.

Welcome!  We have coffee! Can probably dig up a diet coke for you here somewhere if you're more comfortable with that

I'm going to help you out:

We don't like conference. That's how we feel about it. Sometimes we will make fun of the messages.  Sorry not sorry if that offends you, you came here to see it. 

Some of us do watch it, for various reasons.  Most of us have family in your position and it helps to know what was said

Some of us don't watch it. 

Things we also don't like: you telling us we are losers for ""obsessing about a church we pretend we left"". This is an exmo subreddit.  This is the place to talk about it. 

Contrary to what you may think or have been told, we don't bitch about the church all day every day, but oddly enough, we DO talk about the church in this subreddit! Especially on conference weekend!  Weird, right?

* Hammock Stand with hammock & pillow
* ThermoMaven wireless meat thermometer
* Leather desk pad
* vevor outdoor tool organizer

* full motion wall mount tv swing arm(s)
* eufy outdoor mounts (so much better than OEM)
* vehicle multi-charger plugins
* cellphone cases/screen protectors
* large kitchen timers

* power tool wall hanger/organizer
* attic door insulation cover
* eufy solar charging panels
* power tool accessories, like multi-tool blades, drill bits etc
* garden hoses
* brand-name kitchen utensils
* ceiling fans...just be super picky and read reviews first



Stuff I plan to use soon, and happy to get a discount on it:

1. eufy outdoor lights
2. office chairs (been through several, some have absolutely stunk, some are OK, I change chairs more than buy new jeans)

  
Stuff that generally is a waste of time and space and money

* clothes, they never fit me right
* shoes..they don't generally last long
* kids toys...they don't last long, just expect it, but for the cheap they can still be a good deal (like light saber knock offs)

Best piece of advice for noobs...**do not panic, do not rush to select right away**. If you see one of something you think you'd LOVE....chances are there'll be 5-10 more versions of it popping up soon. Once you got more than a year under a your belt, you can easily decide what will fit you.

\*\*Government-Supported Community Spaces: Revitalizing Public Life & Reducing Digital Consumption\*\*  
\*A Practical Framework for Social Reconnection\*

---

### \*\*The Challenge: Isolation in a Digitally Dominated World\*\*  
While social media platforms offer a veneer of connectivity, they often prioritize engagement metrics over genuine human interaction. This results in digital spaces cluttered with algorithm-driven content, bots, and commercial agendas. Meanwhile, public spaces‚Äîparks and recreation centers supported by taxpayer dollars‚Äîare underused. This initiative proposes a government-coordinated, weekly gathering that transforms these spaces into warm, unbranded hubs for organic, low-pressure connection. The goal is to reintroduce the simple pleasure of face-to-face interaction in a setting that feels safe, human, and free of overt market influences.

---

### \*\*Core Proposal\*\*

\*\*1. Weekly Community Hours in Public Spaces\*\*  
   - \*\*Structure\*\*:  
     - \*\*Fixed Time/Location\*\*: Every Saturday from 10 AM‚Äì2 PM at centrally located parks or recreation centers, with indoor backup plans for inclement weather.  
     - \*\*No-Cost Amenities & Food\*\*:  
       - Complimentary light refreshments such as coffee, sandwiches, and community potluck-style offerings.  
       - Food is provided in a way that emphasizes community sharing rather than commercial branding, creating a space that feels removed from market pressures.
     - \*\*Activity Zones & Games\*\*:  
       - \*\*Interactive Games\*\*: Gentle physical activities like tug-of-war, board games, or other simple challenges that are fun yet not overly competitive.  
       - \*\*Fun prizes & Rewards\*\*: Winners of these games or challenges receive modest, community-sourced prizes (e.g., tokens, handmade items, or local crafts) to incentivize participation without creating a commercial atmosphere.
     - \*\*Subtle Support\*\*:  
       - Social workers or community volunteers are available at an informal ‚ÄúHelp & Conversation‚Äù booth, offering guidance only upon request.  
   - \*\*Activities\*\*:  
     - Optional, themed sessions such as ‚ÄúSkill Swap Hour‚Äù or ‚ÄúLocal History Talks‚Äù encourage dialogue and skill sharing without making participation feel obligatory.

\*\*2. Funding & Partnerships\*\*  
   - \*\*Taxpayer Efficiency\*\*:  
     - Redirect 2‚Äì5% of existing budgets from mental health and park maintenance to fund these events, ensuring a responsible use of public funds.  
     - For example, a city with a $2M parks budget could allocate between $60,000 and $100,000 annually to support staffing, supplies, games, and modest prizes.
   - \*\*Community & Nonprofit Collaborations\*\*:  
     - Engage local nonprofits, community groups, and volunteers to contribute supplies and coordinate activities‚Äîkeeping the initiative grassroots and free from overt corporate influence.
     - Partnerships with local artisans or community kitchens can supply food or prizes in a way that underscores communal support rather than market branding.

\*\*3. Safety & Accessibility\*\*  
   - \*\*Discreet, Friendly Security\*\*:  
     - Off-duty police or trained community staff will be present in a non-intrusive manner to ensure everyone‚Äôs safety while preserving a welcoming atmosphere.
   - \*\*Universal Access\*\*:  
     - Venues will be fully ADA-compliant, with clear multilingual signage and dedicated quiet or sensory-friendly zones to cater to all community members.  
     - No registration or ID checks are required, ensuring an open, unguarded environment where everyone feels welcome.

---

### \*\*Addressing Key Concerns\*\*

#### \*\*1. Avoiding Stigma: ‚ÄúFor Everyone, By Everyone‚Äù\*\*  
   - \*\*Neutral Framing\*\*:  
     - Events are marketed simply as ‚ÄúCommunity Hours‚Äù or ‚ÄúNeighbor Days,‚Äù emphasizing collective belonging without labels or therapeutic implications.  
     - Example tagline: \*‚ÄúYour park. Your people. Every Saturday.‚Äù\*  
   - \*\*Voluntary, Enjoyable Participation\*\*:  
     - Attendees are free to join group activities, engage in a friendly game of tug-of-war, or simply enjoy a quiet moment‚Äîensuring that no one feels pressured into interaction.

#### \*\*2. Practical Benefits for Taxpayers\*\*  
   - \*\*Preventive Value\*\*:  
     - Utilizing existing public spaces and resources helps prevent more costly social and health issues by fostering community support networks.  
   - \*\*Community ROI\*\*:  
     - Enhanced face-to-face interactions can lead to new job leads, shared skills, and local volunteer initiatives, ultimately boosting overall community productivity.

#### \*\*3. Realistic Social Dynamics\*\*  
   - \*\*Organic Interaction\*\*:  
     - Whether through casual games, shared meals, or unstructured time in communal seating areas, the design encourages natural, spontaneous connections.  
   - \*\*Overcoming the ‚ÄúStranger Barrier‚Äù\*\*:  
     - The visible presence of others who are seeking similar experiences removes the hesitation often experienced during isolated park visits, building a shared sense of purpose.

#### \*\*4. Digital Detox Incentive\*\*  
   - \*\*A Human-Centric Alternative\*\*:  
     - These Community Hours provide a safe space where real identities, local shared experiences, and tangible interactions replace the superficiality of digital platforms‚Äîhelping reduce overall screen time.

---

### \*\*Expected Outcomes\*\*

#### \*\*Short-Term (6‚Äì12 Months)\*\*  
- \*\*Enhanced Park Utilization\*\*: A projected 30‚Äì40% increase in weekend foot traffic at pilot locations.  
- \*\*Stronger Local Networks\*\*: Surveys may show around 25% of participants exchanging contact information for future meetups or casual play dates.  
- \*\*Reduced Digital Reliance\*\*: Participants might report reducing their daily social media use by 1‚Äì2 hours on average.

#### \*\*Long-Term (3‚Äì5 Years)\*\*  
- \*\*Economic Efficiency\*\*: For every $1 invested, the program is expected to save $3‚Äì4 in reduced healthcare, policing, and social service costs.  
- \*\*Cultural Transformation\*\*: Parks and public spaces evolve into symbols of community vitality and genuine connection rather than areas associated with isolation.  
- \*\*Scalability\*\*: The adaptable model can be tailored‚Äîsuch as ‚ÄúFriday Night BBQs‚Äù in rural areas or ‚ÄúUrban Lounge Hours‚Äù in cities‚Äîand replicated across communities nationwide.

---

### \*\*Conclusion: Reclaiming Public Life\*\*  
This initiative is a grounded, realistic response to the challenges of digital isolation and underused public spaces. By leveraging existing community assets and emphasizing organic interaction, Community Hours offer a safe, unbranded environment where genuine human connections can flourish. It‚Äôs not a grand experiment but a return to the fundamentals of social life‚Äîwhere fun games, shared meals, and small rewards create a welcoming space for all.

\*\*Why This Works\*\*:  
- \*\*Low-Cost, High-Impact\*\*: Makes optimal use of existing resources with only modest budgetary adjustments.  
- \*\*Apolitical and Inclusive\*\*: Focuses on universal human needs‚Äîbelonging, safety, and the joy of connection‚Äîwithout commercial influence.  
- \*\*Human-Centric and Realistic\*\*: Emphasizes dignity, choice, and natural social interactions over forced or overly marketed approaches.

I yelled at them about how their behavior was so insulting and hurtful. I yelled, ""While I wiped the shit off your dogs ass, financially supported you, and suffered a sexless relationship, this is what you were doing?!! But good news, it turns out you are capable of feeling sexy?""

They are claiming that this was abusive and insulting. They have yelled at me a ton both before and after this, but this was the second time I ever raised my voice with them.     
I raised my voice one time last year when they were yelling at me, and I said, ""This relationship isn't just about you, I'm allowed to have feelings.""    

  

In the wake of finding out they cheated, I did something I deeply regret. I spiraled and texted one of their friends what happened. I was afraid my partner would make up some horrible story about me and I couldn't stomach the thought. I needed to make sure the truth was out there. Immediately after I hit send, I realized I fucked up, and that I had spiraled really far.   



Two nights ago, I caught them still cheating by sending him nudes while I was asleep.

Yesterday, my partner found out I sent that message to their friend, and they claimed this was abuse too, and that I was out of control and unstable.

They screamed a bunch of insults and said the fact that they cheated doesn't matter. The fact that they yell and scream too doesn't matter. They told me to get out of the house, so I started to leave.

They followed me through the house screaming at me and insulting me, then I turned around to say something. They started shouting over me, so I took one step and waved my finger like, \*I was trying to speak,\* and they reacted like I assaulted them. They jumped back and screamed ""NO"" at me over and over. 

When I got outside and realized I didn't have my debit card, I tried to call them, but they blocked my number. I knocked as gently as I could - because they were actively accusing me of abuse - and they yelled that I was pounding on the door so hard the whole house was rattling.

I asked to talk to them, and they said ""You don't want to talk! You're making me feel unsafe, so I know you're not trying to talk!""   

So I walked to the far end of the driveway. I said, ""I literally just want to talk, I will create every bit of physical space possible, I am as far away as I can be, I just don't understand what's happening and I'm scared and confused. I am stunned that you are treating me this way, and I want to understand and be understood.""

They accused me of a bunch of stuff. For instance, they accused me of lying about going to therapy, so I told them I could show them the emails on my phone setting up each appointment. ""I can set my phone on the ground with the email open, then walk away, and you can come read it. I will stay over here."" 

They said, ""It's too late, I don't believe you.""

They screamed a lot about how unstable I was -  this is because I cried for a few days after I found out they cheated.

I genuinely don't know anymore.

All my therapists have told me I repress all my emotions and do too much care-taking of people who hurt me. They say, under certain circumstances, like when something big happens, it's normal to yell. One even said the words, ""Okay, but why haven't you lost your shit?""  
""I don't think that it's necessary for creating a healthy relationship.""  
""I can agree with that most of the time, but never yelling isn't inherently healthier than yelling once in a while. Has there ever been a time you lost your shit?""  
""One time, when my ex stole my car, drove it drunk, threw up on me, and tried to have sex with me. The next day, I lost control and yelled at her for it.""  
""GOOD. That's a VERY NORMAL REACTION!""  
""I still feel, in my body, like it wasn't okay""  
""Yelling itself is not inherently abuse. It's not what we want in a relationship, but there are times where it's the appropriate reaction, and refusing to experience that is denying truth about ourselves.""

That was the reason I let myself yell. I've had three therapists tell me to finally do it. Now I feel like it was absolutely not okay. Like I was being a huge abusive piece of shit. Their reaction was so extreme. I don't know.

Honestly, I feel so shitty about contacting their friend, I did the moment I hit send. I will feel bad about it for a long time. I was only thinking about my fear of being distorted, and didn't think about the uncomfortable position I put her in. It was wrong of me, but my friends are all saying, ""Yeah, that wasn't cool, but that's not abuse. Cheating is still 10 times worse than telling their friend that they cheated.""

So, I'm gonna ask strangers who aren't invested. My friends could be biased.

I am studying audio engineering at university and a band finally took a chance on me and I mixed their whole show by myself, networked with the in-house engineer there and it went swimmingly.

I worry that I have let this get to my head. It was my friend L's birthday party (20F) and by the time I arrived after mixing the gig the majority of my friends had left. My guy best friend (19M) who i'll call A was there with one of my other closest friend's B (20F). We were there for a few hours and as I mentioned leaving A said he wanted to admit something to me.

I told him not to say it multiple times as I had a feeling about what he was going to say, and he has asked me out before. Even after saying this multiple times to not confess anything and to stay at the party with B, he followed me out the party and walked me home (only 2 mins away as I live basically opposite to where the party was). He asked me out on my doorstep and i wrote it off immediately, he begged to explain himself and I let him explain. Which was basically how he's had a huge crush on me ever since we first met and that when he found out I was going on hinge dates that he was upset about it. 

I asked him if he thought I had led him on and he said I hadn't. I started tpo cry as I didn't want to make him upset by saying no for a second time and told him AGAIN to head back to the party and help B. I then just slammed the door in his face. I started to cry as he started talking and trying to explain and it made me feel terrible having to listen and deny his feelings for me.

I think I could have dealt with it better but i feel like an asshole for not hearing him out for longer when my answer would have been 'no' no matter his justification... it was harsh and it has ruined one of my favourite days, which is super selfish of me to say.

Should i have heard him out? and was I horrible?

I really don't want to see or talk to him again, it has made me re-evaluate everything of what I thought we our friendship. He sent me a message the next day apologising and I told him I needed a break from seeing him for a while.

Friend B told me that A is very sorry about what happened and knows he's in the wrong but that I should forgive him. 

A asked me to coffee as an apology but as I was busy I couldn't make it, he wants to reschedule but I don't know if I feel comfortable rebuilding the friendship.

I just feel like I need to be justified in my reaction I guess? I think cutting him off completely might be too extreme idk",0,1743957361.0,Vent,1,0.5,False

At all. All I do is care for my mom, go to work where I care for ~50 animals, come home and clean up after my dad and my parents dogs, and the half day I get to myself is caring for my boyfriend. Mom's had 6 strokes, 2 open heart surgeries, knee replacement, and weighs 300lbs. She's bed or chair bound and has the short term memory of a toddler.

I wake up, get the dogs out and my mom up and diaper changed. Then I get her coffee, pills, breakfast, and make her brush her hair and teeth. Then I change her bedding that needs changing, then feed the critters. Then I get ready and make her a bag lunch so I can go to work. Then I go and feed and clean up after ~50 animals, getting climbed on, peed on, bit, and reek by the time I get home. I'm usually at work around 4-5 hours 6 days a week outside no matter the weather, then I dog walk for extra money, then I run errands on my way home. I get home and change moms diaper again, she usually needs to lay down for a nap. I take the dogs out and toss the ball or frisbee, or brush them. My mom would literally die if we rehomed the dogs. My dad eventually comes home and I help make dinner or just make dinner if he's not home early enough. Then I feed the dogs and tidy up. After 7pm I'm allowed to do laundry/ dishes- otherwise the electricity rate is like quadrupled. I'm constantly doing laundry and dishes- because my mom doesn't know when she needs to go to the bathroom and the diapers for people her size aren't leak-proof. I have Chucks down but they need to be washed too. Then after dinner I clean up, get mom her PM pills, changed, teeth brushed, and back into bed. Then I'm usually doing laundry/dishes/other cleaning until after midnight-2am. Plus I try to shower my mom at least 3x a week, which I usually have to be in the shower with her because my dad's always got something else to do.

My dad works, so he leaves the house before 5am and if he comes straight home from work he's home around 4pm, but he usually goes to our neighbors or a friend's house to do electricial side-jobs, but i know it's because he doesn't want to be home. He works at a retail store on weekends too, and goes to bed before 9pm every night. Occasionally he sleeps over at my grandparents old house by his work especially in winter before a big storm. And Wednesday nights he bowls on a league. He grew up with his mom/ sisters cleaning up after him, and then when he got with my mom she cleaned up after him, and he thinks I should clean up after him too.
He's a hoarder, the house is filled with his random junk, as is the yard, and all the cars but the one I drive. We have 2 vehicles that haven't ran in at least half a decade that he won't sell or scrap. Our fridge hasn't worked for 3.5 years so he just swaps jugs of ice from the deep freeze downstairs- he thinks I should do it but I refuse. I told him I'd just buy a new fridge with his credit card because that's what a sane person would do. He won't put his own clothes away so he just piles them in their bedroom. He thinks I should be washing/drying/ironing/folding/putting away his clothes. I've been putting my own clothes away since I was 8 years old. He won't let anyone over because the house is such a wreck with his junk and refusal to clean up after himself. He won't let me hire a deep clean service because he thinks I should be doing it. 

The half day I get with my boyfriend of 5 years is the only break I get, and he's got untreated ADHD and depression really badly. He doesn't do laundry or wash dishes anymore because his job is so stressful, all he does it come home from work and sleep. So I usually end up folding his clothes and loading/unloading the dishwasher. He didn't used to be this way, but life keeps piling more stress on him. He's also moving 2200 miles away by next winter, plus he lives an hour away so I'm driving ~2hours every time I want to see him. He's a PoC and my area isn't safe for him so he can't come see me. He's my soulmate and just as he finally decides to commit he finds out he has to move. I haven't been the same since he told me. I've given up. 

I usually get between 2 and 6 hours of sleep. I usually eat my first meal at dinner. I have an energy drink or a hot chocolate for breakfast. I usually have a pop for lunch at work. I don't have the time or money to get more. I don't paint, draw, read, play video games, or do anything else I enjoy and haven't for a few years. I occasionally will play my switch at my boyfriends while he plays GTA online. But we play until he gets tired, we go to bed, and then I stare at the wall until 4am when I finally pass out. When I'm home if I do have time to sit and ""relax"" I'm usually just sitting and staring at my phone while I scroll- I don't retain anything I see on it. I'm constantly exhausted, I've gained a ton of weight from the different insomnia meds they've got me trying, I'm so stressed that I am constantly shaking or my organs feel like they're shaking inside of me. I have time to shower maybe twice a week, i haven't been doing my skincare or haircare- and I had hair down below my butt, I had my coworker chop it to be easier to manage, but it's not really growing at all anymore, same with my fingernails. I'm constantly cold, bruised, scratched, and aching. Everything hurts all the time. My doctors say it's anxiety and my weight. I cant cry anymore- I try and nothing comes out. When I do cry it's over something stupid like my dad ate the last of something I was looking forward to and it's huge sobs that take over my body and make me hurt worse. And I have to do it in secret otherwise my mom tells me she wishes she was dead so I wouldn't have to take care of her, and my dad laughs at me and tells me it's not a big deal. My boyfriend just beats himself up and makes his depression worse. All my friends have moved on with life and don't know how to help because none of them have been through caring for a parent. My brother got out when he was in high school and has refused to come back to help at all, the most i get from him is a text that says ""*hugs*"". And one time he sent me a book I havent had time to read. 

I'm in complete shutdown but if I leave my dad will have to put my mom in a cheap AF home where she'll be abused and die from starving herself to death- she was doing it in the last one she was in after the most recent strokes. I dont get paid for taking care of her so I can't quit my job.

Tldr, it's not important. I don't really expect any help anymore. ",13,1743957315.0,CaregiverSupport,7,1.0,False

She really cares about her cat and how he's feeling. I'm sure she could play with him more, but besides that, he's well taken care of and loved.

My roommate started dating maybe a year and a half ago (just one or two dates a week), and the days around her dates, her cat would get agitated and vocal. She stopped spending the night with her dates, which helped a bit, but I think still not getting to spend time with her in the evening stresses him out. And if she has to go out the next morning for any reason, it makes that stress worse.

Lately, she's also had dates over here. Just having them over for the evening makes him huffy, even if not stressed. But when they stay over, he freaks out. For example, a date stayed over last night and the cat meowed when I got home that evening, and every time I went into a room without him. I'm allergic to cats, so it's the norm for him to not be allowed in my room and all that. He cried intermittently through the night, and this morning his meowing was almost constant, especially when my roommate went out to grab coffee. Now she's back and he's meowing again and crying when she goes to the bathroom.

I've done my best to try to help him feel better on date days. I always feed him at his usual time if my roommate won't be home. And I can't pet him, but can play. The only problem is, I struggle keeping my energy up, and when I play with him he expects it all the time, meowing when I don't play with him. I simply can't keep up with his demand.

The internet says to not give him attention when he meows, but it's getting to the point that I just can't stand it anymore. I feel like he should be used to all this by now. How can we get him to calm down?",15,1743957275.0,CatAdvice,16,0.9,False
1jsy7dh,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimAcademics/comments/1jsy7dh/how_islam_saved_western_civilization_dr_roy/,How Islam Saved Western Civilization - Dr. Roy Casagrande,"**How Islam Saved Western Civilization - Lecture Summary**

**1. Introduction and Setting Up the Contradictions (00:00:03 - 00:09:10)**

Dr. Roy Casagrande begins by admitting he nested a deliberate contradiction in the title ""How Islam Saved Western Civilization"" (00:00:33)

He draws inspiration from the book ""How the Irish Saved Civilization,"" which he criticizes as deeply flawed (00:01:02)

Casagrande identifies two major contradictions in the book (00:01:20):

The claim that Rome fell on September 4, 476 AD, when it actually fell on May 29, 1453 (00:02:05)

The premise that Irish monks converted ""Pagan Germanic tribesmen"" to Christianity, when most Germanic people were already Christian (00:02:36)

He notes that many Germanic tribes were Arian Christians rather than mainstream Orthodox Christians (00:03:18)

References to the Council of Nicaea (325 AD) where Emperor Constantine gathered 318 theologians to standardize Christianity (00:03:38)

Explanation of the Arian heresy: Jesus was pure God with no human attributes versus orthodox view that Jesus was God in human form who experienced temptation (00:06:36)

Discussion of how Americans and Europeans misunderstand their own religious history, using ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" controversy as an example (00:07:42)

**2. Redefining Western Civilization's Origins (00:09:10 - 00:25:40)**

Criticism of Western Civilization courses for condensing 5,400 years of history (from Mesopotamia to the 30 Years War) into one semester, while covering just 400 years of recent history in another semester (00:09:19)

Observation that typical Western Civilization courses give disproportionate attention to Greece and Rome while minimizing the foundational contributions of Mesopotamia and Egypt (00:11:27)

Argument that Egypt is fundamentally connected to Western Civilization: ""Western Civilization started on the banks of the Euphrates, the Tigris, and the Nile"" (00:14:35)

Comparison of timelines to emphasize Egypt's historical depth: Egypt was already 4,000 years old when Julius Caesar was massacring Gauls (00:22:53)

Discussion of Alexander the Great viewing the pyramids which were already 2,300 years old in his time - the same distance in time from us to Alexander (00:23:21)

Observation that 85-90% of musical instruments were invented by ancient Egyptians, with most others invented by Persians (00:24:00)

Example of the bagpipe, which originated in Mesopotamia before being adopted by the Celts (00:24:16)

**3. The East-West Paradigm and Its Flaws (00:25:40 - 00:35:40)**

Critique of the artificial ""East-West"" division created by English colonialism (00:28:03)

Explanation of how geographic terminology shifted during the Cold War:

Original British terms: Near East (today's Middle East), Middle East (South Asia), Far East (East Asia) (00:30:31)

How Americans repurposed these terms during the Cold War to make Russia ""the East"" (00:30:57)

Discussion of how this naming scheme effectively ""divorced"" places like East Germany from Western civilization in people's minds (00:31:52)

Connections to Edward Said's concept of Orientalism: portraying the East as irrational, inefficient, and authoritarian while depicting the West as democratic and liberated (00:32:33)

Reference to pop culture examples like ""The Man in the High Castle"" and ""Downton Abbey"" to illustrate how we categorize people (00:33:20)

**4. The Complexity of Identity (00:35:40 - 00:53:40)**

Story of a conversation with a Coptic Egyptian woman who identified as ""an Easterner"" despite Egypt being central to Western civilization (00:35:55)

Personal anecdote about the speaker's Swedish-Finnish ancestry to illustrate how identity is constructed and often misunderstood (00:36:20)

Discussion of how Americans describe presidential identity: Kennedy as ""the first Irish president"" despite many earlier presidents having Irish ancestry (00:37:37)

Example of technology attribution: the steam engine was invented by Heron of Alexandria in Egypt 2,000 years ago, not by later European inventors (00:43:50)

Discussion of Heron's other inventions: a static rocket and a mechanical play with gears, essentially a mechanical television (00:47:55)

Example of Thales, the ""Greek"" who invented philosophy but was actually Phoenician from Lebanon (00:57:06)

Story of Cleopatra, perceived as Egyptian but genetically Greek with extreme inbreeding in her ancestry (00:54:24)

**5. The Mediterranean as Connector, Not Divider (00:53:40 - 01:01:40)**

Argument that Western civilization has geographical boundaries but they're not what we typically think (00:58:52)

Proposal that the Indus River could be considered the eastern boundary of Western civilization (00:59:10)

Crucial point: the Mediterranean Sea functioned as a connector rather than a divider of civilizations (00:59:42)

Explanation of how sea transport was more efficient than land transport for moving goods and people (01:00:40)

Discussion of pantheons and monotheistic/henotheistic religions as elements of Western civilization (01:01:51)

Clarification that ancient Judaism was initially henotheistic (believing in one god for themselves while acknowledging other gods exist) rather than monotheistic (01:02:12)

**6. Foundations and Transmission of Knowledge (01:01:40 - 01:22:20)**

The 18th Dynasty of Egypt created the world's first empire that stretched across multiple countries (01:03:54)

Description of ancient Egyptian innovations: convenience industries, census-taking, extensive chronicling of daily life (01:04:33)

Discussion of Cyrus the Great of Persia issuing the world's first Bill of Rights around 539 BCE (01:07:46)

Detail about how Cyrus rebuilt the Temple of Solomon using Persian gold and Egyptian engineers (01:10:19)

Development of philosophy from Thales to Athens, including the often omitted role of Aspasia as Socrates' teacher (01:10:42)

Description of the Great Library of Alexandria: established by Ptolemy I Soter as a world repository of information housing up to one million books (01:13:19)

The Great Library included the first ""museum"" which was a repository of advanced technology, not art (01:13:47)

The destruction of the Great Library ordered by Archbishop Theophilus after Emperor Theodosius declared Christianity the only permitted religion in 391 AD (01:16:38)

**7. Islam's Preservation and Advancement of Knowledge (01:22:20 - 01:38:00)**

Description of the Persian Emperor Shapur's creation of an academy at Gundeshapur that collected books from Greek, Chinese, and Indian sources (01:22:47)

Account of how Roman Emperor Justinian banned the Academy of Athens in 529 AD, forcing scholars to flee to Persia with their books (01:24:11)

The rise of Islam beginning in 632 AD and the rapid conquest of territories from Pakistan to Spain by 711 AD (01:24:50)

Unlike previous conquerors, Arabs maintained religious freedom and incorporated local expertise (01:26:19)

When Arabs conquered Gundeshapur, they embraced its knowledge repository, asking Persians to teach them (01:27:23)

Al-Kindi began translating Greek texts into Arabic in the 8th century, making knowledge accessible to a broader population (01:27:41)

Al-Khwarizmi's crucial mathematical innovations: algebra, Arabic numerals, and algorithms (his name is the origin of the word) (01:28:00)

**8. Islamic Scientific and Philosophical Innovations (01:38:00 - 01:54:00)**

Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) wrote the Book of Optics in 1021, establishing the scientific method and discovering that light travels in waves at finite speed (01:38:00)

Description of agricultural innovations: Arabs invented crop rotation, introduced coffee cultivation, and developed refrigeration techniques for shipping fresh food (01:39:22)

Urban infrastructure: streets lit with oil lamps at night, fresh water pumped in, sewage pumped out (01:40:00)

Ibn Khaldun developed systematic approaches to history, sociology, politics, and demographics - effectively founding the social sciences (01:42:58)

Maimonides resurrected the Hebrew language by applying Arabic grammar to Hebrew vocabulary (01:43:12)

Ibn Sina (Avicenna) decoded Aristotle's idioms, theorized about the origin of the universe (similar to the Big Bang theory), and revolutionized medicine (01:45:36)

Ibn Sina's medical innovations: identifying different diseases with different transmission vectors and emphasizing prevention over treatment (01:48:00)

**9. The Transmission to European Renaissance (01:54:00 - 02:02:12)**

Debunking of the ""Dark Ages"" narrative: while Europe experienced intellectual decline, the Islamic world flourished (01:54:09)

Ibn al-Haytham described Newton's first law of motion and Kepler's first law of planetary motion centuries before Newton and Kepler (01:56:15)

Connection between Ibn Sina's philosophy and 20th-century phenomenology through Husserl and Heidegger (01:57:40)

Story of Benedictine and Dominican monks secretly preserving Arabic books while pretending to burn them during the Spanish Reconquista (01:59:00)

These monks translated works from Arabic to Greek and Latin, preserving Plato and Aristotle for European audiences (02:00:39)

The Renaissance began around 1300 after Crusaders returned having seen the advanced Islamic civilization with ""indoor plumbing and Medicine and crop rotation"" (02:01:19)

Dr. Casagrande's conclusion: ""Islam didn't necessarily save something that it wasn't - it saved itself, it just took it to a new level. The Arabs weren't doing something that was alien to them; they were part of western civilization."" (02:06:38)

**10. Q&A Section (02:02:12 - 02:12:59)**

Discussion of how Frederick II of Sicily embraced Arabic culture, spoke multiple languages including Arabic, and studied Islamic science (02:02:20)

Explanation of how tacos evolved from shawarma through Spanish conquest of Mexico and later Arab immigration (02:09:00)

Response to why Christianity rejected philosophy while Islam embraced it: Christianity faced decline and despair while Islam was in a period of vigor and expansion (02:10:40)

Warning about current trends of banning books in places like Texas: ""We've seen this play before...and you're not gonna like it."" (02:12:57)

**Conclusion**

Dr. Roy Casagrande's lecture challenges conventional narratives about Western civilization by demonstrating the integral role of Middle Eastern, particularly Islamic, contributions to what we now call ""Western"" knowledge and culture. He argues that the artificial East-West divide created through colonialism and orientalism has obscured the true origins and development of civilization. Rather than Islam ""saving"" Western civilization, Casagrande suggests that Islamic civilization was Western civilization during Europe's intellectual decline, preserving and dramatically advancing knowledge in mathematics, medicine, astronomy, philosophy, and technology. The lecture emphasizes the interconnectedness of human knowledge and the danger of creating artificial divisions between cultures that share common intellectual heritage.

My fearful avoidant ex returned during one of the hardest moments of my life‚Äîafter I‚Äôd been wrongfully jailed by a partner who tried to control me. When he ghosted again, I responded differently: with strength, love, and no self-abandonment. I told him I still loved him‚Äîwithout chasing, without begging. I even sent him a piece of art I unknowingly created before he pulled away again‚Ä¶ and it visually captured the exact moment. It was a prophecy.
This time, I didn‚Äôt lose myself. I reclaimed myself.


MESSAGES TRANSCRIPT:



ME: (My initial message about espresso‚Äîwith a photo) 

Built myself a little espresso altar... quad shots and quiet mornings.
Btw...l'm back at the house. Order is still technically in place, just modified enough to exist without drama.
Not repeating patterns. Just making strong coffee annd stronger boundaries.
Also, (coffee shop) totally hits different in memory... but this'll do for now. Just thought l'd share because you're literally the only person I could think of that would appreciate this! Maybe one day I can create some espresso magic for ya! Happy Monday!


HIS RESPONSE: 

I'm sorry that you're choosing this path for yourself. I really wish you the best.
However, it's a decision that I will say is a poor pattern for you. Having said this, I can't say that I can assist you any further in friendship as time goes forward. I hope things pan out for the best and you can have a great life and adventures around the sun while you're in bloom...
Thanks for some fun summer memories and dont stop creating harmonic things ‚úåÔ∏è.

ME (the fire): 

You read what you needed to, not what I said.
I want to be clear here‚ÄîI‚Äôm not back with (ex that sent me to jail) . I‚Äôm back in the house I fought for. A space I legally co-own, after being wrongfully arrested, gaslit, isolated, and discarded. I went back to rebuild, so I can find a way out‚Äînot to repeat. 
But instead of asking, instead of checking in, you assumed the worst of me and wrapped it in some poetic ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù You didn‚Äôt offer concern.
You offered distance dressed as wisdom. 
But let‚Äôs be honest‚Ä¶
you were looking for an exit.
And my healing gave you one.
I wasn‚Äôt reaching out for help.
I was sharing something simple, human‚Äîa cup of espresso.
A memory. A soft thread back to something that once meant something. And you replied like it was a problem to solve,
like I was the problem again. I loved you‚Ä¶and honestly, in some strange stupid way, I still love you‚Ä¶Not in some clinging,reckless way‚Äîbut in the way a part of me just‚Ä¶stays. 
Because when something real carves its name in you, you don‚Äôt rip it out. You learn to live with the thoughts of what could have been‚Ä¶
But you don‚Äôt get to call yourself my ‚Äòfriend‚Äô in a singular breath and shame me in the next.
I survived what most wouldn‚Äôt. And instead of seeing my strength, you assumed I was back in the trenches. 
That says everything about you.
NOT me. And (FA‚Äôs Name)‚Ä¶
there is no pattern here.
Not the one you projected. 
Not the one you convinced yourself to believe so you could bow out without guilt. Just the story youu keep telling yourself
to avoid facing the truth‚Ä¶that I‚Äôve had the strength to walk away from far worse than your silence.
You didn‚Äôt expect me to survive.
You didn‚Äôt expect me to land on my feet.
Maybe you thought I‚Äôd be stuck, stranded, needing rescue.

But here‚Äôs the reality: 

I didn‚Äôt wait to be saved.
I saved myself. 
So no‚Ä¶
there‚Äôs no pattern here.
Just a woman who keeps rising
while you keep mistaking light for danger.
And next time someone reaches out in tenderness, try listening before you write them off. Because I was never a pattern.

I was a fucking lighthouse.

And just so you know‚Ä¶
the light‚Äôs still shining.
But not for someone who won‚Äôt face it.



ME: (sends prophetic illustration and caption) 


I was going to share this with you anyway‚Ä¶
something I finished yesterday.
Didn‚Äôt realize I was creating a prophecy. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 
You, mid-turn‚Ä¶Me, still rooted.
Blindfolds, sure‚Äîbut the thread stayed lit‚Ä¶
It‚Äôs funny how art knows before we do thought you‚Äôd recognize the silhouette‚Ä¶

P.S. Next time I predict your exit, I‚Äôll add a disco ball and make it festive. üíÖ 



BACKGROUND:

We had a soulmate-level connection‚Äîmagnetic, creative, spiritual‚Ä¶ but unstable toward the end. I was anxiously attached, and he was a classic FA.
He loved deeply, then disappeared when things got too real.
It hurt like hell.
And honestly? It still hurt a year later.

After the breakup, I entered another relationship‚Äîone that mirrored my unhealed trauma. That partner ended up hitting me and wrongfully sending me to jail in an attempt to control me and take over the house we co-own. I lost my freedom, my housing, and‚Äîbriefly‚Äîmyself.

Then out of nowhere‚Ä¶ my ex showed up.
He spent four hours trying to get me out of jail.
That moment? That‚Äôs when I knew: he still loved me.

A few days later, I came across his old shirt‚Äîone we had both been searching for for over a year.
I found it at my dad‚Äôs house the day after I got out.
It felt like a sign.

I let him know I had it, thinking it‚Äôd be a quick ‚Äúhere‚Äôs your shirt and a book‚Äù goodbye.
But when he pulled up, he said:

‚ÄúGet in.‚Äù

I did.
And he took me to a creative studio he‚Äôs building‚Äîone we once dreamed of together.
I gave him the shirt and a signed copy of Yung Pueblo‚Äôs new book ‚ÄòHow to Love Better‚Äô.
He told me I deserved more.
That I shouldn‚Äôt go back to the house.
That maybe I could get a roommate.

I told him I legally co-own it, and that with my legal status post-jail, it‚Äôs the only place I can live and work safely.
Otherwise I lose everything I‚Äôve worked hard for.
He didn‚Äôt understand.
But in that moment‚Äîin his arms‚Äîit felt like home again.
Like something between us still hadn‚Äôt settled.
And when is it ever finished with an FA?

This one had never forgotten me. I had pierced through his defenses in a way no one else had.

But later, after finding out I was back in the house (without asking why), he ghosted.
No conversation.
No check-in.
Just a poetic ‚Äúgoodbye.‚Äù

But this time?

I didn‚Äôt collapse. I didn‚Äôt spiral. I didn‚Äôt beg.

I responded.
With full clarity. Full heart. Full self.

And I told him‚Äîwithout any pleading‚Äîthat I still loved him.

That line took immense courage.
To love someone and still hold your ground‚Ä¶that was the shift I never thought I‚Äôd reach a year ago.

I also sent him a digital art piece I had finished the night before he sent the goodbye.
I had no idea what I was illustrating at the time.

Two blindfolded figures.
His silhouette mid-turn.
Mine rooted, steady, still glowing.
Still tethered by light.
It was a prophecy. Or something close to it.

My art knew before I did.

If you‚Äôre healing your attachment style, or navigating a painful breakup this is for you:

You can still love someone and not abandon yourself.
You can express your heart without losing your footing.
You can be soft and powerful at the same time.
And remember YOU are the fucking lighthouse!

That is my Question

What do you think a normal Uneventful days is like with Frieren and Team both with Legendary Heroes and her current team

Because even someone like Frieren has a Normal Day like Normal Normal if you get what I mean and what do you think happens with Frieren and Team in a day like that it's probably very hilarious like half the time specially Frieren being Frieren I wonder what Fern and Stark do before Frieren gets up 

It's an interesting thought I mean Spider-man when going on patrol he doesn't always fight Super Villains some days is just fighting regular criminals or Henchmen drinking at Bar with no Name 

How you It's like for Frieren and the other characters and why?

Please put Spoiler Bars on any Manga Spoilers

So Lets do this and wake up and get a cup of coffee

It's Reddit dating so I'm naturally insanely ADD, I breathe coffee and Vyvanse. I'm a full time wage slave and between that and the rest of life's demands I have sparse time and mental energy for dating which has always been something of a challenge for me, but I do think I'm a good partner. That said, it's really important that you're understanding and compatible of the fact I need space and lots of time to recover socially. I love attention and affection from my partner so I of course understand the needs there, but I am in a constant battle against burnout pretty much 99% of my life so be warned it's not unusual for me to be short lol when I am it's nothing personal I just get really chronic awful brain fog (I hate texting, if you're a big texter and require it of your partner, I'm not for you).

I'm ethical poly and fwb friendly, that is, I'm open to any kind of relationship depending on how well we hit it off, share interests, and of course what makes us happy. I'll be honest and say that while it's not the goal here, I \*can\* completely enjoy relationships that are all about bedroom activity more or less, it's pretty rare that I do craft meaningful relationships with people as my interests are just very niche and not really two player. I like to read, cook, and take in artsy fartsy film and music when time permits. Drinking coffee on a mildly temperate morning is the best.

In all likelihood if we are to be deeply personally intimate you will probably have to be very interested in radical left revolutionary politics cause it just dominates my thoughts basically all the time. Free Palestine, f the police, abolish capitalism yadda yadda yadda. Alternatively, you'll just need to have your own interests and be able to keep yourself entertained (I am a big proponent of parallel play lawl)

I am almost entirely debt free outside of the mortgage on my home (outside of my 2 cats I do live alone) and like to think I'm pretty responsible and tidy. Outside of that and work, I spend lots of time taking care of a couple close family members mostly for health reasons that render them needy of lots of assistance with daily life upkeep. I'm a busy boy (sob).

Physically I'm 5'8 and hover around 150 pounds. I'm on the slender side, and fancy myself sort of a pretty boy. I'd love to get more into fashion and hairstyling as I am pretty clueless in both but think a makeover would do me pretty wonderfully. If you like to gussy people up please feel free to chat me ha. Anyway, I got shoulder length brown hair, and big ol eyes of an even darker shade of brown that I get complimented on by virtually all partners I end up with (they are dreamy and I do not blame them u.u). I do not tan and have pretty fair complexion, and yeah I think that's a suitable description. Bleh on the subject of your own appearance, I'm not the pickiest person, lots of looks can work, but if you're overly heavyset it probably won't work for me (sorry)

Anyway, I guess this probably reads pretty mechanical, so apologies about that, I do like to think when there's time for it I'm a sweet and goofy, easy-going person, and I'm proud of hell of myself.

Have had a really good life by working with myself. 

Two years ago I had serious stomach issues and had to quit my coffee. My life fell into a real problem. So tired, slept a lot, no focus, it was a mess. 

Trying to listen to people and I would just space out. I lost a friend of 45 years. Actually not that big a loss, she got bitter about life and it was hard to listen to her anyway. I had been self medicating with coffee for decades. 

Ended up at a psychologist and got diagnosed with Inattentive ADHD and dyscalculia on top of the dyslexic. 

We had a talk. I did not want drugs. My mother forced me to take stimulants as a teen for my supposed overweight (15 lbs) Messed me up for years. I could not go back to coffee because of my stomach simply would not tolerate it. 

This is what got me always removed from the other ADHD sub when I really wanted to talk with others. My therapist recommended a combination of Theanine and Caffeine in a pill form. Is working wonderfully. The other site will not allow you to talk about anything but drugs. So will see if I get thrown off this one too!!!!!",3,1743956529.0,adhdwomen,7,0.8,False

The dating apps are making me question my own sanity/rationality at this point.

I‚Äôve had someone ask me if I wanted to go on a walking date the same day. We‚Äôve had zero conversation and his profile is pretty much a blank slate (apart from pictures). I think I like the idea of spontaneity more than actually doing something spontaneous. But I‚Äôm struggling to comprehend this because one of my ADHD traits is impulsivity.

For me, I actively hate walking without a destination/purpose, but the fact that you don‚Äôt have to maintain eye contact sounds good, which is why I‚Äôm torn. At the same time, the amount of time and effort it would take me to get ready is significant and the lack of explanation of the plan doesn‚Äôt fill me with the desire to go.

Normally, I go on sit down dates i.e. drinks or dinner as I can look at the menu/venue and plan accordingly. But I‚Äôm wondering if I should change tact.

I just recently started on medication for the first time. On methylphenidate instant release, 5mg three times daily. 

I was very reluctant to try medication so I‚Äôm happy taking it very low and slow on this dose for now. 

Spirituality is very important to me and frankly one of the main reasons I‚Äôm still here to this day. 

Something that had become a big part of my daily routines was drinking ceremonial grade cacao in ceremony, with my prayer time and other spiritual practices. 

Since starting on the meds I haven‚Äôt had any cacao as I wanted to lay off any other stimulants (that‚Äôs the only one I use anyway, I‚Äôm not a coffee/tea drinker) just to make sure I minimise any side effects etc. 

However now I‚Äôd love to incorporate it back into my day but I‚Äôm finding it impossible to find out if it‚Äôs OK with the meds or not. I have asked my psychiatrist and she said ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt really know what that is but I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be fine‚Äù, and asked the pharmacist who gave a similar answer. 

The issue is that I also have bad health anxiety so I‚Äôm worried without actually knowing it‚Äôs safe and it seems to be so hard to find out because no medical professionals actually understand what I mean when I say ceremonial cacao. 

Just wondering if there is anyone out there at all who has experience of cacao and has consumed it while on methylphenidate with no ill effects? Obviously not looking for medical advice of course, just if anyone has lived experience that could settle my anxiety about it.

I grew up there and have plenty of horror stories about my own addiction. Last summer I moved to Portland and although gambling is available here, I don‚Äôt feel the same amount of temptation. I‚Äôve been able to avoid gambling thankfully. I am on SSI (I have autism) and I don‚Äôt have much money, but I had managed to save up a little nest egg for myself by eating only generic foods, only eating at home, buying my coffee at dollar tree. It‚Äôs taken me months to save up a little over a thousand dollars. Well, yesterday my sister calls me up crying telling me that she gambled away $800 and she is afraid of how her husband will react when he finds out. He has been emotionally abusive and has broken things in the past. Although he hasn‚Äôt hit her yet, it seems entirely possible that he would. I didn‚Äôt want to give her the money but I felt like I was being backed into a corner. I didn‚Äôt know what to do. I sent her $800 on Apple Cash and I literally broke down in tears sobbing while I did it. It took me so long to save that money. Months of scrimping and saving, not to mention the fact that I haven‚Äôt gambled at all since I‚Äôve been in Portland. I feel like I‚Äôm cursed‚Ä¶I‚Äôm just not meant to have money. The second I finally save something for myself, the universe rips it away. I‚Äôve been crying on and off ever since. I can‚Äôt get over it. I pray and pray for the strength to let go, but that isn‚Äôt really helping either. I hate myself for valuing money so much, but I am absolutely devastated over this. Absolutely devastated. I‚Äôm going to call 988 today and I pray someone can talk me down from the ledge because I just feel so broken and tired and I just can‚Äôt bear this. I really can‚Äôt. I know there are people with real problems. People in the hospital. People who are dying. People who are suffering. I feel guilty for being so depressed over this when there are people who would love to trade places. I just can‚Äôt get myself out of this depression.
