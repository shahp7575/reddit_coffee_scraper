1gsm1d5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1gsm1d5/im_dreading_sunday_night/,I'm dreading Sunday night ...,"**A bit of context:** just finished week 9 on Oz, 3 months of which I have basically been immobile due to excruciating joint pain in my left knee. Finally had a cortisone shot last week & am slowly working on building back up the muscles & can only walk short distances. Sucks. As of last week I have lost 3kg in 2 months & but I am grateful for any weight loss at all! Meanwhile, I have just started a 4 week caravan holiday with husband. Tomorrow, Sunday is my fifth 0.5 shot (I have decided to stay on this over the holiday). However I'm worried...

Up to 2 weeks ago, I hadn't had any bad reactions, (apart from mild nausea) to my doses. I normally eat a healthy diet, no junk food, eat out little. Sunday 2 weeks ago (Week 3 of my 0.5 dose) was my birthday & it unfortunately was a bit of a food fest. Brunch with kids I had eggs benedict (with salmon), and later a Thai meal after a show with friends (I ate sparingly, tastes of pad thai, red duck curry, pork belly...). That night (fortunately after we got home) was terrible, awful cramps a veritable fountain at both ends, & a lonely night in the bathroom. Wrote it off to too much fatty food, lesson learned, moved on.   
  
Unfortunately it happened *again* the next (last) Sunday night after my shot. I had cooked a baked lamb for the family & mother in law, but had had literally 2 mouthfuls before deciding it was too fatty, & only ate the veges (baked with no oil/fat). I'm really at a loss to know what happened.

**Question:** tomorrow I again have my shot. We are in a caravan in a caravan park. The ammenities are a walk away & not a convenient few metres away from my bed at home. I obviously don't want have a miserable repeat of the last 2 Sundays. I am trying to prepare to eat really carefully tomorrow & really test if it is the food causing it. I'm hoping others with experience could give me some guidance, also noting that I'm limited with what is available in my caravan fridge/pantry in an isolated national park.

Breakfast: weatbix & lite milk, banana. Should I have flavoured lite yoghurt? Could dairy be a trigger?

Lunch: 2 hard boiled eggs (trying to stay away from cheese) for protein, a slice of toast or 2 with vegemite 

Dinner: lean chicken & salad

We also eat fruit as snacks between meals, especially apples & mandarins. I also have 2 or 3 coffees during the day.   
  
Are there any other suggestions? I have to say I'm dreading tomorrow night. I will report back on my  outcomes.... üò¨

1gslv1w,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anxiety/comments/1gslv1w/i_hate_this_feeling/,I hate this feeling.,"Hi. 

Last Tuesday I fell while at work. I hit the back of my head. I stumbled backwards and landed on stony ground. I didn't black out but I got scared because it's the head and my colleagues told me to better have it checked. Better safe than sorry and all that. So I went to the ER. The doc said I was fine and told me I was good to go and to come back if I needed to vomit or got a bad headache. So I went home and I was happy to be okay. Cue Wednesday morning. I grew nervous. I had a slight headache. When I wanted to eat something, I felt queasy. Back to the ER. They did a CT. Checked my head. All fine, the doc said. A bit of headache was fine, he said. I did hit my head after all. But no bleeding, no swelling. All was good. 

Since then, I feel like I'm in a constant state of panic. After returning home, I was good. I ate a little bit. I watched tv. I was tired and so I went to bed. And then the panic set it. I was quivering. I felt pressure in my head. Not pain, but a weird pressure. I was queasy. Hot. Cold. Wide awake and completely exhausted. I googled my headache and read it was stress. That calmed me down for a minute and eventually, my exhaustion won out and I fell asleep. Thursday, I went back to work. I barely ate since Tuesday. I forced myself to nibble on little things. I drank a diet coke hoping little sips of caffeine might get me back in shape. I used to drink a can of energy every day. Haven't had one since Monday. Thursday afternoon, I was so busy I forgot about my panic and the weird, light headache which came and went. 

Then there was a pain in my chest. Fresh panic set in. I remembered it from two years ago. It's a byproduct of panic. My heart is fine. To convince myself, I read it up online. I calmed down. My shift was done. I went home. I ate a little bit. I fell asleep.  Friday morning, the panic was back and it came with diarrhea. I went to work. I nibbled on a corner of dry bread. I sipped a bit of diet coke. I managed a slice of bread and small greek yogurt for lunch. By afternoon I was so busy I was feeling great. No troubles, no worries, no headache. I was elated. I came home. The silence hit. I forced myself to eat a little rice. I stayed up long hoping to fall asleep easier. Eventually, I fell asleep. 

It's Saturday today. I have off. I have nothing to do. I'm a few days before my period. My nerves are fried. I used to eat a lot of sugar. Have barely had any. I haven't had any energy drinks, no coffee. Sips of diet coke here and there. Logically, I know I'm okay. My panic keeps telling me otherwise. 

I hate this feeling. ",1,1731758584.0,Anxiety,0,1.0,False

When presented with a paper and a set containing pages of comments exchanged between an INTJ and multiple different INTPs, it transformed the scattered threads into a single, cohesive, and extended scene.

**INT. MONK'S CAFE ‚Äì DAY**

*Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer are at the booth. George enters, carrying a crumpled stack of papers. He slams them down on the table, causing Jerry‚Äôs coffee to spill slightly.*

**GEORGE:** (exasperated) I can‚Äôt take it anymore, Jerry! These people‚Äîthey‚Äôre ruining math! They want to tear it apart! Radicals? Gone! Parentheses? Optional! It‚Äôs madness!

**JERRY:** (wiping up his coffee) You spill coffee on my table to rant about parentheses? They're not saying it's optional George. Did you even read the Paper?

**ELAINE:** (snickering) You‚Äôre really this worked up over math, George? Who even uses math?

**GEORGE:** (glaring) Everybody, Elaine! Math is the foundation of civilization! It‚Äôs the glue that holds everything together! And now, some pencil-pushers with their ‚ÄúCanonical Order‚Äù want to rip it apart!

**KRAMER:** (excited) Canonical Order? Oh, I love it! It‚Äôs clean, it‚Äôs fresh, it‚Äôs bold! No more radicals, no more imaginary mumbo-jumbo‚Äîjust the raw, pure truth.

**GEORGE:** (side hair pushed out) Oh, you would love it, wouldn‚Äôt you? You‚Äôre always looking for the next thing, the new thing. Meanwhile, I‚Äôm out here fighting for stability, for tradition, for‚Ä¶ for order!

**JERRY:** (mocking) Oh because they're getting rid of PEMDAS. You, George Costanza are fighting for PEMDAS?

**GEORGE:** (nods) That‚Äôs right! For PEMDAS! It‚Äôs not just a rule‚Äîit‚Äôs a way of life! Parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division‚Äîit‚Äôs the natural order! The universe depends on it! Without PEMDAS, we‚Äôre just monkeys flinging numbers at each other!

**ELAINE TOGETHER:** (sarcastic) Oh no, not the natural order! Quick, everyone, call a mathematician‚ÄîGeorge is having a math emergency!

**JERRY TOGETHER:** George, no one is getting rid of PEMDAS, you clearly didn't read the paper because you would know that if you did. It could be groundbreaking stuff but you can't get yourself to be open minded and change. 

**GEORGE:** (scoffing) Groundbreaking? Please. You know what‚Äôs groundbreaking? The Taylor series. Trigonometry. The things that actually work. Not this... whatever this is. Canonical? Sounds made-up. It's complete and utter nonsense!

**JERRY:** (dryly) Yeah, because Taylor just dropped out of the sky and handed you a calculator.

**ELAINE:** (leaning forward) If it‚Äôs so ‚Äúnonsense,‚Äù why don‚Äôt you refute it, huh? Give us a solid reason why it‚Äôs wrong.

**GEORGE:** (stammering) I‚ÄîI don‚Äôt need to refute it. The burden of proof is on them! They‚Äôre the ones trying to change everything. I‚Äôm just defending common sense here!

**JERRY:** (leaning back, smirking) Common sense? You‚Äôre defending the status quo like it‚Äôs the Ten Commandments. ‚ÄúThou shalt not mess with PEMDAS.‚Äù

**GEORGE:** (pointing at Jerry) That‚Äôs not true! I don‚Äôt uphold the status quo! I‚Äôm just saying, if it‚Äôs not broken, don‚Äôt fix it!

**ELAINE:** (rolling her eyes) It is broken, George. That‚Äôs the point. You just don‚Äôt want to admit it because it means you‚Äôd have to rethink everything you‚Äôve ever learned.

**GEORGE:** (ignoring them) You know what this Canonical Order is? It‚Äôs chaos. They‚Äôre saying imaginary numbers are confusing for students to learn! Confusing? Imaginary numbers are elegant! Beautiful, even! It's their own damn fault that those kids don't like math.

**ELAINE:** (grinning) Oh, come on, George. You‚Äôre clinging to the old ways! You just love the status quo. You‚Äôre such a status quoter! A quoter of status quo. The king of status quo! You‚Äôre like the guy on the dock shouting at a steamship, ‚ÄúBring back the sails! The wind was better!""

**GEORGE:** I am NOT a status quoter!

**KRAMER:** (nodding with a smirk) Oh, you‚Äôre a status quoter, alright. (gestures dramatically) The poster boy for status quo! Big time!

**GEORGE:** I just believe in systems that work! And guess what? The current one works perfectly, my friends.

**ELAINE:** (mocking) Oh, sure. Nothing screams ‚Äúperfect‚Äù like parentheses preventing you from botching a negative.

**JERRY:** (leaning in) George!

**GEORGE:** (snapping) What?

**JERRY:** Did you even read the paper, or did you just get mad at the abstract?

**GEORGE:** (indignant) I read it! Oh, I read it... And I laughed‚Äî*ho-ho!*‚Äî(claps hands diagonally) all the way through, Jerry. It‚Äôs the same nonsense you see everywhere: that same incoherent drivel. ‚ÄúOh, let‚Äôs reinvent math! Let‚Äôs rewrite the rules! Let‚Äôs make everything so convoluted, nobody knows what‚Äôs going on! Especially poor little Georgie in Fifth Grade!‚Äù

**ELAINE:** (rolling her eyes) You didn‚Äôt read it.

**GEORGE:** (panicking) I did too! I read enough to know it‚Äôs all vehemence! Who even uses fractional exponents in real life? You‚Äôre not sitting in a meeting and saying, ‚ÄúOh, let me just take the cube root of negative eight real quick!‚Äù

**KRAMER:** (smiling) That‚Äôs the beauty of it, buddy. No more radical symbols! You just write it as a fractional exponent. Boom‚Äîinstant clarity! Kids can grasp it almost immediately. You raise 5 to the power of 5, you get 625. Then you raise it to the power of 1 divided by that same power‚Äî5‚Äîand bam! Back to 5, baby!

**GEORGE:** (yelling) Instant clarity? You think clarity is writing negative numbers with fractions? You think clarity is deleting parentheses?! That‚Äôs not clarity‚Äîthat‚Äôs anarchy!

**JERRY:** (mocking) ‚ÄúFirst they came for the radicals, and I said nothing‚Ä¶‚Äù

**ELAINE:** (laughing) ‚ÄúThen they came for the parentheses, and I was silent!‚Äù

**GEORGE:** (ignoring them) You know what this is, Jerry? It‚Äôs academic elitism. These Canonical people think they‚Äôre better than everyone else because they can turn a square root into a fraction. Meanwhile, the rest of us are stuck trying to figure out how the hell this makes any sense. What the hell is ‚Å∂‚àö(‚Å∑‚àö(5‚Å∏)) = 5\^(4/21) anyway? It's nonsense.

**JERRY:** Oh, first it was chaos, now it's elitism. Just face it George! You‚Äôre stuck. Stuck in the old PEMDAS mud. You gotta dig yourself out! Show the world that you are not afraid to be wrong.

**GEORGE:** (glaring at Kramer) I‚Äôm not stuck! I‚Äôm practical! There‚Äôs a difference! I'm not wrong. 

*George sits down, defeated but still muttering about radicals and parentheses. Kramer pats him on the back, Jerry sips his coffee, and Elaine flips through her phone, pretending not to listen as George starts scribbling ‚ÄúGeorge Order‚Äù on the napkin.*

**GEORGE:** (muttering to himself) George Order‚Ä¶ Parentheses always. Radicals forever. No fractions. That‚Äôs math. That‚Äôs real math. I'll show them.

**INT. MONK‚ÄôS CAFE ‚Äì LATER**

Later. George and Kramer are now using the Cafe's Whiteboard, furiously scribbling numbers and exponents. Kramer is trying to explain the Canonical Order to him, while Jerry and Elaine watch from the booth.

**KRAMER:** (pointing at the board) See, George? It‚Äôs simple! Raise the base to the power of 111, use the power-of-a-power rule to remove the parentheses, and‚Äîbam!‚Äîno need for imaginary numbers!

**GEORGE:** (muttering) No need for imaginary numbers‚Ä¶ no need for radicals‚Ä¶ You might as well say there‚Äôs no need for coffee or electricity while you‚Äôre at it!

**JERRY:** (to Elaine) He‚Äôs having a breakdown. Over math.

**ELAINE:** (nodding) It‚Äôs kind of impressive, actually. Most people don‚Äôt even care about this stuff.

**GEORGE:** (turning toward them yelling) I care! I care because math is sacred! You don‚Äôt just rewrite the rules because you feel like it!

**KRAMER:** (calmly) Nobody‚Äôs rewriting the rules, buddy. They‚Äôre just cleaning them up. There's still radicals. They're just using the very old representation that is clearer.

**GEORGE:** Oh, cleaning them up, huh? You think Einstein needed the Canonical Order? Newton? No! They did just fine with PEMDAS!

**JERRY:** (mocking) Yeah, George. I‚Äôm sure Einstein was calculating the square root of -4 and thinking, ‚ÄúMan, I hope nobody changes the radicals. That would really bum me out.‚Äù

**GEORGE:** Look! (journeys to the whiteboard) It‚Äôs simple! (-5)¬≤ = (-5)(-5) = 25! Case closed! Why are we still talking about this? Are you dumb?

**JERRY:** (smirking) George, you‚Äôre doing it again. You‚Äôre just repeating what you‚Äôve been taught without looking at the logic behind it.

**KRAMER:** (patting George on the back) Don‚Äôt hurt yourself, George. It‚Äôs just math.

**ELAINE:** (smirking) Yeah, George. You‚Äôre gonna have to let go of those radicals someday.

**GEORGE:** Never! Parentheses AND radicals forever! Radicals forever! Canonical Order is a lie!

**JERRY:** (laughing) Oh, that‚Äôs rich. George Costanza, defender of global stability. Look, operators don't affect operators. (-5) \* 2 is not (-5)(-5) and further equals -10 and not 10, so why is (-5)\^2? Watch, this is how you do it.

**GEORGE:** (slamming the table) No! No, no, no! It‚Äôs still (-5)(-5) = 25! You just have to know the rules! It's elementary for God's sake!

**ELAINE:** (laughing) Oh, so now it‚Äôs a memory test? ‚ÄúMath: The Trivia Game‚Äù?

**GEORGE:** (pointing at her) Don‚Äôt you start, Elaine! Parentheses work! They‚Äôve always worked!

**JERRY:** (shrugging) Except when they aren't used properly. Which is the point, George. You can't just add parentheses yet, a huge issue in America and in Europe is that adults after high school are mostly under the impression that parentheses can just be added at will.

**GEORGE:** (stammering) That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs just how it is! That's why -5 squared is 25 because -5^(2) = (-5)(-5) = 25. Just like you can‚Äôt undo a square root with a negative!

**JERRY:** (mocking) So, what? We just throw our hands up and say, ‚ÄúMath is weird‚Äù? That‚Äôs your argument? And you‚Äôre wrong, George. It was never about ‚Äúa negative times a negative cancels.‚Äù It‚Äôs that two negatives cancel in context, but some guy thought the other way sounded easier for students. How can you be a defender of the system and not understand that -5¬≤ and (-5)¬≤ are fundamentally different?

**GEORGE:** (yelling) I was just testing you, ah, ha, to see if you knew it. If you knew it, Jerry, then why don't you understand that this is wrong. And YES! Math is weird, Jerry! It‚Äôs supposed to be weird! You don‚Äôt fix it by rewriting the rules! You just live with it!

**ELAINE:** (smirking) And how do you ‚Äúlive with it,‚Äù George? By pretending the problems don‚Äôt exist? (Looks at Jerry and Kramer) Actually, this is starting to explain a lot about you.

**GEORGE:** (ignoring and waving his napkin) No! By following the rules! PEMDAS, radicals, parentheses‚Äîthey‚Äôve gotten us this far! You start messing with them, and the whole system collapses!

**KRAMER:** (leaning in, wiping the board) Not so fast, Georgie boy. Let‚Äôs break it down. The Canonical Order says every base is implicitly raised to the power of 1 unless specified. So (-5)¬≤ isn‚Äôt just (-5)(-5), it‚Äôs (-5¬π)¬≤ = -5¬π\*¬≤ = -5¬≤ = -25. 

**GEORGE:** (snapping) The Canon- What kind of voodoo math is that?! That‚Äôs not how we learned it in school! It's the Order of Operations. Not the Standard Order! Not the Canonical Order! Not the Kramer Order! Its the George Order!

**ELAINE:** (rolling her eyes) Yeah, because school also taught us Pluto was a planet, George. Times change. Get with it. Radicals are nonsense anyway. 

**GEORGE:** (gripping his head) Nonsense? Nonsense?! Radicals are iconic! They‚Äôre a cornerstone of math! You can‚Äôt just throw them out because you think fractions are prettier, and more understandable !

**JERRY:** (mocking) ‚ÄúRadicals are iconic.‚Äù You know you‚Äôre starting to sound like a guy passionately defending bell-bottoms, right? Nobody cares this much, George. This is so simple even your grandma could figure it out.

**GEORGE:** SHE‚ÄôS DEAD!

*(Jerry cringes, glancing awkwardly at the others as the scene fades out.)*

**INT. MONK'S CAFE ‚Äì NIGHT**

George storms back into the cafe, napkin in hand, pacing wildly around the booth as Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer exchange knowing glances.

**GEORGE:** (waving the napkin) No! You don‚Äôt just rewrite the laws of math! Who do these people think they are? Nope, nope, nope! It‚Äôs still (-5)(-5) = 25! See this proves it. How is that hard for you to understand? That‚Äôs how it works! You don‚Äôt ‚Äúremove‚Äù parentheses! The parentheses are there because they *mean something*! They‚Äôre telling us the base is negative!

**KRAMER:** (leaning back) Actually, Georgie, the parentheses don‚Äôt make the base negative‚Äîthey‚Äôre just there to group the base so you don‚Äôt confuse yourself. The negative is just hanging out until you use it, like me in the morning before coffee. It‚Äôs not attached to anything. I thought you read the paper.

**GEORGE:** (glaring at Kramer) I did! Most of it! I saw what I needed and found it to be absolute drivel. And this, Kramer, is not coffee! This is math! If you take away the parentheses, how do you even know what‚Äôs happening? You‚Äôre leaving it up to the interpretation of‚Ä¶ of maniacs!

**JERRY:** (dryly) Oh, right. Math needs George Costanza to save it from the maniacs. What a headline.

**ELAINE:** (mocking) ‚ÄúLocal man fights radicals‚Ä¶ and loses.‚Äù

**GEORGE:** You laugh, but I‚Äôm the only one here fighting for common sense! Math needs rules! Structure! Without it, what‚Äôs left? Numbers doing whatever they want? Chaos, Elaine! Chaos!

**KRAMER:** (grinning, gesturing to his whiteboard) You know what‚Äôs chaos, George? Pretending (-5)¬≤ = 25. You just have to follow the rules, George. There weren‚Äôt two negatives to cancel out in the first place. Where did the energy go? Math isn‚Äôt a closed system, but there‚Äôs no way to return that energy. How do you turn (-5)¬≤ back into (-5) without explicitly adding a negative? You can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs against the laws of thermodynamics!  

**GEORGE:** (throwing up his hands) Laws?! Rules?! That‚Äôs not rules‚Äîthat‚Äôs wordplay! It‚Äôs a math trick! A gimmick! Nobody actually does it that way!

**JERRY:** (mocking) Yeah, George. The order of operations. You‚Äôve heard of that, right?

**GEORGE:** (yelling) I KNOW THE ORDER OF OPERATIONS! Parentheses, exponents, multiplication, division, addition, subtraction! I learned it in the third grade! We've spent all day discussing it. Have you lost your minds? Perhaps it is too difficult for you all to comprehend how the Order of Operations work. 

**ELAINE:** (leaning in) Then you should know parentheses don‚Äôt mean ‚Äúmultiply by itself.‚Äù They‚Äôre just there to group the base. Once you remove them, you‚Äôre left with (-10¬π)¬≤ = -10¬π\*¬≤ = -10¬≤ = -100. Yet we have to keep telling you because you won't read the contents of the paper. It‚Äôs not new math, George‚Äîit‚Äôs the original math.

**GEORGE:** (desperate) Original math?! Who cares?! I like my math the way it is! So what if the Canonical Order is ‚Äúright‚Äù? Convention is convention is convention, Elaine! What are we supposed to do‚Äîgo back and rediscover everything? Fix every calculation ever made? Who‚Äôs going to do that, huh? (points at Kramer) You?

**KRAMER:** (grinning) Maybe.

**GEORGE:** (ignoring her) And what about the engineers, huh? The programmers? You think they‚Äôre just going to switch overnight? You think they‚Äôre going to throw out PEMDAS because some guy with a whiteboard said so?!

**JERRY:** (smirking) George, no one is getting rid of PEMDAS. This is literally PEMDAS. You‚Äôd know that if you‚Äôd just read the damn paper.

*George storms out, muttering to himself about parentheses and radicals. Jerry, Elaine, and Kramer exchange amused glances.*

**JERRY:** (sipping his coffee) You think he‚Äôs going to write a manifesto?

**ELAINE:** (laughing) Oh, definitely. ‚ÄúThe George Order: Parentheses Forever. Radicals Forever. Chaos Never. The Imaginary World Saved.‚Äù

**KRAMER:** (nodding) And I bet he still never reads the paper.

*The camera pans out as George storms down the street, yelling at no one in particular about the sanctity of PEMDAS.*

*Fade to black.*

I recently came into possession of an old mac mini, 2007 model with 1.83ghz cpu and 1gb of ram. I replaced the old HDD with a brand new totally used SSD. I have no love for MacOS, so my first idea was to install linux on it. So how did that go?

Hell is a pleasure cruise compared to the journey I have had with this thing so far.

1. Raspberry Pi Desktop, my goto distro for older hardware, gave me multiple errors during install, including low memory for the installer, unable to install bootloader, and unable to change the disk (partitions and the like).

2. Libreelec didn't even launch the installer.

3. Android x86 was able to install at first, and it boots into a screen from that OS now, but the actual install/setup just freezes or crashes, not sure what is going on there.

4. Batocera didn't even recognize the usb (but I might have ran out of patience at this point, and it might be that the image turns the usb into MBR by default, while it seems GPT is needed).

5. Found some tutorials which mention Debian Mac 8.7.1 i386 iso. Unable to find that one anywhere (again, patience ran out, rage building up) so I took the recent release 12.8, but refused to start the install due to low memory.

6. Getting desperate, tried Bodhi 5.1 (legacy), but it remained on a terminal window with limited commands.

7. The (current) final act in this tragedy was then to go through my old stuff and take an old MacOS Snow Leopard install CD and just get something working on this overrated piece of garbage from 17 years ago. At least that should work, right? Stopped halfway to bitch about not enough ram, because the minimum is 1gb. You piece of overpriced silver trashcan, there is exactly 1gb on that motherboard!

Stopping myself from introducing a baseball bat to this piece of nightmare, I decided now would be a good time to have a smoke break, coffee break, and then head to the shop for some DDR2 ram.

Adventure, noise, constant motion-I was the friend who would drag you out on a Wednesday night because, hey, we only live once, right? But last year, something changed, and honestly, it took me by surprise. It all started with a stranger‚Äôs random advice on a Tuesday morning.

I was waiting for my coffee at a caf√©, scrolling aimlessly, mostly just trying to ignore the buzzing city sounds around me. I wasn‚Äôt exactly reading, just skimming through my phone, half-heartedly clicking on a link about liver transplant funding for a friend‚Äôs dad who‚Äôd found help from Transplant India*.* My mind was elsewhere when someone tapped me on the shoulder.

I looked up to see an older man, weathered but kind-looking, dressed in a worn jacket and holding a tea like he had nowhere in particular to be. He asked me, with that calm certainty that only comes with age, ‚ÄúHave you ever tried silence?‚Äù

My immediate thought was that he must be some kind of minimalist guru or meditation advocate. I forced a smile and said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more into noise.‚Äù He chuckled and shrugged as if he expected the response. But before I could politely nod him away, he looked me squarely in the eyes and said, ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs clearer when you turn down the volume.‚Äù

And just like that, he walked away.

For the rest of the day, his words echoed in my head. I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking about them, even when I tried. It was strange; I‚Äôm usually good at brushing off unsolicited advice, but this felt different-almost like a dare. Later that week, I caught myself researching silent retreats. Maybe it was the mundanity of my routine or maybe just curiosity, but a few days later, I found myself signing up for a month-long silent retreat in the Himalayas.

I arrived at the retreat centre feeling...unprepared. It was up in the mountains, breathtaking but intimidating. The air was thin, and the silence was almost tangible like it was daring me to turn back. Every participant had a small cabin, and mine had nothing but a mat, a little blanket, and a window that faced endless, mist-covered peaks.

The first few days were a nightmare. I hadn‚Äôt realised how loud my own thoughts could be. Without music, people, or even my phone to distract me, every nagging worry and insecure thought surfaced. I thought about home, about mistakes I‚Äôd made, about why on earth I thought this retreat was a good idea. I was ready to bail by day five.

But one morning, something changed. I woke up to a light snowfall, tiny flakes swirling past my window. It was quiet, so quiet that I could almost hear the snow settling. For the first time, I felt‚Ä¶still. I noticed that I wasn‚Äôt just looking at the view; I was seeing it. I started listening more-to the rustling of trees, the hum of the mountain, the simplicity of my breath.

Each day got a bit easier, and soon, I began enjoying the silence. I started hearing my own thoughts more clearly, sorting through things I‚Äôd been avoiding for years. Memories from my childhood floated up, some joyful, some painful. I thought about friendships, family, and even that friend‚Äôs dad who‚Äôd needed the transplant-how fragile life was, how I‚Äôd never actually paused to consider what all these connections meant to me.

By week three, I was a different person. I found myself laughing silently at old memories, forgiving people, and forgiving myself. I didn‚Äôt realise how much I needed this.

On the last day of the retreat, we were allowed to speak again, and I sat with a few fellow participants, all of us hesitant to break the silence we‚Äôd come to love. When I finally spoke, I told them about the stranger in the caf√© and how his advice had brought me there. We laughed and joked about going back to our noisy worlds, but there was a shared understanding between us-a quiet peace that I couldn‚Äôt have explained if I tried.

1gsl22l,https://www.reddit.com/r/RoverPetSitting/comments/1gsl22l/dumping_a_client/,Dumping a client,"I'm having some thoughts about breaking up with a client and wanted a bit of a sounding board. 

I have been sitting a particular dog for a couple months, usually every other week. When we first started boarding he was exceptionally well behaved, very good at communicating his needs and always up for a nap and a cuddle. 

More recently he has been staying at his grandparents some weeks and his behaviour has completely shifted. Whilst he used to be able to entertain himself, he now cries and whines for constant attention - even barking at me whilst I was working on my laptop yesterday. If I take a shower he will sit and cry outside the bathroom door. 

Where he only used to go out for toilet trips every few hours, he will now sit and whine at the front door every twenty minutes or so begging for a walk outside. He has access to an outside space at my property, which he doesn't seem particularly bothered about. I have found that he will no longer settle in bed and will whine, cry and occasionally howl if he knows people are still awake and he isn't in on the action. When he first started boarding he was crate trained and that was his safe space he went to if he was tired, or fed up of hearing the TV whilst he napped on me - so this is a huge change in behaviour. His owner has confirmed that he has been this needy with her as well. 

He also now begs for any food you have, to the point that he even climbed on top of my coffee table to try and get at a crumpet of mine yesterday and tried to nip something out of my hand. 

I'm not sure what has caused this but his change in behaviour has made him more work than he feels worth at the rates I currently charge. I feel guilt because there are times where I do enjoy sitting him, but it is becoming exhausting. He gets at least three walks a day, he gets play time and he has things in the flat for mental stimulation as well, so he receives a high level of care regardless but oh my lord is he making me question why I do this on the side. 

Is it best to try and train this behaviour out of him, or perhaps time to cut my losses?

Would you say, these shoes could get the job done ?

But to build on what I said - I haven't found any conventional brands that seem to produce what I am looking for. As far as I know wide shoes and wide versions of shoes (2e,4e) don't seem to have the same positive effect as shoes wide toe boxes. Is that correct in your observation ?

1gsl0sn,https://www.reddit.com/r/FreeCAD/comments/1gsl0sn/laneway_house_ridge_anchor_system/,Laneway House ridge anchor system,"Today I modeled a prototype of a permanent ridge anchor system for the Laneway House. Pretty smooth going, except for FreeCAD emptying out an entire model document again. This time without any crashes involved. It's one of my smaller models with not too many dependencies, so I this one should be good for some forensic analysis. And I also put aside the backup file that still had a good model in it. Which by the way was not edited after the backup, so this is very weird and unsettling badness. I now have Git set up so I can create more frequent backups without using enormous disk space. I think I'm going to improve my Git backup to unpack the zips so it can do diffs on the xml files. Could be interesting.

Anyway, ridge anchors. This turns out to be a big deal out there on the interwebs. Roofers love permanent ridge anchors, provided they don't break off and drop them fifteen feet to the ground.There are a lot of products out there on the market and I can guarantee that they all look flimsier than what I modeled here. There is a great site out there with a list of things that are often done wrong with ridge anchors, and it's a long list. I was gratified to see that my design avoided every one of the listed pitfalls, but I still got some great guidance about how I could make it stronger. That two-arm design with a tube for a pin is quite unique. What is more typical is, just one of my arms here, and nail that to a rafter. Yeah. Scares me too.

Well, this is going to cost some money because a structural engineer will need to sign off on it, and the custom fabrication will cost a bit too. So why don't I just order an existing product? Answer: because 2x4 trusses are especially difficult to attach these life-saving devices to. If you do it, it has to be engineered. So thanks FreeCAD, we did the engineering today, and now we just need the engineering stamp. Uh... good thing I can make nice engineering drawings for cheap. I will see if I can an initial engineering opinion for the price of a cup of coffee. My retired millwright friend thinks this design is great, and that's saying some. Industrial quality design input was provided. Again, thanks to FreeCAD for being able to produce these slick images that can be instantly understood.

Well, if you read this far then you're probably interested in some details. The round pin between the two arms is 22mm 304 stainless tube with rings of 25mm stainless tube welded (actually, silver soldered) to each end as retainers. The arms are bolted through the truss chords and through a 2x6 gusset with 6mm stainless machine screws. Stainless steel is used because it doesn't rust. Galvanized steel would also be good, except machining it leaves exposed steel that will rust. Aluminum is another alternative, except it would have to be two or three times larger to get the same strength. So stainless it is, and the cost isn't that much because there are only three of these, amounting to about six feet of 36x6mm bar stock. Not going to break the bank.

One essential detail I did not include in this image is, the steel gussets that hold the truss cords together. Every truss gets these at the peak (and other places) and the ridge anchor systems bolts right through them. Much of the strength will come from these nail plates, which will transfer the sideways torque to that large 2x6 spacer, which in turn transfers it to the truss cords. All the forces flowing in the directions in which the material is most strong.

Speaking of nailplates, I would be showing them in this image, except that FreeCAD took the liberty of throwing them away somewhere along the line. Just gone. Vanished. Took me a couple of days to model them too. However, I expect it will take much less time to restore them now that I have a couple months more experience.

There is a stainless tube running the length of the roof, at least the part of it that has cross-tied trusses (the  end room you can't see has an entirely different gambrel design, with ridge beam and cathedral ceiling). This tube is my answer to the question of, should you have a ridge beam or not? I decided not, because truss chords tied together with nailplates are way way stronger than rafters nailed to a ridge beam. for that reason it is now common practice to build with pre-fab trusses and no ridge beams. And it's cheaper...

Well, back to the stainless tube. It's there because I'm just uncomfortable about building with no ridge beam to tie the trusses together. Sure, it works, and the roof sheathing does tie everything together. But I felt better when I added that ridge tube to my design, and it will strengthen the ridge anchors. Chances are, I will remove it again at some point, but for now it's in there for discussion, and thanks to FreeCAD, the cost of doing that trial design is strictly minimal. I guess there's about ten minutes invested in that tube. More time spent writing about it, actually.

After meeting up for coffee, the next time i went to his place, after talking about what we want in sex & agreeing together, i told him that i wanted to try anal and wanted him to fuck me doggy (not my initial plan, but i wanted it bad).

He tongued my butthole, gave me lube and put his dick in slowly asking me if i was okay the whole time, which i said i was. Throughout i was purposely making some noises like heavy breathing but I'm not very loud and didn't say any words. His dick is 5.5inches and didn't hurt at all - went right in there, he could probably pound me as hard as he liked and it would have been okay. 

During sex he said my ass was amazing, i was taking it like a pro and so tight it's going to make him cum quick. Well, it was in fact QUICK-- like 60 seconds. And that he was holding back not to hurt me because i wasn't telling him to fuck me harder, he said he could go again in 10 minutes and can cum 5-7 times a day.

Later we cuddled on the couch and talked about different sexual interests, and things we don't like. I asked him how our sex had gone and let him know it was quick, he said it's  that's never normally that quick, doggy is what he does if he wants to cum fast and me arching my back and being tight was so hot he came. The only thing for me was to move my hips back towards him more (did not even realize i kept going forward!). 

It was my first time and i enjoyed the sensation. I wish his dick felt bigger and harder and more of a challenge, dare i say even a little painful. 

Maybe if i jerked off during it would have been more pleasurable and made me involuntarily moan loud? Am i doing something wrong?  Will other positions be more satisfying or if he just goes harder ? Shouldn't anal last between 5 minutes & 30+ ? Should i look for someone else with a bigger dick ? Should i ask him to come before i get there (i do want him to be rock hard still!). 

Round two with him tomorrow anyway and I told him i want to try riding him cowboy which he really wanted and missionary, he loves tongue kissing and the thought of him doing that while getting fucked will probably (hopefully) send me to mars.

That would be awesome!"" where I later said ""No I was just joking"".

She later asked about this girl I once brought to this social gathering and said she seemed like she was your girlfriend but she wasn't, always we started talking about a few things in life and we talked about something where I usually get V-VIP passes for, and she said ""Oh I would love to go there"".

1gsktbk,https://www.reddit.com/r/DragonAgeVeilguard/comments/1gsktbk/84_hours_18_minutes_40_seconds/,"84 Hours, 18 minutes 40 seconds","I have finally finished my first playthrough after 2 weeks. Probably would have finished earlier if A) my physical copy had actually installed on my X-Box and B) I wasn't trying to get everyone to level 10 bond. As such I now feel capable of giving my feedback on the game and actually engaging with all the community and giving my 2 cents as it were. Instead of just Googling specific thoughts

SO first off: I enjoyed the game. It was a really good use of my time and worth the time above I spent. There will be critiques with it as many of the dreads and misgivings I had going in were confirmed during play BUT I would not have continued playing if my experience was bad.

As such some pre-amble that may make my experience different to yours:

\-I played on X-Box. (The only PC i have is the laptop I'm writing this on that has less memory than my last 3 phones so please don't attack that). Additionally I have played ALL the games on X-box starting with me buying the Ultimate DAO edition in 2009/2010

\-I played a Rogue, Elf, Shadow Dragon who is Non-Binary and Romanced Taash. 

\-I am Non-Binary?Trans-fem and Bisexual IRL so DO feel like I can comment on this and how the game lays it out

\-I am also Australian so live in the opposite Timezone to (probably) most others on here so may take a bit to respond to any comments etc

**ONWARDS!! BEWARE SPOILERS ALL AHEAD!!!**



**THE WORLD STATE**

As many others I'm sure have pointed out, the lack of imported choices was heartbreaking before the game released. i spent LITERAL DAYS in the Keep both pre and post launch of Inquisition getting all my world states in line for all the various ways the world could and would change. Then the lack of Choices in the character creator also felt like a broken promise from the Devs, about both how The Keep would help from years ago and the words from the current team pre-launch about how our previous choices would matter.

\-Kieran is not mentioned even in passing, despite him existing in EVERY one of my World States. Yes he would be 16-20 by now but Morrigan would not abandon him or ignore him if her characterisation in DAI was anything to go off.

\-Where are Hawke or Stroud or the HOF? even if they were in Weisshaupts Dungeon that would at least be something but not even a partial mention or find? The HOF may have gone to their Calling yes but give me SOMETHING like the notes from DAI's war table. Why does Isabella not mention Hawke? Where is Fenris? Half the game is in Minrathous so surely we can get a cameo or a codex about him? Could Shale not have found Kal-Sharok? If a Qunari Warden existed once why does the Arishok need Sten to find out what the blight is in DAO? 

ALOT of these could have been handled in the ""MORE"" section of the Dialogue Wheel by giving us the option to ask questions that could affect the World State in the same way as the Mirror did for Gender Identity or the Choice options did. Don;t use those then you get the default world state. OR by just updating The Keep. This is meant to be a world that represents our decisions but it no longer feels that way.



**THE SCOPE**

I honestly feel that the main conflict of the game came too early in the world itself. I feel that this could have been the background story affected by like 3 or 4 more games with Solas acting as the SERIES main villain puppeteering or assisting the ""Lesser"" antagonists with each game focussing on a different country/land to build up himself rather than needing to go all over Northern Thedas. This was also an issue I had with DAI. I wanted to fully explore Tevinter or Rivain or Antiva or The Anderfels. but I feel like those chances have now been ripped away. Only Nevarra and Par Vollen feel like they aren't now destroyed as at the Conclusion of the game. A more Focused Narrative and landscape I feel would have been more a Boon to the series as a whole and would also have allowed an easier jump point for new fans. The world threatening 5th Blight from DAO was kinda needed to set up the world and give you some stakes. DA2's more focused story was a great change to make you care about the Characters actually in the World and to see that the world itself is different even in just the next country over, with its ending a great set-up to the next game. DAI then tried to go too large and now left us in this need to go EVEN BIGGER right???? But I Feel facing something smaller, like Ghil'anain only in say The Anderfels would have been a magnificent follow up to the Grey Warden threads from the previous 3 games Or even The Architect/other Magisters that unsealed the Blight. Maybe have Solas be hunting them for the power from their respective Archdemon's being slain, them now able to more clearly hear their Gods from the Fade?

Speaking of: How did the rest of The Elvenhan actually pass? I honestly Didn't realise they had until the codex ""Ghil'anains' Hand Written Note"" where she says that Andruil has died. I presume they passed with time/old age after their Archdemon died (which would also explain the weakening of the Fade over time) but having this explained or talked about would be nice (if it was and I somehow missed it a clip/link would be appreciated)

  
**THE COMPANIONS**

The companions were a main talking point from the Devs pre-release, and for the most part I feel these were delivered on. I do feel still really disconnected from them though. Not being able to have static conversations (walk up and press 'A' to talk) didn't help. Rook not saying ANYTHING on any of the notes that I found or the cook lists. Where is My bed? I can only meditate in my room not actually sleep! Rook, Taash and Companions mention us kissing on numerous occasions but the only time I remember us actually doing so is in the final scene. To somewhat/butcher a quote from Lou Wilson- ""I want my Kisses Dammit!"" I could do this in all the previous games and to have this taken away actually felt less like I was part of the team.

As was certain developments. I would love to have seen Taash and Mae have a convo about their Gender Identity, I mean I did have one about mine with Mae but getting to see or help with that would have made my connection feel deeper. Why did Taash and Emmerich have a fight? I hadn't even had them both in my Party together yet!? That scene was very weird to me for that, KI can actually understand Taash needing to label Emmerich. They are a Qunari, in Rivain. Struggling with being something aside from A or B is actually a whole part of their character as is their conflict from Rivain vs Qunari culture and the VASTLY different approach to magic, mages, death and Spirits they have. Throw in something as unknown as a Nevarran Necromancer to someone struggling with who they are and Labels themselves can cause a LOT of confusion to someone that early in their journey with that much contradicting culture around them with an Overbearing mother? Taash's reaction seem actually really in character for me. Healthy or helpful? No. but understandable to an extent? Yeah.

I also enjoyed the representation. A non binary healer like Flynn being open and honest about who they are and the things happening to them (becoming a Warden and the full healer etc) whilst presenting fairly androgynously. Then the (obvious) Scumbag that is Invenci using they/them pronouns (I only noticed this near the end of the game) and being Masc presenting. Bellara and Irellin's subtle nods to each other. Being able to be open about who I am with the NPC's (full disclosure that ALL of my Rook's WILL be Trans so yeah, deal with it) Neve and the Shadow Dragons being so open and loving to Taash. The Lord's of Fortune being so nonchalant about Tassh finding who they are. (this is gonna make my next playthrough interesting as a Mage that romances Neve) Though on the flipside not being able to call out obvious evil people like Ivenci and Illario kinda sucks, as does not being able to bring up Mythal or Anaris to Solas at all until NEVER or ENDGAME respectively



**THE COMBAT**

I HATED the new combat system. I HATE Momentum. I honestly thought the lessening of Abilities in DAI couldn't get worse but here we are. I rarely used skills/abilities because early in the game I simply did not have the Momentum to use them like I would Stamina for the other Games, I also only started using the Companion abilities later on in the game as I had to wait for them to Cooldown rather than just that one ability. I ended up using just 'X'/Light attacks all game as it was just the simplest thing to do. Even after getting more momentum I found at that point the abilities were mostly unneeded or didn't work as well due to levelling up my gear to make use of the light attacks. Most of my level ups were spent on passives to just increase my damage or defense. I NEVER switched out any of my abilities. I BARELY used the Lyrium Dagger abilities either fro pretty much the same reason. I get each Rune needs a Cooldown but why does the whole Dagger need one? Or why can't I level it up so it doesn't?

The new gear system also sucks in my opinion. At least for the most part. Let me build the special effects rather than having to find the specific upgrade I need. Why do none of the Companions Trinkets go higher than ""BLUE"" or don't get another effect when doing so? WHY IS EACH ENCHANMENT LOCKED TO ONLY 1 SPECIFIC ITEM OR COMPANIONS??? Runes and Enchantment (ENCHANTMENT!) did not need to be overhauled this much. Thinking back to DAO and its such small amount of Runes to get pre-awakening compared to the amount here is kinda mind boggling.

I Don't remember which Dev said that ""Combat in Veilguard is actually fun!' but whoever it was I completely disagree with. This combat was the LEAST fun I've had with Combat in a DA game.

  
**OTHER THOUGHTS**

\-Why Couldn't Treviso hire a new Peddler? Give Jacobus something to do or something

\-Why aren't ALL Merchants on the map with the Faction Merchants being specified by their symbol?

\-Why do I HAVE to have a bow? Let me fully focus on dual wielding please

\-All factions should have some form of Specialty in the Level up system. Being a Rogue Shadow Dragon that specialized as a Crow after letting Treviso die feels awkward AF

\-STOP Limiting Level ups!!! Being Overpowered is part of the fun! Even if I cannot unlock everything don't stop me from getting XP at any point. give me only passive that increase my defense or attack by 1% thats fine. just let me keep getting stuff.

\-More gifts should be available in the shops or even randomly at other merchants

\-Assan and Davrin should survive if reaching 'Turlum' as should Harding if becoming one with the Titans. Have them become an additional boss battle with Elgar'nan if you don't like with the ME3 companions you don't help becoming transformed by TIM

\-Let me go back to Kal-Sharok dammit! I skipped half the merchants cause I assumed you could :( AND on that note: How Did Valta become a ROCK? and one that Large??

\-Why isn't The Iron Bull in the middle of Tevinter Screwing Dorian's brains out? Surely they would both do it for the sheer joy of shoving that in the Imperium's face??



**CONCLUSION**  
All in all you can see I have some complaints and gripes with the game. It is far easier to mention the negatives and focus on them. But I spent 84 HOURS ON THIS GAME!!! I have ALL the Achievements! AND I""M ABOUT TO REPLAY IT! This is a great game. It has its faults, for sure, but this IS DRAGON AGE and I love Dragon Age. and I love this game.

Now If you'll excuse me (this is a text post so of course you can) I am off to join the Lords of Fortune and woo Neve. Screw you Lucanis!!! (Not your coffee though) ",5,1731754095.0,DragonAgeVeilguard,0,0.86,False

I've been trying to make espresso and moka pot coffee at work but never really tried experimenting with it, so I bought my own Bialetti Elettrika (I don't want to start messing around on the stove just yet), some coffee beans from a shop I know is good from friends (the guy there said the coffee I got is pretty balanced), and tried making coffee at home. For some reason, my coffee comes out acidic, even though I:

* boil my water and fill it up to the bottom of the valve
* grind my coffee not too fine (I am using a very cheap and small electric grinder though)
* stop the pot before it starts to sputter (and keep the sputtering to a minimum, it sputters a little bit at the very end)

I heard that sour taste comes from underextraction (and once the coffee becomes bitter it's overextracted and too fine), so I tried grinding finer. I got to the point where I grind as finely as my grinder can (which seems pretty fine) and it still tastes somewhat acidic. What am I doing wrong?",3,1731753856.0,mokapot,10,0.81,False

They had done a counselor meeting a month ago, but that was before shit went down in New Argos. The brothers weren‚Äôt in the city when the attack happened, but at camp, where everything was safe and sound. Something they were thankful for because they were way too rusty to brawl with bad guys.

Now, after the attack, they were struggling to come up with ideas for what to do. Until it hit them; they hadn‚Äôt done their seasonal cabin meeting. Normally these meetings weren‚Äôt too juicy, because let‚Äôs be honest, they didn‚Äôt always have something to discuss with Harry, but with the return of one of their half-siblings there were some things they could talk about. One thing led to another, and Austin and Jason announced the meeting at breakfast.

The brothers waited for Harry and Seth to join them in the cabin‚Äôs common room. There was a red velvet cake on the coffee table for Harry‚Äôs birthday - the twins had already given him a gift - and a ‚Äòwelcome back‚Äô-banner on the wall for Seth. Jason had almost vetoed the banner, but Austin had convinced him to still put it up. A cabin meeting wasn‚Äôt the right place to express petty teenage angst.¬†

We're often speaking about relationship stuff, how each other behaves in a relationship and so on. She's also often referring to me when she's talking about relationship stuff (hope you get the idea, because I don't really know how to describe that). So I feel like her intentions are towards a relationship.

But there is something that concerns and confuses me. And that is, that we haven't gotten much physically yet. I mean sure we're always doing the welcome and goodbye hugs, which are kinda intense too, but when there are chances to get closer she doesn't really do anything.  
For instance, we went to a coffee shop the other day, and we sat on the same bench, so we were kinda close. I tried to constantly move towards her but she didn't really respond. It was not like she's backing up, but more like she didn't even recognize it.

Yesterday was a different situation. She invited me over to hang out at her place. I hoped for a chance to get closer but she planned to sit on the table and just talk. I thought we haven't had any chance to actually touch each other, but I think she didn't even had the intentions to.

But as i said on the other hand she's constantly speaking about a relationship with me and i guess it is something that she thinks off. Also she wants to spend a lot of time with me and so we're seeing each other again today and a next date is already planned.

So now I don't know what to do. Should i still try to get closer, should I speak with her about that (without pushing ofc) or should i play it safe and just wait that her intentions are clearer?",1,1731753254.0,dating_advice,6,1.0,False

1gskkxm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1gskkxm,What am I missing out on if I‚Äôm only getting beans locally? (Tim Wendelboe + nexpect review),"This question has been floating on my mind for quite a while now. I‚Äôve been generally satisfied with Japanese roasters, especially if I will compare them with the roasters from my home country, but I guess fomo is still there.

So I was excited to try some Tim Wendelboe from nexpect coffee. I know TW is obsessed with Kenyan coffees so even if I knew Geisha would be better, I still got a Kenyan pourover. Plus, I am not satisfied with Kenyan coffees I‚Äôm having recently, so I was wondering whether TW's would be better.

As soon as I took a sip, I‚Äôm immediately reminded of Kenyan coffees from Fuglen early this year and Kurasu from last year, although TW's had just a bit more florality. Suffice to say, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm missing out that much. However, I think I‚Äôm starting to prefer lighter (nordic) coffees like these. And since most Japanese roasters roast a little bit darker, I may have to limit my purchase to a couple of roasters. 

As to the cafe itself, I like the idea of them showcasing nordic roasts, but the place strikes me as a little bit unwelcoming. The table is as small as it can be, and there was a note about laptops not being allowed to use. I understand that it's pretty common for specialty to prohibit using laptops, but personally I think it's better to just ask the customer to stay for a short time or to order again after an hour or so. In any case, the baristas themselves were pretty approachable. They chatted with everyone who stayed at the cafe.

I also got an espresso that they pulled using Brazilian beans from Fuglen. I would have wanted to get a TW, but they were not offering it that day. It was alright, not the best, as it seemed to be dialled in for milk drinks.

I've seen a post on a Facebook page from someone saying they had lost 35lbs and been on it for over a year.  Now I'm not saying that isn't a good weight loss but that's also a lot of money - thats just over half a pound a week.  Reducing calorie intake by just 250 per day - that can be a coffee and biscuit and increasing calories output by 250 per day - that's a 2/3 mile walk will result in a  pound a week. They must have spent getting on for ¬£2K, that's not good value for money in my opinion.  I could have taken their ¬£2K and given them meal and exercise plans and I'm sure they would have had better results",0,1731752451.0,Fibromyalgia,5,0.25,False

1gskfu9,https://www.reddit.com/r/diabetes/comments/1gskfu9/just_a_rant/,Just a rant,"(27f) So a few years ago I had COVID really bad. After that I started getting strange symptoms and ended up going to the DR to find out I was almost in DKA and he diagnosed me Type 2 Diabetic. Now mind you I‚Äôm 117 pounds soaking wet. In the years I‚Äôve been on many different medications, and I‚Äôve recently had a doctor take me off all because ‚Äúsomething else must be going on you‚Äôre too skinny for this‚Äù. Just to almost go in DKA again. Everything affects me; food (yes, even keto), stress, lack of sleep, exercise even gets it high for too long if it‚Äôs strength training, coffee, protein snacks. All of it. I‚Äôve been recently told I‚Äôm a mix of both types. Nobody I know has diabetes, and it‚Äôs frustrating to go through so alone. Every time I have a problem from it people assume because I have type 2 I just made poor life choices. Which isn‚Äôt the case, but why do I feel so guilty when I have to cancel something due to being so high even though I only ate 10 carbs max that day? While on medicine!! My college professor can‚Äôt stand me while I‚Äôm trying to get it back in range and am constantly sick, and I just feel so burnt out and tired from it already. And it‚Äôs only been 4 years, here‚Äôs to a lifetime I guess!

Any fellow stoned night owls up?

I'm 35 and a millennial with knees shot from going to so many shows (not really but god damn does it feel like it). I'm a huge horror fan (why I went to film school), I absolutely love everything about the paranormal and ghosts, I, like many mid 30 somethings, have a lot of tattoos, I consider myself alt/alternative whatever you wanna call it. I work in film/graphic design and have two degrees to show for it. I love hardcore and I love black metal, I still go to shows, I lean pretty damn left, I love tabletop rpgs, I love mini painting and 40k, I love pro wrestling, I am an avid PC gamer, I am hooked on caffeine and coffee. Fuck me up with a trip to the library or bookstore, I love reading and have been tearing through a series I've been looking forward to for a while now. I collect vinyl and I love cooking/staying fit.

If that seems up your alley then hit me up and let's see what kind of friendship we can form. I think it'd be cool.",0,1731752339.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False
