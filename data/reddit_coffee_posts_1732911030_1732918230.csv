Until now, things were pretty unremarkable. I came out, some family were supportive, others weren't, but no one yelled, called me slurs, or anything like that.

But now that I have been on HRT for 9 months, I wanted to see some progress.

So I texted my family and just asked them to stop deadnaming me. I didn't even ask them to use my new name - just keep it neutral if they're not comfortable. Thanksgiving was not bad, so I thought every thing was groovy.

Today, we had a ""work party"" to help put up a fence. I got nothing but deadnames and ""he/him"" from the second I arrived. And not followed by an oops. Just as if my text had meant nothing, or that the holiday was the only day people would respect my wishes. 

I walked off to cool down, pee, and get some coffee. At that point I was planning on going back out. But one of my aunts came storming in, calling me selfish, saying they're ""trying their best"" (which is bullshit), yelling that if I'm so sensitive I just shouldn't come around.

So I left. Then got an earful about how disrespectful that was.

Hi, everyone. I’m 20, and I’ve been in a relationship for over a year with my boyfriend. He’s caring, affectionate, and deeply loves me—he always tells me I’m the most beautiful girl he’s ever seen, compliments my body, and shows me so much attention. He’s the type of guy who would rush to me when I’m sick, pick me up after a stressful job, and constantly remind me how much I mean to him. From the outside, it seems like the perfect relationship, but on the inside, I feel like I’m suffocating.

The issue is his jealousy and need for control. He says things like, “It’s everything but the club,” implying that he’s only uncomfortable with me going to nightclubs. But in reality, it extends to so much more. For example, he gets upset if I want to go skiing or camping with my friends, even though these are things I’ve done since I was young. He also gets mad if I talk about visiting my cousin in another city or spending time with my friends back home. He often gives his “opinion,” but it’s not just an opinion—it’s more like an expectation for me to follow what he says.

I feel like I have to explain and justify everything I do, even small things. For instance, I was once with friends at a coffee shop until midnight, and he got upset, accusing me of lying about it being open. Another time, I accidentally opened WhatsApp while studying, and he questioned why I did it, even though it was nothing significant. These little things add up, and I constantly feel like I’m walking on eggshells, trying not to upset him.

On top of that, he gets upset about how I communicate with him. If I send him a sticker instead of a heart emoji, or if I say “I love” in one message and “you” in another, he gets mad. He tells me things like, “Don’t send stickers, they piss me off,” or, “Just say it in one phrase.” It’s hard to understand why these small things bother him so much, but they turn into fights that drain me emotionally.

What’s hardest for me is his control over my freedom. He needs to know everything—what I’m doing, where I’m going, with whom, and when I’ll be home. I’m studying for my exams right now, but I feel obligated to call or text him every few hours, even if I’m busy. I don’t want to, but I’m scared of him thinking I don’t love him or getting mad. It feels overwhelming because he doesn’t let me have space to breathe or focus on myself.

We’ve broken up four times, but every time, we end up getting back together. He always finds a way to come back into my life, and I let him because I feel weak and because he’s so persistent. He’s told me things like, “No one will ever love you as much as I do,” and it makes me doubt myself. What if he’s right? What if this is what love is supposed to look like? He also says, “I’ll find someone else who will respect me and do what I want,” but then he begs me to stay and admits he’s “new to relationships” and still learning. It’s so confusing and emotionally exhausting.

I trust him completely—I’d never stop him from going out or doing things with his friends because I believe in his character. But he doesn’t give me the same trust in return. I’ve compromised so much for this relationship. I stopped going to clubs, I adjusted how I dress to fit his preferences, and I don’t hang out with certain friends because I know it will upset him. But it feels like no matter what I do, it’s never enough. He always finds something to be mad about.

I want to live my life, go to festivals, travel, and create memories with my friends. But every time I mention these things, he gets upset and says it’s about protecting me, not controlling me. He says he’s not neutral and loves to travel, but he doesn’t let me do anything alone. I don’t know how to reconcile my love for him with my need for freedom.

Two days ago, while discussing this, he said, “When we break up, I’ll help you find a guy who likes to go clubbing with you.” He says these things jokingly, but it hurts because I’ve told him it’s not about clubs—it’s about feeling free and trusted. He’s even admitted, “I’m not made for relationships,” but then turns around and insists he is. It’s a cycle I feel stuck in, and I don’t know how to break free.

I’m scared of leaving him and regretting it later. He truly loves me, and I know it. He’s kind, thoughtful, and has all the qualities of a great partner. But at the same time, I feel suffocated, trapped, and like I’m losing myself in this relationship.

I lost last pregnancy in late October, I am just starting to feel physically normal again. I keep on drinking wine and overdoing it with coffee. I am not back to running (something I have enjoyed for years). All because I keep thinking “oh well I will be pregnant again soon and won’t be able to enjoy wine/coffee/food” and “oh well, what is the point of getting back into running and setting goals as I will be pregnant again soon and will be too fatigued”?

I had 2 MMCs and 4 chemicals in the course of 1 year.

Last pregnancy ended as MMC at 11 weeks, fetus stopped developing around 8w5d.

I would describe our relationship as absolutely perfect. he's the most chill guy, never jealous, when he's mad he keeps to himself, he never screams and it's really hard to get him angry. Absolutely loving and truly treats me well. there is just one little problem, that I'm starting to realize is not that little, he's a binge drinker. ive always known that he likes to drink, but remember we did long distance I didn't really actually think about how much it would affect our relationship. 

I would describe him as a high functioning alcoholic. everyday after work he drinks 3 tall cans, and Friday he buys a 12 or 18 pack and will drink them all if not most of them. to the point where is so obviously drunk. there is this certain look that he gets when he starts to get tipsy. I can't explain it but once he gets THAT look I know it's over. he drinks at every family party and I am starting to get really embarrassed by him I know people notice cause they will start staring and whispering to eachother. he's not a loud or violent drunk by any means he just talks a lot and starts having deep heartfelt conversations with everyone and anyone. 

on the weekends we like to get pajarete its raw milk with coffee and alcohol. its early in the morning. well this place also sells food and beer. on a good day we will have 2 pajaretes and leave. but on most days after his pajarete he moves on to beer and we end up stayed till he's more than tipsy, we get home and he just wants to sleep all day and there goes our whole weekend. he can go a few weeks without  drinking too too much and hell be productive around the house. things will be so perfect then he goes weeks drinking excessively and then sleeping a lot,

  
idk what to do, a part of me wants to stick it out hoping he'd change. he said after his 30th birthday he was going to slow down and that came and went, now he's saying the begginign of the year he will slow down. I truly love him and if it wasn't for his drinking I would say I'm living a fairytale with him. but ones he get THAT look I loose respect for him, he almost disgust me, I hate seeing him like that. 

my family loves him everyone does, he truly is a good guy. I hide from everyone that he's an alcoholic, but I'm sure they have their suspicions. I always make excuses for him to make him look good or excuse his drinking. I really am happy until he starts drinking.

You can’t change that, nor should you” “I simply can’t take it anymore. I think it’s selfish for others to think I should stay alive. It’s not your life. It’s mine” and when i pour my heart out to her, this is how she responds. but sometimes i’m fed up and tell her to not do this to me and it’s unfair and she will tell me to go f*ck myself and i don’t care about her. i know she does all of this for attention because she will do this to her parents and friends too. nothing anyone does will help her or make her feel better but if you’re not at her feet begging, stopping your whole life for her then she tells you to f*ck off and you don’t care. she went as far as posting on fb this last time saying “the su!c!de hotline is a joke and so are the people who say they care”, obviously i feel this is a way for her to get attention and sympathy from others who may be oblivious to her behavior as she does put up a good mask for people on fb and makes it seem like she doesn’t go on these episodes. my mom will get physically violent when she’s drunk when someone calls her out for her behavior and 4 years ago she wanted me to go find something for her in her house i never been to because she just moved and she started yelling at me so i stood up for myself and my sister got in between us and my mom slapped my sister in the face and i saw red. i blacked out in anger and my sister told me i got up from the couch and stood on the coffee table, grabbed my moms face and slammed her down on the ground and starting beating her face in. she got me off of her and my mom was so drunk she kept trying to fight me back. the next day my mom told me that she’s waiting for my apology but for what? anyways fast forward to today, she’s been living with my grandparents for almost a year now because she couldn’t live on her own anymore and she’s still doing the same things and not changing and i don’t think i can do it anymore. she will act like nothing is wrong a few days after she threatens her life and says horrible things and i can’t move on from it. it would be one thing if she apologized but she doesn’t even have the capability to understand the damage she’s done to my and my sisters mental health. she thinks everyone can just move on and pretend nothing has happened but i can’t anymore. i have a baby girl now and i can’t have my daughter around that kind of behavior and especially around someone who was drunk when i gave birth, at my baby shower, when i came home from the hospital and the 2 times i have seen her since. she will hide vodka or wine in water bottles and leave the room to drink them as as the visit goes on she gets worse and worse. i haven’t spoken to her in over a month (since her last blow up) and i don’t know if i should reach out and tell her how i feel or if she doesn’t even deserve that. this whole thing is so overwhelming for me and there is so much more to this story i can answer any questions y’all may have. and for reference i am 26f and my mom is 52f.

1h2wqhy,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h2wqhy/ex_m29_came_back_a_year_later_just_to_hurt_me/,"‘Ex’ (M29) came back a year later, just to hurt me (F28)again. How do I not lose hope that I’ll find love? ","I say ‘ex’ because we weren’t in a relationship. 

Last night, I got a text from someone I was seeing last year for about 5 months. I am female and 28, he is male and 29. 

For context:

We’d, stupidly, entered in to a casual relationship and things naturally got complicated. I caught quite strong feelings for this guy, but given our difference in religious beliefs, he was adamant that he wouldn’t allow himself to get close to me like that. It didn’t stop us from seeing each other every two or three days, again stupidly, and it meant that my feelings developed and got entangled with the intimacy we were sharing.

Last October, I went to abroad for 2 weeks and we agreed to use that 2 weeks to ‘separate’ and not talk. When I was back we wouldn’t see each other again. Except, I landed on vacation and he messaged me for the whole 2 weeks I was there. When I got back, we met up again the very same day. That day when we met up, I essentially asked him what this was. Was this ever going to go anywhere. He said he had feelings for me and cared for me but couldn’t see passed the religious differences. We were intimate, and Iay on his chest and almost begged him to not let a good thing go. I cried, he cried, he told me he’d miss me, that he wanted me to still message him etc. we parted ways.

A week later, I dropped a text when the dust settled to see how he was as that conversation had been really emotional for the two of us. His response was cold. ‘I’m happy with how things ended, we weren’t in a relationship so I don’t have anything to get over’. I felt sucker punched, but I left him alone. 

A few months later, in a moment of vulnerability, I reached out again and he blocked me. I’ve been blocked, as far as I know, since then. It’s been painful, I’ve really missed having someone there so readily, someone to talk to all day, to be intimate with, to share time with. It took me ages to dull that ache for him. Before him, I hadn’t gotten this close to a man in about 6 years. Being able to be in my feminine energy around him, for him to be responsive and communicate openly and daily with me, not ‘ghost’ - all the bare minimum, but it’s been so long since I’ve met someone who genuinely wants to give me their time, fully. 

Over the year, I poured my love in to myself. I trained at the gym, ate well, moved country and redesigned my whole life. I thought about him every single day, until about 3 weeks ago, when the thought of him didn’t niggle so much. 

Fast forward to last week. I noticed I was unblocked as he appeared on my suggested friends on instagram. I didn’t do anything about it, just left it. I started to feel like I was actually moving on from it. I didn’t feel inclined to reach out as he’d blocked me and he was the one who was adamant he couldn’t be with me. 

Last night, I woke up about 3am to a message he’d sent me. He’s in the UK so he’d sent it in the evening his time. He’d replied to a story I’d put out asking if any of my friends in London had a gym pass I could borrow for the 2 weeks I’m there, and he just replied ‘you can use mine’.

I hesitated, but against my better judgement I responded. I wanted to, I wanted to hear him say he’d made a mistake and he wanted to pursue me and nothing would stop us. Except he didn’t.

After tentatively responding and checking to see if he was drunk (he wasn’t), we got in to a very long conversation. He said he didn’t want to cause me upset or aggro or to antagonise me, he just wanted to check in on me. Turns out very soon after we separated, he found a girlfriend. An actual girlfriend, one he committed to. They’d broken up last month.

The gist of the conversation was that he didn’t miss me, he’d just thought of me from time to time and hoped that I was doing well as I ‘deserved’ it. That I was always kind to him and he felt guilty about that. He wanted to cheer me on from afar. He then asked several times, which I declined, to meet up for a drink or coffee to catch up as ‘old friends’.

As you can imagine, this has left me reeling.

In the silence after we went our separate ways,  I’d formed in my head that perhaps he had missed me, perhaps he’d come back and realise what we had developed. He himself had said to me he had feelings for me! Surely with time he’d see that it was worthy to fight for. 

Instead I now know that he moved on within weeks, in to a whole relationship. He’d committed to someone else, when he couldn’t to me. He’d been intimate and loving with someone else. Given this person everything I wanted. That he didn’t miss me, but instead I feel like he pitied me. That he was checking in as he was worried I hadn’t found my happiness, as he so put it.

I’ve spent a year almost mourning the loss of a man that is the closest I’ve been to a man in years, to now just be yanked back in to feeling like I wasn’t enough for him then, and I’m not enough for him now.

I feel sick to my stomach, anxious, and almost like my heart has broken again.

I don’t understand why he reached out just to ‘check’ on me and to make it clear that he doesn’t want what we had anymore. But I feel so much pain, rejection and this feeling that I’m just not worthy of a man’s full commitment to me. It’s like I’ve taken 10 steps back and I’m flailing under the weight that I’ll never be enough for ANY man, no matter how much love and time I  put in to myself to heal. 

Over the last year, I’ve had the tough love from friends. I don’t need that right now. I just need words of warmth and support - and I’d be so grateful for it too. ",0,1732916802.0,relationship_advice,0,0.5,False

We met at a party. I didn't expect to find anyone I felt like talking to there, but there she was. We talked for about an hour and a half. We exchanged texts after, and made plans to read together at a coffee shop. She asked this morning if we were still on, and I said yes. I even told her I took hours off work to make this happen. Then she abruptly says ""sorry, looks like we're not meeting."" And I'm confused, because she sent this before we were supposed to meet and provided no additional context. So I try calling her, but her mailbox isn't set up to receive messages. I text her letting her know I'm on my way, asking if I missed something or if something came up, and nothing. I wait for an hour, just because I already took the time off work, and still nothing. So I'm leaving and going home.

I know she may not have ghosted me. Maybe she'll text me saying that something came up. But this happens to me a lot. And for once, FOR ONCE, I thought I'd met someone nice in real life instead of a dating app. But maybe that doesn't get to happen for me. Maybe I'm just supposed to be left unread or ignored or perked around, because it's all a big joke. Or because I'm in line with some other dudes I didn't know existed. And it's disappointing, especially because my friends got excited on my behalf, and now I need to disappoint them all over again. Unless she texts me back or something...but that almost never happens. And even when it does, I often just get ghosted a second time. Fool me twice, I guess.

Seriously, I know life is awkward and scary and busy. But don't ghost people, and don't just abruptly cancel on a date without explanation (unless your date is a serial killer or something). And if you're not attracted to them anymore, at least do the bare minimum of telling them so they're not left wondering what they did wrong this time.

Look I respect everybody's right to enjoy the game, hell, I enjoy the game, but the dialogue between characters is just straight ass. Like I can agree to disagree about a lot of the game's aspects, but the dialogue is bland and quippy like a bad Disney-Marvel movie. With every other DA game the party banter is an absolute delight, but in Veilguard my wife and I just roll our eyes and cringe. Coffee is brought up in EVERY scene with Lucanis in it, Harding is sickeningly twee, and Taash is downright unlikable. This game feels like it was written by and for the ""pupper/doggo 'but first, coffee' minion Facebook meme"" crowd. I can't believe how much I dislike these characters, it honestly hurts my feelings. 

I'm queer, and I love the gameplay, so I'm not an anti-woke shithead hardcore hater, but you're kidding yourself if you think the companions are at all comparable to previous games. I'm almost finished with the game and it just doesn't get any better, it certainly doesn't feel like a Dragon Age game. I miss when the romances made me FEEL something, but these characters are such cardboard cutouts compared to the rest of the series. Bellara is such a downgrade compared to Merrill, a similar character that is likeable because she has the contrasting characteristics of being sweet and innocent while also dabbling with blood magic. Bellara is just... Idk, adorkable? That's all the depth she really has. 

I haven't finished the game, so I can't speak on the main storyline (maybe it'll all wrap up in the end in a way that will blow my mind, hopefully) but I've just come to expect so much more. 

Dragon Age is my favorite series and has been since I was 14, but man this edition really suffers from the loss of the original writing team. The overhate does suck, but I think it's important to make it known that we can tell the difference and we don't like it. Veilguard could be easily palette swapped and made it's own game with no relationship to DA, and I would have enjoyed it so much more, but standing in the shadow of the series' history makes it look like a puddle of dog sick, writing wise.

I do this daily at work but at home I kept pushing off a second UDM Pro SE because other things needed me to pay for them. I figured ""well I have my old gateway and controller and switch so if I need to I can jump those in"". Well, I never added in my hardware straight failing when my daughter was with me...

430am my wifi monitor goes off and I figured we lost internet, switched it to direct connection and rolled over. Woke up at 730 to see that Internet was still down but then I noticed I didn't see any of my SSIDs, ran to my rack and my UDM Pro SE is just straight up offline. Not 10 second later my daughter wakes up so I go and get her and try to troubleshoot while holding a 3yr old, it's not ideal. Get her some milk, pop my phone to the hotspot, hand her a tablet and start to rip my boxes out of my closet to get my old Gateway, Controller, and switch. After 10min or so those are plugged in but things are still screwed up and every time I join the wifi, she loses Internet because the hotspot sends the wifi connection not the mobile network, mind you I didn't have coffee.

Finally get my controller online and jump on to see the port layout, move everything around I need to and the WiFi and home security system are online and on the net, that's really all I need right now.

Come downstairs and get some coffee, get on the unifi store and immediately buy a second one. Jumped on a support ticket and, since I have Unifi care, had my approval of my replacement SE ready to ship in a couple hours.

Point of the story... When you buy one of these for home, just assume you need 2. I've never had Unifi hardware fail on me before so this was shocking, especially since it's barely a year old. It's stressful as hell when you have a toddler wanting cereal, milk, and morning TV.

1h2wgw8,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosleep/comments/1h2wgw8/my_crow_speaks_to_the_damned/,My Crow Speaks To The Damned,"Black roses fell slowly upon the tiny casket. The weeping and sobbing was so repetitive that it became the sound of the world. I could not hear the world anymore. My own tears blinded me. Then the mewing of the cat outside my window dissipated the vision and I could breathe. I gasped for air, released from the grip of horror.

""What will you have me do?"" I begged. She blinked and licked the back of her paw, serenely staring at my crow. She was a dappled black with red highlights along her tail and a white patch atop her head. I had to obey the message of this creature or my child would die. Only their enchantment preserved her life. Only my obedience preserved the enchantment.

She meowed at me over and over, speaking Felidaen. I couldn't understand her. I began to feel a dull panic as I recalled this was going to be a problem, always. I looked at Cory when the messenger had given her instructions to me.

""You must agree to the next three things asked of you by other humans, no matter what."" Cory sounded puzzled by this, as he translated. The cat looked again at my crow and I felt fear that she would try to harm him. What could I do, if she did? Instead she vanished in the blink of my eyes.

""But how will they know what I have done?"" I grimaced.

""My Lord, I do not know. This is not what I expected from the cats. They are not interested in human affairs to this extent. It seems like a game, as though they are toying with you."" Cory considered.

""They have asked for nothing until now. I don't understand."" I complained. The shower in our cheap motel room stopped and a cockroach scurried out from under the door of the bathroom. A moment later, Detective Winters walked out of the bathroom in a fog of cooling vapor. My right hand ached, as though a mist were present.

""Who are you talking to?"" He asked strangely.

""I made a bargain with the Prince of Cats to save Persephone."" I answered him. ""I must do their bidding, or she will not breathe. They came here and showed me her death while I suffocated. Then they made a strange command, it is almost like a joke.""

""You trusted cats?"" Detective Winters sounded like me, mocking my voice, as though he were asking introspectively.

Cory flapped and made grinding noises, like shifting gears, and then clicked rapidly before he turned on me and repeated Detective Winters's joke. Then he laughed even harder. When my bird had recovered from the hilarity he had discovered, he said with delight to me:

""Don't you get it? It is funny because only a fool would trust cats."" Cory explained and then chuckled some more at my expense.

""My daughter would die otherwise."" I said somberly.

""Death will always happen."" Cory clicked to me. This was also funny to him, but he could see I was not even slightly amused and he stifled his laughter.

""What is it that you must do?"" Detective Winters dropped his towel while I watched so that I had to look away from seeing him naked. Lately he had done this, where he would dress and undress in front of me. I wasn't liking it.

""I must obey the next three things I am asked to do."" I told him. Detective Winters looked at me strangely.

""That is easy. I could ask you to do three different things right now and we can get on with our day.""

""No."" Cory clicked twice, the universal binary for a negative response. Then in plain English, my crow elaborated the rules for us: ""These must be things asked of him from those who desire something from him that he would not normally agree to. There is no magic in asking my Lord to hand you three different objects from around the room. That wouldn't count.""

""Jesus."" Detective Winters hissed. ""And this is just the beginning?""

""A mere test."" Cory agreed.

Detective Winters looked directly at me and asked me: ""Please confess to *what you did*.""

""*It was me*."" I stated, trembling and sweating instantly. 

""You are under arrest for *that*."" Detective Winters was buttoning up his shirt and nodded. He took a pair of handcuffs out of a leather holder on his belt and handed them to me. ""You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say now can and will be used against you. Do you understand your rights?""

I nodded and put on the handcuffs. I felt a tear in my eye. We were supposed to go to Mrs. Winters's house today and I would see Persephone and Isidore. Would I ever see them again?

""I'm sorry."" I pled, crying weakly.

""Does it count?"" Detective Winters asked Cory, using a tone and cadence that I did when I asked things of my crow.

""What do you think?"" Cory tilted his head and studied me carefully. ""My Lord's heart is breaking. His eyes say it hurts to obey your request.""

""Alright. I think I know how this works. I've got one more for you."" Detective Winters had a weird, creepy smile as he said this. I shuddered and realized again that I had no idea who this man was or what he was capable of. So much about the detective was a mystery. The more time I spent with him the less I understood him and the more he understood me, and my crow. I was completely terrified of him and the unknown retributions he could inflict upon me. And I was at his mercy like never before.

""Let's go."" He got his keys and his phone and helped me up by grabbing the chain on the handcuffs. Cory alighted upon my shoulder and we went with Detective Winters to his car and were seated in the back, where we always rode.

""Are you taking me to jail?"" I asked meekly.

""No, Lord. I already knew *what you did*. I don't know why...but I think you had a good reason. You were worried about his family, that's how I caught you. You have remained my prisoner since that day. It would be a waste to put you into the system. Look at all you have accomplished by my side, and think of how useful you have become. You wanted to be helpful, remember?""

""I remember."" I sobbed in relief and some other emotions I can't identify. Detective Winters didn't hate me, he had kept me. He had made me useful, giving me a chance to right the wrong I had done.

""Take those off and give them back, those are my handcuffs, you can't keep them."" Detective Winters reached back and handed me the key to his handcuffs. I twisted my hands around and unlocked my left wrist. Then I took off the other. We stopped at a red light and I gave him back his cuffs and key and he put them away in their leather pouch.

He took us through a McDonald's drive through and got us breakfast and lunch as they switched over. This particular Micky D's stopped serving at eleven and those who arrived at eleven could get the last breakfast items and then order cheeseburgers. Detective Winters really got off on eating both meals at once in their parking lot. They always had some egg McMuffins and breakfast burritos for him, as he showed up almost every day. He sipped his coffee slowly and said again for the hundredth time:

""I like McDonald's coffee better than Starbuck's."" Detective Winters swished some in his mouth like a wine connoisseur, enjoying the bitter blackness as a savor.

""I like McDonald's fries better then sunflower seeds."" Cory decided. I saw something in my crow's eyes as he glanced upon mine. The black orbs of his eyes were like a window into the world of death, and shown my own death.

I saw myself hanging from a rope in the cool morning of an old field with just one blue tree with white leaves. As I stared at this image the sun began to rise behind me and I saw my own soul escaping my body. I could hear the rope squeaking and the branch creaking. A mandrake blossomed beneath my mortal coil. The smell of death drew flies to the lips and eyes. The sound of a hundred crows coming to land in the branches was like the applause of an audience, as their wings beat the air.

""You alright, Lord? You look like you just saw a ghost."" Detective Winters watched me in the rear view mirror.

""I saw my own death. I looked into Cory's eyes and I saw how I will die."" I spoke absently, unable to remain reticent as I felt a fatal knowledge usurp my mind.

""Do not all men seek to know their death?"" Cory wondered.

""No, we ignore our death."" Detective Winters explained with sympathy in his voice. ""We are not supposed to know, we are supposed to think we will not die.""

""But, death will always happen."" Cory was baffled by this and fell silent. He couldn't understand that humans ignore death. It made no sense to him.

""Let's focus on life. That's enough about death for one day, right Lord?"" Detective Winters had taken my hand, by the tone of voice and words he chose. He was sticking up for me and suddenly the death scene seemed very far away. I doubted I had long, but with a man like Detective Winters comforting me I felt the world would be okay without me. Somehow I was able to put it from my thoughts.

Detective Winters got on his phone and said:

""It's me: Jack. I was wondering how you are doing?"" Detective Winters asked very sweetly. He was listening to someone describe how they were doing for a minute before he responded with: ""A sabbatical is probably fine, but I thought you were going to take two years off anyway. I think you should still do that.""

Someone was speaking to him and deciding something before Detective Winters said finally: ""I have someone who can help with that. I can bring him to you right now, if the time is right."" and then he chuckled and said: ""Okay, perfect. I will drop him off and get started on that.""

He looked at me as he hung up, giving me the creepy and weird smile he had earlier, except now he was leering at me with it. I shuddered, anticipating that this would be worse than the arrest. I could only dread the deed he had in mind, not knowing what it was.

The car stopped in front of an apartment building and I saw who he had brought me to. Dr. Leidenfrost was standing there in a black dress waiting with a charming blow pop in her mouth. I took note that she was not smoking and so did Detective Winters. He looked at me again and said in a very playful and teasing voice: ""Looks like Heidi has quit smoking. She'd have one now if she hadn't. Wonder why?""

""I am starting to guess. I don't want to be here. I want to go see Persephone and Isidore."" I complained. He got out and opened my car door like a chauffeur. Heidi smiled warmly at me as I forced my feet towards her. I had found her attractive before, but somehow I found her to be irresistible. I was gripped with terror, I did not want to be left alone with her. Detective Winters drove away, leaving me alone with her.

""Mr. Briar?"" She recognized me and knew my full name already.

""Dr. Leidenfrost."" I acknowledged her. She frowned slightly at the formalities we were using and the eight feet between us in the parking lot. I was quite comfortable with the distance and use of last names. My comfort was shattered as she came to me and hugged me and said:

""Call me Heidi, Lord. I keep dreaming of you, of this.""

""Of what?"" I asked stupidly.

""Of you coming to me, being with me. I've wanted you since we met. I see you, see who you truly are. You don't look away from me at all. I can hardly stand your gaze, but I can stand it even less when your memory fades."" Dr. Leidenfrost spoke gently and sincerely to me, hiding nothing of herself. That she was in love with me, I had no doubt, after she spoke thusly. ""Please be with me, please give me the life I want.""

""Okay."" I agreed, noticing a very large black cat sitting under the shade of an abandoned vehicle sitting in the grass. Its green eyes glowed in the darkness, watching as it listened and observed my obedience. I went with her to her home.

Detective Winters did not come back until much later. By then, Dr. Leidenfrost had fallen asleep in my arms. Her phone chimed that I could finally leave. It was a call from Detective Winters. I hoped she was done with me, I didn't want to come back and do this again. She was very beautiful and intelligent and her passion matched mine precisely. That her and I would make an excellent couple, I had no doubt. Perhaps that is what frightened me the most. I could not love her and my family with Isidore.

As I thought of Isidore I realized I had betrayed her. I had cheated on her. I might have to do it again, if the first time didn't do it. The shame and horror I felt made me glare at myself as I passed a mirror in her home. I found my clothes where she had scattered them as we had undressed each other.

Every moment I had spent with her was too good. Isidore was not like her at all, I had no desire for Isidore like I did for Dr. Leidenfrost. I had hardly ever kissed Isidore and I had already kissed Dr. Leidenfrost so many times. And not just on her lips. It occurred to me that I had not had any restraint. I could have done it quickly and barely touched her. Instead I had gone all-out and done everything with her, making it last for hours. I was confused as to why I had done this, like I was infatuated with her secretly and had wanted it as badly as she had. Somehow, without knowing myself for this man I was, when I was in bed with Dr. Leidenfrost. I felt sick in my soul and in my heart, torn between the family I had sworn and fought for, and this woman I had such lust for.

Outside it had become late afternoon. Detective Winters said nothing as I got into the car. I looked over at Cory. ""What?"" I demanded irritated by the silence.

""You smell different."" Cory said plainly.

""He smells like sex."" Detective Winters muttered absently.

""No talking."" I groaned. We went back to the motel first so that I could shower. Then we went to see Isidore.

I was to stay the night and be retrieved by Detective Winters in the morning. I spent a lot of time holding the baby and changing diapers and feeding my daughter. It was the only time I got to, so I insisted on doing everything. When Persephone was asleep we went out onto the sand as the water lapped at the rocks that were uncovered below.

I watched the moon. I wondered what horrors awaited me, if the silent white moon was a place of nightmares and death. Would I find peace, with so many contentions?

""What is it?"" Isidore looked up at me, so cute and delicately.

""I must tell you something I have done."" I told her.

""Will it hurt?"" She asked.

""I am afraid so."" I admitted.

""Then don't. Don't tell me. You didn't let me speak. Now it's my turn. Don't tell me."" She commanded.

I choked. I couldn't not tell her, if I kept it from her the betrayal would be complete. I was sweating, resisting the urge to confess what I had done, to beg for her forgiveness. I opened my mouth, about to describe my sin when she asked me, and I realized I had to obey her, or else:

""Please don't confess to me, Lord. I don't wish to know."" As if she already knew, somehow.

I started crying. It was very painful to keep it from her. I felt weak, unable to reconcile with myself unless I shared it with her. I realized that I had done the bidding of the cats and the last daylight faded from the sky.

""I only want your kiss, the one you saved for me, the real one."" Isidore's eyes were watering in her own kind of pain. She closed her eyes and tears raced from them down her cheeks as she leaned for it and whispered: ""Kiss me.""

1h2wcym,https://www.reddit.com/r/JUSTNOMIL/comments/1h2wcym/i_need_advice_its_been_years/,I need advice. It’s been years,"A long post with years of resentment building up… 

I met my MIL when I was a teen, I was friends with my now DH. I had a good relationship with her, we hung out some weekends and I would talk with her when I felt like I couldn’t talk with my own mom. (I realize now DH and MIL have a somewhat enmeshed relationship. Her marriage to his dad was not good.)

Around the time me and DH started looking for our own place to live, MIL was asked to move out of her place. She suggested we all move in together (DH, myself, MIL, and SIL) I told DH no because I didn’t want to move from my parents house to live with one of his parents. She pushed this for a few months, then when DH and I moved into our place I felt the relationship with my MIL shift. 

When we moved in together she started making comments to me when DH wasn’t around. Comments like “he doesn’t talk to me anymore because you’re around”, she also brought a bag of mouldy oranges to our house and said to me “*these* are for *my son*. You can have some to if you’d like I guess”. I started doing my own nails during covid, she asked to see them and when I showed them to her she said “HA! Wow, nice.”  I told my DH about the other comments she made throughout the years, “I wish you’d give me a key to your place.” and “how are *my* kitties?” talking about our cats, but he always just says “she’s so weird” so I just let them go. 

At this time she was out of her own place and living with a friend but she would invite herself over under false pretences. She texted my DH that we could have her old patio stuff, she would drop it off with her bf one night. Well they showed up without any notice one evening when I was working, let themselves into our apartment and went through my kitchen making a huge mess of dishes and takeout garbage. DH was in the back room and came over after hearing the noise. The three of them had dinner together then MIL and her bf sat on our couch for hours!! Like they were on a date, ignoring my DH in his own home. I came home late to them still sitting there. Her bf had worn his muddy shoes all through my house and on my white area rug. They left shortly after I got home because I was not very friendly towards them. But my DH didn’t say a word to her about how this was not cool. 

Things got a lot worse when I found out MILs boyfriend is still living with and possibly still dating his “ex” gf. (MIL and bf have been dating for 5 years- she’s never been to his house.) I followed their social media’s for about 3 months before finally telling MIL (bfs gf posted a Valentine’s Day post to him). DH agreed we should show her. Anyway, somehow instead of her being upset with her bf they turned it around on me- I’m ruining the family, creating unnecessary conflict, and she cried to DH that she doesn’t like the way I talk to her, again DH just says “she’s so weird.” I hadn’t seen the bf for about two years, (until DHs birthday), and since this happened she has started planning and hosting holiday gatherings on days I have to work (she texted the thanksgiving after this and asked for our availability, when DH told her we could both come the day she was planning dinner she said “actually let’s wait for a day that works for everyone” then planned and hosted on a day I was working), and only inviting my DH for coffee some weekends. He hasn’t said anything to her about excluding me. 

Fast forward to me and DH getting engaged. When we announced our engagement to her, one of the first things out of her mouth was “is your dad going to be there?!” My DH said “I hope so because he’s my dad.” When she received her invitation she asked us if her bf was able to come along. Me and DH had already talked about it and the answer was no. I was counting on him to tell her this but when she asked he looked at me and said “well I don’t know, what do you think?” I stayed silent until we left and asked him why he didn’t say no. He said he felt pity for her in the moment but he did text her the next day saying we’re not comfortable with that. She also said to me privately months later “if you seat me at the same table as FIL I will throw a drink in his face!” She had a bunch of other comments for me when DH wasn’t around like what we should be doing, “well me and FIL did this and that. You should do that.” I told him everything she said to me leading up to the wedding with no resolution. 

Our wedding was nice and small. I did my best to avoid her that day. Since the wedding I have been keeping low contact and trying to avoid her but I believe she’s started to catch on.

Me, DH, and SIL were together at our favourite hangout when MIL came in to pick up SIL. She looks right at me and says “what? He can’t come out to say hi to me?!” I said I guess not. But DH didn’t even know MIL was there yet. 

She posted a happy birthday to me online then deleted it within hours. At DHs birthday at a pub she came in with her bf and SIL. She started singing happy birthday to him then said “do you notice how it’s only your mommy singing to you?” Making me feel like she was competing with me because I didn’t doing anything for DHs birthday publicly. She sat at a separate table, keeping DH with her while I sat with SIL and another friend. My anxiety skyrocketed. I felt like I was going to throw up being in the same room with her because I didn’t know if she would say something to me. (This reminds me- one year she had my car while we were on vacation. On her way to pick us up from the airport (our flight got back the same day as DHs birthday) she told DH there wasn’t much gas in it (the tank was full when she dropped is off so she drove my car around all week, emptying the gas tank) so he asked her to “put like $30 in” so she did. She then hands him a birthday card with $50 in it and the receipt for the $30 of gas she put in).

Weeks later we were all out together again. We dropped SIL off at MILs house. I stayed in the car because I just don’t want to be around her, I never know she she’ll say to me. MIL came outside, talked to DH a little and then saw me in the car. She opened the drivers door, leaned over the seat, and took the keys out of the car. She handed them to DH saying “I don’t want to listen to that.” (meaning the dinging from the door being open) she then leaned into the car again and got inches from my face just to say “hiii”. 

I have cried to DH about how she makes me feel. I even told him that MIL told me her own mother would say mean/rude comments to her when her father was not around but her mom was so kind to her when he was around. She cut contact with her own parents for this reason and a few others. 

He recently said to me “I don’t know what her problem is. I know I have to talk to her but I don’t want to have an uncomfortable conversation.” I thought why is it ok for me to be put in this uncomfortable position for years but you can’t have one conversation?

He is going to be visiting her soon while I have to work and I am ruminating in the comments she has made to me, wondering what she’ll say to him when I’m not around, and how he’ll respond to them. I do feel some resentment towards my DH because he will not say anything to her. 

So I’m looking for advice with my DH. How do I get him to stand up for me? I’m not asking him to go no contact with his mom but I need him to call her out when it’s necessary.

1h2wbze,https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1h2wbze/update_on_egotistical_coworker_rant/,UPDATE on egotistical coworker rant!,"3 months ago, I wrote this [post ](https://www.reddit.com/r/gaybros/comments/1f3kx0w/im_sick_tired_of_my_egotistical_coworker_a_rant/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)explaining why I was ranting about him in the first place. I just wanted to give an update as to what happened after that.

He got fired (or quit) after I sent a lengthy email to the general manager and supervisor entailing all of what I've experienced from him AND after he got into it with one of my coworkers. 

Here's more of what he did:

* There was coffee creamer on the floor and he soaked it up with napkins. Okay, fine, but he used a towel from the sanitizer bucket and wiped it up. 
* He somehow managed to spread bed bugs everywhere and talked about it **in front of the customers.**
* He kept antagonizing me even when I wouldn't give him a response. I didn't have any respect for him. Why should I bother talking to you like we're friends if I there's no respect from me to you? Sure, I'll talk to you about work stuff, but that's it. After so many times of him saying good morning to me and me not responding, he finally asked me if I enjoyed being miserable. Apparently, me not responding was confirmation that I do indeed enjoy being miserable. 

NEWSFLASH: I'm not miserable. I just don't like you. 

Grey rock the fuck out of a narcissist, and they'll eventually stop. Hopefully, that is. 

He's also a born again Christian. The reason why he would waste company time was talking to the customers about seeking God and letting Jesus come into you. Apparently that was his calling. I'll try to be understanding if that's your calling, but you're doing this at a restaurant. 

So, like, stop maybe.

He called my coworker a bum ass bitch because she's 40 and lives with her mother. She called him a fake ass Christian and that pissed him off so much that he got in her face. He lied saying that he didn't do that even though 1. there's cameras and 2. there's me and another coworker who saw the whole thing happen.

1h2w74b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1h2w74b/fought_with_my_husband_31m_on_my_30f_birthday/,Fought with my husband 31M on my 30F birthday. Long post but please I am desperate for help. Where do I go from here? ,"Hey guys, I just turned 30 this past Tuesday. For context, it’s been a really busy month for the both of us. I just started my new job in healthcare and there’s a huge learning curve, I’m supposed to be working 8hr shifts at the hospital 5x/week but recently it’s been much longer than that. My husband and I also just moved out of my parents house and into our own apartment 2 weeks ago. 

My sweet, sweet husband has been unpacking 
everything and setting up our entire apartment. I can honestly say he has done 95% of the work and I’ve done maybe 5%. Everything is literally up - our beds, bookshelves, coffee table, even the TV mount have all been assembled thanks to him.

He asked me about a month ago what I wanted to do for my birthday, I had no idea and told him we can figure it out later. Last week I started crying bc I kind of felt like he was really focused on the furniture shopping, I got worried that we’d just do furniture shopping for my birthday. He comforted me and told me “ofc we’re not furniture shopping on your birthday silly, I’ve  been planning this for months. I know you like surprises so I didn’t tell you.”

So Tuesday comes along, my husband had taken off from work for all of thanksgiving week but we had no plans other than thanksgiving at his 
sister’s on Thursday, bday dinner with my parents and siblings at some point this weekend, and going to a really pretty garden that he and I go to every year as a yearly tradition. He threw out some ideas about maybe seeing a movie together on Tuesday or going out for dinner, I said that sounds great and I would try to get out early at 3:30 like I’m supposed to but if it gets busy I might not be able to. It didn’t seem like there was anything specific planned including the movie that day so I just didn’t think too much about setting the boundary at work that I needed to leave on time that day. And unfortunately instead of getting out at 3:30pm I got out at 6pm. I got home and my lovely husband had gotten me delicious food and even went to two different places to get it, and he got me wonderful gifts too. And he brought a shitload of my stuff from my parents house that I’ve been wanting to put up here. And that was pretty much it. I noticed he didn’t get me a birthday card this year, he always does for our anniversary, Valentine’s Day, and birthday and it always has a heartfelt message. I was a little sad about that but didn’t say anything about it. 

Well fast forward to Thursday before we leave for thanksgiving dinner my husband asked when we can go furniture shopping, I said between having dinner with my family and going to the garden it’s really just Sunday, and he said he didn’t love the idea of waiting til Sunday but sure. And then he asked more about furniture shopping and if we can do it online in between all my birthday celebrations, I said sure but I just wanted to make sure we did have time to celebrate my bday.

He could sense my disappointment, we talked, I told him I really appreciated and loved what we did for my birthday but I guess I just wanted…to do something more? Something bigger? I was really looking forward to my 30th. I guess I just didn’t expect Tuesday to be a one and done sort of thing for my bday when it came to just the two of us celebrating. I was hoping to go out and do something together, maybe a dinner or something after we went to the garden. But even then I guess I just felt like my husband was focused on furniture shopping to set up our home and I was worried the garden wouldn’t happen. Anyway, I wish I was better at articulating at the time bc the convo escalated and we started getting upset and yelling at each other. He said I had not given him any ideas or told him what I wanted to do for my bday and he’s not a mind reader so I can’t be upset since I didn’t tell him.

I guess he was just always good at surprises and it was a lapse in my judgment to not communicate what I wanted. For past bdays he took me to the aquarium to pet a beluga whale, took me to a wonderful art exhibit, last year was chill and we just had a thanksgiving dinner with both our parents. I guess I just thought this year would be different. For his 30th birthday I took him to a really nice bed and breakfast in a small town and got him presents, 3 birthday cards, and later I arranged a get together with all his friends at a  nerdy brewery and got him a cool Harry Potter themed cake.

So I ruined thanksgiving dinner and something he was really looking forward to. We ended up going but we were so late and we just went to appease our parents. We didn’t even go earlier like he wanted to bc I took too long cook and get ready, I crossed respecting his time boundary which is something we have talked about in the past. I crossed the boundary of telling my parents which is also something we discussed in the past

I heard him talking to his therapist this morning (I know…another boundary crossed). I think I broke my husband. He sounded absolutely heartbroken and crushed. I have never heard him sound like this. So low. Last night he was so depressed and apologized saying “I messed up your birthday I’m sorry.” …Here he is trying to set up our home for the two of us, he was prioritizing me by basically trying to set up our home comfortably for our new life together, and I basically spit back in his face saying it’s not good enough. He told his therapist he feels so hopeless and at an extremely low point in our marriage and doesn’t feel like any of his efforts are recognized or that whatever he does for me isn’t good enough. We’ve had problems in the past and we attributed it to us living with my parents or his parents, now that we’re on our own we still have problems. The therapist said it sounds like no matter what he does I am never happy and even if he was the perfect husband I still wouldn’t be happy….I didn’t know I was like that but now I can see it. And I think I am the problem. I get so hypersensitive to his tone of voice or the things he says and I read too much into it and make assumptions and I cry and cry and that makes him feel terrible about himself and it hurts the both of us. The therapist said he needs to prioritize himself when he’s feeling low like this and do some self care, even if it means cancelling plans with me. I hated to admit it but it’s true.

We just got married last year. I thought our first year of marriage would be happy. Right now idk if our past year has been happy, I’m feeling really low right now and all I can think of is all the low points and arguments and fights we’ve had. Before we moved to our apartment we got into an argument bc I was on my period, had a rough day, and then read too much into his tone thinking he was mad at me and ended up having an argument with him where he kicked me out of his car bc he felt like he couldn’t breathe and needed space. Basically when I posted about that on here everyone said that was not cool and it’s valid that I asked my parents for a ride and got them involved. When my husband and I are great we are great, when we are not we are both extremely reactive and hurt each other with words and actions. 

I’m so scared you guys…I feel like a horrible person who just self sabotaged my own birthday and apparently have been self sabotaging my own marriage for the past year. My husband and I are in couples counseling but right now our therapist is getting re-certified and isn’t available for appointments, and with the move keeping us busy we just thought we’d be ok. I have not seen my individual therapist since my job started, I def need to. I feel awful and devastated that I basically broke this sweet gentle person and he thinks he’s a horrible shitty person. Idk what to do. Every time we fight I feel it gets worse and worse and I go from being absolutely fine to suddenly becoming suicidal and having thoughts of self harm and wondering if we should divorce. I wonder if he thinks the same. He knows I have self harmed in the past as a result of an argument we had. I’m so scared we are not right for each other and I’m so scared right now to lose him. I told myself I’d never be in a relationship again where I cry constantly from being hurt or contemplate thoughts of self harm. Idk what to do anymore, I feel hopeless about us too. 

Idk, I guess in my head I just thought he was really focused on the furniture shopping and I felt my birthday this year wasn’t as much a priority. I’ve been wanting to get my hair cut, my nails done, buy skin care products and makeup and take advantage of Black Friday sales…I haven’t been taking care of myself and am literally out of all my skincare routine to the point I either don’t have any products or I’m squeezing little bits of makeup out. My face looks really bad. And he knows I’ve been wanting to do more self care right now, but sometimes it feels we need to discuss the furniture stuff first while I’m trying to shop for my stuff. And then I put that off to discuss furniture shopping with him. 

Idk. I ruined my own birthday. I ruined my marriage. I broke my sweet husband to the point where now he hates himself. I hate me too. I don’t even want to celebrate being 30 anymore, it’s not worth it if I am hurting the person I love most. 

What do I do to fix this?

1h2w6od,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1h2w6od/critique_my_south_america_itinerary/,Critique my South America itinerary!,"Hi everyone! In a couple months I'll be graduating and I've decided to go on a backpacking trip after to celebrate, this will be my first one solo! I've never been to South America so I'm really quite excited, and over the past couple days I've been looking into a suitable itinerary. Would love to hear anyones thoughts! I really love photography (especially wildlife), hiking, checking out local cuisine, I'm a big history nerd, and a bit of partying here and there. I want to start sometime in early March and fly home end of June. Initially I also thought about going from Colombia through Ecuador to Peru but with the recent unrest there I'd rather not do that as a solo traveller and instead fly to northern Peru from Colombia. 

* Panama (1 week) 
   * Fly into Panama City, get over my jetlag, visit the canal zone and maybe a wildlife park in the city. Then sail from San Blas islands to Cartagena in Colombia.
* Colombia (4-6 weeks) 
   * Start in Cartagena, spend a few nights there
   * Then go to the Santa Marta area and visit Minca, Tayrona, Palomina. Chill out a bit, party, and do some hiking near Minca and Tayrona. Also heard going to the northeastern desert area could be cool.
   * Then  to Bogota via Barichara, San Gil, and Villa de Lleyva with the bus, and stop a day in each village to check out the more rural parts of Colombia, and maybe do some adventure activities in San Gil.
   * After that I want to go the coffee region and visit Salento or Filandia, Jardin, do some hiking, drink coffee and chill out.
   * Finish Colombia in Medellin and visit Guatape from there too. I figuredt maybe doing a week of Spanish lessons in a city here. If anyone knows a nice school or place I'd love to hear it! I also thought about doing the loop the other way around by flying from Santa Marta to Medellin and then to Bogota via the coffee region and skipping the smaller villages east of Bogota.
* Peru (4-6 weeks) 
   * Fly from Medellin to Chiclayo (cheaper than going from Bogota apparently). 
   * Go to Huanchaco and surf for a couple days there. 
   * After that I want to go to Huaraz and do some hiking (Laguna 69, Panorama hike, but no big treks). 
   * Then go to Lima, maybe spend a day here, although I've heard Lima is not the most exciting city. Could also skip the previous steps and just start straight in Lima.
   * Go to Paracas, visit the islands, and after go to Huacachina, and go sand buggying.  
   * After that to Arequipa, maybe spend a few days there to acclimatise, do the Colca Canyon hike from here and maybe hike the vulcano there as well. Also saw there were some nice cooking classes here.
   * Then to Cusco and spend maybe 2 weeks here? There's a ton to do and I also want to start the Salkantay trek from here. I also think going to the Amazon in Manu would be really cool for a couple of days! Peru definitely seems like the coolest country on the list in my opinion. Could also be a nice place to take some Spanish lessons. 
* Bolivia (1-2 weeks) - Bolivia was a little under my radar (besides the salt flats) so if anyone has any tips let me know! 
   * From Peru I want to take the bus to Copacabana, maybe spend a day or two there checking out Isla del Sol. 
   * Then go to La Paz, maybe do the Death Road cycling or maybe climb the Huayna Potosi. Also possibly go from here to Rurrenabaque to check out the Amazon (instead of in Manu)
   * From there I thought about either maybe directly going to Uyuni or checking out Sucre first for a few days. In any case seeing the salt flats is really high on my bucket list so I want to take a multi day tour there and cross from there into Chili.
* Chile (1-2 weeks)
   * Since Chile is a lot more expensive than the other destinations I don't want to stay for too long, but I'm a big space nerd and I want to check out the observatories of ESA here! Also maybe spend a few days in San Pedro de Atacama  since the surroundings there look quite otherwordly.
   * Then go to Antofagasta, see the observatories, and take the bus south and stop along some beach towns and visit Valparaiso on the way to Santiago, and then fly home. I haven't been able to find a lot of info online about places to visit in northern Chile so any tips are appreciated : )

Would love to hear any tips/critiques/do's and dont's!

I’ve been working in the UN system for three years now (1.5 years of internships, 6 months of IC, and 1 year of SC). So far, I haven’t lacked offers or opportunities, even without actively building a network. Maybe I’ve been lucky, but I feel like I’ve landed these contracts because I’m reliable and deliver good work.

That said, I often see advice on this subreddit emphasizing networking as key to landing positions at the UN, and it’s making me wonder if I’ll eventually hit a wall. I tend to keep all my workplace relationships professional. I’m friendly and approachable with colleagues but don’t actively seek out lunches or informal chats. My team is fairly large (around 20 people), and everyone knows me because I collaborate with most of them and consistently deliver solid, dependable work.

Still, I find small talk in hallways, group settings, or at the coffee machine awkward and uncomfortable. My office also doesn’t have much of a social environment—there’s only a pricey canteen I can’t afford on my current salary, so most of my interactions happen in offices and are focused on work-related matters.

What makes me second-guess myself is seeing some colleagues and ex-interns constantly approaching P-level officers they barely know to ask for lunch, hand out business cards, or network in ways that seem more about appearances sometimes putting aside their actual work for that. It’s making me wonder:

Am I taking the right approach to work at the UN as an introvert? Should I be rethinking my career if networking is critical in the long term? (especially as I can't fight it)

I’d love to hear advice or experiences from others, especially introverts who’ve managed to build a career in the UN.

I recently started driving a Bus for work and am having a hard time staying awake. I do better with more frequent stop and go passenger pick up/drop offs, but lately doing longer two hour drives between scheduled stops.

This past Wednesday I took 1,600mg of caffeine caplets (Walgreens “Awake”) over the course of only 5 hours. Start work at 5am, took 600mg at 7:30, another 600mg at 10:30 and 400mg at 12:30. I felt too drowsy to be driving if I had not taken the caffeine. I got a slight headache later in the day which I took an ibuprofen for. I went to bed at 9pm that night without any problems falling asleep. I had taken 1,200mg caffeine on Tuesday and 1,000 on Monday. I don’t usually make coffee at home in the morning or buy it. I am wide awake after getting up and taking a shower. I usually can only get 6hrs sleep for most of my adult life, before waking and ready to get up. 

I have read online about conditions that can arise from high caffeine intake - insomnia, restlessness, fast heart rate, headaches and dependency - so you need to take more for same effect.

1h2w3sq,https://www.reddit.com/r/salestechniques/comments/1h2w3sq/gatekeepers_and_a_little_tip_on_getting_by_them/,Gatekeepers and a little tip on getting by them,"Hi guys,

I wanted to write about something that strikes fear into the hearts of cold callers everywhere—the **gatekeeper**. Hitting that wall where the receptionist or assistant says, “Send us an email,” or, “We don’t take sales calls.” It’s frustrating, but the gatekeeper doesn’t have to be your enemy.

Here’s a key mindset shift that’s helped me massively: **the gatekeeper is not your obstacle—they’re your potential ally.** Their job is to protect the decision-maker’s time, and how you approach them makes all the difference.

# Here’s what works for me:

1. **Be Polite but Confident:** Your tone is everything. If you come across unsure or nervous, you’re done. But if you’re polite, respectful, and confident, you’ll stand out from the crowd.
2. **Use Their Name:** If they introduce themselves, I always repeat their name like I already know them. For example:
   * “Oh hey, Laura, it’s Bjarni. I Jim in?” It sets the tone for a friendly, familiar conversation and gets you past the usual defenses.
3. **Ask for Help:** People love helping—it’s just human nature. Saying something like, “Hey, I’m not sure if I’m in the right place, but could you point me in the right direction?” shows humility and makes them more likely to assist.
4. **Sound Like You Belong:** I’ll casually throw in a line like, “Is Mark in, or is he out for coffee again?” It makes it seem like I’ve called before and know the flow of the office.
5. **Handle Objections with Clarity:**
   * “What’s this call about?” → “It’s about your onboarding process—I was hoping to chat with Mark to save you some back and forth.”
   * “We don’t take sales calls.” → “Totally understand. This isn’t a sales call—I just have some information that could help Mark with \[specific issue\].”
6. **Leave a Message Strategically:** If all else fails, leave your name and number, but keep it simple: “Could you let Mark know Bjarni called? He’ll know what it’s about.” Gatekeepers don’t always dig for details, and I’ve found decision-makers often call back just to figure it out.

# The Long Game:

If you’re calling the same company repeatedly, build a relationship with the gatekeeper. Remember their name, be personable, and even ask about their day or share a quick joke. People are more willing to help when they feel seen and respected.

I broke this all down in a video with more specific tips, including how to overcome objections and build rapport with gatekeepers. If you’re struggling with this part of cold calling, give it a watch:

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but since it’s ‘kinda’ related I thought I’d post it here. 

Basically, I recently graduated, and am working for a CRE company. Today while sitting outside after work having something to eat with my gf someone came up asking where I got the food from as it looked good. We got to chatting and I found out he’s actually a director of wealth management at a big firm nearby and an ex-banker. I then proceeded to ask on any tips he had for getting into the field. He asked a couple of questions about me and I told him about how I’m doing the CFA, my background, and so on, and then said that it’d be great to have a coffee sometime soon, gave me his name and number and told me to message him about it. 

My question is, given I’m quite a nervous person (not necessarily awkward but just overthink these types of things), how do I reach out to him, when, what exactly can I talk about to him at our chat, and any other advice that you guys can give. For some extra context, it’s currently a Friday and there’s a public holiday until next Wednesday. 

I’d really appreciate any and all advice as I’m overthinking the hell out of this for some reason. It’s not like I’m trying to get a job/referral out of him (though it’d be great), but I still somehow feel that I’d be ‘taking advantage’. I know there’s a bunch of networkaholics here so any and all advice would be greatly appreciated.

Customers could sort by roast level, origin, and most importantly location. If in the United States users could filter by city, allowing them to find local roasters to purchase in person or online from. Each post would be simple, containing basic information about the coffee and a link to the roasters website page for that roast. 

The purpose behind this website is for customers to more easily find new online or local roasters and stay up to date with new roasts. 

Stretch goals would include:   
Ability for customers to subscribe/follow roasters and be notified when new roasts are dropped - release some burden from smaller roasters who may not want to spend money on dev costs for a feature like this.

Optional Roast Feed - a feed of new drops from roasters the users are subscribed to.

The website would be free for users, but would cost a monthly fee for roasters. There would also be a sponsored section where roasters could pay for better visibility, but other than that the website would not be biased towards how it displays roasts.

Regardless of monthly fee for roasters to use this site, the biggest issue I foresee is roasters needing to manually create, update, and delete roasts from the site. I imagine a lot of roasters don't have the man power to keep their roast profile up to date. But considering this site would be an alternative to online ads then the time investment could be worth while.

It always felt like we were “stealing” this money from our future selves.

We got married in August and I quit my job and threw away most of my belongings to move with him to Spain in September. Once we got here, he started using codeine and drinking all the time. He’s also a minister on YouTube. 

Since we’ve been in Spain, he’s kind as long as he’s high on codeine, drinking, and as long as I’m going along with whatever he wants. If I have a problem with anything he will say things like, “haven’t I done everything for you? What haven’t I done for you as your husband?” 

While he says this stuff, he hasn’t done much for me in terms of empathy or understanding about me changing my whole life to marry him and move to a different country.

He gives me 100 euros per week to live on, which is better than nothing. He pays for most of our food. At the same time, I said I wanted to get a job in science again and clearly doesn’t want that. 

He also acts like he loves Jesus more than anyone. I hope he does love Jesus and is saved. When he talks about Jesus, he starts crying a lot. I think it’s fake though. Like he’s crying to seem like he’s a better Christian than anyone. Recently he’s started telling me I don’t really understand the Bible and it seems really self-righteous. 

Anytime I bring up a problem I have with his behavior or mean things he’s said, he almost always refuses to apologize. He literally told me to go out in the street earlier because I told him if he didn’t leave me alone I was going to go outside. 

Earlier today he brought me a coffee and I spilled it all over myself. It was so hot that I have burns and blisters on part of my body. He acted kind and caring while he was high but the moment I said something to him about how I didn’t agree with what he was doing he turned on me again.

The first 8 months we lived in the same city. I had to move; we have been doing long distance since May. She is wonderful. We talk a lot and are open with each other. I am sure of her love.

At work she met Ian (M39). They are both freelancers and Ian connected her with a job. Some weeks ago Ian invited Lucy to watch a movie with his friends and colleagues, as they work in a big TV company and Ian would like to introduce them to her. She told me immediately, and I think it was perfectly fine. They are also in the cinema/tv production, so it is normal activity. I met Ian and he seemed nice. He knows I am Lucy’s BF.

Lucy invited John (M21) to come to the movie with Ian and the group. I also know him, he is a friend that is into movies. I am not in town. A couple days ago Lucy told me Ian may not come, he was busy. 

3 days ago I was talking with Lucy and asked if Ian was going in the end, she said yes. He told her that the real reason he did not want to go at first was that he does not like John, who he has met at work. He said “I do not feel like spending time with relationships that do not fulfill me”. Lucy told him to come anyways, and that after the movie they could split and not be with John, do their thing. Apparently, they will go to dinner at a Japanese restaurant. The friends that were going to be introduced were not mentioned anymore. Ian told Lucy that he was going to talk to her about another work opportunity that day.

My evaluation. Ian invited Lucy to meet his friends that are in the same field. But then when she brings John he does not want to come. I think the justification is bs, it is a group activity, the interaction with this person is very limited, the rest are close friends.

If Ian is not coming, he is not talking about the work opportunity nor presenting the friends? Wasn’t that the point? And he ditches HIS OWN FRIENDS? For one person in a whole group he does not like (but does not have a big problem with) he leaves the whole activity with his friends?

Then about splitting with the group. They leave together, something I think is very much a couples dynamic. If the purpose was to get acquainted with the friends and build rapport, shouldn’t they have dinner all together? You cannot really get acquainted in a movie. Side note: sushi place sounds super high effort and expensive for a chill chat. And if the job proposal must be done in person, why not a coffee in the afternoon? What about Ian friends? It is originally a “Ian and friends” activity that Lucy is invited to tag along. But then Ian ditches his original plan to do something with Lucy only?

To me it looks like Ian wants a date without acknowledging it. A sneaky date. When Lucy introduces a friend Ian flips and does not want to come, because it introduces a problem with his plan. He complains to get what he wanted: alone time. Ian previous relationship was with a F26 coworker. ",1,1732914792.0,AmItheAsshole,12,1.0,False

The school situated in the northeastern part of Devbhumi Town in West Bengal, India, is a really interesting yet scary place. Interesting because it's said to be the best around the whole town, and there’s no official name for it; people just call it ""The School."" Scary because five people have gone missing over the last 75 years, and they were never found again.

Mira, a young girl in the 11th standard (all students had recently been promoted from 10th to 11th), was talking to her childhood friend Anitta about how her boyfriend was no longer interested in her and was flirting with many junior girls. Anitta, bored 🥱 by her constant yapping, changed the topic and asked, “What do you think happened to Misty?”

Annoyed 😠, Mira replied, “I don’t know. It’s been more than a month since that incident. Don’t you think we should talk about other things?”
Anitta said, “No.”
Mira snapped, “That’s why you’re alone!” (She couldn’t finish her sentence as Mr. Jack, the geography teacher, entered the classroom).

The students greeted him with a “Good afternoon.” He started the lecture, and after 12 minutes of explaining the geopolitical history between Nepal and Bhutan, he diverted the topic and asked, “So, did you guys get any updates about that one girl who suddenly disappeared? What was her name again? 🤔”

A fair-complexioned boy sitting in the corner shouted, “Misty!”
“Oh yes!” Mr. Jack exclaimed. “Right, Misty. Looks like it’s been almost two months since that skinny girl disappeared after school.”

Diverted from the lecture, Mr. Jack spent the remainder of the class discussing the incident.

A little confused, a short yet extremely attractive boy, Neel, asked the teacher, “What was that incident? I’m confused.”

Jack sighed and said, “Ask your classmates.”
He left the classroom as the bell rang to attend his next class.

As Neel was new to the school (he had only joined four days ago), he only knew bits and pieces of the incident from overheard conversations. Misty, a skinny girl from his class, had disappeared after school one day, and nobody had seen her since. But Neel’s curiosity wasn’t satisfied; he wanted to know more. Unfortunately, most of his schoolmates were too egoistic and arrogant to bother answering his questions.

After school ended, Neel went straight to his economics tuition class. In the front row sat a beautiful girl with shiny brown skin, Shalu. The more beautiful she was, the more egoistic and arrogant she appeared. Despite this, Neel started taking a liking to her because, as the guy sitting next to him put it, “Damn, she’s a hottie.”

Neel looked at him, shocked.
The boy grinned 😁 and said, “Hi. You look new here?”
Neel replied, “Yes, my father got a transfer from his last bank. By the way, who are you? I see you for the first time in this class.”
The boy said, “These guys call me Abhi. I recently joined because, according to my grandfather, my economics is the weakest in the world. 🥲”
Neel asked, “How bad can it be? 🤔”
Abhi laughed and said, “Forget about that. Shalini, the economics tutor, must be coming.”

Shalini entered the classroom in a seductive manner, as if to show all the girls that she was still hotter than them.
“Oh my god, she sure is the curviest and milkiest MILF I’ve ever seen,” Abhi whispered.

Neel frowned, “Do you say things like this to every girl?”
Abhi replied, “No, only to the hot ones.”

Ignoring him, Neel focused on the lecture.

After almost two hours, the class finally ended. Neel was about to leave when Abhi tapped him on the back and said, “What’s the hurry? Let’s grab a coffee.”
Shocked, Neel said, “I’m not even 21 yet, and I don’t drink or smoke.”
Laughing 😂, Abhi said, “No worries, brother. I’ll treat you to some milk or coffee. How about that?”

Neel thought, This is the first friendly guy I’ve met. Everyone else acts like some celebrity straight from God’s ball sack.
“Okay, coffee sounds good,” he agreed.

Abhi took Neel to a nearby coffee shop, about 200 meters from their tuition class, called “Lit-Tea Coffee.”
As they entered, Neel remarked, “I thought you’d take me to Starbucks. 🙄”
Abhi laughed. “That place is too expensive. Plus, this shop is less crowded.”

He was right. There were only six people inside: an old man (the shop owner), a young, busty girl with shiny black hair (the waitress), and two female customers sitting in the corner.

Abhi whispered, “See that girl with shiny black hair? Isn’t she busty?”
Neel sighed, “Yeah, she is. 😑”
Abhi smirked. “She’s the main reason I brought you here.”

The old man glared at them, likely overhearing their conversation.

The waitress approached their table and said, “Hi, Abhi! What would you like?”
Abhi grinned. “Hi, Shila. I’ll take the usual—black coffee and a croissant.”
Shila turned to Neel. “And what about your cute little friend? 😙”
Abhi said, “Don’t ask me; ask him. He can talk!”
Shila smiled and asked, “Okay, what would you like, Mr…?”
Neel replied, “Neel Sharma.”
Shila nodded. “What would you like, Mr. Sharma?”
Neel said, “Just a cappuccino and a cheesecake.”
Shila said, “Your order will be right here, sir.”

As she walked away, she gave Neel a flirty side-eye.
Abhi whispered, “Dude, she’s totally into you. 😁”
Neel replied, “No, she’s just doing her job.”
Abhi insisted, “No, you dimwit. I’ve been coming here for five years, and she’s never looked at me like that!”

A few minutes later, Shila returned with their orders.
She placed Neel’s cappuccino and cheesecake in front of him and said, “Here’s your cappuccino and cheesecake, Mr. Sharma.” Then, with a smirk, she handed Abhi his black coffee and croissant, adding, “And here’s your bland coffee with bland bread. 🙄”

Abhi protested, “Don’t call them bland! They taste good.”
Shila giggled 🤭 as she walked away.

While they drank their coffee, Neel’s curiosity resurfaced.
“Hey, Abhi,” he asked.
“Yeah?”

“Do you know about the missing girl from the school?”
Abhi shushed him. “Be quiet. I know about the incident.”

Neel whispered, “Can you tell me what happened?”

Abhi stared at Neel for five seconds and then said, “About two months ago, a girl named Misty from Class 10-C didn’t come home from her tuition after school. Her family, worried, reported her missing to the police. The police searched the town for hours but found nothing.

“Days passed, and they decided to search her house. There, they found a pregnancy test kit with a positive result. Although the police knew she was pregnant, her family refused to believe it. To confirm, the police conducted a DNA test, which proved she was pregnant. They suspected she might’ve run away with her partner, but every potential partner denied involvement, including her boyfriend. Another possibility was suicide, but her body was never found.”

Neel asked, “How do you know she was pregnant?”
Abhi replied, “Everyone knows. They just don’t talk about it. Since you’re new, no one told you.”

Neel was shocked.

Abhi broke the silence, saying, “Listen, Neel, your family moved to a wicked town. Be careful. There are regular cases of robbery, mob lynching, missing people, and even murders.”

Neel looked terrified. Suddenly, Shila approached and said loudly, “Do you boys want anything else?”

Startled, Neel accidentally spilled his cappuccino on his green polo shirt.
Shila gasped. “Oh my god! 😯”
Neel apologized. “Sorry, you surprised me.”
Abhi laughed, “Dude, you got so scared you spilled your drink! 😂”
Shila frowned. “Not funny, Abhi. Neel, you should clean yourself up in the washroom.”

Neel nodded and headed to the washroom. While cleaning his shirt, he heard strange noises coming from a corner. Curious, he approached and found a slightly open door. He peeked inside and saw a skeletal woman with pale skin and bloody patches on her head, as if her hair had been forcefully plucked.

A man in a denim jacket was angrily holding her hands and speaking in Bengali. Suddenly, he smashed her head against the wall, causing blood to drip. Neel noticed a large pool of blood beneath her and realized it was coming from her crotch.

Suddenly that Man said something like ""Tumi nā halē āmi karaba"" And he picked something from the floor and started to push that thing into the toilet furiously, Neel suddenly realised What it was And screamed:-

F*ck it's a Babby😱

That Man  looked at the door hearing the scream

and started to move towards the door Neel Realized it was going to be his last day on earth suddenly someone held the hands of Neel and ran away.

I primarily work from home so I don't often get to see my colleagues in person, except when I have to go into the office once a month. When I met Beth I knew pretty quickly that I liked her and basically spent the whole work's party with her.

Personally, I thought there were some signs that it was going well, for example, she asked me if I wanted to walk back to the train station with her at the end of the night (which I did) and at one point, her best friend, who she was also with most of the night, left to talk to some other people while me and Beth were talking, and she hadn't even realised she left till about 3 minutes after. I took that as a pretty good sign. I was generally surprised how well it went, I'm very socially awkward and have basically no dating experience, so the fact that it seemed to be going quite well was surreal to me.

Over the next couple of days, I spoke to her quite a lot over Slack and built up the courage to ask for her number, which she gave me but clarified that she was pretty ""shit"" at replying (I can relate). At the advice of my friends, I decided to ask her out over text. This was a week after I met her which might've been a bit too soon, I dunno.

I basically said that I had the following week off and asked her if she'd like to meet up for a coffee. I waited about 8 hours for a reply and she said she was busy over the next couple of weeks, but didn't suggested an alternative date. Very unopen ended, which I took to mean that she wasn't interested.

We had some casual chit chat after that, so at least it wasn't awkward, but I was pretty bummed about the whole thing and stopped talking to her for a bit afterwards.

A few weeks later, I had to message her regarding a work related thing, but after that, we basically chatted to each other for the rest of the day and I suddenly remembered how much I liked talking to her. It was also really cool that me asking her out didn't make things awkward.

Eventually I asked her when she was in the office next (we have to go in once a month, but can pick our own dates). I saw her again in the office and thought it went quite, then a few weeks later, she actually asked me when I was going to be in the office, so she activity wanted to see me, which made me pretty happy.

Obviously, she did reject me once, but I still feel like there's something there. My insecure personally tells me that she was just being nice, but after she asked me when I was going to the office, it made me think that I'm not just imagining things. And even some of my work friends were surprised that she said no to me, because it looked like It was going well at the party.

So, do you think it's a good idea to try and ask her out again, or am I just massively overthinking stuff and should just move on?",1,1732914552.0,dating,6,0.66,False

I'm trying my hardest to stay true to what the town is actually like, but I'm also taking some creative, fictional liberties (the biggest things being the made-up coffee shop the main character works in and a seasonal ice skating rink built in Enchantment Park).  **What I'm asking is if anyone has any tips/details that I could/would overlook that would ruin any kind of credibility.**

Here are some details that could affect this.

2) The main character and her best friend grumble about tourist season. Is this something locals do? Also, how bad can the tourist season get? Seeing as MC and best friend both work at a cafe (a made-up one for story purposes) that becomes popular around tourist season, they grumble a lot.

I might update this if I can think of any other things that go along with this post, but any kind of local insider info is greatly appreciated!

I don't like having to go to bed and wake up earlier, I'm too tired and groggy to be lifting and plus after I do workout now I have to go to WORK for 8 hours lol 

I know for some it gives them a boost of energy for the day but for me I find that I rather go to work and then hit the gym on my way home. Yeah the gym might be packed but I have the most energy. 

Not only that but because I've eaten a bit throughout the day it helps me with my lifts. Where as I feel weak as fuck lifing at 6am. I know I could just eat something small in the morning but I don't like eating in the morning. I'm just not hungry and it makes me nauseous. Only water and coffee for me from 6am-12pm.

Anyone else relate? 

Edit: Of course some may not have enough energy at the end of the day after work because maybe that have a more strenuous job. Those are a legitimate exception.",3,1732914504.0,DoesAnybodyElse,6,1.0,False
1h2vvfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1h2vvfh/husband_31m_and_i_30f_fought_on_my_birthday_long/,Husband 31M and I 30F fought on my birthday. Long post but please I am desperate and at an all time low. Where do I go from here? ,"Hey guys, I just turned 30 this past Tuesday. For context, it’s been a really busy month for the both of us. I just started my new job in healthcare and there’s a huge learning curve, I’m supposed to be working 8 hour shifts at the hospital 5x/week but recently it’s been moreso 11-12 hours 5x/week. My husband and I also just moved out of my parents house and into our own apartment 2 weeks ago. 

My sweet, sweet husband has been unpacking everything and setting up our entire apartment. I can honestly say he has done 90-95% of the work and I’ve done maybe 5-10%. Everything is literally up - our beds, bookshelves, coffee table, even the TV mount have all been assembled thanks to him.

He asked me about a month ago what I wanted to do for my birthday, I had no idea and told him we can figure it out later. Last week I started crying bc I kind of felt like he was really focused on the furniture shopping, I got worried that we’d just do furniture shopping for my birthday. He comforted me and told me “ofc we’re not furniture shopping on your birthday silly, I’ve  been planning this for months. I know you like surprises so I didn’t tell you.”

So Tuesday comes along, my husband had taken off from work for all of thanksgiving week but we had no plans other than thanksgiving at his sister’s on Thursday, bday dinner with my parents and siblings at some point this weekend, and going to a really pretty garden that he and I go to every year as a yearly tradition. He threw out some ideas about maybe seeing a movie together on Tuesday or going out for dinner, I said that sounds great and I would try to get out early at 3:30 like I’m supposed to but if it gets busy I might not be able to. It didn’t seem like there was anything specific planned including the movie that day so I just didn’t think too much about setting the boundary at work that I needed to leave on time that day. And unfortunately instead of getting out at 3:30pm I got out at 6pm. I got home and my lovely husband had gotten me delicious food and even went to two different places to get it, and he got me wonderful gifts too. And he brought a shitload of my stuff from my parents house that I’ve been wanting to put up here. And that was pretty much it. I noticed he didn’t get me a birthday card this year, he always does for our anniversary, Valentine’s Day, and birthday and it always has a heartfelt message. I was a little sad about that but didn’t say anything about it. 

Well fast forward to Thursday before we leave for thanksgiving dinner my husband asked when we can go furniture shopping, I said between having dinner with my family and going to the garden it’s really just Sunday, and he said he didn’t love the idea of waiting til Sunday but sure. And then he asked more about furniture shopping and if we can do it online in between all my birthday celebrations, I said sure but I just wanted to make sure we did have time to celebrate my bday.

He could sense my disappointment, we talked, I told him I really appreciated and loved what we did for my birthday but I guess I just wanted…to do something more? Something bigger? I was really looking forward to my 30th. I guess I just didn’t expect Tuesday to be a one and done sort of thing for my bday when it came to just the two of us celebrating. I was hoping to go out and do something together, maybe a dinner or something after we went to the garden. But even then I guess I just felt like my husband was focused on furniture shopping to set up our home and I was worried the garden wouldn’t happen. Anyway, I wish I was better at articulating at the time bc the convo escalated and we started getting upset and yelling at each other. He said I had not given him any ideas or told him what I wanted to do for my bday and he’s not a mind reader so I can’t be upset since I didn’t tell him. 

I guess he was just always good at surprises and it was a lapse in my judgment to not communicate what I wanted. For past bdays he took me to the aquarium to pet a beluga whale, took me to a wonderful art exhibit, last year was chill and we just had a thanksgiving dinner with both our parents. I guess I just thought this year would be different. For his 30th birthday I took him to a really nice bed and breakfast in a small town and got him presents, 3 birthday cards, and later I arranged a get together with all his friends at a  nerdy brewery and got him a cool Harry Potter themed cake.

“I’m sorry this year wasn’t as great as previous years. I thought you have been so busy you wanted a chill birthday and to celebrate it in our new home together. You want all the fun but none of the effort. basically what I’ve done isn’t enough for you. We have dinner with your parents, we’re going to the garden this weekend, you want to do a birthday celebration with your friends next weekend, what more do you want?” Is what he said. I tried to tell him I appreciated everything he was doing but the damage was done and I hurt him deeply. We argued some more and yelled at each other and almost ended up not going to thanksgiving dinner. He called his parents to tell them we weren’t coming, my parents called me and I told them we weren’t coming bc we were fighting (I know… shouldn’t have done that). My mom, his mom, his dad, and my dad thought I was in the wrong. “You ruined thanksgiving, you’ve done enough damage. This whole weekend has to be about you?” is what he said. He expressed how alone he has felt in setting up the apartment and how I haven’t “done jack shit”. I told him I’ve just been so busy adjusting to my new job and I was going to help unpack and set up stuff this weekend but it just seemed like he was so focused on the apartment I just didn’t feel I was as much a priority. And that every time I came home to see how much he had unpacked and set up I was grateful but deep down worried it would breed resentment just bc I was tired when I got home and wouldn’t be able to do much until weekends.

So I ruined thanksgiving dinner and something he was really looking forward to. We ended up going but we were so late and we just went to appease our parents. We didn’t even go earlier like he wanted to bc I took too long cook and get ready, I crossed respecting his time boundary which is something we have talked about in the past. I crossed the boundary of telling my parents which is also something we discussed in the past. 

I heard him talking to his therapist this morning (I know…another boundary crossed). I think I broke my husband. He sounded absolutely heartbroken and crushed. I have never heard him sound like this. So low. Last night he was so depressed and apologized saying “I messed up your birthday I’m sorry.” …Here he is trying to set up our home for the two of us, he was prioritizing me by basically trying to set up our home comfortably for our new life together, and I basically spit back in his face saying it’s not good enough. He told his therapist he feels so hopeless and at an extremely low point in our marriage and doesn’t feel like any of his efforts are recognized or that whatever he does for me isn’t good enough. We’ve had problems in the past and we attributed it to us living with my parents or his parents, now that we’re on our own we still have problems. The therapist said it sounds like no matter what he does I am never happy and even if he was the perfect husband I still wouldn’t be happy….I didn’t know I was like that but now I can see it. And I think I am the problem. I get so hypersensitive to his tone of voice or the things he says and I read too much into it and make assumptions and I cry and cry and that makes him feel terrible about himself and it hurts the both of us. The therapist said he needs to prioritize himself when he’s feeling low like this and do some self care, even if it means cancelling plans with me. I hated to admit but I agree.

We just got married last year. I thought our first year of marriage would be happy. Right now idk if our past year has been happy, I’m feeling really low right now and all I can think of is all the low points and arguments and fights we’ve had. Before we moved to our apartment we got into an argument bc I was on my period, had a rough day, and then read too much into his tone thinking he was mad at me and ended up having an argument with him where he kicked me out of his car bc he felt like he couldn’t breathe and needed space. Basically when I posted about that on here everyone said that was not cool and it’s valid that I asked my parents for a ride and got them involved. When my husband and I are great we are great, when we are not we are both extremely reactive and hurt each other with words and actions. 

I’m so scared you guys…I feel like a shitty person who just self sabotaged my own birthday and apparently have been self sabotaging my own marriage for the past year. My husband and I are in couples counseling but right now our therapist is getting re-certified and isn’t available for appointments, and with the move keeping us busy we just thought we’d be ok. I have not seen my individual therapist since my job started, I def need to. I feel awful and devastated that I basically broke this sweet gentle person and he thinks he’s a horrible shitty person. Idk what to do. Every time we fight I feel it gets worse and worse and I go from being absolutely fine to suddenly becoming suicidal and having thoughts of self harm and wondering if we should divorce. I wonder if he thinks the same. He knows I have self harmed in the past as a result of an argument we had. I’m so scared we are not right for each other and I’m so scared right now to lose him. I told myself I’d never be in a relationship again where I cry constantly from being hurt or contemplate thoughts of self harm. Idk what to do anymore, I feel hopeless about us too. 

Idk, I guess in my head I just thought he was really focused on the furniture shopping and I felt my birthday this year wasn’t as much a priority. I’ve been wanting to get my hair cut, my nails done, buy skin care products and makeup and take advantage of Black Friday sales…I haven’t been taking care of myself and am literally out of all my skincare routine to the point I either don’t have any products or I’m squeezing little bits of makeup out. My face looks really bad. And he knows I’ve been wanting to do more self care right now, but sometimes it feels we need to discuss the furniture stuff first while I’m trying to shop for my stuff. And then I put that off to discuss furniture shopping with him. 

Idk. I ruined my own birthday. I ruined my marriage. I broke my sweet husband to the point where now he hates himself. I hate me too. I don’t even want to celebrate being 30 anymore, it’s not worth it if I am hurting the person I love most. 

What do I do to fix this? 

TL;DR: Husband I fought on my birthday. I started a new job, we recently moved. He put in his best effort given all circumstances and I made him feel like that wasn’t enough. I’ve broken him and hurt him deeply and this just adds onto his feelings of hopelessness through your 1 year of marriage. What do I do? ",1,1732914410.0,Marriage,0,1.0,False

I just won a brand new La Marzocco Linea Mini Espresso machine in a coffee charity’s prize draw, but despite the name it’s a pretty big machine for a small galley kitchen and I just don’t think I have the space to set it up. Reluctantly, I’ve decided I will probably just have to sell it, as I won’t be solving the space issue anytime soon.

Being a fan of the channel, before I made the decision final by listing it for sale I headed straight to YouTube channel to try to get the expert opinion on exactly what I’d be giving up (or if it was truly unbelievable what I guess I’d be trying to build an extension to house?!) - but I haven’t found a review by James of this particular machine.

This gave me an idea - would it be somehow possible to sell the machine to James to review and pass on to one of the patreons? Obviously on the selfish side it would solve my issue of having to sell it, but I’d also absolutely love to contribute in some way to a review video, and I’d also be much happier knowing it was eventually going to a real enthusiast rather than to be an expensive prop in some big fancy kitchen.

No idea if that’s possible or how I’d get the ball rolling if so, but this seemed like a good place to ask for advice, either on this specifically or if it’s a non-starter does anyone have advice on how to sell to enthusiasts rather than people trying to kit out show homes?",4,1732914373.0,JamesHoffmann,2,0.83,False

Thaw came onto Valen like an avalanche of warmth and colour. Remnants of snow slipped off roofs and puddled in the streets, were swept away by the increased foot traffic of merchants and tradesmen flowing in from the countryside. Caravans had crossed the passes and brought the roar of life from every corner of Vas.

Events of the Night of Descent still lingered in the minds of many as Quistis noticed on her final rounds of Valen. Falor’s battle with Cinder had become the stuff of alehouse legend, told and retold with a thousand new embellishments by people who were there, weren’t there but had heard, or whom simply parroted whatever version had caught their fancy.

Some of them were quite creative.

She featured in some, though she hadn’t ever laid eyes on the fabled sorceress.

Valen had been the longest station of her career to date, aside from Aztroa Magnor itself. It was time to leave it behind and be redeployed. Falor had received communication from the Empress herself that they were to return to the capital and prepare for a different service.

He’d not mentioned what it was. Or where. But there would be a period of respite and retraining in Aztroa.

This was her final round of Valen. She took the time to have a cup of tea with Laric and wish him well, passed by the nameless place she and Falor frequented for a last cup of coffee, and even accepted to spend some pleasant time with Lucian. If she were a more sentimental woman, she expected she would feel at least a bit weary of change.

Instead… well, what did she feel?

Worried. Terrified. Weary indeed, for many different reasons.

She allowed herself some private thoughts as she climbed the stairs to the Fortress where the rest of the cell mustered. Her sister was… somewhere, being someone Quistis didn’t know. She was still blood, even with everything Aliana had told her of Dreea’s work for the Empress. That, more than anything, Quistis felt as a failure of her own. She shouldn’t have pushed as hard as she had, shouldn’t have encouraged such ambition, should have seen the signs earlier on…

But she hadn’t. And until Aliana contacted her, she’d thought her sister safe, doing their family proud in service to the Empire. More fool she.

Guilt twisted in her gut as she rested upon one of the open dais overlooking Valen from the Daylight Wall. Neptas crested past the blue mountains, warmth streaming across the thawing land. Quistis’s hands were cold and she blew on them, achieving nothing.

Mertle made preparations according to the plan. She would make her way to Aztroa. Quistis herself had written the invitation for lady Tianna of Aieni Holding to join the Storm Guard in the capital as a prospective recruit. Part apology. Part recognition. All interest on the Empire’s side to ensure there would be no repercussions from winter’s blunder on the part of the Aieni Holding.

Falor hadn’t been happy when he’d signed the document. He’d stared at it for a long time, grumbling unkind things about Rumi’s role in all of it. In truth, Rumi had done Quistis a service with her meddling. It allowed her to argue on behalf of Tianna, as even the mind-skinner had to admit the woman could be an asset. Properly trained and guided—a role Quistis was more than happy to take on herself—she could probably end up leading her own cell some day.

Still, she was bringing Mertle in terrible danger. Lucretia and Deidra would be following the same route to Aztroa, doing what they knew best up to there: sowing doubt, opening eyes, striking for change.

Valen’s red roofs shone in the early morning light. She’d miss the sight. Not the smell of smoke and ash… maybe even that, a little. Aztroa certainly was no perfume by comparison, but its stenches had fewer implications.

Ten years in Valen. A drop in a deep bucket of time, but too much. It made it easy to forget the rest of Vas wasn’t as kind or as quiet.

A gust of chill wind cut through her as she finished the climb up the side of the wall. Her boot had sprung another leak and puddle water seeped into her two pairs of socks. Every other step squelched to her great annoyance. It helped banish her private musings ahead of reaching the muster.

“Ayo, Captain.”

Vial fell into step with her as she neared the main courtyard. He had a grey rucksack on his shoulders, and a brand new atagan clattering on his hip.

“Taken a shine to Barlo’s weapons, I see?” She’d also picked up a fresh staff from the nighttime bazaar. She had it wrapped and carried it hung on her back. It was ashwood and lighter than her old.

“Aye. Figured I’d get a proper blade for wherever we’re sent next.” He gave her a side-glance. “Where are we going next?”

She shrugged as they joined the press of early busybodies, “No bloody clue. Falor’s keeping mum.”

“My gut says we’re going to the Twins. It’s been too quiet there. Never a good sign.”

She grunted a response. The Twins hadn’t been quiet by any measure of the word, but Falor had already sent a cadre of mages there to deal with the garrison’s commander’s requests. They’d yet to get word back about the situation.

Vial whistled a tone-deaf tune as he walked two steps ahead, opening up the way for her. They headed for the gate. She’d already packed earlier—not that she had much to pack—and her chest would be among the first things sent through. She’d seen enough of the Fortress for ten years that she didn’t feel the need for one final stroll on the draft-strewn corridors.

Her affairs were in order. She’d passed on her responsibilities to a pinch-faced man of Valen’s constabulary, drafted her reports to Diogron and the rest of the Council, and handed over all cases that had been taken up by the Guard. Strictly speaking, they hadn’t had this as a responsibility, but after a year of waiting around for Cinder they’d taken over random parts of the city’s protection just for something to do.

Funny how much *something* had ended up needing doing.

The muster was nearly complete. Falor had a cell of a hundred able-bodied men and women spread across Valen. They were all gathered here now, in the courtyard, at attention while Barlo inspected the ranks. Less than a hundred, but some had simply made the transition to Valen’s constabulary. Families had been established here, children born, roots dug in.

Quistis did not envy those that chose to remain. Valen was quiet now, but it wouldn’t stay that way for long. She knew that much of what was coming.

Ahead, the gate stood ready, its tar-like portal glittering in Neptas’s first light. Barlo sent groups through, checking names off his list. Falor was on the up-raised dais next to the gate warden, overseeing his men.

She joined him. He wasn’t wearing his white regalia for this last day as Valen’s protector. Instead, he was dressed in rough-looking civilian clothes and wore thick-soled boots fit for long marches. It was as if he was prepared to be redeployed the moment he stepped through the gate, orders effective immediately. For a brief instant she worried of her own choice of boots.

“You’ve started early,” she said by way of greeting. “Can’t wait to get back to Aztroa?”

“The men are eager to go back home.”

“Most of them were going anyway mid-summer.”

“Rotation was this year?”

She nodded, “Time flies.”

Something in his eyes said there was more he’d like to speak of, but kept back. He’d been doing that all winter and by now she’d gotten used to the long silence. Deidra had brought word of plenty of things that would weigh down on Falor as a commander of the Storm Guard, so she expected this was just one more of the Empire’s many matters.

She spied Rumi and Aidan within one of the final groups that Barlo sent through.

“Still angry at them?” she asked.

“Hmm?”

“Rumi and her claw.”

“No. But they’re not really mine, are they?” He had his warhammer head down on the floor, pommel resting against his calf. “Rumi’s made that clear by not following the chain of command. Mother is welcome to her spy.”

She’d always considered Rumi a way for the Empress to keep an eye on things in Valen, but hadn’t ever heard it from Falor’s own mouth. There was a hint of bitterness there.

Barlo was left alone with Vial in the courtyard, the last group gone through. Well, no time like now.

After a brief Valen salute to the gate warden, she turned and walked down the stairs towards the other two.

“Shut it down.” She stopped mid-step and turned to see Falor still there, arms crossed, as the warden signalled to his men. The gate shut down with a hiss of escaping steam, its low thrum dying into soft echoes.

“What’s going on?” she asked. “Why aren’t we going through?” This wasn’t part of the plan.

“We’re not going to Aztroa,” Falor said as he shook the warden’s hand and saluted by both the Imperial way, and Valen’s own. “We’ve a different assignment.”

Oh no. Panic flared in her chest for a moment before she could suppress it. Mertle would already be on her way to Aztroa. The plan was to meet up there in disguise and Quistis to introduce her to contacts and support within the walls.

This wasn’t part of her plans!

“Wh-what do you mean? The Empress called us back. I saw the order.”

“She did.” Falor jogged down past her, his warhammer on his shoulder. There was a smile on his face as she hurried to join.

“Then what’s going on?”

Barlo rubbed his hands as they joined him. Vial’s confused glance met hers. “All good, Commander. Everyone’s through. No stragglers.” He turned an eye on Quistis. “’Side from th’ obvious.”

“What’s going on?” Vial asked, looking from her to Falor and then to Barlo. “Where we going?”

Barlo hefted another rucksack and offered it to Quistis. “Took th’ liberty, by the Commander’s order. Yer chest’s gone ahead.”

A second package he handed to Falor. All of a sudden, it made sense to Quistis why the commander wasn’t dressed in his Imperial regalia. He’d planned this.

Of course he had…

“We’re not going to Aztroa, I gather?” She was uncomfortably aware of the leak in her boot now, and realisation dawned grimly.

“We’re not, no.” Falor grinned and his eyes glittered with mischief. “We’ll get there. Eventually. For now, we’ve got a different matter I aim to look into.”

They all followed him down from the gate’s platform, into the courtyard, and down the long steps heading towards the elevators.

“You knew?” She threw an accusing glare at Barlo.

“Aye. Sworn not to tell. Y’know how he gets.” The vanadal walked with his usual confident gait, head held high, eyes on the horizon.

Vial followed in their wake. She saw him casting one look to the gate, then to the fortress, ended his ruminations with a shrug, and fell into step with Barlo. He had no family in Aztroa proper, nobody waiting for him to show up from his long deployment. His face showed quiet acceptance of this new development.

Quistis hurried and matched Falor’s long strides.

“So where are we going actually? The Empress will have a whole litter of kitten when she won’t see you at the muster.”

“I’ve sent word. My mother’s temper will blow and Rumi’s probably going to get punished in some way for the surprise.” He shrugged. “Why do you think I haven’t nailed her hide to the wall in the first place?”

“You were planning this.” It wasn’t a question, but grim realisation that she’d been blind. Egg on her face.

“Aye.”

“Where are we going, Commander?”

He grinned wider. A ray of bright thaw light caught in his dishevelled hair.

“We’re going on an adventure, Quis. I aim to see what’s at Drak’s Perch.”

“…the prison?”

“Aye. Let’s see how we treat our prisoners, shall we?”

And like that, the playful glint in his eyes was gone, replaced by something blood-chillingly angry. Quistis dropped a step back, but followed nonetheless. Each other step squelched.

When I first saw her I thought she was absolutely stunning. But I thought nothing of it, just a pretty girl in my classes. But I kept seeing her everywhere and eventually saw her and one of her friends outside of one of our labs and I thought this is a nice chance to introduce myself and talk about our classes.

So I catch her after one of our classes and simply asked if she'd like to go grab a coffee sometime cause I'd love to get to know her better.

1h2vo8o,https://www.reddit.com/r/adhd_anxiety/comments/1h2vo8o/med_sleep_self_care_going_through_it/,"Med, sleep, self care going through it ","Started out with Adderall and the problem was that I keep waking up in the night.  

Got on Ritalin and at first it seemed ok.  

Started having these major anxiety attacks on Ritalin.  They are incredibly intense.  Unlike adderall, they persist rather than get better when I move around. 

The anxiety  makes me feel like I can’t do anything but live in it.  

It’s the coffee I realize now, that and if I am not feeling well, from taking it anyways ( after lack of sleep). 

My doctor recently started me on gabapentin and my sleep problems have pretty much disappeared because I can fall back asleep so much more  easily.  

I’m going to try to go back onto the Adderall because I felt a lot better then, perhaps if I continue taking the gabapentin at night I’ll still be able to sleep through the night a lot better still.

At this point, I’m solidly convinced that it’s sleep apnea mixed with narcolepsy.  

1) when I wake up my throat usually hurts and my heart is beating very fast been having same symptoms for years.  I tried to record myself and didn’t really hear anything so I didn’t think that it could be possible but then I found out later that some people make absolutely zero noise with sleep apnea.  

2) I have always started dreaming almost immediately and a lot of times before I even completely asleep which I found out recently actually that that is a form of narcolepsy.  I literally could barely stay awake during the day. I get really tired around noon matter what and this has been forever.  Even if I got enough sleep the night before.

I’m honestly tired of all it. I don’t wanna do anything. I just wanna wash my hands of all of it and take like a two month break from meds and from work, live on a Mexican beach but you know that doesn’t really work that way.  

Unfortunately, I have to work and keep a job which I’ve struggled for years to do because I often fight with people from a long term extreme sensitivity.  Adderall seems to nix that issue where Ritalin it’s the same bs.  

As much I hated feeling like I just landed from the moon every night on Adderall, as I was increasing to higher doses on the Adderall I was actually starting to want to get dressed up and to look my best.  I think that that’s something that I needed to have, I’ve kind of turned into like this homeless looking Schub looking bummy on Ritalin now.  

As the last ditch effort since I’m going to see my doctor in about a week, I decided I’m going to try to take a much lower dose of the Ritalin and see if it helps at all I’d rather it be out of my system for work but it doesn’t seem possible.

For now just literally cannot drink coffee not even one more time and that’s certain, the anxiety attack I had this morning made me feel like I was in hell.  I never had that on Adderall although I did have anxiety from time to time never that extreme or long lasting.

(31f),"So I (31f) met John (41m) 3 months ago. We're very different people but we connected in a lot of ways. He seemed pretty set on being in a relationship with me so we moved faster than I normally do. Within the first few weeks I gave him a toothbrush and toothbrush bag at my house. 

Yesterday I realised it had been 3 months since I gave him his toothbrush. I bought a new one for myself and it came in a pack of 3, so when I was feeling a bit tired and not thinking, I replaced his brush at the same time that I replaced mine. I tipped his toothbrush bag in the bin and thought a razor had fallen out (I didn't realise that he also had razors in there, I thought it was just the toothbrush). So I checked in with him about it casually over message to check how many razors he'd had in the bag originally (to make sure I didn't tip any out accidently), and he went totally cold, didn't say goodnight that night or good morning and the next day messaged saying that ""I shouldn't have gone through his stuff"" and that I ""ruined his day"". I really hadn't thought about it like that, I saw it as simple as replacing an old bar of soap or washing his socks. But it seemed to deeply affect him, he said he hasn't had much stability in his life so knowing he had something at mine that was his. I've apologised again but he keep reiterating ""don't throw my stuff away"". Which I have responded with apologies saying I wouldn't do it again each time. 

I've apologised a lot and taken time to think about it from his perspective, I should have asked first and I've learnt that. I explained in seperate messages from the apology (so I wasn't creating an ""I'm sorry, but.."" situation) that it came from a place of care and that I've learnt my lesson and won't do it again, but he's still angry. 

This isn't the first time that he's been triggered by something I've done offhandedly. There's even been times that he's gone off in a huff and hasn't messaged in 3 days after I had a day where I was a little quiet and stressed out following a conversation him and I had. He called me a picky eater and said it was his pet peeve and picky eaters triggered him. I felt like this was unfair, because I've travelled the world and eaten all kinds of food, so I was probably a bit moody after and this lead to him calling me a pain and ignoring me for 3 days. Another time he got angry that I was going for coffee with someone he thought was an ex (he wasn't an ex, just an old friend) and he went off and sent me sharp messages. 

In all of my relationships before, I have never been the person that messes up this much. I've had some relationships where the whole time we've either never argued or maybe had one disagreement. 

I'm usually extremely patient when a partner messes up, but this means I have found myself in a few relationships where they really push it, because they know that I'll forgive them or patiently talk with them about their behaviour after. 

We have a lot of fun together, he's opened my eyes to many things and he encourages my passions. We've had a lot of giggles and when things are good, they're good. I'm aware that I've triggered my partner, but is this behaviour normal or does anyone have any advice on how I should go forward? Is this reaction warranted? I know I did mess up to a certain, but I just want to know if this reaction is warranted as I feel like he's made me feel like a terrible partner for this. I would welcome any advice on it.

There were few people who wanted to bakę cakes for that and he was soo worried,  so I spent several hours baking around 30 cupcakes, and went to school early to stay at the cake stand. I stood there and sold stuff for 2-3 hours.

He was very kind, and made me Coffee.

But then, when I stayed to clean, I could not get the totally burn out candle that stood there out of some wooden decoration. My teacher told me something very cruel out of sudden, he told me I'm ""only good in breaking things.."" , the he also could not get candle out and scrubbed it out with a knife ( as I suggested btw).

Also, there was a Concert at My school that day, and girls from My class complimented some girls singing. He said ""well at least she's good at something, but definitely not smart in education"".

Okay sorry for such a long post. But what the teacher said triggered My deepest insecurities. I even cried (I am not  an emotional person) and wanted to ask, should I take it seriously..? Why did he became so mean out of sudden? Taurus girl here (but kinda relating to Aquas as I have many Uranus aspects, I did not understand it tho )

Additional info: I did mess up in the past, but I have adhd, and the teacher has adhd too, and did mess up many times too. I did not damage any equipment that day.",0,1732913709.0,aquarius,0,0.5,False

For as much as Spider-Man is described being a working-class superhero, class is rarely analyzed in these stories. On account of the demands of the genre, the mainstream superhero action-adventure, Peter Parker rarely expresses ‘class consciousness’ in any direct sense. This post looks at the Lee-Romita and the Early Gerry Conway runs (ASM#39-139), focusing on the subtext of the class background of the major status-quo setting of this period.

Have to say that I researched the Lee-Romita era for work and ended up having a ton of fun. The entire L-R run has quite a few underheralded gems (some I talk in passing there).

**ASM#48** which includes the first time you had a Spider-Man fight in a major NYC landmark. In this case it's the George Washington Bridge, and yes, the other bridge story with Gwen Stacy is absolutely inspired by this early fight.

Another great issue is **ASM#65** \- The Impossible Escape, one of the most fun issues in the run. Captain George Stacy's best showing as a supporting character, and an issue that looks forward to all stealth games.

It's amazing to me that as much as the number of adaptations bring up the Parker Home in Queens, or emphasize Spider-Man in Queens, it's forgotten that between 1966-2008, Peter stayed in Manhattan and that his longest continuous dwelling is a Chelsea apartment that is now gentrified into impossibility.",1,1732913563.0,Spiderman,0,1.0,False

Nung nareveal na boss ko nakabunot sakin, everyone ay natuwa and me too, kasi parang may mindset na mas bongga ang gift ko kasi boss yun eh haha. Nung nag open na ng gift, nagulat ako kasi mga sticky notes, ballpen, random office supplies yung laman. Akala ko pa nga prank lang and baka may iaabot sa huli pero yun na pala yun. Tapos nalaman ko pang galing din yun sa stock room namin sa office. I know kasi ako nga taga order and nabasawan yung stock and yun yung pinang gift sakin. May pa disclaimer pa si boss na super busy daw kasi nya di sya nakabili ng gift, humabol lang sa party. Nagawa nya dumaan sa Starbucks for her coffee pero di nya nagawa dumaan saglit para buy ako gift or kahit gift card nalang huhu.

Sobrang inggit ko sa iba kasi personal stuff nareceive nila samantalang ako, related sa work tapos masaklap kinuha pa mula sa work.

5 years later, sa isa ko pang pinagwork, boss ko ulit nakabunot sakin. Ang gift nya ay coin purse na may tag pa and konting mantsa. Tas nalaman ko na nirecycle nya yung gift, binigay lang din sa kanya nung isang officemate.

Here are my reviews of three local non-Starbucks places I've tried for this purpose, based on my own idiosyncratic criteria.

# Coffee Code, Rosecrans and Euclid

Possible to escape from music: yes, by going outside

Hot drip coffee available: yes, before 11 am

Outside seating available: yes

Let you use your own cup: no

Staff: negative vibe

This place is somewhat claustrophobic, and it can be difficult to get a seat at a table inside. In the summer, the outside seating is too sun-exposed for comfort except in the early morning.

# Little Ox, near Euclid and Commonwealth

Possible to escape from music: no

Hot drip coffee available: no, ""hot"" = room temperature, and drip coffee is only available before ca. 11 am

Outside seating available: no

Let you use your own cup: yes

Staff: super nice

A big place. Crowded. Dog-friendly. There is a glassed-off side room with power outlets, which seems to have been intended as the study/work room, but actually it's usually the area with the most auditory distractions, such as people doing video calls or playing cards. Quieter study spots are the bars by the front door or by the bathroom. I don't like the fact that you can't escape from their music, but mostly the music they play is not too objectionable (60's rock and soul, etc.); however, they are currently playing nonstop Christmas music, which I can't stand.

# Lu Lu, Lincoln and Commonwealth

Possible to escape from music: yes, if you sit outside

Hot drip coffee available: no (and a ""hot"" latte was room temperature)

Outside seating available: yes

Let you use your own cup: yes

Staff: OK

I've only been here once so far. There is a very pleasant outside seating area with shade from apple trees. Not crowded. They want you to order using a giant touch screen, which is an extremely slow and complicated process, but they seem willing to let you just order verbally if you're paying cash.",6,1732913078.0,Fullerton,2,0.88,False

I'll keep this very short. 

I just got back from 21 days over in England, I saw some great spots, the tower of London, York, a tiny village in the cotswolds with a >1000 year old inn, Stonehenge, bath and much more. 

A big tick for historical Britain! 

Modern britian didn't fair as well, overall, outside of the nice villages in the countryside everything was run down and near deralict. 

This is especially true of London, from being the capital of the world's most powerful country to an actual piss smelling shithole in a few centuries is impressive. 

I cannot impress how bad it was over there, I feel bad for the working class English because they get such a bad deal. 

Not to even mention how expensive everything is, like holy, I don't know how anyone treats themselves to anything nice. For context, fuel was 3.20aud/L most coffees I had were ~$10aud.

I am planning to start a small garden in the spring (8x4 to start!) and figured no time like the present to get a compost started! 

I bought a 43gal tumbler last week (you can see it in the back!) but after picking up some coffee grounds from Starbucks I quickly ran out of room in it, so I decided to start a second bin! 

It’s around 4ft diameter, my size 7 boot is in the foreground for scale

Wire framing from some old fencing my parents had lying around. 


Greens are mostly Starbucks grounds for now. 


Very open to constructive criticism, this is my first time, I know nothing!!

The Lee-Romita and Early Conway era is unique for being the first time that you had Spider-Man interact with people from higher social classes than him, with him living it up in the Upper West Side in Harry's Pad, and having a girlfriend who's high society. But how does class actually get reflected in these stories, and what does it mean for Spider-Man's (once) brand identity as a working-class hero.

For as much as Spider-Man is described being a working-class superhero, class is rarely analyzed in these stories. On account of the demands of the genre, the mainstream superhero action-adventure, Peter Parker rarely expresses ‘class consciousness’ in any direct sense. This post looks at the Lee-Romita and the Early Gerry Conway runs (ASM#39-139), focusing on the subtext of the class background of the major status-quo setting of this period.

Have to say that I researched the Lee-Romita era for work and ended up having a ton of fun. The entire L-R run has quite a few underheralded gems (some I talk in passing there).

**ASM#48** which includes the first time you had a Spider-Man fight in a major NYC landmark. In this case it's the George Washington Bridge, and yes, the other bridge story with Gwen Stacy is absolutely inspired by this early fight.

Another great issue is **ASM#65** \- The Impossible Escape, one of the most fun issues in the run. Captain George Stacy's best showing as a supporting character, and an issue that looks forward to all stealth games.

It's amazing to me that as much as the number of adaptations bring up the Parker Home in Queens, or emphasize Spider-Man in Queens, it's forgotten that between 1966-2008, Peter stayed in Manhattan and that his longest continuous dwelling is a Chelsea apartment that is now gentrified into impossibility.",7,1732913045.0,afriendlyneighborhood,1,1.0,False

I (now 32M) started my last relationship (at 20 years old) in 2012. One year in, I tried ending the relationship but she guilted me to stay with her. She was manipulative and at the end, was physically abusive.  Over the next 6 years, I had 3 different occasions of cheating sexually on her. I was too scared to speak my mind and end it. Eventually I had the balls to leave her. She punched me in the face the day I told her I was leaving her. That should sum up her personality. Can’t really speak highly of myself after knowing I cheated. Doesn’t make it right. Anyways..

I don’t feel good about the cheating and never did tell her but promised I would speak my mind in my next relationship and be committed and honest. 

Fast forward to 2019 and I meet my (now current wife 25F). At the time she was 19, I was 26.  Things were going great for us. 1.5 years into our relationship, one day she tells me she’s going to study for her CNA test. I told her I would bring her food and she said “no that’s ok and not to come meet her”. This was unusual for her. We shared locations so my curious got the best of me. I checked her location. She was at a bar. I drove there. Turns out she was with her Ex. Who was in town. I saw them talking out front of the bar and he seemed upset. She seemed like she was comforting him. I left. Went home. 

I checked her location over the next hour, she leaves the bar, goes to a random house location, is there for probably 30 min. Leaves, comes home. 

I asked her how studying went at the coffee shop. She said good. I called her bluff. Basically told her I saw her at the bar. She said her ex was in town and suicidal and she met to talk with him as he wasn’t doing good. I never confronted her about going to the undisclosed location for 30 min. I basically tell her just to be honest about where she’s going and I can understand. She didn’t say anything.

Fast forward again to this year 2024. My dad had a stroke in April. He was hospitalized for 65 days and in the final weeks at the hospital, I started remodeling their home to prepare for his return home in a wheelchair. One day as I’m gone, she tells me she’s going to a new bar with coworkers. I always said yeah that’s fine, thanks for letting me know. When she got home she apologizes she didn’t get home when she said she would, she said she ran into some regulars that go to her coffee shop and had beers with them. I said “no
Big deal”. 

The next day I’m at dad’s again, I get that weird feeling again, so I checked her location. She told me she was off that day at 5pm. I check at 5:20 and She’s at the same bar. This time she didn’t tell me. I don’t think much but am now curious. Initially she said she liked the beers there, so I just figured she’s back with coworkers. 

A week later we go to the county fair. She invites coworkers and says she’s also inviting her friend, Cody who is a regular at her bar. We get there, Cody shows up, and my wife immediately introduces us and walks away, leaving Cody and I stand there. The whole night is like this where she talks to Cody and if I walk up, she immediately stops talking to him and it’s as if she’s avoiding being there when I’m interacting. During the night, Cody tells me that we should all go to get a beer sometime and that we could go to the bar that him and my wife went to. I put Two and two together and realize this was who she was with on that second day at the bar. Maybe even the first. 

 To make things shorter, I ask her about it and she says she didn’t think she had to tell me about getting a beer with him because I was busy and she didn’t want to stress me out with worrying about her. I ask to see her phone and their messages and she’s been texting him for months. Mostly them complaining about their work to each other. There were days they grabbed lunch together. Several occasions of meeting in each others Parking lot to smoke weed together. And an instance where she is thank him for helping her on a few things. A lot of his complaints to her is how he’s new to town and doesn’t mingle with people and how his family is fucked up and how he wants to be a good family man some day, etc. 

My wife never really confides in him but there were instances in her talking more in depth about stuff than what she would talk to me about. 

Overall, i can’t help but feel like this was some sort of an emotional affair, but I feel guilty knowing I wasn’t faithful in my last relationship. 

AITAH for being upset at her for not communicating these things with me? Did she not disclose these things because she thought I was going to be upset like the day with her ex.

Since this, I’ve been to therapy to rework how I process her actions as well as my own actions. I’ve learned a lot but there’s still this underlying distrust towards her. ",3,1732912809.0,TwoHotTakes,19,0.62,False

1h2v9bt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1h2v9bt,21 Day Fasting Reset ,"Good Afternoon everyone, I hope everyone had a filling thanksgiving, Lord knows I tried. 

Started 2:30 AM EST, I decided to start my timer and go for a 21 day water fast. From November 29th, 2024 to December 22nd, 2024. 544 HOURS.

My last meal wasn't too large, for some reason i've built up a small stomach, so I did not eat much yesterday even though I wanted to.

SW: 358.5 / GW: 175.0 / M21

During this fast, I want to lose weight, expand my mind, and strengthen my spirit. I will be aiming for at least 11k steps a day and will be documenting how I am feeling everyday, possibly every 8-12 hours, like a diary entry with weigh-ins when I wake up. 

For the first 7 days: I will be drinking water, if my craving start to bite my ass, i may have a diet. 11k steps.

For the next 7: I will only have water and may start incorporating pushups and other small body weight exercises.

For the remainder of the fast: I will aim for the stars and push!

I know I have spoken with a couple people who are joining me on this journey, but if you would like to join me feel free to. We can connect through my posts or thru group messages.

Questions for other fasters: 

What does black coffee do for people as I have seen others say it ""helps"" with their fasts?

What electrolytes do you suggest I take?

What signs should I look out for?

What helps you mentally prepare for a fast like this and helps you get through it.

I went to go pick up a sandwich from a place down the street from my apartment and there was a group of teenagers that went in to the sandwich place. 

I was ordering my sandwich and coffee and the employees immediately started yelling at the group of 6 teenagers that came in. This sandwich place has a sign that says “no unaccompanied adolescents in groups of more than 2”. These teens told the employees they were going to buy something, but the employees were very adamant about getting them out of the store. I thought the employees were overreacting a bit because the teens didn’t do anything and were just sitting around. They eventually left after a couple of minutes and I waited to get my coffee and sandwich.

I left the sandwich store and was walking back to my apartment and saw the group of teens standing around  in between the sandwich place and my apartment building.

1h2v0q3,https://www.reddit.com/r/travel/comments/1h2v0q3/england_was_a_disappointment_mostly/,England was a disappointment (mostly) ,"I have just spent 21 days in England, with time spent in  London, bath, York, West Yorkshire, and the cotsworlds.

For context, I love all things history, all things medieval, all things viking, on the surface - England ticks all the boxes. I really really thought I was going to love England. 

Im currently writting this as I am sat on the plane for the 15.5 hour journey home to Australia and reflecting on the trip, I have to say I'm feeling quite underwhelmed. 

Firstly let's start with the good so that the whole tone of this isn't all negative, because there was some great spots and things to see. 

Seeing Stonehenge was a bucket list item which for me was great, we had a very knowledgeable tour guide who was very informative. 

The tour of the Tower of London then seeing the crown jewels was spectacular, it was literal treasure with all the gold and jewels they had. 

I also spent half a day touring the British mesuem was probably the highlight of the trip and been a dream of mine for many years. 

Touring a village in the cotsworlds was straight out of a fantasy with tiny little stone cottages everywhere where we also had a pub meal in a >1000 year old inn. 

Seeing the surviving wall paintings from over 400 years ago in bolsolver castle was really impressive. 

York as a whole was great, well maintained, friendly people, the city walls and York minster was a highlight. 

Now let's move on to what totally put me off. 

1) everything was astronomically expensive, fuel was $3.20aud/L, most sit down meals out anywhere was > $120aud even just at a pub for 2 people, Starbucks (basically the only coffee I could find that I was 1/10th acceptable) was >$10aud a coffee. 

2) Noone seemed to particularly have any manners, in Australia you'll constantly hear, ""thanks, sorry, cheers"" when moving about, my experience in England was that even if you move out of someone's way, they don't offer any thanks and just stay silent. Granted this was better the further I got away from London. 

3) for a country as rich as England, everything outside of main touristy areas or rich areas was run down, delapodated or just poorly maintained. Seemed like unless you were ultra rich you just had to deal with where you live looking like actual garbage, this is especially true of London. Basically most of the small towns and villages were nice but any larger towns or cities from what I saw (with the exception of York) was deralict. 

4) the london underground, I can only compare this to Tokyo's train network, and it's not even close. The london underground was mostly super hot, smelled liked fumes or piss and was generally in a poor state. 

In closing, I don't know if it's because England being a western country and it being easy to compare to Australia (and it losing in almost every regard) has tainted my experience over there or it's actually just that unimpressive.

I have only previously traveled to Hong Kong and Japan, both of which have their problems but I don't recall comparing to Australia because they were just so different, and I loved both of those holidays, especially Japan.

I've been on a mission to find activities that are not just educational, but also keep my little tornado entertained (and me sane).

# My Top 5 Lifesaver Learning Activities:

1. **Kitchen Science Experiments** 🥄 Okay, hear me out - this is WAY more fun than it sounds! We do simple things like:
   * Mixing colors with food coloring in clear cups
   * Watching salt or sugar dissolve in water
   * Creating ""magic"" volcano eruptions with baking soda and vinegar Pro tip: Throw an old shirt on them and embrace the mess. Cleaning up is totally worth those sparkling curious eyes!
2. **Sensory Bin Adventures** 🌈 I'm not crafty, but even I can handle this. We use:
   * Uncooked rice or pasta
   * Small toys to hide
   * Measuring cups My 2-year-old will play quietly for *hours* (okay, maybe 20 minutes, but it feels like hours). Bonus: It helps with fine motor skills!
3. **Dance Party Learning** 🕺 Who says learning can't be a full-body experience? We:
   * Practice counting during dance moves
   * Sing alphabet songs
   * Play ""freeze dance"" with educational twists My living room turns into the most ridiculous (and fun) classroom ever!
4. **Nature Scavenger Hunts** 🍃 Even in our tiny backyard, we:
   * Look for different colored leaves
   * Count rocks

I’m a huge fan of filter coffee and recently got myself a Timemore 078 grinder. That said, I also enjoy the occasional espresso,especially in summer when I’m craving an iced Americano. For those, I use a Picopresso with a La Pavoni mod and a 1Zpresso J-Ultra grinder.

Here’s the (maybe dumb) idea I wanted to run by you, if it’s stupid, please go easy on me! :)

What if I use the 078 to grind my beans at its finest setting and then “finish” the grind with the J-Ultra? I’m wondering if this approach might make the process less tedious and, more importantly, if it could actually improve the quality of the grounds. Would the more uniform initial grind from the 078 have a noticeable impact on the final espresso grounds from the J-Ultra?

I’m planning to test this tomorrow using the same beans and aiming for consistent pressure (though I don’t have a proper pressure gauge).

Would love to hear your thoughts or experiences with something like this!",1,1732911494.0,espresso,3,1.0,False

Hey there!

Greetings from the land of corn 🌽🌽🌽 

I'm a 30-year-old non-binary person looking for a caring, dependable Domme and partner. I'm interested in building something that could potentially be long-term, as I believe the best D/s relationships grow over time together. I'm seeking a genuine connection and someone willing to put in the effort to nurture it.

About me:
- I lean towards androgynous/masculine presentation, am pretty tall at 5'11"" (6' in my Docs 😌), have a slightly curvy figure (these hips don't lie!), short blondish hair, blue/green eyes, and wear glasses. I have tattoos, slightly stretched earlobes (just 1/2""), and I'm always planning my next ink.

- I highly suspect I may be autistic but haven't received a medical diagnosis. I do struggle with getting overstimulated and have some sensory issues. I identify as demisexual and sapphic, and I deal with anxiety/depression. I appreciate a partner who is understanding and patient, especially on tough days. Some days are easier than others, so having someone who gets that or shares it themselves would be ideal (if you know what the spoon theory is, huge bonus points!). Let's support each other through our rough patches!

- I'm politically liberal/leaning towards the democratic side and would prefer a partner who shares similar values.

I like to think I have a good sense of humor, enjoy working with my hands, reading, writing my own stories, and enjoy a nice cup of coffee/tea while knitting (I'm quite crafty, let me shower you in scarves). I adore my garden, being outdoors when the weather's nice, riding my motorcycle (when I can!), cooking, occasional baking, and listening to random podcasts (especially true crime). I'm currently learning a second language, enjoy walking and hiking with my great dane, creating things for my cats (ask me about my literal cat tree!), and doing volunteer work. Despite life's current challenges, I'm trying to be a kind person and find joy in everyday moments. (My secret to getting through? Spite! 😂) I'm also child free by choice due to genetic reasons.

I tend to info dump and can go off on tangents, but I enjoy deep conversations and learning new things. I'm not big on small talk and appreciate genuine interactions. Deeper discussions are more my style, but I'd also love to listen to how your day went and all the little stuff you're doing (I'm a great listener/cheerleader 😊) and send eachh other silly gifs/memes. 

In terms of kink:

- I'm very service-oriented, which extends to my kink preferences. I like being guided through a scene, following orders, giving up control during play, and have a variety of toys for a Domme to choose from for long-distance play.

- Everyone has unique desires, so I'd love to explore kink with someone whose preferences align with mine. I'm not strictly a pillow princess (at least not always lol), and I'm open to taking the lead occationally if my partner desires/needs it (though I don't consider myself a true switch).

Deal breakers:

- Communication is key for me. We're all adults, and I understand life gets busy. However, lack of communication is a major trust/deal-breaker for me (right up there with crossing hard limits). I like sending my partner little messages like a ""good morning"" and receiving a response, ensuring we're both present. I don't like feeling like the only one who's putting in the effort to initiate conversation or carry it by myself. If things aren't working out or the spark fades, I prefer open dialogue in ending things over being ghosted. I struggle with partners who go silent for days, and would not do well with one.

- If you're not a fan of dogs/cats, we might not be a good match since my great dane is a big part of my life.

- I don't have a specific ""type""; I'm more drawn to vibes, but confidence and competence are major turn-ons for me 😊 

- I will not trust a Domme who doesn't know the basics (like the stoplight system), or one who claims to know everything/has no limits. I know what I want out of a D/s relationship, and expect respect to go both ways in one.

I'm into:
- Submission (obviously! 😄)
- Bondage/rope play
- Training
- Toys
- Following orders or being given tasks
- Bratting (rarely, but when the mood strikes)
- Spanking/impact play
- Teasing/overstimulation
- Orgasm control (multiple or denial)
- Funishments 
- More, but to be discussed with further communication 

Hard Limits:
- Degradation (due to personal reasons)
- Age regression
- Anything bathroom related 
- Violence or weapon-related play (consensual non-consent and primal play are off-limits for now)
- Pet play (I respect it but it's not my thing!)
- More, also to be discussed through further communication 

We can exchange selfies once we've chatted more and both feel comfortable with it. I also have a discord for easier communication.

Thanks for reading this far! If you decide to reach out, tell me your current favorite song (what's on repeat for you right now?).

Looking forward to connecting with you!

I'm considering buying a Flair 58+, but I was wondering based on your experience if it would be possible to make coffee with 7-gram portions.

I'm asking because I'm coming from experience with a semi-automatic machine and a 53mm naked portafilter, and I've found it quite good. I'd like to make the jump to a fully manual lever machine to have control over temperature.

My question comes from the fact that I see Flair 58+ users starting from 16g, and being used to Italian espresso, that seems too much for me :)

TLDR; Small fish in big global pond or big fish in much smaller newer pond that wants too be a bigger pond


Working in a role for 9 years where I’ve learned my trade advising clients on their  personal finances. 

Today I’ve been asked by the head of a company to have a chat on Monday about a possible role for me at their place should I be interested… the meetings been arranged for Monday AM over a coffee beside their offices. 



Current Role

Top tier firm where I’ve been since the start and progressed through the ranks. Now theoretically one level behind the head of the team who essentially oversees all work but gives me a good level of autonomy. I’m on a comfortable salary but who doesn’t want more in any situation. I’ve got a good year of work behind me and a very strong pipeline of work going into 2025. 


Potential New Role

Smaller form and I would be brought in as a Director to help them build up the team in the specific niche I specialise in. They don’t have much footing in  the space yet but are wanting to develop it as they see it as a key growth area. From a public perception, could be seen as a downgrade…. 



So I’m looking after some advice on what I should do or maybe more of what should I ask the company on Monday. A set of questions that would be key would be great! 

Am I just nervous that I’m being asked to clip my wings where I’m in a position where a lot of my work and clients are handed to me on a plate, and I’m being asked to essentially drive new business. Of course I’ll have all my contacts but only so much of that is realistically transferable I would imagine. 

I’m wary that staying in the current role where a promotion isn’t on the cards as far as I’m aware could stagnate my career. Do I want to be a lifer as some say? 

In terms of pay, I would be expecting there to be an increase of c.52% plus benefits which I’m assuming at the moment will be very similar to my current benefits. 


I appreciate anyone’s thoughts who’s taken the time to read this and look forward to hopefully having a more in depth think about it over the weekend. Thanks
