1fv495f,https://www.reddit.com/r/travelchina/comments/1fv495f/feedback_from_our_september_trip_to_hong_kong_and/,Feedback from our september trip to Hong Kong and China,"Hello, this sub has been very useful while preparing my trip to China, so I thought I could return the favor.

I went to China the last 2 weeks of september with the following itinerary: Hong Kong (3,5 days) -> Zhangjiajie (3,5 days) -> Chongqing (2 days) -> Yangshuo (3,5days) -> Shenzhen (0,5 day) + Hong Kong (2days).

**Payment**: I set up Alipay (including passport verification) from the EU 15 days prior my arrival and linked it to my international credit card (from an European bank). My wife managed to set up her WeChat account with her facebook account. Overall, everything went fine and we did not use cash at all. Over 95% of our payment went through Alipay without issues. 

In HK we used Octopus, cash and credit card.

Notes: Alipay does not work in Hong Kong if you're not chinese and be careful with your bank limitations before coming (I had a weekly maximum number of payment that caused some issues).

**Internet**: My wife had China included in her mobile plan so no problem on her side. In my case, I took an esim from 3HK ([30-Day Pass - Greater Bay Area 30GB](https://www.three.com.hk/prepaid/DIY/en/offer/travel)). I printed the QR code and scanned it with my iPhone when I arrived in HK airport. Then I had to do passport verification (i.e taking a picture of it) and it... did not work at first. I got the verification confirmation but internet was not activated. I went to a 3HK store and from what I see, the employee just reseted the network settings (?) and everything went fine from there: I had internet without restriction in both HK and Mainland. I also bought a VPN (Let'sVPN) for WiFi but I barely used it.

**Tranport**: I used [Trip.com](http://Trip.com) to book all my train tickets, the service is really good. I pre-booked my tickets as soon as they were available for pre-booking (\~2months prior) and had only two trips that weren't confirmed 15 days before departure. As soon as I realized, I booked the ticket myself (different class or time) and canceled the original pre-booking. Once in the station, you just need to show your passport in the foreign queue machine and it works fine. Sometimes the machine does not recognize your passport (10% of the time for us) so an employee needs to manually verify your passport. 40min in advance is usually more than enough but be careful as some train stations can be huge.

For public transport, we used Octopus in HK (bought at the MTR office at the airport) that we topped in 7-elevens. In Chongqing and Shenzhen we used Alipay (transport tab > select city > get pass and then you need to enter your passport details again). You then have a QR code that you scan in and out of each station. Overall it is very cheap.

We also downloaded Didi **once in China** and linked my credit card. I got an error message at first that my card was not accepted and then a confirmation that it was ok by SMS (?). In the end, it was working and I highly recommend Didi as it is extremly cheap and convenient. We also used Uber in HK.

**Language**: English is widely understood in HK so no problem on this side. In China, as expected, nobody spoke English. However, I was suprised to see that in touristic areas and public transport, most signs are translated in English. I had Google Translate with Chinese and English pre-downloaded in the app. With the conversation mode (very useful!) and the photo mode, we managed to do everything we wanted (even a full conversation in a bar) without speaking a word of mandarin. 

---------------------------------

Overall we had a truly amazing experience in both HK and Mainland ! 

HK: Pleasantly surprised, from an European perspective, the city is really different from what I see everyday. It's busy, vibrant and full of energy. There is not so many touristy things to do (a few days are enough), but the atmosphere is really incredible, and its nice to just walk aroung Mong Kok in the evening. We chose to split as follow: 1st day Kowloon (Mong Kok, Avenue of the Stars, Temple Night Street Market), 2nd day HK Island (Monster building, Man Mo Temple, HK park, Peak and Lugard view, rooftop bar and 3rd day Lantau Island (Boudha + Tai O). On the 4th day, we went early to West Kowloon station to take the train to Shenzhen (and then Zhangjiajie). We came 2hours before the train departure but the whole immigration process took 40min (note that we were there around 6:30am also).

Zhangjiajie: We had our hotel in Wulingyuan, 10min walking from the park entrance. The park is incredible, it is really really beautiful. I prepared my itinerary a bit beforehand so we had no issue to navigate the busses and other transportations. We spend 2 days in the park, usually walking from 8am to 4pm before heading to the hotel's pool. I think 2 days is sufficient to see most of the park on a easy pace. The park is touristy, but well managed so the maximum time we had to wait in a queue was around 15min. Near the park entrance, there are many restaurants, a small market and some public karaoke in the evening. The 3rd day we went to Furongzhen which is very pretty, but also very crowded and touristy.

Chongqing: maybe the most disapointing part of the trip. The city itself is impressive, especially during sunset and in the evening, but I was expecting a kind of Shenzhen vibe and it is not really the case. The city seems to live off tourism so most of the stores are tourist shops selling the same stuff over and over again (except city center which is full of western brand). Every 30s someone comes to you trying to bring you to his shop or trying to sell you something (and some are *very* insisting), which after a day of walking in the heat is really annoying. We split our days there as follows: 1st day Hongya cave + Qiansamen bridge, 2nd day Ciqikou + Liziba station + Jiefangbei (including WFC tower sky view).

Yangshuo: we booked our hotel close to the Yulong river. The landscape around Yangshuo and the vibe is stunning ! I highly recommand riding a bike along the Yulong River and I more than recommand seeing the show Impression Sanjie Liu (probably the most beautiful show i've seen). Bamboo rafting is also great. The famous western street is ok for one evening, but expect a loud and touristy place with bars and clubs. We also spend a few hours in Xingping and I think we could have spend more time there. There are many small coffee shops and restaurant that seemed great. 

Note: little shout out to our hotel: [Yangshuo Ancient Garden Boutique Hotel](https://www.trip.com/hotels/yangshuo-hotel-detail-7299331/yangshuo-ancient-garden-boutique-hotel/). The staff spoke very good english (a first during our trip!) and we're full of good advice. They made us feel very cocooned and took care of everything (ticket booking, transportation, tea tasting, etc.) I highly recommend it.   


Shenzhen: we spent only a few hours there before heading back to HK (Ping An tower + Coco Park) but I would have loved to spend maybe a bit more time (1-2 days). 

  
Out last 2 days in HK were mostly focused on relaxing at the hotel's pool, shopping and restaurant, so nothing else to add.

  
Let me know if you have additional question

1fv48jz,https://www.reddit.com/r/Coffee_Machines/comments/1fv48jz/best_automatic_drip_coffee_maker/,Best automatic drip coffee maker,"The convenience of an **automatic drip coffee maker** is hard to beat, especially on those groggy mornings when you just need a good cup of coffee without much effort. However, not all drip coffee makers are created equal—there are subtle details that really impact the quality of your brew. After doing my homework and testing a few machines, here are the standouts that I recommend, based on their brewing performance, ease of use, and overall value.

# 1. Technivorm Moccamaster KBT

If you’re serious about coffee and willing to invest in top-tier quality, the **Technivorm Moccamaster KBT** is hands down one of the best. It’s a bit of a splurge at $329, but this machine is worth every penny for a few reasons. First, it has a **copper heating element**, which is key for quickly heating water and maintaining the optimal brew temperature of **between 194°F and 205°F**—which is essential for extracting all the flavors from your beans. It holds this temperature for 91% of the brew cycle, which is why the coffee always tastes balanced and rich.

What really stood out for me was the **brewing speed**—it consistently brewed a full pot in about six minutes, which is perfect for maintaining flavor without over-extracting or brewing too slowly (some machines take way too long and ruin the taste). The **thermal carafe** is another highlight because it keeps the coffee hot without the need for a hot plate, so you don’t have to worry about overcooking your brew.

The downside? It’s definitely pricey, and some users have mentioned uneven water dispersion from the showerhead. But honestly, I didn’t notice that impacting the taste much. It’s also a bit bulky, so make sure you’ve got the counter space. Still, if you want consistently excellent coffee, this machine delivers.

**Benefits:** Perfect brewing temperature, quick brew time, durable design, thermal carafe. **Downside:** Expensive, takes up a lot of counter space, and uneven water distribution could be a minor issue.

# 2. Zojirushi Zutto

For those who want a solid automatic drip coffee maker without breaking the bank, the **Zojirushi Zutto** is a fantastic value at **$70**. While it doesn’t have the premium features of the Moccamaster, it performs well for its price point. It brews quickly, and the flavor is decent, especially if you don’t let the coffee sit on the hot plate for too long (more on that below).

The biggest drawback here is the **glass carafe** combined with the hot plate. If you leave your coffee on the hot plate for an extended time, it can start to taste burnt or overcooked. It also has a smaller **20-ounce capacity**, which means it’s better for smaller households or for brewing just one or two cups at a time. If you don’t need to brew large pots of coffee and prefer to keep things simple, this is a solid option.

**Benefits:** Affordable, compact, and great for small households. **Downside:** Glass carafe with a hot plate can overcook coffee if left too long, and the smaller capacity isn’t ideal for larger groups.

# 3. Breville Precision Brewer

For those who like to customize their brew, the **Breville Precision Brewer** offers the best of both worlds—precise control and ease of use. I loved the fact that it has **programmable temperature controls**, so you can adjust the brew temperature and even tweak the bloom time, which makes a big difference if you’re picky about your coffee’s flavor. The **programmable timer** is also a lifesaver when you want to wake up to a freshly brewed pot.

I found that the Breville performed exceptionally well for brewing larger pots of coffee, but it’s not as fast as the Moccamaster. It’s also a little pricier than other models, but if you’re into tweaking settings to get the perfect brew, this is a great choice.

**Benefits:** Customizable brewing options, programmable timer, excellent flavor control. **Downside:** A bit slower than some other models and comes with a higher price tag.

# 4. Behmor Brazen Plus 3.0

If you love pour-over coffee but want the convenience of an automatic machine, the **Behmor Brazen Plus 3.0** was a pleasant surprise. This machine gives you full control over the brewing process, from adjusting the **pre-soak time** to the **brew temperature**, making it perfect for anyone who wants to simulate the manual pour-over experience. I enjoyed how much control it gave me over each aspect of brewing, which led to a more flavorful cup.

However, it’s not ideal if you’re only brewing small amounts of coffee. The machine really shines when brewing larger batches, so it’s best suited for coffee lovers who like to brew for a crowd or want multiple cups throughout the day.

**Benefits:** High level of control, excellent for pour-over fans, and adjustable temperature and pre-soak time. **Downside:** Not great for small batches of coffee, and the customization might feel overwhelming for some users.

# 5. Melitta Epour

The **Melitta Epour** was a great option for its **even water distribution** and ability to handle both large and small batches well. It has a **removable water tank**, which made filling it up super convenient, and a dedicated setting for brewing smaller amounts of coffee, which is perfect when I only wanted a couple of cups.

It’s not as flashy or advanced as the Moccamaster or Breville, but it’s a solid, middle-of-the-road option if you value even brewing and don’t need tons of customization.

**Benefits:** Even water distribution, removable water tank, great for small brews. **Downside:** Lacks some advanced features of more expensive models.",1,1727950065.0,Coffee_Machines,0,1.0,False
1fv47vd,https://i.redd.it/1msli1sbmisd1.jpeg,A year into my brewing journey,"So it has been a year, roughly, since I got sucked into brewing my own coffee. Started with a C2 and an Aeropress, then came along v60 and then a mokapot. Like brewing with the three of them, not equally though. 

Would like to get more inputs, from folks who’ve been in this journey for long, on ideal upgrades as a coffee drinker. Should it be different roasters within/outside the country, should there be an upgrade on the grinder to unlock/take the brewing experience to the next ideal state.

1fv47hq,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wholesomenosleep/comments/1fv47hq/theres_a_brick_wall_in_the_middle_of_the_street/,There's a brick wall in the middle of the street ,"It's not normal to see a wall in the middle of a street, right? I mean, maybe there was some reason that made sense for there to be a wall over the white line in the middle of the road. I could see the wall from where I was sitting by the cafe window enjoying my mocha latte. I was on a coffee date and the guy I met through the usual app finally took the hint that I want one of those cute little fudge brownie things they were selling; it was when he got up to go to the counter that I spotted the wall. 

I smiled when I first saw it because it looked so out of place. The wall looked old, made of bricks which were, like, very orange. I don't know much about sizes but I'd say the wall was maybe the size of, like, a door or something. 

My date set the plate with the cute little brownie I wanted on the table. I didn't actually intend on eating the brownie; gosh, the carbs! But on coffee dates there's a few ways a girl can test if a man really is serious about showing up. Not showing up for the date, I mean. But like, you know, showing up in the male provider role. If my date can't even buy me a coffee or a teenie tiny little brownie then he's definitely not going to be marriage material. 

He was cute; like seriously cute. Tall, dark, handsome; twenty-six but somehow looking closer to thirty-six but, like, in a good way. In a manly way. He dressed well; nice jacket, tastefully tight denim jeans that looked old but were obviously still kind of new. Mustard coloured shirt; umph! 

When I say he looked absolutely delicious sitting his big tall frame down in the seat opposite me, believe me, I mean it. 

""So what do you do?"" he said. 

""I'm an account manager for a mid-sized SEO agency,"" I said, ""Do you know what that is?"" 

His hazel eyes lit up with newfound curiosity. I decided to reward him with a smirk. I held his gaze and the interest on his face blossomed into a full-on handsome smile. 

""Nah,"" he said, ""What's SEO?"" 

I flinched as if smelling something bad. I didn't mean to but what idiot didn't know what SEO meant? 

""Search-Engine-Optimisation?"" I said, trying not to make him feel stupid for not knowing such a simple thing. 

""Oh,"" he said, ""Yeah we use a bit of that. Get spam emails everyday."" 

The wall was still out there in the middle of the street. How had no cars neared it yet? It was late Saturday morning and the road was often busy; for some reason no cars seemed to be coming or going. There was just the wall and nobody on the street was paying it any attention. 

""Lauren?"" said my date. 

I forced my attention back to him. By the way he said my name I guessed it hadn't been the first time he had said it just then either. 

""Sorry,"" I said. 

He smiled handsomely. He seemed nice. I particularly liked the way his large hands made the nice white tea cup he was drinking from seem small. 

""So,"" I said, drumming my nails on the table. 

""So,"" he said, matching my tone playfully. 

""You work in real estate,"" I said, ""You make good money."" 

His enthusiasm as he looked at me soured a little bit. I understood this wasn't the playful chit-chat he was expecting but, like, this was just a coffee date and it wasn't the only date I was going to have; the chit-chat could come once the essentials were discussed. 

""Do you see yourself getting married in the next two years?"" I said. 

He gave a single-shoulder shrug. 

""Because,"" I said, ""I'm like, looking to get married within about two years. I'm okay with taking our time but I have a timeline I want to stick to."" 

""Timeline?"" he said, smiling a little.

""Yes,"" I said, ""How do you feel about kids?"" 

There it was. The gormless, 'why are you asking me this?' look. I wanted to sigh and roll my eyes but that wouldn't keep him on the hook. So I moved ahead with 'old faithful' and sat forward, playing with my hair and giving him a feisty, playful look. 

After a few moments of not knowing how to respond my date grinned wryly. 

""Ah,"" he said, ""You got me going there for a sec. I thought you were serious."" 

""Oh, I'm serious,"" I said, ""I just have had my time wasted a lot and I think it makes sense for me to just let you know what I'm looking for."" 

""I appreciate that,"" said my date, ""But yeah, I'm not looking for anything serious right now."" 

For a half second I thought I was going to take this statement from him well. 

""Seriously?"" I said, the words spilling out of my mouth before I can care to stop them, ""You're twenty-six and you're not thinking about settling down?"" 

""Nah,"" he said, grinning and sitting back in his seat, ""I'm def not looking to settle down. I'm still young."" 

""But what are you even looking for in a relationship?"" I said, ""I mean, like I was pretty clear on the app that I'm looking for something serious. Did you not check?"" 

He smirked and scratched his eyebrow; both gestures made me want to grab the brownie from the plate and smush it all over his irritating face. 

""Look,"" he said, ""It was nice meeting you but unless you want to come back to mine then we're done here."" 

The audacity. The cheek! I wanted to scream at him, yell at him, let him know what a pig he was. When did a guy like him suddenly think he was good enough to invite me for a late morning quickie? I was speechless. 

""Um, no,"" I said. 

""Alright,"" he said, ""See you later."" 

He got up and left before I could think to say anything back. He hadn't even given me enough time to save face. What a jerk! I got up, leaving the brownie behind, and left the cafe. 

I had taken two buses earlier to get to the cafe (it was near where I worked which was just over an hour's bus ride from my flat), and I would need to take the same buses to get home. My next date was nearer home and was going to happen in the evening. 

I hadn't intended for the date to be over in like, ten minutes, but he was clearly not serious so it was good, in a way, that he wasn't going to waste any more of my time. I headed to the bus stop and waited for the bus to come. It was a really chilly morning and I hadn't really dressed for the occasion; I'd decided to go for this super cute one-shoulder top with a long cardigan fit; it looked great but didn't do much to stop the cold. 

The bus didn't come. I waited for over twenty minutes only to check on the route planner app to see the buses I needed had been diverted. My gosh. Seriously. What a freaking morning. 

Maybe the diversions had something to do with that wall in the middle of the road? Someone must have moved it because it was still at the same spot but was moved to be in line with the white center line on the road. This way cars going in both directions could pass the wall by. 

Whatever. I didn't care about the wall or why someone had put it there or why they had moved it. If my bus had arrived like it was supposed to them I wouldn't have given the wall another thought. 

I needed to think about how I was going to get home. The obvious answer was to book a ride through the app on my phone, but the rides were pricey, especially one to get me home. My second option was to call Mum and ask her for a lift, but she had said something about needing to take Flossie (that's what she called her car) in to get Flossie's brakes checked. My last option was to get a train but that would mean getting a bus to the next station and that seemed like a lot of extra hassle. 

After thinking about it for another minute standing out in the cold I decided to just grit and bear the walk to get a train home. I really didn't have the extra money in my account to waste on pricey rides home. I set off silently wishing I had taken the brownie after all since I hadn't eaten breakfast and had only sipped my latte, which I had also abandoned. 

My thoughts were stuck on my date and how quick he had decided not to continue the date. It was ridiculous. Not that he wasn't interested in talking about marriage and babies; I totally get that most men aren't mature enough to dive into that conversation on a first date; what I couldn't believe was how little he anguished over calling the date early. 

I didn't want to admit it to myself but over the last three years the dates had become less about forging a genuine connection and more about quick flings. Plenty of times I had enjoyed those flings and it was whatever; there was no spark so there was no need to stay in touch. But, like, the reading comprehension of these men! It didn't matter what I put in my bio; serious, want someday, looking for marriage; didn't they read what was clearly written there? I even ditched all the sexy pictures of myself and replaced them with pictures that gave off more of a wholesome, wife-y vibe, dress for the part you want sort of thing. Why weren't they getting it? 

I finally reached the tunnel which would eventually lead to the train station. The tunnel was something like an underpass. I didn't like taking it because there wasn't any exit from the tunnel except entering into it from either the end I was about to, or the end which came out at the station. I was so annoyed thinking about how the date went I didn't care if some creepy man was in the tunnel waiting for me. 

My heeled boots echoed with every step I took through the tunnel. It was a small tunnel, painted white all around except for the floor which was painted black. There was a metal railing which went all the way from one end of the tunnel to the other. It was much too cold for me to want to grip it and I bet it was dirty anyway. The tunnel was also well lit, with strong white lights dotted at intervals all the way along. Usually the tunnel had at least a few people coming and going in it but as I walked along it I noticed I was the only thing making any noise in the tunnel (not including the faint humming of the lights above). 

The first odd thing I noticed was that the breeze which eased through the tunnel had stopped. I was stooping over a little hugging myself for warmth trying to ignore the firm breeze; but then all of a sudden it stopped; which was weird. 

I kept moving forwards. 

*Clop-clop, clop-clop, clop-clop.* 

Should have gotten my driving license years ago, I thought. Back then there was always someone to drive me around. I thought my acting career was going to take off quickly so I had figured by the time I was famous I wouldn't even need a license because I would have a driver to take me places anyway. That was still the goal but outside of some university short films and commercials the acting work hadn't taken off yet. 

I wasn't sure when the scraping sound started. I was sure I noticed it after the sound of it had grown in volume steadily over several seconds. 

I came to a stop and looked over my shoulder. The tunnel from where I was at about a quarter of the way through it hadn't reached the bend, so it made no sense that I couldn't see light at the end of the tunnel from where I had started out. Instead all I could see was an orange wall completely taking up the inside of the tunnel. 

I giggled. It was such a silly thing to see. Obviously someone was playing a joke on me because it was the same wall I had seen in the middle of the road before. What made it even sillier was how the wall was perfectly curved around the top to fit just right with the tunnel ceiling. 

Oh, I thought, there were probably some pranksters, some internet guys, who had moved around a fake wall and thought it would be funny to get my reaction. I took out my phone to start recording the fake wall but noticed my phone was out of battery. Just my luck. I stuffed my phone back into my handbag and continued to look at the orange wall. 

The scraping sound had stopped when I turned around. But it started up again and I could see that the wall appeared to be the source of the scraping noise.The wall was moving steadily forward and the scraping sound was as if the brick of the wall were scraping against the concrete floor and walls of the tunnel. 

""Oh,"" I said, aloud. 

I noticed the metal railing on the right-hand side of the tunnel was upturned and coiling round. 

With a sudden metallic pop the railing came away from the wall from where one of the bolts gave way to the approaching wall. 

It looked so real. It was really as if the wall were getting closer to me at a slow walking pace and as it did the metal railing was being bent and ripped away from the tunnel-wall because it had no place else to go. 

""This is really elaborate,"" I said, forcing a smile. Surely the men with their cameras would reveal themselves at any moment. This clearly was some dumb internet prank, right? 

The approaching orange wall began to pick up speed. Both the scraping sound and the metallic bending noise increased significantly. I let out a scream at the sudden loudness and dropped my handbag in fright; the small hand mirror Cheryl gave me for my twenty-fifth birthday rolled on its side out of my handbag towards the wall. I watched it roll as I reached down to get the other items which had fallen out of my handbag. 

The approaching wall crushed the hand mirror in less than a second, the mirror cracking and breaking to pieces which slipped beneath the wall's lowest bricks. 

Despite this it still took me another second to realise how much danger I was in. The scraping and the twisting of the metal railing became almost unbearably loud; the wall continued its steady approach towards me and it seemed to be picking up speed. 

Holding tight to my handbag I turned and ran away at a jogging pace. The sound of scraping and twisting metal and the occasional loud bursting away of the bolts keeping the railing fastened to the tunnel wall continued behind me. 

Was the tunnel collapsing? Was there something behind the wall, like a car, which was accelerating and pushing it forward somehow? 

Within seconds I broke into as fast of a run as I could muster in my heeled boots. Part of me thought it was so stupid to be running from an orange wall that wasn't there when I first entered the tunnel, but whether it made sense stopped mattering. I needed to get away from the horrible noises and I had seen what the wall had done to my hand mirror.

I quickly found myself wishing I had used the treadmill at my local gym for more than just steep incline walking. A stitch came on hard as I neared what I imagined to be the halfway point of the tunnel. There was still the other half to go but the tunnel appeared to be gaining even more speed. I dared a look over my shoulder and saw the wall was swallowing up much of the twisted metal railing that was being torn away from the wall; it was as if the bottom-most part of the wall were a giant hoover at first grinding, then sucking up whatever touched it. 

What if I stopped running? What if I fell down and the wall plowed right over me? I let out a scream and quickly wished I hadn't because I was already so out of breath. 

*Clop! Clop! Clop! Clop!*

Please! I thought, Move faster! 

My body was pathetically slow. In my desperation I dropped my handbag. It was slowing me down and it just made sense in the moment to let it go. I moved faster thanks to the weight of my handbag not slowing me down but I couldn't help but look back and watch as the wall ground it to pieces in a mere moment. 

The wall was real; so real and moving fast and unrelenting towards me. I felt the urge to sob. I was so scared but I knew that letting myself cry could mean the death of me. I didn't have the precious seconds to spare. needed to run to the tunnel exit.

I wasn't going to make it. The wall was moving far too fast for me to outrun it. Maybe if I took my boots off I might be able to run full-tilt but the time it would take for me to slip them off the wall would surely reach me. No! Idiot! Just do it! Now or never! 

I stopped and hopped on the spot taking the first boot off, then the second. It was the fastest I had ever taken my boots off by a mile. I heard the awful sound of the wall sucking up and grinding down the boots a half-second later. I could feel the rush of air and the cold of the twisted metal railing against my hand for an instant. 

I think the wall would have crushed me then if not for the metal railing at that section bursting violently away from the tunnel wall. It struck me hard in the shoulder and pushed me forward. It hurt so much I was sure that a bone in my shoulder must have broken. I had no time to check but the push from the railing had given me a precious extra second to start sprinting. 

I had never ran in my whole life with such intensity. I could move so much better with my feet touching down on the cold tunnel floor. I sucked in breath after breath as if hyperventilating desperate to reach the end of the tunnel; I could make out the sound of the lights along the tunnel ceiling bursting and shattering and being sucked up by the wall along with the metal. 

I was almost out. Almost. I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. I was maybe a handful of seconds at my sprinting pace from reaching it. But there was something on the floor ahead of me in my way. My whole body wanted to scream because it had nothing more to give and the idea that there was some new obstacle preventing me from getting away from the chaos charging forward behind it was too much. 

There was a cat on the ground licking itself. 

""Move!"" I screamed at the top of my lungs. 

The ginger cat seemed to realise the danger it was in and darted off towards the end of the tunnel. I had no time to feel relief for the cat. Worse, screaming for it to move warning it of the danger it should already have heard coming (I suppose it confused the scraping for the usual sound of the train rumbling by), I had used up all of the air in my lungs. Every fiber of my body was telling me it couldn't move that little bit more because it had already reached beyond its limit. 

I reached the precipice of the tunnel catching a glimpse of the edge of the platform and a half dozen people waiting about. 

My body gave out. I simply couldn't move forward anymore no matter how desperately I wanted to. I felt the wall at my back; the solid brick like the cold touch of death. I was going to be crushed just like the metal railing and the tunnel lights and my mirror, handbag, and boots. 

The agony of the wall reminded me of the time I had been in a car crash. Just sheer force wracking my body and the pain climbing all at once to an unbearable degree. For a second I could do nothing but feel my entire body squeeze hard against the unyielding pressure of the wall and then, just as I began to descend towards the bottom of the wall where it would consume me by grinding me down. The pressure gave way and I found myself launching an athlete's leap from the end of the tunnel to the nearby wall where a poster for women's perfume resided. 

I hit the plastic frame casing at a sprinting speed. Pain erupted across my face, neck, and the rest of my body. The pain that was already in my shoulder was joined by even more pain, surely several broken bones, across the rest of my body. I was alive, but for how long? The wall was still coming. It was going to crush me. 

I slipped down with an almost cartoonish squeak, my blood coating the plastic frame in front of me; the blood was coming from my mouth and somewhere atop my head and elsewhere I couldn't be sure. I couldn't breathe. The impact had taken the air completely out of my lungs. I hit the ground and lay suffocating. I rolled over onto my back and saw the end  of the tunnel. 

The wall was gone, but the destruction it had caused remained. I lost consciousness as the people that had been waiting nearby raced towards me. The last thing I remember seeing was a cute guy looking down at me with concern on his face.",1,1727949937.0,Wholesomenosleep,0,1.0,False

I'm a local CC resident, and received this forwarded email from Melissa Chapman requesting donations to to help feed LEO and victims family during the trial. For those of you who aren't familiar with Ms Chapman, she is a CC probation officer and owner of Healthies, a smoothie/coffee shop across the street from the courthouse.

Is there any lawyers on here that would know if this violates any ethical rules? I myself don't think it's a great look.

Subject: Murder Trial Donation-Abby&Libby





Good Morning!

 

My name is Melissa Chapman, the Chief Probation Officer in Carroll County, Indiana. I also own a small business in our community. I have been authorized, as the small business owner, and a trusted member of the court, to take on the task of arranging the feeding of the family and law enforcement during the Richard Allen Murder trial of Abby & Libby. 

 

It is going to take a significant amount of money to feed 70 law enforcement officials and the 25 members of the family of the murdered girls every day for one month!  Feeding law enforcement and the family is not required; however, a crime of this magnitude is something that just does not happen in our small community. We are trying to wrap our support around the family and the law enforcement that have been working tirelessly for years to solve this crime. 

 

We are asking churches, nonprofits, and businesses to consider giving a sizable monetary donation to make this possible; however, any monetary donation is appreciated. If you are able to give a donation, please make the check payable to Melissa Chapman. If you prefer to pay the caterer directly we can arrange that too! Any unused money (the defendant pleads guilty, the trial takes less time, etc) will be donated to the Abby and Libby Park in Delphi, Indiana at the conclusion of the trial. 

 

Sincerely,

 

Melissa A. Chapman

i’m two days deep starting meds. 
taking 20mg in the morning. both mornings i’ve had a fresh brewed coffee(strong, suspect it might be part of the issue) 
during the day it is almost euphoric the difference in my ability to stay focused. 
now i have two issues, the main one is by the time i get home from work it’s obviously wearing off. but my thoughts go very fight or flighty. i’ve done some extensive work with shrinks the last year so thankfully i have the ability to identify it and snap out of it. things happening a very subtle like not wanting to look my partner in the eye cause my brain keeps telling me she’s suspicious i’ve been drinking( recovered alc) which i swear on my child’s life i have not done. basically think everyone has a hidden agender. i’ve also noticed the last two nights i’m forgetting small things- where i put my car keys or to let the dog back in. 
put detergent in the laundry sort of thing. then proceeding to beat myself up for a split second till i snap outta it. anyone who’s done recreational drugs would liken it to a very very mild come down. 
i’ve also had issues sleeping. and rambling on losing even the point of what i’m trying to say. 
the next issue is i keep all my vitamins and meds in my work truck in the door pocket. we had a hell of a lot of rain last night and as i was backing my trailer with the door open my bottle of ritalin fell out and went under the wheel in mud and water. i’ve been stressing about asking the pharmacist to replace them as it sounds way to convenient with a controlled med. at the time i had already had my pill for the day and i thought nothing of it but now all i can think is the pharmacist will think i’m selling them or abusing them. i know what a privilege it is to have access to these meds so i’m almost scared to wreck it. 
for context the pharmacist i know on a personal level and he knows i’ve enjoyed slash almost gone too far with coke. thanks london 😅 
we’ll if you have made it this far love to know your thoughts. mainly if these symptoms will cease and the guys won’t think i’m trying to pull a fast one🤦‍♂️ ",1,1727948828.0,adhdnz,0,1.0,False

I got out of my domestic abuse relationship a year ago on the 6th of this October. It does get better I know that, and it truly has. I am very grateful to be out of my past relationship. I was a teen mom and had my son a week after i graduated high school, 7 years ago. I wasn’t allowed to work, have friends or even have a relationship with my family. I dealt with a lot of emotional, physical and sexual abuse and I’m currently in my third year of therapy healing my
PTSD. 
I have been working as a barista for almost a year (October 12) and it did exactly what I needed it to do, and I am so greatful I even have a job, but I’ve been struggling with my mental health for the way men treat me. I am sexually harassed every shift, I’ve been pulled through the window and the man grabbed me and smelled my hair before letting me go, and I was even sexually assaulted by one of our delivery men. I have been looking for a new job since I started my current job and no one will hire me outside of another coffee stand, and I just can’t do it anymore. I make minimum wage, can’t afford my debt, and live with my parents in a tiny two bedroom home. My son and I share a bed. 
I’m very greatful and fortunate that we have a roof over our heads and food in our stomach but when and how will I get a better job. I pray everyday, I’ve tried “manifesting” by speaking it into existence. I tell myself everyday it’s a test of faith but I want to quit so bad but I can’t. I’ve put in so, so many job applications and have been constantly denied.

1fv3ozf,https://www.reddit.com/r/UKPersonalFinance/comments/1fv3ozf/do_i_have_budget_for_an_additional_entertainment/,Do I have budget for an additional entertainment expense?,"I’m self employed and I’m making around £35k this year. I try to be a frugal person but I used to be upper middle class back home and very new to having a low income. So, I struggle to make a healthy judgement on how much I can spend on what. 

Somehow I spend £400-450 on groceries per month. I am single, no kids. I shop at tesco and sainsburys. 

Transportation: around £150 per month (I cycle daily but I take the tube to work because otherwise it will be an additional 1.5 cycling everyday. I have a very tiring job already, just can’t cycle another 1,5 hours)

Accommodation: £150 (living with my partner. I pay the bills, he pays the rent. This is proportionate to our incomes as he makes a lot more than I do and luckily our rent is not that high)

Bills: £60 (wifi, phone, amazon, apple. I don’t have netflix, spotify or anything)

Gym £90 (I know there are cheaper options but this is pretty much only expense I do as a hobby. I don’t drink, don’t smoke, I don’t have any social life at all)

Take aways: £100-150 a month (probably need to cut the coffee shops 2-3 times a week £3-4 per coffee) 

Shopping £150-300 (like creams and supplements from holland and barrett, boots)

Storage unit: £160 (I sell stuff on ebay and about 10% of my income comes from those sales.)

I don’t have any debt. I have some savings that I’m hoping to use for buying a house in a year or two depending on how much mortgage I can get. 

I don’t know how much more I can cut and if I can actually afford an additional hobby that will cost me £150 per month. My income is likely to increase by 10% per year but if I can buy a house potentially a lot bigger increase is expected due to my job. I cut my own hair, do my own nails, I try and eat home made foods but healthy. 

Thanks for any advice!",1,1727947565.0,UKPersonalFinance,10,0.67,False

Then i try to search again and i have 15 minute penalty, because of someone else dodging a game?

How come they wont implement something to prevent this, for example when someone dodges the system recognize that and wont give penalty if you miss that ready check. Such a bad change.",0,1727947475.0,leagueoflegends,8,0.5,False

**Nuisance complaint**
Construction is beginning roughly around 6am, and there are loud bangs waking us up each morning. This morning, there was a series of bangs that scared me awake from my sleep. Deep ‘bangs’ like something metal was being struck. This has been going on all week. 

Construction vehicles are also going down the street very fast. 

I don’t like to complain, but I was nearly hit this morning from a speeding 18 wheeler.

So, as the subject says, I feel like I'm stuck with no idea how to move forward. I'm basically desperate for suggestions on something I could do at this point.

For starters, later this month will be a full year that I've been unemployed. I've probably sent out thousands of applications, gotten a couple interviews, but also had plenty of places ghost me after expressing some initial interest, and even staffing agencies ghosting me. I'll set up a time for them to call me about some job, and they never do. My last job was a total nightmare to add icing to this particular cake. There was the usual affair of being expected to do the work of 2-3 people and being actively prevented from doing what you were hired to do, but there was also the extremely toxic environment. My boss would talk shit about literally anyone and everyone. For some reason he had it out for a couple of people in another department. I was also walking by someone's desk on my way to the bathroom one day and heard them just casually discussing firing someone. Almost immediately after starting the job I started suffering serious nerve pain in my arm, but they wouldn't do anything about it. Then, when I wanted to start working remote, as I was promised the job would be when I interviewed, they fired me. Considering I was basically an incandescent ball of rage from stress the entire time I worked there, it was sort of a relief to be fired, but it also meant no income.

My unemployment ran out looong ago and I've basically been living on savings since then, but those are starting to get low. I live cheap, which helps, but with literally zero income it doesn't matter how cheap it is, it's still negative income.

I could become a middle aged loser who goes back to live with their parents, but thanks to losing the genetics lottery I have two hereditary conditions. They can be managed, but they require regular checkins with a doctor and expensive medications. Since I'm unemployed I am dependent upon the state's medicaid program to help me with this. My parents live in a state that has gone all in on the culture war bullshit and isn't the same friendly, if right of center, place I grew up anymore. So I'm not even sure if I could get on the medicaid rolls there if I were to move back, and I'd probably struggle to find anyone who could help manage my particular conditions. My parents are both retired now, so they can't really afford to support me in any meaningful way.

On top of that, I developed a case of frozen shoulder, limiting my range of motion in one arm by maybe 20% and lifting anything more than maybe 5lbs is extremely painful. This means I'm going to be limited even on potential part-time jobs I could get for the holiday season. Since my previous primary care doctor retired, the only doctor taking new medicaid patients didn't have an open slot until later this month, so I won't really be able to assess possible treatment options until then.

I've always had a bit of a social anxiety/phobia. Call it shyness, social anxiety, or whatever you want, basically until I feel comfortable with you, I have difficulties even carrying on a basic conversation. So, I don't really have any close friends. I had one, we were friends for 20-years after meeting in college, but roughly 4-years ago they killed themselves. Still feels like no more than 4-months since I was speaking at their funeral and watching their casket be loaded into the cremation furnace. Then feeling like a complete ass because I couldn't think of anything to say to their spouse. I've already made whatever peace I'm going to with my friend's death. 

My shyness/social anxiety also means I don't really do well with your basic talk therapy, not that it's easy to find anyone who will accept medicaid because it pays absolute shit. For a time I was going to a support group for people with depression, but it doesn't seem to have ever really recovered after Covid. Not to mention I don't really have money to pay for the gas to drive to meetings, and I live with several other people, so any kind of phone/video chat style meetings wouldn't really work either.

I also happen to have a really pale complexion, so I've never been one who can be out in the sun for very long without risking getting burned. Now I'm taking a medication that makes that risk even greater, so I can't really go outside for any extended period of time until around 6pm. With the days getting shorter, the sun is usually completely set by 8pm. So I have like maybe 2 hours I could go outside and take a walk or something, and sometimes I do, but it's hard to work up the motivation to do that these days. Adding skin cancer to my list of problems isn't something I'm keen on doing.

So these days my life is literally just get up, watch TV, play video games, apply for jobs, go to bed. Every. Single. Day. I have literally nothing to do, nowhere to go, no friends, no significant other, and no money to really do anything anyway. I'm literally so bored I make all my doctor appointments in person just so I have something to do for an hour or two every couple of months. Sitting in a waiting room or exam room is at least a change of scenery. I've even thought about going and literally volunteering for jury duty, but one of the other medications I'm taking makes me thirsty all day long, and that in turn means I'm peeing like every hour-hour and a half. 

Which all brings me back to you, person who actually read all that. I have no idea what I can do to get my life unstuck, and so am seeking your suggestion(s). Not expecting some miracle solution that will fix everything, though bonus points for anyone who can offer one. Just anything, however small, that can help move me out of this rut I find myself in would be welcome. ",2,1727947420.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

James had always prided himself on his sharp memory and keen focus, especially in his high-demand job as a financial analyst. But as time passed, he started to notice subtle changes. He would forget small details during important meetings or struggle to maintain focus during long conference calls. He brushed it off initially, chalking it up to stress or a busy lifestyle, but deep down, it began to worry him.

James, like many others, was in a position where his mental clarity directly impacted his career and day-to-day life. His frustration grew as he watched his colleagues breeze through complex tasks while he struggled with what once came easily. Seeking a solution, James started searching for ways to regain the mental sharpness that once defined him.

One evening, after reading numerous articles online about brain health, James came across something called Nero Thrive, a cognitive enhancement supplement that promised to support brain function, enhance memory, and promote mental clarity. Intrigued by the reviews, he decided to dig deeper. What stood out to him was Nero Thrive’s reliance on natural ingredients—unlike other supplements he’d encountered, this one seemed focused on long-term brain health without relying on caffeine or other stimulants. It appeared to be exactly what he needed.

[Nero Thrive](https://preview.redd.it/76kinwi4eisd1.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=d066564b5bebf16fdb35f6f7017277c6e473476d)

The more James researched, the more he was impressed by the science behind Nero Thrive. He learned that its formula was backed by years of neuroscience research. The ingredients included well-studied compounds like Bacopa Monnieri, which is known for boosting memory and reducing anxiety, and Ginkgo Biloba, which improves blood flow to the brain and helps prevent cognitive decline. These weren’t just trendy ingredients; they had been used for centuries in traditional medicine to support brain health.

As James read about the experiences of others who had tried Nero Thrive, he came across a testimonial from a woman named Sarah, who had a similar story. Sarah, a mother of two and a small business owner, had started feeling the same cognitive fog James was experiencing. After using Nero Thrive for several weeks, she noticed a remarkable difference in her ability to focus and retain information. ""It's like I’ve gotten back the mental edge I had in my twenties,"" Sarah said. That was all James needed to hear—he was convinced.

So, James ordered his first bottle of Nero Thrive. The instructions were straightforward—take one capsule a day, preferably in the morning. James started taking the supplement each day with his morning coffee, hoping for the best but managing his expectations. After all, he knew that brain health supplements often took time to show results.

In the first week, James didn’t notice much of a change, but by the third week, he began to feel different. His focus during meetings improved. He no longer struggled to find the right words or remember crucial details. Tasks that once felt overwhelming now seemed manageable again. Even more surprising, he felt more mentally alert throughout the entire day, not just in the morning when he was most energized.

One of the most remarkable changes for James was how Nero Thrive improved his memory. As part of his job, he had to analyze large sets of financial data, and prior to taking the supplement, he’d often find himself losing track of important numbers or having to recheck his work multiple times. But with Nero Thrive, he was able to recall information faster, and his overall productivity increased. It wasn’t just about the immediate effects—James felt like his brain was getting healthier over time.

What James appreciated most about Nero Thrive was that it didn’t give him that jittery feeling he’d experienced with other cognitive enhancers, which often relied on high doses of caffeine. Instead, Nero Thrive’s ingredients, like L-Theanine, provided a calm focus that allowed him to stay alert without the crash. He also found comfort in knowing that the supplement supported long-term brain health—something he realized was becoming more important as he got older.

Months passed, and James felt like a new person. He wasn’t just surviving his hectic work life anymore; he was thriving. He began recommending Nero Thrive to his friends and colleagues, especially those who had shared their struggles with focus and memory. While he knew it wasn’t a magic pill, it had certainly made a significant impact on his life.

James’s story is one of many. In a world where mental performance can make or break success, supplements like Nero Thrive offer a natural, science-backed way to support brain function and cognitive health. For James, it wasn’t just about improving memory or focus for the short term—it was about investing in his brain’s longevity, ensuring that he could keep excelling in his career and personal life for years to come.

The lesson James learned, and one that he shared with anyone who would listen, was that brain health deserves just as much attention as physical health. Supplements like Nero Thrive aren’t just for those experiencing cognitive decline—they’re for anyone who wants to keep their mind sharp and stay ahead in an increasingly competitive world. **Visit for more info about Neuro-Thrive Brain Support -** [**https://neuro-thrive.com/**](https://freezegluco.com/Neuro-Thrive.html)

And just like James, anyone can take steps toward unlocking their full mental potential, whether it’s through better nutrition, lifestyle changes, or supplements like Nero Thrive. After all, the brain is our most powerful tool—why not give it the support it deserves?",3,1727947296.0,healthysupplement_,2,1.0,False

This is going to be the first date I’ve gone on in two years.

I've been dealing with some psychological issues lately. Could use some help. As digital nomads we often work with sensitive info (invoices, VAT, passwords, bank accounts etc).

For like the past month, i've been going through this negative loop of putting off doing very important things because I am overly self conscious whenever I work outside in coffee shops coworking places etc.

it's this negative loop of getting up - leaving the house right away after the morning routine - looking for a coffee shop - being overly CRIPPLED by paranoid thoughts: who's looking at my screen, am I allowed to make public calls here, what are these people going to think about me looking this up.

It's not so much about working stuff. My question is more this: **how much personal stuff are you doing out in the public? things like making calls to real estate agents, checking bank accounts, looking for places to stay on airbnb** things of that nature. These are things I NEED to do but never end up doing because I can't stand being at home to do those things anymore. It's like my brain does not function at home when I work on these things.

This might be honestly a stupid ass post but i'm really struggling here really. I've been stranded in a city for 5 days now because I can't get myself to book my next airbnb. Overthinking to the max. Has anyone else had this problem before? I'm just tired of being stuck at home all the time, because I know i'm missing opportunities to meet people globally (which is the whole point of this journey as a digital nomad) but for some reason i'm just always self conscious all the time. Maybe it's just me being in a foreign country and standing out so much. ",0,1727947128.0,digitalnomad,3,0.5,False

I (30M) have been in a relationship with my gf (26F) for about a year. We moved in together about 3 months into the relationship. She is studying and doing some part time work on the side, making about 700-1100 monthly. I have a very good career and make about 10x what she does and have been paying for everything thus far: rent, utilities, car (which she sometimes uses), food (we mostly eat takeaway), vacations, dates, etc. She sometimes pitches in for a coffee or buys some groceries, but rarely. We clean up together, I do my own laundry, she sometimes does it for me too. I get a maid in once in a while to clean up, which I pay for too.

I have been feeling that this isn't a fair way to split responsibilities. 5 months ago I asked her to put more effort in, by either pitching in some amount (200-300 USD, when rent + utilities is 1400) or by taking on the responsibility of keeping the house clean (either doing it herself or paying for a maid). She said she doesn't want to be my 'servant', which felt really off, because what am I then - a wallet? It really isn't about the financials here as I can fully pay for everything and have a bunch leftover, I just feel like we aren't putting in an equal amount of effort into our household and day to day. 

She does clean the house now, except the room where I work, but constantly complains that she has to do it. She doesn't do it really well either and the house ends up being quite disorganized after, I try to gently suggest alternative ways of organizing things, but she doesn't really take criticism well. At one point I just took it upon myself to fully reorganize the apartment, throw out old boxes, useless garbage and labelled where we should put things. I feel bad about it and honestly makes it feel like I'm 'forcing' her to do this and we keep coming back to the same argument, with her saying I make enough to pay for a maid so why not do it. Sometimes I order a maid in again to just help her.

I am seriously considering breaking up with her, as it feels like I'm putting in a lot, with very little gratitude and reciprocity. I get that she is currently quite busy with university and part time work, but I feel exhausted and used. AITAH for asking to split responsibilities in this way?

1fv3kfz,https://www.reddit.com/r/OzempicForWeightLoss/comments/1fv3kfz/java_burn_review_a_unique_approach_to_weight_loss/,Java Burn Review: A Unique Approach to Weight Loss,"**Introduction to Java Burn** Java Burn is a dietary supplement designed to help users lose weight by enhancing their metabolism. Marketed as an additive to be mixed with coffee, it claims to optimise the body's fat-burning processes and provide sustained energy throughout the day. Unlike typical weight loss supplements, Java Burn's combination with coffee is what sets it apart, promising increased metabolic function without altering your daily routine.

**How It Works** The main appeal of Java Burn lies in its formulation. It's advertised as an odourless, tasteless powder that you mix into your morning coffee. It works by boosting your metabolism, primarily thanks to its natural ingredients like green tea extract, L-carnitine, and chromium. These components are known for their ability to accelerate fat burning, reduce appetite, and help regulate blood sugar levels. Java Burn capitalises on the synergy between caffeine and its active ingredients, with caffeine acting as a stimulant to further boost your metabolic rate.

**My Experience with Java Burn** Having tried various weight loss supplements before, I was intrigued by Java Burn’s unique delivery system. Mixing it with my morning coffee felt seamless, and I appreciated that it didn’t alter the taste or texture of my drink. Over the course of several weeks, I noticed a subtle yet consistent increase in energy levels. I didn’t experience the jittery side effects that some weight loss products can cause, likely because the stimulant effect of caffeine was balanced by the natural ingredients in Java Burn.

While I did experience a noticeable uptick in energy and a moderate reduction in appetite, the weight loss results were gradual. This product isn’t a quick fix, but more of a supplementary aid. I lost a few pounds over the course of a month, but I believe the results would be more significant with consistent use and a healthy diet.

**Ingredients and Benefits** One of the key benefits of Java Burn is its natural formulation. The green tea extract is rich in antioxidants, which help detoxify the body while also aiding in fat oxidation. L-carnitine helps in converting fat into energy, making workouts more efficient and burning calories throughout the day. Chromium, a lesser-known ingredient, plays a crucial role in regulating blood sugar levels, which can help reduce cravings and prevent insulin spikes.

The fact that Java Burn doesn’t rely on synthetic ingredients or harsh chemicals is a major plus. The ingredients work together in synergy, not just to promote weight loss but to improve overall metabolic health.

**Any Drawbacks?** Although I had a generally positive experience with Java Burn, there are a few drawbacks. First, the product works best when combined with a regular exercise routine and a balanced diet. It’s not a miracle cure that will work in isolation. Additionally, while Java Burn is tasteless when mixed into coffee, it may not be ideal for those who are not regular coffee drinkers. The caffeine boost, while effective, may be too stimulating for those sensitive to it.

**Conclusion** Overall, Java Burn offers a promising approach to weight loss for coffee lovers looking for an easy way to enhance their metabolism. It’s a natural, easy-to-use product that fits seamlessly into a daily routine. While it may not produce dramatic results overnight, it has the potential to support gradual weight loss, particularly when paired with healthy habits. If you’re looking for a metabolism booster that doesn’t require major lifestyle changes, Java Burn could be worth considering.",0,1727946964.0,OzempicForWeightLoss,0,0.33,False

1fv3ian,https://www.reddit.com/r/Sinusitis/comments/1fv3ian/sinusitis_symptoms_or_an_unrelated_condition/,Sinusitis symptoms or an unrelated condition,"After debilitating headaches, insufferable lightheadedness and overall misery for over a month, I have scheduled an appointment with an ENT doctor and will hopefully get a CT scan.

What I know so far: I have been infected with RSV (shown by antigen test), I have a deviated nasal septum, I have turbinate hypertrophy, and a sinus X-ray has shown ""minimal"" opacification, but the image is not clear enough and a CT scan has been recommended.

While waiting, I was wondering if my symptoms are consistent with sinusitis (I am hesitating between sinusitis, POTS and a CSF leak and my medical team is undecided):

1. Obvious signs:

* continuous nasal drip, but only right-sided; intensified by steam inhalations
* strong gurgling sounds in nasal passages during steam inhalation
* crackling sounds inside head, not from neck crepitus but from higher up, as if my sinuses were cramping and mucus was flowing between different regions, with bubbles popping in it; sometimes I can distinctly feel it at the base of my right nostril
* fullness in my ears (or Eustachian tubes), with some popping; sensation relieved by inserting a finger in my ear and pulling it out after creating a vacuum
* general malaise and misery, of the kind felt during a cold or the flu

2. Less obvious signs:

* when I stand up, and less so when I sit up, it feels like my brain is being squeezed like a sponge, or alternatively that it is filled with a heavy metal, with different areas being affected at different times, sometimes in succession, with each area being affected for seconds at a time, probably depending on which side I tilt my head towards; sometimes I feel such a strong surge of pain in some area that I am compelled to lie down, especially in my right occipital region, with a sensation of blood or some other fluid rushing to the area (this happened to me while I was alternately lifting and lowering a shopping basket); I also feel pressure above my nose bridge, around my eyes and in my temples
* lying down provides immediate relief and I always feel better after sleeping
* in addition to the pain and pressure affecting larger areas, there are points between my vertex where I feel sharp jolts of pain
* if I squeeze my head (e.g. a few days ago I stuffed it between the headrest and the backrest of a car seat), strong pressure pain remains after the squeezing stops; I even feel this when I rub my head with a towel after washing my hair
* sometimes the headache seems to have a coat hanger quality and it feels that my neck can barely hold my head; it even feels like my head is shaking on my neck; a few days ago, I even had to suddenly kneel down while showering because I felt surges of burning pain above my nose and when I got up, I could only finish the shower with my head rested on the wall; in hospital waiting rooms where I can't sit, I also find that I have to hold my head in my hands
* headache worsened further by bending over, such that even straightening my head while already upright can exacerbate my condition; yesterday I started feeling horrible brain surges just because I bent my head forward while kneeling on my bed in a yoga position
* headache worsened by drinking coffee and smoking
* headache extremely worsened by Valsalva maneuver and basically any straining (e.g. while using the bathroom)
* orthostatic lightheadedness/brain fog (as if my senses were struggling to work, without any cognitive impairment, and without vertigo
* difficulty breathing (possible explanation: my nasal passages are perhaps so narrow that I cannot inhale through them; the X-ray also indicated narrow nasal passages; I do not really feel this when breathing through both nostrils, but when I close one and breathe only through the other, it feels like I am struggling to suck in air through some fully closed sphincter)
* bounding pulse (even when lying down, I can feel my head jump on the pillow with each contraction)
* nausea (without vomiting), especially in the morning and while eating (newest symptom, since a few days ago)

3. Problems

* I last had colored mucus (yellow and green) on the 13th of September; now my mucus is clear, though a bit thick
* My bloodwork is improving (I'm taking all sorts of vitamins and minerals) as my symptoms are worsening; I don't have any sign of an infection (e.g. elevated leukocytes or lymphocytes)
* I don't have a fever (36.2 yesterday)
* I don't have a runny nose
* I don't have a sore throat (despite the continuous post-nasal drip)
* I don't have a cough
* Antibiotics produce no effect (finished a round of amoxicillin and have now started a round of clarithromycin)
* Decongestants alleviate any congestion I feel at my nose bridge but do nothing for the rest of my symptoms
* My headache does not respond to metamizole, paracetamol or ibuprofen

This is the real deal, the crème de la crème of local business tools. And with the power of AI baked right in, it's like having a digital marketing genius working for you 24/7.

Keywords, schmeywords. This AI digs deep into local search trends, helping you optimize your profile for the exact terms your potential customers are using. It's like having a crystal ball that shows you exactly what people are searching for – and how to get in front of them.

# Who Needs This? (Spoiler: You Do)

Now, you might be wondering, ""Is this really for me?"" Let me break it down for you:

* **Small Business Owners**: If you're running a local shop, restaurant, or service business, this is your ticket to standing out in a crowded market.

# Real-World Results: My Beta Tester Experience

Now, I wouldn't be singing the praises of this tool if I hadn't put it through its paces myself. As a beta tester, I had the chance to try out Google Business Profile with AI on my own local business – a cozy little coffee shop in downtown.

Before implementing this tool, my shop was just another face in the crowd. We had decent foot traffic, but nothing to write home about. Enter Google Business Profile with AI.

Within the first month of using the tool, I saw a 37% increase in profile views. The AI suggested adding specific keywords to my business description that I never would have thought of – turns out, people in my area were searching for ""ethically sourced coffee"" and ""gluten-free pastries."" Who knew?

The review management feature was a game-changer. I used to dread responding to reviews, but the AI-generated templates made it a breeze. My response rate went up to 100%, and I started seeing an uptick in positive reviews.

But here's the kicker – after three months of using the tool, my in-store foot traffic increased by 22%. That translated to a 15% boost in revenue. And the best part? I was spending less time managing my online presence and more time perfecting my latte art.

It was so good that I did the same in August and went other Mediterranean island. 

Now I am back in UK weather is crap. Already thinking if I can get away with Canary islands?

A bit surprised that I got away with it so far but worried that my wife will start questioning why are all the marketing conferences in holiday locations 😀 lolz. She got very limited awareness of finances as I am sole income earner.   Also use credit card to creativity manage cash flows. 

Why am I doing it and what's the problem? 

It all started because i believed that I need a break and she is always got issues with her  mental health that's why she is not working though things are getting better. Also when I travel alone I can do it super cheap like hostels or sleeping ina tent. If I need to take her I could not afford as many holidays. Also I noticed I enjoyed it more alone. I am fast paced so I noticed that If I got alone I get to see/do 2 or 3 times as many things as together. With her everything needs to be planned with toilets and food breaks. And she will  take like 20 minutes in a toilet. Like wtf. No cheating or funny business just mostly outdoors hiking.

What should I do ?

Now I don't wanna leave her because she is smart so conversations with her are kind of good. Still enjoy coffee with her and some dates here and there. Also s.... is pretty good lolz and she is attractive. Finally she fully realies on me financially doesn't have family to go to so I feel solely reposibile for her.
Also I am pretty sure I would regret is if I went all by myself. 


About me.

 Self criticism: I am narrsisct self induldged little duck who can't make up his mind and who wants eat cake and have cake. 

Self defence:

I feel like I wasted my late twenties because I had to take care of her with single junior salary. Now that I get paid more I want to enjoy life more. Also Covid made me realised how short life is and I want enjoy life before next s... hits the fan.

Any advice of what to do?

TL;DR

Asking on advice what to do. I started to enjoy solo travel while not being honest about it to my wife. Now I am thinking about doing it again. Though there are issues like me being single income provider I acknowledge it's  morally dodgy . ",0,1727945363.0,relationships,25,0.18,False

1fv372p,https://www.reddit.com/r/HistamineIntolerance/comments/1fv372p/sunlight_probably_helps_you_heal_quicker/,Sunlight probably helps you heal (quicker),"I have gut issues + histamine intolerance for more than a decade now. Like many of you I have been through the usual path: 1st noticing the link between your digestive issues and your neurological issues, sleep, nose/ears issues, chronic fatigue, etc. Then you learn about leaky gut, start learning nutrition and start testing diets. Diets with an s because wow we've all been through so many diets (low fodmap, low carbs/keto, veg, low histamine, etc.). That process takes years before you start knowing what you can eat and what you cannot. Some of us still don't know about gluten after years: is it the histamine from the yeast in bread? Is it the mozza/dairy on homemade quality pizzas? Is it the sugar we usually eat along with bread (marmelade, etc.)? Is gliadin really making my gut even leakier releasing zonulin? etc. In the end, like lots of people on reddit, I can have a diet around black rice, carrots, onion squash (and -likes) fresh chicken and... well, not much more, some complements for calcium, etc..

Then there is always that restaurant or dinner at friends when you feel good and see that chocolate cake or slice of pizza, and you tell yourself ""juste for once"", and you notice you don't feel that shitty the next day so you start thinking you're almost healed, maybe you can drink a small cup of coffee and see if you still feel good!... and well, a few days later you're back to your shitty life. Kind of a loop... and trust me I am very far away from processed food, every time I fail is because I felt I could drink a high quality self-grinded cup of coffee for once or take a single dessert in a fancy restaurant. But you know, those things are loading with sugar or histamine.

I'm telling this because I just want you to know I have many years trying/testing things.

But what I hadn't tried that past decade is... spending time outside. I'm writing this here because I suspect we - reddit people - do spend a lot of time in front of computers/screens, because most of us are working in offices, or homeworking and have hobbies around a screen. Provided that you are single and live a in big city with friends living far away, well, you probably spend your life indoors. Worst? if you always feel tired/bad, it's even more likely there are days you don't even go outside.

Also, gut issues, food intolerance, testosterone issues etc. seem to rise along with the arrival of internet and the smartphone. I know there may be A LOT of bias on this one, there are for sure, but it may be interesting to consider as a possibility to explore new paths.

Recently, I started to notice I was healing a lot quicker (meaning I could eat forbidden food with far less impact) when I was on holidays in the mountain. To me it wasn't stress related because I also spent holidays at my parents (mostly indoors) and still felt bad, so it was more about the mountain holidays, those ones when you spend your day hiking or visiting small towns.

Of course I already had tried to do sport on a daily basis: indoors on my rower, bike on Zwift, etc. and it didn't help, on the contrary it made my leaky gut even worse, because endurance sports tend to cut blood flow in the gut and you reach 70% of you VO2max and above for 20min and more. I was also spending some time on the bike outdoors, for about 2 hours, but as I was performing at my best possible capacity, in the end I was feeling very bad right after and for almost 24 hours as my body was full of toxins, lactates etc. + my gut was short in blood triggering digestive issues, worsening the leaky gut.

So, here we are (finally, I know it's a lot to read).

The recipe was kind of ""low effort, daily outdoor activity"".

So I started to look for possible explanations.

To make it short: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905393/](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5905393/)

I have read many, many studies like this one but I guess this one sums it up pretty well. Other studies focus more on the immunological impact, anti-inflammatory ones to be more precise. And as you know, immunity and inflammatory response is leading our gut issues.

Humans were not spending their life indoors behind UV blocking windows (all glasses block UVB radiation) or in cars with the same UVB blocking properties. Humans were not working from morning to evening in offices and were outside most of their time. At least in cities, I notice no one (at least single people) ever go outside except to go shopping or get some food. Walking 5min from the bus station to the office isn't ""spending some time outside"". Of course, UV radiation during the summer can be dangerous, but low grade UV radiation during other seasons is beneficial and NEEDED for a normal/good body function! This not just about vitamin D, it's about LOTS of other things and immunity regulation is one of them.

You understood me: I suspect living indoors for years has something to do with our IBS. Knowing this may help to reverse.",7,1727945178.0,HistamineIntolerance,6,1.0,False

Need a lil help/tips/experiences from yall to word this properly and correctly and in a non-creepy way.
I met some girl from a different school in a tournament, i immediately started to like her and spent a lot of time with their team cuz they were cooler, spent more time watching the games and chit chatting with their members than my own team lol.
I got an opportunity to join one of their events and I’m planning to ask her out, i think she might be a lil bit older than me (half a year) i think. I complimented her name when i first heard it and she also memorized my name very quickly because on the second day she said yay its *my name* he is back. I wouldn’t think of that as a signal tho.
So when i join them for this event all their team will be there, i can ask her out on a nice coffee date by sayin something like “hey you seem really sweet, would you be down to grab a coffee? So we can chit chat and get to know each other” 
But im afraid when and where to say it, maybe after the event when its a lil bit more private in the parking lot right before separating our ways? Or would that be weird?
Keep in mind that i don’t know her that well and neither does she know me aside from that one weekend attending the same tournament and thats why i wanna go out. ",1,1727945166.0,dating_advice,2,1.0,False

My paternal aunt is celebrating her wedding after 30 years of being with my uncle. They both live in Spain, i live in Germany. I agreed to going, was even looking forward to it.

  
Now some things have changed in the last month. I had a really big argument with my father and my stepmom after my birthday. On the surface of the argument is the fact that i wanted my birthday party to be completely vegan, and the paternal side of my family disagreed with that and found it controlling. It ended in quite the catastrophic party with me being away for 45 mins, crying and hyperventilating. I'm aware that wasn't a very mature reaction, and have apologized, especially to my grandparents, who were also present. There was coffee and water, and cake, but they reproached me for also not offering alcoholic beverages, because my grandfather likes to drink beer. One of the reasons why I reacted so strongly is because the paternal side of my family have many times ridiculed me for my way of eating, I literally never say a thing, I'm just there minding my own business, I just thought it would be ok to not serve animal produts for one meal. Another reason is that my relationship to that side of my family is very difficult, has been since my childhood. My parents are divorced, I have seen this side of my family way less than my maternal family, and when I was with them I never fully felt safe as a child. Not physically, but they have a emotionally cold and intimidating streak to them. -Whenever I was with them, I always felt like I'm not quite right the way I am. In comparison to that, my mum and grandma are very warmhearted and loving people towards me. So underneath the whole birthday debacle are bigger issues, that have been festering my hole life, but never openly addressed. My stepmom came up into the kitchen when i was crying and told me that in the future ""no one will want to come to my parties"". They didn't really ask what the problem was and when I came back down it was just all very uncomfortable. So i fully take credit for being an asshole for letting my family sit there without me, and being a bad host that day.

  
Forward a few weeks, and I have now had two conflict talks with my dad and my stepmother. It was about the birthday, but also about generally telling me that I am a person that doesnt have enough respect for others. My dad was very...decisive in his delivery of this, and i felt gaslit a few times, and also i thought, ""wow, this man is more arrogant than i thougt"", a few times during the conversation. I told him that i feel he could be more sensivitive and caring sometimes. In the end, even though we didnt see eye to eye, we kinda reconciled because we both said that we care for each other and that our critique reached the other person at least to some extent. 

  
With my stepmom the situation unfolded quite differently. She had the same talking points as my father, but I just got a general feeling of her not liking me that much. I have known this woman for almost 30 years. She also told me i had no respect, when i asked for an example, she said i didnt get a chair for my grandma when we went for dinner once 8 years ago. I said that i dont understand, that i feel like i am caring, and kind when im with them, she then said that she can see through my fassade and i can stop trying to be somehting i'm not. We talked about the birthday, i told her she hurt me by saying no one would ever come to a party of mine again, she (also my father) not once acknowleged any part of theirs in the difficulties of our relationsship, now or in the past. She said she doesnt have a problem with me, I'm the one having the problem. She said my veganism is immature and she has a more mature way of seeing the world. That she is 30 years my senior and therefore we are only equals to a certain degree. The conversation then stirred in a more forgiving direction, i told her about my relationsship to my parents, and how i always idealized my dad and kinda put my mum down, i had to correct that in therapy, seeing my mum as the strong and loving woman that brought me up mostly on her own, and my dad just being quite absent, and also, and thats difficult to admit to myself, also flawed like every human being. She then said that we have to talk about the birthday AGAIN and that she is going to tell me the facts because she sees the truth and i dont. It escalated then, when i wanted to leave, because i didnt feel emotionally safe anymore and it didnt feel like constructive criticism at all. She then said in a mocking voice: "" ooooohh you poor victim, running away again. you arent even able to stand your ground!"" (we had been talking for at least 1,5 hours then). Then she calles me a know-it-all and kicked me out of the house. We havent had contact since.

  
Now there will be the marriage of my aunt in a few weeks, like I mentioned above. My whole paternal family will be there. Its on the Canary islands. I actually dont have the money to go. If I want to go it will put me into dept. No adding to this is the fact that of course i would see my stepmom there, and my father already said that she and i would have to pretend that everything is okay, to not disturb the party. Im not sure if i know how to do that. I feel like this woman despises me, and i would like to not have to see her everyday of my vacation (we are all int he same hotel), that i dont even have the money to go on. One part of me would like to just break with this side of my family, because of the old hurt i feel inside, not feeling loved the way i am. Im sure they are right about some aspects about their critique, i am an only child and i think i can act a bit spoiled and self centered sometimes. But apart from that im also loving, and caring, and have a big heart for animals and for people. I work as a medical psychotherapist and am almost done with my training. I would say i have a kind, albeit faulted, personality. I just didnt feel seen that way.

I look after my mum (89). She has lived with us (my husband and I) since 2016. Over the years I have taken on all the food prep as mum has mobility issues and can’t stand long enough to make food anymore. She needs to lose about a stone in weight (14lbs) as her knees and back are giving pain. We were at her doctors yesterday where this was confirmed. Apart from weight, her health issues are scoliosis and a slightly high cholesterol (which she is on tablets for). Her blood sugar is fine. She walks with sticks (inside) and a wheeled mobility device outside (she pushes it). 

She is 5’ (used to be 5’4”) and weighs 13 stone (182lbs or 82.5kg). Her food, we think, is pared back to the bare minimum. I put her daily food through one of those online calorie counters and it’s about 1400 to 1600 daily. A typical days food is; breakfast of banana, handful of blueberries, 3 heaped dessert spoons of vanilla Greek yoghurt, some chia seeds and a sprinkle of granola, with a cup of lemon tea and a sweetener; lunch is a brown bread turkey and cucumber sandwich with 5 cherry tomatoes and a pro biotic drink; mid afternoon she’ll have a cup of coffee and a small orange; dinner is whatever I cook, e.g. chicken thighs with veg and gravy (she won’t eat potatoes/rice apart from once a week).

I personally think there is too much sugar in her diet, but she won’t budge on the breakfast (I’ve tried loads of different things) and the rest of her food isn’t that sugary I don’t think.

She won’t exercise (very hard for her to move, we tried chair yoga and she was in pain through most of what she tried, walking is exhausting and she feels unsafe on her feet a lot of the time). I am at a loss over how to help here. Any suggestions on what we can do?

It’s really sad, as long as I’ve been aware, mum has been ‘on a diet’ and I hate seeing her still so caught up in this mind set. (She’s always been on the large size, I have no recollection of her being less than a UK size14, and she’s mainly been about an 18). No one else in the immediate family is overweight (oh, my female cousin is, she’s mums brothers daughter, but she is the only one).

I drink a lot of coffee on a daily basis and probably more alcohol per week than I should. I appreciate that both of these things are detrimental to both sleep and recovery, but I wondered if Bevel does or plans to take into account the quantities and times of intake (both of which are recorded by the excellent journaling section).

For example, I know that a couple of glasses of wine of an evening is going to upset my sleep, it's common sense and it is also clear from my insights that alcohol is a massive negative, especially on recovery. But it would be useful to know how, say, a couple of beers at lunch would affect me vs. a couple of glasses of wine over dinner vs. an evening out at the pub with the boys. I know the answer, of course, but I like to see the data.

Similarly caffeine, I average about 320mg per day (data from the last six months) assuming 95mg per cup of coffee, which may or may not be accurate. It's not uniform; at work I tend to have many cups per day while at weekends I have less, but I am conscious that since starting to track in Bevel I have managed exactly zero days without caffeine!! I've recently started having decaf at least in the afternoon, and aiming to cut down to one cup of caffeinated coffee in the morning. Again it would be useful to see how this difference in time and quantity affects things.

Credit to Bevel and Apple Health for getting me to even think about these things. I know and have always known these things are bad for me, but there's nothing like clear data written in front of you to get you to make a change right?!",2,1727944443.0,bevelhealth,1,1.0,False

Brewing time:6 weeks - primary 7-10 days / bottle condition 2 weeks

Am I supposed to be rumming a 3 week secondary fermentation on it? The instructions have one section of specifics (brewing time, expected gravity, mash temp etc) but the majority of it is generic instructions that could be applicable to almost any brew. 

I'm inclined to let it stabilize it's final gravity, and just bottle it. Does anyone know the ""right"" thing to do?

They are nearly unusable as certain songs will be nearly inaudible, and then the next song will be that loud that we’re scrambling to turn it down. 

We’re using the Sonos app for playback. Another issue that this causes is that the shuffle function doesn’t work properly. The same songs in the same order came on twice yesterday, when our playlist is 60 hours long. 

The issue with the audio is that glaring of a problem that I’m struggling to understand how others aren’t commenting on this, which is making us think it must be an issue with ours. 

Phoned Sonos support and they basically told me to turn the speakers and wifi off and on. It didn’t work. 

Any advice, as currently the consensus is to return these and go back to our standard cheaper bluetooth speakers. ",2,1727944092.0,sonos,2,1.0,False

1fv2vd7,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1fv2vd7/i_can_taste_the_paper_filter/,I can taste the paper [filter],"I graduated from a French press to pour over years ago. Yay for me.

At first I used the Chemex-branded paper filters, but no matter how much I rinsed them out, I could still taste the faintest traces of paper in my coffee. This drove me to a reusable Barista Warrior, and I’ve been pretty happy with it for a long while.

There seems to be animosity towards metal mesh filters due to the purity of the coffee. I don’t seem to get much sediment at all in mine, but even if I did I can’t go back to tasting the paper as I enjoy my brew.

Popping the filter in the dishwasher after a week of daily use leaves it like new.

Chemex + C40 + OKG Kettle + Barista Warrior setup.

Any others with the same predicament? Stick to current filter (are there any even better than the BW), or search for a paper filter with zero paper taste traces?

It blew my mind as a kid and reminded me of something extremely cool and futuristic because of the variety of flavors.
