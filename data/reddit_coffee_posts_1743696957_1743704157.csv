Quartz countertops on perimeter cabinets (standard 24"" deep) and island all have 1"" overhang (other than the seating area on the island with an 18"" overhang).  In the next room is a ""breakfast room"" with two high cabinets bookending a 72"" wide low cabinet (all 18"" deep) in the middle intended to hold coffee machines and stuff.  These middle cabinets have three drawers if it makes a difference. I'm feeling like a 1"" overhang (19"" total counter depth) is insufficient to support this intended use (one of my coffee machines is itself 19"" deep) and was considering a 2"" overhang to get just a little more depth.  GC says it's fine but templater thinks it will look odd because you can look through the doorway and see a 1"" overhang in the kitchen.  I'm thinking nobody but me will notice but I see the point.  I was also considering whether a tiny basic wooden corbel at each end might make the additional depth seem more intentional.

Hey coffee lovers and entrepreneurs,

I’m looking for the right investor to help build a specialty coffee and fresh pastry café with a unique strategy that I haven’t seen in the UAE.

My journey in coffee started in 2009, working in the commercial coffee industry, but my passion for specialty coffee truly began when I moved to the UAE in 2018. Over the past 7 years, I’ve worked exclusively in specialty coffee, helping launch and manage two cafés from the ground up—one in Ras Al Khaimah and one in Dubai.

My Experience:
☕ Dunkin’ Donuts, Qatar (2009-2013) – Developed strong foundational experience in coffee and operations.
☕ Starbucks, Kuwait (2015-2017) – Further honed my skills in customer experience and coffee quality.
☕ Specialty Coffee in UAE (2018-Present) – Led two specialty café projects from start to finish, handling:
✔️ Finding the right location
✔️ Designing the café
✔️ Planning budgets
✔️ Hiring & training staff
✔️ Running daily operations

Now, I’m ready to build something unique—a brand that truly stands out in the specialty coffee scene. If you’re passionate about coffee and want to be part of something exciting, let’s talk. I’m looking for an investor who shares the vision and wants to create something meaningful.

It's only gonna be me, my cat and my small dog living here but it's also good for couples without children or maybe with two small kids. It's just gonna be a bit difficult to have some privacy tho. You can even host for two people. You can turn the office into a second bedroom. Put the spare cushion underneath the bed. The lot I'm planning to buy is about 140 sqm. I think it would be amazing to have a mini vegetable garden and a small chicken coop in the city! Floor area's about 18sqm excluding porch. If you include the porch and you also want to put storage right below the bay window, that's about 25sqm for the floor area. This will also be built on land so I added a second floor for the bedroom.

I like the bay window a lot. It's a living room, dining room, and a reading nook all in one! For the TV, I'm planning on purchasing a portable one so I can take it anywhere in the house. The chairs and the table are all foldable. You can store it right below the stairs.

I tried to include everything I could ever possibly need in such a small space with some extras too. I also want an area where I can exercise indoors and stretch, or use a compact and portable treadmill if I don't feel like going out for a walk.

I forgot to put more windows on the second floor and also an exhaust for the bathroom plus a door for the mini storage upstairs. I'm still working on this. Hopefully some of you can give me feedback on how to improve this tiny house. I'm not a professional and I'm pretty new to this. I've lived in small spaces before, actually smaller than this. I thought of everything I would want in a house without having to go big and I feel like this is perfect for me. What about you guys? What do you think?

Hi everyone! I work in a procurement position in an office of about 50 in-house staff, and I was recently approached by management looking for a change in our coffee vendor. As a long-time coffee/espresso hobbyist, this was an exciting prospect. As I suspected though, most of the micro roasters I contacted don't have this sort of capability.

6 months ago:

I used to smoke daily but no alcohol. eat processed food, fast food, no physical activity, no proper sleep time. Eating late, drinking cola etc and I was 100kg

  
I am now 80kg  
I stoped smoking  
No cola/fanta/pepsi etc  
I cook at home  
If I need to eat out, I choose something light  
I drink 1,5 liter water per day  
I stopped consuming fatty foods.  
I walked 7k steps per day.  
I sleep at 11 maximum and wake up 7am (no alarm required anymore)  
I eat green/healthy

What has changed?

Alt, AST, GGT etc all those liver results were around 120/150/130 so it was pretty high. I was told that I have stage 3 fat liver.

  
Yesterday I did blood test again;  
ALT, AST, GGT and CBC results back to normal again, all within the ranges. I know this doesn't mean that all fat has left the liver but I see that function is back. I have ultrasound scheduled in 20 days to see the fat.

From now on this is my standard, not going to back to bad habits.  
I hope this gives you hope :)

I am quite good at giving presentations in front of groups of people as i have trained myself in it a fair bit but i still get a tense feeling before going in front of a group. Funny as i know i am fully capable of it and when i start to talk i know everything ill goes smoothly, Somethings just won't really change i quess.

Today was a training day again and i was very excited to train. Wasn't as slow in the morning and had a cup of coffee that didn't bother my stomach (big dub). The past week or so my lower back and stomach have been quite upset and now i am starting to think it stems from my lower back and the added stress just imflammed my stomach. Been having stomach aches and poorer bowel movements. Just slept a bit more and didn't drink coffee or sugarry drink yesterdays and it seems to have worked. As today i didn't really have any stomach aches and my bowel movement was better. Training today was fullbody C and everything went really well except for smith squats. My lower back was still very fatigued so i wasn't able to brace properly. If this lower back thingy (wouldn't call it a injury) isn't done next time around i will swap it out for a leg press variation to not have my lower back be the limiting factor. 

After training went to school which was very fun and after came home, chilled out in the sun and read. I took my shirt off to sunbathe and i can really see some progress in my physique so in a couple weeks or so i will post some pics again. The rest of the evening did some mealprep and right now i will play some warzone with a mate. Enjoy your evening guys!",1,1743703414.0,TSR_traininglog,0,1.0,False

I bought this steamer trunk yesterday and have been watching YouTube videos and Googling how to restore it and make it usable as a coffee table. I already cleaned it and used some wood milk to polish it a bit.

The problem I encountered is that the tools used in tutorials are more advanced, or the steamer trunks seem to be made of different materials, on the outside.

What would you recommend I do with average tools at home, or what are some cheap tools worth buying?

Specifically, how can I make the top part look more presentable and reduce the scratches on top and maybe get rid of that paint drip in the front? I assume some of the stains are glue residue, but they didn’t come off with normal scrubbing. Also, is there a way to reduce or remove scratches without repainting everything?

Things were great for a while, but in early October of that year she got back into contact with her ex. I wasn't super comfortable with this, but she assured me they were just friends and that she talked to him sparingly so I didn't make a big fuss.  Fast forward a couple weeks and she gets a call from him while we are hanging out because he was concerned that he hadnt heard from her all day. Alarm bells started ringing in my head; obviously she talked to him more than I was made aware. Around the same time her old FWB also started talking to her again, she was showing me a video when he texted her with a somewhat flirty message. I wasn't happy with this and she  claimed ""that's just how he is and that he knows about our relationship and that they are just friends."" 

Fast forward about a month and she maintained contact with these guys despite my discomfort; I especially felt that it was unfair that she was talking to these dudes considering she demanded I cut ties with any female friends from my end and even went as far as to demand that I deleted every female from my social media (sadly I did both for her). Eventually my paranoia got the best of me and I checked her phone while she slept. I found out that she was setting up hangouts with her old FWB behind my back and that she was pretending to be single and flirting with her ex. I broke up with her immediately, however she claimed that she was flirting with her ex for my protection because he was threatening me (he was) and that her old FWB situation was just supposed to be a coffee date to catch up (there was nothing explicit in the conversation but there were plans to meet up made without my knowledege.) She claimed that I was totally in the wrong and was being controlling. 

I ended up getting back with her and she maintained contact with both her ex and old FWB. Meanwhile, I reconnected with some old female friends and she completely lost it, claiming I only did so out of spite and to hurt her. She demanded I cut ties with them and I relented. In return, I demanded that she cut contact with these guys and she resisted, saying again that I was being controlling. This disagreement festered into a resentment that eventually ended the relationship once again. 

We maintained contact throughout the breakup. Around the 2 month mark I made friends with a girl online and my ex demanded that I block and delete her if I wanted a chance at reconciliation; again I relented. She promised that she had remained exclusive to me during the breakup and had blocked her ex and old FWB in order to heal and focus on repairing our relationship. We met up for a reconciliation date and it went incredibly well. However two days after the date, she told me that she had reconnected with an old high-school  friend that she used to have a crush on and that she was now friends with him. I told her that I wasn't cool with that and she lost it; saying that I was controlling and insecure and that there was no chance of reconciliation anymore. I blocked and deleted her contact information shortly after. 

I don't feel as if I was being unfair or controlling in trying to hold her to the same standard that she held me to. Am I wrong? She lied about how frequently she talked with her ex and old FWB; but I don't have any direct evidence of cheating either. For the sake of my future relationships; was I being ""controlling"" in being uncomfortable with her interactions with these men? I feel like I had reasonable concerns.

I've been learning the craft since last Christmas, and I got into this because I wanted to play sets of experimental electronic, dance, and downtempo/chillout music for friends at my house parties. Prior 25 years I always manned the playlists and brought lights and music to all the festival camps, hotels, and parties for our crew. My debut was NYE 23-24. It went so well I returned my then 20 day old FLX4 for a Rane Four and have been hosting monthly get togethers at my house for a close group of friends ever since! I'm comfortable with my sound, library depth, and basic skillset.  

But I'm not looking to go pro, or really even get booked anywhere (I'm 41 with kids and full time life), but I do find myself wanting more bass at my house. And maybe play a coffee shop, or skate park...  

I've agreed to help a couple of good friends throw an event at an urban open-air market this Saturday night. They are trying to get traction to have a pop-up gallery space there and entice the market-space owner to have regular art/music focused events which they(we?) help curate. And yes, I've agreed to do this first event gratis for two of my best friends.

The crowd space for Saturday is the courtyard of the market, I'll be in a mini-stall/bodega facing out. I'm bringing my gear (Rane 4, 2x Soundbox Gen 4, led lights) and my friends are supplying the main deco and visual projections. We've got 30 attendees from our friend list, and this is a prime location in Union Square, Somerville MA where foot traffic is typically high. But weather is calling for cool air and rain :(

I also wonder how good an 8"" woofer can really be? Hell, I've got 4x10"" with SB4's already... SO...

My house parties usually play through my home Hi-Fi w/ a quality 10"" sub, but during the wilder parts of the night, this doesn't feel like enough and we all agree we need more. Ideas of building something have been tossed about, but GC is showing $300 off on this model and it's in stock. The RCF also breaks from my current battery focused setup, where I  have an ecoFLow & Blutti for the Rane, laptop etc. **Anyone think the ecoFlow 1kwH could  actually power the RCF18 for 3-4 hours at a usable volume?** 

HELP I am very conflicted here.  Renting a sub seems dumb for a party I'm playing for free (and I actually I guess I'm technically paying to play cause I have get a babysitter for the night..)

Would any of these (even the smaller 12s) be helpful this weekend and then actually be viable at my house: [Guitar Center in Stock Subs](https://www.guitarcenter.com/Danvers?filters=inventoryStatus:1000;categories.lvl2:Pro%20Audio%20%3E%20Live%20Sound%20%3E%20Stage%20Subwoofers) as I'm never looking to play for 100+ at a wedding or anything larger than 30 folks at a festie camp/house party?",2,1743703242.0,Beatmatch,1,1.0,False

I should start by saying I've never been very good at meeting people, and I make a lot of awkward and cringey jokes, but if you're into that stuff we'll get along really well. 

I’m a computer science grad currently trying to get into a masters programme. I love academia and doing research and want to get a PhD after my masters. I’ll probably be getting my masters in the UK where I did my undergrad, so I’d prefer you to be in Europe as well, as that makes meeting much easier.

My personality is very nerdy, and combined with my ADHD you can always find me researching something new, which means I’ll have a lot of stuff to talk about. My current obsession is deep sea animals, and I’m a bigfin squid fan. I have a silly and sometimes dark sense of humour and watching cringey stuff on YouTube is my guilty pleasure.

My main interests are gaming, photography, astronomy, cooking, baking and coffee. I’ll happily send you pictures of things I bake or nice cups of espresso. Speaking of pictures, my parents have a lot of cats so you’ll be receiving a lot of cute cat pictures.

Looking for someone who also likes learning about the world and the universe, and whom I can just be silly and corny with.

Physically I’m 6’4 with an average build, olive skin, black medium-long hair and brown eyes. I wear glasses too, what a shock right? I know physical attraction is important so willing to exchange pictures right away if you want, but we don’t have to.

Background: 

My ex (27f) and I (28m) broke up towards the end of 2022.  I was the dumpee. It was not mutual—to say the least, I was devastated.  Classic canon event, broke my heart, all of that jazz. I wanted to marry her. She’s the only woman that I’ve ever loved. But after a couple of years of reflection on that relationship, I don’t blame her for breaking up with me.  I don’t think I was a very good partner to her. Chalk it up to me being a dipshit 25 year old who lacked the emotional maturity for a relationship of that depth. The breakup really hurt me, but I healed from that, and to be quite honest, it was the best thing that ever happened to me.  

Anyways, after we broke up, we went no contact , and after a month she told me that she didn’t want to reconcile.  I respected that decision, and I decided to move on with my life. 

Spent the next year really working on myself.  I lost a lot of weight, got in the best shape of my life, traveled the world, moved to a new city and started law school (which I am crushing), have my dream job lined up. I’ve made so many new friends and have built a new life for myself.  I got really involved in my spiritual life and truly feel like I’ve changed as a person in the best way possible. I’ve dated around a lot, have been intimate with other women, and have been in a relationship since then (didn’t work out—all good). I’m really happy with where my life is now.

In short, I moved on (I thought). 

Throughout all of this, she and I have texted intermittently. She would occasionally reach out about something random, very short conversations that I didn’t really entertain. I removed her on social media. All that jazz. But in August last year, she reached out to just ask me how I’d been.  It was the first real conversation that we’d had since we broke up and it was—nice. Kind of caught me off guard. And she’s been on my mind in the back burner ever since then.  

Well, I’m moving back to my home-city (where she lives) and to be honest I’d already been thinking about reaching out to her to see if she’d have any interest in grabbing a coffee and just catching up. Then, a few weeks ago, she requested to follow me on Instagram and that caught me REALLY off guard. And ever since then we’ve sort of been playing this cat and mouse game on social media—interacting with each-other’s profiles.  I think it’s pretty clear to me that she’s at least trying to make it known that she is thinking about me. And I don’t think she is a manipulative person who is trying to fuck with my feelings. 

I don’t know what to do y’all.  Lmao.  Part of my wants to reach out to her and try to sus out what she wants. I’m a really different person than I was when we dated, but I feel like I’ve been searching for her in every woman I’ve met. The connection that I had with her is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in my life.  On my end, it was really love at first sight. So, a big part of me is thinking that it might be worth exploring why she decided to pop back up into my life and see if she is also potentially open to reconnecting. There is a lot of stuff that I would have done differently in our relationship, now. And I am unsure why I’m feeling what I’m feeling now, when I really thought that I had moved on with my life. 

On the other hand, I’m skeptical.  She really hurt me. I’ve forgiven her, and she didn’t really do anything wrong, but I’m cognizant that this is a person who left me once, and I think that part of that old wound might have reopened.  So I want to make sure that if I reach out, that I’m A) not attached to any outcome and B) not subconsciously looking for vengeance, if that makes sense. 

I hope this was sensical.  I just need advice from random strangers on the internet lmao. Open to any and all thoughts, and happy to clarify where needed ",1,1743702775.0,BreakUps,1,1.0,False

Essentially, as I understand it, a tariff on imports from other countries, whatever they may be whether cars, steel or clothing, etc, means that businesses in the US have to pay more for it, but the extra that they have to pay goes to the government and generates revenue, essentially like a tax. This deters US companies from buying abroad, or encourages them to raise prices so they can make up for the losses from consumers, driving inflation. This tends to be how it goes. Some industries such as coffee beans that have had tariffs imposed on them, the US has never particularly produced itself, so it won't lead to any benefits in terms of creating jobs in the US and making it more self-reliant. Not to mention, this all just sounds unstable, as it is driving up prices all around the world when retaliatory tariffs kick in.",16,1743702613.0,AskUS,93,0.94,False

I always had an internal wish that I could just transfer or give my life to someone who was passing on that desperately wanted to live; a flatlining mother who wanted to see her kids again, a child succumbing to a terrible rare disease that wants to be a baseball player when they grow up, A person with a trip to Paris on their bucket list, but didn’t get to see it in time.

In school, I remember reading this Sci-Fi book called *Unwind.* It was about the aftermath of a war fought over reproductive rights. A compromise was reached, where parents could sign their children off to be “unwound” at age 13, i.e. have their body parts harvested for future use. There was a quote that resonated with me at the very beginning of the book. “I was never going to amount to much anyway, but now, statistically speaking, there’s a better chance that some part of me will go on to greatness somewhere in the world. **I’d rather be partly great then entirely useless.**” That last part always got to me.

I was born 3 months prematurely, which led to a mild physical disability in one of my arms. It’s noticeably shorter than the other and much of the muscle mass that was in it had to be scraped away like fat trimmings. While it wasn’t unusable, I still couldn’t do some tasks like a normal child would. When I first learned to write, I did it on a slanted board almost like an easel. I couldn’t support my own weight if I hung from playground equipment, and there were some gym class activities that I had to sit out of.

Oddly enough, it wasn’t the physical stuff that affected me the most. It was the mental side of things most of the time. I always had an inkling that something was wrong with me since I was little. I either made too much eye contact, or too little, I often found myself daydreaming too often, and I was too sensitive. I remember my Kindergarten teacher being my first real school bully. I was belittled for every mistake, micromanaged, singled out, and screamed at to the point of tears.

 I always felt different, and I think others perceived me that way too. It was always, “that kid’s too quiet; he’s weird; he’s a complete idiot.” For a while, I believed them. I never really got the best grades, the teacher could’ve been writing math on the board in Mandarin, and it still wouldn’t have made a difference. My grades stunk until midway through my sophomore year of high school. I excelled in my English classes, and I had a math tutor that explained thing in a way I could understand. My GPA shot up from a 2.7 to a 4.0 my junior year. Many people were happy with me and supportive, but there were always the others that acted like “why does this conceited prick think he’s so smart all of a sudden?”

I went on to college and graduated with a 3.9 overall. I even had a job lined up in my field of study (Comm. and Journalism, that’s totally useful, right?). Finally, it felt like I proved all those classmates and teachers wrong. I *was* smart enough, and I *could* do it.

Things took a turn when that dream job became a nightmare. I made less there than at the retail job I’d left to take it. I was overworked, handling the duties of an entire media team while my efforts were constantly scrutinized. I stretched myself to the point of insomnia, stress nosebleeds, and burnout, but somehow, I wasn’t a team player because I couldn’t stretch myself out just *that* much further. I eventually left for a more relaxed customer service job, which led to a marketing internship. However, I was frequently pulled away from the internship to cover staffing gaps and help a manager that didn’t know mouse shit from coffee grinds. The promise of a full-time position was dangled over my head, so I figured I’d just embrace the suck for a while. When said full-time position finally came up, I was never notified about it. By the time I applied, it was given to someone else. I took that to mean they had someone else in mind from the get-go. If I did something wrong or was just shit at my job, I wish they would’ve just told me. I was expected that I’d just crawl back to the department that overworked me like a good little invertebrate. I put in my two weeks’ notice (with nothing else lined up), so both positions ended at the same time.

Since then, I’ve been working low-paying jobs. I ended up taking a job in a mailroom. They were the only job that said yes to me after months of applying and I needed the money.

 I spent a year doing an accredited Paralegal certification while working. It honestly hasn’t been worth the time or effort. I called various law firms inquiring about positions, even ones for secretaries, and I was turned down. The one that did have an open position, told me they were looking for someone that was bilingual, on top of having the cert. I almost threw my phone against the wall after the call ended.

So now I’m officially stuck. I’m hesitant to go back to school and just shell out more cash for a degree that’s going to leave me high and dry again. I could quit my job, but I’d probably end up in some call center or back in CS. That to me, sounds like trading a rough road for a rougher one. I can’t go into the military, because if my arm doesn’t keep me out, the anti-depressants that I’m taking sure would.

If I could give my life to someone who truly wanted to hold onto theirs, I’d do it. A kid, a mom, somebody who’s worth something gets to stay, and a classic fuck-up gets to leave. It’s an even trade. When all the small victories have led to a dead end and the pattern is likely to continue, it doesn’t seem worth it. It’s like a bowling pin getting knocked down and reset. If someone out there still had a bit of fight left in them, wouldn’t it make more sense for them to have this time instead?

Are you telling me I can get millet-based products, unadulterated and organically sourced at prices *these low?* And the fact that a percentage of my purchase goes to the tribal population of my state is the cherry on top.

I checked out the wild honey, turmeric, various leaf powders and tree oils, spices etc that were in the ground floor. Settled on the Kangu Rice (foxtail millet), some Ragi Cookies and the basic Koraput Coffee for my daily morning brew. All of that for Rs.280. I also got a latte which I had while journalling in the cafe sitting space. 

The floor above is filled with tribal handicrafts - paintings, wickerwork, brasswork and what not. Did not explore much there as I had to catch the evening bus back home.

Any advice on how to get her to quit or why she started doing it out of nowhere? I don’t like spanking her but I did when she got ahold of the brand new remote the other day. I’m going to get a kennel for her for every time I leave the house even if it’s just for like 20 mins. But I’d like to leave her out of it to roam with my other dog Oreo. She’s got food and water out at all times a few toys and I give her bones regularly so I’m just super confused on why she just started doing all this any help would be appreciated.,1,1743702330.0,DogAdvice,1,1.0,False

First just incase. It took me a lot of courage just to go to the interview and I have always just backed out and turned around and walked home for every other interview because I was too scared but this one I actually went to. 

Does anyone know how I can stop feeling inferior to others? Like I feel like what if the other staff judge me, or that they’re just better than me and I’m going to embarrass myself or something. I always think everyone around me is better than me, not just at things like in a job or at school, just better in general as in more worthy, more likeable, and not awkward when it comes to social situations. I already felt like emailing and saying sorry I can’t come to my trial shift but I need a job but the social anxiety is just making me not want to go. I know I need to face my fears and do things and ofcourse in life I’m gonna need a job to get money but I’m just so worried about it. It’s in a cafe and it’s busy and there is coffee machines and tills and ovens I need to be taught how to use and work and I just think what if I mess it up or something goes really wrong. Because if something did go wrong then it would probably be a big deal like giving someone the wrong food or drink or overcharging them. Does anyone have any advice? I know I am just as equal as other people and I know that I deserve the same as others, it’s just when I’m in a group setting I instantly feel like I’m less and I’m nothing and everyone else is more important than me.

This is a throwaway for privacy reasons (and with fake names). Long time lurker, first time poster, so please excuse any mistakes. I’m not great at being concise so TLDR is at the end.

I (20F) go to a small Christian university and live in a dorm with five other girls (20ish Fs). Our dorm setup has four bedrooms—one shared by me and my roommate,let’s call her Anna, another shared by two girls, Claire and Daniell, and then two single rooms for the other girls, Beth and Emily. Anna and I roomed together last year and lived with Beth. Claire and Danielle also lived together last year, but we didn’t know each other. Emily is new to the school this year after transferring from another university so she didn’t know anyone. We’ve been living together since September, and I thought we were all pretty close.

About an hour ago, Anna came to me and said Claire and Danielle noticed money going missing from their wallets. When she told me that, my stomach dropped because I remembered that I had $200 in cash that I thought I left at my parents’ house, but I had not been able to find the few times I had searched my childhood bedroom. I had kept it in a pencil case in my desk drawer, and now I’m pretty sure it just vanished from our dorm. I have ADHD, so I sometimes misplace things (which is why I didn’t freak out), but this felt different.

Since Anna and I are really close with Beth, we immediately ruled her out. That left only Emily.

We’ve already had some issues with Emily. She constantly complains about not being included in things, but we invite her all the time—she just doesn’t like the movies we watch or want to hang out in the common areas with us. On top of that, she’s super loud at night, always on the phone, making coffee in our loud Keurig, and stomping up and down the stairs, which keeps Beth, who sleeps in the downstairs bedroom, awake.

Emily wasn’t home, so we all went to talk to Beth about it. She checked her wallet, and $50 was missing. Since none of us have cars and we mostly use our campus spending cards, cash doesn’t get used much, so it’s really suspicious that all this money is disappearing.

We have devotions tonight with our RA (Faith), and Claire and Danielle are planning on bringing it up with her privately afterwards, but we’re not sure if it’s the right thing. We don’t have solid proof, just missing money and a bad feeling. How do we handle this without causing unnecessary drama? Are we overreacting or being too paranoid? AITA for telling our RA about what we suspect?

TL;DR: Money has been disappearing from multiple roommates’ wallets, including mine. The only person we can’t rule out is our newest roommate, Emily, who we’ve also had other issues with, but we also haven't asked her if she's had issues too.

If your partner cheated and you broke up, but then decided to give it another shot—how did it go?
Were you able to rebuild trust and make it work long-term, or did it eventually fall apart again?
Also, what helped or hurt the process of moving forward?

My ex is i suspect fearful avoidantn mixed with narcicist, he witheld sex a lot, but once I opened relationship he had sex with everyone multiple times. Like with me it was once a month and after opening he did it daily with others but still not with me. 

Edit 1: First time he cheated was when we were in closed relationship and i was out of the country and met a friend for coffee. He thought i cheated (which i didnt) and cheated instead. My therapist said that i created distance and if he was FA he would be glad for that distance and would not have revenge like cheating. He witheld sex ever since beginning of relationship. This happened around 2 month mark. I didnt know he cheated so we stayed 4y in relationship. At the end i gave ultimatum, either we had sex more, we open relationship or we break up. He decided to open relationship and had sex with many people but not with me. We broke up and a month later he found a new bf. Then 2m later they broke up and he found another. He replaced me easily while i still linger and wait. I think this may be trauma bond since i think im anxious attached.

Edit 2: If he is FA and comes back I will give more ultimatums like admiting what he did, seeing a couole therapist, full transparency and I want everything that was given to strangers to be given to me.

- I was also the teen that broke several brackets and never cared to wear my retainers so that was a fair observation at that time. 

Fast forward - I would now like to have straight teeth. But would this really work using only the expanders? My teeth have moved drastically, and I can’t afford to get braces/invisaline right now.

Hi all— this is my mom’s coffee shop. Thank y’all for the love! I’m just seeing this now as I recently checked in with my mom about how things are going back home, and she was proud to mention that March was her busiest month (thanks to this reddit post!) 

My mom is the hardest working person I know— I learned everything from her. She’s also the last person I know who’d go on the internet or out in the world and boast about her achievements and process— but I will take every chance I get to shout her praises… so this is her story!

I’m 19, in my second year of undergrad. My parents moved to Oakland shortly before I was born, with my two older brothers who were 6/7 at the time. My mom stayed at home to take care of the kids, while my dad worked. Around 2010, when we were old enough, she started working at Blue Bottle as a barista.  She worked there for a bit, and while she was promoted in her roles, her favorite position was always behind the bar. She left BB when they sold out to Nestle, but continued to work within the coffee world, under a multitude of positions within the executive branch. Despite taking on a more office role within the coffee world, her love was always truly for the craft and the art of coffee, and her dream became to open up a coffee shop of her own. When I was in high school, she truly homed in on this dream, and started renting the space on Athol Ave in 2021. From then on, it’s been an uphill journey. Everything within Golden is carefully curated, from the heart of my mom and our family, to the floor of the shop. The entire process took years. Permitting, remodeling. The coffee cart that the entire shop runs out of, my dad crafted by hand! Hard work, determination, and absolute love for the craft took Golden to where it is today. Every waking moment that wasn’t spent raising me and working full time jobs of their own, was spent putting everything, everything they had into Golden. In 2023, I left for college, and now being empty-nesters, this allowed my parents more time to focus on their passions. In the spring of 2024, my mom left her job to pursue Golden full-time. Since then, it’s been history. And she’s loved every single moment of it.

Golden is a passion project. Having good business is great, but my mom does this cause she absolutely loves it. This is the most determined, hardest working woman I know. I strive every day to be half the woman she is— and I’m so happy that she’s getting all the credit she deserves. Thank you thank you thank you to everyone who supports Golden— she appreciates it and sees you. She remembers your faces—she knows and loves this community and we’re so lucky to have a community that knows and loves us! Thank y’all a million, don’t forget to #LiveGolden. :)",5,1743701756.0,oakland,0,1.0,False

1jqop4v,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1jqop4v/sharing_my_experience_going_from_mostly_vegan_to/,Sharing my experience going from mostly vegan to eating meat every day & getting diagnosed with PCOS,"I’ve been reflecting a lot on my dietary changes and how they’ve impacted my health. A few years ago, I was eating mostly plant-based. I'd eat lots of veggies, healthy carbs, and occasional vegan ""meats"" like Impossible burgers or Quorn chicken nuggets. I wasn't super strict about it, but it felt good because I didn’t like the thought of eating animals.

In the past couple of years, I've gradually started eating meat every day. This change was mostly out of convenience after moving to a more remote area with limited food options, and I kinda stopped thinking about where my food was coming from. I thought eating more protein would help me feel better, but now, I’m experiencing a lot of health issues I didn’t deal with before. I still eat a lot of veggies so it all seems to point towards the addition of meat. 

Here’s what’s been going on since I started eating more meat:
- Lethargy: I feel tired all the time.
- Increased coffee intake: I drink way more coffee now to stay awake since I'm way more tired. 
- PCOS diagnosis: After switching to meat I gained 20 lbs out of the blue and was diagnosed with PCOS. I struggle with blood sugar balance due to the hormone imbalance (taking supplements for that). My weight always remained constant and comfortable in the past. 
- Cravings: I don't let myself go crazy on junk food but I now have strong cravings all the time. 
- Lower ferritin levels: Despite eating more meat, my ferritin levels are actually lower now. How is that possible? 
- Other symptoms: Excessive thirst, water retention, higher white blood cell count due to inflammation, extremely heightened anxiety leading to frequent panic attacks, and frequent breast cysts. 

I didn’t have ANY of these issues when I was eating mostly plant-based and my blood tests previously showed that my thyroid and glucose levels were good. 

Could the poor quality of meat in the U.S., especially with hormones and additives, be disrupting my hormones and causing all these problems? Or just meat in general? I never imagined that eating more protein would make me feel worse, and I thought I’d feel better with a higher-protein diet because that's what so many people preach. I was worried in the past that I was not getting enough protein so I'm shocked at the change. 

Has anyone else experienced a similar shift in their health after changing their diet from plant-based to more meat-heavy? What about people with PCOS? I’m just trying to make sense of this shift and would love to hear if anyone’s been through something similar!

Thank you!!

1jqonfy,https://www.reddit.com/r/BreakUps/comments/1jqonfy/am_i_controlling/,Am I controlling?,"I started dating my ex back in May 2024. Things were great for a while, but in early October of that year she got back into contact with her ex. I wasn't super comfortable with this, but she assured me they were just friends and that she talked to him sparingly so I didn't make a big fuss.  Fast forward a couple weeks and she gets a call from him while we are hanging out because he was concerned that he hadnt heard from her all day. Alarm bells started ringing in my head; obviously she talked to him more than I was made aware. Around the same time her old FWB also started talking to her again, she was showing me a video when he texted her with a somewhat flirty message. I wasn't happy with this and she  claimed ""that's just how he is and that he knows about our relationship and that they are just friends."" 

Fast forward about a month and she maintained contact with these guys despite my discomfort; I especially felt that it was unfair that she was talking to these dudes considering she demanded I cut ties with any female friends from my end and even went as far as to demand that I deleted every female from my social media (sadly I did both for her). Eventually my paranoia got the best of me and I checked her phone while she slept. I found out that she was setting up hangouts with her old FWB behind my back and that she was pretending to be single and flirting with her ex. I broke up with her immediately, however she claimed that she was flirting with her ex for my protection because he was threatening me (he was) and that her old FWB situation was just supposed to be a coffee date to catch up (there was nothing explicit in the conversation but there were plans to meet up made without my knowledege.) She claimed that I was totally in the wrong and was being controlling. 

I ended up getting back with her and she maintained contact with both her ex and old FWB. Meanwhile, I reconnected with some old female friends and she completely lost it, claiming I only did so out of spite and to hurt her. She demanded I cut ties with them and I relented. In return, I demanded that she cut contact with these guys and she resisted, saying again that I was being controlling. This disagreement festered into a resentment that eventually ended the relationship once again. 

We maintained contact throughout the breakup. Around the 2 month mark I made friends with a girl online and my ex demanded that I block and delete her if I wanted a chance at reconciliation; again I relented. She promised that she had remained exclusive to me during the breakup and had blocked her ex and old FWB in order to heal and focus on repairing our relationship. We met up for a reconciliation date and it went incredibly well. However two days after the date, she told me that she had reconnected with an old high-school  friend that she used to have a crush on and that she was now friends with him. I told her that I wasn't cool with that and she lost it; saying that I was controlling and insecure and that there was no chance of reconciliation anymore. I blocked and deleted her contact information shortly after. 

I don't feel as if I was being unfair or controlling in trying to hold her to the same standard that she held me to. Am I wrong? She lied about how frequently she talked with her ex and old FWB; but I don't have any direct evidence of cheating either. For the sake of my future relationships; was I being ""controlling"" in being uncomfortable with her interactions with these men? I feel like I had reasonable concerns.

Welcome to the Graveyard Shift, eh! Honestly, I took the job because I needed the money. Simple as that. The mall’s been closed for years, left to rot like the rest of this town, but they still pay someone to keep an eye on it. A security guard to make sure no one breaks in: no homeless squatters, no teenage thrill-seekers trying to film some urban exploration nonsense. Just walk the empty halls, check the cameras, and clock out at sunrise.

Easy work.

Truth be known, the place isn’t in bad shape. Sure, there’s plenty of dust, and some of the neon signs flicker like they’ve got a death rattle, but it’s not some crumbling ruin. Even the escalators still work when I flip the breaker. The air though, that smells like a ghost of the old food court: grease, stale cinnamon, something artificial.

Too fresh, to be honest.

You know what? I tell myself I imagined that part.

The floors are still polished enough to reflect the overhead lights, but they make the place look wrong: too bright in some spots, swallowed by shadows in others. A few storefronts still have old sale posters in the windows, frozen in time: *BUY ONE, GET ONE FREE!* *FINAL CLEARANCE: EVERYTHING MUST GO!*

The last time I set foot in this place, I must have still been a teenager. Back then, it had life: shoppers hurrying between stores, kids loitering outside the arcade, the smell of cheap pizza and pretzels filling the air. That was before the crash. Before businesses dried up and moved elsewhere.

Now, it’s a corpse.

And I’m the one keeping watch over the body.

There are stories about this place, of course. Urban legends. Every town has them.

When I was younger, people whispered about shadows moving behind the storefront glass, voices coming from the empty food court, the occasional security guard who quit without explanation. I’d heard the usual ghost stories too, tales about the mall being built over burial grounds, old tunnels, places best left undisturbed. Back then, I’d laughed them off. Just dumb rumors. Now, standing alone in the middle of it all, I don’t feel like laughing. Still, I tell myself the same thing I did when I took the job: It’s just a building.

Nothing more.

I check my watch. 10:47 PM.

My shift officially starts at eleven, but I wanted to get here early. Get a feel for the place. The security office is near the old Sears, a windowless room with outdated monitors and a desk that smells like stale coffee. A single metal filing cabinet sits in the corner. It’s locked. The monitors flicker to life when I hit the switch. Twelve feeds in all. One for each wing of the mall, plus a few in the service corridors. Most show nothing but empty hallways, silent and still. The one outside the food court is the same, except for the occasional glitch, a static ripple crawling across the screen. I make a mental note to check the wiring later.

There’s an old logbook on the desk, the pages yellowed with time. I flip through it, scanning the last few entries.

June 23rd – 2:14 AM: *Heard something in the west corridor. Checked it out. Nothing there.*

June 24th – 3:41 AM: *Power flickered again. PA system made a noise. Almost like… music?*

June 25th – 4:02 AM: *Saw movement on camera 3. No one there.*

Then, nothing. No more entries. Damn… The last guard must have left in a hurry.

I grab my flashlight, clip my radio to my belt, and step out into the mall. It feels too quiet. Not just empty: hollow. The silence isn’t natural. It presses in on me, like the whole building is waiting for something. I shake the feeling off and start my first patrol.

The first hour is uneventful. I walk the halls, flashlight cutting through the dark. My footsteps echo back at me, the only sound in a place that once thrived with life. The food court tables are still set, as if waiting for customers who’ll never come. The plastic chairs are slightly pulled out, frozen mid-motion, abandoned in a hurry. A few empty soda cups remain on the tables, lids sunken, straws discolored. I try not to think about how the janitors should have cleaned all this up before the mall shut down.

The mannequins in the department store windows stand like frozen spectators, blank faces staring out into nothing. Some are missing limbs. Others are dressed in outdated clothes—pastel polos, acid-  wash jeans. There’s something wrong about the way they stand. Not quite symmetrical. Not quite balanced.

I keep moving.

The neon sign outside an old RadioShack flickers when I pass. The bulbs hum, buzzing like trapped insects. The gate to the store is down and locked, has been for years. but inside, I swear I see movement.

Just a shadow. Could be my own reflection. I don’t stop to check.

It happens near the carousel. I pause to take a sip from my water bottle, leaning against the metal railing around the ride. The horses are faded, their once-  bright colors muted with dust. Then I hear it.

Faint mall music.

I straighten up, turning my head to listen. It’s distant, like a song playing from a speaker buried under concrete. Fuzzy, warped. A tune I almost recognize, but can’t quite place. The thing is… the mall’s PA system is dead. I checked. The power is off. I grip my flashlight tighter, scanning the ceiling where the speakers are mounted. Nothing.

I tell myself it’s just sound traveling from outside. Maybe a car with the bass turned up, parked too close to the building. But the mall walls are thick. Too thick. I shouldn’t be able to hear anything. I take a slow step forward. The music is coming from deeper inside, past the carousel, down the wide corridor lined with empty storefronts. The song is half-familiar, like something I heard as a kid—an old commercial jingle, maybe. And then, it stops. Dead silence.

Like it was never there at all.

A chill runs down my spine, but I shake it off. Probably just my mind playing tricks on me. Still, I can’t help but check over my shoulder. I settle into the shift. I tell myself it’s just another night job. Walk the halls. Check the cameras. Ignore the way the darkness presses in at the edges of my flashlight’s beam.

Then the patterns start.

11:47 PM.

I pass the department store again, letting my light sweep over the display. The mannequins stand just like before, their plastic faces blank. I walk a little farther, pausing at the next storefront. The glass is covered in dust, reflecting my own tired face back at me.

Something nags at me.

I turn back to the department store window. One of the mannequins is different. Its head is tilted, just slightly, turned toward the path where I just walked. Like it’s watching. I hold my breath.

No. That’s not right.

I tell myself I must have missed it before. Maybe a trick of the shadows. Maybe I’m just tired. I keep moving.

12:20 AM.

At the security station, I check the monitors. The feeds flicker, switching between angles: grainy black- and- white shots of empty hallways. The upper level. The food court.

Then, static.

I frown. The cameras have been faulty for years, but something about the sudden glitch puts me on edge. The static clears. For half a second, I swear I see movement on the upper level. A figure, blurred by the distortion. My breath catches. I switch the feed back.

Nothing.

Just empty corridors and locked storefronts. I exhale slowly. I’m imagining things. I must be. Still, I feel colder than I did before.

1:04 AM.

I head toward the old bookstore, near the back of the mall. A wall clock still hangs just inside, its glass cracked, hands frozen in time. I shine my light on it as I pass.

4:02 AM.

I stop. That can’t be right. I check my watch. 1:04 AM. My stomach tightens. I take a step back. The cracked glass catches the light at a different angle. The hands haven’t moved. They’re stuck. I swallow hard and keep walking.

1:40 AM.

I loop back toward the security office. The department store window is on my right as I pass. I don’t want to look… But I do. The mannequin that had its head tilted? Now, it’s facing the opposite direction. I stop. My pulse hammers in my ears. I know it wasn’t like that before. I would have noticed. A feeling settles in my chest… deep, instinctual.

I am not alone.

I turn quickly, scanning the corridor behind me. My flashlight beam cuts through the dark… Nothing.

No movement.

No sound.

Just the faint buzz of an old neon sign, flickering overhead. I tell myself to calm down. It’s just my imagination. But I pick up my pace anyway.

2:12 AM.

Back at the security station, I check the cameras again. The upper level feed glitches. For a fraction of a second, I see something in the distance. Not a person.

Not exactly.

A shape… just at the edge of the frame. It disappears before I can process it. I feel cold all over. I switch the feed back.

Just me.

Just me in this whole empty mall.

3:00 AM.

I tell myself I’m being ridiculous. I need to prove it to myself. So I go for another walk- through. I check the food court. The loading bay. The abandoned arcade with its silent, screen-burnt machines. Everything is just as it should be. I start to feel better.

Then I see it.

The back hallway door, the one leading to storage rooms and old employee offices. It was locked earlier. Now, it’s open. A sliver of darkness yawns beyond the threshold. The air feels wrong… too still, too expectant. I step closer, heart pounding.

Something is waiting.

I hesitate. I mean, it could be a mistake… the lock was faulty, or someone forgot to secure it before the mall shut down. That’s what I tell myself. But my body doesn’t believe it. There’s a feeling in my gut, a tension winding its way into my limbs like a warning I don’t understand. Still, I step inside.

The hallway is longer than I remember. It should only be about twenty feet, a short stretch of bland corridor leading to the old employee offices and storage rooms. But as I walk, the air gets heavier, staler. I shine my flashlight along the floor. The tiles look different.

Older.

The linoleum pattern has changed: no longer the scuffed, off-white flooring I walked over earlier. This looks… older than the rest of the mall. A darker color, worn down in strange patterns. Like hundreds of footsteps have passed through here over the years.

I stop.

Something feels off.

I glance behind me. The door I just walked through looks farther away than it should. The hallway seems… stretched. No. That’s impossible. I keep moving. There’s another door ahead, standing slightly ajar. I don’t remember this one. It looks older, too… a heavy wooden thing, completely out of place in a building from the 1980s. The paint is peeling, and the handle is an old-fashioned brass knob, the kind you’d see in a house from decades before the mall even existed. My flashlight catches movement inside. Just a flicker… like something shifting in the dimness beyond. A trick of the air, I tell myself. Or maybe a rat. Yeah… A rat.

I step closer.

Then, the PA system crackles to life. The sound cuts through the silence like a blade. A burst of static. Then a faint, distorted whisper.

My name.

I freeze.

My skin goes ice-cold. The PA system has been dead for years. I turn slowly, flashlight trembling in my grip. The hallway behind me looks wrong. It’s longer now. I can still see the door I came through, but it’s… farther away. Like I took twenty steps, but the distance doubled behind me. That’s not possible. I turn back to the open door. The darkness beyond it feels too deep.

Something is waiting.

I don’t go through. Not yet. Instead, I step back. I reach for the doorknob and pull it shut. The second the door clicks into place, the air feels lighter. Like I just slammed something out. I stand there for a long moment, heart hammering. Then I turn and head back the way I came. I don’t check the security cameras again. I don’t want to see what’s on them.

I sit at the security desk, rubbing a hand over my face. One more hour, that’s all. Just sixty minutes, and I can be out of here. I can go home, crawl into bed, and convince myself that nothing weird happened tonight. I glance at the monitors. Something’s different. I lean forward, staring at the grainy black-and-white feeds.

The mannequins have moved.

Not just one. All of them. Every mannequin in the department stores, the clothing boutiques, even the old window displays. They’re no longer in the positions I saw them in earlier. They’re facing the cameras now. Their blank plastic faces stare directly into the lenses. A cold sensation trickles down my spine. I swallow, scanning the feeds. I know they weren’t like that before. Earlier, they were arranged normally… dressed in outdated fashion, mid- stride in fake promotional displays. But now… Now they look posed.

Deliberate.

Like they’re watching me.

I don’t breathe. I don’t blink. I check another camera. The food court. The chairs have been rearranged. Before, they were scattered, some overturned, like they’d been abandoned in a rush. But now, they form a perfect circle. Neatly arranged. Symmetrical. I stare at the screen.

Who the hell…?

No.

No one’s here. I am alone. A chill creeps through my body. Something is wrong. I reach for the radio. Static hisses from the speaker before I even press the button. A whisper seeps through. I jerk my hand away. The whisper doesn’t stop. It’s not words, exactly. Just a breath, drawn out, endless. The screens flicker.

Static.

A sharp burst of white noise blasts through the monitors, the kind of interference that makes your teeth ache. For a split second, I see it… A figure. Standing just outside the security office.

Tall. Still. A silhouette against the glass door.

I spin around. The hallway outside is empty. I know what I saw. I whip back to the monitors. The static flickers again. The figure is closer. This time, I catch details. The shape of a man. A mall security uniform, just like mine. His head is tilted too far forward. I can’t see his face. My pulse pounds in my ears. Another flicker. He’s gone. The hallway behind me is still empty.

The power flickers. The overhead lights buzz, dim, then flare. The monitors flash to black. For a moment, I am completely blind.

Then…

The sound of footsteps. Slow. Measured. Coming from inside the security office. Behind me. I whip around. Nothing. The room is empty. The only sound is my own ragged breathing. The monitors blink back to life. The mannequins have moved again. They aren’t facing the cameras anymore.

They’re facing me.

I stand up so fast my chair scrapes against the floor. Enough… I’m done.

Whatever this is, my mind playing tricks, some elaborate prank, or something else, I don’t care anymore. I grab my flashlight, my radio, and my keys. One more sweep of the mall. Then I’m out.

I don’t finish my rounds… I can’t. My hands are still gripping the edge of the desk, knuckles white, but I don’t remember sitting back down. My breathing is uneven, my chest tight like something’s pressing against it. The monitors still show the mannequins.

Facing me… Watching.

I tear my gaze away and force myself to stare at the far wall instead. I don’t check the cameras again. I don’t look at the food court. I don’t look at the mannequins. I sit in silence.

And I wait.

The PA system crackles. A soft, distant sound… like someone breathing. I press my hands over my ears.

Not real.

Not real.

Not real.

I stare at the clock on the security desk.

3:57 AM.

Three more minutes. I can make it three more minutes.

I don’t move.

I don’t blink.

3:58 AM.

The lights overhead flicker. A shadow moves. Inside the room. I shut my eyes.

I won’t look.

3:59 AM.

My radio hisses with static. A voice comes through.

Not words.

A whisper.

I press my hands over my ears. I don’t listen.

4:00 AM.

A soft knock at the door. Just one. I stay perfectly still. The air in the security office feels wrong. Too heavy. Too thick. Like something else is here with me. I don’t turn around.

4:01 AM.

The whisper stops. Everything is silent. The lights hold steady. The air feels… normal again. But I still don’t move.

Not yet.

4:02 AM.

The clock stops. A single blink… then the numbers vanish. I hear the sound of the glass doors creaking open, but I haven’t moved yet.

It’s time to go.

I stand up, legs unsteady. I don’t check the cameras. I don’t look at the mannequins. I don’t look at the food court. I just walk. Through the hall, past the empty stores, toward the exit. The glass doors feel heavier than before, but I push them open, stepping out into the humid summer air. The heat presses against me, sweat beading on my forehead. For the first time all night, I breathe.

Then I get in my car, turning the key with shaking hands. The dashboard lights flicker on. The digital clock glows in the dark.

4:02 AM.

I never checked my watch. I never checked my phone. The security desk clock could’ve been wrong. The car’s clock could be wrong. But I feel it in my bones: it’s not. Something changed inside that mall.

Or maybe… I did.

Tomorrow night, I come back. I don’t want to. But I have to.

I grip the steering wheel, my breath slowing, heartbeat steadying. It’s over. At least for tonight. I throw the car into reverse, ready to leave this place behind… And then my radio crackles. Not the mall’s radio. My car radio. A familiar tune starts playing. The same warped mall music from earlier.

My breath catches. I reach for the dial, twisting it all the way down… But the music doesn’t stop. It just keeps playing. Faint. Muffled. Like it’s coming from under the seats. Like it’s coming from inside the car. The rearview mirror flickers. For a second, I swear I see movement. A shape in the backseat. I twist around, heart pounding…

Nothing.

Just an empty car.

But as I turn back to the wheel, I see it: my reflection in the rearview mirror. Only… I’m still sitting at the security desk.

The radio hisses… then the music cuts out.

Silence.

I don’t breathe. I don’t move. Then, slowly, the clock on my dashboard changes. The glowing numbers shift, flickering, stuttering… Until they settle on:

4:02 AM.

Again.

And again.

And again.

1jqolhr,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1jqolhr/i_feel_trapped_in_my_own_apartment/,I feel trapped in my own apartment.,"I (19F) am in a relationship with a guy (34M) and I feel completely isolated. We met when I was 16, I fully knew what I was getting into at the time, I looked for older guys to date and I loved it even tho I never had much luck I usually chickened out. I never had the best parents so I wanted to find someone to take me out of my hometown as soon as I graduated. 

I started talking to this one guy, he seemed different then anyone else, we clicked more and had a lot in common. Which I know is odd but we both liked the same movies and video games. I started to really like this guy and things got serious. He loved my family, he already knew my mom since they’ve been to a couple of the same parties before. My grandmother who’s in her 50s has been dating her current boyfriend for 10 years now, they’re basically married just haven’t had a wedding, well the guy I’m talking about is her boyfriends nephew. We’re all pretty much one big family. It did make me a bit uncomfortable, he had a wife and 3 kids after all who my grandmother buys Christmas gifts, birthday gifts, etc for. Yes they tried to stop the relationship from happening but I was 16, I thought I was being rebellious and enjoying myself at the same time. 

It got even more serious, he left his wife, left his kids, he still pays for them all fully to live in his house though. (while we’re splitting the rent for a little apartment) He also still talks to her every single day about way more than just the kids. Anyway, We were together for 2 years before I graduated and moved away, at this point he’s close with my entire family and on super good terms with them, he absolutely loved them and they loved him back. Over those 2 years he kept drifting me further and further away from my friends, treating me like a child if I wanted to go for a drive with someone and didn’t let me go to a single party. Still to this day I’ve never been to a party or any social event. I didn’t even attend my grad party. 

He suggested Life360 which at 17 I agreed to, it’s still on to this day so I haven’t went anywhere other then my room and school in years. We’re moved out like I wanted all along, I’m finally away from the tiny little shitty town that I’m from and I’m in college now, which wouldn’t be possible without him as he’s paid for most of the apartment and a lot of the things in it. I’ve been here since September and it’s been hell. He proposed to me with my mom watching when we went to visit family one time, i obviously had to say yes, it was being filmed and my mom was there. My mental health has never been worse and I feel like I’m trapped in a box. 

He has cameras outside to watch if I come or go, there’s one in the house listening to me all the time but it’s pointing out towards a window. There’s also another one that I try to unplug as much as possible because we had a big argument about how uncomfortable it made me. I feel like I’m being monitored 24/7, like I said I’m 19 now and in college, haven’t been out for a drive with a friend in years, haven’t even been out for a coffee with anyone. I feel like I’m missing out on so much in life but if I leave I won’t be able to complete my courses and I’ll be homeless. 

He does work a lot so he’s gone quite a bit which makes things a little easier on me but also I’m alone 80% of the time I’m in this apartment. I just don’t know what to do. I don’t want to be engaged at 19, I don’t want to be a step mom, and I don’t want to be alone all the time. I’m not eating anymore, I’ve fallen back into SH, and I’m just full blown miserable. Does anyone even have a tiny bit of advice?",1,1743701406.0,Advice,7,1.0,False
1jqojx4,https://www.reddit.com/r/HealthTrendz/comments/1jqojx4/which_appetite_suppressant_might_suit_you_more/,Which appetite suppressant might suit you more? Green tea vs Peppermint vs Yerba mate vs ginger vs Pu-erh tea!,"## Kind of Users these Teas are best for ?

Alright, fam—let's spill some tea (literally).

The Espresso Martini always kind of bothered me, I haven't really drank them, I viewed them as a sweet coffee cocktail with no balance. Until I finally realized last week, (as I was developing a nitro cold brew version for a cocktail program) that the espresso is bitter. Boom. Balance.

I don't mean Old Fashioned in the traditional or Death & Co. sense. I developed my cocktail processing into types of balance. Bitter + Sweet, Sour + Sweet, and the flip I haven't really figured out, as it doesn't seem like true balance per se, rather complementary tastes. So I just mean in the bittersweet balance category of an Old Fashioned.

What are your thoughts?

Edit: I don't actually mean it's in the Old Fashioned category. The title is admittedly more for attention. My only question is: is it correct that the balance is coming from bitter coffee?",0,1743701031.0,cocktails,9,0.14,False

I'm at Wharton and dont have any previous 
finance experience. I went to a non target low prestige undergrad and didn't get into any elite careers like MBB or VC or IB after graduation and had a lot of anger towards myself. A few people I know followed the high finance pathway of elite UG - > elite EB/BB IB - > elite PE - > elite MBA.

Even in my cohort there are many people who followed this trajectory and many are getting their MBAs sponsored by their firm and will be returning to MF and UMM PE.

I have had a lot of resentment over the past 5 years for ruining my career at 18 by not getting into a top target undergrad, and definitely ruining it at 22 by not getting into elite IB, which will forever prevent me from getting into elite PE.

I have been extremely bitter since the program began since I was surrounded by people who already had PE offers lined up. 

My resentment and anger has shown in IB coffee chats where the frustration of not having an elite career has come out and I've gone fully nuclear. In a few coffee chats I've literally said I'm only considering IB because I unfortunately can't get into PE and the bankers have been disappointed since some of them were willing to progress me to the next round. IB is only prestigious at the analyst level and all the best analysts leave for the buy side anyway. 

I've only got internship offers for MM IB firms because I looked down on IB recruitment and all the top banks rejected me early for my attitude so I had to put on a facade to get some offers af the very least. I literally can't even be bothered at this point. My only consolation of never getting into an elite career would've been to get into a top BB like Morgan Stanley for the lay prestige so I can delude myself into thinking it's fine that I can't get into elite PE. 

I'll never be able to catch up to the people I know who did everything perfectly in their career and will outearn me significantly in PE, with far more elite careers. 

Some people at the bank I've accepted the internship at have reached out to me to take me out for lunch and I haven't even replied to them in over a week because I feel too entitled and I'm not happy with how things have turned out for me. 

I'm getting increasingly frustrated and violent and I'll probably fucking end up in prison at this rate for hitting someone out of anger ffs. I know my all or nothing mindset isn't good but I don't fucking care if I'll never be able to catch up to people I know who had perfect careers and are in far more elite places than me.

I had good grades in uni, and finishing my master now. 
We live in one house, but spearated - house has two main doors. I work from 2 pm till 11 pm, 9h shift sometimes 10h depends how much work do I have. 
I was in really bad situation, extreme poverty, there was a period when I didnt had a job, then I got one as a cleaner in the moll, while my mother was in some kind of depression (when I told her mom you have to find a job we are stinking her response was let us stink). she asked me many times to borrow money from her ex husband and I told her how long thus will take and she was like as log as I want, I told that to my father and he stopped giving her money.
Not to mention that I live in the part of the house where I dont have hot wather for showers, we dont have machine for landury and some of the nessesary stuff for normal life - so its poverty. I am  not complaining just to create image for someone who read this to understand. 
I will try to cut this as much as I can. 
The thing is, I found some good paying job, Im paying bills, Im paying part for the food as well, my mother found a part time job to clean and finaly she has her own money firdt time in her life ( i never took penny from her). But i dont give her my all earning bc she would stop working, and I belive she wld come back in the same mental state. Since, I have tricky shift 2 pm 11 pm, I laid on her to make us some food, example dinner or lunch and I was grateful for that (anything). 
the thing is many times, I come home tired extremly and hungry(i dont order food at work and I usually bring food frome home) and there wasnt food, or she locked her door and went to sleep, or there was somethig that really wasnt good. 
and a coupple of times - not every, I told her, using rly nice tone and emotional inteligence that she shld tell me if she doesnt want to cook I would get something in the store, or she could put rice to cook 15 min before I come home and I would take it over, I told her lets be team. 
But each time she would start to yell at me, to argue to fight, even if I tell her mom I dont want to fight ( with pure heart and love) and she wouldnt stop so many times, I would ran from her house into the mine to avoid conflict escalation. sometimes I had a feeling like she enjoy in tension.
Last time wasnt good. I came home exausted 10h shift, was so hungry, no energy at all. she had some situatuon at job and started to make drama and to overthink, and I was like mum you will find somethig else dont worry. I was nice to her. then I saw food what was for me made and I told her nicely rly rly nicely that she could put rice to boil 15 min before I came and I would take over. she started yelling and i told her i dont wanna fight i just asked her to act like team.. then she told me that I am crazy pointing finger in the circles and she didnt want to stop yelling speaking, drama, tension tension.... my mind went dark i pushed her on the floor she then started screaming and yelling and i put my hand on her mouth.. she went to friends house. we dont talk anymore. 
i am awful daughter. awful person.. im really bad human definetly. i am aware how wrong this was, she told everyone. told priest, told her friends, everyone. and I am aware that I am bad but i dont want to have contact with her. im still paying bills, and i see that she has miney to get herself super expencive coffee and she has for corsgretts Nd cloth, so I know she is okay. 
but someone has to understand me, I dont hate my mother, I dont have any negativity thoward her, when I was younger, super small, she use to beat me a lot to put me under blanket and to beat a hell of me.

It led me to shut myself off. I rarely left the house, and my mind was constantly filled with intrusive thoughts that kept me from functioning properly.


During a health check-up, I opened up to my doctor about my struggles for the first time. She prescribed me the generic version of Zoloft and told me it was worth a try.


The first week was exactly what you’d expect, horrible. On day one, I slept for 20 hours. The following days, I had nausea, felt constantly exhausted, and my morning anxiety was worse than anything I’d ever experienced.
But I held on, cut out coffee and processed foods, started eating three meals a day, and practiced breathing exercises every morning.


On day 6, I woke up with no intrusive thoughts. I went for a walk, and it felt like I was seeing the sky for the first time.


On day 8, I met up with a friend in the city, and I didn’t panic once. I even chatted with a cashie, something I usually avoided by letting my husband speak for me.


Today, things aren’t perfect, and there’s still a long way to go, but I’m better. I’m so glad I had the courage to open up to my doctor. I wouldn’t go back for anything in the world.

I originally got the larger XF model because I imagined I would usually be making coffee for myself and my fiancé at the same time and figured I would use less filters. However 90% of the time though I am brewing single doses, and I’ve really dialed it in to get tasty cups with decent flavor separation while maintaining a hearty body. I recently picked up a Stagg X and Mighty Carafe bundle since it was such a good deal, and I tried brewing with it for the first time today using the same recipe. I noticed a much weaker taste and slower flow through the dripper, with the holes being even more clogged than they normally are on my Stagg XF. 

Anyone else have this experience? 

I was brewing 25g coffee (PERC’s ‘PERC Up’ blend) to 400 mL of water so maybe the dose was too large for the smaller brewer? I used a scaled up version of Hoffman’s V60 recipe, as that’s what I normally use with the XF. Grinding at a 4 on my Ode 2 with stock Gen 2 burrs, which has been my go to setting for the coffee I was using after dialing it in on previous brews with the XF.

I started Vyvanse at 20MG around 7 months ago for Binge Eating Disorder but also ADHD. I am now on 60MG as of a month ago. I noticed with all dosages I could only take it everyday for maybe around up to 2 weeks and then it would get to a point where I couldn’t wake up in the mornings anymore and would sleep through all the alarms I set to wake up early to take my medication and would sleep until around 1-2PM. I wake up feeling like my brain hurts or is just exhausted from taking this medication everyday. So usually when it got to this point I would try to take a break from it from 1-3 days, and then the cycle repeats. But a lot of times I don’t WANT to have to take a break every 2-ish weeks because I have things I need to be doing/get done and when I take a break I literally sleep ALL day and am bedridden for those 1-3 break days (literally can’t move out of bed). 
Before bumping up to 60MG last month, I was on 50MG, but like the dosages before, it got to a point where it would only work well for maybe 3-4hours (me being able to be productive and out of bed or not exhausted mid-shift at work). Usually at work I would have to drink a coffee just to make it through the other 4 hours of my 7 1/2 hour shift. With the 60MG I’m on now, I’m already having to drink a couple sips of a coffee around 4hrs into my shift at work because I feel semi-exhausted and I’ve only been on the 60MG for almost 1 month. My psychiatrist had mentioned that if the 60mg Vyvanse didn’t work out for me that she wants to switch me to Adderall. I’m worried though because I looked it up and Vyvanse is labeled to be prescribed for binge eating disorder, but I don’t think Adderall is? And I don’t want to start binge eating 24/7 again and gain all/some of the weight I’ve lost back. I also have tried someone’s extended release Adderall 2-3 times in college and did not like it. I felt like a zombie. (but that wasn’t prescribed to me and I don’t remember what dosage it was). I’m also worried if Adderall is more addictive that Vyvanse. Side note: I do sometimes eat a protein bar in the morning (but not everyday). And if not, I typically don’t eat anything until late afternoon or end of the day (and I’m not a very healthy eater). I also have supplements Magnesium L-Threonate, Vitamin B12 and D3, and well as a Lionsmane supplement mixed with Cordyceps, Reishi mushroom, and Shiitake mushroom on my nightstand but don’t currently take them. Idk if taking any of those might maybe help??

I’m wondering, do any of you have any tips for making Vyvanse not make me feel like brain death every 2-ish weeks? 
Any tips to make it last longer?

Have any of you tried Adderall instead for B.E.D. and ADHD? 
How was Adderall compared to Vyvanse? Do you like Vyvanse more or Adderall more and why?

One of them (let’s call her D) is actually perfect to live with! She’s my best friend at college and living with her is so easy. She cleans up after herself and I love having a room next to her. 

The other one (L) could be better. We had issues with her leaving dishes in the sink, but D talked to her and that has been fixed. The issue now is that L will just not wipe up any food stains/crumbs off the counter. It also extends to the coffee table in the living room. 

D admitted she cleans up a lot after L. I encouraged her to stop so she did. Yesterday, the stove had food stains/some crumbs/cat hair (L and D got a cat together, surprise surprise L does little to care for it).  I sent her a non confrontational message asking her to clean it up and to be more mindful about wiping down the stove after cooking since it was my second time this week asking. 

She sent back a defensive message saying “I did, the cat just jumps up against and again.” I just sent back I don’t mind disinfecting the counters before I cook since I love the cat, but I don’t want to clean up others messes. 

D also won’t take out the trash or vacuum unless asked. Isn’t it common 
courtesy to know to do those things when living with others? More importantly, I just don’t understand why she gets so defensive. It’s not a personal attack me asking you to clean, it’s legit just a request lmao. I would typically move, but I love the apartment/living with L and there’s a chance I could get someone worse.

If that message doesn’t improve anything, I’ll sit her down and have a sterner talk. I’m not necessarily looking for advice, just venting to strangers and seeing if anyone has explanations for her behaviors. As of now, D is upset with L for a multitude of reasons and is keeping her distance. ",2,1743700019.0,badroommates,2,0.75,False

1) What are some must-have foods especially for a local breakfast experience?

2) Are thrift shops a thing in China? If so, where should I visit in CQ?

3) Is there somewhere I can find accessories like silver jewelry made by local craftsmen?

4) I'm planning to visit the Arhat Temple. I'm not sure if they sell statues but I'm really curious to where I may purchase legitimate Buddha statues.

5) Whenever I'm overseas I love to wander and explore the streets to snap photos of people in their daily lives. Where are great places to experience the local life?

6) Are there any simple trails that I can hike in CQ? Or are there any recommended routes to experience and marvel at the beauty of the architecture in CQ?

7) As an avid coffee and tea fan, I would love to know where are some great cafes/teahouses. Would prefer less touristy places.

8) I'm planning to bring home tea leaves, are there any great local recommendations?

9) Are there any stores that specialise in leather boots? I'm talking moc toes and monkey boots. I'd love to explore the local leather scene if any or are there any reputable Chinese brands/artisans?

10) Are there local denim specialty stores? I've seen a brand 粘酱 on Taobao and I was wondering if there is somewhere I could try their products, or if there are any CQ local denim brands. Recently started exploring raw denim again.

The issue is: I usually REALLY don't like gold trims, I don't like gold things in general. Seeing photos of this pen, though, made me think if - maybe - there's one exception for me.

I have a bunch of 3776's with rhodium trims and coppery trims. I held in my hands, once, the Coffee Jelly model and I loved the color choice for the resin but the gold trim just didn't do it for me. I once bought a pen that was described as having rose gold trims (not a Platinum) but they were too yellow for my liking and ended up selling it because I just couldn't use it: seeing that gold nib while I was writing was too distracting, my personal taste could not stop looking at that awuful color :D

On the other hand, this model is a bit different. There's painting all over it that could be very well complemented with those trims and I could pass over the golden nib, if I really liked the pen overall.

So: I'd really like to see some real photos. Sellers try to sell, they always stage their photos, even when they don't use official promotional material. I'd prefer to see how it looks in real life, with normal everyday lights, and - if possible - next to other 3776's models.

I wanted to share some interesting facts about the 36-hour fast, a popular intermittent fasting method. Here are some key points:

1. **What is it?** The 36-hour fast involves abstaining from food for a full day and a half. Typically, you eat dinner on Day 1, skip meals on Day 2, and resume eating breakfast on Day 3.
2. **Benefits**:
   * **Improved Metabolic Health**: Fasting can help regulate blood sugar levels and improve insulin sensitivity.
   * **Cellular Repair**: Extended fasting periods promote autophagy, a process where the body cleans out damaged cells and regenerates new ones.
   * **Weight Management**: It can aid in weight loss by reducing calorie intake and boosting fat burning.
3. **Challenges**:
   * **Hunger**: The most obvious challenge is dealing with hunger pangs, especially during the first few fasts.
   * **Energy Levels**: Some people may experience low energy or fatigue, so it's important to listen to your body.
4. **Tips for Success**:
   * **Stay Hydrated**: Drink plenty of water, herbal teas, or black coffee to stay hydrated.
   * **Ease Into It**: Start with shorter fasting periods and gradually increase the duration.
   * **Stay Busy**: Keep yourself occupied to distract from hunger.

Remember, fasting isn't for everyone, so consult with a healthcare professional before starting any fasting regimen. Have you tried the 36-hour fast? Share your experiences below! ",1,1743699086.0,NutriActiveWellness,0,1.0,False

1jqnh68,https://www.reddit.com/r/groomingvictim/comments/1jqnh68/a_week_of_realizations/,a week of realizations,"I don't have much to say, I'm mostly just heartbroken right now. I met my groomer, let's call him C, when I was 18. He was the leader of a queer burlesque organization that I joined with my then boyfriend. When we broke up, I was destroyed and threw myself into the organization. 

C was 10 years older than me, but he always assured me there was nothing untoward about our relationship and I believed him. He convinced me all my age appropriate friends were temporary, love bombed me, and I was putty in his hands. It was never sexual but he had complete control over my life and mental health. If he called I'd be there, no matter how far away or how busy I was. He turned me away from my family and convinced me the organization was the family I never had. 

After I got back from being abroad this summer, everything went bad. I had met someone, and I'd grown a lot over the summer. I stopped humoring him and accepting his constant victim mindset. I wanted to help him get better. He was a deeply unwell individual, both physically and mentally, and I felt responsible for him (I'm EMT trained). He would push me away, pull me back in, ignore me for weeks, then apologize for his absence with a gift or a 5-10 hour hangout. He would constantly claim he was going to stop using me as his therapist because I ""wasn't an adult"" and he was ""accidentally pushing my boundaries,"" but he would go right back to it the next time we saw eachother. He tried to convince me that my relationship with my boyfriend was temporary (I have a history of serial dating), and accused my new close friends of being a ""clique"" and tried to turn me against them too. 

We were in conflict for months, me constantly running back to him, up until I finally cut him off earlier this month. It was only after I had left the organization and blocked him (and his friends) on everything that I was contacted by another one of his victims (lets call her D). Finding out that not only was I not the first, but I KNEW multiple other people that he had abused, groomed, or publicly defamed and he had made me hate them. I spoke to his other victim over coffee yesterday, and I now know he's lying about me at the organization, just like he had done to D. 

I'm honestly heartbroken, my memories with him used to be the happiest ones I had. Now, everything is tinged with disgust and discomfort. He was wrong about me, I'm not going to be him. My boyfriend and I are still strong, I'm doing well in my classes, and I'm going to have a future. He wasn't a good friend, he was abusing me. 

It's killing me because I still miss how it felt to know him, to be close to him, to have family. He's started getting close to my previously mentioned ex-boyfriend, who is also vulnerable and currently 19. I pray for him despite my disdain for him, I really just want the organization to fail so he loses his hunting ground. ",1,1743698843.0,groomingvictim,1,1.0,False

As they heat up, they expand and release moisture, causing an audible *crack*, just like popcorn popping!



Coffee beans experience two distinct cracking stages during roasting, known as **first crack** and **second crack**:

•    **First crack** sounds like popcorn popping and marks the transition from light to medium roast. At this stage, beans are more acidic and have pronounced fruity or floral notes.

•    **Second crack** is a quieter crackling sound. It signals the transition from medium-dark to dark roasts, where beans become darker, oilier, and develop deep, bold flavors with less acidity.



If you stop roasting before second crack, you get a balanced and flavorful coffee. If you go beyond it, the coffee becomes darker, more bitter, and takes on smoky notes.

It’s like my system immediately shifts into *over-functioning*. I start unconsciously giving away so much of my mental and emotional energy to her. I'm constantly scanning:

>“What would make her happier?”  
“Should I clean the house? Bring her coffee? Say something sweet?”

It’s coming from love, yes. But it becomes **toxic for me**.

Because when I’m around men — friends, colleagues, roommates — I don’t do that. I stay focused. I stay in my own center. I don’t obsess.

But with someone I love, I start *abandoning my self-care*:

* I sleep later
* I procrastinate on my work
* I learn and progress less
* I meditate worse
* My Default Mode Network activates, I ruminate
* I feel less smart, less confident
* Basically... I lose **my sovereignty**

What’s wild is this happened with my **last 3 relationships**, so I know it’s coming from **me**, not them.

And here’s the part that really confirmed it for me:

>When I travel to another city (we’re \~6 hours apart now), everything shifts.  
Suddenly, I feel clear.  
My meditations deepen.  
My productivity flows.  
My creativity unlocks.  
My mind stops spinning.  
I feel powerful again — just being in my own energy.

So I know this **pattern activates when I’m physically near the woman I love**.  
It’s not love itself — it’s a nervous system response. A survival program I must have built years ago.

I’ve been to 2 Joe Dispenza retreats, and I *know* this can be reprogrammed — but I’m not sure **how to tackle this specific dynamic** using his or any practice. It’s like my nervous system gets hijacked by the presence of love + the fear of losing it.

Have any of you gone through this?  
Have you been able to rewire that “give-everything-to-keep-love” script?

I’d love any guidance, or even just stories, that could help me stay **present, rooted, and in love — without losing myself.**",2,1743698719.0,DrJoeDispenza,0,1.0,False

and then she literally crashed out on me a bit inside the bar, in front of my SSV and told me to “you can do the registering if you want, that’s fine with me. but don’t get involved or tell me what to do. ask the SM of you want to be on the till. but when you do that it makes my head confused” but she told me all that in such a rude and disrespectful manner. and she later on complained about this to my SM bc she didn’t want anyone “nagging into her when she’s on the cash register” the problem is, on that moment she wasn’t even doing cash registering bc of the front-closing. when she was walking out of the office she got out in a rush for a smoke break and hit my shoulder as she was walking out. 

my SM just told me to “sometimes we can do things that affect others badly without knowing, i don’t know what to say either. just do your thing”

we talked about this deeply when we were in the bus, going back home bc i liked her and didn’t want her to give me the cold shoulder and told her that my intentions were good and she understood that. and she was glad that i talked about this and all

2 days later on, she was on the cash again and a guest was getting a food order and she was a regular. she was getting a turkish coffee and she decided to get our new pistachio cake. the thing about the cake is, it used to not supposed to be warmed up but later on, the campus post has later on mentioned that you can warm it up with the misto cookie setting. and it seems like she has missed out on that, i was there and i asked the guest if she wanted us to warm it up. and both my partner and the guest was confused for a second and i made clear that we can warm it up on that setting. the guest didn’t want it anyway so does that even matter? i don’t know anymore. 

anyway i served our guest the cake on the hand off. the guest whispered me about how tense my partner looked right there. and oh boy was she… 

she was in tears and got out for a little break. and both of my SSV’s wondered and talked about what was going on between me and her. and i was like it’s literally nothing personal and nothing in bad intentions. i was just trying to be helpful but i guess that seemed to be the opposite. just because she was being confused bc i asked the guest if they wanted me to warm their food.

to make things worst, she was so pissed ofc that she mentioned that she’s gonna demand a transfer to another store from our SM. that would be her 2nd transfer. 

i didn’t expect all this go way too intense like that. i’m trying my best but yet still get punished for it and i have to get defensive everytime. that sucks cuz i liked my partner, she’s usually chill and i just wanted her to thrive out from her mistakes which she’s known for tbh.

Anyway, last September I noticed someone new at my bus stop, it’s a small stop in Gordon head so I typically see the same people there. I’d say she’s in her mid 30’s, I had made small talk a few times and all seemed well. We walk down the same stretch of road and at one point I was about 50+ yards behind here, after I crossed the road I noticed she yelled something out at me, I took my headphones off and asked her pardon? She then proceeded to accuse me of following her, then sticking a can of pepper spray in my face, I fully panicked but was able to keep my composure thankfully. I explained that I live on the same street and that I frequent this bus stop almost daily. It took a lot of convincing to get her to eventually take the pepper spray out of my face. 

After the bus came we both got on and I intentionally sat far away as possible from her as I could. I was so shaken as I struggle with pretty severe anxiety in general and this was quite triggering. 

It’s been many months of her coming to the same bus stop as me, staring me down, purposely getting very close to me and budging to get into the bus first. I have no idea what I did to aggravate this woman but I don’t think it really matters. So often she will make comments at me or my partner as he often walks me down to the bus stop

After this whole pepper spray incident I’ve seen her waiting outside my gym I visit downtown, running away after we make brief eye contact. As well as following me into coffee shops to sit across from me and watch me. 

I called the police after the pepper spray incident, they said to avoid her at all costs. But sadly the bus stop we both go to has a long distance between alternatives. 

I don’t know what to do, I feel scared almost everyday thinking I might run into her again. 

Has anyone dealt with anything similar? Is this harassment ?

But now you need‌ a HomeKit hub, the brains of the operation that allows ‍you to control your devices remotely ‍and set up powerful automations. The big question: Apple TV ​or HomePod Mini? This Apple TV vs HomePod Mini HomeKit performance showdown is a common debate, often discussed on platforms‍ like homekit hub Reddit threads.

## What Exactly is a HomeKit Hub, and Why Do You Need One?

Think of your HomeKit hub as the central coordinator for all your smart home devices. It connects your HomeKit-enabled accessories, enabling remote access when you're away⁢ from home, and ‌powering those handy HomeKit automations that make‌ your life easier.⁢ without a dedicated hub Apple ecosystem devices homekit communication will‌ be limited to ⁣your local ‍network.

Here’s a more detailed look at what a HomeKit hub does:

*   **Remote⁢ Access:** Control your lights, locks, thermostats, and other smart devices from anywhere in the world using your iPhone, iPad, or‍ Mac.
*   **Automation:** Set up triggers for​ your devices to react based on time of day, location, or events like sunrise and sunset. Imagine your lights automatically turning on‌ as you ⁢approach your house, or your thermostat adjusting ⁤when you leave for work – all thanks to HomeKit automations.
*   **Scene Control:** Group multiple devices together and‌ control them with a single ‍command. A ""Goodnight"" scene,for example,could turn off all the lights,lock the doors,and set the thermostat to a cozy sleeping temperature.
*⁢   **Guest Access:** Grant temporary access to ⁢your HomeKit setup ‌for guests,allowing​ them to control‌ specific devices during their stay.
*⁣   **Enhance Homekit Security**: A dedicated hub communicates⁣ with Apple's secure servers,further enhancing the security​ of your Apple homekit ecosystem.

While you can control HomeKit devices using your iPhone or iPad while you're at home (connected to the same Wi-Fi network), a dedicated HomeKit hub is crucial for truly ​unlocking the full potential of your smart​ home. It‌ allows​ you to seamlessly manage and automate your smart devices, even when you're​ miles away.

## Apple‍ TV and HomePod Mini: The Contenders ​for Best HomeKit Hub

apple gives you two main options⁤ for a HomeKit⁣ hub: the Apple‌ TV and ‍the ‌HomePod Mini. Both devices serve as HomeKit hubs,but they have different⁣ strengths and weaknesses.### Apple TV: The Entertainment Powerhouse

The Apple ‍TV is primarily designed as a streaming media player, delivering high-quality video and audio‌ entertainment to your TV. However,it also doubles as a robust HomeKit hub.

*   **Pros:**
    *   **Reliable Performance:** the Apple TV generally offers excellent HomeKit hub reliability due to its processing power and wired network option (Ethernet).
 ​   ⁣*   **Wired Connection (Ethernet):** ⁤Unlike the HomePod mini, the Apple ⁣TV has an ethernet port for a more stable and ‍faster network connection, ‌and therefore, a‌ more responsive HomeKit experience. Homekit hub wired vs wireless, wired connection ‌is typically preferred for reliability. This robust connection contributes to the Apple TV homekit hub features being very reliable.
    *   **Powerful Processor:** The Apple ​TV boasts a powerful chip⁢ and handles complex automations and‌ a⁢ large number of devices with ease.
    *   **Seamless Integration:**⁣ Integrates smoothly with your TV and other Apple ‍devices,providing a unified entertainment and smart home experience.
  ⁢  *   **tvOS Updates:** Receives regular software updates through tvOS, ensuring​ continued compatibility, security patches,⁣ and new features.
    *⁢   **Family Entertainment:** In addition ⁤to Homekit duties, an Apple ‍TV provides access to streaming services, Apple ⁢Arcade, and ⁤more, ‌turning your TV into a complete entertainment hub.

*   **Cons:**
    *   **Price:** The Apple TV is substantially more expensive then the HomePod Mini. You can easily see this ⁢when⁢ you look at the apple tv ⁢price versus the homepod mini price.
⁢    *   **No Built-in Microphone:** You can’t directly interact with Siri on the Apple TV unless you use the Siri Remote. Which⁣ makes the⁢ homepod ​mini⁣ as home hub much⁤ easier for voice commands.
    *   **Not Always⁢ Ideal Placement:** Placement is dictated by your TV, which may not be the optimal ⁢location for HomeKit hub range, ⁤especially if your smart⁢ home devices are scattered throughout the house.###⁣ homepod Mini: The Smart Speaker Star

The HomePod Mini is a compact ⁣smart speaker designed primarily for music playback and Siri voice commands. Yet, it also functions as a capable HomeKit hub.

*⁢   ⁤**pros:**
    ⁢*  ⁢ **Affordable:** Much more budget-friendly than the Apple TV, making ⁢it an accessible entry point into the ‍HomeKit ​ecosystem ⁣and you can often find homepod mini deals if you look out.
    *   ‍**Built-in Siri:** Features a built-in microphone and Siri integration for hands-free voice control of your HomeKit devices.This makes using homekit scenes and homekit ⁣automations easier.
    *   **Compact and⁤ Discreet:** Its small size allows for flexible placement throughout your home, ⁢optimizing HomeKit hub range.
    *   **Audio Quality:** provides⁣ surprisingly good audio quality for its size, making it a decent option for casual music listening.
   ⁣ *   **Thread⁢ Support:**​ Supports Thread, a low-power ‌mesh networking protocol that enhances the reliability and range of compatible​ HomeKit devices ⁣(like Eve ⁤products).
    *   **intercom Feature:** Allows you to easily communicate with other HomePod speakers in your home.

* ⁢  **cons:**
    *   **Wireless Only:** Relies solely ⁤on Wi-Fi, ‍which can be less stable than a wired​ connection like ethernet.
  ⁢  * ‌  **Less Powerful Processor:** Its processing​ power is less than ⁤the Apple TV, which could possibly impact performance with a large number of devices or complex automations.*⁤   **Homekit Hub Compatibility**: While still an effective hub, its capabilities are slightly less performant when compared to the Apple TV, notably regarding handling a vast number of HomeKit devices ‌or complex custom automation scripts.

## Apple ​TV⁢ vs HomePod Mini HomeKit Performance: ​A Deep ​Dive

Let’s compare the two‌ head-to-head in several key areas to help you decide which ⁤is truly the⁢ best HomeKit ‍hub for your needs.

*  ⁣ **Reliability:** The Apple TV ‌generally wins​ in terms of reliability, thanks to its Ethernet option.A ‍wired connection eliminates potential Wi-Fi interference, ensuring a more stable and responsive ‍HomeKit experience. While the HomePod Mini is usually reliable, its performance can be affected by Wi-Fi‍ signal strength ‌and network congestion.
*  ⁤ **Range:** The HomePod mini, ⁢with its smaller size, can be placed‍ strategically throughout your home⁣ to ​maximize the range of your HomeKit network. The Apple TV's location is often limited by the location of your TV. Thread support on⁢ the HomePod Mini can also extend the range of compatible devices.
*​   **Performance:** For most users with a moderate number of HomeKit devices, both the Apple TV and HomePod Mini⁣ offer adequate performance. However, if you have a large number⁢ of devices or complex automations, the apple TV's more ⁣powerful processor ​will likely provide a smoother experience.
*   **Setup:** Both‍ devices are relatively easy to set up. The Apple TV's setup process is guided by ⁣your TV screen, while the ⁤HomePod Mini integrates seamlessly with your ⁤iPhone.
*   **Power Consumption**: Neither device consumes a significant amount of power. The HomeKit hub power consumption is minimal for both,⁤ contributing ⁢little to your electricity bill.
* ‍  **Features:**⁣ The Apple TV ⁢offers additional ​multimedia features, allowing you to stream movies, TV shows, and play games. The homepod Mini focuses on audio⁣ playback and Siri voice control. Consider which features are more vital to you.

## Choosing ⁤the Right HomeKit Hub for You: A Step-by-Step Guide

to make the right​ decision, consider the following factors:

1.  **Budget:** This is a primary factor. The HomePod Mini is significantly‌ more affordable than the Apple ‌TV, especially if you are looking for homepod mini deals.
2.  **Number of Devices:** If you have a ⁤large number ‌of HomeKit devices,the Apple TV is generally recommended due to its more powerful processor.
3.  **Automation Complexity:** If⁤ you have complex automations (e.g., involving multiple devices ⁤and triggers), the Apple TV⁢ may⁤ provide a smoother experience.
4.  **Network Setup:** If you have a reliable Wi-Fi network, the HomePod Mini might​ be sufficient. However, if you prioritize stability and speed, the Apple TV with an Ethernet connection is the better choice.
5.**Voice Control:** If voice control is a priority, the HomePod Mini’s built-in Siri integration is a major advantage, enabling easy use of​ homekit scenes and homekit automations.
6.  **Entertainment Needs:** If you want a​ device that can also‌ stream movies, TV shows, and play games, the ⁣Apple TV is the obvious choice.
7.  **Location, Location, Location:** Where you place the device matters. The HomePod Mini's compact size allows for placement in areas that maximize range.

Here are some homekit hub recommendations depending on common scenarios:

*⁣   **Beginner:** If you're just starting with HomeKit and have a limited budget, the homepod⁤ Mini is a great entry⁤ point,⁢ and the ​Apple Homekit beginner guide is useful.
*   **Advanced user:** If⁢ you have a large HomeKit setup with ‌complex automations, the‌ Apple TV is the better choice for its reliability ​and performance.
*   **Voice Command User:** If voice commands are​ critical, the built-in Siri ⁣with the HomePod Mini‌ is a huge boon.
*   **Entertainment Focus:** If ⁤you consume a huge amount of streaming​ content, the Apple TV is an ideal, central ​device for your‍ entertainment and smart-home needs.[[Explore Top Rated homekit hub apple tv vs homepod mini reddit on Amazon.]](https://storeins.com/external-ssd/?kw=homekit hub apple tv vs homepod mini reddit)
## Final Thoughts: Is it Apple TV as Home Hub or a ⁣Homepod Mini?

Ultimately,the best⁤ HomeKit hub for you comes down to your individual needs and priorities. If you value reliability, performance, and entertainment features, the Apple⁢ TV is the clear winner.

I am 7mo post op and about 75lbs down. I have kinda stalled out, only losing 1-3lbs a month. I want to push through this, and have pushed my but into high gear. I've upped my daily step count, restarted healthy habits that have fallen off the wagon (like meal tracking), and even got a personal trainer for the next 6 weeks at work. I know I also need to up my water and protein intake, but I hate drinking water with a passion! Trying to hit my fluid and protein goals have always been incredibly difficult. What helped at first was substituting a breakfast meal with a protein shake, and I have cases of the chocolate fairlife shakes in my pantry.  
  
However, I have now become OBSESSED with dirty soda. Particularly dirty Dr. Peppers: Sugar free Dr. Pepper strawberries and cream with half a vanilla core power. I recently saw a tiktok about a chocolate covered strawberry drink (Monster Zero mixed with chocolate core power) and I thought it may be a good idea to reach out to the community.   
  
What are some of your favorite drinks to help get your fluid goals? Could be summer mocktails, dirty sodas, protein shakes, or whatever it is that helps you hit your goals! I don't like coffee, but am totally open to us sharing fun coffee recipes too!

As Mothers Day is approaching in the next month here in the US, I’m reflecting on how liberating it is that I no longer have to comb through the Hallmark cards to find the most generic, simple, basic “Happy Mothers Day” card because all the other ones about “the best mom ever” or all the kind things she does didn’t apply and felt dishonest.

I’m going to spend the money I would have spent on a card for her on some kind of fancy coffee for myself. I’ll spend the time I would have spent driving to her house on a nice walk for myself. And instead of celebrating her, I’ll celebrate myself for surviving and healing. 

I still have hard days where I feel angry and isolated, but I have had very, very few days where I’ve truly missed her. If you’re looking for hope or are having a difficult time, know that there is liberation on the other side of NC. 

It may not always be easy, but the more time that goes on the more I realize I truly owe her nothing.

I kept sleeping for another hour and a half with a few wake ups in there and everytime i was hard.

Within my day i have more stable energy and slightly more drive to do stuff however the biggest difference is that i dont have a crash in the afternoon and no brain fog.

The box was shrink wrapped. No issues with double labels. I don't have a reference so I can't say whether the labels look right or not for sure, but everything looks right. All the parts that come with it were right. The catch cup contained a desiccant, which makes sense. The brushes were contained in a plastic sleeve. Everything looks legit.

I started an anime-inspired specialty coffee brand.  My original inspiration was Tokyo Ghoul due to its ties with coffee and the fact that I started drinking coffee because of it. Although I love TG, I want to expand my coffee catalog to include other anime and reach a wider audience.

I always try to find some sort of link between the coffees I make and the anime. For example, Juuzou is a character in TG who loves sweets. So I matched him with a coffee blend that has natural sweetness.

Questions:
What anime or characters would you want to inspire your cup of coffee? And how would you describe the taste or design?

I am more interested in the anime's aesthetics rather than just its popularity.

1jqmutm,https://www.reddit.com/r/juryduty/comments/1jqmutm/a_walk_through_of_an_uneventful_summons_in_the/,A Walk Through of an Uneventful Summons in the 43rd District Court in Michigan,"As a neurodivergent human who must endlessly scour the internet for every little tidbit of information before doing something new, I couldn’t find much about what to expect when reporting for jury duty. So I promised myself that I would report in as much detail as possible for the next person who feels similarly to me. I understand that each court house operates differently, so this is specific to the 43rd District Court in Madison Heights, Michigan. This is everything that happens before you reach voir dire since this group of jurors didn’t make it that far. Essentially, this is probably what most of us reporting for jury duty will experience. 

**PARKING AND ENTERING**
My letter told me to show up at 9AM so I made sure to arrive no later than 8:45. There were already lots of people there, so I probably could have gotten there earlier if I really wanted to. 
I parked in the nice big parking lot and walked in. As soon as you enter, there is a security check with a metal detector and X-ray convey belt. The guard that checked me was super nice—way nicer and easier than airport security. I had on a coat and a backpack that both went into the x-ray and I stepped in the metal detector. It beeped and I had to get a wand check, but it was just my necklace so he let me in. Easy peasy! 

**CHECK IN**
There was a big room with a lot of chairs and I was confused why it was empty at first. There was a check in table with a sign that said “juror check in” and I walked up and she asked my name and juror number. I asked if she needed my summons letter and she said it wasn’t necessary, but then she asked for anything with my name on it (I assume she thought I was asking because I forgot it) so I opened my backpack and pulled out my summons. In retrospect, it probably would have been easier to have it in my hand before walking into the building since this was all sort of all one swift movement. 
She took the summons and had me sign my name and then gave me an envelope with a half day payment ($20) and a name tag sticker that said my juror number (which was the same juror number on my summons). 
During this part, I noticed two gentlemen lingering around the lobby area dressed in suits. I assumed they were lawyers checking out the potential jury pool and getting some first impressions based on interactions with security and all that. 

**ENTERING THE COURT ROOM**
The reason why the big lobby room was empty was because they just had all the jurors go right into the court room which I didn’t expect based on the other Reddit threads I read. There were probably about 40 potential jurors in the room just chilling and being completely silent. I noticed that I was the only one wearing a blazer with a backpack so I felt like a huge dork. I also wondered where everyone put their coats since I seemed to be the only one wearing one of those too. I expected “dress for a job interview” but it seemed like most people were dressed in casual attire that you would wear to dinner. They only specified that we couldn’t wear hats, tanks, shorts, or jeans. There was also a sign on the door that said men had to tuck in their shirts. But nobody went really above “just don’t be a slob” except for me who looked like a lawyer haha. 

**WAITING**
We sat in the room for almost exactly one hour before the judge entered. Pretty much everyone had a book or scrolled on their phones. I brought my iPad to see if I could get work done, but the room was so quiet that I was too weirded out to make any typing sounds so I just stared at my phone wishing I remembered to bring a book instead. 

 **THE JUDGE** 
The judge entered the court room after an hour of waiting and he was super chill. Didn’t make us stand up or do anything weird. He talked to us like a normal dude. He told us that he was a substitute however so it might be different if he was the “real” judge. He explained that they summoned us today to choose juries for three cases, but two of them had settled that morning which is why we were waiting for an hour. He said that the third case was still working out if they would settle or not and we would probably know within the next hour. He told us to hang tight and we were allowed to leave the courtroom to go to the bathroom and whatnot. We were allowed talk to other jurors, but he said to absolutely not talk to anyone else in the hall because they could be part of the case. They were also informed to not speak to us either. He answered a few questions and went on his way. One of the questions was about when the trial would be if it gets that far, and he said it would be chosen based on the availability of the jurors and lawyers and everyone who needed to be there. He said that this particular case would probably last a day and they usually schedule them on Fridays.

**MORE WAITING** 
After the judge left, the quietness lifted and people seemed to feel a bit more comfortable to chat with folks around them. This is when I went to the bathroom. But while I was in there, someone opened the door and shouted that we were all dismissed because that third case settled. I think it was a total of 5-10 minutes after the judge left the room.

**LEAVING** 
Of course they would dismiss us while I was in the bathroom so I was the only person who needed to go back in the courtroom to grab my shit while everyone else was leaving. There was a sign on the door that said to check with the clerk before leaving and when I did she looked at me like I was crazy— apparently everyone else just walked past her. 
I didn’t need to do anything else on the way out and that was it! I took my $20 (in cash!) and went to get a coffee and muffin and enjoyed my day off from work. 

**THINGS I LEARNED/WOULD DO NEXT TIME**
-I packed a backpack with my iPad, water bottle, small snack, notebook, and all the usual work junk I have in there. I probably didn’t need this and nobody else had anything bigger than a small purse. They let me take it through security no problem, but I really didn’t need it and it was just extra crap to schlep. I probably would have been happier with just a book. Maybe I would have felt differently if we all made it to voir dire. But I think I could have left it locked in my trunk since the location seemed safe enough to do so. 

-I really didn’t need to dress up for my summons and I looked sort of like a dork, so next time I’m just going to look “decent” but professional attire is definitely not a thing. 

-apparently most jury summons happens this way. You show up, sit for an hour while they settle the case in another room, and then when they settle, they let you go. So if you want a random $20 to sit in a room for an hour, just show up when you get a summons and it’s more than likely you’ll get let go super quickly. 

-one thing I didn’t know was that for district court they only choose eight jurors—six to sit with two alternates. So even if they did make it to voir dire, out of the ~40 summoned, most of us would still have gotten sent home. I wish I could say if they would have questioned all 40 randomly of us or went in order and dismissed along the way. 

And that’s pretty much it! I’ll try to answer any questions (no matter how small or silly you think it is) to the best of my ability. ",10,1743697416.0,juryduty,0,1.0,False

I’m a local Wall based software engineer working on a side project to help small business owners and professionals. I’m looking for people who have worked in or owned a small business (Ex. landscaping business, auto body shop, coffee shop, HVAC, yoga studio, laundromat, etc.)

The idea is simple: use your experience to help small businesses while earning passive income! No extra work—just sharing what you already know.

For example, if you’ve spent years working in a coffee shop, you know the ins and outs of running the business—what works, what doesn’t, and what it takes to be successful. My concept would let you share this knowledge in a new way with other coffee shop owners while earning passive income from your expertise. It’s a way to monetize what you already know about how a specific business is run.

If this sounds interesting (or you know someone who’d be a great fit), drop a comment or send me a message! Would love to hear your thoughts. Thank you!

Disclaimer: this is gonna be detailed, you might want to get a coffee 😊. This is really for experts because the EUSS rules can sometimes be ambiguous and I appreciate your expertise. I would like to ask a question about my EUSS status. I know that it has been asked many times, but each case is unique as you can realise. I am really tired of conflicting and misleading answers from the lawyers I dealt with, and the incompetence of the EUSS resolution centre.

**Long story short**:

* I am non-EU. I came to the UK in 2017 as a student, and I have been in a committed relationship with an EU citizen (who now has settled status) starting from 2018.
* I left the UK in 2019 (before Brexit) because of visa expiry. I came back again in 2021 and I had multiple visas (skilled worker, student, Tier 5).
* Last year (summer 2024), I applied for EU settlement scheme and I have recently received an approval as pre-settled. This was on the basis of “the durable partner of a relevant sponsor who joined after Brexit date”

**The usual question is: when does my 5-year residency start counting? :(**

I consulted two highly-rated lawyers, and called the EUSS resolution scheme, and trust me I got different answers. One claims that it will start from the date I was granted the pre-settled and that the previous residency under different visas do not count, one claims from the date of physically living in the UK, and one claims from the time that your relationship was deemed  durable, etc.

I tried for the first time to read the detailed caseworker guidelines instead of the general website of the Home office, and I found really interesting interpretations:

**- First**, in order for a durable partner to be considered as an eligible joining family member of a relevant sponsor, the case worker (Page 103) needs to be satisfied “ the partnership was formed and was durable before the specified date (Brexit date)” and that “the durable partnership remains durable at the date of application”.

**My interpretation**: as I was already granted pre-settled status recently as a joining family member, it means that the case worker believes that my relationship was durable before the Brexit date, because if it became durable after the Brexit date, I don’t think I would be eligible to apply in the first place.

**- Second**, to qualify for settled status after 5-year continuous residence the caseworker (Page 108): “you are satisfied, including by the required evidence of family relationship, that the applicant is the joining family member of a relevant sponsor” and “they have completed a continuous qualifying period of residence in the UK of 5 years which began after the specified date (Brexit date) as such a joining family member”

**My interpretation**: to be able to apply for settled status, I need first to prove that my relationship is still ongoing, and I need to complete 5 years of continuous residence AS A JOINING FAMILY MEMBER. Since I was considered as a durable partner before the Brexit date and my relationship is still ongoing, it means that since I moved back to the UK in 2021, I lived there as a joining family member.

**- Third**, an interesting statement in the caseworker guide (Page 103) says: “Where the applicant arrived in the UK as a joining family member and at that point had another form of immigration leave their continuous qualifying period of residence in the UK as a joining family member can include the period in the UK in which they held that other form of immigration leave.

**My interpretation**: my other visas that allowed me to live in the UK in 2021 can count towards my 5-year residence, because I was considered a joining family member at that time (given that the case worker assumed that my relationship was durable before the Brexit date).

So in summary, do you think I am right to assume that the lawyer who charged me 100 GBP for 20 mins was wrong when he told me that my 5-year residence start from the day I was granted pre-settled? Is my interpretation that my time in the UK in my case starts from the date I moved physically in 2021, because I was in a durable relationship already that begun before Brexit and remained till now?

Thank you for the help! Please let me know if you find my interpretations correct, and if yes, what can I say to the lawyer who gave me misleading information after charging me?

1jqmqr7,https://i.redd.it/3x54kcdoanse1.jpeg,Going to Germany gave me my life back” - from an interview from 2002 (translated by Tarja Turunen Suomi),"The original text in Finnish and the translation are [here](https://textsaver.flap.tv/lists/74qt?fbclid=PAY2xjawJbkXJleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABpiycnBPVW6xsur0Ld9X2c5IpRKKKnCdYM8Nx2XPkOoywIG71AtITn8mmQw_aem_DnHaB1ulXYnSTveqysuW0g).  

*Iltalehti 12.8.2002*  

**“Going to Germany gave me my life back""**  

*Nightwish’s frontwoman Tarja Turunen has always been the oddball of the opera world, even to the amount that sometimes her own brave choices bring difficulties to simple things. But now, after the first year of studying spent in Germany, things are flowing better than ever. Karlsruhe music university has gotten its rock star.*  
It is already a homey place, although there were shock situations for like six months. I would think, what have I done, sometimes I would cry and miss my mommy. I think that’s completely normal. Not many are totally chill about moving to live in another country, Tarja ponders.   

    
*Turunen still has practically speaking two years to finish her master's thesis, but the study pace is picking up and the upcoming year break from Nightwish is a necessity.*  
But this doesn’t mean the band would be on holiday for two years. People will hear about Nightwish during this time too and we’ll do concerts here and there, Tarja clarifies.    
The break was so needed. I was really sick all of last autumn and when it was looked into, it was discovered that working too much and stress had driven me to the point where my body just couldn't cope anymore. I needed to ease up the pace and now I also keep a better eye on what I eat. You need to take care of yourself, Turunen states with experience in her voice.  

    
*Taking care of practical matters in Germany has proven to be surprisingly complicated, but otherwise Turunen is more than happy with her decision to finish her studies in Karlsruhe.*    
Just opening an account is hard and you can’t get a bankcard you could pay with unless you have a million on your account. Student is quite a big curse word there and family values are respected. Highly educated women are at home. When I’ve told that in Finland both work, Germans have been horrified, that don’t fathers make enough money, Tarja smiles at the old-fashioned views.    
  
**“Germany is a good place to live”**    
  
Although I left for Germany with a sparkle of hope in my chest, I couldn’t have imagined how well people react to what I do. I couldn’t really find people in the same industry in Finland to talk to about things. I’ve gotten so much encouragement from the school and my own Japanese singing teacher thinks that of course I have to do Nightwish as well, Tarja rejoices, but elaborates that she is on same level as everyone else in the school when it comes to classical singing.     
Moving has brought back the positivity and light into life. It’s also freed me to music and interpretation. I again smile after the burnout. Taking some distance has been a good thing, Tarja adds.    

  
*Being in the core of Europe has felt so homey that Tarja is seriously considering moving to Germany, from where it would be good to dart around the world.*    
 I don’t consider it an impossible thought at all, that I’d stay in Germany or somewhere around there. It’s not a scary thought anymore, this is apparently doable. I suppose it would be the same six-month recovery even moving to Tampere, Tarja smiles and states the language barrier is quite big there too.    
Living in Germany is also so much cheaper, so it’s worthwhile. Companies are taxed more loosely, totally different than here. You’re always horrified by the price of a cup of coffee in Helsinki, Tarja tells with a shudder.    
  
**A brave stirrer of the classical deck**    
    
*Tarja coming to Karlsruhe music university has caused a buzz in the small town. The otherwise calm city has begun to receive boxes of fan mail and long-haired people wander around the school.*     
I’m a rock star there and I’m considered someone in that field. All of the school’s secretaries have been baffled when fan mail has started to show up. At first they wondered who on earth I was, but now they’re just feeling it.  

  
*In the beginning of summer Turunen did a small classical music tour in Argentina and Chile, countries Nightwish has already conquered. The positive feedback from the press and sold-out concert venues show that Tarja Turunen is hot stuff no matter what she’s singing.*     
The classical music reporters were also very impressed and interested. It was little weird, when in classical lied concert the audience is crying, shouting and screaming as in a rock concert, Turunen ponders happily.    
  

 Germans are a people of plastic suits and they make anything out of plastic. Finns are more fashion conscious, Tarja, who confesses on being a fan of shoes, thinks.    
    
 I’ve at least learned German punctuality in Germany, Tarja confesses.",8,1743697159.0,TarjaTurunen,1,1.0,False
