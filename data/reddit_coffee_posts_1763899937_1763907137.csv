1p4nngg,https://www.reddit.com/r/intermittentfasting/comments/1p4nngg/just_completed_my_first_effortless_36hour_fast/,Just completed my first EFFORTLESS 36-hour fast,"You guys. I'm so psyched. I just completed my first effortless 36-hour fast and I feel ah-mazing.

I’m posting this mainly for encouragement and to share a little hack that helped me ignore hunger pangs and actually enjoy the fast. For newbies: it's possible to go through a 36-hour fast and feel good ALL THE TIME, you just need a few things in place to prepare. 

I’ve been doing 18:6 and 16:8 for a while, and I’ve done OMAD. But any time I tried to go beyond 24 hours (like 36, 48, 52 hours) and fast overnight, in the morning I would feel faint, super weak, and a couple of times I even ended up vomiting. I honestly thought longer fasts weren’t for me cause I primarily want to feel good. Efforting is fine, but suffering is a big no for me.

This time was completely different. I feel awesome. My skin looks great, I feel lighter and slimmer. I don't want to check the scale yet -- it usually bums me out 🤣 I'll check it after I repeat this fast a couple of times.

I’m fasting mainly for health, not just weight loss. I don’t have that much to lose, but I do want to finally drop those last 5 kg that have been stubborn for like 10 years.

A bit of context: over the last few years I’ve really worked on making my life as peaceful and stable as possible. I’ve cut out a lot of unnecessary distractions and drama. During this fast I basically stayed home the whole time, which definitely made it easier. I imagine it could be harder if you’re out socializing or dealing with a very hectic schedule.

Also, I'm 32F, I'm in a great physical shape, I got my macros and hormones and menstrual cycles and supplementation figured out (and this has taken me YEARS). So I'm healthy and fit and feel good, I just want to lose those final 5kg and reach my goal weight for the first time since my teens.

Here’s what I did this time:

I started my fast at 1 a.m. on Friday and didn’t eat all Saturday.

I got hungry maybe 3-4 times. Every time I felt hunger, I turned on a stopwatch to see how long the hunger wave actually lasted.

Honestly, each wave was like 5 minutes. Then it faded, I got distracted, and I’d completely forget the stopwatch was even running.

That’s the main “hack” I wanted to share: treat hunger like a short wave and time it. Don’t react immediately. Just watch it. It passes much faster than it feels in your head.

How I supported the fast and prepped for it:

A couple of days before, I made sure to eat enough protein and fiber. I don't eat junk food, save for some chocolate here and there. 

During the fast I had only water and herbal tea and black coffee. 

I made sure to put Himalayan salt in my water, and I took magnesium.

I made sure to sip the salt water throughout the whole day and I also didn’t overdo the water amount in general because I didn’t want to flush everything out. Normally I drink around 4L a day; during the fast I think I was at around 3-4L.

I broke my fast pretty simply, no big refeed ritual or anything: Fish + rice + veggies + cheese + a probiotic.

I felt calm and peaceful the whole time. Sleep was good too, which is a big deal for me. I go to the gym regularly and if I don’t eat after training, I sometimes have trouble sleeping. Yesterday I didn’t work out, just went for a short walk, and it was totally fine.

I’ll update you all after my next 36-hour fast, because my plan is to do the next one while going to the gym as usual and see how my body responds.

Also, for context: I’m currently in my follicular phase, so this is a note to all the women here: it really helps to sync your fasting with your cycle and not push too hard during the wrong phase.

TL;DR:
Did my first effortless 36-hour fast and felt great THE WHOLE TIME. I prepped with good protein and fiber, used water/tea/coffee/salt/magnesium during the fast, and broke it with fish, rice, veggies, and a probiotic. My biggest tip is the stopwatch hunger hack: when you get hungry, time the hunger wave instead of reacting to it. For me it lasted about 5 minutes each time and then passed. Fasting almost effortlessly is definitely possible if you prepare a bit and set up the right conditions. You don’t need years of prep work, just a few key things done right.

I’ll update after my next 36-hour fast when I include regular gym sessions.

I’m also really curious to hear about other people’s experiences with 36-hour (or longer) fasts, especially how you handle hunger and energy + results you got! ",1,1763907052.0,intermittentfasting,0,1.0,False

We are all convinced that the best ways to be are busy, distracted, and inebriated. Keep your head down, keep hustling, scroll and compare your life to another's, and rely on a vice to bury your fears and sadness. All of that, paired with the fact that we are encouraged to focus on our individual selves, is a recipe for a crisis, be it physical, mental, and/or spiritual. We are social animals and should be able to connect with each other more consistently. However, as many people point out, it is incredibly difficult to connect with another person. There is always a barrier: trauma, personalities, philosophies, perspectives, etc.

  
But there is no better time than now to slow down. And while there is a screen between us, we have the opportunity to connect.

1p4nm17,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1p4nm17,From Vegan To Raw Meat,"Hello dear raw meaters! 
I’ve been around the block as they say. 
I stopped abusing substances around the beginning 2019. 
Then spirituality became a means to find balance. 
It’s interesting because this period I had two major relationships, and in retrospect I can say it was more of a shared experience of compatible traumas from what I was unraveling into with of course some deep shared emotions. 

Around 2024 if cut of many things, including meat, sex and even coffee just wouldn’t work well with me. Fasting had been a big part of my life and 48 to 36 hour fasts where allmost a fortnight thing, with the daily 16 to 19 hour fasts.

I was working as a bartender at the time and had decided to go on a two week fast mid December. It didn’t feel like I got much out of this. 
During my fast I felt so aligned, my meditations, prayers, breathing exercises and dreams were all profound. 

Hit March and my body just didn’t want food, so I at less and felt better and it turned out to be an intuitive fast.

I was working at the time and I didn’t want anyone to know. I was fasting as I didn’t wanna be treated differently.
Two weeks into the fast, my employer and Friend is quite intuitive and sharp, noticed that my energy wasn’t the same.
I couldn’t deny and lied to him, so I decided to take time off work.
This was around the lent period as I found out at church. I decided I’ll go for 40 days and the experience now I could say it was probably one of the most profound journeys in finding something deeper.

Around the 20th day, I was craving blood, which made absolutely no sense to me at the time and I was afraid to share this with people.

Also, I suffered from Crohn’s disease. I had severe acne on my back. 
And coming back from my fast, which something in me, my dreams and that voice that I had to obey kept telling me to break my fast on the 33rd day.

As I was somewhat of a vegetarian and a vegan before starting my fast, I was having more puréed veggies and somewhat some animal broth.

Long story short and I know this isn’t a long story lol…. But some more meat I ate better I felt.

I was on somewhat of a keto diet, which felt OK. But every time I ate just meat, my energy my focus, and my spiritual alignment never felt so powerful.
I went from eating meats, to fresh meats that are grass fed, and then on the occasional raw meats and this was all me following those signs that allowed this bodies tuning to become more precise and functional.

Now all I can eat is raw meat, I no longer have Crohn’s disease, my pack for the first time in 34 years is completely clear, my energy is so focussed that I move through life so swiftly as though time has no effect on me. 

Come to think of it, my mum would make little kofte’s and I would hid and eat them raw as a kid. 
I’m finally eating as I’ve always wanted to, I don’t follow time or number, I follow how I feel in my life has improved in ways that I could possibly express through texts.

Nagsabi na ako sa parents ko na hindi na ako uuwi muna tuwing weekend sa last weeks prior sa exam para makapag lock-in. Pero ang totoo ay dahil alam kong magiging emotionally unstable ako habang papalapit yung exam at ayokong makita nila yon. May meals naman dito sa boarding house pero tuwing sunday ay wala. Kaya minessage nila ako na kumain sa labas at huwag magtipid. Kilala kasi nila ako na sobrang tipid at kung saan-saan lang kumakain. 

Buong araw, sobrang nanlalata ako magreview dahil lagari ako magreview nung mga nakaraang araw. Parang nagsha-shutdown na rin ako sa pressure na parang ang dami ko pang aaralin at onti na lang yung oras na natitira. Gusto kong magpahinga pero nasasayangan ako sa oras. At ayan nga, nagchat si mama kung ano raw ba ipapabili ko sa grocery at kung may ipapadala raw ba ako dahil sila na lang pupunta sa akin. Onti lang yung sinabi kong bilhin dahil sapat naman na yung baon na binigay nila at bibili na lang ako kung may gusto o kailangan pa ako.

Pagdating nila, ineexpect ko na plastic bag lang yung ibibigay sa akin at akala ko yang box ay grocery nila sa bahay. Pero yan yung binigay saken. Pigil na pigil yung luha ko habang kaharap ko pa sila. Pagpasok ko sa kwarto ko binuksan ko na yung box at di ko na napigilan na umiyak (hanggang ngayon na tinatype ko to naiiyak pa rin ako HAHAHAHAHA) Nagtrigger ng luha ko yung midgets ng mister donut at piattos, na gusto ko pero di ko binibili kasi tinitipid ko nga yung baon ko. I always think na si mama nga yung parang angel ko rito sa lupa na kapag may gusto ako pero pinagkakait ko sa sarili ko, nasisense nya yun kaya out of no where binibigay nya kahit hindi ko hingin. Lord, tulungan niyo po akong ipanalo tong exam. Para po sa kanila 'to.

Haist sorry ang babaw pero kailangan ko lang i-share to kasi ang emotional ko today sinabayan pa ng period shuta HAHAHAHAHAHA okie lagari na ulit

Basically a week after today when social club events open again I'm going to initiate conversation asking him if hes going to join another society club together.

If it goes well I'm going to ask if he wants to grab coffee in the city with me? (i'm stuck on this bit cause hes a mega introvert and I don't even know if he goes outside but I don't think he'd be comfortable if I invited him over to game at my place cause we're not that close).

Now we spiral. Enter the guilt. Enter the feelings of nothing bringing joy, everything feeling like a heavy burden of existing.

I want to scream, cry, and disappear into the woods all at once.  Nothing feels okay and everything makes me cry but objectively? Things are good. I am okay. But the rage, the struggle, the inner feeling is so strong I just can’t shake it.

Just needed to vent. To not feel so alone. Solidarity to everyone here, I’m sorry we’re in this togethe",1,1763906506.0,PMDD,1,1.0,False

So something funny happened today. I was at a café in Delhi just enjoying my coffee when the couple next to me suddenly started arguing about “where this relationship is going.”
Meanwhile I’m sitting there like a peaceful NPC, sipping my cold brew, trying not to make eye contact.

But the best part?
The guy looks at me mid-fight and goes, “See? Even he looks more sorted than us.”

Bro… I literally came here because Swiggy forgot my order and I didn’t want to cook. 💀

Walking back I realised — early 20s me thought by 30 I’d have everything sorted out: career on track, relationship stable, long-term plans, maybe even a plant that’s alive.
Current me? Thriving… kinda. Figuring things out… mostly.
Single… apparently very visible.

Anyway, does anyone else sometimes feel like they’re doing life right and wrong at the same time?

1p4ne61,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1p4ne61/the_east_wing_of_st_michaels_just_turned_its/,The East Wing of St. Michaels Just Turned Its Cameras Back On,"# Chapter One: The Hospital

It was a quiet night at the ICU at St. Michaels Medical Centre, Plympton, Massachusetts. The hallways were deserted, doctors running on caffeine and the promise of a salary. The hospital opened in 1937, originally as the biggest hospital in the region, but in 1985, management decided that the hospital had too high a capacity, with only about a quarter of the facilities getting regular usage.

Shortly after, the east wing was abandoned and sealed to lower costs and capacity. The equipment was left untouched, as it was nearly impossible to sell and it would be too much of a hassle for management.

In thirty-two-year-old Jeff Peterson’s room, the clock had just struck 2:47 AM. The lights were off, and Jeff was in deep sleep.

Too deep.

Shortly after, his pulse got slower and slower, until suddenly, on the 4th of August 2032, at 2:53 AM, after a long battle with brain cancer, his heart stopped beating for good.

On-call nurse Samantha Reeds rushed into the room. The lights flicked on in an instant, and she immediately started chest compressions and the defibrillator. Nothing happened. He was still flatlining.

At 2:57 AM, Jeff Peterson was officially pronounced dead by the ward manager, Samantha Reeds.



# Chapter Two: Jeff Peterson

Jeff had an average childhood. He grew up in Charlestown, a little seaside town in Rhode Island, with his mom and dad. Like most, he graduated high school, went to college, got a job, and lived happily until he was around thirty years of age.

Jeff’s dad, Peter, had a heart attack and didn’t make it. This was incredibly tragic for Jeff; his dad was his hero, his everything, his fishing buddy. But just like that, he was gone.

Jeff was depressed, but luckily, his dad had taught him one important thing for situations like this: “Drop it and move on.” And so Jeff did. It wasn’t easy, but after a few months of depression, he got his life back on track and lived with those words in the back of his mind.

One day, Jeff felt nauseous. Maybe it was something he had eaten; he couldn’t know for sure. One thing he did know, though, was that work was cancelled today.

A little later, Jeff started throwing up and dry heaving every couple of minutes. Later that day, he got a stabbing headache, the most painful of his life. He could barely bear it, so he called his mom, Katie, so she could drive him to St. Michaels Medical Centre.

They passed the abandoned wing, but Jeff couldn’t focus on it; he could only keep his eyes closed and try to ignore the pain. Katie, however, gave it a little thought. She had heard rumours about how the wing was haunted, but she didn’t buy any of it. She was too intelligent for that.

Jeff presented to the emergency room and described his symptoms to the admitting nurse.

Samantha Reeds.

Jeff was booked for room 013, and Doctor Kyle Johnson entered shortly after.

“Hello, my name is Kyle, and I will be the one examining you today,” Kyle said enthusiastically, reaching out for a handshake.

Jeff returned it, forcing out an obviously painful “Hello.” He began describing his symptoms again to the doctor. Kyle was suspecting food poisoning when suddenly Jeff’s vision started going blurry, his speech slurred, and his muscles contracted.

Jeff was suffering a seizure.

Luckily, he was already at a hospital, and the staff was prompt to stabilise him. Jeff was put to sleep, and he woke up around 6 AM the next day. His headache had remained, and it was only getting worse.

The doctors decided to send him for a CT scan, and what they found was shocking: a tumour lodged deep in his brain. Jeff was diagnosed with brain cancer. His battle for survival lasted only a few months, and we are left back at the ICU at the west wing of St. Michaels Medical Centre.



# Chapter Three: The Blackout

Immediately after Jeff flatlined, a quick blackout lasting only a fraction of a second happened hospital-wide. The lights flickered, life support machines stopped for a moment, and it gave a little jolt to everyone in the building. The blackout lasted only a split second, but the silence afterward was wrong.

Too heavy.  
Too aware.

In the early 2000s, management decided to install motion sensors and cameras in the east wing in case any urban explorers got ideas. Since then, absolutely nobody had been inside the east wing. The airtight door, which had a little round window, had been bolted shut, and there were no recorded instances of any life.

The on-duty security guard, Mike Williams, was in the security booth, wishing he had become a police officer. But after failing the entry requirements, he was stuck watching security cameras and doing rounds every hour.

In the security room, the west wing CCTV screens were always on, but the screens for the east wing were kept off since there was no point in actively watching them. They still recorded to a hard drive, though. This meant half the screens in the room were constantly lit, while the other half were dark.

Mike had just come back from a patrol round; nothing was out of the ordinary. He was about to pour himself a mediocre cup of coffee and grab a stale doughnut when he heard the unmistakable *click* of a screen turning on.

He turned around, and what he saw startled him.



# Chapter Four: The East Wing

The screens for the east wing CCTV had suddenly flicked on, showing the current date and time.

Mike was flabbergasted. In his twenty years as a guard at this place, he had never seen those screens on.

“The hell?” Mike muttered quietly.

There were about thirty total camera feeds, most focused on hallways and wards. Feed #23 was a hallway camera, but it was oriented to look into room 013 of the old ICU.

Mike noticed something strange: a humanoid, shadowy figure, impossibly tall—maybe two and a half meters—was not exactly moving around the room, but gliding. After about fifteen seconds, the figure floated out of sight, heading toward the upper corner to the right of the door.

Mike summoned the ward manager, Samantha, and the hospital director, Richard Caldwell. He told them what he’d seen, stumbling over his words. At first they stared at him like he’d finally snapped after twenty years of night shifts.

But when he replayed the footage from camera #23, neither of them said a word.

Richard swallowed, looked at Samantha, and said, “Alright. We’re going.” He tried to sound in control. He didn’t.

Samantha and Richard made their way toward the east wing, the echo of their footsteps following them like something was just one step behind.

The door to the east wing should’ve been bolted shut, sealed since the early 2000s, but the bolts were gone. Richard hesitated, then pushed it open. Cold, stale air spilled into the hallway like the building had just exhaled after years of holding its breath.

They stepped inside.

About ten meters in, Samantha turned around and froze. The door they had just walked through was now shut.

Bolted.  
From the inside.

She didn’t say anything. Richard didn’t either. They both knew there wasn’t any way back.

They continued down the hallway, passing rusted machinery, abandoned beds, old monitors with cracked screens, everything buried under years of dust. Every door they passed was shut, sealed tight by time and neglect.

Except one.

The door to room 013 stood wide open.

Mike watched their flashlights on the monitors, listened to their breathing crackle through the radios. The camera couldn’t see inside from its angle, but he heard the shift in their voices the moment they stepped inside.

The bed was made.

The sheets were clean. Straightened. Like someone had just gotten up.

Samantha approached slowly. When she rested her hand on the mattress, she flinched.

It was warm.

A wristband lay on the pillow. She picked it up, and in the dim beam of her flashlight, she read the label:

**Jeff Peterson — Time of Death: 2:57 AM, 4/8/2032**

Before she could fully process the name, the lights across the entire hospital snapped off again.

Total blackout.

Mike cursed and slapped the console, but the screens were dead. Nothing but black reflections stared back at him.

Fifteen seconds later, the backup generators kicked in. The monitors flickered back to life.

The hallway was empty.  
Room 013 was empty.  
The radios were silent.

And the door to the east wing, the one that had opened so easily, was now sealed shut from both sides.

I apologised for everything and took a lot of accountability - ive been seeing a therapist since and i came to a lot of the same conclusions about my actions during the relationship. You could tell he was pretty shocked by this i think k. We then left and hugged and he said it was a lot to process atm and he texted me afterwards again to say it was a lot to process but glad to talk etc. that was last week and i havent heard back from him again.

one of my regulars finally told me straight up few weeks ago - your instagram is all over the place, I can never remember to check it

that hit me hard.

I was spending 3-4 hours every week making social posts and window signs. hired someone on fiverr once for $150, used canva templates, made stuff myself. whatever looked decent I posted.

problem is nothing matched. one week bright and colorful, next week dark and moody. my window signs looked like 3 different businesses. I thought I was keeping things fresh but I was just confusing people.

if a regular customer can't recognize my brand, new customers definitely can't. probably lost business because people walked by and didn't realize we had new drinks or specials.

the time cost was killing me too. 3-4 hours a week is basically a part time job just for marketing. and I'm terrible at remembering what colors or fonts I used before so every post started from scratch.

tried writing down brand guidelines once. wrote warm and cozy and specialty coffee vibe then sat there at midnight staring at canva like ok now what.

can't afford a full time designer and honestly even if I could I'd probably mess it up cause I'd be the one telling them what to make.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

The autumn hiking season is in full swing, and the weather forecast for the 29th looks absolutely perfect. We’re excited to head over to Kyoto for a trail that mixes history, mythology, and some of the best views in the Kansai region.

# November 29th: Daimonji-yama & The Philosopher's Path Loop ⛰️

We are heading to the famous Daimonji-yama!

# What it will be like

For those new to Kyoto hiking, Daimonji is the mountain with the massive ""大"" (Dai) character burned into it during the Obon festival. We are taking a slightly less traveled route up the ""back side"" of the mountain.

We'll pass by the cave linked to the mythology of the Sun Goddess Amaterasu hiding away and plunging the world into darkness (we'll explain the story on the trail!). Once we reach the summit, we’ll get a panoramic view of the entire Kyoto basin.

After lunch at the top, we’ll head down the front side. Since we are doing a loop this time, we’ll catch the southern end of the historic Philosopher's Path and the Nanzen-ji area before finishing up right where we started.

# The Weather ☀️

We checked the forecast, and we really couldn't ask for better hiking weather.

* **Forecast:** Mostly Sunny
* **Temp:** High of 16°C (61°F) / Low of 6°C (43°F)
* **Wind:** Light breeze

**Difficulty:** ★★★☆☆ (9.6km, 600m elevation gain. Approx 4 hours hiking time + breaks) **Views:** ★★★★★ (One of the best spots to see the Kyoto cityscape) **History:** ★★★★☆ (Mythological caves and historic canals)

# When and where we'll start

We will gather from **10:00 to 10:30**, and we will leave at **10:30 sharp**.

**Meeting Point:** We are meeting at [Keage Station](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cafe+Keage+Akaribasan/@35.0080773,135.7870977,17z/data=!4m23!1m16!4m15!1m6!1m2!1s0x6000e68d184cbfed:0xcddcd36b1d3ff7b9!2sUmeda,+Kita+Ward,+Osaka,+530-0001!2m2!1d135.4957339!2d34.7005588!1m6!1m2!1s0x60010920aba13803:0x107b91c50db20558!2sKeage+Sta.,+Higashikomonozach%C5%8D,+Higashiyama+Ward,+Kyoto,+605-0044!2m2!1d135.7901846!2d35.0082071!3e3!3m5!1s0x600109f4e846b487:0x28723b1b2ae6f399!8m2!3d35.0080774!4d135.7904006!16s%2Fg%2F11vl0l7z2g?entry=ttu&g_ep=EgoyMDI1MTExNy4wIKXMDSoASAFQAw%3D%3D) (Tozai Line) just outside **Exit 1**.

* *Train details:* From Umeda/Osaka, it takes about 53 minutes and costs roughly ¥1,100 each way. You will likely need to transfer once (usually at Karasuma Oike) to get to the Tozai line.

# Lunch & Food 🍙

**Important:** There are **no convenience stores** near the meeting point at Keage Station. Please buy your lunch and snacks **before** you get on the train or during your transfer. We will be eating our packed lunches at the summit while enjoying the view.

# After the Hike ☕

We plan to finish the loop back at Keage Station. For those who have time, we’re planning to stop at the **Keage Cafe** right next to the station to rest our legs, grab a coffee, and chat before heading home.

# What you'll need

* **Water:** Please bring **at least 1 liter** of water. Even in cool weather, this trail has some elevation and hydration is key.
* **Lunch:** As mentioned, bring it with you!
* **Footwear:** Hiking boots are recommended, but comfortable sneakers are okay if you don't have them.
* **Clothing:** 16°C is comfortable while moving, but the summit can be breezy. A fleece or light layer to put on while we eat lunch is highly recommended.
* **Hiking Poles:** Not required, but they always improve stability. Bring them if you have them! We also have a limited number to lend out.

# Other stuff

As always, this event is completely free and everyone is welcome—solo hikers, first-timers, and regulars alike.

**Safety Note:** We take safety very seriously. We choose locations where chances of wildlife encounters are low, but we always carry appropriate safety gear and deterrents as a precaution. We want everyone to feel safe and relaxed on the trail!

Leaving a comment or a PM if you plan to come helps us know who to look out for, but you are also welcome to just show up at the station. Expect to hike with people from all over the world. 

See you on the trail! 🍁",2,1763905700.0,thisisosaka,0,1.0,False

The world is soft and gray. A cool morning chill is in the air. Your thoughts are still fuzzy, floating. The day hasn't really begun yet. The gentle sound of coffee brewing. You open the cupboard and your hand finds it—the one. The mug that feels just right. You feel its comforting weight. The sound of hot, dark coffee pouring into the ceramic is the first real note of the day's song. You wrap your hands around the mug, and a gentle warmth spreads through your fingers, chasing away the chill. You lift it, and the rich aroma of coffee envelops you. You take the first sip. And in that moment, the world sharpens. The day begins. It's a small, perfect sanctuary, just for you.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

I’m pretty new to Bangalore and have been staying in Indiranagar for just a couple of weeks now.

Got a few initial responses but the chats didn’t really go anywhere, so I ended up heading out and exploring on my own today — and honestly had a good time.

Stopped by **Anama Café** for a coffee (amazing vibe), and then checked out **The Jungle Floor** vinyl store — ended up picking a couple of cool records.

I brew my moka, while it’s going I also boil some water.

I use a stick blender to froth that (I bought a milk frother for myself but I can’t
Open it til Xmas)… then I add cinnamon on top and 1/2tsp of dandy tea (dandelion root powder- it’s a coffee alternative and a good prebiotic but I also just like the taste it adds to coffee). Then I pour my brewed moka ontop of the milk froth mixture, and then fill my mug (I use a large one) to the top with hot water to dilute everything so it tastes more mellow (I don’t like super strong coffee). Dash more cinnamon on top. Sometimes a tiny dash of real salt. 

Wondering who here will think this is good and who will claim that I’ve ruined coffee :)

1p4mzbg,https://www.reddit.com/r/getdisciplined/comments/1p4mzbg/what_would_you_do_as_a_30_years_old_virgin/,What would you do as a 30 years old virgin?,"Hello everyone, I have never used Reddit much, but I recently searched about people in their 30s who are still virgins and found many topics and stories about their struggles. I want to share my story as well. I won't share too much personal stuff about myself, I am from a poor country that moved to the west, 1.84m, blonde hair with dark shades, blue eyes and fit body type ( I used to be skinny fat ).

In my 20s, I was a virgin and struggled with the same issue. People told me to focus on myself, improve my life, and make friends. I had two or three friends back home and I was happy with that. I did not feel like a loser, but in women’s eyes I was considered one. So I began working on myself. I moved from a poorly developed country to a better one in the West to start a new life. I worked my way up, found better job opportunities, and by 30 I secured a very good remote job. I also started part time security work, which helped me meet many people and make friends. It also motivated me even more to be more fit in the gym. I built muscle and began eating properly. 

During my time in the West, I made many more friends, couples, families, and people I go out with every weekend. I meet new women regularly and I have received many numbers, but nothing ever developed beyond friendship. I often hear, “You’re attractive, but I don’t see you as more than a friend,” or, “I’d like to go out for coffee, but not dating.”

Now that my life is more stable, even though it was a long struggle to completely change my environment, I feel it was the right choice. I want to understand how women think. What I realised is that many women do not like “good guys.” I started researching what women actually want, and it seems many prefer men who are colder, more confident, and more mysterious. They are less interested in men who are an open book or too easy to read. They lose interest quickly and can sense desperation. I know not all women are like this, but from what I have seen, many are. Even if a woman acts differently at first, over time she may lose interest if you always agree with her and act like the nice guy.

So my new approach began. I have been using dating apps, approaching women in real life, asking for numbers, asking them out, and dealing with rejection and ghosting. In the past two months I have been rejected many times, which for me feels like a game and I'm not taking it personal. I have noticed more compliments from women, especially older women who are more direct. At my part-time job, there are women who give me persistent looks, and one even found me on Instagram and invited me out for drinks. The only issue is that she is not my type. She is overweight, which is fine in this time and age, but since I am very committed to the gym, I would like a partner who is healthy and active with me.

At 30, I have learned to be more nonchalant, colder, and more mysterious, and to avoid sharing too much about my life, just make them guess. I still have a lot to learn, but this approach seems to work better. I have only been doing this for the past four or five months, so it is still a work in progress.

My current issue is that I am still a virgin at 30. I can see progress in how women react to me, but I am questioning what I actually want. Do I want a partner, or do I just crave sex for now? Two women have shown interest in me, but I am not attracted to them. I would prefer someone more fit. I am comfortable being alone, but I crave the sexual experience, especially because my friends constantly talk about it. I am putting more effort into becoming more mysterious and learning more about women, but recently the sexual urge has been very strong. I am about to turn 31 and I have never even kissed a girl.

This leads to the thought of hiring an escort just to clear my mind. The desire distracts me at work and affects my performance on daily basis, let it be work or my improvement with women. So my question is:

1.Should I wait longer, keep improving myself, and hope to have my first sexual experience with someone random I meet in a nightclub or on a dating app ? ( Been trying the past months, but it's been ghostings from them or breadcrumbing me ) 

2.Should I hire a professional escort which I find attractive to get it over with and regain my focus on work, self-improvement, and becoming better with women, with the hope of eventually finding the right partner for a long-term relationship?

3.Should I lose my virginity to one of the women I met at work, even though they are not my type and may want a long-term relationship, which I do not reciprocate because the attraction is not mutual? ( And they say to not shit where you sleep ) 

I know that women can sense my frustration even though I try to control it and hide it. My discipline has been strong this past year, but the biological urge is difficult to manage, I am aware sex is not not a human need like water is, but it can mess with your brain no matter how hard you try to control it, I've been doing it for half my life so I know the struggles as many of you might as well.",0,1763905233.0,getdisciplined,5,0.5,False

as I sink into this deflating mattress,

I sink into the night where we first met,

the truth of what happens when my body touches the ground pains me,

i will wake.

why do all of my dreams arrive forever late?

The music filling my thoughts vanished. An action I don’t believe my words were worthy or guilty of. I take out my headphones, although my Walkman is empty.

“Chance, you have bipolar disorder, not ‘My legs don’t work’ disorder,” said my best friend Will. He removed his beanie by throwing it onto his dashboard. Will never missed out on the chance of showing his long golden hair. The chance’s name today was Margo, or maybe Marie.

Recalling names requires improvement.

Will put his car into park. “We’re going next week. All of us. You with your crossed up wires, Andy with his polka dot kissed face, and Sara with her elf ears and nose.”

“Dude, screw you,” Sara said from the back. She had been laughing, but she still gave Will’s seat a solid kick. Sara had those features, but she never wanted anyone to speak it. “If we’re all messed up, what’s your feature?”

Will smiled in the mirror and said, “I’m the driver.”

“The reckless driver,” said Andy through his face mask.

“Sorry, couldn’t hear you, did you say the sickest driver?” Will laughed at his own joke.

“I don’t see why we have to do it next week.” I said while flicking the ends of my pilot hat. Winter and I had a very complicated relationship. I was born in February. So, I should enjoy it. But I hate the cold. No, maybe not the cold itself. I hate the feeling of being cold.

The kind of cold where it hurts to breathe and when you do breathe all you can think about is not being cold any longer.

The winter is when I gained life, but the older I became, the more I realized it gave me everything opposite of such.

“We must do this during the upcoming week since graduation is finished; we are now college freshmen, including one freshwoman, and this is our initial winter with no outside instruction.” He took out his key and placed it in his pocket. “But first we are going to meet Mira and her friends.”

Mira.

We misfits exited the pale blue Civic and sighed. Cold but not unbreathable cold. My fingerless gloves (self done by me) were already touched by snow as we walked into the local coffee shop.

Our little group lived in the suburbs of Hilliard, Ohio.

Was it boring?

Yes.

Was it draining?

Yes.

Did we love it?

Yes.

It was ours, and we were its, and together our friendship had grown into a powerhouse. Everyone knew Will, which meant everyone knew me, and everyone who knew me, may have known Andy, and those who may have known Andy, didn’t know Sara.

However, regardless of our relationships, the four of us remained inseparable.

“Yo, Will!” said Steve. He owned the coffee shop because his parents owned the coffee shop. During high-school, Steve had been the main cashier in the small room where students purchased unhealthy snacks that weren’t sold in the main lunch line. Steve would always let us get cookies for free, a trend that followed him to the present. He pulled back his long hair, giving his sharp nose and puffy red eyes more light. “Your coffees have already been served, Mira has them at the table.”

“Thank you,” said Will, he and Steve were friends before I had been friends with Will, and I had been friends with Will since we were ten. “How’s your mom doing?”

“She’s doing wonderful,” said Steve with a laugh, “her and my dad are going to LA for the winter. They don’t want any time spent in the blizzard that’s brewing.”

“I don’t blame them,” said Will. He removed his coat and placed it on the rack.

I removed my coat and placed it under his. Andy placed his under mine, and Sara kept on her coat. I followed Will to the table. Andy followed me, and Sara followed him.

Three misfits, no more, were present when the public observed the four of us.

I slid into the booth across from Mira. Will sat next to Mira, and Andy sat next to him. Sara slowly analyzed the seat, and then the table, and then the coffee cups, and then the floor, and then the seats again, “Sara,” I said. “It’s fine. You can sit.”

Sara nodded and said, “Thank you.” With a deep inhale of courage, she sat in the booth with me. The dark brown sleeve of her leather sleeve pushed into my arm. I don’t believe Sara knew how close she was to me. She was too busy analyzing her surroundings, and when she is doing such, she does not care for those around her. We don’t even show up in her line of sight. All she cares about are the things, not the people.

“Sara,” I said as I grabbed my coffee. It’s too hot for me too drink but warm enough for me to hold.

“Sorry,” she said. Though she wasn’t sorry. Because as a group we had told her years ago there was nothing for her to be sorry about.

“So, Will, are we going or not?” asked Mira as she leaned into him. She sounded like a mistake.

Not a mistake that ruined lives.

But the kind of mistake where someone uses the wrong tool for wood shop. Like if I used a hammer on a screw on a brick. Mistakes that wouldn’t ruin your life but would never take you anywhere for long.

“We are going,” said Will, he drank his coffee, which wasn’t really coffee but a means of ignoring the sour reactions us misfits had for his answer. “One entire week of nothing but snowboards, trees, hot chocolate, and the songs of love.”

“Oh, I can’t wait,” said Mira. She was not like the other girls Will had spent his time with. She was the first to have dyed hair, pierced eyes, and a smile that didn’t scream, ‘I LOVE IDIOTS.’

Brain, you are being too impolite.

“Your friends are still coming, right?” asked Will as he finished the coffee that was not really coffee.

Mira smiled at me and said, “Yeah, of course they are. We’ve been talking about it for weeks. They can’t wait to meet your friends.”

Sara ticked in a way that was aggressive and fearing. She was angry, she was angry that she had been scared.

“Yeah,” said Andy less mockingly than I would have. “What did you tell them that would have them so eager to meet us? Did you tell them about my skin condition? About Chance’s bizarre mind? Sara’s fear of unseen attackers?”

“I told them you were friends with Will,” Mira said, either because she didn’t care or was too out of it to think, “and if Will trusts you, you can’t be all that bad.”

Her answer would have been better if she had just said yes to Andy’s question.

Will being Will, read the responses on our faces before he tried to change the subject. Placing his arm around Mira, he easily relaxed, stating “They aren’t just my friends. And Andy, she’s met Chance before, and he likes her, right?”

This is the second question I hated most in the world.

The first being, ‘Are you okay?’

To lie or to truth, that was my endless dilemma in life. “Mira, you’re pretty exceptional. I know you didn’t mean it in a harming manner.”

“I’m pretty sure you said something like that last time,” said Mira.

I shook my head and darted my attention to those ordering. “I don’t think we’ve ever met.”

Mira showed me a very pleased smile and said, “Oh, so you’re the joker in the group.”

Someone’s leg brushed mine, and it had happened more than once. I was too distracted by Mira’s eyes to check who was in a game of footsies with me. “Sometimes they call me Loki.”

“Mischief and madness,” said Mira.

“More like madness and madness,” said Sara.

Four doors close and four misfits enter Andy’s home.

We always hung out at Andy’s place because it was his parents’ place. Will and I share a dorm room, and Sara lived in a dorm of her own. We went Andy’s because it had the most room and his parents weren’t the kind to hover over us.

Andy lived in the furnished basement with a stereo and TV. Which was more than my shared room with Will had.

Once we were all settled, Andy switched out his mask. His mask now was red and white, striped like a zebra.

Will turned on the stereo. “So, what did you two think of Mira?”

“She’s not your type,” said Sara. She checked her chair before sitting. After her fifth look over, she sat and crossed her legs.

“Which I believe is a good thing,” Andy said. He laid on his bed and added, “You need someone isn’t like the last ten girls you’ve dated.”

“That I do agree with.” Said Sara. “There’s no need for any more Amy’s.”

“Or Nina’s.”

“Pepper’s.”

“Lisa’s.”

“And definitely not anymore, Wendy’s.”

“Especially Wendy’s,” Andy and I said together.

“What was so wrong about Wendy?” laughed Will as he sat next to Andy.

“Dude,” I said between chuckles, “She pick-pocketed you, taking your keys and wallet, stole your car, drove it to Florida and then called you from Seattle to tell you she left your car behind with her ex-boyfriend.”

Will nodded, his lips shaped in various ways, then settled with a smile. “But she was freaking hot and did things none of the others had.”

“Yeah,” said Sara, “none of them stole from you.”

We all laughed and reminisced about the old romances of Will until the conversation shifted to plans for this coming weekend.

“So, who’s going to snowboard and who’s going to ski?” Asked Will.

I picked at the skin of my wrist beneath my watch. “I think I’m going with the board.”

“I’m going with skis.” Said Andy.

“And what about you, Sara?” Will asked. He took out a pack of gum and offered it to the rest of us.

Andy took a piece, moved his face from our eyes, and when he had the gum in his mouth, he covered his face then turned back to us. I took my piece of gum and gave the pack back to Will.

Sara shook her head, “I’m not doing either of those.”

“Come on, dude,” Will pleaded. “Don’t you want to enjoy yourself at least once? Think of the rush of shredding down the mountains. The chance to feel limitless.”

Sara looked up at Will, a small smile creeping onto her face. “Me, limitless? Dear Willy, don’t you know I am the opposition to the definition of limitless?”

Will smiled and shook his head a bit, chuckling quietly. “I didn’t forget, I just will never be the one to say you are limited.”

Sara and Will said nothing again. Their relationship was one built on pullback and baiting. Will baited Sara to be more, Sara pulled back on letting him believe he had succeeded.

I didn’t know which of the two would give up first. Will’s will was embers. Sara’s stone. To help mediate the room from becoming radio silence, I looked at Will and asked, “How long do you think it’ll take for Mira to steal your car?”

A smile broke out on Will’s face. He laughed and replied, “You know, I never thought about it!”

We spent hours again conversing about the trip and how now that it was official, we would all have to prep and pack. At the end of the hour, Sara stood from her seat. She stretched her legs and arms and looked at me when she finished and asked, “Want to walk me home?”

I stood up and rewound my Walkman. “Of course.”

“Stay warm, you two,” said Will. He looked ready for a nap.

“Ring me when you make it,” said Andy.

“Will do,” I said.

I then followed Sara upstairs and outside. I zipped my jacket to my neck. Put on my fingerless gloves and snugged my hat tighter around my ears.

Sara led the way. She ignored the wind as it pushed her braids through the air.

Luckily for us, mostly myself, Andy’s home was only a few blocks from the college.

“You aren’t limited by the way,” I said.

Sara scoffed and said, “Excuse me?”

“From earlier,” I replied. “You aren’t limited.”

Sara stopped in her tracks. “Look, Chance. There’s a difference between what I tell Will and what I tell you.” She placed her hands in her pockets. I watched her lips curve into a small smile. “I tell Will I can’t do things because he doesn’t like knowing I don’t want to do things. He thinks he has to fix the things that make us, us. He takes Andy to public places to make Andy feel less afraid of his appearance. He takes you on double dates in sunny places to remind you that neither love nor happiness is out of your reach. And he wants to take me to situations like snowboarding to show I can overcome my fears of the world.” Sara was no longer smiling. “Will needs to learn he can’t fix us because we aren’t broken.”

“You’re right,” I said as I watched the small cloud of my breath dissipate before landing on her face. “But I also know Will wants the best for us. He’s wired differently than the three of us, so he doesn’t see it the way you do.”

“Will isn’t different from us,” she said. “His disorder is out in the open for the world to see, and disorders such as his, mask themselves as normality amongst others.”

“What disorder does he have?”

“Look close enough, you’ll see it when you do.”

The walk ended at Sara’s dorm.

Before she went inside, she looked at my coat pocket and said, “Chrysophobia.” Sara removed my hat, placed it on herself, then vanished into the halls.

I sighed and walked to my dorm, sinking into the realization of my friend’s presumption. When I reached my shared room, my fear sat on my desk, waiting for me to either obey or to deny it. I picked up the orange bottle and stared at the white paper wrapped around its frame.

Xavier Shields.

Xavier Shields.

Xavier Shields.

Xavier Shields.

I read my name again and again, simply to delay the moment of my consumption of the bottle’s contents.

I thought about some of the most beautiful things I could think of to fill the time left until I had no choice but to drink the swallow the nulling medicine.

Without the pills, I am a wandering cloud in a burning storm.

With the pills, I am a fuzzy speck floating in the endless.

Tonight, I am a speck.

Tomorrow, perhaps I will be endless.

Smartphones and Ginkaku-ji, or On the Margins of Memory

This is a fictional essay inspired by the poetic worldview of WABISUKE. While the events and characters are imagined, it seeks to explore the quiet presence of memory within the landscapes of Kyoto.

Lately, whenever I visit Kyoto, I try not to look at my smartphone.
Of course, map apps are convenient, and it’s helpful to look up cafés or train times. But when everything becomes too convenient, I start to feel like the scenery in front of me is somehow distant—like it’s happening on a screen rather than in real life.
So today, I tucked my phone deep into my bag and decided to walk to Ginkaku-ji.

The Philosopher’s Path was as quiet as ever.
There were plenty of tourists, but everyone walked at their own pace.
The cherry trees along the canal had already shed their leaves, and the bare branches hinted at the coming winter.
I sat on a bench by the path and looked up at the sky.
Clouds drifted slowly overhead.
Their pace felt just right.

When I arrived at Ginkaku-ji, a group of foreign tourists were taking photos.
I heard English, French, and maybe Spanish.
I slipped past them and stood before the white sand garden.
The “Moon Viewing Platform” was still there, just as I remembered.
A mountain of sand, shaped to reflect the moonlight.
I had come here once before, at the end of the Showa era, with my father.
He’s no longer around, but I could almost hear his voice echo in my ears.

“That’s to reflect the light of the moon,” he had said.

I still remember those words.
And somehow, I can even recall the scent of the air that day.
Memory has a way of rising up across time, uninvited.
Like a needle dropping onto an old record, landing on a familiar song.

Standing before the Kannon Hall, I heard the soft clicks of camera shutters all around.
Everyone was trying to capture something.
But I just stood still and closed my eyes.
The sound of the wind, the birds, a child’s laughter in the distance—
That was enough.

Afterward, I walked toward Nanzen-ji.
Passing by Eikando, I noticed the autumn leaves were at their peak.
Crimson and amber leaves swayed gently in the breeze.
I thought about taking a photo, but decided against it.
Instead, I chose to etch the scene into memory.
Images held in the mind often last longer than those on a screen.
Even if they fade over time, their softness can be more deeply felt.

Climbing the Sanmon Gate at Nanzen-ji, I looked out over the city of Kyoto.
The ridgeline of Mount Hiei melted into the pale winter light.
I pulled a paperback from my coat pocket and flipped it open.
Virginia Woolf’s To the Lighthouse.
I’ve read it many times, but each time the flow of time feels different.
Perhaps it’s because my own memories keep shifting, little by little.

I stopped by Hōnen-in as well.
The patterns in the white sand altar had blurred slightly from the morning rain.
The way they blurred reminded me of memory itself.
Not quite clear, but undeniably there.
A Showa-era coffee shop, my grandmother’s low dining table, the voice of Yumi Matsutoya on the radio—
All of it still lingers faintly in the scenery of Kyoto.

As night fell, I stepped into a café near Demachiyanagi.
Old-fashioned cafés are rare these days, but this one had somehow survived.
Wooden chairs, a thick menu, coffee brewed with a flannel drip.
Behind the counter, the master quietly ground beans.
I sat by the window and ordered mint tea instead of a cigarette.
Times have changed, but the quality of quietness seems to have remained the same.

Outside, a young couple—probably university students—laughed over something on their phone.
Their laughter felt like it came from far away.
As I cupped the last warmth from my teacup in my hands, I thought:
Perhaps the Kyoto I once knew no longer exists.
But that’s okay.
The Kyoto in my memory still lives quietly within me.
The white sand of Ginkaku-ji, the gate at Nanzen-ji, the moss at Hōnen-in, the café in Demachiyanagi—
They have become the “margins” within me, still breathing softly.

On the way back, I walked along the Kamo River.
The surface of the water shimmered not with smartphone light, but with the glow of the city.
I slipped my hands into my pockets and walked slowly.
The wind had turned a little colder.
Winter must be near.
And yet, within me, the light of that afternoon at Ginkaku-ji still lingered, faint but warm.

1p4mx1d,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimNikah/comments/1p4mx1d/2_weeks_before_he_was_supposed_to_ask_for_my_hand/,"2 weeks before he was supposed to ask for my hand in marriage, he did this.. advice?","So about 4–5 months ago I posted here about the man who wants to marry me. We agreed to pause communication until he got a house and sorted his finances. Our parents were supposed to meet Dec 2025, and until then we’d only do a monthly phone call for updates or practical things (home preferences, admin, etc).

Since it’s almost Dec, we’ve been talking a bit more this past month because there were a lot of house updates. Two days ago he told me he was going to a cremation centre for the anniversary of a non-Muslim friend who passed (s*). He said he’d go to the gym afterward and then visit his parents. He came home at 3 in the morning (?) and texted me.

Yesterday my friend sent me videos she saw through his friends’ IG stories, which absolutely shocked me: him gaming with some woman and men in someone’s house in the livingroom… mixed group (men + women, all non-Muslim). Then another video of him dancing with them. Cake on the table. Caption: “Happy birthday.”

I called him and repeated his whole story: “Cremation centre → gym → parents?” He said yes. I asked again if he’d forgotten anything. No. Asked again. Still no. Then I asked why he was at a birthday party. He denied it. I sent the videos. Suddenly it became: “Oh, I told you we got coffee, and once I saw it got mixed I went home immediately.”

…Except there’s literally footage of him gaming with women… and another video an hour later of him dancing. “Immediately” is 30 seconds, not over an hour. How do you “accidentally” go to someones house where there are women as well, and game and dance with them?

I’m such an empath that my body instantly tries to make excuses for him. Meanwhile I haven’t slept or eaten in almost 48 hours because I keep shaking. Part of me wants to believe he didn’t mean it, that he’s just naive… and the other part of me is screaming: he’s almost 30. And this is the same man who gets irritated if I even mention a male coworker.

And this is what hurts the most. He’s the one who:

1.	⁠Doesn’t want to host game nights with my two best friends + their husbands because it’s “mixing.” Even though they would be accompanied with their mahram.
2.	⁠Got upset when a male coworker visited my parents’ home country and I said I could’ve given him tips. Should not have said that according to him.
3.	⁠Doesn’t want me at events where men + women mix unless it’s work-related.
4.	⁠Found it “weird” that I mentioned appreciating men covering their awrah in a beach post in a muslimcountry.

He always says, “I’m not forcing you, it just doesn’t align with my view of you and myself.”Claiming he avoids mixed spaces and feels uncomfortable around women. And honestly… I loved that about him. I want a man with those values. I looked up to that part of him. I have had depression for around 7 years now, so I leave the house like 1-2 times a month. And it has been like that for years. So I already had like 0,000 contact with other men, besides my coworkers. But he always did start arguments if I did happen to slip up, like I did when I asked my coworker why he hadnt asked me for tips. He painted an image of himself that he wouldnt even breath the same air of women, other than his coworkers.

So how is it not hypocritical that he polices me so hard, but then ends up in someone’s living room gaming and dancing with non-Muslim women literally 5cm from him? What else don’t I know? He told me “it wasn’t like that,” while we were both staring at the same videos. What else has he lied about this past year? Like did he do things like this often? Say he was having coffee with friends and then just go to houseparties like these? 💔

I feel lied to, gaslit, betrayed. Like I wasted a year.

Hasbunallah wa ni‘mal wakeel.

For context. He used to party in mixed groups. Got to coachella-ish festivals. He has many non-Muslim friends. He swore he’d left that behind. And because we aren’t supposed to pry into someone’s past, I let it go. But wallahi my gut always whispered something. And now, two weeks before everything was supposed to move forward… this.

I don’t know if this is shaitan trying to sabotage something that was meant to become halal… or Allah protecting me from a huge mistake.

I feel so lost. I prayed and prayed and prayed, and I’m still numb. There was a plan. A path. And he just threw it away.

I ended the call saying I was done. He sent one message: “I’m sorry.” Nothing else. And honestly… that told me everything. He is not even trying to get me to talk to him, let alone fight for our future and fix his mistake. It feels like he got caught and said well okay bye next. I feel like a fool. I saved myself for almost 28 years for the right one, only to end up here.

May Allah show me the khayr in this one day. 🤲🏼

This was long and messy (sorry), more like a diary entry. But no one in my life knows about him, and I needed it off my chest. I just want to know… am I overreacting? Or is this Allah protecting me? I’m trying so hard to understand.",5,1763905052.0,MuslimNikah,5,1.0,False

1p4mttw,https://i.redd.it/po3rhlpud03g1.jpeg,Fragrance World Coffee Collection - In search of the best brew,"While I was looking for a decent coffee fragrance, I stumbled upon Fragrance World's Coffee Collection and they really sparked my curiosity. Unfortunately, I couldn't get every sample I wanted (Caramel Macchiato was out of stock at Fragrantika when I placed my order) but still, we have six different coffee fragrances to take a closer look at.  

  

Here are my thoughts on (almost) every fragrance in the Coffee Collection, in no particular order:  

  

*   **Double Espresso** It starts with a somewhat synthetic, plasticky opening that quickly turns into a pretty realistic, unsweetened, dark roast, almost burnt coffee scent. I also get some woody and smoky undertones and that's all, this is a very linear and simplistic fragrance that's just pure coffee and nothing else really. I kinda like it but I think it wouldn't qualify as an actual fragrance for a lot of people. I'd only recommend it if you want to smell like roasted coffee beans or use it for layering if that's your jam. Solid 8 hours of longevity and medium projection for the first few hours.  

   

*   **Qahwa** Synthetic opening with lots of sugar, even more cardamom and some vanilla, after a few minutes, we get some coffee and smoke as well. It stays like that for around 30 minutes, and then finally some dates show up for good measure. The drydown is less sweet and feels better than the opening but honestly, I'm not a fan. The cardamom overpowers everything, there's just not enough coffee here and the overall composition feels very oriental. It's a bit like Lattafa Khamrah or Zimaya Sharaf Blend with some coffee and smoke but more synthetic and lesser quality. Again, solid 8 hours of longevity and medium projection.  

  

*   **Irish Coffee** This one opens with rum, woods, leather and smoke, a bit harsh but it gets better quickly. A few minutes in, and we get some dry, unsweetened coffee notes, it feels very masculine on my skin. In the drydown, the booze note turns into something that's closer to irish whiskey than rum and finally, we get subtle notes of lightly sweet caramel that makes the overall scent profile much smoother. This is pretty good but it's not for everyone. It reminds me Bentley For Men Intense with some caramel and a coffee note added. Same performance as the previous fragrances.  

  

*   **Kopi Luwak** Wow, that's unusual. Prominent rose note in the opening that quickly turns into a coffee-rose mix. Very floral with no sweetness whatsoever. In the drydown it gets earthy with oud and patchouli coming into play. It's like having an unsweetened coffee in a garden of roses while someone is digging a hole next to you. I think it's well made and has good quality overall but I don't know who would want to wear this. Maybe sophisticated mature ladies who enjoy daring fragrances or fans of Moschino Toy Boy who also like coffee? Similar performance to the previous fragrances (man, these are consistent..).  

  

*   **Affogato** This is really good. Sweet, creamy vanilla with hints of rum and coffee, a very ""tasty"" gourmand opening. We get a noticeable amount of cinnamon, caramel with some more coffee in the drydown, it really does what it says on the tin and projects the aroma of a coffee-dessert. It kinda reminds me of Givenchy Gentleman Society Extreme but with a unisex/fem leaning twist and a long lasting coffee note. It also has similarities to the Angel's Share DNA. Overall, this is one of the highlights so far, well made, well blended, and performs just like the others.  

  

*   **Mocha** This is probably the worst of them all. Sweet, spicy cardamom and STRONG floral notes with something that smells like old chocolate in the background. Somehow it is reminiscent of those chocolate coated banana treats that you can get in some parts of the world. I guess FW managed to unintentionally create a super artificial, stale banana note with all the ingredients they mixed together here. I'm sorry but this is no bueno, also no coffee notes here. Same performance as the others (in this case, regrettably).",2,1763904799.0,Colognes,0,1.0,False

1.  Flow meter is not clogged 
2. The water pump is building pressure since the steam and hot water are functioning 
3. Heater is working fine since it is producing steam and hot water.
4. Electro valve might work.. here I have some doubts. Entering in the test menu and pressing the Steam button, I can hear the piston inside the valve. Also I’ve dismantled it and doesn’t look clogged.
5. Brewing unit looks good, piston is moving, it produces the coffee puck since i see it in the bin.
6. The tube from the brewing unit looked clogged and I removed it. At the end into the droppings part I’ve found a small white plastic that looks like a small tube but with one end closed. See the photos. After removing it and reassemble the machine I was expecting that I can enjoy a coffee, but not the same simptom, the pump looks like is struggling to build pressure but there is no water coming. 

I’ve removed the pipe and I was expecting that the water is coming in the tray without going to the brewing unit, but this is not happening, so going back it might be the valve that separate the water for coffee and for hot/steam, but it is passing the manual test. 

All the orings are clean and with silicone.

Any thoughts? What else to test? What can be that plastic that was obturating the tube?",1,1763904702.0,whatisit,0,1.0,False

I’ll be studying in Pécs next semester and I’m aiming to keep my food expenses to around 50,000 HUF per month (just for home cooked meals, as I plan to eat out only once a week, usually just grabbing coffee and a toast at a café). I’ll be preparing 12-14 meals a week at home and focusing on meal prepping to stay within budget.

I’m looking for healthy options. I’d really appreciate any tips on: Affordable, high-protein ingredients available in Pécs, supermarkets or stores that offer good deals for students, easy, healthy, and cost-effective meal prep ideas, and lastly, personal experiences or advice on living frugally as a student in Pécs.

Looking forward to your suggestions!

The ship was eerily quiet when he woke up. No hum of the gravity engine, no soft bubbling from the pipes. The ship was quiet. It took him a few moments to realize why, and he immediately grabbed for his pistol under his pillow. It was there. He sat up and stretched a little, then went to the small bathroom and put his hand under the dispenser; a pill dropped down, and he swallowed it quickly. Once in the morning, once in the evening. Just to keep the nightmares away. He continued his morning routine, brushed his teeth, got dressed, and was about to leave when he saw the pistol belt and remembered Kiko. He grabbed the belt, checked the pistol, and then walked out.

The hallway was empty, and he saw that the door to his crewmates ' room was closed and locked. He would have to go through them, but first, he needed to check the cockpit and the energy reading. He walked to the cockpit and found it empty. Outside, he saw the wall of ice that he had made last night. He admired the wall for a few seconds, the ship was surrounded by this cold, blue-white ice. It felt almost magical, and he should be cold, but the cockpit had its standard 22 degrees.  He shook himself out of the thoughts; he could admire it later. He sat down and started working. The ship had started the small repairs, but was in need of some metal to complete the repairs itself completely. He had to smile as he looked at the self-repairing nanoparticles program. He remembered how they had argued over it. The captain had insisted, and he had paid out of his own pocket for it. Vanity program, Sayed had called it. Well, that Vanity program was going to save his ass. He started to go over the full list. Besides a ton of high-quality steel, he also needed to get Osmium, Palladium, silver, tungsten, silicon, as well as Plastic and carbonite.  All in all, it was only about 800 kilos in all.  Then he would have to get into the engine room when it had cooled down, fix that leak, and get it up and running so he got real power.  The generator was good, but would at most last two months at the level of stress the ship put on it. If he were lucky, then he could restart the generator without too many repairs.

Kiko handed him a cup of coffee, and he accepted it as he muttered a thank you, and then turned his attention to the communication. He had released it in orbit, but they had lost contact with it. So now he only had the scans the ship had done on the way down to work with. So the first priority was to get that link up and going. He sipped the coffee.

He noticed someone looking at him and looked up. She was leaning against the window, looking at him with a cup in her hand, still wearing the orange overalls.

“Hi,” she said, and he said “hi” back.

“So what do you want me to do? Just walk around?” She asked, and he leaned back a little, and the seat adjusted to his movement.

“Well… you were pretty handy with that drone last night. Did you find anything?”

“I put it on autopilot and had it go on a scanning round. The files should be in the system. What am I going to look for? I’m not trained in this. It's my first crash landing.”

He smiled. “My third, the first two were in the academy.” He looked at her. She was beautiful, and then he remembered her question and his late wife.  His childhood sweetheart. He remembered she had told him the first night in camp that they had to survive no matter what, and that if one survived, then that person had to live for both of them.

She just looked at him, almost as if she could read his mind. “Well, you survived them all, so I’m in good hands, I guess?”

“Yes, I did. So sit down, we have a lot of work to do. We need to get communication up and working. I released a satellite into orbit as we were crashing, and we need to contact it. If there are any space stations nearby, then it will pick them up. No, don’t get your hopes up, that is just the first step to get communication up and running.  I will be working on that. Your job is to go over the drones' files and scans for any signs of life and, if possible, these metals,” he showed her the list.

“That’s one big list. Are you sure you can get the ship fixed with those?”

“That’s what the AI is asking for now, it might ask for more later. But those things should, in theory, be enough.” He said, and she looked at him and, without missing a beat, replied.

“When has theory ever survived a crash landing with reality?”

He smiled. “Maybe this is the first time?”

“If it's not, then I won't be giving up, so we'd better start working.” She replied and sat down. He looked at her as she started to work. He tore his eyes away from her and started to work.

After an hour, she whistled as she sat back. “damn, never seen those guys before.”

He turned to her, and she noticed and shared it. The large cockpit window turned into a large screen. An image of a humanoid that looked like a greyskinned humanoid with a pig's nose and small tusks. He had yellow eyes. He had dark fur-like hair running down his back, which they could not see more of because he wore leather clothes. He had some scars on his face, held what looked like a wooden-and-steel crossbow, and at his belt hung a hatchet and two polished skulls. The scans revealed him to be organic.  Then the picture widened to show several others in the same type of clothes, with similar weapons.

“No tech detected more advanced than the Iron Age, maybe some steel. They seem to be out hunting.”

“Damn, he is ugly. We need to find out just how much of a threat those guys are. Did you locate their homes?”

“Yes, there are three settlements, and they are built of stone and wood. Lots of colour too. Looks like a bloody rainbow.”

Images of a village with several houses that seemed to be a mix of longhouses made out of stone with wooden roofs, and all the buildings seemed to be covered in paint. It was done purposely and with great care. She put the three settlements up next to each other. They had a few things in common; first was the wall, which was made to withstand a serious attack. Then it was the way the houses were built and painted, and lastly, there was the large pit in the middle of the village. It looked like a wheel from above, with stone bridges going to the middle of the round pit.  The pits were all filled with oil and set on fire.

“I think it's some sort of religious thing,” she said, and Peter nodded.

“Okay, any of those guys heading towards us?”

“Not directly, no.”

“Good, let's hope it stays that way. I’m getting hungry, let's grab some lunch.” He got up, and she looked at him and bit back a remark as she got up as well.",7,1763904549.0,HFY,2,1.0,False

1p4mnm6,https://www.reddit.com/r/GardenToolReviews/comments/1p4mnm6/review_marcytop_dualchamber_compost_tumbler/,[Review] Marcytop Dual-Chamber Compost Tumbler — Honest thoughts after 3 months,"Been using this for 3 months in a small-city backyard (two adults, light kitchen scraps + some yard trimmings). Bought the Marcytop Dual-Chamber for $99.99 because I wanted something compact, rodent-resistant, and easy to spin without spending big on a metal tumbler. Here’s what actually happened after feeding it, turning it, and occasionally swearing at it.

## Build quality & materials

The drum is molded plastic (not thick roto-molded like some higher-end models). Feels lightweight but not brittle so far: after seasonal sun exposure the black/scuffed surface faded a little but no cracks yet. Frame is powder-coated steel with basic welds; nothing fancy. 

Aeration is provided by molded ribs and a handful of punched vents in each chamber: not a sophisticated diffusion system, but enough to avoid instant anaerobic rot if you keep your C:N ratio reasonable and turn every few days. No insulation beyond the plastic shell, so don't expect high R-value or proper hot composting in cold weather: you’ll mostly get mesophilic activity unless you live in a warm zone and pile it heavy.

## Stability of stand/frame: the important bit

This is where my opinion changed the most over time. Out of the box the frame looks fine: it sits on four feet, the axle is held by two U-shaped supports, and the whole thing is light and easy to position. For the first few weeks: when both chambers were only half filled: rotation was smooth and the unit seemed solid. Then I filled one side mostly with damp leaves and coffee grounds, and the whole thing started to wobble noticeably when I spun it. The axle support has some play, so when the drum is heavy the top of the frame rocks front-to-back.

I had a gusty day and didn’t anchor it: the tumbler shifted a few inches and almost toppled when I gave it a firm rotation. Not a disaster, just unnerving. I compared it in my head to a Good Ideas tumbler I used years ago: that one had a heavier base, wider footprint, and no flex. This Marcytop is fine on perfectly level ground, but on anything uneven or soft (mulch, grass after rain) it wants to lean. I fixed it by bolting the feet to two patio pavers and adding a 1/4” carriage bolt through the lower crossbar into a concrete block. Ugly, but solved the worst wobble.

If you plan to load one side full and spin aggressively, budget in some anchoring or a DIY brace. Also beware of kids or dogs bumping it: the lightweight frame transmits motion, and a sudden nudge while one side is full can make the whole thing shift. For me, stability was the only thing that went from ""acceptable"" to ""annoying until fixed.""

## Other key aspects (capacity, turning, vents, access, durability)

**Capacity:** I measured by filling with water: each chamber holds roughly 40 L (about 10.5 US gallons), so total is roughly 80 L (~21 gallons / ~2.8 cu ft). That size is actually handy for a two-person household who composts kitchen scraps and trims, but it’s small if you’re chipping a lot of yard waste. Bulk density matters: thick woody material reduces usable volume fast.

**Rotation mechanism:** axle with a central handle that turns the whole drum. The gearing is direct (no fancy geartrain) so it’s simple but you feel the load. When half-full it spins with one hand. When full it’s stiff and you need both hands or to lean into it. The handle feels a bit flimsy plasticky compared to metal-handled competitors. I wouldn't recommend wrestling it full of wet lawn clippings.

**Aeration/venting:** There are vents but not a forced-aeration design. Oxygen diffusion is decent if you maintain a good C:N ratio and turn frequently; I got no strong anaerobic smells. For thermophilic phases (hot composting) you’ll struggle in cooler months because the unit has almost zero insulation and limited mass.

**Drain/compost tea port:** There’s a small drain hole with a plastic plug. It’s useful and collects tea if you use a tray, but the plug isn’t gasketed: expect slow weeping if you turn wet material. I swapped the plug for a rubber grommet to stop the drips.

**Access/harvest door:** The harvest openings are small-ish but usable; you won’t be scooping out a full shovel at once. The door seal is just a lip: it keeps most pests out, but tiny ants and fruit flies can find their way in if you leave fresh fruit scraps near the door.

Overall pest-proofing is decent compared to an open pile; rats would have a hard time getting in, but don’t assume it’s 100% rodent-proof without anchoring and good door hygiene.

## Assembly complexity & weather resistance

Assembly took me about an hour and a half with basic tools. Instructions are… adequate but not great. A few of the bolts were tricky to align because the plastic mounting points have a bit of flex. After 3 months of sun and occasional rain the metal frame shows minimal surface corrosion (I live in a temperate, not salty, environment). UV has faded the drum color but not caused cracking. YMMV in harsher climates.

## The reality check: drawbacks you’ll notice

- Hard to turn when full. This is the most persistent gripe. If you plan to overload one side or add heavy wet yard waste often, you’ll either need to turn more strategically (balance chambers) or understand that turning frequency and effort increase. The handle could strip over time if abused.
- Stand instability. As mentioned, the legs are fine on level hard ground but will rock/tip on uneven or soft surfaces. Marketing pics always show them on perfect patio pavers: that’s the safe condition. If your yard is uneven, plan to anchor or reinforce.
- Smallish capacity. For a couple it’s fine, but if you're running a small homestead, chicken yard, or shred a lot of branches, this will fill fast and slow decomposition. You can’t realistically hot-compost big volumes here.
- Drain plug weeps. The non-gasketed plug is a leaky design choice. Easy to fix but annoying out-of-the-box.
What actually works well
- Smell control and containment: Much better than an open bin. No complaints from neighbors after two weeks of food scraps.
- Speeds up decomposition vs a static pile if you turn 2–3 times a week. I hit mesophilic temps reliably; thermophilic only in midsummer.
- Compact footprint: fits in small yards and looks tidy once anchored.
- Good value for $99.99 if you want entry-level tumbling and are willing to accept compromises.

## Final verdict
Bottom line: At $99.99 the Marcytop Dual-Chamber is a decent budget option for urban gardeners and beginners who want a compact, rodent-resistant tumbler and don’t need heavy-duty capacity or hot-compost performance. It contains smells, makes turning less miserable (when not full), and is fairly easy to assemble.

If you care deeply about a rock-solid frame and smooth turning when loaded, spend more on a heavier-duty model (Good Ideas or FCMP-style units) or be prepared to reinforce the stand. Also consider alternatives with better insulation if you want year-round hot composting (Jora or HotBin territory). For weekend warriors and city composters who want something inexpensive and serviceable, this will do the job: just plan for anchoring, a new drain plug, and sensible loading practices.",1,1763904318.0,GardenToolReviews,0,1.0,False

I've never been so embarrassed and so enlightened at the same time.,"So, picture this: I'm a fresh-faced junior dev, maybe three months into my first real coding job. I get a ticket to handle user permissions for a dashboard. We had admins, editors, viewers, and a few other weird custom roles. My brain immediately goes to what I know best: a massive, sprawling fortress of if/elif/else statements.

For three days, I wrestled with this thing. I was in the zone, fueled by cheap office coffee and the glow of my monitor at 2 AM. I nested conditions, handled edge cases, and finally, my glorious 100-line monster worked perfectly. Every role saw exactly what it was supposed to see. I felt like a genius, a true architect of logic. I pushed the code for review, sat back, and waited for the inevitable praise to roll in.

The next morning, our senior dev, a quiet guy named Mike who could probably code in his sleep, calls me over. He's got my code on his screen. But instead of praise, he just calmly says, ""Hey, can I show you something?"" He highlights my entire 100-line masterpiece, all my hard work, and hits delete. My heart just sinks into my stomach. Then, he writes about three lines of code: a dictionary where the keys were the user roles and the values were their permissions. A simple one-line lookup. That's it. It did everything my code did, but it was clean, instant, and a thousand times easier to read.

I kid you not, my jaw was on the floor. I felt this hot wave of embarrassment wash over me. I thought I was getting fired for writing the dumbest code in history. But Mike just smiled and said, ""Don't worry, we've all been there. It's a classic lesson in using the right tool for the job."" In that moment, it all clicked. It wasn't just about making it *work*; it was about making it smart and simple. I went from feeling like a fool to having this massive 'eureka' moment in about ten seconds.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1p4mlmq,https://www.reddit.com/r/virgin/comments/1p4mlmq/what_would_you_do_as_a_30_years_virgin/,What would you do as a 30 Years Virgin ?,"Hello everyone, this is my first post on Reddit. I have never used Reddit much, but I recently searched about people in their 30s who are still virgins and found many topics and stories about their struggles. I want to share my story as well. I won't share too much personal stuff about myself, I am from a poor country that moved to the west, 1.84m, blonde hair with dark shades, blue eyes and fit body type ( I used to be skinny fat ).

In my 20s, I was a virgin and struggled with the same issue. People told me to focus on myself, improve my life, and make friends. I had two or three friends back home and I was happy with that. I did not feel like a loser, but in women’s eyes I was considered one. So I began working on myself. I moved from a poorly developed country to a better one in the West to start a new life. I worked my way up, found better job opportunities, and by 30 I secured a very good remote job. I also started part time security work, which helped me meet many people and make friends. It also motivated me even more to be more fit in the gym. I built muscle and began eating properly. 

During my time in the West, I made many more friends, couples, families, and people I go out with every weekend. I meet new women regularly and I have received many numbers, but nothing ever developed beyond friendship. I often hear, “You’re attractive, but I don’t see you as more than a friend,” or, “I’d like to go out for coffee, but not dating.”

Now that my life is more stable, even though it was a long struggle to completely change my environment, I feel it was the right choice. I want to understand how women think. What I realised is that many women do not like “good guys.” I started researching what women actually want, and it seems many prefer men who are colder, more confident, and more mysterious. They are less interested in men who are an open book or too easy to read. They lose interest quickly and can sense desperation. I know not all women are like this, but from what I have seen, many are. Even if a woman acts differently at first, over time she may lose interest if you always agree with her and act like the nice guy.

So my new approach began. I have been using dating apps, approaching women in real life, asking for numbers, asking them out, and dealing with rejection and ghosting. In the past two months I have been rejected many times, which for me feels like a game and I'm not taking it personal. I have noticed more compliments from women, especially older women who are more direct. At my part-time job, there are women who give me persistent looks, and one even found me on Instagram and invited me out for drinks. The only issue is that she is not my type. She is overweight, which is fine in this time and age, but since I am very committed to the gym, I would like a partner who is healthy and active with me.

At 30, I have learned to be more nonchalant, colder, and more mysterious, and to avoid sharing too much about my life, just make them guess. I still have a lot to learn, but this approach seems to work better. I have only been doing this for the past four or five months, so it is still a work in progress.

My current issue is that I am still a virgin at 30. I can see progress in how women react to me, but I am questioning what I actually want. Do I want a partner, or do I just crave sex for now? Two women have shown interest in me, but I am not attracted to them. I would prefer someone more fit. I am comfortable being alone, but I crave the sexual experience, especially because my friends constantly talk about it. I am putting more effort into becoming more mysterious and learning more about women, but recently the sexual urge has been very strong. I am about to turn 31 and I have never even kissed a girl.

This leads to the thought of hiring an escort just to clear my mind. The desire distracts me at work and affects my performance on daily basis, let it be work or my improvement with women. So my question is:

1.Should I wait longer, keep improving myself, and hope to have my first sexual experience with someone random I meet in a nightclub or on a dating app ? ( Been trying the past months, but it's been ghostings from them or breadcrumbing me ) 

2.Should I hire a professional escort which I find attractive to get it over with and regain my focus on work, self-improvement, and becoming better with women, with the hope of eventually finding the right partner for a long-term relationship?

3.Should I lose my virginity to one of the women I met at work, even though they are not my type and may want a long-term relationship, which I do not reciprocate because the attraction is not mutual? ( And they say to not shit where you sleep ) 

I know that women can sense my frustration even though I try to control it and hide it. My discipline has been strong this past year, but the biological urge is difficult to manage, I am aware sex is not not a human need like water is, but it can mess with your brain no matter how hard you try to control it, I've been doing it for half my life so I know the struggles as many of you might as well.",3,1763904167.0,virgin,0,0.8,False

An unexpected stop made my day.,"I live in a rural area of Montana where to get “anywhere” is an hour drive. I also am dealing with a rare disease and the medications to treat it leading me to need a cane and to not recognize the body I’m in. 

Anyway I was recently headed to town for an appointment and getting there I suddenly needed a restroom. I pulled in to the closest business which happened to be a Starbucks and hobbled in. It was nearly empty and the barista greeted me as I motioned and shuffled to the restroom. I was bracing for someone to say some version of “restrooms are for customers” but she just smiled. 

Coming out I knew I was pressed for time and also felt an obligation to patronize the business so I asked if she could start a coffee for me but that I needed to go grab my wallet from my car. 

When I hobbled back in she waved me to the other end and said my coffee would be up in a minute. She refused to let me pay. 

Now, mind you, in the last year as my health deteriorated and I got my diagnosis, I’ve been largely unable to cry. But this sweet and unexpected random act of kindness brought tears to my eyes.

20 days ago I introduced the idea of **Usenet streaming directly inside Stremio** using my add-on, **UsenetStreamer**.

If you missed those posts, here are the links:

* [Post 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1oogtpy/stremio_addon_that_lets_you_stream_all_of_usenet/)
* [Post 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/StremioAddons/comments/1oyzn7j/usenetstreamer_v130_huge_update_hydra_support_nzb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

This update will make a lot more sense if you’ve read those first.

Today, I’m excited to announce **UsenetStreamer v1.4.2** 🎉 — which comes with **a couple of major updates** and **lots of important minor improvements**.

👉 [GitHub](https://github.com/Sanket9225/UsenetStreamer)  
👉 [Discord](https://discord.gg/w6PqzSaP)

# 🚀 Major Update #1 – Built-in Newznab (No Prowlarr / NZBHydra Needed)

UsenetStreamer now has a **built-in Newznab**.

This means:

* You no longer need **Prowlarr** or **NZBHydra**
* Just paste your **indexer API key**
* Add as many indexers as you like
* Manage everything directly inside UsenetStreamer

This massively simplifies setup and removes one big dependencies from the stack.

# 🚀 Major Update #2 – Easynews as an Indexer

Most people know **Easynews** as a Usenet provider, but it also has a web-based search interface.

Even though Easynews Web is not really NNTP-based, it still provides:

* A large and diverse catalog
* Reliable search results
* Access to NZB files

With **v1.4.2**, you can now use **Easynews as an indexer inside UsenetStreamer**.

This means:

* You get access to Easynews’ results
* Without dealing with slow web streaming
* With much lower latency and smoother playback

# 🔧 Major Improvements to the Existing Stack

# Better De-duplication

De-duping on Usenet is hard because the same name doesn’t always mean the same content and reposts happen frequently.  
The logic has now been improved to reduce clutter and show cleaner results.

# Multiple Language Selection 🌍

You’re no longer limited to one preferred language.  
You can now select **multiple languages**, which is especially useful since many non-English releases are hard to find on torrents or debrid services.

# Better Sorting & Formatting

Results are now presented in a cleaner and more consistent way, making it easier to identify the best releases.

# Limit Results Per Resolution

You can control how many results appear per resolution

Much cleaner result lists overall.

# Improved Health Check System

The health check logic is now smarter.

If all NZBs fail the first time you open a movie:

* The next time you open the same movie/show
* More NZBs are checked automatically
* Instead of repeating the same failing ones

This makes the system much more reliable over time.

# 🔮 Upcoming Major Improvement – Faster Start Time

Since my very first post, I’ve promised a **faster start time**.

Ideally, streams should start in around **\~5 seconds**.  
Right now, it’s typically **10–15 seconds**.

Bringing that delay down is still one of my **top priorities** and will be the next big improvement in UsenetStreamer.

# 🏠 Important Note for Self-Hosters

If you’re running this **inside your own network**, you **don’t need SSL at all**.

You can simply:

* Host UsenetStreamer on your local machine or server
* Access it from devices on the same network
* Stream normally through Stremio

This has been confirmed by community users (not directly tested by me yet) and makes local setup much easier.

# ☁️ Don’t Want to Self-Host?

You can also use the **ELFHOSTED instance**, which currently has a **free trial until the end of December** for UsenetStreamer users.

A good option if you don’t want to deal with self-hosting at all.

Sterile white striplights buzzed a dissonant chorus overhead, casting a clammy sheen over the subdued faces of the UoW Fantasy Book Club. Seattle autumns brought a drab humidity to the air and Pacific rain lashed against the windows of the library, setting the tone for today's subject of discussion: 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. The group were just a few chapters deep into the fourth book, still collectively reeling from the literary gut-punch of the red wedding. 

Maya, curled up in a stiffly padded armchair clutching her well-worn copy of 'A Feast for Crows', fidgeted with a loose strand of mousy hair. Unlike the rest of the group, clad in their typical monotone attire, Maya stood out in a faded floral dress, her half-hearted attempt to inject a little color into a dreary afternoon. Behind wide-rimmed glasses, her eyes darted across the page, devouring each twist and turn of Westerosi politics and culture. 

Maya, much like the rest of her outlandish friend group, wasn't exactly the typical college student. She enjoyed the occasional Netflix binge and drink-fuelled social event as much as the next person, but her heart was never truly settled in the real world.  She devoured fantasy novels with vigour and could while away entire weeks daydreaming of distant and magical lands. 

In the world of dragons and white walkers, Maya was a self-proclaimed ""Margaery apologist."" She championed the young queen on every page, analyzing her motives and behaviour with all the dedication she should have been committing to her English lit. degree. Her friends would often tease her, calling her ""Lady Maya"" or ""The Rose of Seattle,"" nicknames she quietly cherished with flushed cheeks. 

Today Theo, a more recent addition to the group, had the audacity to raise into question the morality of the woman who went through kings like morning cups of coffee. He argued that Margaery was every bit as scheming and selfish as the Lannisters, using her body and apparent innocence to manipulate and scheme her way to power. Maya of course rushed to the defense of her favourite character and before long discussion turned to debate. 

Outside the sky swirled with an ominous grey hue, distant rumbles of thunder manifesting a harsh wind that howled against the brick walls of the aged library building. The book club were oblivious to the brewing storm, until at once the heated conversation reached fever pitch and a low growl echoed through the library, a sound ripped straight from the pages of the book which Maya gripped with frustrated fingers. A shiver ran down her spine and in a moment of tempestuous chaos a nearby window shattered unleashing gusts of rain-soaked air that caused the bookshelves to lurch forward and send a million pages of erudite literature sprawling through the air. Panic surged through the group as the world dissolved into a swirling vortex of color and sound around them, then faded to blackness. 

Maya awoke with a disoriented gasp as new senses invaded her muddled mind. The stale library air was replaced by a smoky musk of burning wood and stone, garnished with the faint sweetness of lavender and rosewater. Gone were the bleak, painted white walls and plastic shelves; instead she was surrounded by rough-hewn masonry adorned with vibrant tapestries and black steel braziers. Her eyes fluttered in a dance of perplexion as she took in the overwhelmingly opulent sight of this lavishly furnished room that shimmered with an energy of immeasurable wealth despite its antiquated palette. 

Maya raised to her feet, her fingers trembling as they drifted along the smooth silk of the royal green gown clinging to her form. A far cry from her itchy woollen sweater, the fabric far too soft and extravagant for her usual budget-conscious wardrobe. Her heart pounded in her chest as she stumbled over the hard stone floor towards a nearby mirror framed in gold, a thousand nervous anxieties gnawing at her mind. The reflection that met her weary gaze sent an instant jolt of terror fizzing through her. 

Wide, almond-shaped eyes the colour of glistening emeralds stared back at her. High cheekbones framed by a cascade of chestnut waves that tumbled over her shoulders in a way that Maya could never dream of taming her own tangled curls. Gone was the smattering of freckles that dusted her nose and cheeks, replaced by a smooth, flawless complexion that glowed with an almost ethereal beauty. There was no denying the face reflected in the polished silver and glass. Gone was Maya the bookish plain-girl, replaced by a beauty as legendary as it was deadly - The Queen of Roses, Margaery Tyrell.

 
*Hello! Like many I've been on an ASOIAF/Game of Thrones kick recently, so here is a fun little roleplay idea in which a group of college book nerds find themselves magically transported into GRRM's world of medieval politics, warfare, fantasy and love. Not only that, but instead of their regular dorky selves, the group finds themselves inhabiting the bodies of their favourite characters from the book/show forcing them to engage with the central narratives first hand and change the course of Westerosi history.* 

*As you can see above I wrote my character, Maya, becoming Lady Margaery of Highgarden. She will have to learn to adapt to an archaic world which treats women as bargaining chips and objects of pleasure, using her newfound beauty and modern intelligence to survive and thrive in the brutal frenzy of scheming and plotting that is King's Landing.*

In the summer of 2001, nineteen young men from various corners of the Arab world arrived in the United States with one official goal: learn how to fly planes, but definitely not land them. What nobody expected (least of all the FBI agents who kept losing their paperwork) was that these guys were the most chaotic, lovable bunch of disaster magnets ever assembled.

There was Mohammed Atta, the uptight team captain who wore his scowl like a permanent hijab and kept trying to run the operation like a German train schedule. His roommate Marwan al-Shehhi was a walking Red Bull overdose who thought every mission briefing needed a prank. Ziad Jarrah was the romantic one, constantly FaceTiming his girlfriend in Germany and crying because “babe, I can’t tell you what I’m planning, it’s a surprise.” Hani Hanjour couldn’t parallel park a Cessna to save his life but swore he’d “figure it out on the big day.” And then there was the B-squad: the muscle hijackers, fifteen gym bros whose entire personality was protein shakes and shouting “Allahu akbar!” at inappropriate moments, like when someone cut them off in the Walmart parking lot.

Their Florida flight school days were pure sitcom. Marwan once hot-wired the flight simulator to play PlayStation 2 games mid-lesson. Hani kept crashing Microsoft Flight Simulator so hard the instructor thought he was doing it on purpose for laughs. (“No, no, Mr. Hani, you cannot take off from a highway in a 747.”) Mohammed tried to impose bedtime and Koran study hours, but the muscle boys turned the apartment into a 24/7 hookah-and-Call-of-Duty den. Someone replaced the morning adhān alarm with DMX. Atta almost had an aneurysm.

The hijinx peaked during “box cutter shopping” at Target. The muscle team decided they needed the shiniest, most extra box cutters money could buy. They spent forty-five minutes arguing over which color handle was most intimidating (consensus: neon orange). Then Marwan dared Khalid al-Mihdhar to ride the kiddie mechanical horse outside while waving a plastic scimitar he found in the toy aisle. Security was called. Somehow they all left with extra snacks and zero arrests because the manager assumed it was some weird frat thing.

September rolled around. The big day. Four teams. Four planes. Zero chill.

American Airlines Flight 11 (Atta & pals): They board in Boston looking like the world’s most suspicious boy band. Marwan keeps trying to take selfies with the flight attendants. Atta hisses, “This is not Instagram!” They storm the cockpit thirty minutes in. The pilot’s last words over the radio are, “Who are these clowns?”

United 175 (Marwan’s crew): Marwan actually apologizes to the passengers after taking over. “Sorry for the inconvenience, folks, free nuts for everyone!” Then he lets a ten-year-old fly the plane for thirty seconds because the kid asked nicely. The plane still hits the South Tower because even chaos has deadlines.

American 77 (Hani Hanjour driving): Hani spends twenty minutes circling the Pentagon trying to “line it up right.” Passengers later say they heard him muttering, “Left a little… no, right… wait, where’s reverse?” He eventually nails it, but only after almost landing on the White House lawn by accident. Dick Cheney is heard yelling, “That’s not how you park, son!”

United 93 (Ziad Jarrah and the muscle squad): This is where it all goes full Looney Tunes. The passengers revolt after the hijackers get distracted arguing over who gets to make the dramatic announcement. One of the muscle boys accidentally plays the Backstreet Boys over the PA instead of the pre-recorded martyrdom message. Passengers charge. A legendary scuffle ensues involving a beverage cart, boiling coffee, and someone’s auntie from Pittsburgh swinging a handbag like Thor’s hammer. The plane crashes in a Pennsylvania field, but not before Ziad tearfully live-streams on a Nokia, “Tell Aysel I love her, and also tell Marwan this is HIS fault for bringing the wrong cassette!”

History is made. The world changes forever. Cable news runs 24/7. Conspiracy theorists are born. Somewhere in the afterlife, these nineteen absolute legends are still arguing over whose turn it was to bring the box cutters.

And that, kids, is how a bunch of spunky misfits with the combined organizational skills of a raccoon on bath salts accidentally rewrote the 21st century.

Sterile white striplights buzzed a dissonant chorus overhead, casting a clammy sheen over the subdued faces of the UoW Fantasy Book Club. Seattle autumns brought a drab humidity to the air and Pacific rain lashed against the windows of the library, setting the tone for today's subject of discussion: 'A Song of Ice and Fire'. The group were just a few chapters deep into the fourth book, still collectively reeling from the literary gut-punch of the red wedding. 

Maya, curled up in a stiffly padded armchair clutching her well-worn copy of 'A Feast for Crows', fidgeted with a loose strand of mousy hair. Unlike the rest of the group, clad in their typical monotone attire, Maya stood out in a faded floral dress, her half-hearted attempt to inject a little color into a dreary afternoon. Behind wide-rimmed glasses, her eyes darted across the page, devouring each twist and turn of Westerosi politics and culture. 

Maya, much like the rest of her outlandish friend group, wasn't exactly the typical college student. She enjoyed the occasional Netflix binge and drink-fuelled social event as much as the next person, but her heart was never truly settled in the real world.  She devoured fantasy novels with vigour and could while away entire weeks daydreaming of distant and magical lands. 

In the world of dragons and white walkers, Maya was a self-proclaimed ""Margaery apologist."" She championed the young queen on every page, analyzing her motives and behaviour with all the dedication she should have been committing to her English lit. degree. Her friends would often tease her, calling her ""Lady Maya"" or ""The Rose of Seattle,"" nicknames she quietly cherished with flushed cheeks. 

Today Theo, a more recent addition to the group, had the audacity to raise into question the morality of the woman who went through kings like morning cups of coffee. He argued that Margaery was every bit as scheming and selfish as the Lannisters, using her body and apparent innocence to manipulate and scheme her way to power. Maya of course rushed to the defense of her favourite character and before long discussion turned to debate. 

Outside the sky swirled with an ominous grey hue, distant rumbles of thunder manifesting a harsh wind that howled against the brick walls of the aged library building. The book club were oblivious to the brewing storm, until at once the heated conversation reached fever pitch and a low growl echoed through the library, a sound ripped straight from the pages of the book which Maya gripped with frustrated fingers. A shiver ran down her spine and in a moment of tempestuous chaos a nearby window shattered unleashing gusts of rain-soaked air that caused the bookshelves to lurch forward and send a million pages of erudite literature sprawling through the air. Panic surged through the group as the world dissolved into a swirling vortex of color and sound around them, then faded to blackness. 

Maya awoke with a disoriented gasp as new senses invaded her muddled mind. The stale library air was replaced by a smoky musk of burning wood and stone, garnished with the faint sweetness of lavender and rosewater. Gone were the bleak, painted white walls and plastic shelves; instead she was surrounded by rough-hewn masonry adorned with vibrant tapestries and black steel braziers. Her eyes fluttered in a dance of perplexion as she took in the overwhelmingly opulent sight of this lavishly furnished room that shimmered with an energy of immeasurable wealth despite its antiquated palette. 

Maya raised to her feet, her fingers trembling as they drifted along the smooth silk of the royal green gown clinging to her form. A far cry from her itchy woollen sweater, the fabric far too soft and extravagant for her usual budget-conscious wardrobe. Her heart pounded in her chest as she stumbled over the hard stone floor towards a nearby mirror framed in gold, a thousand nervous anxieties gnawing at her mind. The reflection that met her weary gaze sent an instant jolt of terror fizzing through her. 

Wide, almond-shaped eyes the colour of glistening emeralds stared back at her. High cheekbones framed by a cascade of chestnut waves that tumbled over her shoulders in a way that Maya could never dream of taming her own tangled curls. Gone was the smattering of freckles that dusted her nose and cheeks, replaced by a smooth, flawless complexion that glowed with an almost ethereal beauty. There was no denying the face reflected in the polished silver and glass. Gone was Maya the bookish plain-girl, replaced by a beauty as legendary as it was deadly - The Queen of Roses, Margaery Tyrell.

 
*Hello! Like many I've been on an ASOIAF/Game of Thrones kick recently, so here is a fun little roleplay idea in which a group of college book nerds find themselves magically transported into GRRM's world of medieval politics, warfare, fantasy and love. Not only that, but instead of their regular dorky selves, the group finds themselves inhabiting the bodies of their favourite characters from the book/show forcing them to engage with the central narratives first hand and change the course of Westerosi history.* 

*As you can see above I wrote my character, Maya, becoming Lady Margaery of Highgarden. She will have to learn to adapt to an archaic world which treats women as bargaining chips and objects of pleasure, using her newfound beauty and modern intelligence to survive and thrive in the brutal frenzy of scheming and plotting that is King's Landing.*

**It turns out that ""wellness"" is not a sign of getting old, but a sign of finally loving myself.**

For a long time, I thought wellness was something adults did because they had no choice anymore. Drinking less sugary soda, going home early, switching from cocktails to tea, taking vitamins, going to therapy, going to Pilates classes, sleeping before midnight… In my mind, all of that looked like surrender. Like admitting the body was no longer young and wild.

So I stayed up late, drank three coffees a day, skipped meals, survived on stress, and told myself I was still “young enough to handle it.” I thought I was proving something, when in reality I was just borrowing tomorrow’s strength to survive today.

Everything changed one night when I was staring at my laptop at 12:30 a.m., head pounding, hands shaking a little. I realized I wasn’t proving youth—I was quietly draining myself. So I started making small shifts. Not big declarations, just gentle steps: swapping soda for tea, cooking simple meals at home, taking vitamins, writing in my journal, going to therapy, signing up for Pilates once a week, and trying to get to bed before midnight. I wasn’t doing these things to look younger. I just wanted to feel okay in my own body.

Slowly, something softened. I stopped feeling like wellness meant I was “getting old” and started understanding that wellness meant I was finally paying attention. My body wasn’t complaining—it had carried me through stress, ambition, heartbreak, commutes, deadlines, and long days. I just never bothered to take care of it until now.

A friend of mine said the other day, “When we were younger we used our bodies to power through life. Now we use our bodies to hold life together.” I felt that. Wellness isn’t a concession. It’s learning to love the place we live in: our skin, our bones, our breath, our quiet.

It’s not that I got older and had to start taking care of myself. It’s that I finally grew up enough to give myself the care I always deserved.

1p4m3rz,https://i.redd.it/3ksd6gcb403g1.jpeg,Fragrance World Coffee Collection - In search of the best brew,"While I was looking for a decent coffee fragrance, I stumbled upon Fragrance World's Coffee Collection and they really sparked my curiosity. Unfortunately, I couldn't get every sample I wanted (Caramel Macchiato was out of stock at Fragrantika when I placed my order) but still, we have six different coffee fragrances to take a closer look at.

Here are my thoughts on (almost) every fragrance in the Coffee Collection, in no particular order:  

  

* **Double Espresso** It starts with a somewhat synthetic, plasticky opening that quickly turns into a pretty realistic, unsweetened, dark roast, almost burnt coffee scent. I also get some woody and smoky undertones and that's all, this is a very linear and simplistic fragrance that's just pure coffee and nothing else really. I kinda like it but I think it wouldn't qualify as an actual fragrance for a lot of people. I'd only recommend it if you want to smell like roasted coffee beans or use it for layering if that's your jam. Solid 8 hours of longevity and medium projection for the first few hours.  

  

* **Qahwa** Synthetic opening with lots of sugar, even more cardamom and some vanilla, after a few minutes, we get some coffee and smoke as well. It stays like that for around 30 minutes, and then finally some dates show up for good measure. The drydown is less sweet and feels better than the opening but honestly, I'm not a fan. The cardamom overpowers everything, there's just not enough coffee here and the overall composition feels very oriental. It's a bit like Lattafa Khamrah or Zimaya Sharaf Blend with some coffee and smoke but more synthetic and lesser quality. Again, solid 8 hours of longevity and medium projection.  

  

* **Irish Coffee** This one opens with rum, woods, leather and smoke, a bit harsh but it gets better quickly. A few minutes in, and we get some dry, unsweetened coffee notes, it feels very masculine on my skin. In the drydown, the booze note turns into something that's closer to irish whiskey than rum and finally, we get subtle notes of lightly sweet caramel that makes the overall scent profile much smoother. This is pretty good but it's not for everyone. It reminds me Bentley For Men Intense with some caramel and a coffee note added. Same performance as the previous fragrances.  

  

* **Kopi Luwak** Wow, that's unusual. Prominent rose note in the opening that quickly turns into a coffee-rose mix. Very floral with no sweetness whatsoever. In the drydown it gets earthy with oud and patchouli coming into play. It's like having an unsweetened coffee in a garden of roses while someone is digging a hole next to you. It's well made and has good quality overall but I think most people won't appreciate it. Maybe it's for sophisticated ladies who enjoy daring coffee fragrances or fans of Moschino Toy Boy with a soft spot for caffeine? I'm not sure. Similar performance to the previous fragrances (I have to say, these are consistent..).  

  

* **Affogato** This is really good. Sweet, creamy vanilla with hints of rum and coffee, a very ""tasty"" gourmand opening. We get a noticeable amount of cinnamon, caramel with some more coffee in the drydown, it really does what it says on the tin and projects the aroma of a coffee-dessert. It kinda reminds me of Givenchy Gentleman Society Extreme but with a unisex/fem leaning twist and a long lasting coffee note. It also has similarities to the Angel's Share DNA. Overall, this is one of the highlights so far, well made, well blended, and performs just like the others.  

  

* **Mocha** This is probably the worst of them all. Sweet, spicy cardamom and STRONG floral notes with something that smells like old chocolate in the background. Somehow it is reminiscent of those chocolate coated banana treats that you can get in some parts of the world. I guess FW managed to unintentionally create a super artificial, stale banana note with all the ingredients they mixed together here. I'm sorry but this is no bueno, also no coffee notes here. Same performance as the others (in this case, regrettably).  ",5,1763902744.0,Perfumes,1,1.0,False

I’ve bootstrapped a startup, taught tech to thousands, and now split my time between campus case discussions, weightroom therapy, and discovering new filter coffee spots. My happy weekends are bookstores, board games, indie films, street food, and long walks where the conversation wanders further than we do. Values: empathy over ego, growth over gossip, craft over clout.

Seeking: an intellectually curious woman (21+), emotionally literate, open to slow-burn connection. Someone who lights up at a great question, a surprising insight, or a beautifully argued essay. Bonus if you enjoy museums, flea markets, quizzes, midnight desserts, or debating whether cities should be designed for cars or children.

What we can do: chai and a stroll through a bookshop; swap our top five life-changing reads; co-create a tiny fun project; or simply sit on a quiet bench and talk about the thing you can’t stop thinking about this week—economics, cinema, sport, design, psychology, poetry, cricket, F1—your pick.

Boundaries: safety first; no pressure to escalate; consent is culture; kindness is non-negotiable.

If any of this resonates, send a thoughtful opener: your city, a recent idea that shook you, and a niche hill you’d die on. I’ll go first—mine change often, but right now: “Speed is a habit; depth is a practice.” I reply best to messages with curiosity, clarity, and a little wonder.

1p4lx0g,https://www.reddit.com/r/Lumark/comments/1p4lx0g/branches_in_psychology_lumark/,Branches in psychology | Lumark,"Psychology is basically the study of why people think, feel and behave in different ways. Humans are complicated, so psychology has different branches. Each one looks at behaviour from a different angle. I will explain it in a simple way like how I talk. No high-level words. Just straight vibes.

One branch is Biological psychology. This one is about the brain, nerves, hormones and all that body chemistry stuff. Like sometimes we feel happy without reason or suddenly get angry, that is hormones controlling us. For example, when I drink coffee and I feel super active, that is chemicals in the brain changing behaviour. Same way, low serotonin can make someone sad.

Next is Cognitive psychology. This is about thinking and memory. Like how we solve problems, take decisions or why we forget things. For example, I keep my phone somewhere and after 5 minutes I forget where I put it. That is memory processing. Or when we study for exam and mind goes blank, that is also part of cognitive process.

Then there is Developmental psychology. This one studies how humans grow from baby to old age. Like how kids learn fast, why teenagers act crazy sometimes or why old people become slow. We change a lot in every stage, mentally and emotionally.

Social psychology is another one. This is about how other people affect our behaviour. Like why we follow trends, why we act different in front of others, or why crowd behaviour is different. For example, when everyone is shouting in a football match, we also shout even if we are normally quiet. That is social influence.

Clinical psychology deals with mental health problems like anxiety, depression or phobia. These psychologists help people who are struggling mentally. Like if someone is scared to talk to people or they feel sad for no reason, clinical psychologists help them with therapy.

Counseling psychology is similar but for normal daily problems. Like relationship issues, family problem, stress, confusion about career and all. If someone is feeling lost and just needs someone to talk and guide, they go to counselor.

Educational psychology is about learning and teaching. Like how to study better, how teachers should teach, how to help students with problems. For example, some people learn fast by visuals, some by listening. Educational psychologists study that.

Industrial psychology is for workplace stuff. They study how to make employees happy, improve productivity and teamwork. Like how companies choose the right person for the job, or how to make work enjoyable.

Health psychology is about how mind affects body. For example stress can cause headache, stomach problem or hair fall. If someone wants to quit smoking or control diet, this branch helps.

Forensic psychology is used in crime field. They study why people commit crime, how to understand criminals, or helping police in investigations.

Sports psychology is for athletes to perform better, handle pressure, boost confidence and focus. Like when players panic before match, sports psychologists train their mind.

So basically psychology has many branches because one single area cannot explain everything about humans. Brain affects behaviour, society affects behaviour, mind affects body, everything is connected. That is why there are different types.

In short, psychology is not only about mental illness or reading people’s mind. It is used in day to day life, school, work, sports, court, everywhere. And honestly, it is very interesting to know why we act the way we act.",2,1763902139.0,Lumark,0,1.0,False

My husband and I have a 2.5-year-old. I'm always the one up in the mornings—I make the coffee and get our daughter ready for daycare. She typically wakes up around 6:00–6:15 a.m. He's not a morning person; I am. 

This morning, he picked her up and came downstairs. He was about to go back upstairs when she cried for him to come back, so he returned. However, all he did was lie down on the couch with a blanket over him because he was still tired (he's a night owl). I found it incredibly frustrating to interact and engage with our daughter while he just lay there. When I asked him to go back upstairs, he got mad at me and insisted he wanted to ""just be there."" It's frustrating that he considers that parenting. AITA in this situation??

This pattern continues on weekends—I'm alone with our daughter for 3–4 hours before he wakes up around 9:30 or 10:00 a.m.

I know parenting responsibilities will never be split exactly 50/50, and he is a great dad. We have different parenting styles, which I've tried to accept. However, even when he does spend one-on-one time with her, it's usually passive—like watching TV together.

I thought by now he would prioritize being present with our family and consistently wake up with us, but I'm losing hope that will ever happen. He leaves all the morning responsibilities to me. I'm also the primary parent who picks her up from daycare. For context, we both work from home.",1,1763902096.0,AITAH,7,0.67,False

Some examples:

#1 Nail biting

I've been biting my nails since I was a child, and still do it all the time. At one point in my life I used that nasty nail polish and that helped me stop for a month or so, but then I started again.

#2 Lip and gum biting
Again, all the time, I will bite and chew on both my lips and my gums. 

#3 Drugs

Started vaping when I was like 17, I could tell vaping was horrible for me so I stopped for a long time, recently switched to nicotine pouches(zyn) and that seems a lot better than vaping was. 

Started smoking weed when I was 18, still do it somewhat frequently but it's usually from a cart.

Anyways, the reason I do these things is heavily because of oral fixations, I honestly like the act of doing it more than the results of doing it sometimes. With zyns I love the burn, with vaping/smoking its inhalation (and associated feelings of drawing in the vape/smoke)

#4 Drinking 

All kinds of drinking, just love the act of drinking but if it burns, even better.

I drink coffee many times a day (straight black)
I'll drink tea but just not as often.

I drink beer, IPAs and regular (never lite)

When I drink liquor it's usually whiskey/scotch/tequila and I drink it neat, don't like mixed drinks, just straight liquor, again, love the burning sensation.

Drinking isn't a major issue for me, I like being tipsy but honestly hate being drunk.

#5 Gum
I went through a gum phase about a year ago, I was doing it so much that my jaw started hurting and my TMJ was going crazy (Oh yeah, I've had TMJ forever also, most likely because of the nail biting)

Anyways, I still chew gum but just try not to go as crazy on it as I was.


So yeah, I would like to work towards cutting out weed and alcohol because I just know it's unhealthy and I do it too much, but I think the core issue behind it is the oral fixations, and idk how to fill that void. 

Also would love to stop biting my nails and gums and lips and get rid of my TMJ.

So yeah, any advice here? ",1,1763901923.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

I usually like to stick with milks/creams. Sometimes cinnamon. I do have caramel and white chocolate sauce too to experiment with, but my daily driver is milk or cream.

My go-tos:
- Stormio
- Intenso
- Bianco Forte
- Maple Pecan

Special mentions (I remember enjoying these, but I never reordered):
- Pistachio Vanilla
- Golden Caramel
- Diavolitto

Pods I remember disliking:
- Pumpkin Spice Cake
- Peppermint Pinwheel
- Coconut Vanilla 
- Rich Chocolate

1p4ls14,https://www.reddit.com/r/ketogains/comments/1p4ls14/recent_gym_fatigue_on_ketogains_protocol/,Recent Gym Fatigue on Ketogains Protocol,"My height is 172 cm, weight 73 kg, and body fat is 20%.

I started the Ketogains protocol a month ago. When I used the keto calculator with a sedentary activity level, it gave me a target of 1500 calories, and that’s what I’ve been eating daily. Last month I was 80 kg with 24% body fat, so this is the progress I’ve made in one month.

Here’s my routine and meals:

*Morning:*

I start my day with 1 tsp ACV in warm water.

After 30 minutes, I take 1 scoop Isopure whey protein with creatine and 1 tsp salt.

After another 30 minutes, I have black coffee and head to the gym.

*Gym routine:*

After warm-up, I do intense weight training — deadlifts, squats, etc. Then I end with 30 minutes of light-pace treadmill and go home.

*Post-gym meal:*

4 eggs + a handful of spinach cooked in ½ tbsp ghee, with salt and pepper, plus another scoop of Isopure whey with 1 tsp salt (no creatine here; I only take creatine once per day).

*Meal 2:*

150g boneless beef + a handful of cabbage sautéed in ½ tbsp butter ghee.

*Meal 3:*

150g chicken breast + lettuce sautéed in ½ tbsp butter ghee.

I drink 6–7 liters of water daily and take psyllium husk once a day. I’ve followed the Ketogains protocol strictly for a month. I lost a good amount of fat and never experienced keto flu because I kept my sodium intake in check from day one.

*Now, here’s the problem:*

I’ve been training intensely for a month, but my muscle mass hasn’t increased, it’s only been maintained, despite progressive overload and adequate protein.

But for the last two days, something is off. I can’t lift the same weights at the gym. I feel weird dizziness same feeling when sugar is low. Cardio also feels impossible.

After researching, I realized I never supplemented potassium or magnesium. I avoided potassium because pharmacists warn that too much can be dangerous so I assumed I will take it once it is needed. People online use potassium chloride (NoSalt) or potassium glycinate, but the correct dosage is confusing like people are also satisfied with LMNT with very few potassium but they also say to take 3500mg elemental potassium?? so dosage is confusing for me. Also cofused about magnesium as well which type should I take? Threonate or something else?

So here are my questions:

1- Why am I not gaining muscle despite progressive overload and high protein?

2- What’s the correct potassium intake on Ketogains? And which form glycinate, chloride, etc.?

3- Why have the last 2–3 days been so bad at the gym? Is this an electrolyte issue?

After just one set of bench press, I feel an intense fatigue and dizziness as if my body is saying it can’t handle any more.",2,1763901697.0,ketogains,2,1.0,False

If you’re reading this, you probably got the same problem I got.

You hit 40, and suddenly your metabolism decides to retire. I work hard, I’m on my feet, but I got this ""spare tire"" around my waist that just won't quit. I tried the gym, but who has time for that? I tried those ""fat burner"" pills from the gas station, and they just gave me the shakes and made me feel like my heart was gonna explode.

I kept seeing ads for Mitolyn, talking about ""mitochondrial support."" It sounded like sci-fi nonsense to me. I usually think these supplement companies are full of it. But I read that it has no caffeine, and that caught my attention. I hate being jittery.

So, I decided to be the guinea pig. I ordered a supply to test it for two months. Here is the honest, no-fluff truth about what happened to my gut and my energy.

# What Exactly Is Mitolyn? (No Science Lecture)

Most weight loss stuff is just caffeine and pepper extract designed to make you sweat.

Mitolyn is different.

* **The Claim:** It targets your **mitochondria**. Think of mitochondria as the engine inside your cells. When you get old, the engine gets dirty and stops burning fuel (fat). Mitolyn claims to clean the engine so it starts burning fuel again.
* **The Ingredients:** It’s all plant stuff. Maqui Berry, Rhodiola, Astaxanthin. It sounds like a salad, but these are ""adaptogens"" meant to handle stress and energy.
* **The Vibe:** It’s not a stimulant. You don't take it and feel like you just drank five espressos. You take it and feel... nothing. At first.

# My 60-Day Experience Log (The Real Timeline)

I tracked this everyday because I wanted to see if I was getting played.

Weeks 1–2: The ""I Got Robbed"" Phase

I’m gonna keep it 100 with you. For the first two weeks, I felt absolutely nothing. No weight loss. No energy burst. I was standing on the scale every morning and the number wasn't moving. I was ready to call it a scam.

Note: The instructions say it takes time to ""saturate"" your cells. They weren't lying. If you quit here, you wasted your time.

Weeks 3–4: The ""Clean Fuel"" Feeling

This is when I noticed the first shift. Usually, around 2 PM, I need a nap or a hoagie to stay awake. That craving stopped. I just felt... steady. My energy was flat-lined (in a good way) all day. I wasn't crashing when I got home to the kids.

Weeks 5–8: The Belt Loop Victory

I put on my work jeans one morning and realized I had to tighten the belt one extra notch. I hadn't changed my diet. I hadn't started running marathons. But the ""bloat"" was gone.

The Result: I dropped about 12 pounds in two months. It ain't a miracle, but for doing basically nothing different? I’ll take it.

# The Pros and Cons (The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly)

I broke this down so you can see if it’s for you.

||
||
|**Pros (The Good Stuff)**|**Cons (The Bad Stuff)**|
|**No Jitters:** Zero caffeine. You won't feel cracked out.|**Slow:** Takes at least 3 weeks to kick in.|
|**Deep Energy:** Fixes that afternoon slump for real.|**Stock:** Often sold out on the official site.|
|**Belly Fat:** Actually targets the stubborn gut area.|**Counterfeits:** Lots of fake bottles on Amazon/eBay.|
|**Sleep:** Since there's no stimulants, you sleep fine.|**Patience:** You gotta take it every single day.|

# The ""Scam"" Warning (Crucial Safety Check)

Listen to me closely, because I don't want you to get burned.

Because Mitolyn is getting popular, the scammers are out in full force.

I saw a thread on a forum where a guy bought a bottle off a third-party site (like eBay) because it was cheaper.

He got scammed.

* **The Fake:** The pills inside were filled with rice flour.
* **The Risk:** You are putting unknown powder in your body to save a few bucks. Don't be a clown.

**The Solution:** You must order from the [**official manufacturer**](https://trends2026reviews.blogspot.com/2025/11/redirect-to-mitolyn-official-site.html)**.** That’s the only place that offers the 60-day guarantee and the fresh batch with the active ingredients. If the bottle doesn't have the seal, throw it out.

# FAQ: Questions I Get Asked

Q: Is it a fat burner?

A: Not in the traditional sense. It doesn't heat you up. It fixes your metabolism so your body burns fat naturally. It’s a ""metabolic support,"" not a ""burner.""

Q: Can I take it with coffee?

A: Yeah. Since it has no caffeine, it won't clash with your morning cup of joe. I take mine right with breakfast.

Q: Is it safe for older guys?

A: That’s the target audience, boul. It’s made for people over 40 whose engines are slowing down.

# Final Verdict

Is Mitolyn worth the hype?

Yes, but only if you are patient.

If you want to drop 20 pounds by Friday, go starve yourself (don't actually do that).

But if you want to fix your energy, get rid of the brain fog, and slowly melt that spare tire without feeling like a crackhead? This is the best stuff I’ve found.

In detail cause: this was because of Rhodesia had a system with **“white seats” and “black seats”**, but the way it worked was **heavily weighted in favor of** Whites (≈5% of the population) had a **fixed number of seats** in parliament. Blacks (≈95%) technically had seats too, but to qualify to vote for them, you had to meet **strict property, income, and education requirements**. Most Black people could **not** meet these requirements. In practice, this **excluded nearly all the Black majority**.

2. **Education** 

**• Rhodesia**: Segregated schools; whites had top-tier schools, Blacks had overcrowded, underfunded schools. 

**• Early Zimbabwe**: Massive expansion of schools; literacy jumped from \~62% → \~80–85%.  
**Winner: Early Zimbabwe**

**3. Healthcare**

* **Rhodesia:** Segregated and unequal; rural Black areas underserved.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Rural clinics expanded; life expectancy rose from \~59 → \~61/62. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**4. Economic Inclusion**

* **Rhodesia:** Whites controlled most skilled jobs, credit, and prime land; Black people weee  mostly laborers.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Blacks gained access to jobs, universities, civil service, and credit opportunities. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**5. Land & Agriculture**

* **Rhodesia:** 70% of best farmland reserved for \~250,000 whites; Blacks confined to poor “Tribal Trust Lands.”
* **Early Zimbabwe:** Early land resettlement programs began; Black farmers gained land for subsistence and some commercial farming. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**6. International Standing & Economy**

* **Rhodesia:** Sanctioned, isolated, military-focused, war-torn.
* **Early Zimbabwe:** International recognition, aid, loans, and investment; relative peace and stability. **Winner:** Early Zimbabwe

**Bottom Line**

For the **Black majority**:

* Rhodesia looked “economically strong” **only for whites**.
* Early post-independence Zimbabwe gave **millions of Black Zimbabweans better political rights, education, healthcare, land access, and hope**.
* So early Mugabe-era Zimbabwe was **far better for the majority than Rhodesia ever was**.

some common rebuttals: 

1. but Zimbabwe became poor after? (Congo, embargo’s) yes but that was later and that was mostly due to the Congo war and the trade embargos aswell as the history of land reform which unfortunately under Rhodesia people are not trained to use the equipment even though the society was highly illiterate it’s a completely different skill. 
2. what about today? GPN HDI wise it’s pretty much the same as it was during Rhodesia but now it’s more accessible for everybody and things aren’t racially skilled and the average Zimbabwe isn’t making extra nothing anymore. Don’t get me wrong. That is so bad but development doesn’t happen overnight

There’s a shockumentary called African Addidio and basically reaffirm the uncivilised Africans narrative needing to be saved by Europeans and or westerners, obviously perhaps the most acclaimed critic ever Robert Ebert called it deeply racist and it has been confirmed countless times about how the film conveys it phrases message to editing and by leaving out very important context. What’s even crazier is that the idea that said in its opening line “The purpose of this film is only to bid farewell to the old Africa that is dying and entrust to history the documentation of its agony.” After colonialism. 

But as with the case was Zimbabwe most if not all African countries have done better post colonialism then during it in fact colonialism brought little to Africa as a whole. To give 5 countries as an example. 

**Kenya**

* *Colonial period:* Education mostly for elites, literacy <20%, railways mainly for exports (tea, coffee), life expectancy \~40.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~81% today, life expectancy \~66 years, expanded hospitals, roads, and schools; poverty still \~36%.

*Nigeria* 

* *Colonial period:* Limited education for locals, focus on resource extraction, life expectancy \~40–45.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~62% today, life expectancy \~55–60, more hospitals and infrastructure, though inequality remains high.

**Botswana**

* *Colonial period:* Sparse education, low literacy (\~10–15%), life expectancy \~40, minimal infrastructure.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy \~88%, life expectancy \~69, strong economic growth from diamonds, expanded healthcare and roads, poverty \~20%.

**Tanzania (Tanganyika/Tanzania after 1964 merger)**

* *Colonial period:* Limited education, railways mainly for exports (copper, sisal), life expectancy \~40–45, few hospitals.
* *Post-independence:* Literacy rose dramatically (adult literacy \~77%), life expectancy \~66, expanded schools, hospitals, and rural infrastructure. Poverty remains (\~26%), but most social indicators improved.

Heck even Congo 

**Colonial period (Belgian Congo):**

* Belgian rule was extremely extractive and authoritarian.
* Education for the native population was minimal; literacy was very low.
* Healthcare access was poor, and infrastructure mainly served **mineral extraction and colonial interests**, not the Congolese population.
* Life expectancy \~38–40 years.

**Post-independence (DRC):**

* Initial improvements in literacy and health occurred, but political instability (Mobutu’s dictatorship, civil wars), corruption, and conflict **severely limited long-term development**.
* Life expectancy rose to \~61 years, literacy \~77%, but poverty remains widespread (\~73%), with major regional disparities.

Even just using common sense if Europe truly built so much infrastructure, and created such a high literacy rate, and created so much peace. Then why is there no infrastructure today in most of these places that the European supposed to be built? Why are there so many uneducated people? When Wide scale urbanisation happens it is very rare for it to completely turned back even under the worst situations these aren’t ancient ruins. 

Certain people like to portray the issues of the world on “vibes”. Things such as philosophy, inheritanct differences, culture or whatever boogie Man they can conjure. They’ll make it seem like it’s some kind of wide scale ideological battle where in reality it’s religious Corporal greed and the institutions that people serve that is causing a lot of of our issues and the simple answer is just the regulation of wealth.

How dare it be a good movie while containing the most disturbing subject matter known to man (a coffee table)?

How dare this movie be wonderfully shot and acted, with great characters, an incredibly realistic portrayal of a relationship, but I can't share it with others because of that bloody coffee table?

How dare this movie perfectly execute the tension of just wanting a human interaction to be over and done with? How dare it just give out its highest point in the plot in literally the first twenty minutes, while confidently sure audiences will keep watching because, really, how much more wild can it get from here?

I want to watch it again, but I just can't.

Damn this movie.

I recently came across some incredibly detailed instructions and ""expert recommendations"" for getting the best milk drinks out of the Nespresso Creatista machine. The advice was so solid that I felt it deserved a proper visualization to keep by the coffee machine for quick reference.

Huge shoutout and full credit to u/chipsdad for providing the original detailed specs and pro-tips!

This printable guide covers the main staples—Cortado, Flat White, Cappuccinos (small & large), Latte, and Latte Macchiato—with specific capsule recommendations, milk volumes, and exact foam settings.

It also includes those crucial Creatista Plus specific setting tweaks at the bottom (like adjusting the Cappuccino foam stiffness and the Flat White volume).

There’s this coworker of mine,  who started off super friendly and helpful. At first I thought he was just being nice, but lately something about the whole dynamic has been stressing me out.

Every time something goes wrong at work, even if it has nothing to do with me, he somehow finds a way to blame me or make little comments like “this wouldn’t have happened if you paid more attention” or “you’re too sensitive for this job.” He says it in a “joking” tone but it honestly doesn’t feel like a joke. It feels targeted.

The weird part is that outside of those moments, he’s perfectly normal. He jokes around, helps me with tasks, brings me coffee sometimes, and even told our manager I’m reliable and hardworking. It’s like he switches personalities depending on the day.

Yesterday he snapped at me in front of two other coworkers because I didn’t answer his message in five minutes. Later he apologized and said he was “just stressed,” but this is becoming a pattern and I’m starting to dread going to work because I never know which version of him I’m going to get.

I don’t know how to address it without making things awkward or starting drama, but I also don’t want to keep dealing with this hot-and-cold behavior.",1,1763900088.0,Advice,0,1.0,False

Seems like a weak point that could render the desk worse than the competitors (im thinking desktronic) within 5 years easily.

My understanding is that the desktop is metal, so without a mat it's not going to look or feel as good as wood or laminate.
