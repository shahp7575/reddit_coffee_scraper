1n22fn9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1n22fn9/possible_infidelity/,Possible Infidelity?,"Hey everyone, as my name implies, im using a throw account because my spouse is in this subreddit. Anyhow, I am in a dilemma where I feel conflicting feeling and need advice for next steps.

First, I provide context: A few years ago, my wife had to go away for work, for an extended period of time. During this time, she was in an environment that could be comparable to college dormitories. Everyone living in a single hotel, parties, infidelity, etc. According to her observations. 

This defibitely provoked some insecurities in me, but I tried my best to conceal them. As a result of me concealing them, as opposed to talking through them, I began to act resentful towards everything she would do. If she were hanging out with coworkers, I would feel put off and uneasy. If she wasnt calling me everynight, I would give her the cold shoulder the next morning. Petty things, which I knew were wrong and immature. Now, my insecurities started to ""leak"" when I noticed that she added a specific coworkee on social media. Weve always had this boundary of not adding coworkers of the opposite sex, because there were issues with coworkers crossing boundaries on both sides before. She chooses to cross this boundary and add a male coworker. This male coworker was someone she didnt know, from a different region within the same company, and they met through a mutual friend. Long story short, we fought over this. This will come back into play shortly.

Over time, we progressively fought more and more and my insecurities would continue to grow. It got to a point where we might fight and she ignores me for a day or two. Eventually, we had a major fight and she said she needed a break from ""us."" And ignored me for over a week. I did not agree to this. During this time, she deleted all photos of us on social media and only kept my name in her bios.  We would go on to make-up and continue our marriage. 

Fast forward a few months, she returns home and that is when things start to feel weird. When I picked her up, it felt like we were both very nervous. I shrugged it off, as we spent nearly 5 months apart. Then a few days after her return, we had sex. At first she tried to decline, but then initiated it a few minutes later. Once the sex began, she started acting weird. Laying there, almost petrified, staring at a wall, and not engaging in anyways. I kissed her and she lazily kissed back until we finished. After finishing, she said, ""that was good, its been so long, like 3 months no?"" I said, ""what are you talking about, you were gone for 5."" And she replied ""oh yeah youre right."" For whatever reason, I didnt think anything of it at that time. I was still too focused on the image of her just being zoned out during sex.

Fast forward a year and our marriage is doing great. Our bound is stringer than ever and everything feels very healthy. Then I get a text, ""ask your wife about ""jake"""" (protecting name for anonymity). Before confronting her, I realize that I recognize that name and remember that it was the male coworker she added on social media and sparked a fight. I go and check her phone (we both have access to eachother's phones) and I dont find much. I find a few texts from that time frame, of her friend saying things like, ""hey were going here, are you going to get a ride from jake?"" ""Jake is asking for you, he knows youre married, he just thinks youre a cool person"" and things of that nature. I decide to press the issue and i bring it to her. 

When confronted, she claims she doesnt even know who that is, but then backtracks and says ""oh yeah, that was Caroline's friend."" I just get straight ti the point and say ""what happened between you and him?"" She says nothing. I get frustrated and say ""did you suck his dick?"" To which she replies, ""no."" Did you two kiss? No. Did you fuck? No. Then its silent for a minuts and she starts, what i believe is, trickle-truthing. She says ""we danced together, but like in a group and we didnt touch or anything."" At this point, im so flustered and overwhelmed, my blood pressure skyrockets and i start to black out. That ends the night.

I wake up the next morning feeling drained and tryinf to process everything. She is in bed with me and asks ""is everything okay? Are we okay?"" I just say yes, get up, and walk out of the room to make coffee. The whole day she says that she feels like things are weird between us. I blow it off and keep insisting they arent. When in reality, im thinking back on minor details which make the incident feel much worse. Those detaiks are as follows...

1) While there, she began shaving her pubes in certain fashions and claimed it was for warmth. In all the time ive known her, shes always been waxed or shaved.

2) She insisted on staying on birth control and said it was to regulate her period. That, I believe, but given circumstances it makes me feel uneasy.

3) I sent her sex toys, so that we could have phone sex or so she could record videos. She used her dildo once for a video with me, but never the buttplug. Then, when she got home, she claimed she used it "" a lot."" Despite having never used it on video.

4) After returning home, I noticed she had deleted all photos from that time. They were there for a period of time, but after two weeks, they were gone.

5) she deleted ""jake"" from social media and claimed that she didnt want to be ""that girl."" Because he had a fiance and that she didnt want any sort of drama.

6) she would frrquently talk to me about work while there and mention male coworkers in her stories. Never once, was there mention of ""jake.""

Ultimately, I am looking for two things here. 1) do you think it is likely that she did cheat? 2) How should i move forward?

I would like to be able to reopen the topic, but its been years and in her eyes weve moved on from it.

Its just weird. Our marriage is so good now and I feel like she is such a loving mother and wife. Shes very good to me, but occasionally, i get nagging thoughts about this situation. Ive been feeling desperate lately.",1,1756353976.0,Marriage,1,1.0,False
1n22fmx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n22fmx/should_i_email_my_coworker/,Should I email my coworker?,"Hi Reddit, I need some perspective — I’m not sure if this is weird or too forward, especially considering cultural differences.

I have a coworker I’m really into. He’s Korean, a computer science nerd, and doesn’t talk to many people at work, but he talks to me — and his body language suggests he’s into me. That said, I’m not sure if he’s genuinely interested or just being polite, but I really enjoy talking to him. I’m also nerdy, so we click on that level too.

We’ve had some meaningful conversations at work:

One day around 3 PM (towards the end of the day), we had a 45-minute conversation — not during lunch — about coffee, dogs, and random things. During this, I playfully got a small touch in- a hand injury I had to take full advantave and feel his knuckle, and we both played along with it — it was very flirty and fun.

The next day, he came to my cubicle for about 25 minutes. Only the first 3 minutes were work-related; the rest was personal — we laughed, bonded, and talked about family, background, fitness, and shared experiences like the army.

He even gave me his email for an e-transfer at work. We haven’t spent time together outside of work, and I don’t have his phone number, but we do have a small coffee fund going.

Now I’m going on vacation, and I’m thinking of sending him an email from that address with:

A photo of a dog I showed him at work

A photo of a scenic coffee spot I visited

I want to send these because they reminded me of our conversations — the dog photo connects to our shared love of animals and playful chats, and the scenic coffee spot reminds me of our coffee talks at work (he talked about a stunning spot he went to and shared the story on teams when I said i was a coffee snob. It’s meant to be light, casual, and show I was thinking of him without being overbearing.

I really like him and don’t want to scare him. So I’m wondering:

Is this too forward or weird?

Could it be misinterpreted given his cultural background?

Am I rushing things?

I’d love honest opinions — I’m trying to gauge whether this is a sweet, harmless gesture or something that could backfire.",1,1756353975.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

I have two jobs, a child I homeschool and I’m in school myself. I have no interest in dating indefinitely and have never been in a serious relationship. I’m also celibate and don’t see myself dating at all for any reason.

With that being said, I’m not sure what’s happening here but it’s an interesting phenomenon that I’m finding myself in.

I started my current job two years ago and at the same time we hired a few guys to work in the back. I became friends with one of them in particular, who didn’t speak English, but we would use our phones to communicate. The only reason I was friends with him (initially) was to learn Spanish since I’m obsessed with taking trips to Miami but I get frustrated with not being able to speak to anyone down there. 

Anyways, he has always made it very obvious that he likes me which I found kind of offensive at first because he would slip in innuendos when I’d try to speak normally to him. But I eventually got used to it and found it kind of funny. He was goofy and it made me laugh.

Fast forward to about 5 months ago. He asks me if I’d get coffee with him, which I thought was pretty neutral/low pressure, and I said yes. (If he asked me on a full blown date I would have declined.)

Well that never happened. Nothing ever happens. Every week he tells me he’s in love with me and asks me to do something different (coffee, go for a walk, etc) I say yes. Nothing happens. It’s happened so many times, I stopped getting offended and it’s just funny. I say “wonder what he’s gonna add anything to his debt, because he owes me a lot of hang-outs.” 

The weekend is coming up and that’s when we work together. I’m going to say no this time and see what his reaction is. I don’t want to be rude to this person because outside of that, we’re really good friends. But I want to say “dude, just stop. It’s making you look stupid to keep making plans to hang out, then not doing them.“

At this point I’m kinda exhausted from talking to him anymore because it has turned into this, I think I should stop being friends with him altogether.

I have no problem keeping things platonic but I wouldn’t be opposed if something else happened, and he’s the one constantly pushing for it but never follows through. 

What should I do? Should I tell him I just want to be friends or should I ice him out? My other friends who I talk to less actually stick to the plans they make. ",1,1756353842.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False

1n22ces,https://www.reddit.com/r/water/comments/1n22ces/coffee_nerd_seeking_help/,Coffee nerd seeking help,"Hey folks,

I’m a bit of a coffee nerd. Pour overs and espresso’s are my daily morning ritual. Problem is, I live in the Black Hills of South Dakota where the water is hard. Like 400ppm hard. A month ago I finally installed a whole-home softener and an RO system under the sink. The RO setup has a “blend” valve so I can adjust how much RO mixes with the softened water. In theory, great idea. In practice… meh.

This past weekend I ran some tests. Old method = distilled water + Third Wave Water packets. New method = blended RO/softened water, dialed to ~60ppm. The result? The packet water was bright, complex, tons of flavor. The blended stuff tasted flat and muted in comparison.

So here’s my half-baked plan: order a lab kit, but instead of sending just the RO/soft blend, I thought about making my own concoction.. well kind of. Something like this: fill a jug with RO water from my sink (with no blend of soft), splash in a little unsoftened hose bib water (this is the only source that isn’t softened in my home now), self test until it’s in the 50–60ppm ballpark. Then send that to the lab. If it tastes better than my current blend (in a self made blind test), I could have a plumber run a bypass line up to my sink so I’m pulling “brew water” without having to mix packets into RO/Distilled water like a mad scientist forever.

My questions:
	•	Is this idea genius or insane (or both)?
	•	Is there a smarter way to get lab results that actually help me target a Third Wave profile?
	•	Has anyone here gone down the “RO + hose water cocktail” rabbit hole and lived to tell the tale?

At the end of the day, taste trumps numbers, but I’d love some science-minded eyes on this before I keep fiddling myself into madness.

TL;DR: Local water is liquid rock (400ppm). Softener + RO + blend valve = flat coffee. Thinking about mixing RO with a splash of hose water to hit ~60ppm and sending that to a lab. Am I crazy or onto something? I’ll likely be posting this in a couple coffee subs as well looking for any specific feedback I can find there. Appreciate any help you can give.

Adrian leaned back in his chair while his amber eyes remained

fixed on Noelle as she absentmindedly drizzled syrup over her

pancake.

“Stop staring and eat,” Noelle said with a laugh as she caught his

gaze.

Adrian smirked and rested his chin on his hand. “Can’t help it.

You’re prettier than breakfast.” Noelle rolled her eyes, but a

faint blush dusted her cheeks. “Flattery will not get you another

pancake.”

Before Adrian could respond, his phone vibrated on the table

and the screen lit up with Miles‘ name. Adrian let out a groan

while his smile faded as he picked up the phone.

“Do you have to ruin my morning already, Miles?” Adrian

grumbled, holding the phone to his ear.

“Good morning to you too, sunshine,” Miles replied, his voice

brisk. “I need you at AMN, now.”

Adrian’s brows furrowed. “I just got home last night. Can’t it

wait? I’m having breakfast with Noelle.”

Chapter 1

“It can’t wait,” Miles said firmly. “We just got an offer from Dela

Vega Productions. It’s huge, Adrian! The kind of deal people

would kill for. You need to hear this in person.”

Adrian pinched the bridge of his nose. He glanced at Noelle who

was quietly sipping her coffee but watching him with an

understanding smile.

“I’m not interested, Miles,” Adrian said while leaning back in his

chair. “I told you **I** want to spend time with Noelle. Whatever it

is, we can talk about it tomorrow.”

“No, we can’t,” Miles insisted with an unyielding tone in his

voice. “This is a once–in–a–lifetime opportunity. Dela Vega

Productions doesn’t just knock on doors! They only call when

they know you’re the best fit. You’d be crazy to ignore this.”

Adrian sighed heavily and ran a hand through his messy hair.

He looked at Noelle again, silently apologizing with his eyes. But

Noelle only smiled softly while nodding her head in silent

encouragement.

“Fine,” Adrian finally said but still a little reluctant. “I’ll be there

in an hour.”

“Make it half,” Miles quipped before hanging up.

Adrian set his phone down with a groan, rubbing his face with

both hands. “That man doesn’t understand the concept of

personal time.”

Noelle chuckled, reaching across the table to squeeze his hand.

“It’s okay. I know how important your work is. Go on and

prepare.”

Adrian sighed, standing up and walked around the table to

plant a kiss on the top of her head.”

At least let me drive you to the bridal shop you mentioned to me

last night,” Adrian said, his voice soft as he stroked her hair.

“You said you wanted to pick out your dress.”

Noelle’s lips curled into a smile as she looked up at him. “You

don’t have to. You’re already in a rush because of Miles, and I

know how much he’ll nag you if you’re late.“”

Adrian smirked, crouching down beside her chair so their eyes

met. “I can handle Miles. But you? You’re my priority”

Her heart softened at his words, but she still shook her head

gently. “I’ll be fine. Grace is meeting me there, remember? You

focus on this big project. We’ll have plenty of time later to argue

over lace and tulle.”

Adrian’s amber eyes narrowed in playful protest. “You’re really

going to pick a dress without me? That’s cruel, darling.”

Chapter 1

She chuckled, brushing her fingers along his cheek. “You’re not supposed to see the dress before the wedding anyway, Mr.

Blackwood. Isn’t that bad luck?”

“Superstition,” Adrian countered with a grin, but he sighed in surrender. “Fine. But I’m holding you to a full recap when I get

back.”

“Deal,” she said with a laugh, leaning in to press a soft kiss to his lips. “Now go before Miles calls again and yells at you.”

Reluctantly, Adrian stood, grabbing his jacket and keys. He

turned back to her as he reached the door. “Text me as soon as

you’re done, okay? And don’t let Grace pressure you into

picking something you don’t like.”

Grace stood outside of the bridal shop while keeping her eyes on

her watch. The soft clinking of her bracelets echoed faintly as

Chapter 1

she crossed her arms and tapped her heel against the pavement.

And when she spotted Noelle approaching in her usual shirt

and fitted pants, Grace couldn’t help but let out a light laughter.

“You know, you’re probably the only bride–to–be in the city who

shows up to pick a wedding dress looking like she’s here to run

errands.”

Noelle shrugged with a shy smile as she reached Grace. “What’s

wrong with being comfortable? I didn’t know I needed to dress

up to try on dresses.””

Grace shook her head, still smiling as she linked her arm with

Noelle’s. “There’s nothing wrong with it, Elle. I just… admire how

grounded you are. Most women would be showing off if they

were in your shoes.” She gestured down to Noelle’s modest

sneakers. “I heard Adrian spoilt you with everything.””

Noelle rolled her eyes as her smile softened. “Don’t remind me.

I’ve told him a hundred times to stop buying me things I don’t

need. Half the time, I feel like I have to scold him like a child.”

Grace let out a laugh. “Oh, I can picture that. But you know him,

he’s not just an actor. He’s practically a one–man empire. I swear,

Adrian thinks spoiling **you** is his personal mission.”

Noelle’s steps faltered slightly and glanced at Grace. “Empire?

What are you talking about?”

Chapter 1

Grace froze for a split second as she realized her slip. But she

quickly plastered on a nonchalant expression. “I just mean… you know, he’s a big deal. His projects, his influence… it’s a lot to

handle.”

Noelle frowned, clearly unconvinced but unwilling to press

further. “Well, I still wish he’d tone it down. I don’t need all of

that to be happy. Just him.”

Grace’s smile softened at her friend’s words. Noelle’s humility

and sincerity were exactly why she and Adrian adored her so

much. Looping their arms together again, Grace tugged her

toward the bridal shop. “Come on, let’s find you the dress of

your dreams before you talk yourself out of it.”

But the moment they entered, Noelle ended up gasping in utter

surprise. She then laughed nervously as her eyes darted around

the bridal shop. The gleaming chandeliers, racks of delicate lace,

and mannequins adorned in the finest silk gowns exuded

luxury at every corner. Her gaze landed on a dress with

intricate beading, and her jaw dropped when she spotted the

price tag.

“Wow… these are beautiful… and expensive!” she exclaimed, her

tone rising in mild panic. “Why would you bring me here?!”

Grace burst out laughing, shaking her head as she grabbed

Chapter 1

Noelle’s arm to steady her. “Shush, woman! You’re acting like

you’ve never stepped into a fancy shop before.”

“That’s because I haven’t!” Noelle whispered sharply, still

scanning the extravagant displays as if they might swallow her

whole. “I can’t afford anything here! Grace, I’m just a flower

shop owner. What were you thinking?”

Grace rolled her eyes dramatically, pulling Noelle toward a

nearby rack of gowns. “Oh, please. Did you really think Adrian

was going to let you spend a single cent of your own money on

your wedding?”

Noelle froze, blinking at her. “But… it’s my wedding. I’m

supposed to-”

“-Supposed to what?” Grace cut her off with a pointed look.

“Listen, Elle, Adrian loves you more than anything. If he had his

way, he’d probably buy you the entire shop just to see you

smile. You’re his world, so let him spoil you a little.”

Adrian leaned back in his chair while his amber eyes remained

fixed on Noelle as she absentmindedly drizzled syrup over her

pancake.

“Stop staring and eat,” Noelle said with a laugh as she caught his

gaze.

Adrian smirked and rested his chin on his hand. “Can’t help it.

You’re prettier than breakfast.” Noelle rolled her eyes, but a

faint blush dusted her cheeks. “Flattery will not get you another

pancake.”

Before Adrian could respond, his phone vibrated on the table

and the screen lit up with Miles‘ name. Adrian let out a groan

while his smile faded as he picked up the phone.

“Do you have to ruin my morning already, Miles?” Adrian

grumbled, holding the phone to his ear.

“Good morning to you too, sunshine,” Miles replied, his voice

brisk. “I need you at AMN, now.”

Adrian’s brows furrowed. “I just got home last night. Can’t it

wait? I’m having breakfast with Noelle.”

Chapter 1

“It can’t wait,” Miles said firmly. “We just got an offer from Dela

Vega Productions. It’s huge, Adrian! The kind of deal people

would kill for. You need to hear this in person.”

Adrian pinched the bridge of his nose. He glanced at Noelle who

was quietly sipping her coffee but watching him with an

understanding smile.

“I’m not interested, Miles,” Adrian said while leaning back in his

chair. “I told you **I** want to spend time with Noelle. Whatever it

is, we can talk about it tomorrow.”

“No, we can’t,” Miles insisted with an unyielding tone in his

voice. “This is a once–in–a–lifetime opportunity. Dela Vega

Productions doesn’t just knock on doors! They only call when

they know you’re the best fit. You’d be crazy to ignore this.”

Adrian sighed heavily and ran a hand through his messy hair.

He looked at Noelle again, silently apologizing with his eyes. But

Noelle only smiled softly while nodding her head in silent

encouragement.

“Fine,” Adrian finally said but still a little reluctant. “I’ll be there

in an hour.”

“Make it half,” Miles quipped before hanging up.

Adrian set his phone down with a groan, rubbing his face with

Chapter 1

both hands. “That man doesn’t understand the concept of

personal time.”

Noelle chuckled, reaching across the table to squeeze his hand.

“It’s okay. I know how important your work is. Go on and

prepare.”

Adrian sighed, standing up and walked around the table to

plant a kiss on the top of her head.”

At least let me drive you to the bridal shop you mentioned to me

last night,” Adrian said, his voice soft as he stroked her hair.

“You said you wanted to pick out your dress.”

Noelle’s lips curled into a smile as she looked up at him. “You

don’t have to. You’re already in a rush because of Miles, and I

know how much he’ll nag you if you’re late.“”

Adrian smirked, crouching down beside her chair so their eyes

met. “I can handle Miles. But you? You’re my priority”

Her heart softened at his words, but she still shook her head

gently. “I’ll be fine. Grace is meeting me there, remember? You

focus on this big project. We’ll have plenty of time later to argue

over lace and tulle.”

Adrian’s amber eyes narrowed in playful protest. “You’re really

going to pick a dress without me? That’s cruel, darling.”

Chapter 1

She chuckled, brushing her fingers along his cheek. “You’re not supposed to see the dress before the wedding anyway, Mr.

Blackwood. Isn’t that bad luck?”

“Superstition,” Adrian countered with a grin, but he sighed in surrender. “Fine. But I’m holding you to a full recap when I get

back.”

“Deal,” she said with a laugh, leaning in to press a soft kiss to his lips. “Now go before Miles calls again and yells at you.”

Reluctantly, Adrian stood, grabbing his jacket and keys. He

turned back to her as he reached the door. “Text me as soon as

you’re done, okay? And don’t let Grace pressure you into

picking something you don’t like.”

Noelle shook her head, amused by his concern. “I promise. Go on

Like, Spiritfarer or Hogwarts Legacy","Hey all, I’m looking for something that hits a similar note to Spiritfarer, Tiny Bookshop or Hogwarts Legacy, where the story motivates the gameplay systems, and not just vibes for vibes’ sake.

What I loved about Spiritfarer wasn’t the grief or emotional weight (tbh, I didn’t get that emotional lol but I loved the writing/plot), it was the satisfying gameplay loop: upgrading your ship, unlocking new buildings, farming, exploring the map, (not too much) fishing, progressing quests, etc.

I’m not looking for:
	
• Anything too grind-heavy with no ceiling like Stardew

• Overly idle or aesthetic-only games with no real stimulating gameplay like To The Moon/Coffee Talk

• Turn-based games - really not my thing 😞

What I am looking for:
	
• Cosy, structured progression (clear quests, upgrades, unlockables)

• Some form of resource gathering / farming / crafting

• A sense of narrative or worldbuilding

I recently 100%’d Spiritfarer, Hogwarts Legacy, and loved Tiny Bookshop, and I’m craving that feeling again, where you’re just immersed in a world but still doing something.

Any cosy games with that same satisfying rhythm with actual gameplay (not just pretty pixels/visuals)? Would really appreciate any recs that can help scratch that cosy grind itch 💛",3,1756352802.0,CozyGamers,3,0.8,False

""Micro-Habit"" Initiation Method: Break down your goal into extremely small tasks—so small that you can’t possibly give up. For example, if you want to develop the habit of ""reading every day,"" start with ""reading 1 page a day""; if you want to build an exercise habit, begin with ""doing 1 push-up a day."" These tiny actions come with no pressure and are easy to stick to, and over time, they will naturally form a habit through consistent accumulation.

	2.	""Environment Anchoring"" Method: Tie your habit to a fixed environment and use the environment to trigger action. For instance, if you want to develop the habit of ""drinking enough water every day,"" place water cups in visible areas like your desk, bedside, or living room coffee table; if you want to build the habit of ""evening reflection before bed,"" sit at your desk in the bedroom at a fixed time—once you’re in that spot, you’ll naturally start reflecting. Let the environment act as a ""reminder"" for your habit.

	3.	""Immediate Feedback"" Reward Method: Give yourself a small reward every time you complete a habitual action. For example, after sticking to getting up early each day, reward yourself with a cup of your favorite coffee; after keeping track of your expenses daily, treat yourself to 10 minutes of short videos. Immediate positive feedback reinforces the behavior, making it easier to maintain the habit.",1,1756352796.0,Procrastinationism,0,1.0,False

1n21zjx,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n21zjx/will_this_scare_my_nerdy_coworker/,Will this scare my nerdy coworker,"Hi Reddit, I need some perspective — I’m not sure if this is weird or too forward, especially considering cultural differences.

I have a coworker I’m really into. He’s Korean, a computer science nerd, and doesn’t talk to many people at work, but he talks to me — and his body language suggests he’s into me. That said, I’m not sure if he’s genuinely interested or just being polite, but I really enjoy talking to him. I’m also nerdy, so we click on that level too.

We’ve had some meaningful conversations at work:

One day around 3 PM (towards the end of the day), we had a 45-minute conversation — not during lunch — about coffee, dogs, and random things. During this, I playfully got a small touch in- a hand injury I had to take full advantave and feel his knuckle, and we both played along with it — it was very flirty and fun.

The next day, he came to my cubicle for about 25 minutes. Only the first 3 minutes were work-related; the rest was personal — we laughed, bonded, and talked about family, background, fitness, and shared experiences like the army.

He even gave me his email for an e-transfer at work. We haven’t spent time together outside of work, and I don’t have his phone number, but we do have a small coffee fund going.

Now I’m going on vacation, and I’m thinking of sending him an email from that address with:

A photo of a dog I showed him at work

A photo of a scenic coffee spot I visited

I want to send these because they reminded me of our conversations — the dog photo connects to our shared love of animals and playful chats, and the scenic coffee spot reminds me of our coffee talks at work (he talked about a stunning spot he went to and shared the story on teams when I said i was a coffee snob. It’s meant to be light, casual, and show I was thinking of him without being overbearing.

I really like him and don’t want to scare him. So I’m wondering:

Is this too forward or weird?

Could it be misinterpreted given his cultural background?

Am I rushing things?

I’d love honest opinions — I’m trying to gauge whether this is a sweet, harmless gesture or something that could backfire.",1,1756352582.0,dating_advice,1,1.0,False

1n21sm4,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1n21sm4,"Adventure Time: Picnic at the Edge of the World, Arizona","Drove out Woody Mountain Road, an easy (1/10) route out to an area nicknamed ""Edge of the World"" (actually called East Pocket) for a picnic and to try out my new ARB dual compressor (portable because our other vehicle is a Jeep). Aired down a couple miles in at Rogers Lake from 38psi to 25psi and the difference was amazing, making the ride far more smooth. While I often joke Woody Mountain Road is a Super Highway, it is a typical bumpy, washboarded forest road, so taking the edge off was quite nice. 

We'd played with airing down before up in Moab with someone else's compressor, which is what sold me on the idea. Trying it out on a road I'm really familiar with convinced me it was a great investment. We can air down and back up quickly enough even with a single hose to make it worth doing even if we're just headed out to go hiking. Adding fancy deflators and a decent gauge will make the task a breeze.

Monsoon storms recently arrived (several weeks late), so there were puddles to drive through, so I was happy to get my truck not just dusty but downright *dirty.* We took a little side trip on a road Trails Offroad lists as ""Woody Mountain Secluded Meadow"" to give the dog a run and look off the edge at Fernow Cabin. 

We had lunch on the slide-out tailgate at Edge of the World, overlooking the Dry Creek canyon complex and Sedona area rock formations like Cathedral Rock, Capitol Butte, and Coffee Pot Rock. We did a little more exploring and added a few trails we need to visit/revisit in the near future.

1n21sc4,https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1n21sc4/future_with/,Future with...,"In the last 20 years I've been poly 13 and mono 7.

As of today I've been divorced from husband almost 4 months, same amount of time I've been seeing someone new with poly in mind. I'm also almost 6 weeks postpartum with my second baby, with my ex husband. For us a good divorce was better than a bad marriage. The commitment wasn't lacking but compatability was. Communication was breaking down under the weight of alcoholism. We have known each other 20 years so we are blessed with a foundation of friendship. Both of us had separate experiences with poly and open relationships prior to dating, we decided to be mono as a conscious decision and i think it was a great benefit as we wanted to have children together, we were focused on them, and the IVF process.

The person I've been seeing has been my love puppy, my pseudo husband i see once a week, and he saved me from spiraling. A positive and sexy distraction i needed for my mental health. I didn't know what would happen when i had the baby, but he has been staying in touch and texting me everyday. We video call sometimes, for hours. And he's visited once since i gave birth bringing my favorite drinks, things he made, my favorite cookie, my favorite flowers. I realized he was taking notes over the months i mentioned my favorite things. 

He hasn't met my kids and i haven't met his, he's also divorced with kids, has a great coparenting relationship as well. He has always been mono and is just discovering poly, ENM, swinging and kink communities. This is an exciting time for him. It doesn't quite match up with my settle down energy. But the point is, i can hang, i am familiar and enjoy that lifestyle, albiet could take it or leave it most weekends. 

In my past open relationships I've always prioritized equality among partners, but most times I've had couple privileges, being one half of a partnership. In theory i don't like hierarchical standards but in practice i desperately want to be someone's person they come home to. I'm not a jealous person though, i adore having paramours around, i enjoy becoming friends with them, i can respect boundaries, i could be a part of a love triangle if invited, or tell my lover goodbye and have fun during a weekend orgy getaway,  i can enjoy a play party, and sometimes i just want to stay home and i don't get FOMO. 

My tendency is to ask to define things early on and ask people to commit. But after having a baby and getting divorced it feels strange to do, especially since things are good with this new person, he's really a good person, respectful, kind, emotionally intelligent, thoughtful,  and responsible. But i can't ignore the fact that i do really want a partnership, i want someone to choose me. So i keep thinking about it. 

I do need to tell my ex husband at some point about this new person, and soon, we see each other 3x a week and spend time together with our kids. 

And the person I'm dating, i think I'll just keep seeing him as long as it stays good. If i can keep my past habits at bay, and try something different, maybe he will be the first one to want to bring up commitment with me, maybe he will want to define what we are, maybe he will choose me. That's what i really want, that's why i usually ask people to commit early. 

I'm wanting to focus on family and art and gardening and sitting on the porch with my coffee, maybe buy a house in a couple years. And go to a good ol play party every few months. Maybe a little more often sometimes. But with my person, in my imagination for the future, we live together so likely arrive at the events together, but might not leave together every time and we know we can trust each other. We will have just as many exciting relationships together as we do apart. 

Anyway i wanted to share what I've had in my mind lately. Thanks for reading. ",1,1756351939.0,polyamory,3,0.6,False

Hi there,

I am a 33 year old guy from Michigan and I am hoping to meet someone genuine to connect with. I am open to friendship, dating, or just seeing where things naturally go. I am laid back, friendly, and always up for a good laugh. When the weather is nice you will usually find me outside camping, hiking, or spending time by the water. During the colder months I am all about staying in with coffee, a good book, or binging a series.

A little about me. I am 5’10 with an athletic build, green eyes, and brown hair. I do not smoke, and I drink socially. I try to live an active lifestyle and enjoy keeping busy but I also know how to slow down and enjoy the quiet moments.

What I am looking for is someone who is down to earth, fun to talk to, and open to building a steady connection without games or drama. I am very open minded when it comes to age and body type because I believe trust, communication, and a solid mental connection are what matter most.

I think life is better when you have someone to share it with, whether that means grabbing coffee, going for a walk, sharing stories, or even something more if the connection is right. If you are someone who values laughter, honesty, and just enjoying the simple things, I would love to get to know you.

I have to go with a high-scoring affair here, friends. Braves starter Cal Quantrill (5.51 ERA) has allowed 18 runs across his last 4 outings, and the Over has cashed with ease in 4 of Philly starter Aaron Nola’s (6.52 ERA) last 5 games. With Nola having allowed 24 hits across his last 3 starts, I can’t imagine Atlanta stays off the board here. Take the Over to hit, betting fam.

Imagine casting your vote while sipping morning coffee—using just an app on your phone. Sound like a dream? It could soon be a reality! With advancements in blockchain technology, we might just be on the brink of transforming how we vote.

### Key Points from the Article:

- **Trust Issues:** Election integrity is constantly plagued by allegations of fraud, tampering, and errors. Even when elections are conducted fairly, the public often doubts the process.
  
- **Blockchain Magic:** 
  - A public, immutable ledger that can securely record each vote.
  - Voters can verify their votes, eliminating room for doubt or tampering.

- **The Benefits of Blockchain Voting:**
  - **Transparency:** Results can be audited in real-time.
  - **Security:** Votes are securely recorded like transactions in digital currencies.
  - **Privacy:** Innovations like zero-knowledge proofs ensure you can verify your vote exists without revealing who you voted for.

- **Real-World Trials:** States like West Virginia and Utah have already tested limited blockchain voting systems, proving the tech can work.

### But, It's Not All Smooth Sailing:

While the potential is huge, adopting blockchain for voting isn't plug-and-play:
- **Access:** Not everyone has digital access, which poses a challenge.
- **Education:** People need to trust and understand how this tech works.
- **Legal Hurdles:** Current laws often don’t support blockchain voting.

### The Future of Democracy?

If successfully implemented, blockchain could:
- Reduce voter fraud
- Rebuild public trust in democracy
- Empower remote citizens to vote securely

This article raises vital questions about the modernization of our electoral systems. Are we ready for a significant upgrade to democracy?

Thinking of emailing a coworker while on vacation,"Hi Reddit, I need some perspective — I’m not sure if this is weird or too forward, especially considering cultural differences.

I have a coworker I’m really into. He’s Korean, a computer science nerd, and doesn’t talk to many people at work, but he talks to me — and his body language suggests he’s into me. That said, I’m not sure if he’s genuinely interested or just being polite, but I really enjoy talking to him. I’m also nerdy, so we click on that level too.

We’ve had some meaningful conversations at work:

One day around 3 PM (towards the end of the day), we had a 45-minute conversation — not during lunch — about coffee, dogs, and random things. During this, I playfully got a small touch in- a hand injury I had to take full advantave and feel his knuckle, and we both played along with it — it was very flirty and fun.

The next day, he came to my cubicle for about 25 minutes. Only the first 3 minutes were work-related; the rest was personal — we laughed, bonded, and talked about family, background, fitness, and shared experiences like the army.

He even gave me his email for an e-transfer at work. We haven’t spent time together outside of work, and I don’t have his phone number, but we do have a small coffee fund going.

Now I’m going on vacation, and I’m thinking of sending him an email from that address with:

A photo of a dog I showed him at work

A photo of a scenic coffee spot I visited

I want to send these because they reminded me of our conversations — the dog photo connects to our shared love of animals and playful chats, and the scenic coffee spot reminds me of our coffee talks at work (he talked about a stunning spot he went to and shared the story on teams when I said i was a coffee snob. It’s meant to be light, casual, and show I was thinking of him without being overbearing.

I really like him and don’t want to scare him. So I’m wondering:

Is this too forward or weird?

Could it be misinterpreted given his cultural background?

Am I rushing things?

I’d love honest opinions — I’m trying to gauge whether this is a sweet, harmless gesture or something that could backfire.",1,1756350904.0,dating_advice,3,1.0,False
1n21fba,https://www.reddit.com/r/DestructiveReaders/comments/1n21fba/1898_untitled_only_prologue_is_complete/,[1898] Untitled (Only prologue is complete),"This is the prologue to a story that I've made hundreds of drafts for, explored several writing styles, and run through almost a thousand ideas to find something I like. Here it is, rip it apart for me.

Stormy night. 2145 hours. February 18th, 1943.

Rain ticking against the windows of a small, family-owned café—quiet, low traffic. Chosen for privacy. I was waiting on a client.

Interior layout: three exits. Main entrance, kitchen fire door, and an employee access point—key card required. Security rating: low, but manageable. Four staff on duty. One waitress—mid-20s, overworked. Two cooks—occupied, heads down. One manager—positioned near the register, likely armed with nothing but protocol.

The ceiling was decorative. Molded plaster, some kind of vintage motif. Unnecessary detail. Meant to distract from the chipped paint and cheap tables. Someone wanted this place to feel like more than it is.

Didn’t work. But I respected the effort.

Then came the voices.

“God, look at him,” Julie purred, swirling her wine like she was at a gala instead of a corner café. “Now that’s a man with purpose. Young, sharp—just how I like them.”

Jessica didn’t even glance up from her cigarette. “Please. That coat is a fashion disaster. Looks like he’s playing dress-up in his father’s closet.”

Julie rolled her eyes. “You wouldn't recognize style if it slapped you with a silk glove. That’s not a coat—it’s a statement.”

“A statement that says, ‘I have no taste,’” Jessica muttered.

“Oh, will both of you shut up?” Holly cut in, barely blinking as she watched me over the rim of her coffee cup. Her voice was low, rich, the kind of sound that wraps around your spine and squeezes. “He could wear a burlap sack and I’d still want to crawl into it with him.”

Julie smirked. “Oh, Holly, must you always be so desperate? Honestly, let the poor man breathe.”

“Desperate?” Holly shot her a look. “Sweetheart, I’m not desperate. I just know what I want when I see it. And I want him. That jaw, those eyes… God, I bet he smells like danger and regret.”

Jessica scoffed. “He looks like trouble. Probably broods in dark alleys and writes bad poetry in his spare time.”

Julie laughed, flipping her hair. “So what? Trouble keeps life interesting. And let’s be honest, we’re not exactly spring chickens. A little young blood might do us good.”

“He’s not just young,” Holly murmured, voice softer now, almost reverent. “He’s alive. You can see it in the way he sits—like he’s calculating everything. Like he’s already undressed the whole room.”

At that, I rose from the booth, heading for the bathroom.

Julie leaned in, amused. “Oh Holly, you scared him off with that stare of yours.”

“Scared?” Holly smiled, slow and certain. “He’s just buying time. Mark my words—he’ll come back wondering what else I’ve imagined.”

I shut the bathroom door behind me, sealing off their voices. Stepped up to the mirror. Took inventory.

Eyes: light blue—sharp, almost clinical. Direct, unflinching. Hair: jet black, cut short for function, not fashion. Stubble: two days' worth, outlining the jaw and cheekbones. Not intentional, just the result of a packed schedule and shifting priorities. Still, it adds definition. Noted.

Tan undershirt—basic, worn, but clean. Black half-trench over it, tailored enough to pass, loose enough to move. Slacks match. Uniform of someone who needs to blend in, but still be taken seriously.

Build: lean, with slight bulk around the midsection. Not ideal, but acceptable. Keeps me from looking like a threat at first glance. That can be useful.

The women said I was handsome. Dreamy, even. I disagreed. Their assessment is likely influenced by lighting, posture, or the fantasy they’ve built around a quiet man in a dark coat. People see confidence and fill in the rest.

What I see is a man who’s functional. Capable. Efficient. Appearance: unremarkable, but not forgettable. Just the right amount of presence to get noticed when it matters—and ignored when it doesn’t.

Business done. I stepped out of the bathroom and back into the dim. My table was no longer empty.

My client had arrived—early by a few minutes or late by a week, depending on how you measured trust. He was seated, casual, but alert. Water, a bottle of beer, and a plate of fries already on the table. Likely ordered for both of us. Shared food builds rapport. Or at least the illusion of it.

I sat down. Time to work.

He sat across from me, the kind of face that made you look twice—less for charm, more for discomfort.

Nothing outright wrong, just… off. Features uneven enough to catch your eye, eyes dull from too many late nights. His hair was greasy, slicked back with too much product or no care at all. Pale skin with a few rough patches, the mark of a man who’d spent too long indoors, smoking too much.

His voice was dry and croaky, like it had been scraped raw by years of cheap cigarettes. Every sentence sounded like it cost him something.

Not someone you’d call pleasant company—but he had a presence, whether you liked it or not.

“Ah, you’re back,” he said, voice rough and dragging like it weighed on him. Fake disinterest, the kind you hear when someone’s trying too hard. “Hope your break was… pleasant.”

He slid a tan folder across the table. I opened it, scanning the missing deputy’s file—details precise, grim.

**--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**CASE FILE: DEPUTY MARLENE WARD**

**Badge No. 4829**

**Missing Person Report**

**Filed: February 16th, 1943 – 0800 Hours**

**Last Seen: February 13th, 1943 – approx. 2215 Hours**

**PERSONAL DETAILS:**

Name: Marlene Ward

Age: thirty-two

Height: 5’7”

Build: Athletic – trained, not showy

Hair: Chestnut brown, shoulder length

Eyes: Hazel, steady

Service Record: Clean. Disciplined. Two citations for bravery—one earned, one political.

**BACKGROUND:**

Transferred from the north end three months ago—brought in to assist with organized crime tracking. Familiar with the Bushers’ operation. Not afraid to step on toes. Last known assignment involved low-level surveillance on a warehouse near the docks. Nothing flagged at the time. Could’ve missed something.

**NOTES ON DISAPPEARANCE:**

Last seen leaving precinct alone. No sign of struggle at her apartment. Car was found two days later on 5th and Holloway, locked, no signs of forced entry. No prints but hers. Purse left inside. Weapon missing.

*Final communication:* one outgoing call at 2212 hours. Unlisted number. Trace came up empty.

No white rose at the scene. Which means either it wasn’t the Bushers—or it was, and they wanted it quiet.

**WORKING THEORY:**

Could be personal. Could be internal. Could be both. Ward didn’t play politics well. Made enemies in and out of uniform. If it’s the Bushers, they’re changing patterns. If it’s not, we’re dealing with someone who knows how to mimic silence.

Either way, she’s gone—and someone wanted her that way.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

“She’s been gone a few days,” he added.

I didn’t look up. “You think it’s the Bushers? They’ve been active lately.”

The Bushers were trouble with a name tag.

A family that ran the edges of town like shadows, their reputation built on whispered deals and broken promises. Not the kind to get their hands dirty—too smart for that—but their reach was long and fingers sticky.

They left a calling card—a white rose—at every scene, a twisted signature that was equal parts taunt and warning. People said the Bushers controlled the rackets from bootlegging to protection, making sure everyone knew who paid and who didn’t.

They were quiet, calculated, and ruthless. The kind of family that made you check your back twice and your front once.

He shrugged, voice low. “Reasonable guess. But the white rose they leave at crime scenes? Not at her last spot. Doesn’t confirm anything.”

I filed that away. Partial leads and empty symbols—standard.

“If you keep flipping through, you’ll find a file on her roommate,” he said, voice still scraping like sandpaper across pavement.

I turned the page.

New folder. Different name. Same weight.

Eleanor Price. Lounge singer. The kind of name that shows up in neon lights and whispered arguments. Roommate, possibly more. Details were thin, but the implication was loud.

I started reading.

**-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------**

**CASE FILE ADDENDUM: ROOMMATE OF DEPUTY MARLENE WARD**

Name: Eleanor ""Ellie"" Price

DOB: June 1st, 1915

Age: 27

Occupation: Lounge singer — The Velvet Finch, downtown

Address: Shared residence with Deputy Ward – 3B, 216 Calhoun Street

Last Interviewed: February 16th, 1943 – 1430 Hours

**PROFILE:**

Ellie Price — sharp dresser, quicker tongue. Works nights, sleeps days, and drinks in between. Voice like velvet soaked in gin. The kind of woman men lie to their wives about. She’s used to attention and knows how to control it.

Records come back clean—no priors, no associations on paper. But she’s no stranger to smoke-filled back rooms and names that don’t get printed in the papers. If there’s dirt, it’s buried deep or buried smart.

**CONNECTION TO WARD:**

Roommates for just over a year. Ward and Price met during an off-duty incident at the Finch—Ward broke up a fight, Price was collateral. Bond formed quick. Some say they were close. How close? Depends who you ask. Ward kept her private life exactly that—private.

Ellie claims she last saw Ward the evening of the 13th, around 8 p.m. Says Marlene came home, showered, changed into plain clothes, and left in a hurry. No mention of a destination. No hint of concern at the time. “She moved like she had a purpose,” Ellie said. “Didn’t say a word about it.”

Price reported Ward missing the next morning after she failed to return—says it wasn’t like her to disappear without a call. Cooperated with officers. Gave a full statement. Didn’t flinch.

**NOTES:**

Something in her story smells faintly off. Not a full lie—just… filtered. She knows more than she’s saying. Whether it’s to protect Ward or herself is still unclear.

She’s connected. And she’s surviving. Which means she’s learned when to talk—and when to keep her mouth shut.

**Flagged for follow-up.**

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“There isn’t a lot here,” I said, flipping the folder shut, “but it’s enough to start. I’ll run it my way. We’ll find your deputy.”

He nodded. “Perfect. She’s one of our best, Damien. It’s best you find her soon.”

The beer was warm by then. Fries gone, water untouched. We stood, silent agreement passing between us. The kind that doesn’t need words—just pressure.

We paid the bill and walked out in different directions. Files under my arm. Rain still coming down. Case in hand.

Another missing face in a city full of them.

The rain followed me out of the café, steady as a clock I couldn’t shut off. Streets slick, lamps buzzing like they were ready to give out. I pulled the collar of my coat higher and kept moving.

Ward was gone. Maybe buried under a lie, maybe still breathing somewhere she shouldn’t be. Either way, she wasn’t the kind who vanished easy. That made her worth finding—and dangerous to whoever had a hand in it.

The Bushers liked to leave roses. This time, they hadn’t. That meant something, and I intended to find out what.

First stop was her apartment, then the Velvet Finch. A deputy with enemies and a singer with secrets—one missing, one lying, and both tangled up in something bigger than either could face alone.

The city had its way of swallowing people whole. My job was to dig through its teeth and see what it spat back out.

And I had a feeling this case wasn’t just about one missing deputy. It was the start of something else—something that would drag me deeper than I cared to go.",1,1756350842.0,DestructiveReaders,0,1.0,False

We joked and laughed. He gave me a suggestion for a coffee fund at work. I am a coffee snob and was all over it.

Next day I made a treat for the coffee day in a few days, I made biscotti. Offered it to him a day earlier, he said he would try it. He came to my cubicle for the first time, I had the biggest smile on my face. We stood in the lunch room at 3pm for 45 minutes. Body language was there. He told me about a hand injury he had so obviously I had to touch his hand to see what he meant. I was playful. He combed his hands through his hair a few times. Eye contact was unbelievable.

Next day he came to my cubicle for 25 minutes to talk about work for 3 minutes out of that, then really about himself and me. I know i have to tread lightly bc work but im not concerned.

When we initially talked on teams and I mentioned I was a coffee snob he shared a coffee story with me. He went on vacation a while back with friends, had coffee on a mountain with unreal views. I asked him for a picture but he said it was on his phone and thst was in the other room bc we dont have them at work.

For the coffee stuff I have his email to e transfer him money (group coffee fund). I transfered him.

Im on vacation for the next 2 weeks and want to intentionally email him a dog photo of the pup i showed him initially but now ill see the dog jn person (sisters dog - we both love dogs) and a photo of a scenic coffee spot of me and the dog.

Is this weird? This man is very very nerdy. A computer science dude. Keeps to himself and told me he doesnt talk to many people at work. But hes talking to me. I think it would be cute as hell. He is from Korean and im not familiar with the culture. Would that be seen as too forward? Weird?

Would you be into this?

1n218jf,https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1n218jf/aita_my_familys_going_through_a_lot_im_the_only/,"AITA? My family’s going through a lot. I’m the only non-problematic one, yet somehow I’ve found myself at the receiving end of my mom’s stressed out outbursts. And I finally spoke back.","For context, my brother was recently asked to leave his school due to an angry, subtly threatening text he sent a classmate regarding some stupid video game. The classmate’s parents escalated  the situation gravely, and it ended in the school asking my parents to pull my brother out. The situation was exhausting for the family as a whole, but primarily my mom since she was the one dealing with the police, school, parents, etc. This was around a month ago, and since then, it’s been me listening to her rants and vents, offering as much support as a fifteen-year-old girl can. Two weeks ago, school started up again for my brother and I. For the first week, my dad took me to school. He lives across the country and visits for important events, including the first day of school. He’s punctual like I am, and likes dropping me off early at school, which is fine because I like being early. However, he flew back to where he lives on Saturday, leaving my mom on drop-off/pick-up duty. 

When my mom takes me to school, I already know I have to do all the morning chores so all she has to do is get herself ready, otherwise we’ll be late (make her coffee, walk the dogs, make sure my brother’s packed, things like that). And that’s what I did. But my mom still managed to take too long getting ready and dropped me off literally as the late bell was ringing. So, on Tuesday, I woke up even earlier. Did everything I had to, made sure she’d woken up on time, and waited in the car. She had me waiting in the car for twenty minutes and dropped me off after the late bell. When she picked me up, I asked her if she could please drop me off in time, because another tardy would result in me having a detention. She told me she “didn’t have to live by my schedule.” ???? I didn’t decide school started at 8. Trust me, if I could start school later, I would. I just didn’t want to get penalized for being late when I’m doing everything right. I didn’t want to argue, but she went on about how ungrateful and bratty I was. She was practically talking to herself, riling herself the entire car ride home. I hadn’t said a word, and was trying to identify what was wrong with what I’d said. She told me that by my age, I should be “figuring my own shit out” and starting to return the favor she’s done of raising me for fifteen years. I’m not legally allowed to drive, and I have no money, so I don’t know how to “repay her” at all. I’d love to hitch a ride to school, but nobody from my school lives near me, and I live practically on the water so my house isn’t on the way to school for anybody. On top of that, there’s no busses from where I live since school’s only about four miles away and shouldn’t be such a drag for parents to drop off their children. She spewed out insults that targeted my insecurities the whole way home, and in situations like these, I tend to get emotionally detached. She’d tell me she wished I wasn’t born and I’d just shrug my shoulders and mutter a “my bad” which just seemed to ruffle her feathers even further. 

I tried to explain to her that she had no idea what a bad child was. I have good grades, moral friends, healthy and legal hobbies, and I never, ever talk back or give any kind of attitude. She called me a liar, and when I asked her to give me an example, she couldn’t and changed the subject. We got home, and I told my mom I would do all the work if it meant she could just get me to school on time. But she took serious offense to that, and told me she didn’t have to do any of what she does for me, and that if I was so dead set on getting to school on time, I could figure it out myself because she was done doing everything for me (taking me to school twice). I asked around for anybody willing to give me me a ride, but picking me up from where I live would add fifteen minutes to any trip to school for them, and nobody offered. So, I had to resort to my bike. It’s rather old, but what option do I have? 

I told my mom not to worry, and that I’d figured it out. She didn’t care.

This morning, I woke up extra early. I walked my dogs, made my mom’s coffee, and prepared my brother’s lunch. I was gone before she woke up. Biking with two backpacks—a school one and a volleyball one—was really difficult, but I had to prove to my mom and myself that I didn’t need her, and she didn’t have to worry about me anymore. It was four miles and around 25 minutes, so I endured it without complaint. I arrived to school glazed in sweat, but early, just how I like it. I freshened up in the bathroom; changing into my uniform, washing my face, and doing my makeup. 

I was already burning out from just school and volleyball, so piling biking eight miles a day on top was damn near my last straw. My usual energy at school was gone, and I didn’t bother explaining to my friends why I was miserable when they asked. I found myself losing motivation to interact with my peers, and even considered skipping a class, which I'd never done before. I had school, practice, and conditioning, then biked the second four miles back home. I got home before my mom arrived from work, and stayed in my room. I heard her come into the house with my brother, and she never called me for dinner, but I heard the clinking of plates and smelled the pasta. I didn’t go out, though.

Just a few minutes before writing this, my mom barged into my room, yelling about how I thought I was so special for not needing her. I think she’s pissed I can manage without her at fifteen years old. She called me an asshole and all sorts of obscene things I can’t say on here, before storming out saying she didn’t want to see me anymore.

And I could make that work. Leave the house before she wakes up, arrive before she gets back, and do homework in my room until it’s time for bed. With my bike, I have the freedom to go wherever I want. I can walk to Starbucks with my friends after school without having to tell my mom. I can go to the mall. I can be on time to school. But the distance by bike is something I’m yet to accustom myself to, because the bike ride to and from school leaves me slick with sweat, gross, thirsty, and exhausted.

I understand that my mom is stressed and super busy, but I can’t grasp why she has to be so angry at me. She makes my life miserable sometimes. Am I doing something wrong? How can I change? How can I fix my life while navigating my mom? Am I somehow the A-hole and am just not seeing it?",1,1756350288.0,AITAH,2,1.0,False

Rating scale showed at the end.  
  
🔥 Apple Pie Aerocano: Pass (8/10)  
  
This drink is a definite pass for its creativity and deliciousness. It's a whimsical mix of sweet, tart, and a hint of bitter, with the coffee blending perfectly with the ""apple pie"" flavors. The cinnamon sugar rim adds a wonderful hint of contrasting texture and really elevates the drink. The only drawback is the portion size, which feels a bit small for the price.  
  
🔥 Matcha Strawberry Milk: Conditional Pass (6/10)  
  
The matcha strawberry milk is a solid conditional pass. It's a good and inoffensive drink that will likely please most people, though it is a bit pricey for what you get. The matcha itself is good, but not outstanding, while the velvety milk is a highlight. The strawberry flavor is just okay, making the drink good, but not spectacular.  
  
🔥 Tater Tots: Death Note (4/10)  
  
The tater tots get a firm death note. For the price, you would expect some creativity or innovation, especially given the care put into the drinks. Unfortunately, this dish is just a plain bowl of tater tots with ketchup. To make matters worse, they were slightly overcooked, making the outer shell a bit too tough.",2,1756350164.0,PHFoodPorn,0,1.0,False

After buying the bike life changed and it ended up getting garaged for about 2 years. I recently cleaned it up and hit it with the maintenance package and took it for a few rides. I love this bike and its looks. These short rides restarted my joy for wanting to get out and ride.  I just don’t have any true practical use for this bike other than the occasional weekend ride for fun and only put a total of 500 miles on the bike, so I put the bike up for sale. I have got a serious buyer now and I am having a lot of doubts about keeping it or selling it and getting something a little more practical. 

I have always wanted a mini moto so I was thinking I might just sell this bike and downgrade to a Honda Super cub or Honda trail 125. A common thing you hear people say is “you’ll want to upgrade to something faster after X amount of time!”. I kind of feel like having a smaller bike would be a relief. Not to have to worry about going to crazy on the throttle or even deal with a clutch sounds like a joy. It seems like a more logical fit for how I plan to ride. I rarely go fast and still have the anxieties of not being able to perform if something were to happen. I have this dumb thought of using this bike to DoorDash as a good excuse to earn extra money and get out and about. I feel like I’d be more likely to take this small bike instead of a “real” motorcycle to the coffee shop or local spots. I don’t have friends that ride or anything like that. 

I only have a total of about 2 years of riding experience. Honda Cbr600 F3(first bike @ age 21 lol) and then this Interceptor 650 would be my second bike(@35). CBR600 was my only vehicle for a year so I had to ride when I had to go somewhere. Sold that after a year and didn’t have a new bike until this 650. I really only have experience on these two machines so it’s hard to judge if a 125 is going to be disappointing.

1n214id,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1n214id/why_wont_you_look_at_me/,Why Won’t You Look At Me,"“Why won’t you look at me anymore?” my wife pouted. 

Sweat beads lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my eyes fixated on the newspaper that shielded my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.
 
“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg. 

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged 

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the *real* her. Because the person sitting before me today was *not* my wife. 

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below. 

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she *has* to know, right? 

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,” 

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view. 

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms. 

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear. 

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I love my wife. I miss my wife. Lord, forgive me for what I’ve done to my wife.

**1. Parse the Odds: A Tale of Two Teams, One Slightly Less Doomed**  
The KBO showdown between the KT Wiz and Lotte Giants is a statistical tightrope walk. On the moneyline, the Giants are the faint favorites at **-111** (decimal: 1.83, implied probability: **54.6%**), while the KT Wiz hover at **+105** (decimal: 1.91, implied **52.3%**). It’s like choosing between two slightly less terrible Uber drivers: both might get you lost, but one has a slightly better Yelp rating.

The spread? The Giants are -1.5 (-150, implied **60%**) and the Wiz are +1.5 (-400, implied **80%**). That line feels like a cruel joke—betting on the Giants to outscore a team by 1.5 runs is like betting your toddler will eat *more* vegetables than a vegan. The totals are a clean 8.0 runs, even money (1.87 odds). If you’re feeling spicy, the Over and Under are as balanced as a Korean BBQ platter—equal parts protein, equal parts chaos.

**2. Digest the News: Singers, Retirees, and a Hamster Wheel of Drama**  
Let’s unpack the “news” here. First, the KT Wiz and Lotte Giants are technically *not* the teams in the retirement tour article (that’s Samsung vs. Doosan), but we’ll let it slide. Still, the fact that O Seung-hwan—the “final boss” of Korean pitching—is retired from action but training with his team adds a bittersweet layer. It’s like your favorite coffee shop barista retiring but still showing up to make lattes… just to watch.

Meanwhile, the YouTube broadcast features trot singer Lee Chan-won hyping the KT Wiz and K-Will cheering for the Giants. Imagine a cooking show where Gordon Ramsay and a guy named “Will” argue over whether your scrambled eggs

# Choosing The Right Coffee Beans

Brewing low acid coffee starts with the right beans. Picking the correct variety can reduce acidity. This choice is crucial for a smoother cup. Let’s dive into the best options available for low acid coffee enthusiasts.

# Selecting Low Acid Varieties

Some coffee beans naturally have lower acidity. Opt for beans grown at lower elevations. These beans often have milder flavors and are less acidic. Sumatra and Brazil are regions known for low acid beans. They produce rich, earthy coffee with minimal bite.

Consider trying coffee labeled as “low acid.” Brands often offer specific varieties for sensitive stomachs. They focus on reducing acidity without sacrificing taste. Experiment with these options to find your preferred flavor profile.

# Organic Vs. Conventional Options

Organic coffee beans can offer a cleaner taste. They are grown without synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. This can enhance flavor and reduce potential irritants. Organic options are often available in low acid varieties.

Conventional beans might be more accessible. They can also offer diverse flavor profiles. Comparing both can help you decide based on taste and health priorities. Many coffee lovers enjoy the depth of flavor in organic beans.

First dates can feel like a mix of excitement and nerves. You want to make a great impression, keep the conversation flowing, and avoid that dreaded awkward silence. 

But let’s be real—sometimes finding the *right* thing to say feels harder than it should. 

That’s where conversation starters come in. Having a few reliable topics in your back pocket can turn a stiff, formal date into something natural, fun, and memorable.

Discover 12 conversation starters to break the ice on a date, along with tips, examples, and best practices to help you relax and connect. 

Whether you’re shy, inexperienced, or just want to keep the night interesting, these conversation ideas will make things smoother.

# 1)) Ask About Their Favorite Travel Experience

Travel is a safe, exciting, and universal topic that sparks curiosity. People love sharing stories about places they’ve been or destinations they dream about. 

This kind of question also gives you a glimpse into someone’s sense of adventure, lifestyle preferences, and even their values.

Tips to use this starter effectively:

* Instead of asking “Do you like to travel?” (which often gets a yes/no answer), try something more specific: *“What’s the best trip you’ve ever taken?”*
* Listen for details you can build on. If they mention hiking in Peru, you can ask about what inspired them or what food they tried there.
* Be prepared to share your own travel story as a way to keep the exchange balanced.

Example Swipe:

* “If you could get on a plane tomorrow with a free ticket, where would you go and why?”

This approach opens doors to lighthearted banter and shared excitement about future adventures.

# 2)) Talk About Food Favorites

Food is always a winner because it’s relatable, sensory, and fun. Everyone has opinions about what they like to eat, where they enjoy dining, and what new flavors they’d like to try. 

On a date, food talk also sets up opportunities for planning future outings together.

Checklist to make this topic engaging:

* Ask about their favorite type of cuisine: “Are you more into sushi nights or comfort food?”
* Get playful with “Would you rather” food scenarios: “Would you rather give up coffee for a year or never eat pizza again?”
* Find common ground—if you both like Italian food, you can naturally suggest trying a local spot on your next date.

Best Practice: Keep food talk lighthearted. Avoid launching into strict diets, calorie counts, or controversial food trends unless they bring it up first.

# 3)) Share Funny or Awkward Childhood Stories

Humor is one of the best icebreakers. When you open up about a silly childhood memory, you make yourself relatable, approachable, and easy to talk to. 

This type of conversation quickly builds comfort and shows that you don’t take yourself too seriously.

Ideas for stories to share:

* The first time you tried to impress your crush in middle school.
* A family tradition that seemed weird as a kid but hilarious now.
* Embarrassing fashion choices from your teenage years.

Pro Tip: After sharing your story, ask them: *“What’s one funny or awkward memory from when you were younger that still makes you laugh?”* This permits them to laugh at themselves, too.

# 4)) Ask About Their Hobbies or Passions

People light up when they talk about what they love. Hobbies, passions, or creative outlets are safe ground to uncover their personality, interests, and lifestyle. 

It’s also a way to find out if you share common activities.

Tips for digging deeper:

* Instead of simply asking, “What do you do for fun?” phrase it like: *“What’s something you could spend hours doing and never get tired of?”*
* Ask follow-ups: If they say painting, ask how they got started or what style inspires them.
* Share something you’re into, even if it’s simple, like hiking or gaming, to keep the exchange mutual.

Warning: Don’t judge or dismiss their interests, even if they’re not your thing. Showing genuine curiosity is what matters.

# 5)) Discuss Movies, Shows, or Books They Enjoy

Entertainment is an easy win for conversation. It’s light, fun, and can spark debates or laughter without too much pressure. 

You’ll quickly see whether they enjoy comedies, thrillers, rom-coms, or documentaries, and that insight can help you understand their personality.

Ways to make this topic flow:

* Ask: *“What’s the last movie you saw that actually stuck with you?”*
* Bring up current shows or classics to see if you share tastes.
* If they love books, dive into genres or authors.

Engagement Hack: Turn it into a playful game: “If you could only watch one show for the rest of your life, what would it be?”

# 6)) Explore Their Dream Job or Career Goals

This one works best if you keep it light and avoid making it feel like a job interview. 

Many people enjoy talking about their ambitions, career paths, or even side hustles. It also helps you learn what drives them.

Best Practices:

* Ask about passions, not positions: *“If money wasn’t an issue, what would you be doing with your life?”*
* Be encouraging—showing genuine interest makes people feel seen.
* Share your own vision for your future, even if it’s not perfectly figured out.

This conversation can deepen the connection by revealing values and dreams beyond surface-level chatter.

# 7)) Talk About Music

Music connects people instantly. Asking someone about their favorite bands, concerts, or playlists can turn into hours of conversation. 

It’s also a natural way to discover shared vibes.

Swipe Examples:

* “What’s a song you could never get tired of hearing?”
* “Do you have a concert you’ll never forget?”
* “What’s your go-to playlist when you’re working out or relaxing?”

Pro Hack: If you discover shared music tastes, suggest making a joint playlist as a fun way to connect after the date.

# 8)) Ask About Pets or Animals They Love

Pets are often an emotional topic. Whether they have a dog, cat, or even dream of owning a pet one day, asking about animals can warm up the atmosphere quickly.

Ideas to make this fun:

* “Are you a dog person, cat person, or neither?”
* Share a funny pet story from your own life.
* If they don’t have pets, ask about animals they admire or would love to have.

Checklist:

* Be careful not to dominate with endless stories about your pet—balance is key.
* If they light up about their pet, ask to see a picture. This creates a moment of bonding.

# 9)) Bring Up Bucket List Adventures

Bucket lists are naturally exciting to talk about. They reveal someone’s sense of adventure, curiosity, and life goals. 

Plus, these conversations create opportunities to laugh, dream, and even discover shared ambitions.

Starter Questions:

* “What’s one thing you absolutely want to do before you turn 40?”
* “If you had unlimited time and resources, what’s the first adventure you’d chase?”

personalities Use this as a way to gauge compatibility. If their idea of adventure is skydiving and yours is reading in a mountain cabin, that’s still fine—it just gives you insight into each other’s personalities.

Games are underrated as conversation tools. A light round of “Would you rather” questions can break the tension, spark laughter, and reveal quirky details about someone’s personality.

Examples of fun prompts:

* “Would you rather never use social media again or never watch TV shows again?”
* “Would you rather live by the beach or in the mountains?”
* “Would you rather always have to sing instead of speak, or dance everywhere you go?”

Best Practice: Keep it playful and avoid extreme or uncomfortable questions. This is about breaking the ice, not crossing lines.

# 11)) Ask About Their Family or Upbringing (Lightly)

Family talk can be meaningful, but you’ll want to keep it light early on. Asking about someone’s background or upbringing shows genuine interest without being too heavy.

Examples:

* “Where did you grow up? What was it like there?”
* “Do you have siblings? What’s your relationship like?”
* “What’s a family tradition you still keep?”

Warning: If they seem uncomfortable, change the topic quickly. The goal is connection, not pressure.

# 12)) Talk About Future Plans and Life Goals

Ending with a forward-looking topic makes the date feel inspiring and optimistic. 

It helps you both imagine what’s possible and creates a sense of shared momentum.

Ideas to keep this upbeat:

* “What’s something you’re looking forward to in the next few months?”
* “What’s a goal you’ve set for yourself recently?”
* “If you could learn one new skill this year, what would it be?”

Tip: Keep it balanced. Don’t interrogate them about marriage or kids on a first date, but do explore the lighter side of dreams and ambitions.

# Conclusion

Breaking the ice on a date doesn’t have to be nerve-wracking. With these 12 conversation starters, you’ll always have a way to keep the energy flowing, avoid awkward silences, and build a real connection. 

The key is not just asking questions but listening, following up, and sharing a little bit of yourself, too.

Great conversations aren’t about perfection—they’re about presence. Stay curious, stay open, and let the conversation unfold naturally.",1,1756349207.0,LifeStylenaireLove,0,1.0,False

McDonalds Pet Peeve Edition (USA),"So I’m listing a few of my huge things that really got me frustrated while at work and they are in NO PARTICULAR ORDER, but I want to see if I’m going insane here or if you all feel me here:

1: The plastic on the creamer is there still when it’s cut or the creamer isn’t cut short enough. I don’t care who changes it or what but if you’re going to change it PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD MAKE SURE THE PLASTIC IS REMOVED AND ITS CUT PROPERLY! You never know when inspection is coming and if that’s there and you don’t catch it then whoops there goes points out the door for one stupid mistake.

2: Things going missing or you can’t find anything when you go to open service/grill. So there is a time where I went to open service and I went to get all the things I needed to open and I was missing a few things, the lemon container that I LOVE to use and the McCafe creamer drain where I can sit the cup for iced coffees and oatmeal on so I don’t make a huge mess. Like if you’re going to close the store please make sure EVERYTHING is put away CORRECTLY and WHERE IT BELONGS. And to my unfaithful surprise I heard both was thrown away and god forbid I was mad about it since I have to like be extra careful to not a mess.

3: This is my biggest one and I’m listing it last so here goes, the whole restaurant is a huge mess and nothing was cleaned or stocked before closing the store. There was a HANDFUL of times where I’d go to open for the morning and when I’d walk in I was shocked ( in a very bad way ) the whole restaurant was left a huge mess and I spent my ENTIRE prep time cleaning and opening service at the SAME time. Mind you I have to brew all the tea and coffee make sure THINGS are stocked and ready to go in both McCafe and front line so I can have a swift opening and all. Like how come nothing was done when the store had ENOUGH closers to do shit? Like I 100% hate the one closing manager bc of this. How can anyone consider that clean and a proper close like ngl she needs either written up or fired she’s did this multiple times leaving the store a mess and clearly no one isn’t DOING anything about it?

Now you all tell me am I alone going insane or am I not alone I figured I share my most frustrating pet peeves I’ve developed while being there.

No connection. Just like I’m watching an old movie.","I can’t really explain it but it’s as if my whole sense of reality is gone. I’m not familiar to anything anymore. I’ll remember little fragments of myself, and then it’s gone. That flow of experience I used to have, is gone.

I don’t feel time passing, what season it is, or how many hours pass in a day. I don’t feel grounded at all, but I’m not anxious or panicked. I will get these “mental” anxiety loops but never panic. It’s like my body has no response to anything - music, memories, thoughts, interactions with others. 

The only time I feel a little bit is when I get angry at something, but I still don’t feel like myself. It’s like I’m observing someone else get angry. And it doesn’t last. It’s like a flicker then gone. 

I started having intrusive thoughts again tonight that I could just disappear or go crazy. But I don’t panic, I just have the thoughts but don’t feel the fear in my body. My body basically has no reaction to anything anymore, internally or externally.

I don’t see anyone else describe this numbness, this inability to react, this sense of being hollow and devoid of any sort of memories, emotions and connection to the world. God I miss my old life, my old self. Even something as basic as going to get my morning coffee brought so much joy and peace.

Sweat beads lined the edge of my forehead as I struggled to keep my eyes fixated on the newspaper that shielded my eyes from the woman sitting across from me.
 
“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg. 

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged 

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the *real* her. Because the person sitting before me today was *not* my wife. 

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below. 

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she *has* to know, right? 

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,” 

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view. 

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms. 

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear. 

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

Which means I’ve been down in the dumps, low energy, & I had been on a steroid for the sickness for 5 days & now on a z pack of antibiotics ( on my 2nd day of them). 
I took my adderall for the first time today because I really needed to clean my house and just get all the things done I haven’t been able to do in the last couple weeks. I’m on immediate release 1 pill 20 mg twice a day.

So today I took both, and now I feel soooo shitty. I got so light headed so quick, definitely felt like I was going to pass out, shit myself, and throw up. Nothing happened except for me getting extremely shakey and my legs and my arms going numb and tingly. I feel clammy and hot and cold, sweating and then have the goose bumps. Everytime I try to sit up or walk around I feel extremely weak and lethargic. I thought maybe because I only had a small breakfast, a coffee, and a couple sips of an energy drink that, barely  any water that that was the problem. I tried eating something both salty and sweet and can’t seem to even work up the will to eat. I’ve drank a lot of water, now just trying to breathe and sit for a bit. Was it a combination of all of that? Did I give myself too much caffeine and spark too much adrenaline? & this is a bad adrenaline crash? Did I give myself serotonin syndrome by not having my adderall in forever and taking both of them right off the bat? Is it my antibiotics clashing with them?

“It’s like you don’t love me anymore, darling. Did I do something wrong?’

Her leg shot up underneath the table, and her foot grazed my shin and right knee. I heard the water droplets drip down onto the floor as she rubbed her foot up and down against my leg. 

“Pleaaseee, darling. Won’t you look at me?’ she begged 

I sipped my coffee shakily and adjusted the newspaper in my hand. My heart thumped to the beat of a machine gun while my wife’s chipped and dirty nails clicked and clacked atop our dining room table. You see, it’s not that I didn’t want to see her; I loved my wife with all of my heart and soul. She was my rock, my support beam, and I’d give anything to have her back. Well, the *real* her. Because the person sitting before me today was *not* my wife. 

My wife was an angel. An illuminating light in my world of darkness. What happened to her was tragic and completely unjust, but it was also my fault. I was the reason behind her accident, the reason why she put on her stunning wedding gown one last time before throwing herself off the highest bridge in our city, and plummeting to her death in the watery grave below. 

We argued, and I said some things I didn’t mean; dear God, I want to take them back, but I can’t. I’m stuck, I’m imprisoned here with this, this, imposter. This sacrilegious thing that has taken the place of my wife. I was drunk and I told her I didn’t think she was attractive, and I’m sorry, okay?! I’m sorry for what I’ve done. She knows I thought she was beautiful, I know she knows it, she *has* to know, right? 

“Donavinnnnn..you’re still not looking at meee,” 

I was at my breaking point, and tears began to sting my eyes. Her cold, grey hand reached over and caressed the edge of my newspaper, leaving dark, wet streaks running down the length of it. She ran her hand across the top back and forth, and eventually the paper grew soggy and damp in my hands. The corners began to fold in, and my wife’s decaying face started forcing its way into view. 

With one flick of her broken wrist, she pushed the paper, and the whole thing slumped over in my arms. 

Maggots ate away at her face, and gaping black wounds etched the sides of her neck. Her eye sockets were completely black and hollow, but the worst part of all was her mouth. Her jaw was dislocated, yet her words came out so fluently, filling the room with the stench of rotting meat each time she spoke.

“Aren’t I pretty, Donavin? Don’t you love me?”

Her pouts grew into sobs, which eventually mutated into distorted wails. Ear-splitting screams that only I could hear. 

She’s still wearing her beautiful wedding dress, the silky white now coated with mucus and mud.

I love my wife. I miss my wife. Lord, forgive me for what I’ve done to my wife.

1n20nsk,https://i.redd.it/y4d98h21aolf1.jpeg,Looking for someone special in Greeley,"Hey there — I’m 24, originally from southern Louisiana but I’ve called Greeley home since 2019. Life has been a journey for me: I’m a proud dad to two amazing little ones (1 and 2) from my previous marriage, a combat veteran (Army, deployed to Syria in 2021), and now I work hard between two jobs — nights in sanitation at JBS and another during the day. Keeps me busy, but I wouldn’t trade the drive I have.

I follow Reform Judaism, lean conservative politically, and at heart I’m very much a classic southern gentleman. I believe in being kind, respectful, romantic, and making the people around me smile. My friends and family would tell you I’m the kindest person they know — goofy when the mood is right, but also ambitious and serious about my goals.

Sports and fitness are a big part of my life — I love basketball (NBA and college), college football (Geaux Tigers), and I’ve been on a serious fitness journey this year. Since January, I’ve dropped from 253 lbs down to 183. Running has become a passion, and I’m training for marathons now, with ultrarunning in sight for next year.

So what am I looking for? A real connection here in Greeley. Someone who enjoys laughter, good conversation, and maybe doesn’t mind a little southern charm now and then. A first date could be as simple as coffee or a walk in the park — I think the best connections start simple and grow naturally.

If you’re looking for someone genuine, kind, and maybe just a little old-fashioned in the best ways, I’d love to hear from you. Who knows — maybe I’ll make you laugh, and maybe you’ll be the reason I smile a little bigger every day.

1n20nor,https://www.reddit.com/r/NCL/comments/1n20nor/ncl_aqua_5_day_bermuda_trip/,NCL Aqua - 5 day Bermuda Trip,"Reviews on recent NCL Aqua trip: 

1. Cabins - we had an interior room mid-ship Deck 11 (directly below the medical center). It was very quiet. Lots of storage space - 3 separate closet spaces + large drawers under TV area, shelves next to mirror/vanity area, and bathroom storage. The cabin felt roomy. We did not ask them to separate the beds and felt like we had plenty of space with the larger bed. Shower felt HUGE and also had shelves for toiletries, foot rest for shaving legs. 
-One thing I’ve seen mentioned before and we did notice by the end of the trip - unfortunately, we could smell sewage starting the last 2 days of the trip. This did not become unbearable but I would be nervous if it was a longer cruise and we had to continue dealing with this smell. 

2. Food and service - mediocre. All of the staff we encountered were working hard and they seemed to have plenty of people but lots of things were moving SLOW. 
We got to Main Dining Room around 8pm. It closes at 9pm. It took quite a while for our order to be taken and then we waited long periods between courses. We did not get served our main course til after 9pm and almost skipped dessert entirely. They were still seating people at 9pm. Sister had steak medium-rare and it was impossible to cut with steak knife. 

The Local - we tried the bar area a couple times which serves snack food. The bartenders were working hard especially on embarkation day and they made excellent drinks. On day 2ish, we sat at a table next to the bar and ordered two snacks - loaded nachos and spinach and artichoke dip. We waited for more than an hour and our food never came, waitress disappeared. We finally gave up. We did try this again on day 4 and our drinks and snacks were delivered promptly (although it was less busy at the time). Spinach dip tasted like the kind you get frozen and just heat up. We also tried breakfast at The Local one morning around 10. This was a poor choice on our part because we were docked in Bermuda and the ship was doing a crew drill training session starting at 9:30. Probably 90% of the workers were involved with the drill so service was slow and chaotic. They also wouldn’t allow us to re-enter from the ocean walk area since they were closing fire doors, and shut down the elevators a few times during this time. 

Onda by Scarpetta - Italian. Nothing to write home about. We had 5:30 reservations and they wouldn’t let us near the doors until 5:35. We were seated outside. Burrata appetizer was good. Only one other table outside was seated so our waiter was attentive but again, slow service. 

SukoThai - we had 5:30 reservations (when they open) and were able to get a great table with a view by the window. The restaurant area feels small and if you are seated in the larger back portion, you don’t have a view at all. Spring rolls were tasty. We weren’t a fan of the chicken satay. The salt and pepper prawns were just tempura shrimp so if you like fried shrimp, then it’s good lol Dessert was delicious - fried bananas with ice cream. 

Indulge Food Hall - we did not have great food here either. The tablets you use to order were glitchy and as others have noted, although there are many tables outside, there are no tablets there. The space inside was crowded and it felt like they shoved a chair into every inch of space so you couldn’t easily get in/out of your table. Lots of bar seating but at those tablets you can only order the food served in that section. Everything you order comes out individually at random times. Things did seem to move quicker here.   As far as we could tell, the options you could order here didn’t change much even from lunch to dinner. They also close Indulge from around 2:30-5 everyday. We were unable to order desserts on the tablets - there was a prompt to go to the dessert section to look at what the options were. There is an outdoor bar at the back of Indulge which never seemed busy when we passed. And also an outdoor self-serve soft serve ice cream machine. 

The Buffet (Surfside Cafe) - complete and utter chaos. The walkways were far too narrow and unlike on previous ships, there is only one small section for each food offering. The staff that were helping to move things were actually just standing in the way and yelling at people to go sit in the specialty restaurant section. But most people standing on the walkway were actually just trying to get food, not find a seat. A lot of the flavor combos and food served seemed random like they were just using leftovers. There were a couple times in the afternoons where only the “Grill” section in the back was open, serving various hamburgers, hot dogs, fries, and condiments. This wasn’t always open through dinner though. There is a water bottle filling section and plenty of ice water, juice, and coffee stations throughout the buffet. 
Observation Lounge - this is on the opposite side of deck 17 and is all indoors with a great view of the ocean. There is a bar (only open during certain hours) and an area that has “light breakfast” I think from 10-12:30ish? and snacks from 2:30-4:30ish. On the days I went the breakfast included coffee, juice, mini pastries (croissants, muffins, danishes), cereals, yogurt, and egg bites. The afternoon snacks included a couple varieties of quiche, scones, and cookies. 

Bars - open different hours for each but all seems good. The Improv Bar doesn’t have an espresso machine so can’t do espresso martinis. Most of the bars could do frozen drinks. Even when crowded we never had to wait more than a few minutes for drinks.

I’m planning a 2-week stay in NYC this September as a trial run to see what living there might feel like. I’m thinking of splitting my time between East Village, Williamsburg, and Astoria to get a mix of Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Queens.

A few things I’m hoping to do:
- Catch both a Yankees and a Mets game
- Hit a few touristy spots (museums, maybe a Broadway show, landmarks)
- Explore the neighborhoods more organically — walking around, checking out local restaurants, bars, etc.
- Work remotely from cafes and coffee shops to get a sense of the day-to-day vibe

Questions:
1. What’s a realistic budget for 2 weeks all-in (housing, meals, transport, entertainment)?
2. Any recommendations for must-visit spots in those neighborhoods specifically?
3. Any “things to know” that someone considering a move should keep in mind during a short stay like this?

I’m in mid/late 20s, and want to balance doing some classic NYC stuff with just getting a feel for what everyday life would be like if I moved here.

Appreciate any advice!

1n20l7o,https://www.reddit.com/r/dating_advice/comments/1n20l7o/why_dont_i_have_any_success/,Why don’t I have any success?,"I’m a 21 year old male and I’ve been really down on myself lately and really don’t know what to do. I’ve tried dating people from apps, school, work, mutual interest groups(?), basically all the suggestions I’ve ever gotten but nothing ever works out. I’ve been on two first dates and one second date. Never had a girlfriend, and since I’m graduating college soon I feel like I’m going to be losing out on a really great place to meet people (not that I’ve had any success doing it). 

Most of the time I’ve tried asking girls out they either ignore me, come up with an excuse and don’t try to figure out another time, or otherwise try to let me down easy. The couple dates I’ve been on have felt great in the moment, especially the most recent two. 

I met a girl on a dating app and we went to a museum and got coffee together. I brought her a little flower which she seemed to really appreciate. We’re both students and we live in different cities, and she drove a decent amount to see me since I didn’t have a car, which I felt bad about but secretly felt like it was a good sign. A couple weeks later, we planned a second date. We called and texted every day in between and things seemed to be going really well. She drove even farther this time even though I had a car at this point and the date was everything I could’ve hoped for. I planned a picnic in a park and we got food, then walked to get ice cream. We spent hours together. I made her a bouquet with flowers she had mentioned liking, and the more we talked the more I felt like it was going to be perfect. We agreed on almost everything and had a conversation about what we want out of a relationship, which we aligned on almost to a T. But the next morning she texted me and said that she didn’t think it was going to work out because we “wanted different things.” I asked for clarification and all she said was that I didn’t do anything wrong but didn’t elaborate further. This obviously crushed me but at this point it’s kind of what I’ve come to expect. 

I guess to wrap it all up, how do I start feeling better about myself and actually find someone who likes me for who I am? I feel like I’ve tried everything and I’m just so discouraged.

Adrian leaned back in his chair while his amber eyes remained 

fixed on Noelle as she absentmindedly drizzled syrup over her 

pancake. 

“Stop staring and eat,” Noelle said with a laugh as she caught his 

gaze. 

Adrian smirked and rested his chin on his hand. “Can’t help it. 

You’re prettier than breakfast.” Noelle rolled her eyes, but a 

faint blush dusted her cheeks. “Flattery will not get you another 

pancake.” 

Before Adrian could respond, his phone vibrated on the table 

and the screen lit up with Miles‘ name. Adrian let out a groan 

while his smile faded as he picked up the phone. 

“Do you have to ruin my morning already, Miles?” Adrian 

grumbled, holding the phone to his ear. 

“Good morning to you too, sunshine,” Miles replied, his voice 

brisk. “I need you at AMN, now.” 

Adrian’s brows furrowed. “I just got home last night. Can’t it 

wait? I’m having breakfast with Noelle.” 

Chapter 1 

“It can’t wait,” Miles said firmly. “We just got an offer from Dela 

Vega Productions. It’s huge, Adrian! The kind of deal people 

would kill for. You need to hear this in person.” 

Adrian pinched the bridge of his nose. He glanced at Noelle who 

was quietly sipping her coffee but watching him with an 

understanding smile. 

“I’m not interested, Miles,” Adrian said while leaning back in his 

chair. “I told you **I** want to spend time with Noelle. Whatever it 

is, we can talk about it tomorrow.” 

“No, we can’t,” Miles insisted with an unyielding tone in his 

voice. “This is a once–in–a–lifetime opportunity. Dela Vega 

Productions doesn’t just knock on doors! They only call when 

they know you’re the best fit. You’d be crazy to ignore this.” 

Adrian sighed heavily and ran a hand through his messy hair. 

He looked at Noelle again, silently apologizing with his eyes. But 

Noelle only smiled softly while nodding her head in silent 

encouragement. 

“Fine,” Adrian finally said but still a little reluctant. “I’ll be there 

in an hour.” 

“Make it half,” Miles quipped before hanging up. 

Adrian set his phone down with a groan, rubbing his face with 

Chapter 1 

both hands. “That man doesn’t understand the concept of 

personal time.” 

Noelle chuckled, reaching across the table to squeeze his hand. 

“It’s okay. I know how important your work is. Go on and 

prepare.” 

Adrian sighed, standing up and walked around the table to 

plant a kiss on the top of her head.” 

At least let me drive you to the bridal shop you mentioned to me 

last night,” Adrian said, his voice soft as he stroked her hair. 

“You said you wanted to pick out your dress.” 

Noelle’s lips curled into a smile as she looked up at him. “You 

don’t have to. You’re already in a rush because of Miles, and I 

know how much he’ll nag you if you’re late.“” 

Adrian smirked, crouching down beside her chair so their eyes 

met. “I can handle Miles. But you? You’re my priority” 

Her heart softened at his words, but she still shook her head 

gently. “I’ll be fine. Grace is meeting me there, remember? You 

focus on this big project. We’ll have plenty of time later to argue 

over lace and tulle.” 

Adrian’s amber eyes narrowed in playful protest. “You’re really 

going to pick a dress without me? That’s cruel, darling.” 

Chapter 1 

She chuckled, brushing her fingers along his cheek. “You’re not supposed to see the dress before the wedding anyway, Mr. 

Blackwood. Isn’t that bad luck?” 

“Superstition,” Adrian countered with a grin, but he sighed in surrender. “Fine. But I’m holding you to a full recap when I get 

back.” 

“Deal,” she said with a laugh, leaning in to press a soft kiss to his lips. “Now go before Miles calls again and yells at you.” 

Reluctantly, Adrian stood, grabbing his jacket and keys. He 

turned back to her as he reached the door. “Text me as soon as 

you’re done, okay? And don’t let Grace pressure you into 

picking something you don’t like.” 

Noelle shook her head, amused by his concern. “I promise. Go on 

now.”” 

With one last lingering glance, Adrian left as the sound of the 

door clicking shut echoed through the house. Noelle exhaled deeply while her fingers brushed against her lips where his kiss. 

lingered, before finishing her coffee. 

Grace stood outside of the bridal shop while keeping her eyes on 

her watch. The soft clinking of her bracelets echoed faintly as 

Chapter 1 

she crossed her arms and tapped her heel against the pavement. 

And when she spotted Noelle approaching in her usual shirt 

and fitted pants, Grace couldn’t help but let out a light laughter. 

“You know, you’re probably the only bride–to–be in the city who 

shows up to pick a wedding dress looking like she’s here to run 

errands.” 

Noelle shrugged with a shy smile as she reached Grace. “What’s 

wrong with being comfortable? I didn’t know I needed to dress 

up to try on dresses.”” 

Grace shook her head, still smiling as she linked her arm with 

Noelle’s. “There’s nothing wrong with it, Elle. I just… admire how 

grounded you are. Most women would be showing off if they 

were in your shoes.” She gestured down to Noelle’s modest 

sneakers. “I heard Adrian spoilt you with everything.”” 

Noelle rolled her eyes as her smile softened. “Don’t remind me. 

I’ve told him a hundred times to stop buying me things I don’t 

need. Half the time, I feel like I have to scold him like a child.” 

Grace let out a laugh. “Oh, I can picture that. But you know him, 

he’s not just an actor. He’s practically a one–man empire. I swear, 

Adrian thinks spoiling **you** is his personal mission.” 

Noelle’s steps faltered slightly and glanced at Grace. “Empire? 

What are you talking about?” 

Chapter 1 

Grace froze for a split second as she realized her slip. But she 

quickly plastered on a nonchalant expression. “I just mean… you know, he’s a big deal. His projects, his influence… it’s a lot to 

handle.” 

Noelle frowned, clearly unconvinced but unwilling to press 

further. “Well, I still wish he’d tone it down. I don’t need all of 

that to be happy. Just him.” 

Grace’s smile softened at her friend’s words. Noelle’s humility 

and sincerity were exactly why she and Adrian adored her so 

much. Looping their arms together again, Grace tugged her 

toward the bridal shop. “Come on, let’s find you the dress of 

your dreams before you talk yourself out of it.” 

But the moment they entered, Noelle ended up gasping in utter 

surprise. She then laughed nervously as her eyes darted around 

the bridal shop. The gleaming chandeliers, racks of delicate lace, 

and mannequins adorned in the finest silk gowns exuded 

luxury at every corner. Her gaze landed on a dress with 

intricate beading, and her jaw dropped when she spotted the 

price tag. 

“Wow… these are beautiful… and expensive!” she exclaimed, her 

tone rising in mild panic. “Why would you bring me here?!” 

Grace burst out laughing, shaking her head as she grabbed 

Chapter 1

you’ve never stepped into a fancy shop before.”

what makes you so special, Elle. You don’t care about my

Building a circle that elevates your journey

Why Your Inner Circle Matters More Than You Think 🎯
Have you ever noticed how some people seem to effortlessly navigate life's challenges while radiating positivity? The secret isn't luck—it's the company they keep. The individuals you choose to surround yourself with don't just influence your mood for the day; they shape your entire trajectory in life.

Think about it: when you spend time with someone who complains constantly, you find yourself focusing on problems. Conversely, when you're around someone who sees opportunities everywhere, you start noticing them too. This isn't coincidence—it's psychology in action.

Your social environment acts like an invisible force field, either propelling you forward or holding you back. The conversations you have, the attitudes you absorb, and the energy you exchange all contribute to who you become. This is why being intentional about your relationships isn't selfish—it's essential.

The Five Game-Changing Personality Types 🚀
1. The Visionaries: People Who See What Others Miss 👁️
These are the individuals who look at a blank wall and see a mural. They're the ones who watch a sunset and feel compelled to write poetry, or who see a problem and immediately start brainstorming solutions. Visionaries don't just dream—they make others believe that dreams are achievable.

What makes them special:

They ask ""what if"" instead of ""why not""
They see potential where others see obstacles
They encourage creative thinking and innovation
They help you expand your perspective beyond current limitations
How they'll change your life:
When you're around visionaries, your own imagination gets activated. You start thinking bigger about your goals, your career, your relationships, and your impact on the world. They don't just support your dreams—they help you discover dreams you didn't know you had.

Real-world application:
Seek out that coworker who always has fresh ideas for improving processes. Befriend the neighbor who turned their backyard into an urban garden. Connect with the person at your gym who's training for their first marathon at age 50. These people will stretch your definition of what's possible.

2. The Fire-Starters: Those Who Live With Burning Enthusiasm 🔥
Passionate people are magnetic. They talk about their interests with such genuine excitement that you can't help but get caught up in their energy. Whether they're passionate about cooking, technology, social causes, or their family, they bring an intensity to life that's contagious.

What makes them irresistible:

They fully commit to what matters to them
They speak with conviction and authenticity
They're willing to take risks for what they believe in
They demonstrate that caring deeply is strength, not vulnerability
The transformation they bring:
Passionate people remind you that life is meant to be lived fully, not just endured. They show you that it's okay to care deeply about things, to get excited, to invest emotionally in your pursuits. They help you identify what truly matters to you and give you permission to pursue it wholeheartedly.

Daily implementation:
Notice who lights up when they talk about their work, hobbies, or values. These are your people. Join communities centered around activities you enjoy. Attend local meetups, workshops, or classes. Passionate people naturally gravitate toward spaces where they can share their enthusiasm.

3. The Momentum Builders: Self-Directed and Unstoppable 💪
These individuals don't wait for perfect conditions or external validation to take action. They set goals and systematically work toward them. They face setbacks but don't let them derail their progress. They're the embodiment of the principle that consistent small actions create extraordinary results.

Their defining characteristics:

They take ownership of their circumstances
They focus on solutions rather than problems
They maintain consistent habits that support their goals
They view failures as learning opportunities, not stopping points
The ripple effect they create:
Being around self-directed people naturally raises your standards for yourself. You start questioning why you're waiting for permission, perfect timing, or ideal circumstances. You begin to see that progress is possible right now, with whatever resources you currently have.

Practical steps to find them:
Look for people who are actively working on personal projects, learning new skills, or making positive changes in their lives. They might be the person who wakes up early to exercise, the colleague who's taking evening classes, or the friend who started a side business. These people prove that transformation is always possible.

4. The Appreciation Ambassadors: Masters of Gratitude 🙏
In a world that often focuses on what's missing, wrong, or insufficient, people who naturally notice and appreciate the good stand out like beacons. They're not naive optimists who ignore problems—they simply choose to acknowledge beauty, kindness, and progress wherever they find it.

What sets them apart:

They notice and acknowledge positive moments and gestures
They express genuine appreciation for people and experiences
They find value in simple pleasures and everyday miracles
They help others see their own worth and contributions
The shift they create:
Grateful people literally rewire your brain for positivity. When you spend time with them, you start noticing things you previously overlooked: the way morning light hits your coffee cup, a stranger's smile, the satisfaction of completing a task, the comfort of a friend's laugh. Life becomes richer and more meaningful.

How to connect with them:
These individuals often volunteer at local organizations, write thank-you notes, celebrate others' achievements, or maintain practices like journaling or meditation. They're the people who remember your birthday, compliment your efforts, and make you feel valued. Seek them out in community service groups, spiritual communities (regardless of specific beliefs), or anywhere people gather to celebrate life.

5. The Growth Enthusiasts: Forever Students of Life 📚
Open-minded people are intellectual adventurers. They're curious about different perspectives, willing to change their minds when presented with new information, and excited by the prospect of learning something that challenges their current understanding. They see every interaction as an opportunity to expand their worldview.

Their remarkable qualities:

They ask thoughtful questions and listen genuinely to answers
They admit when they don't know something or when they're wrong
They're interested in cultures, ideas, and experiences different from their own
They encourage exploration and experimentation
The expansion they facilitate:
Open-minded people create safe spaces for growth and self-discovery. Around them, you feel free to explore new ideas, admit uncertainties, and evolve your thinking. They help you realize that changing your mind isn't weakness—it's intelligence in action.

Where to encounter them:
Look for people who read diverse books, travel when possible, engage in thoughtful conversations about complex topics, or show genuine interest in learning about others' experiences. They're often found in book clubs, cultural events, community discussions, online forums focused on learning, and anywhere ideas are exchanged.

The Magnetic Effect: How These People Find Each Other 🧲
Here's something fascinating: people with these positive qualities tend to attract each other. Visionaries appreciate passionate people's commitment. Passionate people admire the consistency of self-directed individuals. Self-directed people value the perspective of grateful people. Grateful people are drawn to the curiosity of open-minded individuals. And open-minded people are inspired by visionaries' creativity.

This creates a beautiful ecosystem where positive qualities amplify each other. When you embody these characteristics yourself, you naturally attract others who share them.

Practical Strategies for Building Your Ideal Circle 🎯
Start with Self-Reflection
Before seeking these people, honestly assess your current relationships. Who in your life already embodies these qualities? How can you spend more time with them? Which relationships consistently drain your energy or reinforce negative patterns?

Be Intentional About New Connections
Instead of leaving relationships to chance, actively seek environments where positive people congregate. This might include professional development workshops, hobby groups, volunteer organizations, fitness classes, book clubs, or creative communities.

Quality Over Quantity
It's better to have three deep, positive relationships than thirty superficial ones. Focus on building meaningful connections with people who genuinely embody these qualities rather than trying to network with everyone.

Become What You Seek
The most effective way to attract positive people is to develop these qualities yourself. Start expressing more gratitude, pursue your passions more actively, stay curious about new ideas, work consistently toward your goals, and dare to envision bigger possibilities.

Practice Patience
Building a supportive circle takes time. Don't abandon current relationships abruptly or expect instant transformation. Instead, gradually increase time with positive influences while maintaining appropriate boundaries with energy-draining relationships.

The Science Behind Social Influence 🧠
Research consistently shows that we unconsciously mirror the emotions, behaviors, and attitudes of people we spend time with. This phenomenon, called emotional contagion, means that surrounding yourself with positive people literally changes your brain chemistry and behavioral patterns.

Studies have found that happiness spreads through social networks up to three degrees of separation. If your friend's friend's friend is happy, it increases your likelihood of happiness. Conversely, negative emotions and limiting beliefs spread in the same way.

This isn't mystical thinking—it's neuroscience. Your brain forms neural pathways based on repeated thoughts and experiences. When you consistently encounter positive attitudes and behaviors, these become your mental defaults.

Overcoming Common Obstacles 🚧
""I Don't Have Time for New Relationships""
Start small. Engage more meaningfully with positive people already in your life. Join one group or activity that aligns with your interests. Quality connections can develop from just a few hours per month of shared activity.

""I'm Too Introverted""
You don't need to become a social butterfly. Look for smaller groups or one-on-one opportunities. Online communities can be perfect starting points for introverts. Focus on depth rather than breadth.

""I Live in a Small Community""
Use technology to your advantage. Online courses, forums, and virtual communities can connect you with like-minded people globally. Consider starting a local group around your interests—you might be surprised who emerges from the woodwork.

""I'm Afraid of Rejection""
Remember that authentic, positive people are generally welcoming to others who share their values and interests. Focus on shared activities rather than trying to force friendships. Let relationships develop naturally through common experiences.

Creating Ripple Effects: Becoming a Positive Influence 🌊
As you surround yourself with these five types of people, you'll naturally begin embodying their qualities. You'll become more visionary, passionate, self-directed, grateful, and open-minded. This transformation will make you a positive influence in others' lives, creating ripple effects that extend far beyond your immediate circle.

Consider how your personal growth impacts your family, coworkers, community, and even strangers you encounter. By intentionally cultivating positive relationships, you're not just improving your own life—you're contributing to a more positive world.

Long-term Vision: Building Legacy Relationships 🏗️
Think beyond immediate benefits. The relationships you build today will shape not just your present, but your future opportunities, personal development, and life satisfaction. These connections often become the foundation for business partnerships, creative collaborations, lifelong friendships, and meaningful contributions to your community.

Some of the most successful and fulfilled people attribute their achievements not to individual effort, but to the network of positive relationships they've cultivated over time. They understand that success is rarely a solo journey.

Your Action Plan: Starting Today 📅
Week 1-2: Identify and spend more time with positive people already in your life.

Week 3-4: Research and join one group or activity aligned with your interests.

Month 2: Initiate deeper conversations with new acquaintances who demonstrate positive qualities.

Month 3: Evaluate your progress and adjust your approach based on what you've learned.

Ongoing: Continuously develop these five qualities within yourself while remaining open to new positive connections.

The Compound Effect of Positive Relationships 📈
Like compound interest in finance, the benefits of positive relationships grow exponentially over time. Each inspiring conversation, each moment of shared passion, each example of perseverance, each expression of gratitude, and each exchange of ideas builds upon previous experiences.

Years from now, you'll look back and realize that the decision to intentionally surround yourself with positive people was one of the most important choices you ever made. Not just for what you achieved, but for who you became in the process.

Your life is too short and too precious to spend it surrounded by people who diminish your light. You deserve relationships that inspire, encourage, challenge, appreciate, and expand you. The five types of people described here aren't just nice to have around—they're essential for creating a life of meaning, growth, and fulfillment.

Start today. Your future self will thank you for the courage to choose your circle intentionally, and the world will benefit from the positive person you become through these transformative relationships.

I know how much she and Rory love coffee is a thing throughout the show, but as a non coffee drinker it always makes me think if this is normal for coffee lovers or extremely exaggerated for the show. 5 cups of coffees plus the extra cup at Luke’s whilst it’s still morning seems like a lot but maybe it’s not?

Got any tips?,"Howdy Y'all. I definitely could use some advice. This is definitely a long post, so bring a cup of coffee. I graduated college with a bachelor’s in CS back in December 2021, followed by 5 months of job applications and rejection letters. As months went by, the feeling of imposter syndrome was hovering over me, especially after several failed coding tests after I did get a response from one of every 20 jobs I applied to. It was then I decided on an unconventional route and tried to do a startup with my mother in an art-business direction.

I did that for around 2 years, working on WordPress and WooCommerce websites, market research and other things like video and photo editing. We amassed an audience of over 20k subscribers and got a positive response on a digital eBook where we got over $1k in sales in a month out of the blue. People loved her, and I was ecstatic about this market response! That is when we decided to start planning for online courses about the topic and start teaching people about how to do the artwork she makes vs selling her artwork. The keyword in that sentence though was started planning. We never got a chance to follow through as the worst-case scenario happened. After a bad trip to the ER one night, she was diagnosed with a rare, high-grade stage-4 cancer with little warning signs to its presence.

Because I was starting a business with my mother, we decided to stop and shut down the business almost over night, and I would dedicate the next year of my life as her 24/7 personal caregiver. I did everything from running chemotherapy appointments, adapting to her dietary restrictions, and eventually bed-side assistance. Every step of the way I was by her side. This was by far the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. It is almost blurry looking back during this time, and it hasn’t even been that long ago. I am honored that I was able to do everything I did for her, she was a mom that everyone deserved, but not everyone had. (Rest in Peace)

It has been about a year since she has passed away, during that time I have been taking care of things that she left behind. It was quite heart wrenching to both loose my mother, and a startup I poured my heart and soul into in one fell swoop. Afterwards I spent a year cleaning up and selling her home and taking care of probate and other fun legal stuff.

During that time (when she was still alive) I decided on starting an astrophotography hobby and I am still enamored with it to this day. I even went as far as starting my own small website and want to explore it further and start selling prints online. I have always been a space-nerd at heart, but this hobby has taught me that this would be something I would love to be apart of. Realistically this will not pay the bills though, maybe eventually and I will keep trying in the background, but I need to set my priorities straight.

And now we come back around, thank you for listening to my tale. So here I am, I haven’t worked a proper job yet at 26 years old, but I feel like I have been determined the whole time to get into something. I enjoyed web development, working on marketing and business startups, but I would love to get into something space oriented while keeping to my core CS grad knowledge (if a bit rusty). What would you do in my situation? What career tips would you recommend to get into web development? Or would you pivot to a different route that you see would fit my direction?

Without realising me and S were walking ahead and the other two girls were walking behind us. The other two girls decided to take the bus midway. Me and S decided to walk for another 40 min back to the apartments. We opened up and told our stories-our childhood, about our families, about our education, life and how we ended up here. 
I'm an extrovert and I kinda have a lose mouth and S figured that out. I don't know what she saw in me but she decided to tell me her deep secret (which even her roommates don't know). I don't know why she trusted me. I've told her I will keep it a secret and guard it with life.

She even asked me to find a place in the town for a cup of coffee🥹🥹
We really had a good talk and after reaching our apartments, we decided to take a break, have a snack and meet after 15 minutes.
I texted her after 15 minutes but S told me she's tired so we called the plan off.

I was right behind her but she ignored me and went with her friends. (- Aura😭)

I am in phase of moving out of psychology of spending on eating out and earning reward points to cover my flights in future. I am ashamed that I have fallen for consumerism.

I’ve been through a lot, like many of us heartbreak, reinvention, and long nights staring at the ceiling asking what the point of it all is. But I’ve also found meaning in helping others, healing old wounds, and building things that matter  whether that’s a business, a friendship, or a life with integrity.

I’m in Brisbane, and I’d love to eventually meet up  grab a coffee, share a story, go for a walk and talk about how weird and beautiful the world is. But I’m also open to deep friendships online. Maybe you’re also trying to find your people. Maybe you’ve been holding a lot inside too.

*Why successful people always zoom out before diving in*

## The Hidden Pattern Behind Every Success Story 📈

Ever wondered why some people seem to effortlessly solve complex problems while others get stuck spinning their wheels? The secret isn't superior intelligence or luck—it's perspective.

When faced with any challenge, whether it's a stubborn relationship conflict, a career roadblock, or even something as mundane as chronic lateness, most people dive straight into fixing symptoms. But there's a more powerful approach that changes everything: **connecting every problem to its larger system**.

This isn't about mystical thinking or philosophical theories. It's about developing a practical skill that will serve you whether you're troubleshooting a technical issue, improving your health, or building better relationships.

## Why Your Current Problem-Solving Approach Might Be Sabotaging You 🚫

Picture this: Your car keeps breaking down. The obvious response? Take it to the mechanic, fix the immediate issue, and drive away. But three weeks later, you're back with another problem. Then another.

Most people get trapped in this reactive cycle because they're focused on isolated incidents rather than patterns. They're treating symptoms instead of understanding the system that creates those symptoms.

The same principle applies to every area of life:

**Career frustrations** often stem from misaligned values or industry trends, not just difficult bosses.

**Relationship conflicts** usually reflect communication patterns and unmet needs, not isolated arguments.

**Financial stress** typically emerges from spending habits and income structures, not individual purchases.

**Health problems** frequently connect to lifestyle systems, not random bad luck.

When you train yourself to see these connections, you stop playing whack-a-mole with problems and start addressing root causes.

## The Systems Thinking Toolkit: Your Daily Game-Changer 🛠️

### 1. The Ripple Effect Analysis

Every problem exists within a web of interconnected factors. Before jumping to solutions, map out the ripples.

**Practical Exercise:** When facing any challenge, ask yourself:
- What factors contribute to this situation?
- Who else is affected by this problem?
- What other areas of my life does this connect to?
- If I solve this in isolation, what might I miss?

**Real-World Example:** If you're always stressed about deadlines, don't just work longer hours. Examine your planning systems, communication patterns with colleagues, energy management throughout the day, and even your workspace setup. Often, the solution lies in optimizing one of these connected areas rather than just working harder.

### 2. The Three-Level Perspective Framework

Train yourself to view every situation through three lenses:

**Micro Level:** The immediate problem and its direct factors
**Macro Level:** The broader environment and trends influencing the situation  
**Meta Level:** The underlying patterns and principles at work

**Daily Application:** When your teenager won't do homework, don't just focus on that specific resistance (micro). Consider their school environment, peer influences, and current educational pressures (macro), plus their relationship with authority, learning style, and developmental stage (meta).

### 3. The Ecosystem Mapping Method 🗺️

Every problem exists within an ecosystem of relationships, resources, constraints, and opportunities.

**How to Apply This:**
- List all the people involved or affected
- Identify available resources and existing limitations
- Note timing factors and external pressures
- Map out potential allies and obstacles

**Example in Action:** If you're struggling with work-life balance, your ecosystem includes your family members, colleagues, industry expectations, personal energy patterns, commute logistics, childcare arrangements, and even your neighborhood's community resources. Solutions often emerge from optimizing these interconnected elements rather than just managing your calendar better.

## Breaking Free from Tunnel Vision: The Power of Pattern Recognition 🔍

### Spotting the Invisible Connections

Most people miss the connections between their problems because they're looking for obvious, direct links. But the most powerful insights often come from unexpected relationships.

**Pattern Recognition Exercise:**
Keep a simple daily log for one week. Note challenges, frustrations, and setbacks. After seven days, look for patterns:
- Do problems cluster around certain times, people, or situations?
- Which challenges share common underlying factors?
- Where do you see repeated themes or triggers?

### The Context Revolution

Context shapes everything, yet most people ignore it when problem-solving. The same approach that works brilliantly in one context might fail miserably in another.

**Context Questions to Ask:**
- What's unique about the current environment or timing?
- How do cultural, social, or organizational factors influence this situation?
- What worked in similar situations, and why might those solutions not apply here?

## The Compound Effect of Systems Solutions ⚡

When you address problems at the systems level, your solutions tend to:

**Prevent Related Issues:** Fix one well-connected problem, and you often prevent several others.

**Create Positive Cascades:** Systems-level improvements generate beneficial ripple effects across multiple areas.

**Build Long-term Resilience:** Instead of constant firefighting, you develop robust systems that handle future challenges better.

**Save Time and Energy:** You solve multiple problems with single, well-designed interventions.

## Practical Implementation: Your 30-Day Systems Thinking Challenge 📅

### Week 1: Awareness Building
Start noticing connections everywhere. When any problem arises, spend five minutes identifying at least three factors that contribute to or are affected by this issue.

### Week 2: Pattern Documentation
Keep a simple log of challenges and their broader contexts. Look for recurring themes, timing patterns, and environmental factors.

### Week 3: Ecosystem Mapping
For one significant ongoing challenge, create a comprehensive map of all connected factors, people, and potential solutions.

### Week 4: Systems Solutions
Instead of quick fixes, design solutions that address multiple connected factors simultaneously.

## Beyond Problem-Solving: Systems Thinking as Life Strategy 🎲

### Decision-Making Excellence

When facing any major decision, systems thinkers evaluate:
- How this choice affects multiple life areas
- What precedent this decision sets for future choices
- How this aligns with broader values and long-term goals
- What unintended consequences might emerge

### Relationship Mastery

Understanding relationships as systems transforms how you handle conflicts, build connections, and create mutual value. Every interaction exists within a broader context of shared history, external pressures, and future implications.

### Career Navigation

Career success isn't just about individual performance—it's about understanding industry ecosystems, organizational dynamics, market trends, and how your role connects to broader value creation.

## The Compound Benefits: Why This Matters for Your Future 🚀

Developing systems thinking doesn't just solve today's problems—it builds your capacity to handle increasingly complex challenges. As our world becomes more interconnected, this skill becomes more valuable.

**Professional Advantages:**
- Enhanced strategic thinking capabilities
- Better ability to manage complex projects
- Improved collaboration and communication skills
- Greater resilience when facing unexpected changes

**Personal Benefits:**
- More effective relationship management
- Better health and wellness outcomes
- Improved financial decision-making
- Reduced stress from constantly fighting symptoms

**Community Impact:**
- More thoughtful parenting approaches
- Better neighborhood and community involvement
- Enhanced ability to contribute to positive social change

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid ⚠️

### Analysis Paralysis
Systems thinking doesn't mean endless analysis. Set boundaries on exploration time and move to action within reasonable timeframes.

### Overwhelming Complexity
Start with simple connections and gradually build your ability to see more complex patterns. Don't try to map every possible connection immediately.

### Ignoring Individual Agency
While systems matter, individual choices and actions still drive outcomes. Balance systems awareness with personal responsibility.

## Making It Stick: Building Your Systems Thinking Muscle 💪

### Daily Micro-Practices
- When reading news, ask: ""What broader trends does this represent?""
- During conversations, notice how topics connect to larger themes
- When planning activities, consider their ripple effects on other life areas

### Weekly Reviews
Spend 15 minutes each week identifying patterns in your challenges and successes. Look for systems-level insights that could improve the coming week.

### Monthly Deep-Dives
Once monthly, choose one ongoing challenge and do a comprehensive systems analysis. Map connections, identify leverage points, and design multi-faceted solutions.

## The Long-Term Vision: Becoming a Systems Thinker 🌟

Systems thinking isn't just a problem-solving tool—it's a way of seeing the world that enhances every aspect of life. As you develop this capacity, you'll find yourself:

- Making better decisions with less stress
- Solving problems more efficiently and effectively
- Building stronger, more resilient relationships
- Creating positive changes that compound over time
- Developing wisdom that serves you in any situation

The journey from reactive problem-solving to systems thinking transforms not just how you handle challenges, but how you understand your role in the larger web of life. You become someone who doesn't just react to circumstances, but actively shapes better outcomes through thoughtful engagement with the systems around you.

Remember: every expert was once a beginner. Start small, stay consistent, and trust the process. Your future self will thank you for developing this transformative way of thinking.

People (mostly Gen Z and Millennials) record themselves making coffee, journaling, hitting the gym, showing what they eat, or going through their skincare steps. These videos rack up tons of views and comments, and the creators often do them consistently almost like a mini-series.

My take is that I think a lot of this is less about “sharing” or “inspiring” and more about seeking validation. Social media is built on feedback loops (likes, shares, comments), and these routine-style posts seem like a way to say, ""Look how productive, disciplined, or aesthetic my life is - do you admire it?”

To me, if your morning routine or daily flow is just for you, then you’d quietly live it out. Filming, editing, and posting it for strangers feels like it crosses into performance. I get that some people might genuinely want to motivate others or share tips, but I think the main driver for most of these posts is external approval.

That said, I could be wrong. Maybe there are other perspectives I’m missing:

* Do you think some people share routines as a form of accountability (like putting it out there keeps them consistent)?
* Could it be more about community and relatability than validation?
* Or maybe it really does help inspire others in a meaningful way, even if validation plays a role.

Life has a funny way of keeping us anchored to moments that have already sailed away. We replay conversations, second-guess decisions, and sometimes find ourselves stuck in a mental time machine that only travels backward. But here's the reality check we all need: the past is like a textbook - valuable for reference, but not meant to be our permanent residence.

## The Mental Prison We Build 🔒

Think about it. How many hours do you spend each week replaying that awkward conversation from last month? Or beating yourself up over a career choice you made five years ago? We've all been there, creating elaborate mental prisons where we're both the warden and the prisoner.

This backward-looking habit doesn't just waste time - it actively sabotages our present. When we're mentally living in yesterday, we miss the opportunities of today. It's like trying to drive while constantly staring in the rearview mirror. You're bound to crash into something good that's right in front of you.

## The Learning vs. Living Distinction 📚

There's a crucial difference between learning from the past and living in it. Learning means extracting the lesson, noting what worked and what didn't, then filing it away as wisdom for future use. Living in the past means replaying events endlessly, often with a soundtrack of regret or what-if scenarios.

**Learning from the past looks like:**
- Recognizing patterns in your behavior
- Understanding which decisions led to positive outcomes
- Identifying red flags you missed before
- Appreciating how far you've come

**Living in the past looks like:**
- Constantly rehashing old arguments
- Refusing to try new approaches because of previous failures
- Defining yourself by past mistakes
- Comparing every new situation to old ones

## Daily Strategies to Stay Present 🎯

### Morning Reality Check ☀️
Start each day by asking yourself: ""What can I do TODAY to move closer to where I want to be?"" This simple question shifts your brain from past-focused to future-oriented thinking.

### The 5-Minute Rule ⏰
When you catch yourself spiraling into past events, set a timer for 5 minutes. Allow yourself to think about it during those 5 minutes, then consciously redirect your attention to something in the present moment.

### Action Over Analysis 💪
Instead of analyzing why something went wrong in the past, spend that energy on taking one small action toward improvement today. Analysis paralysis keeps you stuck; action creates momentum.

### The Lesson Log 📝
Keep a simple note on your phone where you jot down lessons learned from challenging situations. Once you've written it down, consider the learning complete. No need to keep rehashing it mentally.

## The Opportunity Cost of Yesterday 💰

Every minute spent reliving the past is a minute not invested in building your future. Think about the compound interest of that time. If you spend 30 minutes daily dwelling on past mistakes, that's 182.5 hours per year - more than four full work weeks - invested in something that can't be changed.

What could you accomplish with those 182 hours instead? Learn a new skill? Build a side project? Strengthen relationships? Exercise more? The possibilities are endless when you redirect that mental energy forward.

## Breaking the Cycle 🔄

The pattern of living in the past often starts with good intentions. We tell ourselves we're being thoughtful or learning from mistakes. But there's a point where reflection becomes rumination, and rumination becomes a habit that holds us back.

**Practical Steps to Break Free:**

**Catch the Pattern** 👁️
Start noticing when your mind drifts to past events. Don't judge it - just notice it. Awareness is the first step to change.

**Ask Better Questions** 🤔
Instead of ""Why did this happen to me?"" try ""What can I do differently moving forward?"" The first question keeps you stuck; the second opens possibilities.

**Create Future Anchors** ⚓
Set specific, exciting goals that require your present attention. When your mind has something compelling to work toward, it's less likely to get stuck in reverse.

**Practice Present-Moment Activities** 🧘
Engage in activities that demand your full attention: cooking, exercising, having deep conversations, learning new skills. These naturally pull you into the now.

## The Forgiveness Factor 🤝

Often, living in the past is really about struggling to forgive - either ourselves or others. But forgiveness isn't about condoning what happened; it's about freeing yourself from the burden of carrying it forward.

You don't forgive for the other person's sake. You forgive for your own freedom. Every grudge you hold, every regret you carry, is weight that slows you down on your journey forward.

## Building a Forward-Looking Mindset 🌅

Developing a healthy relationship with time means treating the past like a consultant, not a commander. You check in with past experiences when you need guidance, but you don't let them make your current decisions.

**The Past as Consultant:**
""Based on what I learned before, what's the wisest approach here?""

**The Past as Commander:**
""I can't try this because something similar didn't work before.""

See the difference? One empowers you with wisdom; the other imprisons you with fear.

## Your Daily Action Plan 📋

Starting tomorrow, try this simple routine:

**Morning:** Spend 2 minutes identifying one thing you're excited to work on today.

**Midday:** When you catch yourself dwelling on the past, take three deep breaths and name three things you can see, hear, and feel right now.

**Evening:** Before bed, write down one thing you learned today and one thing you're looking forward to tomorrow.

This isn't about toxic positivity or pretending the past doesn't matter. It's about giving the past its proper place - as a teacher, not a prison warden.

## The Ripple Effect 🌊

When you stop living in the past, something interesting happens. The people around you notice. Your energy shifts. Instead of being the person who always brings up old stories or past grievances, you become the person who's focused on solutions and possibilities.

This change doesn't just benefit you - it elevates everyone in your circle. Your forward-looking energy becomes contagious, inspiring others to focus on what they can control and improve.

## The Ultimate Truth 💡

Here's what nobody tells you about the past: it's actually much less fixed than you think. Not the events themselves, but their meaning in your life. You have the power to rewrite the story of what those experiences mean for your future.

That failure from three years ago? It taught you resilience. That relationship that ended badly? It showed you what you really value. That career setback? It redirected you toward something better.

The past is only a prison if you choose to stay locked inside. The key has always been in your hand. The question isn't whether you can leave - it's whether you will.

Your best days aren't behind you. They're ahead of you, waiting to be created by the choices you make starting right now. The past gave you lessons. The present gives you power. Use both wisely. 🌟

1n20b2m,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1n20b2m/the_school_on_roosevelt_street/,The School on Roosevelt Street,"ONE.
My fascination with ghosts and the paranormal began 2 years ago. It was a cool summer night, and it was beginning to rain. Me and my friends, Dan and Todd, were walking back home from a ‘night on the town’, which isn't saying much as we live in a small town with a population of 1,400 people.

We were walking down Roosevelt street, despite Dan's protest. He hated taking this path home because of the decaying school that sat dormant on this street. Rumor around town was that the school is haunted. People say they have heard screaming and wailing from the school at night, but Todd says it's all bullshit.

It's a large modern brick building standing 2 floors tall and takes up the entire block. It was once a nice up-to-date school, but it closed down a couple years prior due to a dwindling student population. A year later it was bought by an old mechanic in town, and he intended to renovate it into a hotel, but the city said the school was on the verge of being condemned due to the west wing's second floor being on the verge of collapse. So now it sits nearly empty, the mechanic Charlie lives alone in the school and works out of the old auto shop room, so his investment wouldn’t be a complete waste. Charlie denies the claims of the school being haunted.

As we walked closer to the school Dan and Todd were arguing about how ‘haunted’ the school was.

“I just don’t see why we couldn’t take a different route home”  Dan said “this area gives me the heebie jeebies” 

“This is the fastest route home, and I'm not trying to get caught in the rain” Todd replied “It's just a bunch of small town gossip is all, this town has nothing else going on so they make things up to stay interesting” 

“I went here when I was a kid,” I added. “There's nothing scary about it. The closest occurrence we had was me almost dying of boredom a couple times.” 

“Yeah yeah very funny” Dan sighed “My dad says he refuses to step foot on this street after what he heard one night”

“Okay, but your dad is also a drunk, so who knows what he actually heard.” said Todd. 

As Dan and Todd continued bickering about how scary the school was, I heard a faint tapping sound coming from nearby. I stopped dead in my tracks, it sounded like a hand tapping on glass. 

“Guys shut up for a sec” I said “Do you hear that?”  

They slowed to a stop, and I realized the sound was coming from the direction of the school. The tapping sound became louder as if someone was beating on a window. I didn’t see anything at first, but as I looked closer into the school I saw the outline of a girl in one of the lower windows. 

“There! In-in the West Wing! Theres a- there's a girl in the window on the bottom floor!” I stammered as I grabbed my phone from my pocket. 

“Which window?” Todd asked “there's a lot of windows dude” 

“Oh Shit, there! I see her!” Dan yelled

I opened the camera on my phone to try record a video, but before I could I heard a piercing scream and I dropped my phone. 

I bent down and picked my phone up off the ground, when I looked back up she was gone. 

“Where'd she go?!” I asked frantically

“She dropped below the window” Dan responded “I don't see her anymore!” 

I continued looking around but Dan was right, she was gone. 

“Dammit” I exclaimed “I should have got that on video!” 

“I didn’t see anything” Todd stated “are you sure you saw a girl? That screech could have been anything.” 

“Yes dude, I'm sure! That was the scariest moment of my life. Now I'm ready to get the hell out of here, let’s go” Dan said, while picking up the pace back towards home. 

“Wait, shouldn't we find out what the hell that was?” I asked 

“How? Its private property?” Asked Todd “if you want to call the cops and tell them you saw a ghost girl in the school you can go right ahead, but I'm going to join Dan and get out of here, it's starting to rain” As he turned to catch up with Dan.

I cursed under my breath again, upset that I messed up what would have been the best ghost evidence on the internet. I took one more look at the school before turning around to join my friends. 


TWO:
That moment sparked my inspiration to start a youtube channel, so a couple months later Todd, Dan, and I created the Midwest Ghost Hunters. We have been on a dozen ghost hunts by now, with little to no evidence to show for it, but we have amassed 60k subscribers. 

The closest thing we have to evidence is a door closing on its own during our investigation of an abandoned mall. Todd is adamant that it was a draft, but Dan argues it was definitely something paranormal and that Todd is ignorant. Other than that though, all we have caught are some loud creaks and bangs while investigating abandoned houses, which I realize can easily be brushed off as nothing.

I am certain that our big break would be if we could investigate the school. Ever since word of our channel got around town, people have told me many stories regarding that building, and they insist that’s what we should investigate next. I've already tried asking the owner Charlie if I could, he said he would if he could but his insurance doesn’t want anyone else going in that building and that they are already opposed to him living there as is. So for now I have just been recording the neighborhoods stories to hopefully make into a video later. 


THREE:
I woke up this morning to my phone ringing. I rolled over disgruntledly to see Todd calling.

“What do you want?” I answered a bit harshly. 

“Well good morning to you too, Sunshine” Todd responded

“Well excuse me, It is 8am on a Saturday, what is so important that it couldn't have been a text?” I asked 

“Well, I call with good news” Todd said 

“Okay, well, what is it then” I replied curiously

“Charlie died” Todd stated a bit too excitedly 

I paused before asking “How is this good news Todd?” 

“Well it's not, but it's good for us at least. Because this means we can finally investigate the school,” he replied.

I took a moment, thinking it over, unsure what to say. I had only woken up moments ago, and now I'm being told Charlie is dead and that we should investigate his school. 

Todd added “Abby just told me. His body is going to the coroner's office this morning. An officer found his car wrapped around a tree, they suspect it happened last night.” 

Todd's wife Abby works for the city, so of course she has the inside scoop.

“There’s a slight hitch though,” Todd added. 

“What's that?” I asked 

“Well Abby tried to notify the next of kin, but all that he had listed was some guy down south. She told him the news, and he told her that he would be coming up in a couple days and that he is going to buy the school when he gets there.” Todd said. 

“That's odd” I added “he has quite the list of priorities I guess. What would he want with a condemned school anyways?”  

“I was wondering the same thing” Todd said “but regardless that means we would have to investigate it soon, before the buyer gets into town.” 

Todd was right, we could investigate the school now that Charlie is dead. It probably isn’t very considerate but it's a possibility nonetheless, and we wouldn't get another possibility like this again. 

“Okay, I’ll tell Dan,” I said finally “we will investigate the school tonight” 


FOUR:
It was well after dark as we approached the school. It's even more ominous when we are this close, especially when it is bathed in the night. The building looks weathered yet surprisingly current, and besides for the paint flaking and fading away, it looks just as I remember it from when I was a student. We crossed the empty parking lot and as we got to the front doors Todd spoke first. 

“Sooo do we just walk in through the front door, or did anyone make a plan for how we get inside?” He asked 

I looked over to Dan and he gave me a small shrug as a response. 

I responded “I guess I didn't consider that part. I put too much thought into whether or not we should and didn’t think about if we even could.” 

Dan let out a light chuckle saying “I was more worried about if it's more or less illegal to break into a man's house after he is dead. Is it still breaking and entering if he is dead, or is this just trespassing?” 

“I'm no lawyer, and I'm barely a ghost hunter, but from a legal standpoint, i'm gonna say maybe” I joked

“Well he did say he would be okay with it if it weren't for his insurance” Todd replied “who would we sue now if we got hurt?”

“Okay, that's a reasonable point I suppose” I said trying to make myself feel better about this potential crime “but we better figure out a way inside here soon, I don’t want any cops to see us. Anyone have any ideas?” 

Todd bent over and grabbed a large rock. 

“No, put that down dude” Dan said in a hushed shout “That would definitely be breaking and entering” 

“Well, do you have a better idea?” Todd asked

As Todd and Dan squabble about the most acceptable way to break into the school, I approached the front doors. I put my hands on the doors and gave it a little push, and to our surprise they actually opened. 

“He left them unlocked?” Asked Dan

“I guess” I responded “it is a small town after all, maybe he didn't plan to be out for long.” 

Todd and Dan entered the building behind me. The doors closed behind us and we could hear the sound echo throughout the vast building. We turned on our shoulder lights, the school still has power running to it, but we don’t want any neighbors to see the lights on.

The school has an odd aesthetic to it since it is now redesigned to be a home. We stood in the entryway which is a large open hallway now designed as a very open living room. There were a few display cases along the nearest wall that now holds Charlie's shoes and coats. The room has a few couches and an older TV, neither of them seemed to be used in a while. 

“You guys ready?” I asked as I pulled out the camera. 

“Yes, but please don't do your regular intro for our video” Todd pleaded

“Why not? I've done it for every video” I asked

“Dude, it's annoyingly stereotypical. If this video does blow up our channel like you say it will, we can't have that type of introduction for the new viewers” Todd stated

“Okay well do you want to do the introduction then?” I asked him. 

“Well no, that'd be even worse” he said

“Okay then. I’ll do the introduction my way then.” I stated

I turned the camera around to face me and hit record. “Good evening Midwest Ghost Viewers, we are back again with another investigative video! Tonight we are investigating my local school. This building is a bit of a local legend. There are so many terrifying stories about this location, so we just had to investigate it. So get ready to start believing in the paranormal, but before you do, don’t forget to like and subscribe.” 

I hit pause on the camera, and it  was followed by a deafening silence in the room. I could see Todd and Dan holding back laughter. 

“I agree with Todd, that shit sounds pathetic dude” Dan laughed finally

“Yeah I know” I said “It always does.” 

“That one hurt,” Todd chuckled while shaking his head. “Can we go explore now with that out of the way?” 

“Yes please” I said dejectedly 

To the right of the now living room is the gymnasium, and to the left is the swimming pool, we elected to explore the gymnasium first. 

The gymnasium didn’t appear to be altered at all, it also didn’t appear to have been used lately, the bleachers are dusty and the floor looks as if it hadn’t been swept in at least a year. 

I pulled out my camera to record some footage while we performed our tests. Our investigation usually starts with an ouija board, most ghost hunters claim this is complete BS, and honestly we agree, but it does provide some good content. We didn't get much if any movement from the board this time, besides for Todd trying to spell out P-E-N-I-S a couple times. The next test we like to try is the spirit box, Todd absolutely hates this device, and I can see why, but Dan is convinced it is legit. We let the spirit box run for a while. Dan said he heard some related words, but I think he was really stretching his imagination, because all I heard was incoherent nonsense. I usually check an EMF reader while we investigate, but it was very unreliable tonight due to the building actually having power for once. And speaking of power, the air conditioner scared the hell out of us a couple times during the testing. We are used to it being dead silent and we fine tune our ears to pick up any noises, so when the AC roared to life we all jumped.

Once we agreed we weren’t getting any evidence in this area we walked across the hall to the swimming pool. The room is humid and smells like chlorine despite the 12 foot pool being drained. The hot tub had a couple renovations from the last time I had seen it, there is now a TV mounted nearby and a new minifridge sitting adjacent. We ran a few tests in this room as well, with no proof yet again. 

We wandered over to the locker rooms which are just outside of the swimming area. We entered the men's room, and it appeared to be well used. I assume this was Charlie's main bathing area based off of the fresh towels sitting in the lockers and dirty laundry sitting in a hamper in the corner. The sink has a couple of new drawers built on to it, with his toiletries sitting on top. We didn’t stay in here for long or record any video, as it felt invasive even though he was gone. 

I stepped back into the hall and took an awkward glance into the women's locker room. 

“Hey bud, what ya looking at?” Dan asked, ""Is this how I find out you are a pervert?”

“I'm just curious, haven’t you wondered what a women's locker room is like?” I asked 

“Sure, but it’s probably the same as the men's just without the urinals, and maybe different paint” Todd stated

“Okay well don't you guys wanna find out, now is our chance” I said 

“Sure I suppose, why not?  Let's go peep in the girls bathroom” Todd said while walking in. 

When we entered the locker room we were surprised and speechless from what we saw. The women's room also appears to be well used, but by girls, which was concerning because Charlie didn't have a wife nor kids. The lockers contained towels and girls' clothing, ranging from children's size to adult. The doors on the stalls were removed. 

Todd broke the silence by saying “What- the- fuck. Are you guys disturbed by this as well” 

“This is definitely concerning, this doesn't make any sense” I replied

“Why would Charlie have girls' clothes here, and why so much? It’s just him that lives here.” Todd asked 

Before I had a chance to reply Dan shushed us. His eyes wide with fear, and stammered “I think I just heard someone knocking” 

“As in? Knocking how” Todd asked still focused on the locker room

“Like when you knock on somebody's front door politely waiting to be let inside” Dan said 

“Could it have been old pipes maybe?” Todd asked still looking around the locker room

“No, it definitely sounded like a hand knocking on a door. As in knock knock, who's there” Dan said “I'm telling you guys-”

Knock,Knock,Knock

He was interrupted by the knocking, it must have been louder this time as Todd and I both heard it clearly. Dan was right it definitely sounded like someone knocking on a door, even Todd looked like he agreed. 

I turned my camera on and we stepped back into the hall. 

I asked “is it coming from the front door? Did someone find out we are here?” 

“Maybe,” Dan said “it's so hard to tell, the building echoes so much” 

I started cautiously walking to the front door when we heard it again. 

Knock,Knock,Knock

“That sounded like it came from down the hall” Todd stated 

“That leads deeper into the school, that's the hall that brings you to either the West or East wings” I said

“Well I don't like that,” Dan said as the three of us began walking down the hall. 

The hall felt as if it was a mile long, and it felt like I was running one based on how hard my heart was beating. I'm excited that this will be the first bit of actual evidence we have ever gotten, but I am also terrified.

 We finally got to the end of the hall, there are two sets of double doors on either side of the hall. The right set of doors are open, they lead into the East wing which is the high school, assumedly where Charlie used to live. The left doors are chained shut, they lead into the west wing which is the elementary school, that is the condemned wing so that's probably why they are chained shut. 

“Which way do you think it came from” Todd asked

We got our answer as we heard another Knock,Knock,Knock to the left and I saw the west wing doors shake and bind against the chains. 

I slowly approached the doors and asked “Hello, who is it?” with false confidence.

In response we heard a quick pattering fleeing from the door, like little footsteps running away in a game of tag.

We sat in silence for a moment, my confidence quickly fading.  

Dan pushed on the doors and said “we have to get into the west wing, there is clearly something back there. Do you think Charlie left a key somewhere” while he pulled on the lock.

“Maybe” I replied “but actually the East and West wings share a lunch room, so the two sides meet up again at the cafeteria, maybe those doors are less secure and easier to break into.” 

“Well let's take a trip through the east wing then” Todd said “before that critter gets away.”

We all shared a look of agreement, and headed through the high school doors.


FIVE:
The high school side appears to be more taken care of, the carpet looks recently vacuumed and the walls have been repainted. We walk through the vacant halls, passing by empty class rooms. I recorded some more with the camera, while Dan and Todd were bickering yet again.

Dan said “there is no way you actually think that was an animal back there” 

“It had to be” Todd responded “what else could it be? A ghost? A ghoul? Some sort of monster maybe?” 

“We are GHOST hunting, so yes I do think it could be a ghost. That is the whole reason we are out here, that's what we are trying to find” Dan stated

Todd stayed quiet, probably because Dan has a pretty good point.

“What kind of animal do you think it was then?” Dan asked half jokingly 

“I don't know, that's why we are going over there. It has to be something pretty big though.” Todd said unconvincingly

“Oh come on dude, seriously? Do you hear yourself right now” Dan asked

We passed by the auto shop, it lay empty which seems odd to me. The shop hasn’t changed much, besides for the addition of Charlie's tools. The room is fairly dusty, but it's hard to tell if that's out of the ordinary for auto shops. The attached classroom is renovated into an office space. A newer computer sits atop his desk with a few file cabinets sitting along the nearby wall. We searched the office for his keys, but we found nothing, so we kept heading for the cafeteria.  


I led us through the next corridor, and through a shortcut through the library. It has been remodeled into an oversized living room area. A couple couches and a reclining chair sat around a large TV with a nice sound system. A couple of the bookshelves now hold an extensive collection of movies and CDs. We planned to come back to this room and investigate it further after we checked out the west wing. 


We took a quick detour to explore the principals’ office which is now Charlie's bedroom. The layout reminds me of a small apartment, there's a waiting room when you first walk in, which connects to Charlie's bedroom and main bathroom. It is well decorated, the waiting area has a couple plants sitting in the corners of the room and the walls are arranged with posters of old metal bands I don't recognize. His bedroom is also well kept, the bed is made and his nightstand seems organized. We searched this area as well, but did not have any more luck finding the keys. I was beginning to worry that he may have had the keys on him the night he died, but I tried to push that thought away as we continued our expedition to the cafeteria. 


We finally arrived at the cafeteria, it is a spacious room lined with rows of long tables. I looked closer at the tables and saw something that troubled me. There are about a dozen lunch trays loaded with food sitting on a couple of the tables. The food looks to be only a day or two old. I point it out to the guys, and Todd seems equally troubled by it. We were confused about why Charlie would need so many trays for himself, but Dan walked by us clearly more interested in the doors that connect to the West Wing, expressing a bravery we haven’t seen from him before. He stepped up to the doors and gave them a push, they are locked, so he took a couple steps back and before either Todd or I can protest he kicks the doors open. 

We caught up to Dan and I said “Y’know a heads up would have been nice”

Dan replied “Well we couldn't find the keys and I don’t know of any other ways in, so how else were we going to get into the elementary school?”

Todd said “I don't know dude, you didn't really give us any time to weigh our options.” 

“Okay well it's too late now, so why are we wasting time debating how to get through the doors when I've already kicked them down.” Dan asked smugly 

“Okay fair enough, you make a good point. Let's go then.” Todd said, leading the way into the elementary school. 

Before following them, I record a quick extra bit of footage of the cafeteria, still troubled by the lunch trays. Eventually I turn back towards my friends, hurriedly closing the gap into the West Wing. 


SIX:
The West Wing is more neglected, but still holds the appearance of an elementary school. Most of the rooms still have the old desks and classroom decor, but are covered in a heavy layer of dust. This side of the school smells musty and stale. All of the windows on this side are boarded up. The walls are painted pastel colors and the floors have colored lines which lead to different portions of the school. We saw no obvious signs of what was knocking on the door earlier, so we decided we should walk back to the first set of doors, in hopes that we might find something closer to where the knocking first occurred. 

As we got deeper into the elementary school, I noticed something. The West Wing is in very nice condition, it looks clearly abandoned, but it didn't appear to be on the verge of collapse like Charlie said it was. I mentioned it to the guys. 

“Hey, does this wing look very condemned to you two?” I asked 

They paused to look around, 

Todd said ""I'm no building inspector, but I would agree, this wing does look pretty nice so far, I wouldn't condemn it.” 

Dan commented “I thought Charlie said it was the second floor that was dangerous, we haven't made it up there yet.” 

“I guess” I said “but I assumed there would be damage on the first floor as well, if the second floor was about to collapse.”  

They just shrugged and continued exploring.  


As we traipsed past the computer lab, Dan stopped us silently raising a hand. 

“What's up? Why are you acting all black ops right now?” Todd whispered

“Do you hear that?” Dan asked “do you hear that humming?” 

We fell silent and I heard it. It's a sing-songy type of humming coming from within the computer lab. We exchange nervous glances, and I lead the way slowly prowling into the room. The lab has numerous computers lining every wall and a couple rows down the middle. I can hear the humming clearer now that we are inside, but I can't quite make out the song. We can’t see the source of the humming right away, so we split up to get a better look.

I slowly approach one of the middle rows. I apprehensively looked under the desks, and I discover what is singing. A young girl is crouched under the desk on the far end. She's wearing a dirty stained nightgown and her hair is matted. She is rocking back and forth slowly, and I can now hear her whimpering “they need help” as she hums. I froze, unsure how to proceed. She must have felt my eyes on her because she quit humming and sits still. Slowly she turns her head to look at me. She looks me dead in the eyes unblinking, and lets out an ear piercing raspy shriek. I jump back terrified and she leaps at me. I narrowly avoid her, but I somehow manage to drop the camera as she runs by me and towards the door. 

She ran into the hall screaming, “YOU SHOULDN'T BE HERE!” and “GET OUT!” 

I look back at the guys, they both sit petrified. 

“Guys! Snap out of it, we gotta follow her” I yell while picking up my camera off the floor. Thankfully it still works. Dan rushed to my side and we ran into the hall in the direction the girl fled.

We rounded the corner at the end of the corridor and see the girl standing completely still with her hand pointing towards the stairs. I stop and pull out my camera, recording clear footage of the girl. 

She whispers “they are up there, please help us.” 

Dan said “fuck this dude, im out. We got our footage, that's enough for me.” and turns around racing towards the nearest exit.

“Dan! Wait!” I yell pleading 

I turn back towards the girl, but she’s gone. Nervously I look around for her, I see fresh footprints in the dust that lead upstairs, but I'm not about to go up there alone.

“Yeah fuck this” I agree and run back the same way as Dan. 

I found Dan and Todd back in the computer lab. Todd shook out of his horror, but he was still spooked. I approached him saying “It's time to go buddy. I got our footage, let's leave”. Dan nodded in anxious agreement, leading us out the door.

We quickly retrace our steps back to the cafeteria. I am a bit concerned about Todd, I've never seen him this quiet before, but Dan is able to escort him out ahead of me. 


We made it back to the cafeteria without event. I turned back momentarily to close the doors behind us, then we paused briefly to catch our breath. 

“What the hell was that?” Dan asked, still rattled.

“I think that was our first ghost,” I said excitedly.

“Once we get out of here I can't wait to say I told you so” Dan said playfully pushing Todd

Todd laughed anxiously “yeah, I guess you guys are right. I think that was actually a ghost. Did you get it on camera?” 

“Oh yeah I did. This video is gonna blow us up. The footage I got is perfect, I’d dare to say the best evidence on the entire internet” I responded

“You guys ready to go home so we can get that footage posted then?” Dan asked 

“Yes I am very ready to get the hell out of here” Todd said.

We headed back the way we came, following our footsteps through the highschool, through the once home of old Charlie. I still have a lot of questions after this expedition, but for now I'm focusing on getting home. 


SEVEN:
We made it through the high school easily, and got back to the hallway that divides the west and east wings. I let out a sigh of relief as I saw the entryway doors at the end of the hall. I took a moment near the West doors to look at the chains, when the door slowly creaked open and rattled as it bound against the chains. A face now peering at us through the gap. As soon as I locked eyes with her, the doors began to violently shake, and I heard a girl's voice yelling and crying.

“LET US OUT, PLEASE. Please, you have to set us free. Help us.”

She started pounding heavily on the door and continued pleading, but we already began running in the opposite direction. 

We barged through the entry way doors, and I was half tempted to kiss the ground as I stepped foot on the parking lot. I looked around at my friends, their faces mixed with emotions partially excited but also terrified. We recorded a quick outro outside of the school, I'm unsure if it will be usable since we are so clearly shaken up. Dan gave a couple middle fingers to the old school, but Todd and I didn't look back. Finally I put the camera away and we got into my car, relieved to be heading home, and ready to post the video of what we found. 

EIGHT:
It didn't take long for the video to blow up like we suspected. I spent the entire next day editing the video so I could post it as soon as possible. I was able to post it on Sunday night, just a day after our investigation. By Thursday the video was on the trending tab with a million views. Our channel blew up, gaining a half of a million subscribers already and didn't seem to be slowing down any time soon. We received a dozen DMs from other creators asking to collab or to ask us for the location of the school. But one DM stuck out in particular, it was from an individual named Josh. He was insistent on getting information about the girl we saw. 

Josh: Hey guys, my name is Josh Henshaw. I just saw your video and I know this may sound odd, but I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions about the girl. Its urgent 

His message made me curious so I agreed. “Sure, what do you want to know about her?” 

Josh: Did you happen to see her eyes? If so, what color were they?

“I didn't really get a good look at them, it was too dark in there”

Josh: How about her right forearm? Did you see a scar shaped like a dog bite on her arm? 

I didn't remember much about her arm, so I looked back at the footage. I start by rewatching when she leapt at me in the computer lab. That's when I noticed something. I didn't drop the camera, she knocked it out of my hands when she jumped at me. I could clearly see her hand hitting the camera, and it was the same arm Josh asked about. I took a closer look at her arm and saw she did indeed have a dog bite shaped scar.

I sent another message to Josh, “Yes she does have a scar on her arm. How did you know that?” 

Josh: I thought that was her. Please, you need to tell me the location of the school. I can meet you somewhere if you don't trust me.” 

“I'm not telling you anything more until you tell me how you knew about her scar” 

Josh: Okay fine. I know about her scar because I think the girl you saw in the school is my missing sister.

There is a photo attached to the message. I opened it and saw a missing person poster, the girl on the poster looks exactly like the girl I saw in the school that night. Her name is Lucy Henshaw and she went missing nine months ago from a nearby county. 

I replied to Josh immediately with my phone number and gave him the location of the school. He told me he doesn't live too far from here, and we agreed to meet at my apartment tonight and then go to the police with our findings. 


NINE:
I stand outside the school once again with Josh, Todd, and Dan; but this time the school is bathed in flashing red and blue lights as the sun is setting behind it. The school is surrounded by what appears to be every police officer and EMT in town. The officers breached the school just moments ago and we were told to wait in the parking lot. 

Josh made it into town earlier this evening. As soon as he came into my apartment I knew he was telling the truth, I could see it in his eyes, they looked just like Lucy's. We skipped all formalities as he told me all the details of her disappearance. After I answered all of Josh's questions we went to the police station. 
 
We told the story to the officer at the front desk. Officer Andersen didn’t seem to be convinced with our ghost girl in the school story, until I showed him the video and Josh pulled out the missing persons poster. Andersen put on his glasses to get a closer look at the girl, and saw that we were serious. He showed our proof to some of the nearby officers, they unanimously agreed to start an investigation. 

Then a couple hours later we arrived here. We weren't technically invited to join the investigation, but no one stopped us either.  

We sat in the parking lot for what felt like the entire night, but according to my watch it has been only 45 minutes. The sun has fully set by now and the night sky is beginning to take over. 


Finally the front doors opened, one of the officers exited the building with his arm around Lucy. Josh ran up to her as fast as he could without frightening her. Lucy watched him tensely until she recognized him, then she smiled and fell into his arms. He said something to her but I was out of earshot and I didn't want to intrude. 

The front doors opened again and two more officers walked out, holding a couple of young girls in their arms. The girls are gauntly thin, they look sickly but are alive nonetheless. The officers rushed them over to the ambulance. Todd pointed me to the front doors again and I saw three more officers rush out with girls in their arms as well.

I overheard the two officers talking to the EMTs “there are a couple more girls inside yet, Andersen is working on getting them free right now. One teen and one adult. These girls were chained upstairs in the elementary art room.” 

The other officer pointed to Lucy and said “that girl gave us quite the scare in there, she was the only girl not chained up. She said she escaped her chains last week and hit a ‘bad man’ with a brick, but she hasn’t seen him since.”

The three other officers approached the ambulances, setting the girls on the available gurneys, and asked how they could help. An officer named Lincoln turned to us and told us he is going to take Lucy back to the station to treat her there, and see what else she is willing to tell us tonight. Josh and I agreed to come with. 


TEN:
By morning a lot of my questions became answered.  Lucy was very open about her experiences in the school. She was very brave, with encouragement from her big brother Josh. She started by telling us that she tried to hurt Charlie with a brick because he was a bad man, but she couldn’t hit him hard enough and he dragged her back upstairs. That was the night that Charlie got into a car accident, Lincoln is going to look further into the autopsy but suspects Lucy gave him a concussion and that caused him to veer off the road as he was driving to the hospital. Eventually Lucy was able to escape her chains again, but couldn’t escape the West Wing since the doors were locked and the windows are boarded up. I felt pretty bad for closing the doors behind me as we fled that night. 

She also told us that Charlie has been kidnapping the girls from nearby towns. Lincoln pointed out that most of the girls rescued from the school are in the missing persons databases of neighboring counties. He showed the database to Lucy and she was able to point out a few more girls that used to be at the school but were picked up by another ‘bad man’. She said he comes from the south to pick up the girls who don’t behave. I told Lincoln about the man who was listed as Charlie's ‘next of kin’ that Todd mentioned last week. Lincoln pulled up the man's information and found his photo. He showed the photo to Lucy, she cried but confirmed it was him. His name is Arnold, and he even looked like a creep. He should have made it into town by now according to my conversation with Todd. Lincoln had his doubts that he would show at all, but said they would keep trying to reach him until he is caught. 

Later when the IT department went through the computer in Charlie's office and they validated what Lucy said. They found hundreds of messages between Charlie and Arnold that revealed a bigger trafficking ring led by Arnold. At that point they turned the case over to the FBI for a large-scale operation.  

That was the last of officer Lincoln's questioning. Then the on-site nurse gave Lucy a quick evaluation. Lucy said she felt fine, so the nurse told her to get plenty of rest over the next few days and drink plenty of water. Lucy asked about the other girls in the school; the nurse said they are all going to be okay and that the officers are reaching out to their parents now.

Finally Lincoln said we are free to leave, but we have to stay in town until the investigation is complete. I extended an offer to Josh and Lucy to stay at my place for a few days, which they accepted. We left the department grateful for all they have done, but hopeful we wouldn't have to return any time soon.


ELEVEN:
We arrived at my apartment before noon. Before I could even offer my bedroom to Lucy she was asleep on the couch. Josh fell asleep on the recliner adjacent to her, unwilling to leave her side. I left two glasses of water on the coffee table with a note telling them to help themselves to anything in the kitchen. I walked into my bedroom and turned on my computer. Officer Lincoln told me to delete the video of the school for the remainder of the investigation. I wasn’t sure how long that would be, so I began writing my experiences here while the memories and emotions are still fresh. Surprisingly my Youtube channel no longer feels as important. I have new friends to care for now, along with my old ones. Maybe a break from ghost hunting will do me good, because I certainly found more than I was hoping to. 

So that’s all for now Midwest Ghost Viewers, until next time. Thank you…
