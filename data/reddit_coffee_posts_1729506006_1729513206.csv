1g8o8gj,https://www.reddit.com/r/AncientCoins/comments/1g8o8gj/need_help_identifying_roman_coins/,Need help identifying Roman coins. ,"Hello Reddit,   
I've been a long-time coin collector and have recently gotten into ancient coins (I'm a massive history nerd for Classical Antiquity) ! 

  
A while back I had purchased some Roman coins (or at least I hope they're legitimate). The first I think I've identified as a coin from Emperor Postumus from the breakaway state of the Gallic Empire (260-269), a fitting coin since I live in a city that belongs to this state. (First image), this coin weighs between 3.2 and 3.3 grams and is about 2.1 cm in diameter. 

https://preview.redd.it/lwtooor9o3wd1.png?width=433&format=png&auto=webp&s=2ebd8ea25ed42b03ce1d161d462c419b15bdee68

The second coin poses more of a problem. I believe it belongs to a Gordian, which one is the problem (there's 3). The coin weights 4.1 grams and has a diameter of roughly 2.2 cm.

As to the metal content of these coins, its clearly not bronze or gold (I wish haha). I'm guessing since they seem to date from the 3rd century that they're not pure silver as Rome debased their currency substantially by this point in the Empire. I'm guessing billon? 

  
I really apologize for the poor quality of these images, I own an Android and drank too much coffee this morning.... 

I'm curious as to their denomination, rough dates of minting and if possible the location where they were minted. I doubt they're ""Antoninianus"" since those are heavier...",1,1729512951.0,AncientCoins,0,1.0,False

I have had chronic constipation my whole life. I’ve tried every different way of eating and drinking, gone to a pelvic floor PT, GI, taken laxatives and nothing seemed to work. But recently I was determined to fix it naturally and tried many different things. I’d love to share what worked as it’s really simple. I don’t know if it’ll work for you, but who knows! 

The main thing that helped:
Taking this amazing supplement. One before I go to bed and one first thing when I wake up(both on an empty stomach). 
It’s called Tri-magnesium by Integrative therapeutics. 
I tried many other magnesium supplements over the years and this is the only one that helped with my constipation! 

I also try to drink a cup of organic pure prune juice around 5 days a week. 

Most mornings I get a coffee with espresso(drip coffee does nothing for me) and I put MCT oil in it. But sometimes I just drink the MCT oil with water if I can’t put it in coffee. I use the bulletproof brand. 

If I’m really desperate on rare occasions I’ll drink some salt water first thing in the morning followed by lots of regular water. 

About my diet- I noticed over eating foods like bread and chips really back me up. So I try to stay away! 

With all this, I’m never constipated anymore. I hope any of this was helpful for people, I know how hopeless it can feel. Reddit has helped me so much I thought I’d give something back! ",1,1729512678.0,Constipation,0,1.0,False

1g8o3z7,https://www.reddit.com/r/airplanechefs/comments/1g8o3z7/airplane_chefs_choosing_your_locations_and/,Airplane Chefs: Choosing your locations and upgrades,"As of October 2024, there are 14 playable locations in Airplane Chefs. They are

* Cape Town
* Denver
* London
* Mexico City
* ~~Moscow~~ (Currently undergoing reworks and unavailable for those who have not unlocked it previously)
* Mumbai
* Naples
* New York
* Paris
* Rio de Janeiro
* Sapporo
* Singapore
* Sydney
* Tokyo

Each location has different mechanics, as well as different ways to prepare food, and it varies in difficulty in terms of upgrade costs and level difficulty. In this guide, I will be giving you a guide on each location, how difficult it is, and what upgrades do you need most.

Bear in mind that locations which are italicised are those where you would need to prioritise your trash compactor and bag more than others

**Cape Town**

Cape Town airport has very unique mechanic, where players use a grill instead of a traditional oven. There is also a dish (roosterkoek) where players have to prepare the sausages first, before they place it in the roosterkoek and then the grill again. It is of utmost importance that the grill be prioritised over any other equipment

Upgrade difficulty: High (roosterkoek costs a lot to upgrade in particular)  
Level difficulty: Moderate

Equipment to upgrade: Grill and Billtong Slicer  
Food item to upgrade: Boerewors, Chakalaka (costs no gems) and Hertzoggie (cheaper than most other desserts)

**Denver**

The first airport that everyone unlocks by default, expect things to be rather easy here. You will learn the basic mechanics of the game. Also, you do not have to worry at all about trash compactors being unavailable,

Upgrade difficulty: Very Low  
Level difficulty: Very Easy (Newer players may struggle but don't worry, you'll get used to it)

Equipment to upgrade: Main and Quick Ovens  
Food item to upgrade: All the items are pretty cheap, so upgrade as you wish

**London**

Upgrade Difficulty: Low  
Level Difficulty: Moderate

Equipment to upgrade: Quick Oven and Apple Juice Dispenser  
Food item to upgrade: Biscuits (costs no gems), Earl Grey Tea and Apple Juice

***Mexico City***

Mexico City is a pretty complex location, meant for more experienced players. First, you have to cook beef in a pan and sometimes you have to place cheese on it before using a quesadilla pan (where you have to flip halfway). There is also a blender to make licuados, which is important

Upgrade Difficulty: Moderate  
Level Difficulty: Hard

Equipment to upgrade: Quesadilla Pan, Beef Pan and Quick Oven (Blender is important but these 3 are much more important)  
Food item to upgrade: Beef, Tortilla Chips and Taco Toppings

***Moscow***

(Moscow is currently unavailable for all players who have not unlocked it previously. Players who unlocked it previously can access it)

Upgrade Difficulty: Very High (most expensive location in gem cost)  
Level Difficulty: Hard

Equipment to upgrade: Kvass and Lemonade Dispensers, Main Oven  
Food item to upgrade: Zefir, Caviar (costs no gems) and Sour Cream

***Mumbai***

This is easily the hardest location to play in game. Do not play it unless you are skilled and experienced enough.

Upgrade Difficulty: High  
Level Difficulty: Extreme

Equipment to upgrade: Curry Pan and Paneer Cutter  
Food item to upgrade: Paneer Cheese, Jamun Chutney and Rice

**Naples**

This is in my opinion, the easiest location to play besides the first 2 airports (Denver and Sydney)

Upgrade Difficulty: Moderate  
Level Difficulty: Easy

Equipment to upgrade: Pizza Oven and Meat Slicer  
Food item to upgrade: Pizza dough, Prosciutto Ham and Caprese Salad

***New York***

(You will need to upgrade your trash bag a lot because you will be preparing a lot of flat whites)

Upgrade Difficulty: High  
Level Difficulty: Hard

Equipment to upgrade: Coffee, Milk and Cream Soda Dispensers (believe it or not, your drinks are most important here)  
Food item to upgrade: Half Moon Cookie, Cheesecake and Cream Soda (all 3 items are very frequently ordered and are way cheaper than pastrami ham)

**Paris**

Upgrade Difficulty: Moderate  
Level Difficulty: Hard

Equipment to upgrade: Crepe Oven and Baguette Slicer (seriously, these 2 are lifesavers)  
Food item to upgrade: Crepes, Eclairs, and Cafe Au Lait 

**Rio de Janeiro**

There are no first class seats to upgrade, just like Denver

Upgrade Difficulty: Moderste  
Level Difficulty: Easy

Equipment to upgrade: Waffle Maker, Mixer and Ice Cream DIspenser  
Food item to upgrade: Quindim, Fruit Salad, Chimichurri Sauce, Ice Cream

**Sapporo**

(Remember to add the rice to the nigiri maker regularly)

Upgrade Difficulty: Moderate  
Level Difficulty: Extreme

Equipment to upgrade: Rice Cooker, Nigiri Maker and Trays (Salmon and Tuna)  
Food item to upgrade: Rice, Sencha and Soy Sauce (costs no gems)

**Singapore**

This is the location which gives you the best return of investment. You generally earn the most smiles here, especially at levels 44, 45, 47 and 49

Upgrade Difficulty: High  
Level Difficulty: Hard

Equipment to upgrade: Yoghurt Machine, Coffee and Tea Heaters  
Food item to upgrade: Rice, Salad and Asian Flank Steak

**Sydney**

This is the second location you will play in game. Upgrades here are still cheaper than average, although levels get a little harder

Upgrade Difficulty: Low  
Level Difficulty: Easy

Equipment to upgrade: All 3 ovens and ginger lemonade dispenser  
Food item to upgrade: Vegetables, Steak and Balmain Bug

**Tokyo**

Upgrade Difficulty: Very High  
Level Difficulty: Hard

Equipment to Upgrade: Rice Cooker, Onigiri Maker and Kakigori Machine  
Food item to upgrade: Miso Soup, Rice and Soy Sauce (costs no gems)

**General upgrading tips**

- You can live without warmers, freezers and cup holders. They wiill definitely help but are not a requirement  
- Pantry stocks help as well, but there is no urgency in upgrading them  
- Besides the above mentioned locations, you just have to upgrade your trash compactors and bags only around once or twice each. They have been italicised because they produce a lot more trash than the others.  
- You do not need a lot of trays, one or two upgrades should do the trick

My upgrade suggestions DO NOT MEAN that you should not purchase any of your other upgrades, just that these are those which you should prioritise and they will also make your life easier as well..

We like to drink French press coffee, so you need to boil water. They have a little teapot. At home, I just use a regular pot.

I leave the spout stuck open, so I don’t have to listen to it screaming. I know when it’s boiling, I can see it, and I can even hear the difference in the teapot itself. 

I’ve always had some misophonia, not super-crippling, but the last 6-7 years have been much worse for me.

After a botched procedure, I now have a permanent 7-year-long-earache, and extreme hypersensitivity, so some noises cause me great pain, as well as the anxiety. Like the teapot, or squeaky shoes in the house. 

Anyway, I’d start my water, for my OWN coffee, and my dad would sneak in behind me and flip the spout down, so it could whistle.

He did this like 4-5 times, even after explaining to him, very nicely, over and over, that my ear really hurts, and that this sound bothers me.

I finally asked him, “My darling father! **WHY are you doing this?** The sound REALLY hurts my ear; it doesn’t affect you, or the quality of the water I’m boiling; so, what’s up?”

All he can say is, “I am a creature of habit.” 

Meaning, while MY bones and lungs want to explode from anxiety and pain at certain sounds, I guess HIS bones and lungs wanna explode, from the anxiety of not letting the teapot scream. The world is NOT right if that spout is stuck open. I think he has some mild, undiagnosed OCD, or something similar.

I am very quiet about his many other ‘sounds’, that I won’t get into. He would take it very personally, if I said something, and we don’t live together - so for a few days, I can live with him… and his *noises.* 

But this isn’t remotely personal! it is a fucking TEAPOT!

I don’t even try to explain Misophonia to them. Even if I did not grow up with Misophonia, the teapot whistle **would still hurt my ear** because of the bad surgery. 

It's just so strange, how people perceive our misophonia, and seem to universally think we are over-dramatic assholes.  

My very genuine reaction, of holding my ear and yelling, desperately trying to get to the teapot to stop the noise, is not put-on, it is PAIN! And I can’t help it!

Do the people you live with have disrespectful little quirks like this? 

I actually thought he was messing with me, after the 2nd or 3rd time, but I don’t think so.

My wife (41F) and I (42M) have been married for 15 years. 

I apparently surprised her by being capable of doing household chores and tasks, which I didn't think much of. My mom always asked me to help out with chores when I was a kid so I didn't think it was beneath me or anything.

I do think I inherited her need to clean excessively, like it's so bad that I can't eat until a mess is dealt with. My Mom is an amazing cook, my Aunt was a literal chef at a fancy hotel and my dad loved having barbeques.  It was pretty natural to learn from them and pick up a thing or two.

The only thing I didn't pick up was how to make a decent cup of tea or coffee, I'm genuinely awful at it. It got to a point where I was handling most of the household chores and taking care of cooking, which I prefer anyways since she comes home exhausted.

I've been asking our children (11F and 9M) to do some minor tasks around the house and hopefully teach them this sort of thing too. She has a group of friends who hang out regularly, this time it was her turn to host the group at her home.

I offered to take our children out for the day, and it was all set. Before we left, I had to finish up some things for work. The office space is practically on top of our living room, so I could hear what they were talking about the entire time.

One of the friends asked how she always kept our house so spotless and my wife just bragged about how she was responsible for it all.

Then they all started talking about their gripes with their marriages, a common theme was how unhelpful their spouses were. I felt pretty uncomfortable so I just left the office and went out with the kids.

I came back after they had left for the night and acted as normal until we got to our bedroom. I asked her what was up with that conversation they had and pointed out that I did the cooking and cleaning in our marriage.

She told me not to take it personally, and that she just wanted to fit in with the struggles of her friends. Now I just feel unappreciated, especially since I don't clearly remember any genuine gratitude for what I do from her.

Since then, she's been pretty short with me. She says I'm weaponizing what I'm doing against her and holding it over her head.

I don't expect her to compliment me each time I clean or defend me religiously, just a little 'My husband is pretty helpful actually, he does his share' would be nice. I can't help but feel like her friends think I'm some sort of deadbeat who comes home to relax and neglect her.",4,1729512253.0,AITAH,3,1.0,False

1g8nyzb,https://www.reddit.com/r/NoStupidQuestions/comments/1g8nyzb/how_can_i_best_support_my_best_friend_after_his/,How can I best support my best friend after his recent divorce?,"My best friend (M38) just got divorced; a week ago he moved into a tiny apartment over an hour away from where I live. We caught up this weekend over a few beers. He told me he was doing ""better than expected"", but he also confessed that he is worried about being lonely and ""not having anyone to talk to"" when he comes home from work.     
     
He's not the type to easily share his deeper feelings - usually only after some liquid courage - so I'm taking his concerns *very* seriously.     
     
For context: he's battled depression and anxiety in the past and took some weeks off work this summer due to stress. Given that and the fact that we live in Scandinavia where winters are dark and long, I'm particularly concerned about his mental health.     
         
During our talk, I stressed that I am here whenever he needs to talk or just wants a distraction. However, he told me flat out that he probably won't call me even if he needs it. I asked if he'd prefer if I called him for a chat from time to time (we're millennials ie we communicate via text normally), but he declined that too. I kinda left it at that, but it's been on my mind since...      
He doesn’t talk much about his feelings with his other friends, despite some of them also having gone through divorce. He tends to open up more with me (I’m a woman, and I think that plays a role).      
     
Here’s my dilemma: I have a partner, a toddler, and a full-time job, so I can’t drive over to him regularly. I don’t want to crowd him, but I also don’t want him to feel isolated or alone.     
I have come up with some ideas;     
     
* inviting him to family dinners at our house. But I worry that might feel like a reminder of what he's lost.     
* sending random texts and memes to brighten his day and keep up some casual contact without putting pressure on him to respond.     
* planning occasional outings. Low-pressure activities like grabbing a coffee or going for a walk, but I’m not sure how often would be too much or too little.     
* more spontaneous hangouts, like visiting a playground near his apartment with my daughter - something low-key that doesn't feel like I'm doing him a favour.       
     
What do you think? Are any of these ideas good ways to support him, or are there better approaches I haven’t thought of?     

I’m looking for advice - especially from those who’ve been through a divorce - on how to support my friend without crossing his boundaries. I know therapy would likely help him, but that’s not something he’s likely to pursue, so I’m seeking other ways to be there for him.     
     
**What are some things your friends did for you that helped, or what do you wish they had done?**     
     
     
    
**TL;DR** my best friend is going through a divorce. I am worried about him and want to know how to best support and help him. I have tried asking, but he struggles to express what he needs, so I’m looking for advice on how to be there for him while respecting his boundaries.",2,1729512093.0,NoStupidQuestions,0,1.0,False

My wife (41F) and I (42M) have been married for 15 years. 

I apparently surprised her by being capable of doing household chores and tasks, which I didn't think much of. My mom always asked me to help out with chores when I was a kid so I didn't think it was beneath me or anything.

I do think I inherited her need to clean excessively, like it's so bad that I can't eat until a mess is dealt with. My Mom is an amazing cook, my Aunt was a literal chef at a fancy hotel and my dad loved having barbeques.  It was pretty natural to learn from them and pick up a thing or two.

The only thing I didn't pick up was how to make a decent cup of tea or coffee, I'm genuinely awful at it. It got to a point where I was handling most of the household chores and taking care of cooking, which I prefer anyways since she comes home exhausted.

I've been asking our children (11F and 9M) to do some minor tasks around the house and hopefully teach them this sort of thing too. She has a group of friends who hang out regularly, this time it was her turn to host the group at her home.

I offered to take our children out for the day, and it was all set. Before we left, I had to finish up some things for work. The office space is practically on top of our living room, so I could hear what they were talking about the entire time.

One of the friends asked how she always kept our house so spotless and my wife just bragged about how she was responsible for it all.

Then they all started talking about their gripes with their marriages, a common theme was how unhelpful their spouses were. I felt pretty uncomfortable so I just left the office and went out with the kids.

I came back after they had left for the night and acted as normal until we got to our bedroom. I asked her what was up with that conversation they had and pointed out that I did the cooking and cleaning in our marriage.

She told me not to take it personally, and that she just wanted to fit in with the struggles of her friends. Now I just feel unappreciated, especially since I don't clearly remember any genuine gratitude for what I do from her.

Since then, she's been pretty short with me. She says I'm weaponizing what I'm doing against her and holding it over her head. I didn't intend for that or to make her feel guilty at all.

I don't expect her to compliment me each time I clean or defend me religiously, just a little 'My husband is pretty helpful actually, he does his share' would be nice. I can't help but feel like her friends think I'm some sort of deadbeat who comes home to relax and neglect her.

1g8noxp,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarlifestyleforum/comments/1g8noxp/i_found_out_the_actually_real_identity_of_my/,I found out the actually real identity of my sugar daddy - what should I do?,"SUMMARY at the bottom

Hey everyone, I’m in need of some advice as I’m pretty new to this whole sugar dating scene. For context, I’m 19, live in a big European city, and study a STEM degree at university.

I started looking for a sugar daddy on MySugarDaddy.com at the end of August when I was still 18. I didn’t use SA because it’s not as popular in Europe, and in early September, I found a guy X Y. After chatting for a few days on the site, we exchanged phone numbers. He sent me his first, which felt like a good sign. We talked and called each other for about 10 days before meeting in person, during which we also exchanged pictures (nothing explicit). He complimented me, calling me beautiful and sweet. I noticed he didn’t mention a wife or ex-wife, just ""family."" He asked if I’d had any sugar relationships before, and I said no. He said he had one for a year. 

So, 10 days later, mid-September, we met for coffee in a nearby less popular town. He is super handsome, like Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister), but his hair was more silver fox than the dirty blonde in his photos. He introduced himself as X Y, and we talked for about two hours. He asked me about my studies, and I asked him about his job, though he didn’t share the company he works for. He said privacy is really important to him, and I can understand that because I’m a private person too.

We discussed the nature of our arrangement. He explained that he’s pretty well-known and couldn’t take me to restaurants, dates or other public places where sugar daddies might usually bring their sugar babies. But he said maybe in the future as trust builds up he would bring me to his work related trips. I understood that as other sd told me the exact same thing, plus the fact the country we live in isn’t very accepting of these relationships doesn’t help. 

He wanted us to meet four or five times a month, only during weekdays, since he spends weekends with his ""family."" He offered to cover my beauty expenses and buy me clothes he wanted me to wear, plus an allowance I decided and some gifts like around my birthday and Christmas. He also said he wanted exclusivity in the sugaring scene, but if I wanted a boyfriend, that it would be fine with him as long as I was upfront. He was even willing to give me advice about guys. I was absolutely ok with it and deleted my profile on MSD that night. 

I didn’t really know what I wanted since this was my first time in this type of relationship, and I also told him that I didn’t have much sexual experience. He was totally fine with that and said there was no rush. He was respectful, and I felt comfortable.

We met for the first time in late September. He picked me up at the underground, and we went to a hotel he paid for. I was nervous, but he was great about it. He made it clear that we didn’t have to do anything I wasn’t ready for and that I could leave at any time. We only did some light petting that day.

After about 12 days, we met again as he was super busy. I told him I was ready to lose my virginity and asked him to bring condoms. He actually told me he didn’t think I looked ready and that we could wait, but I insisted. When we did, he was incredibly thoughtful and made sure I was comfortable. It wasn’t a painful or bad experience like some of my friends’ first times. He did a lot of foreplay, and the whole experience was way better than I expected.

Things were going smoothly, but I noticed that X Y was really needy with communication—more than my best friend and my mom combined. He would often say that I never told him I missed him. I started wondering if he was saying that to argue and find an excuse to end our arrangement. My best friend suggested I create a fake profile on the site to see if he was still active, and it turned out he was. I wasn’t too surprised but felt conflicted. We had agreed to be exclusive, but I also understand that men aren’t always trustworthy. He chatted on the fake profile the same things he did with me at the beginning. I just chatted with him that evening and I deactivated the profile as I started to get pissed off. 

Later that evening he messaged me asking again if I missed him, and I kind of snapped. I told him I’m not good at expressing emotions and that his constant need for reassurance was suffocating me a bit. He seemed to take it well and said he understood. Then, the next day, in the afternoon, that was also the day before we were supposed to meet I sent him a message saying we needed to talk. He got super anxious, thinking something was seriously wrong, so I reassured him immediately saying it wasn’t that bad. He called me, and I explained everything, sending him a screenshot of the fake profile. He wasn’t happy about it, but he didn’t yell or lose his cool. He said he understood why I did it and even called it ""smart"" because he knew some men take advantage of girls in these situations. However, he was pissed that I had let him think it was something way more serious like pregnancy or blackmail. 
I explained to him why I did it and just told me that he was bored waiting for an appointment plus he knew he was me to shrug it off. I was disappointed as I knew these were excuses. We didn’t meet the next day as he was pissed. 

We met a few days later to talk. At the reception desk, as I was early and X Y told me to just wait for him in the room. I mentioned the name to the girl —X Y—but the reservation didn’t exist under that name. So I text him and he called the receptionist saying everything was fine and to let me go. 
The moment he entered the room, he kissed me and said he missed me. He repeated what he told me on the phone: that I could and should trust him in this relationship and that if he ever wanted to leave, he would have already done it but he didn’t. He reassured me that sugar daddies can lose much more than sugar babies in this kind of arrangements, and he asked if I trusted him. I told him yes, I did. I asked him the same and he said yes. 

But when I was leaving the hotel that day, something happened I guess because of my stupid curiosity. I asked under which name was the reservation made. The receptionist gave me just a name Q. I simply thought that X was his second name to protect his identity. I later Googled the name Q along with the company I suspected he worked for. I found out on the first try that his real name is actually Z Q, not X Y. Everything about his professional life matched. I found his social media accounts: LinkedIn and instagram that is private.

So, here’s where I need advice: I’m new to this whole dynamic, and while I know for sure he is caring and honest, I’m wondering if I should be worried about his neediness or if I’m just overthinking. Has anyone else had a similar experience? How do I balance emotions and trust in a sugar relationship?

Now I don’t know what to do. Should I confront him about knowing his real name? He’s always been direct with me and said he doesn’t like secrets, but now I’m not sure how to handle this. On one hand, I understand why he might have lied for privacy reasons, but on the other, I don’t want this to lead to trust issues later. 

Should I bring it up or let it go and wait for him to tell me about his real self? I’m meeting him this week.


Summary: 

Hey, I’m 19 and new to sugar dating. I’ve been seeing a SD I met in September, and while he’s been respectful and caring, I recently found out he lied about his real name. I discovered this after a hotel check-in and some Googling. He’s always talked about trust, and I understand privacy is important in these arrangements, but it’s still making me uneasy. Should I confront him or let it slide?

On top of that, he’s been really needy, constantly messaging and asking if I miss him. It’s starting to feel suffocating, but I don’t know if I’m overthinking it. Anyone else dealt with this before? How do you manage boundaries and trust in a sugar relationship?",1,1729511175.0,sugarlifestyleforum,9,0.66,False

1g8nmtz,https://www.reddit.com/r/groomingvictim/comments/1g8nmtz/was_my_therapist_grooming_me/,Was my therapist grooming me?,"Lengthy post!
Back when I was a teen, I was dealing with some difficult private situations which resulted in low feelings of self worth so I decided to go to a therapist.
Turns out, nothing's really wrong, I just was experiencing difficult people and that combined with being ""highly intelligent"", as he put it, it's normal I had started to question myself. 

At first I was hesitant, but he seemed to genuinely listen to me and quite often, even fascinated by what I was saying. I felt like he was putting me on a pedestal and really enjoyed talking to me (maybe because my chosen career path is something he admires, I felt slightly idealised). I quickly learned what he wanted to hear from me, it's something I've done unconsciously my whole life in order to survive. I kept going to him because still, I could talk to him more honestly than with others. 
Fast forward, I moved out from home and quit sessions with him but he told me we could continue to talk on the phone because ""he doesn't have anyone he can talk to the way he can with me"". But he said he didn't mean it in any romantic way. 
I believed him and sometimes phoned him up when I felt horrible. 

Noteworthy: there's been a romantic interest in my life and when I told him about signs that made me believe my romantic interest also was interested in me, he brushed it off and told me I was imagining it. Turns out I was right because afterwards, it became very clear that I was and it would have been good if it had been possible to talk objectively about it. Wasn't. He never seemed to take that into account.

After some time, I felt better and decided to thank him for his help, but to tell him that I would be good on my own now. He didn't get paid for the private phone calls and I felt bad for it, also I felt like I didn't need or want his help anymore. I was trying to be very polite and friendly but he still took it very badly and was offended, almost rude. I didn't get why.

Because something complicated happened years later, I really needed someone to talk to and turned to him (still saw him as a father figure). It was all fine and he seemed pleased to hear from me again and told me it was a sign I trusted him, then said we could meet in person when I'm town, talk about it over coffee. 
I found it surprising but told myself it would help me cultivate a more relaxed relationship with men in general. He paid for it which I didn't want to reject because it would have been rude, nothing else happened. Except that the atmosphere was more personal than expected and he started to refer to him and me as ""friends"". He clearly wanted to make us meeting up over coffee a regular thing but I was in town only for a few days anyway.

What he continuously told me over the years was that older men romantically and sexually desiring younger women was nothing bad or to be ashamed of, that my mother was a jealous, bad person and responsible for most of my issues (this worsened my relationship to her back then), he made me some kind of special person because of what I do and feel, and he said the feminist movement was horrible and ruining men's lives. Repeatedly told me how smart and special I was, seemed very personally involved in what I was telling him, telling me personal things about himself and mentioned sexuality (nothing explicit) as if it was normal. Leaning towards religion = bad, feminism = bad etc. 

The last he did was to flat-out tell me my interest wasn't seriously interested in me which, again, I found odd, because I hadn't asked him for his opinion on that specifically and he doesn't even have all of the info. 
He then politely accused me of behaving like a mademoiselle of the 18th century, collecting men who court her but not showing interest in any of them. That felt very uncomfortable because I don't want to have to defend myself on why I'm not interested in every man who shows interest in me. 

I never wanted to believe he'd overstep any boundaries but still I have to ask myself now : what was this?

#Picks Of The Week (by u/lefuniname)


####**1. High Contrast - Restoration [Highly Contrasting]**  
*Recommended if you like: Technimatic, London Elektricity, LSB*  

In a scene that usually involves spending a considerable amount of time in sweaty clubs and sensory-overloading festivals just to pay rent, it only makes sense that a lot of artists eventually find their peace in different creative endeavours. All the more lovely is it then, when massively influential, straight-up _legendary_ acts stay true to their roots like _Lincoln J. Barrett_, aka **High Contrast**, has, even after almost 25 years of DnBeauties. As a big fan of the afro'd art afiniado, I actually intended to do a proper spotlight thread for his newest long player **Restoration**, but the universe had different plans this time around, so a condensed version will have to do. Well, relative to the full, wall-of-text treatment at least. So let's dive in! 

**Hometown Glory**

Born in 1979 in the Welsh town of Penarth, near Cardiff, Lincoln J. Barrett, the son of Shakin' Stevens manager _Paul ""Legs"" Barrett_ and Southern Cardiff Welsh assembly member _Lorraine Barrett_ and brother of Satellite City's _Shelley Barrett_, showed his teenage rebellious ways by simply... not caring much about music at all, really. Sure, he played piano for a good 10 years as kid, but music truly was _not_ everything back then. In fact, he proudly tells the story of how he never even listened to _the radio_ until he was 16! During multiple illnesses plagueing him in his childhood, he instead took to the visual arts, more specifically old horror flicks. Either at home, or at the Chapter in Canton, young Lincoln managed to rack up to 300 to 400 (!!) films a year, falling in love with the soundtracks of Wendy Carlos, Vangelis, Ennio Morricone and Bernard Herrmann. He even made some home movies with his dad! However, when it came time to expand on this passion, the lack of control when working with so many people did start to frustrate him, so when he eventually discovered the art of sampling, he jumped straight into a new obsession: music! 

At first, it was Hip-Hop that took over his heart, but thanks to his sister ignoring Lincoln's wish for the then-new Method Man album and coming back home with Goldie's _Timeless_ instead, 20th Century Jungle and DnB in general followed suit not too long after. Soon enough, it was all he could think about. As the number of watched movies dropped down to a mere 5-6, he instead constantly listened to the pirate radio station _Bass FM_, went record shopping at _Kelly’s Records_ in Cardiff, and even started MCing! At first for a punk-metal band called _187_, and later even for the likes of _Fabio & Grooverider_ under the name of _Mondo Kane_, which was also his DJ name at the time. Influenced by sampler maestro _DJ Premier_, and equipped with the demo version of Cubase that came along with a magazine, young Lincoln also simply could not be _stopped_ in his very own music making endeavours. Whether it was his mom's Motown CD box set, his dad's 50s rock records, or, of course, one of his many beloved movies, nothing was safe from his sampling. 

While he was studying media / film making in Newport, mostly because ""drum and bass"" was not available as a course, he started working at Cardiff's ""only dance music shop"" - the _Catapult_ record shop. Not only was he playing out his creations at the store regularly, Lincoln was also shelling Jungle here and there, cutting his teeth at the _Neuropol_ events he and his friends _Droneboy_ (of Concrete Junglist) and Gareth organised, while still MCing here and there. One fateful day, when London Elektricity (both of them) were in town to play at the legendary _Clwb Ifor Bach_, he even asked them to MC for them - I quote: _""no""_. However, they _did_ get on well and came over to visit him at Catapult the following day, where Lincoln showed them what he had been working on. Like a lot of people at the time, he was still trying to ""rip-off Bad Company"" at first, but after being exposed to the various other electronic genres at Catapult, he instead wanted to merge the sounds of deep house, Roy Davis Jr and even disco with the DnB he loved so dearly. A more ""feminine"" sound as he called it back then, in contrast to the dark, moody, ""masculine"" Neuro sound that was so prevalent back then - hence the name, **High Contrast**. While unconventional, and with a BPM set to _too high_, the duo liked what they heard and signed him on immediately. Just as he graduated!

**The Return To The Tobacco Road Of The Forever Voyaging Mind**

I already let out a ton of fun tidbits, but fair warning, _this_ is the part I'll have to actually race through to fit this format. In a Green way. Any remaining Questions will be answered another time!

As one of the earliest signings of _Hospital Records_, his sample-heavy, straight-up lovely creations were crucial in shaping the early _""Hospital sound""_, and after a couple of singles, with _Make It Tonight_ being an early highlight, it was _Return Of Forever_ in 2002 that became a proper turning point for everyone involved. Later that year, his first ever _album_, _True Colours_, launched at Catapult (heh) and named after his mild synesthesia, took the scene by storm, his remix obsession started, and the Welsh Music Awards heaped some nominations onto him, but that still was only the beginning! One instant classic after the other, like _Mr. Majestic_ with _Calibre_, _Days Go By_, or _The Basement Track_, massive remixes for legends like _Omni Trio_ and _Roni Size_, and huge names like _Adele_, _Imogen Heap_, _Missy Elliot_, _The White Stripes_, _Eric Prydz_ and, like, genuinely too many to name, and of course, his main focus: the albums.

After his aforementioned debut effort, **High Society** was his attempt at commentary on the British class system, which he admits limited him so much that he ditched the concept later on, but still ended up working out so well it became 2004's most successful DnB album in the UK. Learning from this experience, Lincoln ditched the ""concept first"" approach and went ""music first"" for a while, the result of which he pulled together on his heavily film noir inspired **Tough Guys Don't Dance** in 2007. Not only was he able to pull off samples he had been wanting to use for a _decade_, he also went all-in on the complexity of it all, focusing more on narrative surprises and a tune's evolution over time. Technically, there was also his best-of album **Confidential** in 2009, but the real big next thing came in 2012. After so many long players under his belt, he went back to intentionally limiting himself in his productions to get the creative juices flowing: no samples, more songwriting and a film-esque structure (with him even directing the music videos!) - the result being **The Agony and the Ecstasy**!

Running out of space already, so even more condensed: He worked with _Underworld_ on the actual 2012 London Olympics, mixing and sequencing the music for the athlete's parade (and released a companion album of reworked HC tunes alongside it); toured the world; signed on with 3Beat; debuted his first-ever live show in 2016; produced _Underworld_'s _Barbara, Barbara, We Face A Shining Future_; became part of _Trainspotting 2_'s official soundtrack; went back to sampling action on his **Night Gallery** LP in 2017; had _Unglued_ deliver an absolutely insane remix of If We Ever; creatively explored the underground, 90s, jungle ways of doing things with his 2020 album **Notes From The Underground**; remixed, like, everyone; and started his very own label, **Highly Contrasting**. Which brings us to this _seventh_, or if you count all the variations, _ninth_, album of his, a return to the classic 2000s High Contrast Liquid Funk sound full of Soul, Funk, Disco and Jazz samples: **Restoration**!

**Restoration**

After obliterating all of the above paragraphs with his opening statement intro **Overture**, Lincoln launches into the fun with his _guess who's back_ style opener **Remember Me**. Strings galore, 2010s wubs, lovely synth flurries, paired with a sample of Marlena Shaw's _Woman Of The Ghetto_, famously sampled and resampled into a ton of 90s dance tracks (like _Blue Boy - Remember Me_) and resung by _Sharlene Hector_ on this particular rendition - classic High Contrast is back, baby! Don't believe me? Well, next we've got reel-idea-turned-tune **Be No Rain**, which just _oozes_ summery vibes with its wide assortment of soulful samples, from all sorts of pianos and even some saxiness to the titular vocal sample, assembled on his trusty S2400 sampler. Still not convinced? Well, how about **Lord**, a reimagination of Bob James' _Dream Journey_, famously previously sampled in Technimatic's _Night Vision_, all spliced together with passionate oh's, screams, strings, wind chimes and harps, evolving throughout!

Or how about **Happy People**, stuffed full of most _lovely_ soul samples, from the various, uplifting vocals to the incredibly catchy guitar riff fading in and out throughout! Or how about the absolutely _gorgeous_ **Realise**, whose wonderful, melancholically beautiful, early Fred V & Grafix-esque synths _will_ pluck at your heartstrings while going through all sorts of evolutions, while a lethal (for your heart) vocal sample and bass whomps fill out the blanks. Right as you might think Lincoln has already reached peak sample action, he then hits us with the wildly chopped-up arrangement of **It's Alright**, which is simply _bursting_ with creatively assembled and reassembled vocal chops, trumpets making all sorts of amazing appearances, a middle section that most definitely works, and just heaps upon heaps of pure vibes. My favourite probably. Of course, we're only barely past the halfway mark yet, so we roll on with even more classic vibes, on **Loved You So**, which contrasts the janky, weird noises making £20 organ he bought at an old market and the classic soul sample, with some grade A gritty bass wobbles. Might sound simple, but you know damn well that Lincoln _thrives_ on these sorts of combinations, and of course the end result is fantastic!

Home stretch now. Triumphantly trumpeting, we continue the wobbly bass action with the orchestral **On Bass**, with each arrangement part weaving in and out on the wonderful announcer's cue. **No Words**' impeccable, even more audio crackling than usual vibes, combined with the heartbreaking vocal sample, really don't need more of my unnecessary descriptors. Penultimate stop **Patience**'s dramatic, ever-evolving string back-and-forth, paired with yet another great vocal sample on top of some truly head-nod-inducing drums, takes us on one last ride, before we reach the finale, and title track, **Restoration**. Seemingly a, well, _restoration_ of his long-forgotten unreleased tune of the same name, but, from what I can tell, having lived through so many iterations that the end result is on a whole 'nother level - excellent pianos, string loveliness, a whole bunch of soulful vocals working in tandem, all the greats really. What makes this one special for me are all the vocal sample touches making us aware of the finality of it all: thanking us, the listeners, for our time, and ending the whole experience with a mere _""that'll do""_. I love it.

### Conclusion

Albums by Alix Perez, Zar, BCee, Redeyes - liquid lovers are truly living in great times right now. However, no one can capture that early 2000s Liquid Funk vibe quite like the legendary maestro Lincoln J. Barrett himself. Not only is every single tune exuding that special nostalgic magic that can only come from the steady sampling hand of monsieur Contrast, Lincoln has also wrapped it all into such a delightful packaging with his incredibly high effort promotional strategy, that you can't help but fall in love with it all. Seriously, everything from the watercolour artworks, digitally ripped up for maximum contrast, to the behind-the-scenes videos, full of sampler action, corded telephones and his very own doppelgänger, is simply astonishingly well made. High Contrastonishing, even. I only wish I was good at sample spotting, because there is _so much_ to unpack here that I feel I'm missing out on. I _need_ one of those sampling breakdown videos for each and every single tune!

Absolutely excellent in every single way, a true joyride through Lincoln's imagination, sparkling with retro sampling magic at every corner. I love it so much.

I thought about sharing the website that was given to me, the guy when putting through a request through it actually turned up quickly and was actively with me on whatsapp sharing places he finds which gave me a sense of option and that was surprising to me.

Backstory a bit he was an agent in rent agencies he told me and kept a large network of contacts that helps him find free places ready for rent

P.S: he never specifically told me a price for his services but I will be honest by saying he was extremely fair and very understanding of my situation, I managed to pay him around 800 and he was more than happy with it (helped me for 3 weeks) I had to turn down some places that had too many occupants and ended up in a studio with a fair price considering Dublin.

I had sent a submission through his contact us and then got back to me the next day with a phone call, introducing himself, asking for what i’m looking for and if i’m okay with roomates as that would provide quicker results, asked about my budget, the next 3 days we sat down for a coffee showing me what he has as options and had to narrow down some more requirements which he was okay to pull back and find other locations, the rest of communication was through whatsapp and as an international graduate, of course the rent that he found me was with a contract signed by both parties for security.

Anyways that was my experience and being in a situation before where finding a stable rent situation was crucial and critical, I would’ve loved to stumble upon this earlier but anyhoos here is the web page link:

Coffee spout rinses and makes coffee absolutely fine, but no milk comes out of the milk spout. 

I never use the water spout except for descaling but tried it and that worked fine. But when descaling the next day the water spout is now not working and resulted in a puddle of water during descaling so I had to turn off the machine mid-descale. 

Now I'm left with a partly descaled machine so l won't be using it to make coffee as I'm worried about any descaling solution still being in there.

For context I work as a virtual assistant through an agency and have had the same client for 3 years. My first plan was to stay until our lay-offs next March.

This year though, there's been a lot of shifts in our workflow, and I think I made the mistake of overestimating my ability to adapt.

Personally I've been dealing with health (physical and mental) problems with myself and my family, as well as a breakup, the death of a family member and some friends. I realize now I was never in a proper headspace because I never allowed myself to rest emotionally.

Nung nandun ako sa lamay ng tita ko at kaibigan ko, pinagiisipan ko trabaho. Nung kausap ko yung stepdad ko at tito ko after they had emergency surgery, pinagiisipan ko trabaho. Nung naghiwalay kami ng girlfriend ko, pinagiisipan ko trabaho. Add to this pa, my wallet was stolen about a week ago, and even while talking with police and barangay, pinagiisipan ko pa trabaho ko.

Now, at work for the past few months, I've been getting in trouble recently. Important emails slipping me by, performance going down, getting call outs, etc etc etc. At this point I wouldnt be surprised if I get suspended or something. It feels like the perfect performance of 3 years have been forgotten in the exhaustion of a quarter.

I think the gravity of all the internal exhaustion is crashing down. I've been feeling change-averse. Anything work related has been giving me feelings of anxiety and nervousness, and I begin to breathe hard, and I have to hold onto something to support myself. Nag-breakdown pa ako sa Coffee Bean & Tea Leaf when I was catching up with a friend and I told her what's happened the past few months. Sometimes, it takes effort to do anything, like eat or even things I used to look forward to doing. I've been told I lost a lot of weight na din. I feel perpetually cold inside, like I have ice in my lungs. There were a couple of points where I cried 5 times a week.

I don't want to leave my job, but I'm making my expectations flexible na if I have to. People outside work have been telling me that I look and sound sad, even through chat. Sobrang halata pala yung effect sa akin.

Para sa inyo, for those who experienced burnout - what was it like? How did you cope? I'm looking forward to any and all advice, or even stories to share.",1,1729510584.0,adultingph,0,1.0,False

1g8nhya,https://www.reddit.com/r/chubbytravel/comments/1g8nhya/trip_report_dromoland_castle_killarney_park/,TRIP REPORT: Dromoland Castle + Killarney Park + Greenmount House ,"9 nights total, mid October. Traveled with wife, daughter, and in-laws.

Two rooms at each accommodation:

* 3 nights Dingle Greenmount House
* 3 nights Killarney Park Hotel
* 3 nights Dromoland Castle

Booked the Killarney Park and Dromoland with our TA, Liz Squillante, at [SpringboardTravel.com](http://SpringboardTravel.com)

Liz is always proactive, super responsive, and overall really great to work with!

# 3 nights Greenmount House in Dingle

TL:DR: Charming, comfortable rooms with panoramic bay views, modern bathrooms, and a top-notch breakfast made this the best value of the trip at just $210/night per room. Impeccable service and cozy vibes made it feel like a hidden gem.

**The accommodations:**

* Sea View rooms, each with a King bed + two sofas + walk-out patio with french doors and panoramic vistas over the bay and pastures
* These were the best rooms they offered and only $210 per night per room

**The good:**

* Incredible views of the bay and pastures from the sitting areas and breakfast room
* Extremely comfortable and quaint accommodations
* Breakfast was A+ (small buffet + menu options)
* Recently updated bathrooms with heated tile floors, not especially lux, but what I would consider quite nice — and definitely up to standard
* Beds and bed linens were extremely comfortable
* Daily housekeeping service was on point with nightly turndown

**Overall impression:**

* For $210 a night it’s the highest dollar-for-dollar value I’ve ever gotten in a hotel stay. If they charged $400+ a night, I wouldn’t blink.
* Can’t imagine better accommodations if you’re in Dingle

# 3 nights Killarney Park Hotel

TL;DR Exceptional service, spacious suites, and delicious food created a flawless experience, despite some minor bedding issues. The cozy, family-friendly amenities and warm, welcoming staff make this a must-stay when in Killarney.

**The accommodations:**

* We got the Kenmare Suite ($646/night) with King bed + Queen bed + extra living area with seating and fireplace + extra half bathroom
* Kenmare suite is huge, and can only be accessed via staircase at the end of a long hallway
* It’s right next door to the Mangerton Suite
* If you’re booking this place with a large family, I would definitely book these two suites together for tons of space and max privacy
* In-laws got a very spacious premium guest room. It was an accessible room, so very large bathroom.
* Their room had an outdoor terrace, small dining table, sofa and fireplace. They loved it. And I think it was a great value for what we paid ($482/night).
* Rooms are exquisitely designed with plaid carpeting and wallpaper. Very Ireland. Very cozy. Perfect decor.
* Main bathroom was spacious, with large shower, tub and two pedestal sinks. I wouldn’t say that the bathrooms were outdated, because the vibe was definitely in keeping with the overall aesthetic, but the bathrooms could’ve been a little nicer.
* So it’s no surprise the property plans to close for several months this winter for full refurbishment and to specifically to modernize all the bathrooms
* When completed these rooms are going to be genuinely incredible

**The good:**

* Received welcome amenities with note from manager in each room. It was a really nice touch, especially since we didn’t book the virtuoso rate. (We booked a midweek saver rate at a considerable discount with breakfast included)
* Breakfast each morning was borderline spectacular. Everything beyond delicious. Huge tower tray with croissants, biscuits, fruit, and smoothies. Anything we tried from the menu was excellent.
* It was definitely the best breakfast we had on the trip
* In fact, almost anything we ate on property was excellent. Zero complaints with the food, all very good.
* Father in law used the gym, said it was great
* We all went swimming in the heated indoor pool, used the indoor and outdoor jacuzzi. Outdoor jacuzzi was A+
* They have a small zero entry pool for toddlers. My daughter loved it.
* MIL and wife each enjoyed spa treatments. Said it was really nice, but nothing especially memorable.
* The service here was just so top-notch. Super prompt. Not pretentious or stuffy, just very precise, proactive, paid attention to the little things.
* Extremely friendly too. I mean, literally just the kindest group of people. Many of whom have been working at the property forever — and treat it like their home. Staff were constantly dusting surfaces and cleaning. You could just tell everyone takes such pride in the property. And they should. Because it’s amazing.
* We ordered room service several times, including cocktails and beers, and each time it was so fast and the presentation so well done. Love love love that.
* Daily housekeeping also on point. Turndown service so sweet: Each day they arranged our daughter’s stuffed toys in different places in the room.
* We took a jaunting car to Ross Castle and they packed us the cutest lunch for our daughter, peanut butter and banana sandwiches.
* We planned how to get to Ross Castle, but forgot to plan how to get back. Called concierge who found us a van with a child seat. A+ rescue there.
* Each night the bartenders gave me lots of insight into Irish whiskeys. And I tried so many of them. A very knowledgeable and engaging bar staff.

**The not-so-good:**

* King bed was comfortable, queen bed not so much. Different mattresses side by side. Queen much firmer, felt cheaper.
* If I only had one complaint, I’d say the bed linens could be more comfortable. They were either scratchy (or maybe allergens?) because my daughter woke up each morning with visible red cheeks clearly from irritation.
* Also no top sheets, only duvet. So sometimes hard to regulate body temp.
* Overall bedding was my least favorite of the trip, but my MIL said the mattress was her favorite.
* Possibly lots of different mattresses in different rooms?

**Overall impression:**

* From the time we arrived to the time we left, everything was exactly as you want. Nothing will necessarily blow you away. But it was literally perfect nonetheless.
* Highly recommend. And will definitely be back.

# Dromoland Castle

* Booked 3rd night free virtuoso promo rate
* Worked out to $1,000/night per stateroom

TL;DR A magical castle experience with thoughtful staff touches and beautiful common areas, though room quality can vary. While housekeeping missed the mark, the overall experience felt special, especially for families.

**The accommodations:**

* We booked two standard staterooms.
* The in-laws room was … GORGEOUS! Everything you imagine a castle stay would be: Towering 20-foot ceilings, tasteful chandelier, dramatic windows, letting in tons of natural night. I love this room. Spectacular.
* By contrast, our room in the same category, was … fine. It’s spacious enough, but dark walls make it feel cramped, windows are small, ceilings avg height maybe 8 feet. No chandelier. Nothing like the in-laws room. And nothing like staying in a castle. You could find this room at virtually any luxury hotel.
* The attached pics don't quite capture the huge difference in 'feeling' of the two rooms.
* It's just a little odd for two wildly different rooms to be in the same category at the same price. In fact, I thought for sure the in-laws must’ve been upgraded. But I guess it makes sense if you just go by layout and sqf.
* Also seeing both rooms side by side really punctuated the difference in a way it might not have it we had only gotten our room. Though I'm confident I still would've been a little underwhelmed.
* A few months prior to our stay I called reservations to try to learn more about room options, and the reservationist said that the staterooms would be much like the room my in-laws got. Tall ceilings. Chandelier. Etc. But obviously not all staterooms bring this charm.
* It’s really hard to get detail on the rooms on the website. Their marketing is limited and not good. And they sorta hide behind the the fact that “every room is unique.” So you don’t know what you’re going to get. The opacity and ambiguity is frustrating, to say the least.
* To be fair, my TA offered to advocate on our behalf for a better room. But it’s not like our room was straight up bad per se. And we had already unpacked and didn’t want the hassle.
* Bathrooms in both rooms were pretty standard. We had a nice walk-in shower with rainfall shower head, marginal water pressure. Nothing stands out.

**The good:**

* On arrival several of the staff lined up in front of the entrance to personally greet us. This is something they arranged with my TA (thank you, Liz!). Then they ushered us inside to a private room to enjoy complimentary champagne. Can’t imagine a more fun or memorable welcome! At the airport, everyone in our group named their favorite part of the trip. My MIL said the Dromoland welcome was her favorite part of the entire trip. It was genuinely very special. Big kudos to the team for making it happen!
* Another very nice touch: They put a photo of our family in a picture frame in each of the rooms. Just a truly wonderful personal touch that I’ve never seen before. And the in-laws loved it.
* Throughout our stay so many of the staff greeted my daughter by her first name. So I thought that was pretty special and thoughtful. They also took extra care to make sure she had the cereal she wanted and little snack boxes. Can’t say enough about how much effort they took to make her stay feel comfortable and special. And I sincerely appreciate it.
* The common areas are also wonderful and everything you’d expect from a castle. It felt old world and grand and elegant and we absolutely adored just hanging by the huge fire places. The bar staff would bring us drinks and we’d play cards — and we loved every moment.
* On that note, bar staff was very awesome and even knew how to make a Wisconsin Old Fashioned. Impressive! Cocktails were consistently excellent.
* Ate dinner the first two nights at the Fig, their restaurant on the golf course. Both nights we ordered so many different dishes and everything was truly excellent. It’s super rare to eat so much of the menu and love everything. So Fig was a highlight for sure.
* We did high tea as well, which was also exquisite. The sandwiches were killer. Scones the best we’ve ever had. Everyone loved everything here too. So kudos on the tea service for sure. Better than expected.
* Turndown service was really nice too. Love when hotels do the little floor mats by the bed and lay out slippers. They also left little notes on the bed. All really nice there.

**The not so good:**

* Breakfast: Pretty underwhelming! Breakfast buffet right on par with what you might expect at a decent Westin Club Lounge. Or any basic hotel throughout Europe.
* From the menu I ordered pancakes, which were legit inedible. The eggs Benedict muffin was burnt. By far Dromoland delivering the worst breakfast out of all three places we stayed.
* We had plans to do a tasting menu dinner in the main dining room on the last night. But cancelled because we just didn’t trust the kitchen.
* One thing is this property seems to regularly traffic large groups in and out. There were two consecutive groups associated with Edward Jones — like part of an award trip for their top producers? So all around there were whiteboards and conference style tables welcoming attendees and ushering them to large events. Definitely felt out of step with the vibe But I guess that’s what you see in Western Ireland.
* The surrounding property is mostly a golf course. I sorta expected more hiking or walking trails, but there’s only one smaller walking trail near the property.
* Housekeeping was also a big miss. Like, objective bad. Many luxury hotels will kinda make things neat and tidy, organize toiletries on a towel on the vanity, etc. Not here. They left used coffee mugs and cups and water bottles and trash around. Left my daughter’s bathrobe just strewn on the back of the sofa. Honestly, besides making the bed and refreshing towels you would hardly notice housekeeping had been there.
* One of the days my in-laws were gone for five hours and they didn’t service the room at all.
* Also one day after housekeeping had already come and “serviced” the room, my daughter and I were napping and someone used a key card to enter the room without knocking. I said “hello?” They didn’t identify themselves or say pardon or my apologies. Just closed the door and left. Wild stuff.
* At another point they left like huge wax streaks on the brass door handles going into the in-laws room. I showed one of the managers who happened to have been walking by. I told him overall how disappointing housekeeping had been. I mean, on its own, the wax thing is no big deal. Just an oversight. But it was illustrative of the rest of our experience, reflecting either a lack of attention to detail or that the staff is simply stretched too thin trying to turn a bunch of rooms for these big groups.
* Later another manager profusely apologized for the poor housekeeping and bought my family a round of drinks. They also offered a concession on our final room rate when we checked out.
* I will say I appreciated how contrite the team was and how much effort they took to try to make it right.

**Overall impression:**

* A pretty mixed bag, to be honest. Our room obviously annoyed me. Breakfast not good. Housekeeping bad.
* But the property is truly special. We loved looking at the castle while walking around. At night the scenes are positively transcendent. (Those pics are unedited iphone images with 3-second exposure).
* Would we come back? Maybe! Probably?
* But if you come, make sure your TA is aggressively deliberate about securing you the right room, regardless of category. Or maybe just choose a base room and bring zero expectations. Also expect mediocre, Marriott-style housekeeping.
* But even with all that, the experience was genuinely magical, especially with a little kid running around, and that made it all worth it.

My eyes blinked open to the soft, pale glow of the morning light filtering through the curtains. I lay still, my body sunken into the familiar dip on my side of the bed, the weight of sleep lingering in my limbs. The silence was comforting, and I reached across the mattress, expecting to feel the warmth of my wife beside me.

Her side was empty.

I frowned, my fingers brushing the cold, undisturbed sheets. Lisa never woke before me on her days off. I pushed the thought aside, trying to shake off the lingering fog of sleep. Maybe she’d gone to the bathroom or been called into the ER last minute. They were always short-staffed these days.

I glanced at the old wooden clock hanging above the dresser.

6:17 AM.

Too early for Lisa. My stomach knotted with unease, but I told myself not to worry yet. Maybe she was downstairs, making breakfast. I sat up, rubbing my eyes, and was greeted by Middow, our cat. He wove between my legs, his purring loud and insistent. I reached down to stroke him absentmindedly before stumbling into the bathroom, the chill of the house creeping into my skin.

The stillness of the house unnerved me as I splashed cold water on my face. The only sound was the soft hum of the heater kicking on, filling the empty spaces with a mechanical, distant drone. I pulled on my housecoat and headed down the dimly lit hallway, Middow at my heels.

Coffee first. 

The thought was comforting—routine. I moved toward the kitchen, but something stopped me.

Middow’s bowl was empty. Strange. Lisa was always the first to feed him in the mornings. A flicker of confusion passed through me, and my gaze fell on her purse, hanging from the back of the kitchen chair. Her car keys were still on the rack by the front door.

A sense of unease prickled at the back of my neck. I crossed the room to the living room window, brushing aside the heavy curtains. The landscape outside was barren under the pale winter sky, the frost glistening in the early morning light. Lisa’s car sat in the driveway, untouched.

“Babe? You home?” I called, my voice sounding hollow in the stillness.

No answer.

I fed Middow, his purring louder than ever, as the coffee maker began its slow drip. I waited, tapping my fingers against the counter, trying to shake the creeping dread building in my chest. Something was off. I grabbed my phone from the bedroom, hoping for a message. Nothing. I hit the call button, but my heart sank when I heard her ringtone—a familiar melody vibrating from her nightstand.

She hadn’t taken her phone.

Now the worry set in, sharp and sudden. I threw on yesterday’s clothes, my fingers fumbling as I laced up my shoes, and stepped outside. The cold air hit me like a slap, biting through my thin layers. The house stood alone on the outskirts of town, fields and forest stretching for miles. There was no movement—no sound but the whistle of the wind through the trees.

Then I saw her.

Lisa stood at the far edge of the property, just before the dark line of trees that bordered our land. She was still in her pajamas, her thin silk nightgown a stark contrast to the frozen landscape. Her back was to the forest, facing me, unmoving.

“Lisa?” I called, my voice quivering slightly. “What are you doing? It’s freezing out here!”

She didn’t move. She didn’t respond.

I took a few steps toward her, my heart pounding harder with each one. A strange sense of dread clawed at my chest.

As I approached, she began to move—backward. She was still facing me, but her steps were slow, deliberate, retreating into the shadows of the forest. The trees seemed to swallow her whole.

“Lisa!” I yelled, breaking into a run. “Wait! Stop!”

She disappeared into the trees.

I stopped at the edge of the forest, the towering pines looming overhead, casting long, dark shadows across the frozen ground. The cold felt sharper here, biting deeper, as if the forest itself was colder than the rest of the world.

I hesitated, my breath clouding the air in front of me. Everything about this was wrong. Lisa hated the cold. She wouldn’t wander into the woods in a nightgown, not in this weather.

I took a deep breath and stepped forward, crossing the threshold into the trees.

The world changed instantly. The sounds of the wind and the distant hum of the house disappeared, replaced by an oppressive silence. My footsteps were muted on the frozen ground, the air thick with an eerie stillness.

“Lisa?” I called, my voice small in the vastness of the woods.

No answer. The trees crowded in on me, their dark branches like twisted fingers reaching toward the sky. I moved deeper, my eyes straining to see through the thick underbrush. Every shadow seemed to shift, every tree standing like a silent, watching sentinel. The cold bit through my clothes, but I pressed on, my pulse quickening with each step.

Then I heard it—a voice, soft and distant, carried on the wind.

“…Edgarrrr…”

I froze. It was Lisa’s voice, but something about it was wrong. Too delicate. Too close.

“Lisa?” I called, spinning around. “Where are you?”

The silence pressed in, thick and suffocating. Then, once again, the voice came.

“…Edgar, this waaay…”

The voice echoed from deeper in the woods, sending a shiver down my spine. Without thinking, I ran toward it, the panic now fully taking hold. Branches whipped at my face, roots seemed to rise up from the ground, snagging my feet and tearing at my clothes. The cold air burned in my lungs as I stumbled through the forest.

Finally, I broke through the trees into a large clearing. The ground was frozen, barren, and lifeless, the trees forming a circle around me like towering sentinels. At the far edge of the clearing, I saw her—Lisa. She was hunched over, her back to me, her nightgown streaked with dirt and blood. Her shoulders shook with soft, pitiful sobs.

“Lisa?” My voice cracked, tears of relief welling in my eyes.

Before I could take a step, my phone buzzed violently in my pocket. Startled, I pulled it out and glanced at the screen.

It was Lisa’s number.

A cold wave of confusion and dread crashed over me. I looked from the phone to the figure in the clearing, my heart pounding in my ears.

With a shaking hand, I answered. “H-Hello?”

“Edgar?” Lisa’s voice came through, frantic and full of fear. “Where are you? I’ve been trying to call you for hours!”

My throat tightened. “What? I’m… I’m in the woods. Where are you?”

“I’m at home!” she cried. “I went out for breakfast with Lacey, and when I came back, you were gone! I’ve been calling and calling!”

I stared at the figure in the clearing, still sobbing, still covered in blood.

My mind reeled as I struggled to make sense of what was happening. “Lisa… if you’re home… then who…?”

The line cut out, the phone in my hand going dead as the battery drained in an instant. I stared at the dark screen, a cold sweat breaking out across my skin.

The sobbing stopped, but was replaced with a soft, creeping giggle.

Her arms hung at strange angles, twisted and contorted unnaturally. She took a step backwards towards me, then another, her body jerking and spasming with each movement.

“Run,” she whispered, her voice no longer human.

I didn’t wait. I turned and ran, my feet barely touching the ground as I tore through the forest. The laughter echoed behind me, growing louder and more hysterical, a sound that chilled me to my very core. My heart pounded, my breath came in ragged gasps, and still, I ran, faster than I ever thought possible.

Branches lashed at me, roots tripped me, but I didn’t stop. I could hear her—no, it—closing in, its twisted limbs crashing through the underbrush, its laughter ringing in my ears.

Finally, the edge of the woods came into view. I threw myself through the trees and collapsed onto the frozen grass, gasping for air.

When I opened my eyes, I was surrounded by paramedics, friends, and Lisa. The real Lisa. She was holding my head in her lap, her face streaked with tears.

They told me I’d been missing for six hours.

I said nothing. I couldn’t explain what had happened. No one would believe me if I tried. So I told them I didn’t remember anything after making coffee that morning.

But I know what I saw.

They kept me in the hospital for a few days, running tests and scans of my brain to make sure my “breakdown” wasn’t related to something serious. 

When the tests came back clear, I was prescribed some medication and ordered to see a psychiatrist once a month for three months. And then they sent me home with a note granting me one month of paid leave from work.

Lisa took a couple of weeks off of work to stay with me. She never left my side. Wherever I was, she was. Admittedly, it was hard looking at her the same way after what happened. I felt paranoid, uneasy. Terrified that whatever chased me through the woods was still out there, just waiting for me to come back.

Or maybe it would come for me in the night.

I hardly sleep anymore. I spend my nights listening to the ticking clock above the dresser while who I think is Lisa sleeps soundly next to me.

A few days ago, I was in the basement doing the laundry. It’s a chore that both Lisa and I tend to procrastinate on. I pulled out an armful of dirty clothes from the overflowing laundry basket and stuffed them into the washer. 

I looked back into the basket and froze. In the bottom of the basket was Lisa’s nightgown—the same one that thing had been wearing in the woods. An awful feeling blanketed over me as flashbacks filled my head.

It became worse when I reached in and pulled it out.

Her nightgown was tattered and torn, stained with dirt and dried blood.",1,1729510130.0,nosleep,1,1.0,False

# SEPT. 21st, 2024 ~US Senate passes Lankford’s bill aimed against Red China’s critical minerals

# [US Senate passes Lankford’s bill aimed against Red China’s critical minerals - Oklahoma Energy Today (okenergytoday.com)](https://www.okenergytoday.com/2024/09/us-senate-passes-lankfords-bill-aimed-against-red-chinas-critical-minerals/)

The U.S. Senate passed legislation authored by Senators James Lankford (R-OK), Gary Peters (D-MI), and Mitt Romney (R-UT) to reduce American reliance on China and other adversarial nations for critical minerals.

“The United States should not depend on communist China to keep our critical mineral supply chain running. Relying on China for critical minerals means relying on our adversary for batteries, medical supplies, and military equipment,” said Lankford. “We need to prioritize American-produced energy solutions and give US suppliers a seat at the table.”

Critical minerals and rare earth metals are used to manufacture electric vehicle batteries, military equipment, and other technology that is vital to American economic competitiveness and homeland security. China remains the largest source for more than half of the critical minerals on the US Geological Survey’s [2022 list](https://www.usgs.gov/news/national-news-release/us-geological-survey-releases-2022-list-critical-minerals) that the United States imports, such as lithium and cobalt.

The Senators’ bill would address this threat to our manufacturing supply chains by creating an intergovernmental task force to identify opportunities to increase domestic production and recycling of critical minerals. The bill now moves to the House for consideration.

The Intergovernmental Critical Minerals Task Force Act creates a presidential task force with representatives from federal agencies who must consult with state, local, territorial, and Tribal governments to determine how to address national security risks associated with America’s critical mineral supply chains. The task force will also identify new domestic opportunities for mining, processing, refinement, reuse, and recycling of critical minerals. The legislation would also require the task force to publish a report to Congress and publish findings, guidelines, and recommendations to combat the United States’ reliance on China and other foreign nations for critical minerals.

And let me tell you something. I am, I am fucking angry. I am angry at a church which encourages young girls marrying their rapists after they get pregnant. I’m angry at the church which SUPPORTED a 23 year old man groom 13 year old me and try to turn me into a baby machine wife for when I turned 18. I’m angry at a church which is built on hatred, sexism, racism, and everything -ism. I will gladly keep being angry, because that church deserves it.

Of COURSE people will be angry. Probably 99% of us in this subreddit have so much trauma and pent up anger. It’s what leaving a cult does to you. You are angry over the life that’s been taken from you. Over the lies, the gossip, all the bullshit. The opportunities you’ve missed. 
You’re angry over the fact that you probably still feel guilty when you drink coffee and wear a tank top. Or that you need to spend money on therapy. Or that you don’t have a social circle because you’ve lost what you thought was your support network and outer family circle.

So don’t mind me while I keep being angry. Mormonism is nothing short of a serious, life-engrossing cult and leaving it is a fucking win. Some of we’re lucky enough to leave early in our lives, but some people leave after they’ve retired! Can you just imagine the feeling of betrayal and loss? Mourning what your life could have been like? I will very happily support anyone who chooses to be angry. We need a rage room, not people trying to dampen our anger. Anger and passion is what’s sometimes needed to make a change. Let’s not do what Mormonism did to us and try to control our feelings and dampen our emotions. We feel, and we are all valid.

# تاريخ قهوة محمد افندي

كانت بداية قهوة محمد افندي منذ عام 1871 حيث كان محمد افندي يساعد والده في محل تحميص وبيع القهوة وكان بعمر صغير يحضّر القهوة التركية التقليدية بأدوات يدوية بسيطة، وبذلك كانت متجر محمد أفندي أول محل يبيع البن المحمص والمطحون، بعد أن كان تباع للناس حبات البن دون تحميص، ويقومون بطحنها وتحميصها بأنفسهم في المنازل.

توفي محمد أفندي عام 1932 لكن مهنته التي ورثها عن أبيه انتقلت أيضاً إلى أولاده الذين حافظوا على أصالة طعم قهوة محمد أفندي وطوروا من طرق صنعها من خلال جلب أحدث المعدات والآلات والتجهيزات.، حتى صار يقصد الناس من كل أنحاء العالم محلات محمد أفندي في منطقة أمينونو في إسطنبول، بالإضافة إلى تصدير القهوة إلى عشرات البلدان، وبيع الأطنان منها بشكل يومي.

الرائحة: تحمل القهوة الأصلية رائحة البن المحمص الطازج على الطريقة التركية التقليدية، بينما تفتقد القهوة المقلّدة هذه الرائحة المميزة.

الرغوة: تتميز القهوة الأصلية بأنها تمتلك رغوة تظهر على سطح الفنجان ولا تتلاشى بسرعة كبيرة كغيرها من أنواع القهوة المقلدة.

","Hey!  
I'm new to Stardew Valley and I have to admit, I'm loving it! I’ve spent my entire vacation playing the game (Also had plenty of beers with friends but we wont talk about that). I’m 22, male, currently live in Greece (EEST/UTC +3) just graduated with a degree in History, and I’m about to start my Master's in Political Science. Love hanging out, reading, listening to classic rock and I'm a huge coffee enthusiast. Besides English I can speak a bit of French. 

At first I thought there were public servers for the game, but sadly, I found out that's not the case. I'd love to play with others, so I'm open to joining an existing server or even starting one ourselves. Unfortunately, none of my friends really play Stardew Valley (they apparently can’t fully appreciate the magic of this game!). I'm an eager fisherman  and I also love making mayonnaise!

Hit me up if you want to tag along!

1g8mya6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Amsterdam/comments/1g8mya6/godtier_sweet_treat_list_in_amsterdam/,God-tier sweet treat list in Amsterdam,"I have a major sweet tooth and I keep a mental list of god-tier treats that I love in Amsterdam.

The way I sort of think about food is that if I'm going to spend my calorie budget on something unhealthy as a treat, then it would be a disservice to my health to waste those calories on something that was anything less than delicious. So when I'm going to eat something trashy it's extremely important to me that it should be the best of the best, otherwise it's not worth it.  
  
Maybe this list is worth sharing:

- The cookie at Van Stapele, yes it's flooded with tourists but the cookie does live up to the hype, it is excellent. 

- The maicena alfajores at Melly's behind Dam. Not only the best alfajores in town but as far as I can tell the only good ones.

- The frosted cinnamon bun at Britton's bakery on FeBo are the best in town, they're incredible. Light in cinnamon heavy on frosting, they are a calorie bomb for sure - not something to have often but I do treat myself perhaps a bit more often than I should. They also sell these at Liev coffee around the corner which is a nice coffee spot. 

- The vegan cinnamon rolls at Have A Roll on Van Vouw: Not as good as Britton's but they're close! Very very good and if you're vegan then it's a must-try.

- The biskvi at Scandanavian Embassy: It is very sweet even for me and my almost limitless taste for sugar, but this chocolate fondant treat is heavenly. They don't always have it sadly.

- The pistachio escargot at grammes: Perfect pastry, flaky and sweet, baked fresh every morning.

- The ice cream (gelato) at Pisa Ijs at the bottom of Scheldestraat down by the Rai. Everybody queues forever at Massimo i nthe pijp a few blocks north, and I'm not gonna rip on Massimo, it's good stuff - but for me Pisa Ijs is superior ice cream with better flavours. They have mint! Almost nowhere in town has mint ice cream for some reason, but I love it.



Everyone knows about the Van Stapele cookie and fair enough it is super good, but I think many people aren't aware of these other treats which to me deserve just as much recognition. Try them and see what you think! Do you have others to add to this?



AVOID:

- Van Wonderen Stroopwafels: complete tourist trap ripoff, got famous via tiktok but now even tiktok is rebelling against it since they started charging up to 15 euros for completely mid stroopwafels. If you want fresh stroopwafel just go to rudi's on Albrt Cuyp and get the classic for 2.50.

1g8mxuo,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1g8mxuo/my_week_so_far/,My week so far....,"Wednesday. Not heard from all day. I'm at work. I received a message pleading for my help because he's struggling with his medication. He's overdosed. Got nothing left etc. He didn't answer an hour later when I left work. I phoned 999. Ambulance arrived. Took him in. A few hours later he was allowed to go. He came to my house. It was a work night for me. I was shattered. He broke my sleep all night. 

Thursday he didn't wake up when I went to work. I checked through the morning for a message. I asked him to go get my parcel in from the doorstep. No response. I arrive home. He's in bed. He's taken my parcels in. His phones on the pillow next to him.he just didn't bother replying to me. He's sweating and tired. We eat dinner and he goes back to bed. 

Friday he wakes up. Lifeless and boring. Flat. Has bacon sandwiches and then decides he's going to go home. I send a food shop and go to my parents for a coffee. I had text him twice but no reply. So I ring. He answers. I remind him not to go to sleep as the shopping was coming. That evening he tells me he's going to get a prescription shortly. He said he will call me. Said he needed my help with them. I sat up until 10pm before I fell asleep waiting for his call or reply. I wake up at 2am and 4am. Checked my phone nothing! 

Saturday morning. I wake up at 7am and still nothing. I check WhatsApp. He was active at 1.36am. I message him to ask why he didn't get back to me or call. I get no reply until 1pm. I'm out shopping in another town. He tells me his phone froze and he had go ho over to EE who said his sim was causing it. I sense BS and listen but feel flat and annoyed at his nonsense. I text him an hour later saying I didn't feel convinced by what he had said. He didn't answer. I try call at 3.30. No answer. At 4.30pm I text and say I feel uts time to go our own separate ways. I get nothing until 10pm when he says he's been sleeping loads and he loves me. I dont reply as it feels like too little effort. 

Sunday I get a message at 1pm asking if I've fallen out with him. I said no but I felt XYZ and was unhappy. He replied saying he's ill and I keep starting! I said cam I cannot you. He didn't reply. I heard absolutely nothing from him. 

This morning at 4.30 am I wake up and feel quite shocked to have nothing from him still. I try calling and texting several times. At 9.45 he messaged this morning saying he'd just woken up. He put nothing else. I called him 4 times over 25 minutes. No answer. I text saying its clear ge doesn't want to talk to me so I'll stop ringing. He then rang me straight away. He shouted he was ill and I was making him iller. He said I just want you to leave me alone and stop accusing me of cheating. When you can't get hold of me you think I'm out cheating. I just want you to go away!!! He hung up. 

I text and said please update your daughter so she can keep an eye on you and I'm down as you NOK so perhaps you need to get your Daughter down on that aswel so I know you are being supported. Then I'm able to leave you alone. 

He hurled more abuse at me. Even though my son was with me. He said he had nothing and didn't want nothing from nobody and hung up.

1g8mvhi,https://v.redd.it/z9a84zbyb3wd1,Dinamica plus brew piston appears to leak - any opinions please?,"I just bought a second hand 370.95.t Dinamica Plus, and of course it leaks. The drip tray was overfull when I descaled it (water came out hot water nozzle and coffee spouts), and 2 rinses (water came out coffee spouts, but not water nozzle this time) were enough to refill it. A aubsequent coffee brew resulted in noticeable water on the outside of the front of the unit, below the control panel, which lead me to believe the piston unit may have been at least partially at fault. 

I think I have found the issue - or at least maybe. 

I took the brew piston unit/apparatus out to check it, and noticed that the spring area was half full with water. 

On tipping the unit, the water flowed out the other end of the yellow-transparent plastic unit. I think that shouldn’t happen (shouldn’t it be watertight to assist with pushing pressurised water?), and I probably am now in need of a new unit, but I have a question. 

What could have caused this to happen? I can’t see any crack and the machine notes it has only made 200-300 coffees in total. 

Maybe the solenoid isn’t working? Perhaps that is the reason for both the piston failing and also no water coming out the hot water nozzle when rinsing? Or could it all be down to the faulty piston unit?

1g8mula,https://www.reddit.com/r/wildcampingintheuk/comments/1g8mula/first_wild_camp_oex_bobcat_dartmoor_trip_report/,First Wild Camp - OEX Bobcat - Dartmoor Trip Report,"Hi, first post here as just completed first Wild Camp so thought I would share how it went.

I had a really awesome time and was exactly the kind of adventure I'd hoped it would be.  So thanks to this subreddit for all the advice shared.

**Kit**

I had been planning this for about 6 months, slowly building kit up over time, trying to find a balance between cost and performance.  My loadout ended up being:

OEX Bobcat 1,  Decathlon MT500 Synthetic Sleeping Bag, Naturehike 5.8 Sleeping Pad, Decathlon Cookset and Stove, Scarpa GTX Terra 2 Boots, Eurohike Nepal 65L backpack, dry clothes and waterproofs.  In addition, there were lots of little bits picked up cheap from Ali Express etc.

**Planning**

I've done hikes but never with a full backpack,  So I decided to do a full test run of carrying a full backpack over 8 miles locally to get a feel for it, and then at the end pitching up at a local campsite to practice pitching etc.

This was pretty good advice I had recieved! so definately worth doing if it's your first time as gave me a lot of confidence for my first actual wildcamp.

Now I felt like I was (at least somewhat) ready for my first Wildcamp, so decided to head to Dartmoor for the real thing!   Based on some advice from the Summit or Nothing youtube channel I decided to explore the merrivale area for first outing and it was peace of mind to know I wasn't too far from the Car at any one time.

**The Trip**

I had a feeling I was going to enjoy it but you never really know until you do something for the first time if it's for you...

And wow it was so much fun! Climbing up tors, exploring random places, taking in the scenery and fighting through the rain and mud!  Felt like a real adventure I hadn't had since I was a kid tbh.

Although I did have a few incidents along the way.  I smacked my head on a sticking out rock at Great Mis Tor pretty bad.  Had my first coffee stop of the day on some lovely rocks, got up and bang out of nowhere went straight into it.  I was concerened for a second that I may have had a concussion or needed stiches! so would have to bail on the trip pretty early.   Thankfully after a couple of minutes and a clean up it wasnt so bad so was able to crack on.  But was a good reminder that accidents can happen.

Ended up exploring Kings Tor, Foggintor Quarry, Great Mis Tor, Cox Tor and the Staple Tors. Was a great experience although those Tors are a lot higher up in real life than they looked in pictures!

I was a bit concerend with the weather as the Met was saying gusts of 45mph for the night.  I was a bit unsure about this as part of the trip as some of the appeal to me of wildcamping is being out in bad conditions, but at the same time I dont want to do anything crazy and risky.  So figured I would just go for it and the car wasn't to far away if needed.

I found a place that would be sheltered from the South Winds and in the end was actually pretty comfortable through the night.  So don't know if the wind wasn't as bad at forecast, or the shelter worked, or the Bobcat just did a really good job in the wind? Not sure what was going on, and don't get me wrong it was windy, the bobcat was very flappy inside but the actually main pole was rock solid and didn't move the entire night.  So got a good few hours sleep in the end so was happy with that.

I woke up to being completely shrouded in fog which was lovely and peaceful to have a morning coffee to.  I was pretty keen to get back so used OS Maps to get me back to the car and glad I did cause wows got completely spun around initally in the fog,  so can totally see where people are saying how disorientating it can be.

**Post Trip**

I am back home now in the dry and all cleaned up and have a 'post-camp' feel good feeling that I guess you are probably familar with.   I made tons of mistakes and learnt so much, but there is only so much knowledge you can get from online.

Now I am able to think about how I can improve my set up for next time...

1g8mtt5,https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoHotTakes/comments/1g8mtt5/i_had_an_affair_from_my_toxic_marriage_but_waited/,I had an affair from my toxic marriage but waited to be able to support my kids to leave and be with him. I made a mistake of thinking I couldn’t do it and he ended things and moved on the next day. I left for good and he has told me it’s too late. I am overwhelmed with regret and resentment. ,"Hi, I don’t really know how to explain this without all of the judgement or the I got what I deserved, but really I’m looking for anonymous advice because I just feel so sick. 

I have been married for 13 years, and I have two of the most amazing perfect humans I could ever be so lucky to have. They are kind and funny and loving and I am so proud of them, they are my everything and I will always put them first. 

Their dad, who I met as a teenager myself, is controlling and abusive (not physically). He does not have any patience for any of my needs and expects me to be at his mercy always, I get scared of everything in the relationship as he will get very angry at me. He has financial control over me, I have to send him my wages, he will question every penny I spend and look where I went to spend it (i.e a coffee shop location) i know my youngest is very receptive to his treatment of me and when he has finished shouting and I go upstairs she will come out her room and hug me and ask me if I am okay. He is however, a wonderful dad and when he isn’t being controlling I can be happy, he has loving sides and the family time is everything. 

As the kids got older I started my own career, which other than the financial benefit it had to our household, my husband truly hated the independence it gave me. I still had to send him most of my wages, but I did have a lot more spare than before. I could write a book on the abuse and control but it is beside the point, I’d stayed for the family unit. 

While working I met a friend, let’s call him Dave, and Dave was a wonderful person. He was very funny and understanding and we became very good friends - that was all it was, until one day it wasn’t. At first the attention was nice, and then i was looking forward to speaking to him (important note, my husband is away for work a lot and is not home much of the year). We began an emotional and then physical affair. He told me he loved me and after 4.5 months he told me to leave or he was ending it. This was too soon for me to decide to break my family up and change my children’s whole lives when I didn’t know him well enough. I don’t know how but he decided to stay, maybe two months later he gave me the same ultimatum by breaking up with me and dating someone the next day. During this week, I had a miscarriage and decided that it was him I wanted to be with. He hadn’t supported me through it but, if we would have been together he would have. When we are together he is the best most supportive partner ever. I told him that I would leave and he agreed to be together, I explained that due to the financial circumstances of my marriage I needed to get my life sorted to be able to support my children because really, I still needed to protect them, what if it didn’t work out? I needed to be in a position where I could support them, feed them and afford a house. 

I started to do that, but I needed to do it with my husband initially so as I had the finances to put things into place. I moved house, I got a new job etc, but I couldn’t leave at first, due to the changes in the bills. I was getting into debt but was too scared to ask for more money as he would question why I needed more, it’s funny when you’re in the abuse you don’t see what the actual situation is, I just didn’t understand how I could pay for things to support my children so I told Dave that I couldn’t leave right now as I needed to sort the finances, and one of the large expenses was going soon and then I should be able to. He said he understood. And the husband was away so it wasn’t like I was still living with him, me and David were fully together, calling and texting everyday. 

So from me saying I’m leaving, to moving, sorting all of my finances and promotion then the kids birthdays it’s over an 8 month period. I was then finally ready to leave. I was financially able to leave.  I had the conversation with my husband (who has been away about 5 months of this 8 month period) and our child heard, He was devastated, physically sick, didn’t talk to me and I had a wobble, I tell David, that my kid heard. He says is that’s it? But I say I just need to sort my child first before I decide anything, he says that’s it but messages he loves me the next day. 

We were texting for a week completely normal, loving and planning things even a holiday and I’m handling my child and supporting them through the grief - but then he ends things a week later. I was absolutely devastated, like he had made me so happy and I grieved the loss. I realised I needed to be brave. I messaged him 4 days later and said if I actually leave this time do we have a chance. He didn’t quite tell me, yes or no, he said he isn’t having an affair anymore. 


So I did it, I left my husband. And I went to see him (this is within 2 weeks) and he had already met someone!!! He went absolutely mad I was on my way over and called me a psycho and was very cruel. (It was because she was on her way over). He called me after she left and we’ve spoken every day for nearly a week, he told me he still loves me, but he thinks the damage is done. 

I begged; I told him I loved him. I explained why it took so long to leave because my kids security was more important and he really has heard the abuse I’ve had as I’ve sent recordings. But he said he can’t. 

I am Hurting so much, I know this is awful to say and I know it doesn’t matter but I guess it makes me feel better, the girl, she is not very attractive, I mean she isn’t ugly, but she isn’t pretty and she is much older. so he has been talking to her for only a few weeks. And I didn’t think she would matter. He had spent nearly a week texting me in the three weeks they have been texting and told me he loves me but told me to date someone. 

I don’t want a distraction and I don’t want to move on by rebounding. He’s been sexting me and it was like we used to be. Then today he seemed off. And I knew it is because she is coming over tonight. After he had sexted me that morning. I asked him if she was and he said yes. I said is she sleeping over and he said I was safe, I asked if he promised and he said where had this come from. I apologised for asking and said sorry for asking twice as, I know he wouldn’t sext me that morning and then do that tonight and also he said I was safe so I shouldn’t have asked him to promise when he’d already said no. 

I then said I love you, have a nice date and he went absolutely mad at me. 
Said I was playing games, it was a mind fuck he was DONE with me. I begged and apologised. Said I hadn’t meant any games as I’d been clear throughout the breakup that I wanted to be with him, I’d been saying i love you for a few days. Every night I’d said goodnight I love you - There was no game. 


He then blocked me. And I just need to feel better. This is why I took so long to end things. Because I didn’t want to risk my children over someone who might not fight for us or stick around. I needed to be in a place where I was able to support them alone if that’s what happened to me. 


And I’m sure that I deserve this after having an affair. But I am now heartbroken and would really like comforting advice on how to get over someone I had such a deep connection with. I hate he is messaging someone he doesn’t love to get over me when we could make it work. But I need to know. AITA for saying I love you have a good date?

I wonder if anyone here actually knows what this is and if anyone tried one of those things?

Since I like phins you probably can guess that I like a simple brewing method.

I do weigh but this seems similar to a phin where you just weigh the grounds and bloom and than fill it up?

For taste I do like a ""splash of cream"" which I also weigh (2x grounds).

1g8miqu,https://www.reddit.com/r/EBV/comments/1g8miqu/ebv_igm_positive_does_that_mean_i_have_it/,EBV IgM positive. Does that mean I have it?,"Hi all.

I had an EBV test done in December 2023 and the following results came out:

EBV IgG (VCA IgG) - S <10.0  (0 - 20)

EBV IgM (VCA IgM) - S <25.6  (0 - 20)

EBV EBNA IgG - S <5.4  (0 - 20)

As you can see, IgM is positive. I did the test on my own initiative, as I developed a myriad of issues after my COVID vaccination and COVID itself.

My symptoms have been testicular inflammation (3.5 years, almost resolved by itself now) and RUQ pain for over a year now (also subsided), but I've also had fatty liver for many years, my ultrasounds came back fine and all my blood tests and liver enzymes are ok. The only other recent symptom is left temple headache that's daily from 2 months ago and daily thirst for over 5 months. My mouth is dry constantly and my tongue feels like it has the oral hairy leukoplakia feel (it looks like hairs on the surface), although it looks nothing like pictures online and usually resolved with extensive tooth brushing until the next day (coffee seems to make it worse).

Can someone possibly interpret these results? The weird thing is at the time of these tests and results above, I only had the testicular pain and liver pain symptoms and nothing else.

I also have extremely low levels of Vitamin D and recent left shoulder pain.

I know my last post was a bit of hopefuel, but I'll be honest, it is hard, for me. I know a lot of you have it worse and also I have a boyfriend who loves me, but please remember I am weak and he is several hundred kilometres away from me. So I am sorry in advance if my whining is annoying. I also ask you, if you finish reading this post and the experience is somewhat familiar, please spare some tips if you have any. Thank you in advance, Dear Reader.


I suspected I was an alcoholic for a while now. I mean, at the point I was writing the corner store posts few months back, I had a jaundiced blotch on my tummy, where my liver is. It was not suprising since I spent a few months before that starting each college day with a Monster mixed with vodka and working my way through either more vodka, some beer, a bottle of wine or some combination of the three through out the day. To noones suprise, I failed that year - that is how I ended up at that corner store in the summer after working a few other jobs. As for the jaundiced spot on my liver, it is gone now, since I put down the bottle for a bit when I realized what was happening.


I am doing better now, I went from drinking daily to drinking once, at most twice a week now. My insides still feel like hot soup some days I guess, but that is not the worst part. The worst part is that I really really want to go back to the daily drinking. Everytime someone mentions alcohol I get a shiver down my spine. I sometimes daydream about alcohol. And when that one day per week comes (usually Friday) I go to this cheap bar next to a train station, and I drink until I doze off or space out (of course acting like a total alpha male I am before I do, swinging back shot after shot, being cool and smoking cigarettes) and then march home around midnight or 2 a.m. And I of course feel shit on the way to my parents house - I think about not doing it ever again, how I don't like the people I drink with (more on that later), how I don't like the bar, the country, the city, the country and arguably the world and of course myself. I get home tired and feeling sick, I slide under the sheets like some sort of scared primitive mammal. I wake up a few hours later, still tired but less sick and the cycle begins anew. It seems unbreakable. My boyfriend promises me he won't let me drink when we live together, but I am afraid how I'll act going cold turkey. Part of me doesn't even want to stop.


As for socialization, I just don't like the people around me. I may sound like a theyfab or something, but I can't stand cishet people. Some of the most basic men and women you'd ever meet, with a slight lean to the right of course. Some of them are ""punk"" (the main one is a liberal conservative) some are openly racist (the libcon punks gf started screeching about black people coming to rape everyone in Europe after drinking one bottle of cider) and others are just incredibly boring. Funniest thing is, the last year, I had some pretty okay people around me last year, but due to being a drunk and failing the classes, they don't even look at me anymore. So I'm stuck with these people now, of course still playing up being a slightly unhinged but charming man, smiling, clinking bottles, sharing cigarettes, giving dating advice. And there's no way out.


I guess there is one person that I could be friends with, a girl that helped me get E, but she is moving within her own circles and she admitted she is kinda scared of alcoholics. I don't blame her, we went out for coffee once and talk on Discord sometimes, but between having different intrests and outlooks on life and me having a very big breakdown once when she was in the vicinity, I don't think there is any hope for friendship.


All that is left is wait a couple years until I can run away with my boyfriend, somewhere far away, but what I fear is that I will still be dragging the current me along. And that aside from him, I will have noone else. Don't get me wrong, I can live like this, I only need him, but it'd be nice to have actual friends outside of Discord I can hang out with, talk sincerely. Not daydreaming about alcohol would be nice too I guess.


I am sorry for the babbling.

1g8me20,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xenomorphseverywhere/comments/1g8me20/xenomorphs_everywhere_chapter_25_part_01/,Xenomorphs Everywhere Chapter 25 Part 01,"**Alien queen's hive**

The temperature in the Alien Queen's hive has risen dramatically during the night and morning and it is now 67 degrees in her hive and condensation is constantly dripping from the ceiling onto the Alien Queen's crowned head, but she is not bothered by the dripping, but by the high heat. The reason it has gotten so hot in the Alien queen's hive is because there has been a technical fault in the heating system so that the water in the facility continues to heat up even though it is already warm enough and the heat continues to rise.

The high heat in the Alien queen's hive affects the fluid in the egg sac in a negative way. Thousands of small bubbles form in the silky liquid in the egg sac and the bubbles rise to the surface and pop. Each time the bubbles pop, some of the silky liquid splashes out from the open part of the egg sac where Michael thrust his hands. Because there are over a thousand bubbles that rise to the surface, it pops and splashes non-stop. The reason why a lot of bubbles form in the liquid is because the liquid has almost reached its boiling point. Most liquids boil at 100 degrees, but the liquid in the Alien queen's egg sac begins to boil already at 70 degrees. The alien queen can feel lots of steam rising from the part of the egg sac that is attached to her body and she finds it uncomfortable as the steam rises right up her anus.

The alien queen's ovipositor is undulating strongly and there are five eggs per minute and it's really far too often but the production of the eggs has also increased since the previous day and the alien queen has had to eat from some metal sitting above her to get enough nutrition so that she can produce the eggs. Some of the metal above her is holding her heavy body so the Alien Queen didn't want to eat the metal at first but she was forced to. Several Alien warriors have also fed the Alien queen with various metals they have found in the tunnel.

The temperature in the Alien queen's hive continues to rise and finally it is 70 degrees in her hive and the liquid in the egg sac begins to boil. There are no longer any bubbles rising from the silky liquid but it is violently moving back and forth and it begins to pour out of the opening where Michael thrust his hands. The egg sac itself vibrates strongly from the boiling liquid and the hot steam shoots up into the Alien queen's anus. The fluid that is at the opening of the egg sac is very thick and it pours out of the egg sac like a thick cream and when enough liquid has formed on top of the egg sac, the law of gravity causes it to slowly flow down the outside of the egg sac. The thick fluid hangs from the outside of the egg sac as a thick slime and it looks like transparent and very slimy snot or colorless slime. Finally, the thick liquid lands on the ground with a loud plop.

The boiling liquid continues to pour out of the egg sac, but it has become more fluid and flows continuously along the outside of the egg sac. Several of the eggs in the egg sac that are close to the opening are pushed up from the egg sac but slide down into the silky fluid again but they are pushed up again and slide down again. None of the eggs get anywhere because it's boiling so hard in the egg sac and they just go up and down the opening while the boiling silky liquid continues to pour out of the opening non-stop. It gets very sticky on the ground under the egg sac and the silky liquid flows onto the ground and approaches the Alien queen.

The alien queen's ovipositor continuously squirts out eggs and several of the eggs are not even fully developed when they come out of the ovipositor and when they land on the ground they sink into a dark brown goo and the unfinished facehuggers die immediately. Some of the unfinished eggs start to flow as loose yolk and it looks like they are melting. It is as if the ovipositor has suffered from severe diarrhea but instead of faeces it spews out eggs and boiling liquid. At the beginning, when the eggs started to shoot out of the ovipositor, several of the eggs were already ready to be laid, but due to the high pressure that occurs when the liquid boils, many unfinished eggs manage to squeeze past the finished eggs because the unfinished eggs weigh less than the finished eggs and have a smaller circumference. The boiling causes several of the eggs to thump against each other as they move through the egg sac.

Because the ovipositor continuously ejects eggs, the eggs land on top of each other even though the Alien queen is constantly moving her ovipositor. There is such a large pile of eggs in several places that they cannot eject from the ovipositor and the ovipositor immediately begins to swell greatly and bulge to the sides in an abnormal way and the ovoid eggs push the already bulging ovipositor to the sides and it looks almost grotesque looking. The alien queen lifts her ovipositor as much as she can and some of the eggs land on top of other eggs, but it soon starts to bulge out to the sides again and swell strongly as it stops ejecting the eggs. The alien queen moves her ovipositor again and the first 6 eggs that have gathered at the bottom fit on top of each other, but then the ovipositor can eject the eggs and begins to swell strongly and bulge out. Because the eggs spray out without a break, the Alien warriors do not have time to move the eggs before the pile of eggs becomes too large.

The alien queen is upset and makes several high-pitched screams because the ovipositor hurts and the hot steam that shoots up her anus is so hot it burns. The alien queen's warriors approach their queen and seem to try to help her but they can't help her with this problem. The alien queen looks at the ovipositor, which continuously ejects eggs, and at the egg sac, where boiling liquid is constantly pouring out, and she makes an active choice and decides to detach herself from her egg sac. There is no other way to solve this problem. The alien queen's egg sac is stuck to her in two different places. Partly under the anus but also where the ribcage ends and it is easiest for her to detach herself at the anus and she starts to stand up. The alien queen has always squatted in her hive but she has very long legs that she can stand up on. The eggsac begins to detach from the anus and there is a stretching sound and it stings badly in the anus, but the hot steam feels worse than the sting that she feels. When the eggsac has detached from the anus, the Alien queen continues to rise slowly.

The egg sack stuck under the ribcage also begins to come loose and there are loud sticky and stretching sounds as it comes off and the Alien Queen hisses loudly because it hurts more than when she detached the egg sac from her anus. The alien queen is stubborn and continues to rise and finally this part of the egg sac detaches from her body and she is free. The boiling liquid and masses of eggs spill out from the two parts of the egg sac and begin to fill the ground around the Alien queen. Even though the Alien Queen has been squatting when she has been in her hive, she still has very strong legs. The alien queen is careless when she rises and suddenly she hits her crowned head on the ceiling of the space because she has risen so high. The Alien Queen lowers her legs and begins to move forward into the space and she makes a sound that causes all the Alien warriors to follow her. The alien queen leaves her hive and comes out into the tunnel and she's never been here before so she doesn't know where to go.

The alien queen chooses to follow Michael's scent trail and she keeps moving forward as she approaches the exit of the tunnel. The Alien Queen can feel how fresh air moves through the tunnel and she becomes curious about the exciting world she is on her way to.,When the Alien Queen has come out onto the road outside the tunnel, she is almost hit by a motorist and she angrily pushes away the car and makes a loud screeching sound

**Slussen**

Hulda is on her way to the grocery store in Slussen and she has intended to buy their delicious honeydew melon. The honeydew melon that Hulda is going to buy is only sold by the grocery store. Hulda is 45 years old and nine months pregnant, and she feels that she cannot do without this honeydew melon.

Hulda has been pregnant once before, but that pregnancy was very different from this one. It was barely visible on Hulda's belly when she was pregnant the first time, but this time she has a really big belly to brag about. No one who sees Hulda can avoid seeing her huge protruding belly and she likes the attention she gets. People that Hulda meets like to stop and talk to her and they ask about her pregnancy and wish her luck. Hulda also blogs every day about her pregnancy and many people read her blog. Hulda can feel the baby moving in her stomach as she approaches the store and she smiles at feeling the baby's movements.

Hulda goes into the store and buys two large honeydew melons that are already split and pays at the register and leaves the store. Hulda has decided to visit Skansen because she likes the nice zoo. There aren't that many people moving in Slussen today even though it's Saturday. Hulda feels that she has to go to the bathroom again. That's one of the downsides of being pregnant. Hulda enters the ladies' toilet and finds an empty toilet stall. There is something large and dark brown in the booth and the top of the object resembles the opening of an ass. There are also four leaf like things around the opening. The object is next to the toilet itself, so Hulda can still fit in the toilet stall and she sits on the toilet. Hulda can see that the top of the object looks very slimy and she looks the other way.

Hulda suddenly hears an intimate and sticky sound and she turns her head and looks at the object and she sees the four leaf like things open up and wrap around the object itself and Hulda begins to think that the object looks like a large egg. Hulda can look down into the object where she is sitting on the toilet seat and she can see something light moving further down the object and she is at first curious as to what it is but then she becomes worried. Perhaps what moves further down the object is dangerous. There is a lot of clear slime in the object and it is a bit like lubricant but doesn't seem to have any particular scent.

The facehugger explodes out of the egg and Hulda doesn't have time to react but she sees a smaller beast with eight finger-like legs jump towards her face. The facehugger lands on Hulda's face and a chemical reaction occurs when the inside of the facehugger meets Hulda's skin and she becomes unconscious, and because the facehugger is so heavy, Hulda's head bends backwards and lies above the toilet flush button.

The facehugger thrusts its long and elastic proboscis through Hulda's mouth and it moves down towards her throat. The proboscis penetrates down through the throat and when it has penetrated far enough, it stops and begins to swell while continuously giving Hulda oxygen. When the proboscis has swollen to double its thickness, hundreds of small black eggs begin to shoot out from it and the eggs move down towards the chest region. The proboscis continues to eject its eggs for about two minutes and when they are finished the proboscis becomes limp and regains its normal thickness and it is drawn into the body of the facehugger and soon only the opening of the proboscis is visible. The facehugger detaches from Hulda's face and crawls behind the toilet and lies there. Hulda wakes up after a few minutes and she gets up and flushes and leaves the toilet. Hulda doesn't even turn around and look at the egg.

Hulda leaves Slussen and approaches Skeppsholmen and she finds an empty seat by the benches and picks up one of the split melons and she also takes out a bigger spoon that she has in her backpack and then she starts to eat the melon and it is so good and she enjoys the good taste. Hulda wonders if her expecting child will also like this melon when its adult enough to taste it. In the meantime, a Chestburster begins to grow in Hulda's chest and it absorbs the nutrition that the unborn child would have received and thus grows faster. So far, Hulda can't feel the extra weight that comes when the Chestburster grows bigger.

The water glistens in the sunlight and 38-year-old Douglas approaches his boat. It is a fairly large boat and it is possible to both sleep in it and cook, but Douglas only intends to be out with the boat for a few hours. Since it's Saturday and Douglas is off from his job and won't be working until Monday, he can sleep over in the boat if he wants, but today he feels like he just wants to be out at sea for a few hours.

It's full of boats at the big dock but Douglas has parked close to his boat and he could already see it from the car window. As Douglas gets closer to the boat, he sees something large and dark brown in his boat and at first he thinks it looks like a giant poo, but when he gets even closer, he thinks it looks more like a big egg. Douglas looks at the big egg and wonders what it's doing in his boat. The egg is on the boat's deck just in front of the stairs that go down to the boat's cabin. The cabin consists of a spacious kitchen and bedroom and a smaller toilet. There is a large table in the kitchen for Douglas to sit at and he even has a small TV hanging on one of the walls. Douglas looks at the boat next to his but there is no egg there and not in the next boat either and Douglas thinks that someone must have wanted to play a joke on him.

Douglas steps aboard the foredeck and loosens the fenders and everything else that holds the boat in place at the dock and soon the boat is ready to leave the dock and drive out to sea. Douglas can see the blue water of Riddarfjärden and that is where he is going and he goes down to the deck and looks at the egg and thinks about what to do with it. The egg looks heavy and Douglas can see that it has four leaf like things around an opening that looks most like an ass. Douglas has a dirty imagination and immediately sees some sexual overtones on this egg and thinks that the person who created it likes sex and especially body openings. Douglas thinks he might be able to lift the egg and place it on the edge of the dock and he bends over the egg and crouches at the same time and this makes it easier for him to lift the heavy object.

Douglas hears a sticky sound and sees the four leaf like things around the opening of the egg open up like a big flower and they settle around the sides of the egg. Douglas looks down into the egg and sees that it contains lots of clear mucus and it looks like thick string. But Douglas can also see something bright in the middle of the egg and whatever it is, it moves and Douglas immediately becomes alert and starts backing away from the egg. Douglas no longer believes that it is someone who wanted to play a joke on him, but this is something else and he is not sure if it is dangerous or not. Too many strange things have been happening lately and it's worried Douglas. Sweden is no longer as safe as it once was.

The facehugger jumps up from the egg in a big explosion and it splatters transparent slime everywhere. Douglas watches as the facehugger approaches his face and it moves significantly faster than he does and he realizes that it will land on his face. Time seems to pass both quickly and slowly and Douglas feels that he should get away from this beast but his feet are moving far too slowly. The facehugger lands in Douglas's face but it ends up slanted and the inside of it therefore does not meet Douglas' skin.

The facehugger thrusts its long proboscis through Douglas's mouth and since he is still conscious he can feel the slimy and slippery proboscis moving forward in his mouth and he feels raped. Douglas tries to bite the facehuggers proboscis, but because it is so slippery and slimy, Douglas's teeth can't get a good grip on it. Douglas grabs the facehuggers tail and tries to pull the beast away from his face but he soon notices that the strong tail is starting to strangle him so he lets go. The facehuggers proboscis has begun to penetrate through Douglas's throat and he panics as he can no longer breathe through his mouth, but he notices a few seconds later that the beast is giving him oxygen through its proboscis. The facehuggers proboscis penetrates deeper and deeper into Douglas's throat and he is so disgusted by what is happening that he almost starts to vomit. The proboscis stops but Douglas can feel it start to swell and vibrate and it teases his gag reflex. The proboscis begins to shoot out hundreds of small black eggs and Douglas can't actually feel the eggs themselves but he can feel them shoot out through the proboscis because the eggs are felt through the proboscis and it moves in a wavy motion as the eggs shoot out through it.

Douglas thinks this is terrible. Douglas has a dirty imagination and has both seen and been part of some disgusting things, but this is the very worst thing he has been part of. Douglas tries once more to bite the facehuggers proboscis and this time his teeth get a grip on the slippery and slimy proboscis and the slime seeps into his gums but Douglas sinks his teeth into the billowing proboscis.

The facehugger feels what Douglas is doing and it pushes its body harder against Douglas' face and now the inside of the facehugger meets Douglas' skin and a chemical reaction occurs which causes Douglas to lose consciousness and fall onto the deck. When the facehugger landed on Douglas's face, he was standing very close to the boat's railing, but in the meantime Douglas has moved so that he is standing by the door that leads down to the cabin where he can sleep and cook. If Douglas had remained at the railing when he lost consciousness, he could have fallen overboard and ended up in the water, but now he lands on the first step that leads down to the cabin. The facehuggers proboscis continues to eject the black eggs, but after a minute and a half they run out and the facehuggers proboscis becomes narrow as it usually is. The facehugger pulls its proboscis back into its body and detaches itself from Douglas's face. The facehugger crawls around on the deck, looking for a place to die.

Douglas wakes up after a few minutes and he immediately starts to fight with his arms but he very quickly notices that the beast has come loose from his face and that he is lying down. Douglas turns his head and can see down into the cabin that is just behind him and he thinks that it was lucky that his body didn't tumble down the stairs. Douglas can't see the little beast anywhere in the cabin and he's relieved. Douglas moves his tongue and feels the slime from the facehuggers proboscis moving between his teeth and he immediately feels nauseous and hurries to sit up. The sickness gets worse and Douglas gets up quickly and stands in front of the railing and vomits in the water. Douglas hopes that what he felt being spewed down his throat comes with the vomit and when he has finished vomiting, he stands leaning over the railing for a good while and just breathes.

Douglas hears a scratching sound behind him and he turns to see the facehugger still crawling around on the floor and Douglas quickly walks over to the little beast and grabs its long tail firmly and lifts the little beast up so that it hangs a bit above the ground. Douglas sees the facehuggers proboscis hanging out of its body like a penis and he first intends to push his finger through the proboscis so that the beast can feel what it's like to be orally raped, but Douglas changes his mind and throws the little beast into the water instead. The facehugger cannot swim and it soon drowns. Douglas looks at the large egg and walks over to it and begins to lift it. The egg is not that heavy but some of the slime sloshes onto the deck and it becomes slippery so Douglas has to walk carefully. Douglas throws the egg into the water and it sinks very quickly and disappears from view.

Douglas considers if he should contact the Emergency services and have them examine him considering he felt something unknown being shot down his throat and it would make perfect sense to do so but Douglas decides not to and instead goes out with his Boat. Douglas starts the boat's engine and it starts with a roar on the first try and Douglas steers his boat off the dock and out into the sparkling sea. When the boat has left the dock a bit and no longer needs to be steered as much, Douglas feels that he is very hungry and he opens his rucksack and takes out two sandwiches with liver pate and his old steel thermos, which today contains hot chocolate. Douglas fills the thermos cup with the hot chocolate and eats the first sandwich and the sour taste from the vomit disappears but also the remaining mucus that is between the teeth. Douglas carefully turns the rudder so the boat is on a straight course ahead and then he eats the second sandwich and refills the cup with more hot chocolate. The air is already 25 degrees and Douglas guesses that it will get hotter during the day and he thinks about whether he shouldn't go a little further after all and maybe sleep in the boat. It's such a nice day for a boat trip.

**Lars Café (near Essingen)**

Michael has finished his tea and Sven has finished his coffee but he goes and fills his mug with more coffee and after a few seconds Michael goes and fills his mug with more tea. Michael is in no hurry to go home.

Krister could not say whether Michael would still have a curfew or not. He said he would think about it. If Krister finds out that it was Michael who placed all the eggs in the Kungsträdgården and the Karolinska hospital, he will guarantee that Michael does not leave the accommodation when he comes home. Michael thinks punishment is very silly.

Michael sits and thinks about the question about whether he felt power when he placed the eggs and he is becoming more and more sure of his answer, but he is unsure if he dares to admit this to Sven. Michael looks at Sven with a serious expression.

- Sven, can you keep a secret? You know, something that only you and I know about?

- Sure, no problem. What is it about?

- Do you promise not to get angry?

- It depends on what you have to say, but you know that I usually have a hard time getting angry.

- This question you asked about whether I felt power when I placed the eggs.

- Yes.

- Well, I felt absolute power yesterday when I placed all the eggs. It was like my whole body was vibrating with lust and power and I couldn't wait for the people to be attacked by the facehuggers. I didn't see when all 42 people were attacked but I saw when several of them were. I also saw when the three animals were each attacked by a facehugger. This girl that I made sure she came home, her father was. uh, I don't know if I should say this.

- It's okay, you can tell me.

- The father of the child belonged to one of the bullies at school and I tricked him into one of the eggs and made sure he was attacked by a facehugger but I didn't know he had started a family and had a child with him but the child wasn't around then this happened. I think she was with a friend at the time. She never found out what happened to her father. He went into a toilet before the Chestburster was born from his chest but I was standing outside and heard when it was born. It was cool watching all the facehuggers jump up at people's faces and then seeing all the chestbursters being borned but when I got home I just felt..empty.

- I understand. This feeling of emptiness is a psychological reaction when the body is no longer rewarded with stimuli from the power that you felt. It is very common to feel that way. How do you feel now? Would you like to place more eggs, for example outside this cafe?

- No, I don't want to do that. I'm probably feeling as usual, but at the same time I'm excited that you're going to meet the Alien Queen for the first time. It will be so exciting. I know she won't hurt you so it's not about that but you finally getting to meet her.

- That sounds good. You probably realized that you didn't make a good choice when you placed all the eggs the previous day.

- You're probably right. I saw several Alien warriors coming out of the tunnel and they had many eggs with them and I followed them to see where they placed the eggs but this was after I had placed all the eggs in Kungsträdgården.

- Where did the Alien warriors place the eggs?

- On Sveavägen.

- Did you see someone on Sveavägen who was attacked by a facehugger?

- I saw someone who was standing at an ATM being attacked, but I had the child in the wooden cart at the time and cycled through the tunnel after the Alien warriors went back in there.

- You went with them in the tunnel?

- Yes, and then I greeted the Alien queen one last time and you called.

- I think I understand.

Suddenly, several loud screams of terror are heard outside the cafe and Michael turns to the window and looks out to see lots of people running around in panic, pointing at something coming from the left. Michael can't see what the people are pointing at, but he can see that they are hurriedly moving away from the cafe. Several people who are further away also move away from the cafe. A few seconds later, Michael sees the reason for the people's panic. Seven Alien warriors come walking from the left but they are not carrying any eggs and Michael thinks it is strange.

The seven Alien warriors pass right outside the cafe and Michael sees a movement just behind them and thinks there are more Alien warriors, but a few seconds later he sees that it is not. The Alien Queen comes walking right after the seven Alien warriors and Michael can see that parts of her egg sac are hanging under her tail and on the front of her body and he realizes that she must have detached herself from her egg sac for some reason. The alien queen's dark body glistens with moisture and water regularly drips from her crowned head. Michael sits and looks at the Alien queen for a few seconds, but then he quickly stands up.

- Sven, we go down to her. Hurry before she has passed.

- Is that the Alien Queen? What is she doing here?

- It´s her. I have no idea why she's here. We must hurry before she has left.

Sven also gets up and both he and Michel go down the stairs and leave the cafe and they hurry out through the exit. The alien queen has quite a high speed as she moves forward.

My first thought was that she had accidentally parked in a disabled reserved spot so I went with her to the parking lot, she pointed at my car (which she didn’t recognised for some reason) stating that was said r*tarded.

Now my car was not parked perfectly, it was an almost full lot, one of the only few free spots had a wall on the side, it was not very big and I might’ve underestimated my car dimensions so I ended up with one wheel on the line, my intention was not invading another spot, but my car is big and there was literally a wall on the other side.

Her car is very small and could fit in the space left, but I still told her I could move the car if she wanted.

She was visibly mortified and apologised for what she said.

I didn’t get offended or anything, I know it was nothing personal, but…I don’t know? Calling someone an ableist slur because they parked on the lines felt…a little too much?

Michael leaves the apartment building at 10.55 am and stands waiting for Sven to pick him up and Sven comes driving at 10.59 am and parks right next to Michael. Michael gets into the front seat and sits down and Sven starts to drive to Lars' café. Michael is very eager and starts talking right away.

- It was so cool yesterday when I was in the Alien queen's hive. I let her lay tons of eggs on my body and when she was done my clothes were wet with all the mucus from the ovipositor.

- You told me about that yesterday when I called you, but I can't understand why you let her lay her eggs on you. It feels very strange.

- I just got the idea to let her do it. She trusts me.

- Do you trust her then?

- Of course. After you called I was going to go home straight away but I came up with a fun thing that I did first.

- And that was?

- I pushed my hands into her egg sac and felt the silky liquid. The warm liquid welled up over my arms and it was so nice. You have to try that when I show her.

- Er, you did what?

- I pushed my arms into her egg sac and felt the warm silky liquid. There was a large hole in the upper part of the egg sac and I climbed up there and plunged my arms into the liquid. Some of the liquid was really thick like heavy whipped cream and some of it was like liquid water.

- But how did the Alien queen react to that?

- I don't even think she knows what I did. I had to climb a wall to get there. There are steps in the wall so it was easy to get there. There is a wide extension directly above the egg sac and I lay on it and pushed my hands into the egg sac.

- Weren't you afraid of falling to the ground or into the egg sac?

- No, it felt safe. You can also try and do the same thing.

- No thanks. I refrain from that.

Michael laughs as he remembers how the liquid felt against his skin but then sits quietly and Sven sits and thinks about what Michael has just told him and he starts to think if this hasn´t gone too far.

That Michael meets the Alien Queen and is close to her is worrying in itself, but that he also lets her lay several eggs on Michael's body and that Michael also climbs up and pushes his hands into the Alien Queen's egg sac feels even more worrying. It feels like Michael is doing rougher and rougher things when he meets the Alien queen and Sven wonders if Michael doesn't have some very sick sexual desire and that's why he's done this. If so, it should be stopped immediately, for the sake of both Michael and the Alien Queen. Sven thinks about how to explain to Michael how wrong this behavior is.

Michael looks at Sven.

- You will understand the Alien Queen when you meet her.

- I hope so.

 Sven continues to drive and soon they arrive at Lars' cafe and Sven parks the car in a free parking space and Sven and Michael enter the cafe.

**Lars Café (Near Essingen)**

Michael chooses a cinnamon bun as usual and also the same tea with apple and cinnamon flavor while Sven chooses a shrimp sandwich and a vanilla bun and coffee and they sit in their usual place. Michael starts to eat his cinnamon roll but puts it on his plate.

- I know where the Alien queen and her hive are. Well i mean on a map.

- Well, where is she and how do you know where the hive is?

- She is under Högatidsparken. I found a map when I was down in the hive. I think someone or a few who do urban exploration found the hive by accident. There were several backpacks on the ground in the hive but no people.

- Högatidsparken? Hmm. It is located near Hornstull.

- I know. We often had gymnastics there when I was in school.

- There is an old heating plant right nearby.

- Oh, so that's why it's so hot in the hive. I found a thermometer in one of the backpacks and the thermometer read 49 degrees Celsius but I'm not sure if that was right.

- That doesn't sound reasonable. If it's really that hot in the Alien queen's hive, it's definitely not healthy to be there. The human body cannot withstand such high temperatures for a long time.

- Then it must have shown an error. By the way, I was a hero yesterday.

- How?

- I made sure that a child who had lost its father came home to its mother.

- How?

- I cycled home to the mother and the child was sitting in a wooden cart.

- What kind of wooden cart? You don't have a wooden cart, do you? Did it belong to the father?

- The wooden cart was in our bike room and I simply put it on the bike.

- But who owned the wooden cart then and why did you use a wooden cart?

- There was no name on it and I thought it was fun to use it. I cycled to the Alien queen's hive after I put on the wooden cart.

- So you had it with you when you visited the Alien queen? What time was that?

- Hmm. It was after 09 am anyway.

- But did you have the wooden cart with you when you cycled to Kungsträdgården?

- Absolutely. I left the wooden cart back in the bike room when I got home an hour or so after I talked to you.

- How big was the wooden cart?

- Large enough so that the child could sit in it without problems.

- Then it must have been quite long and large

- Yes, that's right. Don't you think it's good that I helped the child home?

- Yes, of course. What time did you arrive at Kungsträdgården?

- It must have been just before 11 am when I came back from .eh another place.

- Which place then? The alien queen's hive?

- Well, just one place. It doesn't matter. Er, I just have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back.

- Okay, do so.

Michael leaves the table and goes to the toilet and Sven is left alone and there are a thousand thoughts going through his head but when Sven starts to collect all the information he has received during yesterday and this conversation it appears all too clear .

It was Michael who left all the eggs in the Kungsträdgården and maybe also... at the Karolinska hospital. Sven doesn't even want to think about the latter, but somehow the pieces of the puzzle are slowly falling into place. Michael's question if Edith was still in the emergency room, as well as his reluctance to say where he had been before coming to the Kungsträdgården, makes Sven absolutely certain that it was Michael who placed the eggs in the hospital. Sven heard on the news in the evening that Chestbursters had been born on every floor of the hospital except the emergency room and he now understands that Michael placed the eggs on every floor but not in the emergency room. Sven tenses one hand and thinks quietly.

*Michael, why? Why would the other patients in the hospital die? What had they done to you? Why would the people at Kungsträdgården die? Is this about the power you feel when innocent people die?*

Sven thinks that it would probably have been good if Michael met a psychologist who had a serious talk with him and questioned his decision, both for Michael's sake and for the sake of others. Sven thinks the worst thing is that Michael doesn't seem to understand how wrong this is. He seemed almost proud yesterday when he said that he had seen several Chestbursters being born up close and also some adult Alien monsters from some animals. Michael should understand that this is not something positive but the opposite.

Then there's this problem with Michael letting the Alien Queen lay her eggs on his body and him sticking his arms into her egg sac and feeling the liquid. Sven doesn't care how the Alien queen feels but more why Michael thought this was a good idea and the only thing he can think of is that Michael is somehow sexually aroused by this and it needs to be stopped immediately. Sven knows that there are other people who like this kind of thing, but he is not going to let Michael become such a person.

Sven sits and thinks and hears in the background how some of the guests at the cafe are whispering to each other and he begins to listen to what they are whispering

""I thought I saw him just now. He was sitting a little further away""

""Should we call the police and say he's here?""

""Are you sure it's him?""

""I recognize his face from the TV pictures from Kungsträdgården""

""It's him. Call the police right away""

""He is coming back now. Yeah its definitely him""

Michael comes back and sits down and finishes eating his cinnamon roll. Sven looks at Michael with a serious face and he doesn't react at first but sees Sven's face and stops his chewing.

- What?

- Michael, what the hell have you done?

- I haven't done anything, have I?

- Well, you have and I think it's time you and I have a serious talk. Michael, I know it was you who left the eggs at Karolinska hospital and Kungsträdgården and I want to know why.

- Now what are you saying?

- You can't lie to me. I want to know why you left the eggs in the hospital and in Kungsträdgården. It is possible that the police are looking for you but I want to hear a proper answer from you. This is not about my Grandma Edith but why you did what you did. Did you feel empowered when you placed the eggs? Please, MIchael explain. I want to know.

.Michael realizes that he has been exposed and he starts to sweat and feels penetrated but he still tries to sound normal when he answers.

- Do we have to talk about this where others can hear us? Isn't it better to talk about it when we're in the tunnel or the Alien queen's hive?

- Okay, we can do that. But I also want to discuss this with you letting the Alien Queen lay her eggs on your body and you pushing your arms into the egg sac. Were you sexually aroused when these two things happened?

- No, it was just awesome.

- Answer honestly now.

- Okay, I felt a little tingle in my organ when an egg landed on a sensitive spot, but not when I felt the fluid in the egg sac. I felt some sexual satisfaction when I saw several Chestbursters being born up close. It was such a force when they were born. It's hard to explain.

- I think I understand what you mean. Michael, I think you should see a psychologist and discuss this with the psychologist. I don't want you to get hurt.

Michael eats the last of his cinnamon bun and drinks the last of the tea in the mug and Sven eats his vanilla bun and they sit and look at each other. Michael suddenly looks embarrassed.

- If I knew your grandmother was in another ward, I wouldn't have placed any eggs in the hospital. It was just a crazy idea I had. It was the same with Kungsträdgården but...

- But what?

- I saw that the eggs were coming even faster from the ovipositor than the previous day and most of the space was flooded with eggs so I decided to help the Alien queen and place the eggs so that the others left in the egg sac would have a place. I knew there would be many people coming to Kungsträdgården and the first people to be attacked by facehuggers were typical rude white trash people and they are really not needed in society. so I made a choice and tricked some of them towards the eggs and boom. Facehugged.

- I am disgusted by you. Michael. How can you think you are better than them when you do this?

- I'm not usually rude. Some of the ones I tricked into the eggs were selling drugs. No one in society needs that kind of people except those who buy the drugs. They are not needed so that you and I can sit here and drink coffee and eat vanilla buns or, like me, drink tea and eat cinnamon buns. If you say they are needed, you are lying.

- It sounds terrible to say that, but okay, maybe those people aren't needed. But the others who were innocent and who died. Why did you let them get attacked?

- I didn't see when everyone was attacked. I left 45 eggs in the park so I didn't have time to see when each human was attacked.

- 45 eggs? My God. Wasnt 10 or 20 eggs enough?

- I wanted to remove as many eggs as possible from the Alien queen's hive so that it would be easier to walk around in there without tripping over a lot of eggs.

- How many eggs did you leave at the Karolinska hospital?

- 15. One on each floor except the emergency room.

Sven sits still and thinks. 15 eggs. It was extremely bad luck that Edith was attacked by a facehugger. Michael could not have guessed that would happen even if he knew she was in another department and Sven decides not to be angry with Michael even if he was the one who placed the egg in question. Michael sits and looks out at the people moving outside the cafe and he sees that many of them are not moving as relaxed as they usually do but are more alert and suspicious and he knows that it is his fault that it is so.

**Kottegatan**

It is 6:10 am when the gate to the apartment building opens and Arnold goes out into the street. Arnold is 102 years old and is an old war veteran and he was in the Second World War and fought against the Germans, but Arnold lived in England at the time. Arnold has lived in Sweden since 2002 when he moved to Stockholm and he enjoys Sweden so he does not want to move back. Arnold left a bad relationship and a sick mother when he moved to Sweden and the mother is no longer alive and the lady he lived with has taken her own life so she is no longer around either.

Arnold is a morning person and he loves to go these early walks. So far he is alone on the street because many people are still sleeping and even though Arnold is in Stockholm city, everything is quiet and still and only the wind blows lightly in the trees. The birds have woken up but they are quite quiet so far and are flying around looking for food. Arnold has never smoked or snorted or drank much alcohol and he has always eaten things that are good for the body, except for a little candy now and then and that has caused him to get this old. Arnold is still enjoying his life, although he has become a bit forgetful lately.

Arnold walks forward along the street and looks around and when he finds a discarded piece of paper or other trash on the ground, he picks it up and puts it in the nearest trash can. Arnold finds it amusing to clean up after the young people who usually walk around the street during the day. There is a residence nearby and they have not protected their Wifi so the young people use the open Wifi and surf and other things. Arnold continues on the street and when he comes to the end of the street he goes left and comes to Adelvägen and he stops.

**Adelvägen**

In the middle of the long street, there is something that makes Arnold's heart rate rise. It's a German bomb and Arnold's thoughts go straight to the war. Arnold is close to throwing himself on the ground but his body is no longer as compliant as it was before and he considers the object in front of him. After a few seconds, Arnold realizes that it is not a German bomb but something else, but he is still very vigilant. The object is dark brown and leathery and the top of the object looks mostly like the opening of an ass but there are four leaf like things around the opening. Arnold thinks this object looks grotesque with obvious sex and body references but he knows that this kind of thing is sometimes called modern art. Arnold approaches the object and when he gets close to it he can see lively movement inside the object and now when he is closer Arnold thinks the object looks like a large egg.

Suddenly the four leafes open and it looks just like when a flower open up its leaves and the four leaves settle around the egg. Arnold can see that the egg contains lots of clear slime but he can also see something light moving further down the egg and he begins to back away from the egg. The facehugger explodes out of the egg and transparent slime splatters everywhere and some of it lands on Arnold's face and a few seconds later the facehugger lands on Arnold's face and when the facehugger's inner skin meets Arnold's a chemical reaction occurs and Arnold loses consciousness and he falls backwards and lands on the ground. The facehugger thrusts its long and elastic proboscis through Arnold's mouth and it soon penetrates his throat and continues downwards. When the proboscis has reached far enough down the throat, it swells and soon hundreds of small black eggs shoot through the proboscis. The eggs look almost like black caviar, but unlike black caviar, these eggs are not healthy for humans.

The proboscis continues to squirt out the small black eggs for two minutes but soon they run out and the facehugger pulls its proboscis from Arnold's throat and detaches from his face. The Facehugger crawls its way down the street to find a quiet place where it can die.

Arnold wakes up after a few minutes and is surprised to find himself on the ground and he carefully raises his head and gets up. Arnold sees the open egg and is disgusted by it. Arnold looks at his watch and discovers that it is already 6.45 am and he has planned to be outside MeraMat at 7 am when they open and he is in a hurry and leaves Adelvägen and goes back to Kottegatan. Arnold walks quickly and soon he is standing outside MeraMat.

**MeraMat**

The store doors open and Arnold and six other people enter the store and Arnold goes straight to the bread shelf and he can smell the freshly baked rolls as he approaches the bread shelf. Arnold always buys freshly baked rolls on Saturdays and he puts three rolls in a bread bag and walks away towards the jam. Arnold is going to buy orange marmalade because the one he usually has in the fridge at home has run out. When Arnold has taken a jar of orange marmalade in his hand, he goes towards the milk and that is the last thing he will buy today. Arnold feels a strange movement in his chest as he heads for the milk but he chooses to ignore the movement. Arnold reaches for the first carton of milk and takes it in his hand and he begins to walk towards the store's cash register.

There is a loud gnawing sound from within Arnold's chest and he stops and looks down at his chest. Now what kind of crap is this? Arnold presses his hand hard against his chest and the sound stops. Arnold starts to walk towards the cash register again and when he arrives he sees that there are two people in the queue and he stands at the back of the queue. Suddenly, Arnold's chest is pushed out by something and he can faintly see a snake-like shape through the skin on his chest and at the same time he gets a lot of pain in his back. After a few seconds the form disappears and the chest looks normal but Arnold realizes that something is very wrong and he thinks if he should call 911 but since both his hands are busy holding the goods he decides to call after he have paid for the goods. Now there is only one person in the queue and Arnold moves forward.

The gnawing sound from Arnold's chest is heard again and it's even louder this time and the female customer who is putting her things on the checkout belt hears the sound and she turns and stares at Arnold and she looks pissed. The woman turns to her goods after a few seconds and takes out her bank card to pay for her goods. Meanwhile, the gnawing sound continues and Arnold's chest is pushed out again and Arnold can now clearly see the snake-like creature through the skin and it scares him. Arnold almost died during World War II when he was fighting the Germans, but after that, Arnold has never felt afraid, until now. This snake-like form that can be seen through the skin feels so alien and Arnold has never heard of anything like it before and it makes his fear increase. The gnawing sound dies down and the snake-like form recedes and Arnold's chest soon looks normal again but he can feel a greater weight in his chest that he didn't feel before. The female customer pays and it is Arnold's turn to put his goods on the checkout belt.

Arnold puts his items on the checkout belt and stands in front of the clerk and he takes out his old worn out wallet and looks for the cash he has put in the wallet. The clerk smiles at Arnold. She recognizes him because he often shops here. Arnold takes out the cash and hands it to the clerk and starts walking towards the end of the checkout line.

Arnold's chest explodes and blood and small bitten off parts of the ribcage spray in all directions and in the middle of the chest among all the blood and internal body parts, a Chestburster appears. The chestburster screams its birth cry and starts to crawl out of Arnold's chest and it lands on the checkout belt. The soft rolls are crushed by the Chestburster's weight and the milk package also breaks and the milk starts to flow out over the checkout belt and is mixed with all the blood from Arnold and the Chestburster. Screaming in terror, the clerk jumps up from her chair and leaves the cash register, fleeing into the store, far away from the chestburster.

Today's first Chestburster is born but it won't be the last.

**Teresagatan (Michael's residence)**

Michael wakes up at 9 am and immediately gets out of bed and puts on his clothes and eats breakfast. Krister goes into Michael's apartment and takes out the money that Michael will take with him when he meets Sven. Krister is very quiet and doesn't greet Michael and Michael guesses that Krister is still mad at him for sneaking out of the residence and releasing the adult Alien monster. When Michael has finished eating his breakfast, he walks around the apartment and waits for 11 o'clock because Sven will pick him up then. Actually, Sven was supposed to pick him up already at 10 am, but Sven called and asked if he could pick him up at 11 am instead, and Michael thought that sounded like a good idea.

**Smågatan**

Right next to Teresagatan there is a smaller street called Smågatan and there are only two apartment buildings on the very short street and the gate to the first apartment building suddenly opens and a fair-haired younger woman comes out into the street and she starts walking towards Teresagatan. The woman's name is Kristina and she is 25 years old and she has just moved in three days ago. Kristina lived in Halmstad before but has chosen to move to Stockholm and so far she seems to be enjoying herself but Kristina has not made any friends so far.

**Teresagatan**

Kristina has now arrived at Teresagatan and she looks at her mobile phone as she walks forward along the street. Suddenly, Kristian walks straight onto an object standing on the street and she almost trips over it, but she manages to keep her balance. It is a large leathery object standing in the middle of the street and the top of the object looks almost like an ass but has four leaf like things around the top. Kristian snorts and chooses to go around the object but just as she passes it she sees the four leaf-like things open like a big flower and she turns and looks at the object.

Kristina can look down into the object and it looks very slimy and disgusting but she can also see a light shape moving inside the object and she becomes curious as to what it is and she walks closer to the mysterious object. The facehugger jumps out of the egg in a big explosion and the movement is so fast that Kristina doesn't have time to escape and she can't really see what is coming towards her. Kristina gets a confused impression of spider-like fingers stretched over a smaller grey-brown body. The facehugger lands on Kristina's face and when its inner skin meets hers, a chemical reaction occurs and she loses consciousness and falls to the ground. Michael is standing in his fourth floor apartment looking out the street from the living room window and sees Kristina being attacked by the facehugger but he is not going to run down to her and try to pull the beast away because he knows it won't work.

The facehugger thrusts its long proboscis through Kristina's mouth and it quickly moves down towards the throat and stops when it has reached far enough down. The proboscis swells to double its size and a few seconds later large quantities of small black eggs shoot out through the proboscis and they move purposefully towards Kristina's chest. The proboscis continues to eject hundreds of eggs for two minutes, but then relaxes and retracts into the facehuggers body. The Facehugger loosens his grip on Kristina's face and crawls along the street to find a place to die. Kristina wakes up after a few minutes and she gets up and continues walking along the street and she begins to approach the MeraMat store and Kristina has intended to shop there.

**Mariatorget**

42-year-old Olivia walks with rhythmic steps and she is on her way to the MeraMat store and she can already see the store's flag further down the street she is walking on. Olivia is red-haired and has extremely thick breasts, but she is very proud of them. The only problem is finding bras that fit her huge breasts but there are a few stores that have bras that big and MeraMat is one of the stores and that is one of the reasons why she is on her way to the store. The other reason is that she is going to buy some special waffle cones for ice cream that are only sold by MeraMat. Olivia doesn't really like ice cream but she loves eating these waffle cones.

Olivia looks in the shop windows that she passes but there are no shops that interest her. A little further down the street, there is a large dark brown leather-like object and Olivia's interest is piqued. Olivia thinks she recognizes the object but she can't quite remember where from and she approaches the object. When Olivia gets to the object she notices that it is very slimy and that the top looks like an ass and now she suddenly knows what it is. It's an egg from the movie Alien, Olivia laughs nervously and starts to walk away from the egg even though she knows that what happens in movies is pretend. Olivia has passed the egg and has it behind her when suddenly she hears a sticky sound behind her and she turns around. Olivia watches as the last two leaves on the egg open and she murmurs.

- No thanks, but thanks for the invitation.

The facehugger explodes out of the egg and it is at such high speed that it lands on Olivia's face a few seconds later and Olivia panics and tries to pull off the unwelcome intruder but when the slimy inside of the facehugger meets Olivia's skin a chemical reaction occurs and she loses consciousness and falls to the ground. Because Olivia has such heavy breasts, she falls forward and the facehugger almost comes off her face but it crawls further up her face. The facehugger thrusts its long proboscis through Olivia's open mouth and it moves down towards her throat. The proboscis is very slimy and slippery which means that it easily slides down the throat without problems.

When the proboscis has come down far enough, it swells to twice its size and soon hundreds of small black eggs shoot out through the proboscis and they quickly move down towards Olivia's chest. The force when the eggs come out of the proboscis is so great that the whole proboscis swings violently, but because it has swelled up, it cannot accidentally come up from the pharynx. The eggs squirt out through the proboscis for about two minutes but then they run out and the proboscis becomes limp again and is drawn into the body of the facehugger and only the end of it protrudes from the facehugger. The Facehugger loosens its grip on Olivia's face and crawls out into the street but accidentally crawls into the driveway and is run over by a car. The facehuggers body is crushed and the yellow blood spurts up from under the car and corrodes the gas tank. Gasoline spurts out from under the car, but the driver doesn't notice anything until his car stops further down the road.

Olivia wakes up after a few minutes and immediately starts flailing her arms to get the beast off her face but she soon notices that there is no beast on her face and she feels stupid. Olivia turns over so she's on her back and makes her way up from the street, brushing some grit off her shirt. Olivia looks suspiciously at the Alien egg and wonders if a facehugger really landed on her face. There are several people walking on the street nearby and they don't seem worried so Olivia thinks that maybe she just imagined a facehugger landing in the face. But the throat feels a little sore and it makes her a little worried after all. Olivia remembers very well what happens to facehugger victims and it's not something she wants to be a part of. Olivia continues to walk forward on the street and soon she arrives at MeraMat and enters the store. Kristina comes walking right after Olivia.

**Meramat**

Olivia goes straight to the bread shelf and so does Kristina. Kristina notices Olivia's thick breasts and grimaces because she thinks it looks so ugly with such thick breasts. Kristina, on the other hand, likes the color of Olivia's hair and she wishes she had been a redhead, but she is unfortunately a blonde and gets to hear a lot of blonde jokes.

Olivia looks for the waffle cones but can't find any. They are supposed to be of the Bato brand and there are others of the Vilgo brand but she wants the ones made by Bato because they are the best. Olivia sees an employee placing goods and she calls him over.

- Listen. Where are the waffle cones from Bato? I don't see them here.

- If they are not on the shelf, they are sold out. I have just restocked the bread shelf so I know there are none in stock.

- But seriously. How can they sell out?

- Maybe because our customers like them. It is possible that our shop in Hammarby has a few waffle cones left.

- Hammarby? It's quite far from here. I can't bear to go there.

- Well. I can't help you unfortunately.

Kristina reaches for a piece of bread that is close to where the waffle cones should be, but since Olivia is in the way, she doesn't manage to get hold of the bread and she clears her throat discreetly.

- Excuse me, can you just move a little so I can have a piece of bread?

Olivia grumbles sourly but moves so Kristina can take her bread and then she walks over to where the beauty products are because she knows there are big bras there. Olivia sees that there are three large bras left so she chooses them all and starts to walk towards the cash register and there is a long line because there is only one cash register open. There are probably 12 people ahead of Olivia and she gets annoyed that there is only one cash register open. The woman who stood at the cash register when the Chestburster was born from Arnold's chest is sitting in the coffee room talking to two police officers and a psychologist and that is the reason why only one cash register is open. Kristina has collected her goods and stands behind Olivia.

Kristina feels a strong movement in her chest and she gasps and staggers backwards but manages to regain her balance. Olivia hears Kristina gasp and she turns to see that Kristina seems okay so she doesn't need to help her and Olivia turns again and stomps on the floor impatiently. What makes it take so incredibly long?

Suddenly, a gnawing sound is heard from Olivia's chest and she wonders where the sound is coming from but soon realizes that it is coming from her own chest and she slaps one hand hard against her chest and the sound disappears. The person standing in front of Olivia also seems to have heard the sound and turns to look at Olivia suspiciously and Olivia sees that this customer has three of Bato's waffle cones in her cart and she points to the waffle cones.

- Hey. Can I have one of those? They are completely out of stock.

- No, you can't. My children are having an ice cream party today.

- And then you need all three of these? There are 12 waffle cones in each package.

- I know, but there are over 30 children who will come to the party, so I have to buy so many.

Olivia swears silently and the customer turns around and she doesn't seem to want to stand in line either. The gnawing sound is heard again and Olivia slaps her hand against her chest, but this time the sound doesn't go away but gets stronger. Suddenly, Olivia's chest hurts so much that she sees stars in front of her eyes and is close to fainting, and she positions herself so that her body leans against a shelf in case she faints.

In the meantime, Kristina feels continuous strong movements in her chest and she moans loudly because the movements make her whole chest hurt. Kristian's chest is pushed out by something and she stares at her protruding chest and begins to hyperventilate. Two younger guys come behind Kristina and they see her protruding chest and are unsure if they want to stand so close to this girl. The two guys have heard about the advance of the Alien monsters and they wonder if an Alien will be born from this girl's chest and they don't want to get too close if thats the case. Kristina's chest is normal again and she is grateful for that but a few seconds later her chest are pushed out again and this time a snake-like shape is visible through the skin on the chest and Kristina also sees the shape but she does not want to believe her eyes.

The younger guys can also see the shape and quickly retreat.

- Shit. She has an Alien in her chest that is about to be born. What the hell are we going to do?

- I don't know. Maybe we should warn the others in the queue.

- I'm not going to go near that girl. The alien monster might jump out of her chest and land on me.

- I think that maybe we can tell an employee and they can warn the others in the queue.

Olivia's chest hurts less and she moves and stands behind the customer with the waffle cones. The gnawing sound is no longer heard from Olivias chest, but on the other hand, the breasts feel heavier than they usually do. Suddenly Olivia's chest explodes in a huge geyser of blood and loose body parts and the blood splashes on the back of the customer standing in front of Olivia and she turns around and gets lots of blood on her face. Olivia looks down at her chest and sees something start to push out from it and it takes a few seconds before she realizes it's a Chestburster. Olivia has such thick breasts that the Chestburster has a hard time getting out of her chest. Olivia dies and her body begins to fall forward and the Chestburster crawls out of her chest seconds before the body lands on the ground with a loud thud.

At the same time as Olivia's body lands on the floor, Kristina's chest explodes in a smaller geyser of blood and smaller body parts and the Chestburster has such high power when it is born that it pops out of the chest and lands on the floor. The chestburster lets out his birth cry and it is heard throughout most of the store and some customers who are over at the milk turn around and wonder what that shrill sound is coming from. The two younger guys can see the Chestburster pop out of Kristina's chest and land on the floor, but they can also see the Chestburster that came out of Olivia's chest start to move into the store and approach them.

- But wait a minute, there's another one. So there are two Alien monsters that have been born. But they can't come from the same person.

- The other probably comes from the red-haired lady lying on the floor. There is a lot of blood flowing around her body

- In a way, this is really cool.

- No, it's not cool at all. It's terrible. Think of the poor ladies.

- Well, at least they won't suffer any more.

Both chestbursters move further into the store and an employee spots them and he runs into a storage room and gets a very sharp knife and he hopes to kill the two monsters. The employee re-enters the store and he holds the sharp knife in a firm grip and watches as the two chestbursters approach him. The employee pushes the knife hard into the first chestburster and a large hole is made in the monster's skin and the yellow blood spurts out in bursts as it moves forward. The blood lands both on the floor and several goods, and the floor and the goods begin to be corroded by the blood. The employee pulls the knife from the chestburster's body but a few drops of its yellow blood lands on his hand and begins to corrode his hand.

The employee screams in pain but presses the knife into the second chestburster, leaving a large hole in its skin. The yellow blood spurts right up into the employee's face and he is immediately blinded and his face smokes heavily. Some of the yellow blood splashes onto the employee's chest and stomach and his heart explodes as the blood corrodes it. Both chestbursters die after a while but the employee is also dead but he died as a hero and that means a lot to the employees who will mourn him.

1g8marj,https://www.reddit.com/r/dpdr/comments/1g8marj/i_worry_my_life_is_passing_me_by_and_i_cant_get/,"I worry my life is passing me by, and I can’t get any of this time back.","The more time I spend in DPDR, the more I realize how I'm missing out on what truly makes life worth living. I don't even have anxiety anymore, completely calm. I don't believe that DPDR is only anxiety based - I think severe trauma basically trains the brain to fear everything beyond a point a normal mind can handle. When the fear becomes of your own emotions and reactions, you've reached a point most others will never reach.

I can't imagine ever having a normal life again. You can read in my posts how far I've come and for that I'm very grateful / proud of myself, to keep going. But I am so far detached from myself and emotions, when I think about myself - and how I remember experiencing life as me, it's mind blowing how far I am away from me. I don't experience the visual distortions, I don't look at my hands and wonder if they're mine, I don't panic, I don't have intrusive thoughts about existence or reality. I can't relate to most posts on here anymore. I'm just nobody. I'm living someone else's life and in an upside down of my own life. I don't feel anything, emotionally or physically. All my memories and sense of self are gone. I've overcome my agoraphobia , I've just allowed myself to be and accept this is my life, I don't fight my symptoms or avoid anything. From the outside, you'd think I'm 100%normal based on how normally I live. But I'm anything but that. I feel like I'm just watching life pass me by with no involvement, connection or feelings. I remember waking up on a Friday and having that weekend feeling, that excitement and joy. Morning coffee. Going out dancing. Traveling. Reading. Meeting new people. Playing with my dog. Having sex. It all meant something. It all felt real and vibrant. It all felt like my life and the life I always experienced since I was a kid.

I've tried everything. I've worked on my anxiety and just being with it in utter acceptance. Nothing changes the fact that I'm disembodied, numb, dissociated 24/7, I don't even remember what sensations feel like, what emotions feel like, what my sense of self was like. Over time, I've lost my ability to remember those things, so I'm truly a completely different person now. I get really tired of being told to just focus on life - to just give it time, to just know it's only anxiety. I had anxiety my entire life. This isn't anxiety - it's indescribable. The color and vibrancy of life has been drained from me. The feeling of a holiday, of morning time, of a rainy day, of a summer evening - all has left me. I am not connected, physically or emotionally to anything or anyone, even my own dog. I don't recognize her as ""my dog"" anymore even, most of the time I wonder why I have this creature living in my home.

The incredibly sad part is that life is always so short, I learned this when my mom died, and I'm just wasting it. Even though I do things and live normally - it's like for nothing. There's nothing to feel or experience. I am unable to make new memories, retrieve old ones, connect or learn new things. Medications, therapy, staying busy, working - none of it has brought me back. I told my therapist I want to take a break from therapy too because I just don't have it in me anymore to keep talking anout the same things over and over, with nothing improving. My mind has shut off any emotion, any connection, any sense of self, any feeling or personality, it's so beyond difficult. I can remember my life for 29 years, it was never this. It was full of such meaning, complexity, connection and emotions. I am just a soulless human being who tries to survive each day, but I lost hope a long time ago. When you wake up each day and feel like more of yourself is gone, slowly fading into black - you're going to stop having hope. What human loses all their emotions and can't even feel anxiety anymore? No doctor or theorist really understands this. It's a complete loss of you, of your world. My mind has wiped the hard drive and left me to just suffer with this. I'm not quite sure how this is protecting me, my own mind has ruined my life - and for what? I don't know how I can ever regain all that I've lost, and that is so so so painful. I don't think many are at this point where they've lost their sense of self completely, even their ability to feel anxiety is gone. It's just unimaginable. My whole life I worked to become someone, and I was so proud, so happy. I overcame all the obstacles in my way, but life walloped me with this and now I don't even know what my life is going to look like having to live this way. I've come so far, I've worked my ass off - but not for one second have I returned to feeling like me, to feeling connected. All I've done is get over my fear of the anxious feelings and thoughts, but my mind has detached from everything. I have horrible dreams every night - there's not one moment of escape or reality for me, this has been my life for 2 years and it's just really sad. I don't want to be 40 years old and still feeling this way, I'm 32 and have my whole life ahead of me. But I'm just stuck on this merry go round that leads to nowhere. How can you live life when sex, money, love, ambition, connection, foods, success, jealousy, anger, grief - no longer mean anything. I am living in a black and white tv show while everyone else is in 4K color.",2,1729506012.0,dpdr,1,1.0,False
