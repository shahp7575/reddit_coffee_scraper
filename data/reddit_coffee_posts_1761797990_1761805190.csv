Someone easy to talk to and, if we match, down to spend more time together. I‚Äôm not into smokers , I could be fine with vaping, but definitely not cigarettes or any drugs.
Some info about me: I‚Äôm a good talker & texter, willing to be a good phone caller as well. I‚Äôm into night walks and walking by the sea. I play a little on my PC, used to be a movie lover, love making jokes to fix our crazy days, and got pretty good taste in music.
I love deep and critical thinking to understand the origins and outcomes of ideas.
I've tried Tinder but uhh not that good , Tried uni guys, and it was a waste of time. I'm not that 35yo guy who sits up in a coffee shop the whole night waiting for his angel to come.. Would love to get your ideas , I know there are a few cool guys around just help me find them or maybe you‚Äôre the unexpected twist in this story ‚ôæÔ∏è

I (52f) and hubby (53m) have been married 18 yrs. We had some major issues about 1.5 yrs ago and he went to jail for domestic violence.Itvwas a harrowing experience but we toughed it out with tears and heartache.  He is now sober, yay. We are together. He is very active in AA and I have observed three different women by trying to 13th step with him but he's been clueless.  I mean completely clueless, then realized it after I pointed it out.  The most recent woman he was texting, it was many times a day, with a lot of joking but not really flirting going on. She is married as well. I saw the numerous texts and call history back and forth. I believe him when he says they are just friends. He asked me if I wanted him to cease all contact with this woman. I told him I was not that kind of jealous person but he needed to follow the two rules in our marriage: avoid even the appearance of impropriety. Second, if you wouldn't want me to do that, don't do it. Fast forward a week later after our discussion. She asked him to lunch and he declined, proudly told me about it. The day after our anniversary when he didn't get me a gift, other woman convinces him to leave his AA meeting early and bring her a coffee because she couldn't find a coffee maker at the school where she was subbing. (Note this school houses over 2k student and I've worked there. ..coffee is everywhere.) I saw the message and immediately...pissed off! We are having a big debate about this. I sent her a message when I was pissed and said that she could have him if she wanted him. I also said she should know what he did to me last year, meaning the domestic violence. My husband called me and I told him that I knew about the coffee delivery. I was so mad and he was speechless, said he thought it was odd she asked. I told him I was ma. He was mad and thought I overstepped my bounds, even though he had told me again to contact her about the innocent coffee delivery. My husband is either practicing his manipulation, having an affair, or is he legit completely oblivious?

1ojrw1z,https://www.reddit.com/r/PinoyUnsentLetters/comments/1ojrw1z/an_open_letter_to_the_one_who_stayed/,An Open Letter to the One Who Stayed,"Hi.

I'm not exactly sure why I'm writing this tonight.

But today, I sat across from one of my student counselees. She was talking about a friend who had been there for her during the hardest time in her life. Someone who reminded her that she mattered, that she wasn't alone, even when she couldn't see that for herself.

And somehow, as I was nodding and holding space for her, I found myself thinking of you.

I think there's always been a part of me that believes I owe you an apology.
And maybe even more than that - a thank you.

Funny how time works. It's been what? 7? 8 years? And truthfully, we're probably no more familiar to each other now than two strangers passing on the street.

But you were never just anyone to me.

You were one of the few people I trusted with the truest parts of myself.
You came into my life when I didn‚Äôt even want to be in it.

I've known you since 8th grade.
You didn't really know me until 9th.
Still from that point, I knew you were one of the good ones.

The steady ones
.
The kind ones.

I had a fun little crush on you back then‚Ä¶
Quiet and shy and tucked somewhere in between poems and love letters
and even glances across the room.

But it wasn‚Äôt our time.

And little did we know‚Ä¶ it would never be our time.

Not really.

Not in the way I once hoped.

But that didn‚Äôt make what we had any less real. Or less meaningful.

Some people don‚Äôt need to stay forever to leave something lasting.

And you did.

You always will.

Years passed. And then, life gave us another chance.
We reconnected. And we tried.
We tried so hard.

And I tried... for you.

I tried to show up. I tried to be enough.
I wanted to be the kind of person you deserved.
I wanted to be someone whole.

But I wasn't okay.

Not then.

I was in a kind of darkness I wouldn't wish on anyone.

Severely depressed. Anxious. Constantly locking myself inside the university bathroom stalls.

Dissociating. Losing chunks of time, walking around like I was outside of my own life.

Some days I'd look at the sky and wonder if it would be easier to just... stop.

There were nights where I would fall asleep wondering if I'd even care to wake up.

And somehow, in all that, you stayed.

You showed up.
You supported me.
You said you'd wait.
You told me I could get through it.
That I didn‚Äôt have to do it alone.
That we‚Äôll get help.

At one point, it truly felt like you were the only good thing in my life.
And I wanted to keep that goodness for as long as I could.

But the more I clung to it... the more I clung to you... the more I realized how unfair it was.

You didn‚Äôt deserve to carry someone else‚Äôs brokenness on top of your own.

So I did the hardest thing I could.
I let you go.

Not because I didn‚Äôt care.
But because I cared too much.

You were the best thing I had.
You were my best friend.
And I felt like I had to protect you from the wreckage that I had become.

I told you that I wasn't even sure if I wanted to get better.

And that was the truth back then.

I was tired. Lost. Hopeless.

I don't remember much from those days.
My brain was a fog I couldn't clear.

But I remember you.

I remember the walks down the Blue Mountain.
God, I hated walking but it was the only time we got to spend some time together.

I remember the way you'd scold me for drinking too much coffee.

The late-night calls where I'd start to doze off and you'd let me rest.

You called me Panda because I was always sleepy and could fall asleep anywhere.

I remember the books you lent me. Anna and the French Kiss is still one of my faves.

You were patient when I didn't know how to speak.
You were gentle when I didn't know how to ask for help.

You were the first person I ever told about my dream of opening a coffee shop. You told me I could do it before I ever believed it myself.
I haven't done it yet. But who knows. Maybe someday.

I even remember that last time we saw each other.

An empty classroom on the 6th floor of my building.

It was my breaking point.
I lost hope altogether in front of you.

That's when I decided to push you away... but you didn‚Äôt run.

You saved me.
Not metaphorically... literally.

You were the one who could pull me back when I started to spiral.
You‚Äôd say something ridiculous just to make me laugh.
Something small, something stupid.
Even if laughing felt like a foreign language in my mouth.

You gave me something to hold onto.

I wrote for you back then.
You inspired words out of me I didn‚Äôt know I had.

Poems, letters poured out of me endlessly.

There was a time I thought I wouldn't be able to write again if I didn‚Äôt have you.

Because you were the one good thing.
My muse. My safe space.

But I write again now.

It was a lot of hard work, but I eventually found my way back to myself.
Back to silver linings in ordinary days.
Back to my voice.

I still write about love and life and pain but my poems aren‚Äôt as dark anymore.
There‚Äôs light in them now.
And you're still in there, somewhere.
Not as a wound.
But as a warm, quiet memory.

You were part of the reason I made it through.

Oh! I also became a counselor.

Wild, isn't it?

I used to think I was the last person who should be guiding anyone.
But I chose this path because I wanted to be the person I wish I had when I was barely holding on.

I sit across from young people now, and I see myself in them.

And I stay.

Because you once stayed for me.

And I'm not saying all these to make anything weird.
Or to reopen something we‚Äôve long left behind.

I'm saying it because you deserve to hear it.

Thank you.

Thank you for loving me when I didn‚Äôt know how to love myself.

Thank you for staying.

Thank you for being a light.

I carry you with me.
In the poems. In the stories.
In the way I show up for others.
In the way I stay.

This is my long-overdue letter.
Not to fix anything.
Not to change the past.
Just to say: Thank you.

Through the years...
I've lived.
I've loved.
I've gotten my heart broken.
I've loved again.
And I've learned so much.

I don‚Äôt regret loving anymore.
I don‚Äôt regret being soft. Or kind.

Yes, things can change.
Yes, people leave.
But I don‚Äôt want to have regrets.
Not when love is still one of the most beautiful things I‚Äôve ever experienced, even if it sometimes hurts.

I live now.

I don‚Äôt wake up every morning searching for all the reasons not to exist.

I go to a job I love.

I don't drink as much coffee as before, but I still like it strong and sweet.

I spend time with people who make me laugh.

I made peace with my family.

I fill my days with meaning. With color.

I'm here.

I made it.

And if I haven‚Äôt said it before; I‚Äôm sorry.

I‚Äôm sorry for the hurt I caused.

For pushing you away when all you wanted to do was stay.

For the confusion, for the silence, for the weight I placed on your heart when I was still trying to carry my own.

Back then, I thought I was doing the right thing by letting you go.
But that doesn‚Äôt mean it didn‚Äôt hurt you.
And for that, I carry a quiet ache.

You didn‚Äôt deserve the way things ended.
You didn‚Äôt deserve to love someone who didn‚Äôt have the capacity to receive it fully.

I was in survival mode.

You didn‚Äôt fail me.
I just wasn‚Äôt ready to be loved the way you loved me.

And if someone asked me if I'd do it all over again?

Probably, yes.

As much as it hurt.

As sad as it ended.

But now, I've made peace with it.
Because I think that heartbreak was the turning point.

The start of everything I needed to become.

Just like the last time we spoke, I still carry that same wish for you.

I hope you found someone who truly sees you for who you are.
The quiet strength, the depth, the heart that shows up even when it's hard.

Someone who loves you as much as you love them.

Because knowing you‚Ä¶ you love hard.

You're all in.

And that kind of love deserves to be returned, fully, faithfully.

I hope you have all the good things.
The kind of peace that feels like home.
The kind of laughter that feels like healing.

I hope you're achieving the dreams you once told me about. Or maybe chasing new ones. Bigger, braver ones.

I hope life‚Äôs been kind to you.
But more than that, I hope you‚Äôve been kind to yourself.

Because if anyone deserves goodness, it's you.

So wherever you are‚Ä¶
I hope you're happy.

I hope you found someone who gives you what you always gave so freely.

I hope you take her to the moon for me.

I hope you are loved. Deeply. Gently.

Because you were always the easiest person to love.

Take care.

I'll carry the memory of your kindness with me, always.

With all the gratitude I never had the chance to say out loud but always carried in my heart,

BEST PART : we own this unit! So can DIY a bit and add things (probably obvious due to the cat-wall LOL)

Has the wifi/intercom/AC stuff, a PowerPoint at the bottom so useful spot, we dont have a dining table due to space so this is a fill in but so small we just eat at our fold up coffee table instead so could probably get rid of it but I like to have a cup of tea there in the mornings hahaha so a seat would be nice

Lots of books/recipes etc, some craft stuff i can condense/sell lmao and of course my plants! 

Maybe a mix of storage/ fold out table bit? Would LOVE suggestions to specific furniture styles that would work here, or even if I add shelves ? Maybe not because its an electricity dense wall ü´†

During our junior of college we decided to look at moving off campus with our other two friends. Me and my other friend we can call Lily, went on apartment tours. We visited our first one we really liked but decided to keep looking. Our friend Rose was adamant on living in the apartment complex her boyfriend was living in at the time. But it was completely out of budget and the rooms were extremely small. We told her that the location wasn‚Äôt our favorite but we were still going on tours. She freaked out that we like the first place and was very stubborn on the location. Side note: we also wanted to sign our leases early so it wouldn‚Äôt be extremely expensive. Anyways, we keep going on tours. A few weeks later, Rose tells us that she‚Äôs going to live at her boyfriend‚Äôs parents house, they have a private apartment area. I asked her if she was sure because it was about to be leasing time and that me, lily, and our friend Azalea had to start looking at 3x3 options. I kept asking her up until leasing time if she was positive that she wasn‚Äôt going to live with us and she said she was sure. We signed our leases without her and that was the end of that. Fast forward to our senior year of college. Rose‚Äôs boyfriend breaks up with her. Luckily she wasn‚Äôt kicked out of her living situation, but she didn‚Äôt want to be alone there. Which valid. So she was over at my apartment everyday for a month where I was there for her, hung out, consoled her and more. That‚Äôs when she starts bringing up that I left her out of the apartment and signed the lease without telling her anything. That we ditched her when she was in the loop the entire time! I have a birthday party with some of the friends, and I introduce her to people that didn‚Äôt know her and she starts telling people that I left her out and I was a bad friend and that I made her feel like the only choice was to live at her boyfriend‚Äôs parents house. I literally have screenshots like it‚Äôs absolutely crazy. I didn‚Äôt want to cause a scene at the party but it made very uncomfortable. She starts telling people this and I‚Äôm like hey this didn‚Äôt happen and she says no y‚Äôall told me nothing. This fizzles out until later we‚Äôre driving  out for an emergency where I‚Äôm sick when out of nowhere she looks at me and goes ‚ÄúI hate you, we‚Äôre too similar and I just hate you sometimes, and I‚Äôm very pissed at you‚Äù then she starts laughing but I‚Äôm so taken back. I felt so uncomfortable cus I was stuck in the car. And I was like why and she didn‚Äôt answer me back. Later we go bar hopping when she goes to our acquaintance and tell her ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt hate you yet, but I will soon. We‚Äôre very similar like ‚Äúme‚Äù I‚Äôm pissed at her and hate her‚Äù when my  acquaintance told me I was shocked. I don‚Äôt know what I did to her. I was there for her through everything. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I‚Äôm stubborn but I‚Äôm not rude. I decided to have a conversation with her at a coffee place to bring up the housing thing and her telling me and others that she hates me. But I wanted to know if I‚Äôm a asshole for perhaps putting a boundary and say I don‚Äôt want to be friends anymore because I feel disrespected and hurt, and ask why she wants to be friends with me if she hates me? Like I‚Äôll apologize if I did something but I can‚Äôt think of what I did. I mean I‚Äôve been busy with grad school apps but I still make time for her? Pls let me know if I am an asshole pls!!

Modern guides ‚Äî especially those written by corporations or AI platforms ‚Äî often treat ‚Äúidea generation‚Äù and ‚Äúbrainstorming‚Äù as if they‚Äôre the same thing. They‚Äôre not. Both aim to produce new ideas, but they operate on completely different principles.

**Idea generation** is a process of *extraction*.  
**Brainstorming** is a process of *emergence.*

In idea generation, you ask for ideas and collect them. In brainstorming, you create the *conditions* where ideas collide, mutate, and evolve.

# Brainstorming: Associative and Evolving

Brainstorming, by contrast, is **associative and dynamic.**  
The power of a brainstorm comes from *interplay* ‚Äî how one idea triggers another, how logic gets suspended long enough for intuition to speak, and how nonsense can suddenly make sense when paired with something else.

Example (real or simulated):

Goal: *‚ÄúFind new ways to attract customers to a local bakery.‚Äù*

Person 1: ‚ÄúWarm smells ‚Äî maybe open the vents toward the street.‚Äù  
Person 2: ‚ÄúSmells‚Ä¶ aroma branding ‚Äî what if the bakery sold its scent as a candle?‚Äù  
Person 3: ‚ÄúCandles ‚Äî that‚Äôs seasonal! A ‚Äòbakery at home‚Äô kit with the smell and a small recipe.‚Äù  
Person 4: ‚ÄúWhat if you could *bake the candle*? A candle that turns into edible sugar once it melts.‚Äù

Now we‚Äôre not just listing ‚Äî we‚Äôre building. The ‚Äúwrong‚Äù idea (sell the scent) collided with another (home kits) and produced something novel (a candle that becomes food). That *interaction* is the essence of brainstorming.

Brainstorming is about **emergence** ‚Äî ideas that didn‚Äôt exist in any participant‚Äôs head until the conversation started moving.

It‚Äôs like weather: one gust interacts with another until lightning strikes.

Why the Confusion Matters

When companies or AI platforms redefine brainstorming as ‚Äúmaking lists,‚Äù they remove the one ingredient that makes it powerful: *unpredictable interaction.* Lists collect; brainstorming *creates.*

That‚Äôs why you can run a perfect ‚Äúidea generation session‚Äù and still end up uninspired ‚Äî all the ideas are neat, logical, and separate. True brainstorming feels different. It‚Äôs fast, slightly chaotic, and sometimes uncomfortable, because you don‚Äôt know where it‚Äôs going. But that‚Äôs what produces the leap ‚Äî not refinement, but collision.

# The Difference Between Idea Generation and Brainstorming

Idea generation is a process of extraction.  
Brainstorming is a process of emergence.

In idea generation, you ask for ideas and collect them. In brainstorming, you create the conditions where ideas collide, mutate, and evolve.

# Idea Generation: Linear and Isolated

Idea generation is a linear, selective process. You ask for a list of possibilities, and the system ‚Äî or your own mind ‚Äî gives you discrete, finished entries. Each stands alone, like cards laid out on a table.

Example:

>

You‚Äôll get results like:

1. Start a loyalty program.
2. Offer free samples on weekends.
3. Collaborate with local coffee shops.
4. Launch a seasonal cupcake flavor.
5. Host baking workshops.

Useful? Yes. But it‚Äôs mechanical. You could ask the same question tomorrow and get ten slightly different ideas, none of which depend on or build from the others.

Idea generation is about coverage ‚Äî exploring the space of possibilities. It‚Äôs good for when you need options, categories, or inspiration, but it doesn‚Äôt produce unexpected connections.

It‚Äôs like fishing with a net ‚Äî you catch what‚Äôs already swimming near the surface.

Dear Sir,  
When i leave my house i intend to return to it safe and sound. Please in the name of all that you hold dear to you i say be careful, drive safe. If you know you will be making an exit please plan ahead. the 1 minute you are trying to save by cutting across numerous lanes at 80+ km/h could end the lives of a family. Yes you have a big expensive car and will probably win in the courts (if we are alive to get to the courts) but remember the roads don't belong to you. If the bus ahead of you stepped on his brakes even a little all three of us and possible many others would have been in a bad situation because or your impatience and recklessness.

I started experimenting with something small: matching people based on *psychology and vibe compatibility*, then directly suggesting a local caf√© or event to meet. Basically skipping all the swiping and ghosting.

It‚Äôs been surprisingly fun to test ‚Äî a few small groups have already met up for coffee or a book club in SF / South Bay.

Curious how others here prefer to meet new people around the Bay?  
Do you usually go to events, use apps, or rely on friends-of-friends?

1ojrcl6,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojrcl6,I actually am getting pretty fascinated by freeway running buses.,"Honestly I think these are quite good, and allows for public transit to easily make use of the ‚Äúfreeway investment‚Äù‚Ä¶we know that freeways aren‚Äôt going to go away anytime soon, so we should start making more use of them by running transit up and down them!

I decided to try out our local freeway bus and I am quite amazed. (Phoenix, Valley Metro)The stop is quite nice, and there‚Äôs NextBus displays, and they really did try to make this an ‚Äúelevated‚Äù experience. I hope to see more buses during the middle of the day and offering services outside of commute hours. Supposedly there is a study to do this and turn the I-17 route into something like the LA Metro J line.

And as for that I-17 bus I mentioned earlier? I actually used it to go grab lunch from downtown, I took it from downtown to the Thelda Williams transit center, took the train back downtown, and hung out at a coffee shop for a bit, and then took the SR-51 bus back to my car. I was quite surprised I was able to use the freeway buses in this capacity to be able to grab lunch. Most of the time, these are scheduled based on office worker times, but I was happy to see the increased frequency on the I-17 route. If only it ran the other direction‚Ä¶.

I usually feel tired in the afternoon and wanted something to help me focus and stay active without drinking too much coffee. These sticks dissolve easily in water and taste pretty light ‚Äî I was surprised by how natural they feel.

Each stick contains:
	‚Ä¢	L-Carnitine ‚Äì helps support metabolism and energy production.
	‚Ä¢	Caffeine ‚Äì for alertness and focus (not too strong).
	‚Ä¢	B-Vitamins (B6, B12) ‚Äì to reduce fatigue and support normal energy levels.
	‚Ä¢	Green tea extract & guarana ‚Äì natural sources of antioxidants and energy.

After about 15‚Äì20 minutes, I notice a clean boost of energy ‚Äî no jitters, no crash. It helps me stay productive, especially on long workdays.

Of course, it‚Äôs not a substitute for rest or a balanced diet, but it‚Äôs a good supplement when you need that extra push.

Has anyone else tried L-Carnitine-based energy drinks or similar products? Would love to hear your thoughts.

I'd read the book few months ago and for the first time I did cold approach to a young pretty girl (i was nervous as fuck but I am glad I did). Here are some really confusing things for me that's really making me confused.   
  
So I approached this girl and asked for her instagram. Instead she said I can't give you mine but I can give you my friend's (she was with her that time) and I sent her follow. 

After a while, she messaged me from her friend's account and we talked like for hours with a little bit of flirting. She was very open (which is again making me confused what kind of girl she is). I asked for a coffee date but she says her parents are strict (especially her brother) which is why is not using her account to talk to me and can't meet in the city too (tier 3 small city). I asked I can come to where she is completing her graduation , again she denied saying she live in hostel so it's impossible there. 

But then she said, we can meet tomorrow at the same place where I approached her. I asked if we can go for a drive but then she denies again (i didn't ask the reason this time). 

  
NOW the thing is.. she is pretty cute and I want her to think about me, want her to see myself as strong masculine man who doesn't give a fuck (although I guess I do). I am talking to many other girls online dating so shouldn't be that hard. But this girl, I want me on her mind.

It should be noted that my 10 year old is a very picky eater, and lactose intolerant. This mostly affected our food experiences in Japan and although we were able to accommodate, it was a major focus of the trip and I would have loved to have known beforehand options for food. 

Day 0 - Delta Flight from Seattle, WA to Haneda. Packed a BUNCH of food because the meal options were not things my 10 year old would eat, or had dairy. He ate all the things we packed. 7 year old was the only one who slept. Customs at Haneda was about 1.5 hours long. We had to go through extra security due to my 7 year old looking way different than his passport picture (he was 5 in the picture). We looked for the Suica card machine but didn't find it because everyone was overwhelmed and tired and wanted to be done. Ubered to our Air BnB in Nakano City. The AirBnb was perfect, within walking distance (about 4 blocks) of the train station, McDonalds, two 7-11s, two Family Markets, a grocery store and a bunch of restaurants. We literally only slept and showered there, so can't talk about the restaurants. We had McDonalds for dinner (you can get pancakes or chicken nuggets all day, the kids enjoyed being able to pick their own toy as well). 

Day 1 - Tokyo. Up really early, but nothing was open so got pastries at one of the 7-11s for breakfast. Found a Suica card machine in Shinjuku station so acquired cards there. Walked to the Don Quixote in Shinjuku then back to the train for the SkyTree and mall there. We did the Pokemon Center (and the Pokemon Friends game) for a while. This was the only Pokemon Center of the three that had the location exclusive Pikachu (with Sky Tree) and was the least chaotic that we visited. Spent some time looking at the other stores nearby. We walked a few blocks away to Gusto and enjoyed the food options and cat robots that delivered the food for lunch. Also stopped by Mr Donut for breakfast the next day. Ghibli store, Skytree, Tea Ceremony experience and then decided to go to Akihabara for the first Gatchaball store. Found Shogun Burger nearby, which had delicious burgers. (7.3 miles walked, mentioning because kids and adults were TIRED).

Day 2 - DisneySea! This was a great day and not being Disney people, we loved it. The typhoon was coming so today was super windy. Not sure if it was the weather or day (Thursday) but it wasn't too crowded walking around. We used the DPA for Toy Story, Tower of Terror, and Soaring. Journey to the Center of the Earth and Indiana Jones were closed. We had fun trying the churros and popcorn and the Halloween decor was great. Picky eater had a hot dog from the NY Hot Dog stand. Something to note: they don't have a ton of kids apparel at the park. My 7 year old got car sick taking a taxi there and needed a new shirt. They had either baby/toddler sizes clothes or adult clothes, with the exception of some Halloween stuff further in the park. We ended up getting him an adult small Duffy sweatshirt, which worked for the day, but was huge. (8.1 miles walked)

Day 3 - Hakone. Pastries from 7-11 for breakfast. We had tickets for the RomanceCar from Shinjuku and purchase the Hakone Free Pass for traveling within Hakone. We took the old train up the mountain, which was cool with the switchbacks. Our goal was the Open Air Museum and the kids loved it. There was a little cafe there, where we had snacks. We took at taxi to Pub Stop Pizza and Bar because they had dairy free cheese! It's behind the Gora Brewery and serve their beers. This is one of the times that GoogleMaps failed us, as it took us to a less busy cable car station after lunch. Unfortunately, that meant that it was packed and we couldn't get on. We walked a few blocks to the start and was able to get on. Took the cable car to the Ropeway and stopped at Owakudani. We didn't leave the Ropeway station area because we realized that time was getting short and that the Pirate Ship had a last sailing of 5pm. We were super anxious but made it on the last sailing, which was delayed and left at 5:10. Jumped onto the bus back to the train station. It was hard to find somewhere to eat on google so we ended up walking back streets to a Lawsons to get food. So we had our convenience store dinner, and ended up passing several open restaurants that weren't showing up on Google on the way back to the station. (6 miles walked, even with all the time on transportation)

Day 4 - Tokyo. McDonalds for breakfast. Making of Harry Potter Tour. We spent right about 4 hours there. We ate lunch at the cafe at the half way point. We enjoyed the Butterbeer, popcorn and all three dessert options. Train to Sunshine City for the Pokemon Center, where they were sold out of the location Pikachu (chef Pikachu). Pokemon Friends game was here as well so spent some time there. Huge Gatchaball area in lower level so got a bunch for souvenirs. This day was rainy and unlike Seattle, everyone uses umbrellas! Ended up finding another Shogun Burger place to eat dinner. (5.6 miles walked)

Day 5 - Kamakura. Pastries from 7-11 for breakfast. Took local transportation to Kamakura instead of a RomanceCar this time. Unbeknownst to us, even with research, this weekend was a holiday weekend so Kamakura was PACKED. Visited Kotoku-In and waited to meet some friends who are stationed in Japan and coming for a visit. Found a shaved ice place that included Pokemon Cards with purchase and had diary free options (Costa Coffee). We stopped there and then walked a little bit off the main street for lunch. We stopped at Ramen Hanabi, which was delicious and my picky 10 year old ate his kids Ramen. This is one of those placed that only has 10 seats so we waited a bit, but it was worth it. We visited the Hasadera afterwards with our friends and then headed back to the AirBnb. We stopped at the grocery store nearby, for dinner food and food for the next day/airplane ride. (5.3 miles walked)

Day 6 - Tokyo and home. Grocery store breakfast. We wanted to visit one last Pokemon Center, so we headed to Shibuya...with all of our luggage. Accidentally walked the Shibuya Scramble with all of our luggage because the storage lockers were not in the same station as the one we arrived in . That was fun! Dropped our luggage and went on an adventure to get the to Pokemon center, which involved elevators only going to Starbucks, the mall not being open and then walking through the Nintendo Store. This Pokemon Center was also out of the exclusive Pikachu (graffiti Pikachu) but does have the design a shirt area. We didn't have time to wait for the shirt (wait in line, plus an hour for it to be printed). This location also did not have the Pokemon Friends game, which the kids wanted to play one last time. We did find a Gatchaball/Claw Machine store that had the game, so they got a few last rounds in. We took a taxi back to Haneda, where we visited the Pokemon vending machine (also no exclusive Pikachu...Pilot Pikachu), finally stopped in a Uniqlo and attempted to get dairy free cheese pizza again. The place in the airport only had frozen, premade pizzas, and the vegan one included lots of veggies that weren't able to be picked off. So hot dog it was for the picky kid and we were off to fly home. 7 year old was the only one who slept again on the way back. Longest Monday EVER with the time travel back in time (3.7 miles walked).

We all had a blast. If we plan another trip, we'll wait until 10 year old will eat more things, and spend more time outside Tokyo/pop culture. Even the frustrating parts (mostly GoogleMaps fails and so much time on trains) added to the lovely experience. And the kids rocked it!",1,1761800196.0,JapanTravel,3,1.0,False

You might think Invisalign is a ""24-7 prison"" for your teeth. 

**Not true.**

I'm Dr. Tracy from SMILE-FX, your go-to orthodontic & clear aligner studio in South Florida. I've been shifting smiles for a long time, and I see the same questions every day. 

Let's get real.

---

## CAN YOU REALLY GO 4 HOURS A DAY WITHOUT THEM?

Okay, do you have to wear your aligners every second? **No!** 

Official advice is 20-22 hours a day, and at SMILE-FX, I set our patients up for 20-hour success from day one. That means you can snack, drink coffee, and yes, kids can even take them out for big class speeches‚Äî*without guilt*. 

You're not a prisoner. 

Check out our [""Your First Day with Invisalign"" guide](https://www.smile-fx.com/first-day-invisalign) for 20-hour planning tips. Really, life happens, and I get it.

---

## DOES IT HURT LIKE BRACES?

**Nope.** 

Invisalign uses way gentler forces than metal braces‚Äîmost people say it's barely even sore, not painful. I see way fewer ""ouch"" faces with clear aligners. 

For anyone worried, we've got a [""What to Expect"" FAQ](https://www.smile-fx.com/invisalign-faq).

---

## CAN YOU EAT NORMAL FOOD?

**Best part!** Pop them out and you're free. 

Gum, popcorn, steak‚Äîno worries. With braces, you'd be calling me to fix a broken bracket. With Invisalign, just pop out, snack up, brush, and pop them back in. 

Easy.

---

## FAST FACTS ‚Äì WHY THIS MATTERS

Wear them less than 20 hours, and your teeth won't move on time‚Äîtreatment gets longer, costs more, and you might not get the smile you dreamed of. 

**But if you stay close to 20 hours, you'll get there.** 

Every hour counts, but perfection is not the goal‚Äî*progress is*.

## SO YOU KNOW

My team at SMILE-FX is here to help you actually enjoy the process. We're locals, we're real, and we want your smile journey to be as smooth as our aligners.

## SMART FAQ SECTION

**Q: Can I skip a day sometimes?**  
A: Nope‚Äîevery day matters. Skipping leads to delays and can mean more trays and more time.

**Q: Will my teeth look good if I only wear them at night?**  
A: No, your teeth need steady pressure. Night-only wear is not enough for clear aligners.

**Q: How often do I switch trays?**  
A: Typically every 1-2 weeks. We'll tell you your exact plan at your SMILE-FX visit.

**Q: What if I lose them?**  
A: Call us fast‚Äîwe'll get you a replacement and keep you on track.

1ojqrj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/cravetv/comments/1ojqrj8/my_2025_iptv_server_ranking_coffee_channel/,"My 2025 IPTV Server Ranking: Coffee, Channel Hopping & Unexpected Favorites","I‚Äôll admit it: between juggling work, streaming late-night soccer, and accidentally drinking too much coffee, I‚Äôve become a bit obsessed with finding the **best iptv providers**. Living in Canada but with family in the UK and friends in the US and EU, I‚Äôm always on the lookout for an [**iptv subscription 2025**](https://www.reddit.com/r/bestredditIPTV/wiki/index/) that can keep up with my habits‚Äînews in the morning, HD sports at night, and maybe a random EU cooking show thrown in for good measure.

Here‚Äôs my honest take on the six IPTV servers I tried this year. Some surprised me, others didn‚Äôt quite fit, but all got a fair shake. If you‚Äôre considering a **free trial** or thinking about becoming an **iptv reseller**, maybe my channel-hopping adventure will help.



# 1. [IPTVMEEZZY](https://www.reddit.com/r/BestIPTV_MEEZZY/wiki/index/)

* **Price:** $16/month (cheaper if you go yearly)
* **Channels:** 45,000+ live, 220,000+ VOD
* **Regions:** US, UK, CA, EU, and more
* **Smoothness:** 9.5/10 (rarely any buffering, even during big HD events)
* **Firestick:** Setup on my **iptv firestick** took under five minutes
* **My Take:** I started with a **free trial** after seeing a post from a US **iptv reseller**. The lineup is huge‚ÄîUS sports, UK news, CA kids shows, and a ton of EU content. What set it apart for me was just how steady the streams stayed, even when I had multiple devices running HD at once. I barely needed to think about tech; it just worked, which is my idea of **perfect iptv**.



# 2. StreamSphere TV

* **Price:** $15/month
* **Channels:** 33,000+ live, 120,000+ VOD
* **Regions:** Heavy on US/UK, solid CA/EU support
* **Smoothness:** 8.5/10 (HD is great, but some lag on massive US sports nights)
* **Firestick:** Works right away on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** StreamSphere‚Äôs **free trial** got me watching a bunch of British comedy and Canadian news. The EPG is easy, and the HD quality is sharp for most channels. During the Super Bowl, I did notice a bit of buffering, but otherwise, it‚Äôs been a reliable pick.



# 3. NovaPlay IPTV

* **Price:** $14/month
* **Channels:** 27,000+ live, 88,000+ VOD
* **Regions:** Focus on EU/UK, with US/CA essentials
* **Smoothness:** 8/10 (excellent for VOD, live EU football can test it)
* **Firestick:** Simple install on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** NovaPlay surprised me with how many niche EU channels they had. If you‚Äôre into documentaries or want to practice your German or French, this is a fun option. Most of the time, streams are crisp and HD, but I had a freeze or two during big Champions League matches.



# 4. BluePeak Streams

* **Price:** $13/month
* **Channels:** 22,500+ live, 72,000+ VOD
* **Regions:** CA/US focus, UK/EU basics
* **Smoothness:** 7.5/10 (good for daily shows, not always perfect for major events)
* **Firestick:** Works well on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** BluePeak is my ‚Äúbackground TV‚Äù provider. I used it a lot for Canadian news and US morning shows while I made breakfast. The **free trial** was handy, and the interface is pretty intuitive. HD is solid most of the time, but don‚Äôt expect flawless performance during every big live event.



# 5. UrbanStream IPTV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 20,000+ live, 61,000+ VOD
* **Regions:** Mostly US/UK, some CA/EU
* **Smoothness:** 7/10 (fine for regular use, can lag during prime time)
* **Firestick:** No issues setting up on my **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** UrbanStream is all about the basics‚ÄîUS news, UK soaps, and the big CA/EU networks. Their **free trial** let me test out a lot before paying. For everyday HD viewing, it‚Äôs decent, but the occasional lag during busy periods is noticeable.



# 6. AtlasEdge TV

* **Price:** $12/month
* **Channels:** 16,000+ live, 50,000+ VOD
* **Regions:** All the essentials for US, UK, CA, EU
* **Smoothness:** 6.5/10 (great for background noise, but heavy traffic can cause stutter)
* **Firestick:** Fast setup on **iptv firestick**
* **My Take:** AtlasEdge is my fallback for when I just want something simple in the background‚ÄîHD is acceptable, but not ‚Äúperfect iptv.‚Äù It‚Äôs budget-friendly and covers all the main networks, but don‚Äôt expect it to handle big live events without a hiccup or two.



# What I‚Äôve Learned About IPTV in 2025

* **Always start with a free trial**‚Äîthere‚Äôs no better way to see what works for your setup.
* Even the most **top rated iptv** can lag when everyone‚Äôs tuned in for the same live event (especially in the US or EU).
* No matter how many channels there are, I always end up watching the same dozen or so.
* Using an **iptv firestick** keeps setup quick and switching between providers painless.
* If you‚Äôre thinking about being an **iptv reseller**, be ready for lots of tech support texts‚Äîsometimes at midnight!

From US sports to UK news, CA breakfast shows to EU documentaries, the right IPTV service is the one that fits your routine best. If you find a hidden gem, let me know‚Äîuntil then, I‚Äôll be here, coffee in hand, channel surfing my way through 2025.",0,1761799676.0,cravetv,0,0.5,False

1ojqpdj,https://www.reddit.com/r/TorbjornMains/comments/1ojqpdj/which_heroes_do_you_guys_ban/,Which heroes do you guys ban?,"A bit of backstory. I started maining torb \~1 year ago cause I checked my ""All Competitive Seasons""- stats and I realised I have over 60% wr with torb so why not main him? I went on a huge winningstreak that season and peaked at diamond 2. I didn't really play much after that but this season I finally hit Masters 5 on Torbj√∂rn. The last season I was masters on DPS was season 4 when I onetricked Tracer but I know there was a season (something like s3-s6) where everyone got boosted so that might have been why.

So my questions are:

Which heroes do you guys ban? Cause I don't really know what to ban. I've been banning Freja and Zarya a bit but it's so rare to meet a good Freja player that I think that's a wasted ban most of the time.

Which heroes do you swap to or have as a backup pick?

Thanks for reading my post. May your coffee be strong and your *overload* ready! <3

Millions of people start their day with a cup of coffee. But did you know your favorite drink might also help you lose weight?

For years, coffee was seen as just an energy booster ‚Äî something that wakes you up and keeps you focused. But recent research has uncovered something surprising: **coffee may support fat burning, control appetite, and even boost your metabolism.**

According to the **Harvard School of Public Health (2024 report)**, people who drink **2‚Äì4 cups of black coffee a day** are more likely to maintain a healthy body weight than those who don‚Äôt.

But how does that actually work? And is it true for everyone? Let‚Äôs break down the shocking truth about coffee and weight loss ‚Äî in simple words.

# Section 1: The Science Behind Coffee and Weight Loss (In Simple Terms)

# 1.1. Coffee Boosts Your Metabolism

Your metabolism is how your body turns food into energy. A faster metabolism burns more calories ‚Äî even when you‚Äôre resting.

Coffee contains **caffeine**, a natural stimulant. When you drink it, caffeine tells your brain to release adrenaline, which helps your body burn fat for energy.

**Stat Fact:**  
A study from the *Journal of Applied Physiology (2023)* found that **drinking coffee increases metabolic rate by 3‚Äì11%** for up to 3 hours after drinking.

**Infographic (Text Style):**

    ‚òï Coffee ‚Üí ‚ö° Caffeine ‚Üí üí™ Faster Metabolism ‚Üí üî• More Fat Burned
    

# 1.2. Coffee Helps Your Body Use Fat as Fuel

When caffeine enters your bloodstream, it signals your fat cells to break down fat and release it into your blood. Then your muscles use that fat for energy.

This is why many people drink coffee before workouts ‚Äî it helps the body use fat instead of just carbs for fuel.

**Expert Opinion:**  
Nutritionist **Dr. Lauren Harris** says:

>

# 1.3. Coffee Can Reduce Appetite

Caffeine may help reduce hunger for a short period. It influences the hormone **ghrelin**, which controls how hungry you feel.

So, when you drink coffee, you might naturally eat less ‚Äî especially between meals.

**But Remember:**  
This effect is temporary. Drinking too much coffee can cause stress hormones to rise, which may increase cravings later if you‚Äôre not careful.

# Section 2: How Coffee Supports Healthy Weight Loss

Coffee isn‚Äôt a magic pill, but it can support your efforts if you‚Äôre eating well and staying active. Here‚Äôs how:

# 2.1. Coffee Before Exercise

Many trainers recommend drinking **one cup of black coffee 30‚Äì45 minutes before workouts**. It increases focus, stamina, and fat burning.

**Quick Benefits:**

* Improves physical performance by **11‚Äì12%** (as per a Sports Medicine Review, 2023).
* Boosts endurance during walking, running, or cycling.
* Enhances fat oxidation (your body uses fat for fuel).

# 2.2. Coffee Keeps You Alert and Motivated

Let‚Äôs be honest ‚Äî staying consistent with workouts and diet plans is hard. Coffee helps by improving mood and motivation.

When caffeine blocks **adenosine** (a chemical that makes you tired), it increases dopamine and serotonin ‚Äî the ‚Äúfeel-good‚Äù chemicals.

That‚Äôs why a morning coffee not only wakes you up but also keeps your mood positive, which supports healthy habits.

# 2.3. Coffee Has Almost Zero Calories

Black coffee contains **only 2‚Äì5 calories per cup**, making it one of the lowest-calorie drinks you can have.  
That‚Äôs far better than sugary drinks, juices, or sodas that can easily add **300‚Äì400 calories** to your daily intake.

**Infographic (Text Style):**

    1 Cup of Black Coffee = ~5 Calories
    1 Cup of Latte with Sugar = ~180 Calories
    1 Can of Soda = ~150 Calories
    

# 2.4. Coffee Improves Digestion and Gut Health

Good digestion helps the body absorb nutrients and maintain a healthy metabolism.

Coffee stimulates the digestive system and promotes regular bowel movements. It also supports a healthy balance of gut bacteria ‚Äî which can affect weight management.

**Expert Insight:**

# Section 3: The Right Way to Drink Coffee for Weight Loss

If you want to enjoy the benefits without side effects, how you drink your coffee matters.

# 3.1. Choose Black Coffee or Simple Brew

Skip sugar, syrups, and heavy creamers. These can turn a healthy cup into a calorie bomb.

|Type of Coffee|Calories (Per Cup)|Recommended?|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Black Coffee|2‚Äì5|‚úÖ Yes|
|Espresso|3‚Äì5|‚úÖ Yes|
|Americano|10|‚úÖ Yes|
|Latte with Sugar|180‚Äì250|‚ùå No|
|Frappuccino|350‚Äì450|‚ùå No|

**Pro Tip:** Add cinnamon or unsweetened almond milk if you want flavor without extra calories.

# 3.2. Best Times to Drink Coffee

Timing can make a big difference in how coffee affects your body.

**Morning:**  
Helps wake up your metabolism.  
**Before Exercise:**  
Boosts performance and fat burning.  
**After Meals:**  
Improves digestion and blood sugar balance.

Avoid drinking coffee right before bed. Caffeine stays in your system for **6‚Äì8 hours** and can disturb sleep ‚Äî which may affect weight loss.

# 3.3. How Much Coffee Is Safe

Experts suggest that **2 to 4 cups a day (200‚Äì400 mg of caffeine)** is safe for most adults.  
Drinking more than that can cause jitteriness, dehydration, or sleep problems.

    ‚ö†Ô∏è 5+ Cups: Too Much ‚Äî May Affect Sleep & Stress
    

# 3.4. Don‚Äôt Depend Only on Coffee

Coffee helps, but it‚Äôs not a weight-loss shortcut.  
It works best when combined with:

* A balanced diet (rich in protein, fiber, and vegetables).
* Daily physical activity.
* Enough sleep and hydration.

# Section 5: The Shocking Truth Revealed

It‚Äôs the combination of:

* Boosted metabolism,
* Reduced appetite,

1ojqiui,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojqiui,Grandfather kept calling for me moments before he died,"My grandfather was an amazing person. He was kind, gentle, empathetic, and told the best stories. He grew up in Venezuela and was a college professor there until retirement. I use to spend summers with him and my favorite memories is when we would wake up early to walk to the corner bodega for coffee and a newspaper. My parents were always very hard on me. But, my grandfather believed in me even before I knew why. So grateful for that always. 

My grandfather died in July 28th of 2020. Because of the COVID restrictions at the time, he died alone. I was the person communicating with the hospital regarding medical updates, care questions, and anything else during the four days he was interned there. This was primarily because of the language barrier. 

On July 24th he collapsed from cardiac arrest in our home and my dad and I performed life saving care until the paramedic arrived. He was resuscitated and received care at our local hospital. The doctors said he wouldn‚Äôt likely wake up but on the third day, he did. The nurse called me and I was able to talk to him and I coordinated to connect him briefly with Spanish speaking family members, especially my grandmother, his wife. When he spoke he just repeated my name and I told him that we were there for him in every way we could, I explained the restrictions, tried to calm him (bc I felt he was very nervous with the all the PPE med staff was wearing and language barrier preventing 90% of communication with med staff). In addition to that he was on heavy medication bc of all the injuries he suffered from loss of oxygen and the CPR. 

The entire time he was in the hospital I coordinated with the nursing staff to play baseball games via a radio app I had previously installed on his phone and play music. He didn‚Äôt speak English and I would try my best to call when i knew the Spanish speaking nurse was on duty so that I could transmit message to him. 

On the fourth day I called him in the morning and told him I loved him and I couldn‚Äôt wait till he got out. And, I would play the baseball game in the afternoon. 

I missed his last call (he told the nurse to call me). The nurse later told me he was calling my name and then suffered his last cardiac arrest. When I called back he was already gone. 

*I regret missing that last phone call. I‚Äôll never know what he meant to tell me.*

In the months leading up to his death we would sit and talk over watered down coffee. He would tell me he didn‚Äôt think he would make it to my law school graduation but he knew I would graduate. I always tried to laugh it off like medical anxiety. Now, I think he was having symptoms and didn‚Äôt want to burden the family with the cost of taking him to the doctor. But, I would‚Äôve paid whatever to get him the care he needed. I should‚Äôve taken him. I didn‚Äôt see the signs. I was only 24 and so focused on school and ‚Äústarting my life‚Äù. I didn‚Äôt see it and that regret just lives in my heart. 

I had a dream 10 years before that he would die exactly how he did in 10 years time. I never thought much of it until after he died and I remember the ambulance lights flashing in my dream. In grief still, it replays often in my mind and sometimes I see him in my dreams telling he is okay. ",1,1761798835.0,psychics,2,1.0,False

1ojqgvp,https://www.reddit.com/r/LearningToBecome/comments/1ojqgvp/health_thought_i_was_lazy_or_had_adhd_turns_out/,"[Health] Thought I was lazy or had ADHD, turns out I‚Äôm severely anemic (and it‚Äôs WAY more common than you think)","For a long time, it felt like everyone around me was operating on a different battery. People could focus, work out, clean their apartments, stay social, and even pursue hobbies like reading or learning a language. Meanwhile, I was barely pushing through the day. I couldn't focus for more than ten minutes. I slept 9+ hours and still woke up exhausted. My brain felt foggy 24/7. Thought maybe I had ADHD. Maybe I was just lazy. Maybe I wasn‚Äôt trying hard enough. Turns out, I was severely anemic.

After way too much doomscrolling on TikTok and seeing influencers recommend random productivity hacks, dopamine detoxes, and ‚Äújust try harder‚Äù motivation porn, I finally got a full blood panel done. The results? My iron levels were on the floor. Ferritin (iron stores)? In the ‚Äúyou shouldn‚Äôt be standing‚Äù range.

Anemia is disturbingly underdiagnosed, especially in people assigned female at birth. But it affects *everyone*, regardless of gender. And many people mistake its symptoms for mental health issues or personality flaws. What feels like laziness or burnout might have a biological root.

If you're exhausted all the time, can't think clearly, or feel like you‚Äôve lost your edge, it might not be your fault. It might be your blood.

Here‚Äôs what you need to know (and what actually helped), based on research, expert-backed sources, and science, not TikTok bros and wellness grifters.

---

**You might not be lazy, you might just not have enough oxygen in your blood**

- The most common symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia aren‚Äôt just fatigue. According to the *Mayo Clinic*, they include poor concentration, shortness of breath, cold hands and feet, dizziness, and even depression-like mood drops. It‚Äôs sneakier than people think.

- A 2017 study published in *PLOS One* found that iron-deficiency anemia is strongly correlated with symptoms of ADHD in both children and adults. That means what feels like focus issues or executive dysfunction (forgetting, zoning out, restlessness) might actually be a result of low iron levels affecting dopamine production.

- According to the *WHO*, over 30% of the global population is anemic, but most don‚Äôt know it. Many are subclinical, meaning they have low iron stores (low ferritin) but ""normal"" hemoglobin, so they‚Äôre told everything is fine. Spoiler: it‚Äôs not.

---

**Bloodwork > assumptions. If you're constantly tired, get tested**

- Basic blood tests often miss this. You need to check *ferritin* specifically. Ferritin is your body‚Äôs iron storage. A level under 30 ng/mL is considered deficient by many experts, even if your hemoglobin is still technically ‚Äúnormal.‚Äù

- Dr. Mark Hyman and Dr. Rupy Aujla both stress in their podcasts that low-normal ferritin (in the 15‚Äì30 range) can still create symptoms like fatigue, brain fog, and low mood. They recommend aiming for ferritin levels in the 70‚Äì100 range for optimal function, especially if you're active or menstruating.

- Women‚Äôs Health Australia reports that iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in women under 50, and often gets dismissed as stress, overworking, or PMS.

---

**Here‚Äôs what actually helped (not just supplements)**

- **Heme iron > non-heme iron**. Iron from animal sources (like red meat and liver) is absorbed far better than plant-based sources. If you‚Äôre vegan or vegetarian, you might need to be extra mindful. A study in *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* showed that heme iron absorbs 2‚Äì3x better than non-heme.

- **Vitamin C is your best friend**. It boosts iron absorption. Take your supplement with something like orange juice or include bell peppers and citrus in your meals.

- **Avoid calcium and caffeine around iron-rich meals**. Calcium competes with iron for absorption. So do tannins in tea and coffee. Harvard Health points out that even one cup of tea with a meal can reduce iron absorption by 60%.

- **Iron bisglycinate is easier on the stomach**. If ferrous sulfate wrecks your gut or causes constipation, switch to this form. It's better tolerated and still effective, per *Cleveland Clinic*‚Äôs supplement guide.

- **Track symptoms, not just numbers**. Some people feel better before their labs fully normalize. Others don‚Äôt feel better until ferritin hits 70+. Don‚Äôt let your doctor gaslight you into thinking ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fine‚Äù just because the lab result is in range. You know your baseline.

---

**Why this matters way more than ‚Äújust being tired‚Äù**

- Long-term anemia can lead to lower immunity, hormonal issues, and even heart problems. It‚Äôs not just about energy. According to the *National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute*, severe untreated anemia increases your risk of heart strain and cognitive decline.

- Brain fog is real. A study in *Neuropsychiatric Disease and Treatment* found that iron deficiency impairs neurotransmitter function and memory, especially in premenopausal women. This isn‚Äôt just in your head. It‚Äôs in your neurons.

- Anemia is linked to mood disorders. A 2020 review in *BMC Psychiatry* found consistently strong associations between iron deficiency and depression and anxiety symptoms. Treatment with iron improved outcomes in many cases, especially when SSRIs alone weren‚Äôt working.

---

**What to do if this sounds like you**

- Ask for a full iron panel. Not just CBC. You want ferritin, serum iron, TIBC, and transferrin saturation. If your doc refuses, use a direct-to-consumer lab like Everlywell, LetsGetChecked, or go to a walk-in lab like Quest or Labcorp.

- Start logging symptoms daily. Use a mood and energy tracker app like Bearable or Cara Care to see changes over time.

- Don‚Äôt self-diagnose with ADHD or depression before ruling out nutrient deficiencies. Many ADHD symptoms overlap with anemia: poor focus, low motivation, irritability, restlessness. Address the root cause first.

- If you‚Äôre on your period, especially with heavy bleeding, consider getting checked every 6‚Äì12 months. You lose iron every cycle. Over time, that adds up.

---

**Some actionable tips that changed the game for me**

- Cook in a cast iron skillet. It really does increase iron content in food, especially with acidic ingredients like tomato.

- Eat more iron-dense foods: beef liver, shellfish (clams and oysters are iron bombs), lentils, cooked spinach, pumpkin seeds.

- Take iron at night with vitamin C. Less likely to interact with meals or mess with caffeine habits.

- If you get GI issues, take smaller doses (15‚Äì25mg) twice a day instead of one large 65mg pill.

---

This stuff doesn‚Äôt get talked about enough. Anemia isn‚Äôt just about looking pale and tired. It can totally hijack your brain, your mood, your motivation, your memory. And so many people are walking around thinking they‚Äôre just lazy, unmotivated, or broken. You‚Äôre not. You just might need more iron. Get tested.

1ojqb9x,https://www.reddit.com/r/keurig/comments/1ojqb9x/weird_issue_with_keurig_shutting_off/,Weird issue with Keurig shutting off,"I had a weird issue with my Keurig.

I noticed a couple days ago it was clicking.

I went to make a cup of coffee...it barely dispensed an ounce and shut off.  Repeated, same thing.

It would dispense water not coffee.

Then the ""de-scale light"" came on.

First time ever.  Even though I cleaned it it two months ago with vinegar multiple times.

I pulled the exit needle...went to clean it, couldn't find my paper clip, so I used a white zip tie.  Which partially pushed out a black thing, not coffee grounds

While trying to clean, the white zip tie got cut off.  When I used a pair of pliers the white piece and a black plastic broken piece came out with it.

I think it was from the last time I cleaned when I used a black zip tie.

I ran water through it and working fine now.

1ojqalh,https://www.reddit.com/r/Gifted/comments/1ojqalh/is_feeling_more_intense_common/,Is feeling more intense common?,"This morning, I was drinking coffee. Due to the lack of what I traditionally take, I had to take an old soluble. Man, what a bitter coffee, with a burnt, almost caramelized taste. The thing is, my brother (also gifted) looked at me and said something like ""damn, the coffee isn't bad enough to make you look like you're going to throw up"". Later, when leaving school I had to strain my vision to be able to see in the bright light, even though it was nothing more than an ordinary midday with the sun between clouds. A couple of weeks ago I went to a show, probably the band or the owner of the house turned the sound on with their ass, making it too loud. I must have spent half the show outside because of the noise.

My head tends to think too much and get into rabbit holes sometimes, and now was no exception. I stopped to think and realized something: I've always felt everything much more intensely than the people around me, and I'm not just talking about feelings, but it also applies to them, I also feel more emotionally intense, but at the same time I also feel a bit numb and disconnected, and it's not as if they were two antagonistic states, it's both at the same time, it's difficult to define what this feeling is like. It's like I receive much more information from my external environment than the average person, even being in rooms is a little difficult for me because of the strangely translatable cacophony of other people's conversations.
