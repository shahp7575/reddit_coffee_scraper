Tw: depression

So, one day me and my ex (bf at the time) had an argument about my mental health after my first therapy session, he tells that my vision of the future (referring to my suicidality) isn’t compatible with him cause he wants something durable and that it would also affect him negatively (cause he is depressed too). This argument ends with him saying that he misunderstood cause he thought that I was giving up on therapy and getting better (which I wasn’t). 

From that day tho he starts behaving weirdly, distant, uncaring, basically stopped texting me and he avoided seeing me for 10 days (when we usually saw each other every other day), so I asked if he was sure he wanted to keep staying with me and he says he’s sure so I tell myself I’m just overthinking it. Then here it comes, the “we need to talk” text 😆 my ex breaks up with me in July saying he doesn’t feel anything anymore.

A month later he comes back saying he misses me and regrets his decision, to that I answer that his actions left me very confused and I didn’t know what to do, I then tell him that he should think about it better cause if he said those things just a month earlier there must have been a reason and the conversation ends with him saying “I will reflect on it more cause you deserve certainty, if you want do it too”

Neither of us reached out to the other for 4 months, me because I was completely thrown in my own world by depression, him I don’t know tbh.

On December I get a text from him due to a drama that has formed in our friend group (basically a “friend” spread the rumor that I talked bad about my ex, he then confessed he made it up I still don’t know why lol but ok) and after a long conversation about this he then asks me if I’d like to meet up for a coffee and chat a little.

From there we restored our friendship which I was really happy about cause I still care a lot about him and he’s still the person I feel the most comfortable with, so we started hanging out here and there until last week.

He sends me “I wanted to ask you, are you hanging out with me only as friends?” and then we get into a deep convo of him telling me that he thinks he feels something when he’s with me, that he misses me and that these past days he was thinking about telling me this. I replied honestly and told him that I am too depressed to get into a relationship cause I wouldn’t be able to give what a partner needs, that I was unsure if I was making the right decision but it would be unfair to make him wait for an answer and so to take it as a no.

He took it really badly, he was hurting a lot and started saying things like he’ll never heal and that he wants to punch himself for losing me etc. and at he end we agreed that he should take some time for himself and so we stopped talking.

I am worried I made many mistakes that lead to his great suffering, first leaving that conversation without a clear end and then not making things clear when we first started hanging out again.
Even though he confirmed to me on our last conversation that he thought it was as friends too, I still feel guilty, probably because I am aware that I was running away a little from this topic and hoped it would never come out but I think that’s because I was still completely confused on what to do, I started genuinely thinking about it on these last few days when I saw that he was trying to get closer to me and I came to the conclusion that it’s better for me to stay alone until I get better (if I ever will). I wanted to bring it up when I saw him next but he anticipated me via text.

That’s all, thank you if you read everything, I really really need some feedback: do you think I did something wrong? What should have I done instead? Idk, anything 😭🙏",1,1740175522.0,emotionalintelligence,0,1.0,False

🥦 **Eat Real Food** – More protein, fiber, and healthy fats. Less ultra-processed junk. Balance, not restriction.  
😴 **Prioritize Sleep** – 7-9 hours. No doom-scrolling before bed. Your body will thank you.  
🧘‍♂️ **Manage Stress** – Exercise, deep breaths, hobbies. If life feels overwhelming, simplify.

I have read that the fat:protein ratio should be 2:1 but I have seen that ratio be both in calories and in weight.

Asking Chat GPT I get the information that this NY Steak doesn't reach the 2:1 ratio - neither by weight nor calories - but for example Dr Chaffee says that just eating pure meat from beef like a ribeye should be enough so I am a little bit confused.

I do feel tired all the time and I have been on this diet for roughly 6 months mainly eating ribeye and NY Steak, I stopped drinking coffee around 4 months ago and only drink water (sparkling and still) i.e. no sodas. I have deviated from the diet by getting drunk (mainly on beer) roughly one time per month which also includes eating some bad food such as chips and bread but then back on the train the following day.

At the moment I have been very strict and have cut off all alcohol and only eat ribeye and NY Steak and I have two questions:

1. How much, in weight. should I eat of this meat (Male, 38 years old, moderate active such as walking the dogs daily for 45 minutes)?
2. Should I add fat to it?
3. The fat that drips from the meat when preparing it in the Ninja Air Fryer what should I do with it?

I am entrepreneur from SF, kinda not sure If i should call myself as an entrepreneur at this stage, but I just started working on an AI project with 2 of my friends, even though I am still in college with no prior experience on starting a company. We have solid understanding of what we want to build and kinda planned out some strategies. I know what I want to do and how to do that. However, lately I've been feeling overwhelmed. I wanted to hear someone's (a total stranger) opinion on our project to get some feedbacks. I came across this lady in coffee shop in SFDT, and accidentally overheard her conversation which she said she an engineer at a AI Tech company. Since It was my first ever time, I might have reached out awkwardly, and I explained my project and everything. But she started acting very offensive, grilled me about my project. But mostly, it was very simple questions. However, I got nervous and started to over-explain my idea which sounded very vague and amateur. So, I noticed that I need to practice. If I can't answer those simple questions with short and simple answers, how am I going to sell it.

So, I wanted to create a circle or friend's group or whatever, But the Idea is, I want to collect a few people who wants to build a startup in AI and want to share what's going on with their project, or need an outside opinion, and overall just share any information that might be helpful. I want real conversations, not some validation or pretenders that act like know-it-all. I want bunch of amateurs with motive to grow.

I go. The sound vibrates through my ribs, hums deep in my bones. Not bad. Not life-changing. But July’s curves under loose linen? Impressive.

After, she says, “Let’s go claying.”

I don’t ask what that means. I just follow.

She molds something raw, something bold. **Fearless.** It fits.

Later, her lips are close. She smells warm, like citrus and salt. I breathe her in. The kiss is gravity, inevitable. No hesitation, no resistance. Just heat.

Then—**BOOM. BOOM. BOOM. BAP!** Fireworks rattle the sky.

She laughs. “Well, hello, July.”

We move through each other like we already know the choreography. Touch, friction, surrender. A rhythm as old as time.

Then—**a crash. A blur of white. A loud, indignant meow.**

A cat. Small, fluffy, demanding.

“I’ve been an… actor. Not the Hollywood kind.” I meet her eyes. “The *other* kind.”

She doesn’t flinch. Just tilts her head. “And?”

Most people would run. Most people would judge.

She doesn’t.

Instead, she whispers, “Do you *want* to keep doing it?”

I hesitate. Then: “Not really. But money’s tight.”

She holds my gaze. “Then let’s figure it out. Together.”

Fuck. She’s really *that* cool.

Club Noir. We go together.

Low bass. Velvet booths. The usual crowd.

Backstage, Frank’s pissed. “You’ve *never* flopped.”

I rub my temples. “First time for everything.”

Jeffrey, our rigger, shrugs. “I’ll do it.”

Frank exhales. “Fine. But this is a one-time favor.”

I don’t care. The moment I stepped in, I knew—I wasn’t that guy anymore.

July squeezes my hand. “Let’s go.”

We leave together.

Outside, the night air tastes new. Fleffy will be waiting.

the way i structure my roleplay is like an intro, then i go into PIs but i kind of explicitly state like ""first, i'm gonna be talking ab \[PI\]. what this essentially means is \[define PI\]. oftentimes, companies do \[examples of PI\]. however, in our situation, the best strategy that i've identified is \[connect PI to situation\]"" and then i add some visuals and stuff. 

\- how do i make it more like a story and not explicitly state ""first, let's do this \[PI\]!"" but also make it clear to the judge what PI im talking ab so it's easy to grade?

\- how do you time yourself? i yap a lot and idk how to stop it

\- would bringing in like coffee & donuts or something be like kissing ass or is it okay to do stuff like that? will judges be weirded out??

\- i think my event's gonna have like \~100 (if not more) people, and i think u have to place top 4 to go to ICDC. any general tips for how i can REALLY stand out??

Hey there,

I’ll be in Bangalore from next week, and while I could just explore the city solo, I think it’d be way more fun with the right company. So, I’m looking for someone who enjoys good conversations, effortless banter, and maybe a little bit of mischief (the fun kind).

A little about me: I’m a doctor, a coffee enthusiast, and someone who can probably diagnose your caffeine addiction while enabling it. I enjoy music, spontaneous adventures, and deep conversations—preferably over a flat white. I also firmly believe in the scientific method, which means we should first test our conversational chemistry online before taking this experiment to real life.

If we vibe, I’d love to take you out—maybe a cozy café, a rooftop bar, or a live music spot. And if the chemistry is undeniable… well, I’m all for seeing where the night (or morning) takes us, with full consent, mutual enthusiasm, and zero awkwardness the next day.

So, if you’re fun, open-minded, and up for making my Bangalore trip a little more interesting, drop me a message! Let’s chat, flirt, and see where this goes.

Looking forward to meeting someone who gets my jokes (or at least pretends to).",1,1740174674.0,SFWr4rIndia,0,1.0,False

I’m the devoted Luna, and my mate Elias is the Alpha of our pack. I know plenty of she-wolves have their eyes on him. Although he pretends to be loyal, it's hard to ignore the signs when your mate starts betraying you. Even an Alpha, as strong as he is, usually knows how to hide it well enough. But I’m not just some ordinary she-wolf—I’m a Luna. Evelina, my best friend, couldn’t hide her frustration. “Just reject him already! Mates are like buses—they come around every ten minutes!” I glanced at the pendant she wore, the same one Alpha Elias, my mate, had recently saved in his online shopping cart, and responded coolly, “Mates who are wealthy and generous like him aren’t so easy to find.” When I got home, I nestled into Elias’s arms, pretending to be helpless. “Alpha,” I whispered, my voice soft and submissive, “don’t you think it’s time we secured another property for our daughter?” The house was bought, the gold was secured... Then his lover decided to make things official. I could only pretend to cry and step aside, taking all the assets with me. Later, my ex-mate came crawling back. “We agreed this was just a temporary separation.” But, “Sorry, this darling Luna can’t handle any more hardship!” ---",1,1740174580.0,romancenovels,2,1.0,False

Sam Jones, a whirlwind of nervous energy, fidgeted with the sugar packet, tearing the corner off and letting the granules spill onto the table. Across from him, Matt Jones, calm and steady as ever, chuckled.
""Relax, Sam,"" Matt said, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""It's just coffee.""
""Easy for you to say,"" Sam mumbled, trying to brush the sugar off the worn wooden surface. ""You're not the one about to propose.""
Matt's smile softened.  He reached across the table, his hand covering Sam's. ""And you think I don't have butterflies too?""
Sam looked up, surprised. He'd always seen Matt as the picture of composure.  ""Really?""
Matt squeezed Sam's hand gently. ""Really.  This is… important, Sam.  More important than anything.""
The rain outside intensified, a sudden downpour that seemed to isolate them in their little bubble of warmth and intimacy. Sam took a deep breath, the scent of coffee and cinnamon filling his lungs. He pulled a small, velvet box from his pocket.  His hands were shaking so much he almost dropped it.
""Matt,"" he began, his voice a little shaky. ""We've been together for… well, it feels like forever.  And it's been the best forever.  You're… you're my best friend, my confidant, the peanut butter to my jelly, the…""
Matt laughed, a warm, genuine sound that made Sam's heart flutter. ""I get it, Sam. You're eloquent as always.""
Sam grinned, the tension easing slightly. He opened the box. Inside, nestled on a bed of satin, were two simple silver rings, each engraved with the other's initials.
""Matt Jones,"" Sam said, his voice now clear and strong. ""Will you marry me?""
The cafe seemed to hold its breath. Even the rain outside quieted to a gentle patter. Matt's eyes, usually so full of laughter, were now shining with tears. He nodded, unable to speak.
""Yes, Sam,"" he finally whispered, his voice thick with emotion. ""Yes, a thousand times yes.""
Sam let out a whoop of joy, a sound that startled a few heads in the cafe. He slid the ring onto Matt's finger, and Matt did the same for him.  They looked at each other, two souls intertwined, the rain outside a gentle soundtrack to their happiness.  The world outside could wait.  They had each other.  And that was all that mattered.

1iv2lb5,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1iv2lb5/the_power_of_pausing_why_slowing_down_can_speed/,The Power of Pausing: Why Slowing Down Can Speed You Up,"**Ever feel like life's just one big race?** 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♀️ We’re all sprinting towards something, right? Whether it's that next promotion, losing those last ten pounds, or even just clearing your to-do list for the day. But guess what? *Slowing down* might actually be the secret sauce to getting there faster. *Wait... what?* 🤔

Let me hit you with a little personal story. I used to be the kind of person who jam-packed my calendar like some sort of productivity puzzle—if there was white space, I filled it. Burnout? Nah, just coffee. 😅 But one day, I hit a wall (figuratively, thank goodness) and had this epiphany: **I was always moving but not really progressing.** 

So, I gave myself permission to *pause*. Yep, just stop and breathe. Here's what I've learned on this wild, counterintuitive journey:

- **Clarity Upgrades:** When you stop for a minute, you actually get a chance to think. Imagine that! All those ideas bouncing around can settle, and suddenly, you've got this laser focus. Like one of those “Aha!” moments that make you wonder why you ever stressed in the first place.

- **Creative Fuel:** It’s like your brain goes on a mini-vacation. 🏖️ You step away and bam—new ideas, solutions, and inspiration just pop out of nowhere. Seriously, I dare you to just stare at a cloud for five minutes and see where your mind wanders. Magical.

- **Energy Recharge:** Sprinting through life is exhausting. By slowing down, you’re recharging your batteries. Think of it as a mental pit stop—just changing the tires on your brain car. 🚗💨

- **Reduced Stress Levels:** Let’s face it, the world isn’t going to implode if you answer that email 10 minutes later. Crazy, I know. But slowing down gives your mind and body a chance to chill, reducing stress and ultimately boosting your performance.

And here’s a little trick: **start small.** Maybe take a 5-minute walk without your phone (I know, terrifying), or just savor your morning coffee instead of chugging it like you’re putting out a fire. ☕ 

Now, I get it, the idea of slowing down can feel awkward or even lazy at first. In a world that constantly screams “Go, go, go!” imagine the power in choosing to relax a bit, hit the pause button, and recharge. **Crazy stuff happens when you do.** Not convinced? Just try it and see if you don’t start noticing a difference.

Like most things, there’s a sweet spot—and when you find yours, it’s like unlocking a secret level in a game you’ve been playing forever. 🌟

Ever had a moment where slowing down changed the game for you? Or maybe you're skeptical about this whole ""take it easy"" thing? It's all good, and everyone's journey is different, right? 🌈",1,1740174187.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False

If you’re after food that doesn’t leave you in a post-lunch coma, RASK has you sorted. Just fresh, honest food that actually makes you feel good. Inspired by the Danish way of eating (think balance, not bland), this place serves up the kind of food that keeps you going without the regret.

The menu is built around ‘good for you’ ingredients, but don’t let that fool you, it still delivers on flavour. Big, hearty salads, open sandwiches, and a brunch lineup that makes rolling out of bed on a Saturday worth it. And if you’ve got a sweet tooth, their homemade bakes will sort you right out. Vegan brownies, banana bread, and energy balls that don’t taste like sawdust.

1iv2hjz,https://www.reddit.com/r/MuslimCorner/comments/1iv2hjz/am_i_wrong_for_telling_him_to_be_a_man_or/,Am I wrong for telling him to “be a man” or anything else I did in this?,"Back story: My (F22) boyfriend (24 ab to be 25) and I have been dealing with some changes to our relationship and many ups and downs. He was born muslim. I am converting soon. I decided to start wearing the hijab, I am working on learning to pray, I stopped drinking (trying my best), I limit unnecessary conversations with men however i am pleasant with the ones i work with and go to school with, i read the quran almost every day. i am still working on things, but i am trying my best to do things right. doing things right, especially with my boyfriend, is very important to me. a few weeks ago i almost broke up with him bc his parents didn’t know about me and it felt wrong. I asked him to let me speak to his mom and he was very reluctant at first because his parents are very picky when it comes to potentials. (to the point of threatening to disown them if the parents don’t approve of who he and his siblings marry) he ended up telling his mom about me and how he thinks im pretty and we talk every day and hangout, etc. he told her that my family (catholic) invited him over for Christmas and that thats where he was when they came to visit last time they were here. she said she would talk to me and she asks him how i am doing often. she told him to get me prayer clothes and a prayer rug as well as an english Quran. Bless her she is so caring and giving and knowing that she did and said all this really warmed my heart and made me feel more comfortable seeing my boyfriend. Him and I said we would stop kissing and everything that comes after that. it was a struggle. at first he told me he hates change and it’s hard and whatnot. i didn’t really appreciate hearing that but i do understand because obviously we are attracted to eachother, however it seems that i can control my desires much easier. which isnt really a surprise considering the protections put on women specifically when it comes to the opposite gender. i suggested we spend less time together and stuff. he didn’t like that. he didn’t want us to treat eachother different he still wanted to be able to flirt and talk how we usually do which i agreed with and we ended up continuing our relationship that way. this huge change between us has not been easy for either of us and i regret to say that we have had some slip ups more recently and after which i would tell him the next day “it’s lingering on my mind and i don’t think we should do that again, i feel guilty, etc) he said he agrees. for valentine’s day i surprised him with a really cute dinner and desert i made, rose petals, balloons, flowers, pictures of us with cut out hearts. it was really cute and took me all day and he was very thankful for it like the sweet man he is. i did this at home so i could look cute and not wear my hijab and put on makeup, wear a nice dress. so i take accountability there for leaving room for temptation. he has known me for a while as a catholic non hijabi so to all of a sudden not let him see my hair till marriage just seemed… i guess like too much since i know he is the one. 

actually story: All that being said brings me to this: the next morning he takes my hand and places it on his private area. in my mind i was uncomfortable with it and did not want to go further because avoiding any sort of intimacy is really important to me because i have soooo much guilt and disgust about my actions prior to becoming religious like i feel i am in my heart now. i entertained it for a moment (because i did not want to hurt his feelings) and then pulled my hand away. a few moments later he put my hand back there again, and, again, i entertained it for a moment and then pulled my hand away. no words were spoken because i didn’t want to “rub it in” as he has told me not to do in the past. he has also told me “he hates feelings rejected” “he hates change” “don’t rub it in that we don’t do sexual stuff” that lady quote he said once because he was saying sexual/flirty stuff a day after me suggesting these changes to our relationship and i responding with “haram” and later that day he said he was annoyed and that i shouldn’t rub it in. anyways, after my second time pulling my hand away i noticed an energy change. i gave him some time and said i’d go downstairs and make coffee for us. when i come back up with the coffee he’s in the same quiet and blank face mood where i know something is wrong and he just hasn’t told me yet. i knew what it was about too i just figured id let him tell me. i had to get going to class bc i had a quiz so i ended up asking him what’s wrong. i don’t remember everything that was said but he told me “i just hate rejection” i eventually said to him something like “you tell me if anything makes me uncomfortable that i should tell you. then you tell me don’t rub it in and that you hate rejection. i asked you the other day when this wasn’t even happening that i was unsure how to handle a situation like (initiation of something intimate that im uncomfortable with) this and i asked you what should i do in that case and you told me just tell you what im thinking. now we’re here and i da too things from going further and you’re telling me you don’t like rejection. well i don’t like telling you i don’t want to sin and you put me in the situation to have to reject you. it does not feel nice for me to know that you chosing your desires over what’s truly good for both of us” i don’t really remember everything in order from that talk but that was the point i made and then he started bringing up my past and asking me how i could do things with other guys and asking how many guys i saw and when and all this stuff that is so irrelevant to our relationship and completely disregards and discredits how far i have come as a person and with religion and my beliefs. seriously it’s like i’ve done a 360 from who i used to be, alhamdulilah, and i don’t think i would have ever found myself where i am today without him and he always tells me how proud of me he is. anyways he brought up my last and i got pissed off. he then tells me “i’m worried about when we’re married that you will find another excuse to not be intimate because it use to be one reason then it was something else and now it’s this” THAT PISSED ME OFF he knows i was abused and Rped in my last excuse of a relationship and he knows better than anyone in my life the things i am still dealing with because of it, and he knows that i was very timid about intimacy when we first started dating for those reasons so for him to bring that up absolutely baffled me and screams that ha had no understanding of how that situation could have possibly felt which is wild because i KNOW he’s had his own messed up past that i could never imagine and i try to be delicate about. it also pissed me off because why does me not being intimate with you BEFORE MARRIAGE worry you about after marriage?? we’re not married! you do t get that from me till you put a ring on it and make a covenant with me and God. how can these ideas come out of a muslim man’s mouth!? anyways our convo ended shortly after that and i ended up calling him on my way to go study at a starbucks and told him “by the way you should probably know that our sex drives are very different and you tell me once your married you want to have sex like 20x a week and i can tell you right now i will not have the drive or the time for that and you cannot expect that from me so if it’s really such an issue for you, you should probably consider walking away if sex is that important to you” and i also explained in there that that’s totally understandable that sex is important to him, it is a right as a husband but it’s just not something that is equally important to me. i’d be happy with once a week personally. and i explained that to him then hung up. then he came to the starbucks i was at and told me to come out and talk to him so i got him a coffee and went out. he told me i was right and that he was sorry and that he shouldn’t have done what he did and that our difference in sex drives is not something that would make him end the relationship because that is not at all what’s most important to him. he gets offended when i think sex is so important to him and tells me it’s not even top 100 on the list of things he wants/likes about me. we were okay after he apologized but i was honestly still upset. i told him i just needed time and that it hurts my feelings that he tries to pass my boundaries when he knows it’s important to me to try my very best to do things right. so yea i was very upset still and felt a bit used/objectified/overlooked/disrespected to be honest. it felt like his desires were more important to him than my desire to do things right and not wanting to sin. that being said it’s not all on him, i still let him see me in nonmodest clothes. i do my makeup if i know only he will see me and im not going to school or anything. i let him see my hair always so yea i definitely leave room for temptation but not THAT much to him trying to initiate whatever he was going for by putting my hand down there. so yea i felt like shit and continued on going to school. then eventually it’s all i can think about and i’m analyzing the hell out of everything and i get mad. and i let him know im mad. i started telling him he’s supposed to be the leader in this relationship. if those things are so important to him then he should be the man in the relationship and tell his parents he wants to marry me/ask for their blessing. i told him that i should not be the one keeping us in check and that men are the leader of the house because they have a responsibility to protect us. but him initiating that stuff while also making sure i know he “hates rejection” does not put me in a safe place to reject him and keep us in line which should be his job. i told him word for word “be a man” followed by the same ideas i just mentioned. the next day he is upset about it still, saying that i should not say things like “be a man” that it’s disrespectful and there are other ways to say what im feeling. i guess i could agree with him but like at the same time i feel like it wasn’t very “leader and protector” of him to do what he did. i appreciate his almost immediate apology but its not the first time this has happened and im NEVER the one to initiate any intimacy. i just don’t know if its right that he’s this upset about what i said or if he just knows im right and i hurt his ego. idk. please give me your thoughts and please go easy i am converting soon and have changed SO much about myself as a person and no matter what any of you might have to say about poor character i am very proud about how far ive come all thanks to God.",1,1740173927.0,MuslimCorner,0,1.0,False

The Radford University College of Visual & Performing Arts presents the play ""The Totalitarians"" with five performances. ""The Totalitarians"" was written by Peter Sinn Nachtrieb. It is the brink of revolution in Nebraska. When Penny, a charismatic political candidate enlists the help of silver-tongued operative Francine, the campaign trail gets littered with sex, money, outright deception, and even a murder or two. This raucous, oh-so-dark comedy about Penny’s quest to implement her nefarious plans in the Cornhusker State is a hilarious send-up of modern politics that might look oh-so-familiar. Tickets are free and can be acquired online, by calling or during the week of the show, at the Theatre and Cinema Box Office.  
*Note: This play contains mature themes: smoking, drug use, adult language and discussion of overdose.*

I'm planning a 3-night trip to New York in May. I need to be in a few different, far flung areas on this trip (Brooklyn to visit family, Lincoln Center, possibly Harlem) so there's no one ideal area for me to stay. I'm considering the Beekman because I can book it with points and it's convenient to Brooklyn but, as a tourist, I'm concerned there might not be much else compelling in the immediate area. It's not my first trip to the city so I don't need to be near major tourist sites but I still want to make the most of my trip. 

I would especially like to be able to grab an excellent pastry for breakfast in the morning without straying too far from the hotel. Is there anything wonderful nearby or should I consider staying in a more vibrant part of the city? 

I welcome other suggestions of things to see in the area. I like art, all kinds of food, window shopping and quirky off-the-beaten-track sites.

1iv2gf9,https://www.reddit.com/r/MaximizeMe/comments/1iv2gf9/how_to_master_your_calendar_like_a_productivity/,How to Master Your Calendar Like a Productivity Pro,"**Ever open your calendar on a Monday morning and think, “Yikes... that’s a lot of boxes and no breathing room?”** Been there. Sometimes it feels like our schedules are out of control before we’ve even started the week. It’s like an epic boss battle… except the boss is our own planning skills.

 I used to be the person who double-booked myself for “coffee chats” and “brainstorm sessions,” then wondered why I had zero time for real work. Now, I treat my calendar like a puzzle—every piece has its place, and *trust me*, the end result is a million times more satisfying.

Here are some of my game-changing strategies:

• **Time Blocking:** Think of your day like Tetris. Each task is a block that fits into a neat little slot. If a piece doesn’t fit this day, it goes to the next.  
• **The 30-Minute Gap Trick:** Instead of scheduling meetings back-to-back, give yourself a 30-minute buffer to catch your breath, reflect, or just grab a snack.  
• **Color Coding Magic:** Assign a color for each category—purple for meetings, blue for focus time, green for personal stuff. That way, you can spot an overloaded day by just glancing at the colors.  
• **Say ‘No’ (Nicely):** Over-commitment is productivity’s worst enemy. If it’s not urgent or necessary, politely decline or postpone. Your future self will thank you.  
• **Check-Ins:** Take 5 minutes each morning to review what’s on deck. That mini-reality check can prevent most scheduling disasters.

Ever since I started using these methods, my days feel more like I’m behind the driver’s seat, rather than hanging onto the bumper of a runaway car. It’s made a huge difference in my stress levels, not to mention my sanity—and I still find time to binge a show or two (guilt-free). 

How’s your calendar looking right now? Does it resemble a Jenga tower about to crash, or a well-oiled schedule machine? It’s never too late to give it a little TLC. Sometimes, even the smallest tweak can have a major ripple effect on your entire week. And who doesn’t want a calmer, more productive day?",1,1740173847.0,MaximizeMe,0,1.0,False
1iv2f0b,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHD/comments/1iv2f0b/should_i_go_to_graduate_school_with_adhd/,Should I go to graduate school with ADHD?,"So I’ve always thought I was fairly smart. I scored 113 overall on the WAIS IQ test, slightly dragged down by inconsistent working memory and processing speed. I’ve assumed that this could counteract my ADHD. Since borderline dropping out of high school because of ADHD problems, I’ve turned my life around and managed a 3.96GPA in college so far in my senior year. I’ve done this by unleashing the intact parts of my brain, and it’s bolstered my confidence to the point that I am currently considering graduate school. 

I’ve always thought that as my brain develops toward maturity my ADHD symptoms would lessen. But now I’m 24 and still being quite negatively impacted by symptoms, and I feel like my ADHD may remain more severe than I expected. I’ve learned so many management strategies over the years that I’m literally doing everything right, yet I still have way too many problems. I get plenty of sleep, eat fairly well, exercise 4x/week, take meds, drink coffee as a stimulant, and have ample time for school because I don’t have to work a job while in college. Yet i’m having severe imposter syndrome b/c people of similar intelligence don’t need all these things. I feel stupid when interacting with them frankly because of my constant zoning out. There are certain things I will just never be good at, like grabbing knowledge from my brain to talk about my area of expertise in a coherent way, and completing my work in a timely manner due to inconsistent focus. I feel like I might be good enough for undergraduate studies but not grad school.  

Should I reconsider my grad school aspirations and just try to get a job with my bachelor’s degree? I’d love to hear from some else who’s overcome ADHD and finished grad school, ideally not someone who is simply a genius lol b/c that’s not helpful. ",3,1740173749.0,ADHD,6,1.0,False

Wouldn’t that energy be better used building your own life back? Aren’t you sick of crying alone and locking yourself in the bathroom during showers just to be the fuck away from him? Aren’t you sick of “submitting” to an abusive man? A con man is a con man for a reason, and they’re hardly even qualified for THAT job. They just rely on everyone else being a good enough person to be kept in the dark. Aren’t you disgusted? Don’t you hate him, deep down? Is it really worth staying so he can’t do what he’ll do no matter what state you leave him in? What he’s likely already been doing to your character and reputation to everyone he makes hate you for years? Don’t you hope he doesn’t wake up from drinking one day? What if you snuck out in the middle of the night instead of taking care of him while he’s hungover and went dancing with your friends instead? What if you could do anything you wanted, go anywhere you wanted, what would you do? What if you could spend your money how you wanted, what if you could speak how you wanted? Talk back when you feel like it? Tell someone the minute they make you uncomfortable and leave no room for the “misinterpretation” that gives them “permission” to violate you? What if you didn’t have him weighing you down. Close your eyes. It’s your birthday and he’s been gone for years. What does it look like to be healed? What does it feel like to be calm and safe and loved? What does it feel like to have a partner who lets you sleep in for the morning, brings you coffee? Helps you with chores? What if the only thing standing in your way was fear that he has given you, and nurtured every day?

I was using edibles 3-4 nights per week during football season and eating like crazy—coffee daily, sweets on weekends, even eating close to bedtime—but never once had a GERD flare-up. I even lowered my PPI dosage and slept flat without issues.

A month ago, I quit cannabis to reset since I was starting to feel a little off from constant use. Now, my GERD is back with a vengeance. I still react to trigger foods, but the weird part is that I ate the same foods while on edibles and had zero issues.

I also had an endoscopy while using edibles, and everything came back normal. My therapist and PCP think this might be anxiety-related (I have really bad OCD) and are suggesting I try 5mg of Lexapro to see if it helps.

It just feels too ironic that as soon as THC left my system, my GERD returned. Has anyone had success with edibles or SSRIs for managing GERD? Would love to hear experiences.",3,1740173231.0,GERD,4,1.0,False

* slip pillowcase
* perfume (maison louis marie, le labo, ds & durga, etc.)
* trending beauty items -- *gifted me summer fridays jetlag mask when it launched. there was also a time gifting glossier was ittttt*
* out-of-the-country self care & beauty finds (vitamins, tret, sunscreen, nuxe body oil, etc.)
* local NYC or Miami dessert (lady M crepe cake, supermoon croissants, pionono's pavlova, etc.) -- *avoiding since we're cutting a cake at her mom's*
* black denim jacket with custom embroidery
* custom planners & stationary
* courant charging tray
* pest control kit -- *she and her dad made a ""care"" package to help me through my first mouse problem*
* items for the home from MoMA design store

When we woke up this morning, we discovered the power was out, except a bit of emergency lighting in the hallways, only one elevator was running, and the parking garage gates were on a generator. Everything at breakfast was cold except the Omelet station (the workers making omelets were amazing, have to give credit), which was running on gas, plus some coffee that was hot. We were told the power would be back on by 9 - still wasn’t on by 9. We were told the power was out for a couple of blocks. We all needed showers, but couldn’t as there was no hot water. It was increasingly cold in the hotel, it was about 20°F outside and losing heat quickly. We finally decided to pack up and head out early, and after waiting a full hour for the one working elevator, we had to get a manager to intervene so we could get our luggage to the parking garage. We left, and late as noon, the power was still out. 

My question - how should we go about seeking a refund for a night of our stay? We had booked via Expedia, but when we spoke with the hotel, they said they had no access to their computers anyway because of the outage. Do I call Hilton corporate? Expedia? Do I even have a claim?

Usually we are scheduled 10+ partners on holidays but this Presidents’ Day we had about 6 partners in the morning and at one point we were down to a 3 person play. One person double barring with cafe and mobile wait times up to 40min. One person doing front and warming with a line out the door of customers + food for all the cars in drive + mobiles. And one person on dto and window (was supposed to be making their own drinks for drive but isn’t the best multitasker). Anybody else experience something like this? ,1,1740172971.0,starbucks,0,0.67,False

To preface, I am lactose intolerant and made a mistake this morning getting my coffee with whole milk instead of lactose-free milk. I didn’t realize that mistake until I drank a quarter of my coffee and began feeling the need to use the restroom. During this time, my boyfriend texted me to check in as he usually does in the afternoons. I told him that I wasn’t doing so great and that it was most likely due to my coffee. He asked me if I needed him to pick up lactaid before he came home from work and I said maybe. I also told him that my stomach was killing me, but I told him that I’ll be fine. 

Then, he asks if I’m still at work and if i needed him to drop off some pepto bismol. I told him no and that I was feeling better. In addition, I told him that if he comes over to my work then he also won’t have any time for lunch. Instead of listening to me, he proceeds to bring pepto bismol to my work. I repeatedly told him that he shouldn’t come over and that I was fine, but it was too late. He was already at my work and parked AT THE FRONT WHERE EVERYONE CAN SEE US. I met up with him and grabbed the pepto bismol. I thanked him and he said it was no problem before leaning in to kiss me goodbye (WE WERE STILL AT THE FRONT). I told him not to kiss me because of where we’re at and he understood and returned to his work. 

I got really upset because this is another example of him not listening to me again. I also feel like he indirectly aired out my business to my coworkers by dropping off the pepto bismol at the front of my work and tried to kiss me where everyone can see us. After he left, I thanked him and also expressed how embarrassed I was. I him to not do this again. 

I feel conflicted because I know he was only trying to help, but I’m also upset and embarrassed. I feel like he doesn’t understand social cues because this isn’t the first time he has embarrassed me like this. I’m tired of his actions and honestly need a break from him. We’ve agreed to take some time apart from each other because he has been getting on my nerves this past week. Regardless, I just don’t know if I’m being ungrateful and if I should apologize.

This list is as complete as I can make it, hopefully as more people perform the rite we will have more published accounts of it to analyze and study.

‘The Abramelin Diaries’ and ‘Thoughts on Abramelin’ by Ramsey Dukes.

‘The Sacred Magician’ by William Bloom.

‘After the Angel’ by Marcus Katz. Also ‘The Magick of Abra-Melin’ by Marcus Katz in ‘Llewellyn’s Complete Book of Ceremonial Magic’.

‘Conjuring Demons for Pleasure and Profit’ by Alex Sumner.

‘The Spirit-Magick of Abramelin’ by Aaron Leitch’

‘An Abramelin Ramble’ by Bill Heidrick, located at:

‘Abramelin Introduction’ (https://enochian.org/abramelin.shtml), ‘Abramelin Diary Notes’ (https://enochian.org/market/articles/abramelin/abramelin-diary-notes.html), and ‘Abramelin Advice’ (https://enochian.org/articles/abramelin-experiences-diary-notes-how-to-do-it/abramelin-advice-on-performing-the-operation/) by Athena.

‘The Magician and the Holy Guardian’ by Israel Regardie in the book ‘Angels & Mortals’ compiled by Maria Parisian.

‘Holy Guardian Angel’ edited by Michael Cecchetelli; particularly the chapters ‘After Abramelin’ by Aaron Leitch and ‘Passing Through the Void’ by Frater Ashen Chassan.

‘21st Century Mage’ by Jason Augustus Newcomb. 

‘The Magick of A Dark Song’ by Duncan Barford is not a practitioner’s account, but rather a look at Abramelin through the cinematic lens of ‘A Dark Song’, a movie about an Abramelin operation that manages to both completely corrupt and misrepresent the rite yet also somehow presents a compelling portrayal of ritualized redemption. 

There are a myriad of videos on YouTube on the topic of Abramelin, here are a few I found valuable and/or interesting:

I made it once and it went pretty well, but my one issue was that the coffee jelly was hard to put in it and didnt hold its shape great when cut. 

When I made it I let the jelly set separately and then tried to cut it to size the bottom of the crust, because i thought the liquid jelly would soak the crust before it set and ruin it?  
Would it? Maybe a crust of nuts and graham crackers could hold it?

This raucous, oh-so-dark comedy about Penny’s quest to implement her nefarious plans in the Cornhusker State is a hilarious send-up of modern politics that might look oh-so-familiar. Tickets are free and can be acquired online, by calling or during the week of the show, at the Theatre and Cinema Box Office.  
*Note: This play contains mature themes: smoking, drug use, adult language and discussion of overdose.*

1iv1ve1,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1iv1ve1/exfriend_copying_my_life_and_not_sure_how_to/,Ex-friend copying my life and not sure how to handle the situation,"I (F24) am in law school and was roommates with another law student, Kate (F24), during my first year. Before school started, we met some of the same people, a couple of whom became my best friends. Even though we were placed in different sections and had different classes, I always invited her to hang out with my friends from my section.

A few weeks into school, my friend Anna texted me to see if I was going to the beach with her and Kate. Kate never mentioned it to me, and when I asked if she had plans, she lied and said she was going on a solo walk—when in reality, Anna was picking her up. When I confronted her, she claimed she liked one-on-one time with friends, started crying, and canceled her plans. It was weird, but I tried to be understanding.

Then it became a pattern. She started inviting my other close friend, Natalie, on frequent runs, telling her she loved that they had “their own thing.” When intramurals started, I joined a softball team with Kate. She later excitedly told me she also joined an intramural soccer team—something we had both talked about wanting to do—but didn’t extend the invite. The next day, some guys at school asked if I wanted to play, so I joined. At every intramural game, she basically ignored my existence.

She kept making new friends while still reaching out to my closest ones for coffee dates and hangouts—without me. I still never excluded her, but one day, after she told me she was getting coffee with a friend, I had also wanted to go study at a coffee shop so I invited my friend Anna and another girl to go study. We ended up at the same place. Later, Kate said she wanted to talk, started crying, and said she felt left out. I immediately flipped the conversation and pointed out that she was the one doing that to me. She admitted she had been doing that but said she didn’t know why. At one point, I asked “is the reason you’re inviting my friends to hang out without me because…” and she finished my sentence and said “to make up for the time you’re spending with them? No, I’m not doing that.” This all seemed like jealousy and insecurity at this point.

She then told me she was upset that I joined intramurals because she “wanted it to be her thing,” yet she had no problem copying things from my life—trying to be best friends with my closest friends, applying to a big law firm I liked (despite always wanting to be a public defender) and made sure to tell me about it, and now, signing up for the exact Madrid study abroad program I told her about a year ago. Only four students get to go, she had never expressed interest in Spain before, and there were 15 other cities to choose from.

I thought I wouldn’t have to be around her again because she moved out after our first year, but now she’s going to be around in an incredibly small group of people. She also continues to reach out to my closest friends to hang out. She also has other friends now so I don’t know why this continues to happen but it’s driving me crazy.

Now, she’s reaching out to the other two girls in the program, trying to make plans for us all to get together to have drinks. The two other girls are best friends and know Kate (I’m not sure how well) but don’t know me at all. I want to talk to them about why I’m feeling so uncomfortable about this whole thing but I’m really scared it will backfire. I also assume they will all live together abroad while while I live with my boyfriend, but I worry that if I want to be close to the two other girls, I’ll have to deal with her too.

In a perfect world, Kate would decide not to go abroad but I don’t have any control over that. Is it worth it to call Kate on this or just tell her how I’m feeling? Do I try to tell the other two girls how I’m feeling or will this just potentially create unnecessary drama and make me the bad guy? I hate pretending everything is fine but not sure there is much else I can do.",2,1740172396.0,FriendshipAdvice,2,1.0,False

People assume it takes eons to truly discover what someone’s about, like you need to sit with them through a few heartbreaks, share childhood trauma tales, maybe even get stuck in a road trip catastrophe together.  
Nah.  
Give them five seconds, maybe even less if they’re the loud, obvious kind, and you’ll receive all you need to know.  
  
And this isn’t about “vibes” or whatever people say when they ne savent pas de quoi ils parlent. This is straight-up psychology. Well, mainly. Some of it is simply paying attention and common sense.

  
**1. The way they step into a room says way too much.**

  
Some folks barge in like they’re looking for applause. Others creep in like they’re expecting to go undetected. Then you’ve got the ones who appear to scan the room like un Terminator, pesando quién vale la tona charlar.  
The one who craves attention — big, exaggerated motions, too-loud voice, maybe a theatrical pause before they say anything revolutionary. Either an extrovert or someone who badly craves approval.  
The one who wants to vanish sticks to the outskirts, scarcely makes a sound, could be nervous, might simply not like people. Hard to tell yet.  
The balanced one — moves like they belong, not like they need to prove anything, says hello, makes eye contact, doesn’t try too hard. These folks are the rarest breed.

  
**2. What They Do When Nobody’s Looking ? That’s the real them.**

  
Everyone’s polished and presentable while they’re in the limelight, but the second they believe nobody’s looking, that’s where you catch the good stuff.  
Do they tune out and gaze at their phone the second they’re not talking ?  
Are people still engaged even when it’s not about them ?  
Do they appear annoyed when someone else takes the floor ?  
People who only perk up when they’re the focus of attention are walking red flags. The solid ones don’t require regular confirmation, they’re simply there, there, without requiring a prixe for it.

  
**3. How They Handle Conversations : Give-and-Take or Spotlight Hog ?**

  
Have you ever had a discussion when the other person never asked a single question ? Like, you could tell them you just escaped from a hostage situation, and they’d still pivot back to their weekend plans.  
Or the ones that stop you off mid-sentence simply to brag about themselves.  
Or, heaven forbid, the one-uppers. You remark a little accomplishment ; they’ve done twice as much, but better, and probably blindfolded.  
Good talks flow. It’s not just one individual hogging the entire thing.  
Some folks approach every encounter as a single podcast episode.

  
**4. Small Promises Tell You If They’re Full of It**

  
Ignore the major obligations. Look at the small things.  
“I’ll text you later.” Do they ?  
“I’ll send you that link.” Did they ?  
“Let’s grab coffee soon.” Was that merely polite filler ?  
If they can’t follow through on something as easy as answering when they said they would, how do you think they gmanage genuine responsibilities ?  
People who are steady with the minor things, that’s le vrai test.

  
**5. How They Treat People Who Can’t Do Anything for Them**

  
Biggest character test on the globe.  
Watch how they speak to waiters, cashiers, janitors, customer service personnel.  
Watch what happens when they don’t believe anybody significant is listening.  
If someone acts snippy, dismissive, or straight-up rude to individuals they have nothing to benefit from, they are not a decent person, simple as that.  
The ones that still offer fundamental respect, even when theren'est no societal advantage, they are the true ones.

  
**6. Do they stay calm or get defensive ?**

  
People who blow out on the least resistance are extremely tiresome.  
Say, “Hey, I actually don’t agree,” and suddenly they look like you ran over their dog.  
Give modest constructive input, and they act personally offended.  
And the greatest one is when they attempt to gaslight you. “Wow, you’re really overreacting.” No, guy, I just stated I loved pineapple on pizza.  
If someone can’t manage fundamental disagreement without allant into une tempête, imaginez ce qu'ils sont comme dans une véritable crise.

  
**7. The way they wrap up a conversation tells you what kind of social skills they have.**

  
People don’t think about how they end a discussion, yet it’s strangely informative.  
Abrupt vanisher – one second they’re engaged, next second they’re gone. No farewell, no “nice talking to you,” simply poof.  
Awkward fumbler – Suddenly realizes they need to go, but wastes another five minutes bumbling through a sloppy escape.  
The “wait, one more thing” person – Can’t let go, continues dragging things out, like a poor sequel that should’ve never been developed.  
The seamless closing – Ends naturally, gives a nice final impression, maybe even tosses in a “Good talking to you, let’s catch up soon.”  
Socially aware individuals tie things up without making it odd (not in all circumstances).

  
**Final thoughts**

  
People believe they can disguise who they are, but they really, truly ne peuvent pas.  
All the clues seep out, how they walk in, how they act, how they treat people they don’t need.  
Now that you know what to look for, c'est difficile de ne pas le voir.  
So next time you meet someone fresh,  
They’ll show you precisely who they are.

  
**Wait a sec.**

>*To the ravine, marked with a new cross""*

>*– Carolyn Kizer, “Ingathering”*

I watch the feeds scroll past midnight  
Each image too familiar now.  
Streets I once wrote about safely  
from my desk, my coffee      growing cold  
while history seeps through the screen.  
My hands shake. Words scatter     like broken glass.  
Nothing makes sense in the old ways.  
Each headline more fractured than the last.  
I remember those who came before,  
To the blood-haunted villages.

Morning in the city square. Quiet.  
The café windows still wear plywood  
though the protests ended months ago.  
The owner flinches at car doors slamming.  
Time should heal this      they say  
but some wounds refuse their stillness.  
Each day we wake to count  
what's missing        what's changed  
our eyes drawn despite ourselves  
To the crumbling walls, still pocked

They paint over history with fresh coats.  
Hide the deeper stains beneath progress  
and development     and looking forward.  
But paper remembers what flesh won't:  
each document        each photograph  
each list of names     growing longer.  
I catalog the patterns forming  
like bruises under skin.  
Truth seeps through anyway  
With a spray of bullets.

At night I dream of other writers  
who watched their world unravel  
line by line     word by word  
until language itself betrayed them.  
Did their hands shake too? Did they  
taste metal in their mouths  
when truth became illegal?  
Until there was nowhere left  
but that final pilgrimage  
To the ravine, marked with a new cross.

I totally forgot to get pics of the PB and raspberry jam on the tortillas! I was hoping for cornbread but the tortillas worked fine.

The candy bar was great, not sure I've had that one before to be honest, a Wunderbar. Sweet, with caramel, chewy, and had some crispy bits in there too.

The fruit cocktail was great and actually had a cherry in it, although not visible in the pic.

Coffee was great made with 1/2 cup milk and a teaspoon of sugar. Haven't had the chocolate drink yet, maybe tomorrow morning for that!

Saved the drinks for another day. Tic tacs were as expected as well.

This wasn’t a conscious manifestation since I wasn’t “trying” to manifest my friend. However, I had been thinking that I should text her and hangout cause we hadn’t seen each other in about 3 months even tho we are on the same campus. 

Yesterday, I randomly bumped into her while on my way to class and she tapped my shoulder cause I didn’t notice her at first. She said hi to me and I said hi back and we went our separate ways. I thought that was strange because I know the law and I knew I had been thinking of getting in touch with her. 


Since yesterday I was thinking about her even more and in my head I kept thinking “we should hangout “ , “I should text her and we should get coffee and chit chat” but I never acted on any of it cause I kept getting busy with my own work.

Today I went to get coffee and she walks in right infront of me for the second time in a span of 24 hrs and this never happens because we are on a campus of 23K students. As I said , before yesterday, I had last seen/hungout with her 3 months ago and never even passed by her after that. 

I saw her sitting at a table by herself so I went to say hi and she told me to sit and talk with her because the person she came to meet was coming 30 mins later. We talked and caught up with each other’s life and we decided to again hangout in a more planned manner sometime in the coming weeks. 


This was an eye opener for me too that the law is always working. I never said affirmations in the present or felt like it was done and that we are definitely gonna hangout. It was always effy like yeah I should reach out and see how that goes, maybe our schedules align and we hangout or we dont. I have manifested things before but incidents like this only drill my knowing in the law. ",5,1740172047.0,lawofassumption,0,1.0,False

All it takes it that one cup, and I'm back down the rabbit hole. Is a ""Coffeeholic"" a real thing? I feel very little compulsion to drink ethanol; I have a stocked bar at home and rarely touch it; there's bottles that have been sitting for 10 years, and beers in the fridge over a year old that I've had to pour down the drain. I only drink when I go out, and its two beers socially. Coffee? Espresso? Cappuccino? I can suck 'em down my friend... you'd better believe it.

I switched to tea, and have been drinking 5-6 cups a day to kill the urge... but wow is it calling me.

Obviously then, I use words that my family used while growing up because it’s what I know and sounds natural to me. My accent is definitively Jersey (with a bit of NY), but nowhere near as thick as some of my older friends and relatives from Brooklyn and Hudson county. 

Word examples, talking food, I’ll say: calamad (calamari), pasta fazool (pasta e fagioli), mootsadel (mozzarella)

I don’t know if it’s just the people I know or what, but outside of the northeast part of the state people just rag on my accent. Like repeating back certain words to me like “coffee”, “water”, or “salt” and laughing about how I pronounce the “aw” sound. It really makes me feel insecure about the way I sound. I mainly get this in Morris county with Gen Z or Millennials either from there or one of the surrounding counties. Maybe it’s a younger demographic thing? 

I wouldn’t make jokes about or to the face of somebody from another area, state, or even country who sounded different from me. I don’t know where some people find their nerve. 

Anybody else feel me on this?

=================

The fluorescent lights buzzed overhead, casting a sterile glow over the tile floors of St. Jude’s Rehabilitation Center. The night shift was quiet, save for the occasional cough or the distant murmur of a television left on low. Most of the patients were asleep, lost in dreams or nightmares of the past that had brought them here.

A man moved through the dimly lit hallway, his steps slow but deliberate. He wore a plain hoodie, the hood drawn up just enough to shadow his face, his hands stuffed deep in the pockets. The staff had seen him before, a volunteer, maybe? A visitor? No one ever questioned him, and by the time anyone thought to, he was gone.

Room 204. 

He paused at the door, barely making a sound as he slipped inside. A young woman laid curled up on the bed, her breath shallow, sweat glistening on her skin. Withdrawal: her body was waging war against itself, the desire for drugs clawing at her from the inside.

The man knelt beside her, his fingers curling slightly as something beneath his skin shifted, coiling around his arm. A faint, unnatural whiteness flickered just under the fabric of his hoodie.

""You're gonna be okay,"" he murmured, though she didn’t wake.

Then, as if the shadows themselves had come alive, something unseen moved from him to her. It wasn’t violent. It wasn’t loud. Just a whisper of something other, something purging, something healing.

Eddie Brock stood, his job done. The woman’s breathing steadied. The fever broke. She wouldn't know what had happened by morning, only that the cravings had dulled, the sickness had eased.

One room down. More to go.

He stepped back into the hall, fading into the dim glow of the exit sign, and moved on to the next soul in need of saving.

Eddie had been doing this for weeks, jumping from rehab to rehab, curing those in need of it. Yet, although he managed to help so many with their cravings, he had not been able to free himself from his craving. The craving of his guilt.

He could be doing so much more with these new abilities, helping so many more, yet he wasn’t. All because he was selfish and didn't want that life, he didn't wanna rise to the ranks of the many heroes in New York or deal with any of their problems. He just wanted to live, but the guilt continued to bite and scratch at him.

He moved through the halls like a ghost, unseen, unacknowledged, a specter of quiet redemption. Each time he stepped into a new room, each time he let the thing inside him do its work, a part of him hoped, maybe this time it’ll be enough. Maybe this time, the weight in his chest would lighten. Maybe this time, he’d be able to forget the lives he refused to save.

But it never was.

Eddie slipped into Room 217. A man in his forties laid sprawled on the bed, gaunt and hollow-eyed, twitching in his fitful sleep. Track marks ran up his arms, fresh ones among old scars. Eddie had seen this before, this guy had relapsed, probably more than once.

He crouched beside the bed, sighing as the white tendrils coiled from beneath his sleeve, unseen by the world but felt by the broken soul before him. The tendrils pulsed, purging the poison from the man’s body, severing the chains of addiction. Eddie barely even watched anymore.

His mind was elsewhere.

Every night, he told himself this was enough. That this was the right way. He didn’t need to punch supervillains through brick walls or throw himself into the same fight as Spider-Man or Iron Man or whoever else. He was helping.

So why did it feel so damn hollow?

Because it was easy.

Because it was safe.

Because he knew, deep down, that this was only the bare minimum.

The man on the bed let out a deep, shuddering breath, his body finally at ease. Eddie pulled back, standing as the tendrils retracted beneath his skin. Eddie sucked in a deep breath and without waiting a moment more, he left the room. Instead of hunting for another door, Eddie made his way towards the closest exit. The sun was soon to rise and with it, he needed to be gone from here.

=================

Archer Lyle sat in the corner booth of a run-down diner, her laptop open but untouched. The screen glowed with half-written notes, theories, and late-night speculation, but her eyes were fixed on the city outside, where the real story was unfolding.

Something was happening in New York, something big.

The numbers didn’t lie: rehab centers across the city were reporting inexplicable recoveries. Addicts, some of them chronic relapsers, were waking up clean. Not just in recovery, but free from withdrawal, from cravings, from the poison that had ruled their lives. Clinics were baffled. Doctors whispered about medical impossibilities. And the streets, normally flooded with desperate souls, were thinning out.

It wasn’t natural.

Archer knew a story when she saw one, and this had all the makings of a career-defining break. A mystery man, a miraculous cure, and no one with the guts to ask the right questions.

She took a slow sip of her cold coffee, scrolling through the reports she’d gathered. Witnesses were scarce. Most of the cured addicts had no memory of what had happened, just that one night, they were suffering, and the next morning, they weren’t. Some spoke of a shadowy figure slipping in and out of rooms. A man in a hoodie. No face. No name.

That’s what made it perfect.

She’d chased enough dead leads to know when to back off. But this? This wasn’t a dead lead. This was a ghost, and ghosts always left behind something. A trace. A whisper. A thread to pull.

She wasn’t about to let this one slip through her fingers.

=================

Detective Jefferson Morales leaned back in his chair, the dim light of his office casting long shadows over the stacks of case files cluttering his desk. The air smelled of old paper and burnt coffee, the radio in the corner crackling with NYPD chatter. Outside his window, the city pulsed with life, another night in New York, another case no one wanted to touch.

Except for him.

He exhaled slowly, rubbing a calloused hand over his face before turning back to the evidence board on the wall. Photos of rehab centers, medical reports, red strings connecting a dozen different locations. The pattern was undeniable. The numbers didn’t add up. Too many addicts, from too many places, were getting clean, all without medical intervention. No withdrawals. No relapses. No explanation.

Jefferson had been in law enforcement long enough to trust his instincts, and everything about this case screamed superhuman involvement. Likely the work of mutants.

He stood, crossing the room to pin another report to the board. All of the incidents had one thing in common: a mysterious figure slipping into rehab facilities late at night. No clear description, just a man in a hoodie. No forced entries, no signs of struggle. People went to sleep addicts and woke up cured.

It wasn’t a crime, not yet. But whatever was happening out there, it was unnatural.

Jefferson had seen what happened when superpowered individuals played god. Miracles always came with consequences.

And he needed to find out what they were.

=================

Eddie pulled his hood tighter as he stepped out from the center into the cold night air, his breath misting in the glow of a flickering street lamp. The city never slept, but in places like this, forgotten corners where the desperate clung to whatever scraps they had left, it felt quieter. He turned to leave, ready to disappear into the city, when a voice stopped him.

""Hey you, you're the guy who's helping folks right?""

Eddie stiffened before turning around to the source.

A girl stood at the mouth of the alley, arms crossed, her sharp eyes locking onto him like she had been waiting. She couldn’t have been more than seventeen, her dark purple-dyed hair messy, her hoodie oversized and full of holes. She looked like she hadn’t eaten a real meal in days, but there was fire in her stance. A stubbornness that wouldn’t break easy. Eddie exhaled, his mind already racing through escape routes. 

""You got the wrong guy, kid,"" he muttered, turning away.

""I don’t think I do,"" she shot back, stepping closer. ""I know what you’ve been doing. You’re the one making people better, aren’t you?""

Eddie hesitated. She was too confident, too sure. Most people barely noticed him. But this girl? She’d been watching. Paying attention.

""I don’t know what you’re talking about,"" he said, forcing his voice to stay even.

""Bull."" Her jaw tightened. ""I’ve been staking out places for three nights. People go in sick, screaming for another hit, and then suddenly? They’re fine. No one knows why. No one remembers why. But it’s you, isn’t it?""

Eddie clenched his fists in his pockets. He could walk away. She had no proof. But something about her, about the desperation in her voice, kept him rooted in place.

""Why do you care?"" he finally asked.

Her expression faltered, just for a second. Then she swallowed hard and took another step closer. ""Because I need you to do it again.""

Eddie frowned. ""Who?""

Her voice wavered. ""Jenna, she’s my-"" 

A pause, just long enough for Eddie to notice. ""She’s my best friend. She’s hooked, and I-I can’t lose her.""

Eddie closed his eyes. He should walk. He should.

But he knew he wouldn’t.

“Take me to her.”

Andi’s breath hitched, like she hadn’t expected him to agree so fast. For a moment, the fire in her eyes flickered, replaced by something raw, hope. Then, just as quickly, she steeled herself and gave him a sharp nod.

“This way,” she said, already turning on her heel and disappearing down the alley.

Eddie followed, his footsteps silent against the cracked pavement. The city loomed around them, the hum of traffic distant, the occasional shouts of the lost and broken echoing through the streets. Andi led him with purpose, weaving through side streets and back alleys, moving like someone who had spent too many nights navigating the underbelly of New York.

“How bad is she?” Eddie asked, breaking the silence.

Andi hesitated before answering. 

“Bad,” she admitted. “She was clean for a while, y’know? We had this plan, get jobs, get outta here, but…” 

Her voice trailed off, her hands curling into fists. “Some dealer got her hooked again. Now she barely eats, barely talks and when she does, it’s just her asking me to help her score.”

Eddie didn’t respond right away. He’d heard this story before, too many times. People trapped in a cycle they couldn’t break, chains too strong to escape on their own. That’s why he did what he did. Because no one else could.

It did ease the guilt a small bit.

They turned a corner, and Andi stopped outside a boarded-up building. The old sign above the door had long since faded, but Eddie could tell it had once been a corner store. Now, it was just another abandoned husk, a hiding place for people who had nowhere else to go.

“She’s inside,” Andi said.

Eddie exhaled and stepped forward, pushing the door open. The smell hit him first, stale sweat, mold, the faint chemical tang of burnt foil. 

Jenna was curled up on a filthy mattress in the corner, her hoodie pulled tight around her thin frame. Her skin was pale, her hands trembling even in sleep.

Andi knelt beside her, brushing hair from Jenna’s face. 

“Jenna,” she whispered. “I brought someone, someone who can help.”

Jenna stirred, eyelids fluttering, and Eddie felt the thing inside him shift, sensing the sickness, the poison clinging to her like a parasite. He stepped closer, kneeling beside her. Andi watched him carefully, her expression unreadable.

Eddie pulled his hood down.

“Jenna,” he said, voice steady. “I need you to trust me.”

Her eyes opened slowly, glassy and unfocused, dark circles carved deep beneath them. For a moment, there was no recognition, just the hollow gaze of someone who had been lost for too long. Then, her body tensed, her hands weakly pushing against the mattress as if to sit up, but the effort was too much.

“Andi?” Jenna’s voice was barely more than a rasp. “Who?”

Andi reached out and squeezed her hand. 

“He’s here to help,” she said, but there was an uncertainty in her voice, like she wasn’t sure she even believed it herself.

Jenna let out a breathless laugh. “Ain’t no help for people like me.”

Eddie had heard that before. He didn’t argue. He didn’t offer empty reassurances. He just reached out, his fingers barely brushing against Jenna’s arm. The thing inside him surged, sensing the poison running through her veins, the damage it had done. He let it spread.

A pulse of white flickered across his skin, barely visible under the dim light of the abandoned store. Jenna shuddered, her breath hitching, her body instinctively trying to reject what was happening to her. Andi pulled back slightly, eyes wide. Jenna gasped, a strangled sound escaping her throat as something unseen worked through her system. Her fingers clawed at the mattress, her whole body seizing up for a moment before suddenly: relief.

Jenna slumped back, her breathing steadier, her shaking slowing. Her skin, once clammy and pale, gained a touch of warmth. Eddie withdrew his hand, exhaling. It was done. Jenna blinked rapidly, confusion knitting her brow. 

“I…What just…” She swallowed. The craving, the ache, the relentless need, it was gone.

She sat up slowly, as if expecting the sickness to come rushing back but it didn’t.

Andi stared at Eddie. “What the hell did you just do?”

Eddie pulled his hood back up, standing. “What you asked me to do.”

Jenna lifted a trembling hand to her face, touching her skin like she didn’t recognize herself. 

“I don’t feel it anymore,” she whispered.

Andi turned back to her, eyes shining. “Jenna?”

“I don’t want it anymore,” Jenna said, her voice cracking. Tears welled in her eyes, but for the first time in a long time, they weren’t from pain. Andi’s breath hitched, and without thinking, she threw her arms around Jenna, holding her tight. Eddie turned away, heading for the door. His job was done but before he could step out into the night, Andi called after him.

“Wait.”

Eddie paused.

She pulled away from Jenna, standing. “This thing you do. You could help so many more people.”

Eddie exhaled, his shoulders heavy with the weight of words he had no interest in saying: I know.

But he didn’t turn around, didn’t answer at all.

Shes a 7 year old former street dog who was found emaciated in Colorado Springs and adopted. She hates walks and being outside due to her history but has always been the best dog, super cuddly and sweet and best friends with my dog. 

This week out of nowhere she started destroying stuff in my house, first she chewed off the corner of my $1800 coffee table and then chewed up a pillow. This all happened while I was doing laundry in my bedroom 20’ away. 

I have a converted, dog proof space that I normally keep other clients but because of her needs and her bond to my dog I’ve started keeping her in my house because she’s basically family and isn’t super social. 

I don’t want to put her in the dog proof space because she would be stressed out by the other dogs and I also don’t want to lose her as a client. Any tips or strategies? I’m not sensing any specific triggers. ",0,1740171762.0,RoverPetSitting,10,0.5,False

Back in 2019, I was working at a call center in my late 20s. One evening, mid-call with a client, I suddenly realized I was struggling to speak. I could understand everything they were saying, but when I tried to respond, my words wouldn’t come out right. It wasn’t slurred speech, more like I just couldn’t form the words properly. I mumbled something and hung up, then slowly typed a message to my coworkers explaining I was having trouble talking and needed to go home. They were concerned and asked if I needed a ride, but I otherwise felt fine and drove myself home. By the time I got there, my speech was completely back to normal.

For context, I had Bell’s palsy as a kid (not sure if that’s relevant). I also once had a weird episode where I woke up in the middle of the night with the overwhelming sensation that time was moving too fast—everything felt sped up. It wasn’t just grogginess; it lasted for about an hour before fading.

One thing to note is that I was drinking a ton of coffee while working at that call center late at night, but I wouldn’t expect that to really cause something like this. Also, I never talked to a doctor about it.

I’m not looking for a diagnosis, just wondering if anyone has ever had anything similar happen to them. If you’ve had odd speech issues or strange perception episodes, I’d be curious to hear about your experiences.",1,1740171658.0,stroke,1,1.0,False

1iv1iwe,https://www.reddit.com/r/Xcaret/comments/1iv1iwe/full_review_of_9_day_hotel_xcaret_stay/,Full Review of 9 Day Hotel Xcaret Stay,"My husband and I stayed at Hotel Xcaret from Feb 9-20. With the price we paid we had high hopes, but also are easy people to please. I have stayed in many 4-5 star resorts, but nothing as unique as Xcaret. I will keep my review as organized as possible:

1. Check in: upon check in we were suppose to be on the family side, river suite. We booked this as it was the better price. The reception desk offered us a 30% discount to upgrade to the adults only building, Agua, as they said king beds were limited on family side and the Agua building is much quieter. We agreed and were very thankful for it! Check in was quick, our bags were in our room by the time we got there and we got a quick tour. We booked through Costco, so we did not do the promotional sales pitch.

2. The hotel grounds: it took us probably 3 days before we looked at mostly everything. We kept finding little hidden cave areas with swim spots and water slides. We absolutely LOVED how it all was so immersed in the wild and felt so calming. The beach was always so beautiful and hot, with servers bringing drinks. We loved the infinity pool and the view of the ocean behind it. My favourite thing though was that even though the hotel was at max capacity, we never had to fight for a chair or space anywhere. We never waited to be seated for dinners and we never waited at a bar for drinks. It is an amazing resort, I've never seen one quite like it. My husband and I both used the gym in the Agua building and it was great. It had everything we needed and there was always extra water or towels. We also used the outdoor circuit which had 3 of the 10 obstacles  cut out due to renovations but it was still a fun thing to do nonetheless. And speaking of construction, yes there was a lot but it really wasn't that bothersome to us. We did not hear it from our room and yeah you could see workers out during the day but it wasn't like they were stealing our beach chairs or sunlight. So it wasn't bad. The one thing we did hear from our room that was a bit confusing... a baby crying next door. We were under the understanding that we were in an adults only building, but we also didn't want to complain and ruin someone else's stay so we didn't say anything.

3. Restaurants and Bar: I am a pescatarian and my husband is a vegetarian so I cannot speak on any meat products, but the fish was all amazing! I loved eating at Bio, and I loved how all the restaurants had vegetarian or vegan options. It was the first resort I've been to where my husband and I weren't stuck eating the same food for a week straight. I personally loved everything we ate. I am not a picky eater but I usually end up with food poisoning because of how much I adventure with my food, this time I did not! I felt perfectly fine all 9 days. My husband is a bit more picky and said he found less that he liked, however compared to other resorts we've been to he did like the food here more than anywhere else. He enjoyed the food at Xcaret Park a lot! We loved going to the bars and trying their signature drinks or asking if they could make us something unique. They were so fun to be around and seemed like they genuinely loved their jobs. We had a great time when we hung out at the bars. The biggest complaint about this is there isn't much nightlife. We wish there was a club or someplace to dance/hangout more.

3. The Parks: We did Xplor Fuego, Xenses, Xcaret Park (2 days) and Xel-Ha. We loved the parks so much, and had a fantastic time. I think the coolest feature about the hotel and parks is the photo package. If you do any of the parks plus the hotel, you just have to get the picture package! It is well worth it, especially if you're anything like my husband and I who never take pictures. My favourite thing was swimming with the sharks in Xcaret Park, and the toboggan slide at Xplor Fuego. It was also nice that most of the parks included a buffet as the days were long and tiring. We found there was a lot more walking than we had expected. We are both athletic people so it wasn't a big deal but if we had our kid with us it would have probably sucked a bit lol.

4. The Spa: We did not do any massages because the prices were insane, but we did do the hydrotherapy. It made for a great relaxing afternoon, and the spa was beautiful! We did not feel rushed or crowded by anyone, and we would have done it a second time if we were there longer. We would highly suggest trying it!

5. Overall: my husband and I will definitely be back. Regardless of all the bad reviews I see others give, this resort is so unique and amazing. The fact that I wasn't waiting for a drink or my dinner was so nice and the transportation for the hotel itself was a nice touch so we didn't stop at 5 different hotels along the way. We loved all the wildlife, the scenery and how relaxing this resort is. The rooms were comfortable and always stocked well. I loved my morning coffees in the hammock on the balcony, and I really did not want to leave!

And FYI, our ride to the airport when we left took 2.5 hours because of construction so when they say plan to leave early they mean it. Another friend took their airlines transportation and it took them 4 hours due to stopping at other resorts. Just some helpful info!

I've known this guy for a few years now—we met through a shared hobby and get along well. We occasionally meet up in a group and sometimes one-on-one, but it's always very PG. There have been some flirty comments from both sides, but nothing that makes me feel like he's genuinely interested in more.

Early on, I gave him an ""in"" by mentioning that if he ever wanted to grab coffee, he should let me know. He did, and we've met up a few times, but it’s usually me initiating now. He's a great conversationalist, emotionally intelligent (which is important to me), and someone I feel really comfortable around. He also makes solid eye contact and is fully engaged when talking to people, which I really like.

We’re not super close, and I initially brushed off any potential attraction because I thought I wanted someone more extroverted. But over time, I've realized he does open up a lot when he's comfortable.

He’s on dating apps but doesn’t seem to put much effort into them. Lately, he’s been on my mind more, and I see a lot of what I want in a partner in him. But I can’t tell if he sees me as anything more than a friend. In my experience, if a guy is interested, he usually initiates more. He knows I’m always up for catching up because I’ve told him, but he doesn’t really take the lead.

Part of me thinks I should just leave it alone and not risk making things awkward, but another part of me wonders if I should say something. I’ve paused all my dating apps because I’m more intentional about dating now, and I’m realizing I value real-life connections over swiping.

Should I just move on, or is it worth putting it out there and risking potential awkwardness?

Today he had to get a crown repaired and finally admitted again (two years after the last incident) that the bad breath is due to large gum pockets. He shrugs and claims there's nothing to be done about it. 

Whenever I bring up his bad breath he says it's just some salsa he ate, etc.  He's such a kind man and wonderful guy but he becomes childish about this issue running out of the room when I finally say it's gotten so bad I just can't kiss him. He says he brushes so that's all he can do (he brushes for like 30 seconds, I talked him into a water pick and he shoots the water in and instead of using it to irrigate between his teeth he just swishes the water around his mouth for a second and spits it out and that's it. ""That's my process""

Meanwhile, The smell gets worse after he eats meat or just whatever he does all day at work - he won't brush after lunch.  we are both 62, I started using a water pick twice daily when my gums went from a 2 to a 4 and they improved back to 1s and 2s within 6 months. My dentist tells me I have perfect teeth and gums. I love taking care of my teeth. I feel so bad to tell him when his breath is bad, because of his reactions,  that most times I just try to ignore it and literally hold my breath to give him a kiss. The sour smell is just the biggest turnoff. 

I'm despondent over this because it's not looking like he's willing to do anything about it. He waited two years between his last tooth cleanings - maybe he's scared of what they'll say ? I don't know because he shuts down. Am I too obsessed with teeth hygiene? I get my teeth cleaned every 4 months 🤣 because I want to keep all my teeth in old age and it also cleans off the coffee stains. but If someone told me I had bad breath I would do anything and everything to fix it ASAP.

I still don't know where this sound came from. It could be that the excess water was already out, so maybe I was pushing an air bubble. First time it happened. I haven't tried another shot yet. I hope the pressure gauge isn't broken.

* Price for locals at £5 (£2.50 for kiddos)
* Venue will be transformed: improvements to terraces, lounges, café, gift shop.
* Weddings and corporate events re-opening later this year.
* New beach bar planned to open in the summer.
* They're talking about postcodes, inflation and gruesome murders over on The Argus.

So my Breville Bambino Plus just randomly started making terrible espresso the other day and I'm trying to figure out if the machine is broken or there's something I'm missing. No change in beans or grind or prep or anything else. But suddenly the coffee coming out just tasted terrible (super bitter).

The BBP is a fairly dummy proof machine. The only real variable I control is the grind size. You grind your beans, put them in the portafilter basket, tamp, use the ""Razor"" leveler to remove excess grinds (should result in 18g in the portafilter according to Breville), then hit the one or two shot volumetric controls which control the extraction time.

This process had worked fine until it didn't. I've since done several cleaning cycles and a couple descales (with Breville brand cleaning tabs and descaler) and there was no change.

I've tried tinkering with the grind size using my Timemore Sculptor 064 grinder using settings from 2 to about 5 (espresso grind should be 0-4 on the Timemore), all tasted terrible ranging from overly bitter terrible (on setting 2 as in the video) to overly thin terrible (on setting 5).

Let me know if you see anything strange in the video that might indicate a machine problem. Otherwise any troubleshooting steps you think I should try. Appreciate the help!

For the video above, here's the details:

Taste: Like butt no matter the grind setting  
Roast date: Dec 31, 2024  
Roaster: Gimme! [https://www.drinktrade.com/products/eternal-flame](https://www.drinktrade.com/products/eternal-flame)  
Roast level: Medium-dark  
Bean details: See link above under Roaster. Used grind setting 2 on the Timemore Sculptor for the video  
Dose: I don't usually weigh in favor of using the Breville Razor which should result in 18g. In this case I did weigh it and it in fact came out to 18g.   
Yield: Using the 2 cup button I got 32g of liquid  
Time: See video

I 22F have had a group of friends (all girls the same age) which fell out with one person about a year ago. We would get along just fine. People meeting up together from time to time. Then people started to not like this one person because they hadn’t met up or messaged in a long time. Let’s call them Emily. I was like oh that’s a bit weird but I’m sometimes like that so it’s not super unusual. Then it came to Emily’s birthday which was a night away in a certain city. Of the friend group, me and another girl, Sarah, were invited. Two girls were real pissed about this- Gemma and Talia. Gemma was pissed also because “Emily knows I always go to (that city).” Emily said they weren’t invited because she hadn’t spoken with them in like quite a long time. She also hadn’t with me but I was at uni and I don’t really message people anyways. 

Sarah said she could go and then decided not to as she was asked to work then. But we were used to her flaking on things anyways. Since that birthday, Sarah, Gemma and Talia did not like Emily at all. They would sit and say that she was horrible for not inviting them over and over again. Then there were 2 instances where Emily had walked past them in a shop or something and not say hi. This was now the topic of conversation. I just felt this was getting dumb. I asked Emily about this (big mistake) because I was like- surely she would’ve said something. She said she had said hi but they must not have heard one time and then she didn’t see them the other time. 

I had then had my birthday. I was like- who do I invite? I thought, maybe everyone will be civilised and invited them all. I told Emily she could bring some of her other friends so she wouldn’t feel left out if they started their shit. We all met up. Everything seemed fine, but it was like me, Emily and her friends at one side of the table and Sarah, Gemma and couple of other friends at the other side so it seemed quite separate. But, they were engaging with Emily and her friends so it was fine. Then Sarah, Gemma and the others on one side of the table all got up and said they were going home. This was about 10pm. A bit early for my standards but idk. I asked why, and was given the reasons. 
I was like- okay. Emily was not happy about this. It was like really abrupt I guess. We had only been there like a couple of hours. Emily started to shout “why are you leaving?” At them which was a bit mad tbh. So that was that night.

Emily then decided she was sick of them and unfollowed them on social media. I didn’t know she had done that and went to a bar with her and a couple of her other friends. At this bar I saw Sarah sitting with some of her friends. Every time I walked by the table and tried to make eye contact to say hi, she was looking somewhere else. I was really annoyed because we were at a table quite close to them and her boyfriend kept looking at our table so I knew that she knew we were there. The next day I was messaging Gemma and said I was really annoyed she wouldn’t say hi to me and that it was really rude and horrible. Gemma told me Emily had unfollowed all of them on social media. Gemma then told Sarah and then Sarah and I met up for coffee to speak about it. She expressed that she was overwhelmed with Emily being there and she was crying and having a panic attack about it. She then said I should’ve messaged her to ask why. She then repeated something I said to Gemma which was I felt like it was high school behaviour. Which I did. I felt like it was petty and immature. We also discussed my birthday situation, in which she brought up different reasons for leaving than what I had been told which is odd. I left that coffee feeling shop feeling like a cunt. Like I was being unreasonable and had no empathy for anything.

But the longer I sat with what she said, the longer I didn’t agree with her reasons. Why didn’t she just say hi at the bar? Why didn’t they just say oh- we’re leaving in a bit. Okay- fine. But it was just annoying and bothersome.

So now I live in the aftermath of this. Emily and I are still good friends, as well as Gemma and I. I will speak to Talia on the odd occasion but I no longer speak to Sarah. Well, she decided not to speak to me when I went to a meet up and she was one of the people there. However, it’s been over quite a few years of her giving lame excuses for not going somewhere or not doing this or that. Little backstory: Gemma originally was annoyed at Sarah for never turning up for certain things and then going to events with her other friends or family and never being 100% truthful with things sometimes. This included her health stuff which she has struggled with her whole life but we’ve only ever got 2% of the whole story because she’s so secretive. Emily had told me that both Gemma and Sarah would talk about each other to her. And then suddenly- they are best friends again. Best friends as in posting ‘my love’ with a picture of them on insta or something like that. And I’ve never heard Gemma speak bad of Sarah again. 

Anyways, the problem I have now is being good friends with both Gemma and Emily. Being with Gemma, there are some snide comments from her friends about ‘never guess who I seen today’ and then her explaining I’m still friends with Emily (probably to stop them talking shit about her). Emily doesn’t usually speak about them unless we’re just speaking about things in the past or going through that whole situation again. 

I keep seeing posts about not being a good friend for being friends with someone who was horrible to your friends but I can’t seem to see the problem anywhere. Is everyone not at fault? Was this high school behaviour or am I being horrible? I need outside opinions. I just feel like it’s friends falling out of friendship (which is normal) but some of them demonising others because that’s just what you do to people who no longer vibe with you anymore. Pls make sense of this. I’m so confused.

It’s been really cold here (in the teens and twenties) in NY and during the week I take my F80 to work. It’s like a 15 minute drive and most of the time the temp gauge doesn’t move at all by the time I get there, which I interpret as the car not being warmed up enough. I know that it’s not good to drive the car short distances without it getting up to temp, so once I park up at work I’ll typically let the car idle for 5 minutes or so that the temp gets up to 160 at least. Also, if I stop for coffee which is a few minutes away from my house, I’ll let the car idle rather than turning it off. The longevity and health of the motor is important to me so  I tend to overthink these things thus, I’m curious what the general consensus on this is. Am I overthinking this? Should I just shut it off and worry about something else? 

So long story short - if the temp needle hasn’t moved, should I keep the car running till it moves a bit or is it ok to just shut it off and move on with my life?",2,1740170997.0,BmwTech,5,1.0,False

So I took to the internet trying to find a homebrew recipe that I could get some inspiration from and it's much closer to a 'cola' in color & taste.  Details on why I choose the additions at the bottom of this post.

* 2 cups of water
* 3 cups of sugar (I used two cups of cane sugar and 1 cup of demerara/turbinado)
* Zest and juice of 1/2 orange
* Zest and juice of 1/2 lime
* Zest and juice of 1/2 lemon
* 2 Cinnamon sticks, broken into pieces
* 3 Green cardamon pods, broken open so seeds are released
* 2 Tablespoons of coriander seeds
* 1.5 Star Anise, broken apart
* 1 Tablespoon of bitter orange peel
* 1/4 Teaspoon of fresh grated nutmeg
* 1/4 cup browning sauce. Specifically [this one](https://www.amazon.com/Grace-Browning-Gravy-Seasoning-Sauce/dp/B08T9XLBSN?th=1)
* 1/2 teaspoon of vanilla extract

If you don't have cardamon pods, coriander seeds, or whole nutmeg use these ratios: 

* 0.5 Teaspoons of ground cardamon 
* 1.5 Tablespoons of ground coriander 
* 1 Teaspoons of ground nutmeg

Instructions

1. In a large pot combine the water, sugar, citrus zests, cinnamon, cardamon, coriander, star anise, bitter orange peel, and nutmeg and place over medium-high heat.  Whisk until the sugar has dissolved and then bring to a boil for 2 minutes.  Reduce the heat to low and simmer for 10-15 minutes.
2. Remove the pot from the heat, and allow to cool slightly before handling. Strain the liquid through cheese cloth or another fine mesh strainer into a container.  A coffee filter set in a funnel works as well.  Add the citrus juice (there should be between 1/3 and 1/2 cup of juice from the fruits), browning sauce, and vanilla extract.
3. Add to taste the Nuka-Cola syrup and Soda Water/Seltzer water.  Tonic water is not recommended. My taste is one part syrup to 4 parts water, so 3oz of syrup to 12oz of water.

[Here's a picture of the end result](https://imgur.com/a/5paVIo8)

Details on my additions & changes.

* For sugar demerara is usually used for homebrew sodas, but its harder to find locally.  Turbinado is essentially the same thing but with a more caramel flavor vs demerara's tofee.  Turbinado is also widely available locally.  You can use entirely Turbinado if you want, but I prefer the 2 cups of regular sugar.
* The original cookbook recipe doesn't specify black or green cardamon, and I saw some using black cardamon which isn't correct in my opinion.  Green cardamon has an herbal & citrus flavor where black cardamon has a smoky flavor which doesn't fit.
* I don't think I could taste the coriander seeds in the oringinal recipe, so I added much more. Coriander gives a nutty aroma & citrus flavor.
* 2 Star Anise in the original recipe was too much licorice flavor for my taste, so I reduced it to 1.5.  You could use 1 large Star Anise and 1 small one to achieve 1.5 instead of breaking one up.
* Bitter Orange Peel is going to be the hardest ingredient to find for most people.  My homebrew & wine making shops all have them where I live, I recommend checking those first.  If you can't find any locally you can buy it online.  If you don't want to spend the money you can substitute the peels of 1/2 an orange, but the flavor won't be the same.
* Nutmeg I found to be in a lot of cola recipes online, and specifically the 7x formula for Coca-Cola.  Fresh nutmeg is always better but it is expensive so ground is acceptable.
* SUPER IMPORTANT do NOT get the vegetable stock version of browning sauce for obvious reasons.  The correct browning sauce is one made with water and caramel sugar.  You can also find homemade recipes online, but its not worth the effort in my opinion.  Check your local super market's ethnic isle for the Jamaican browning sauce.

Fair warning there is mention of blood, smells, and loss.

I recently tried Elix. I’m on month 2 of taking it and for clarification on directions on my bottle, I am only to take take it once a month 5 days before i am due to start my period. I take 6 drops from it in my coffee or tea. While it has a distinct taste, I find it enjoyable. I started taking it to get control of my hormones since I was diagnosed with PCOS and I have been trying to get pregnant since 2022. 

January 2025- I took my first dose during this month. My hormone acne was there but not as bad, my hairs on my chin still popped up 3 days after plucking. I took my dose from Jan. 13 - 18 once a day. I noticed I did not start my period on the day I normally start 19/20, and discovered I was pregnant for the first time on the 21st. However, I miscarried 3 days after my first positive. And was bleeding through February 19. 

February 2025- since the miscarriage I had been bleeding for about a month now. I received my second package of elix so I said to myself fuck it, I’ll use it while I’m still bleeding, see if it helps. 2 days into taking my dosage my bleeding has finally come to a slight pink with no clotting! And my cramps have finally gone away! This is a relief, because the first week of bleeding I smelled  rotten and I had some really bad cramping and back pain. 

My OBGYN appointment is set for March to confirm if a D&C is still needed since my last 2 blood draws have been confirming an upward trend for HCG but a downward trend in progesterone. (Deeming my fetus as Non-viable). Which at my appointment I’m hoping a D&C is no longer needed as my miscarriage happened naturally. Which means I may be able to try again soon.

For what colors would you go in that room? What color for the things I plan to buy?

**Chapter XII**

**Business and Expenses.**

The next morning Astral thankfully did not wake up on Ukiko’s ceiling. He did however wake up with a six year old girl cuddled up against his arm. He was frozen for nearly a half hour before Ukiko wandered out to make her coffee, she saw the two and smiled. Then she quickly came in and picked up Ariane and sat her back in her own room. Astral then got up and went across to his apartment to get a shower and get dressed. He came back and knocked on the door before entering. Ukiko answered, still in her pajamas, and offered him a cup of coffee.

Astral accepted the drink and stepped inside, then they sat at her kitchen table. Ukiko almost immediately put some papers in front of him and gestured for him to look them over.

“Buildings?” Astral asked, “Offices?” He had to recall what he had originally asked after the past couple of days. “Right, I need a place to be a private investigator.” 

Ukiko nodded and stood, then left for about twenty minutes. When she came back she had showered and changed. Astral had to check the time on his phone and just chuckled.

“What?” Ukiko asked.

“Did you even let the water hit you?” Astral chuckled.

“I’m efficient.” Ukiko shot back, “You took almost forty minutes, how much water did you waste?” 

“None, I got clean.” Astral countered and noticed Ariane walked in and sat at the table, Teddy was firmly under her arm and she barely had her eyes open. 

“You want to go with us today?” Ukiko asked, “We’re going to look at places for Astral to open his business.” 

Ariane nodded, “Hungry.” The girl mumbled, “Who put me back?” 

“I did.” Ukiko said, “You can’t just climb into someone’s bed without asking.” 

Ariane yawned and nodded. 

“You get scared?” Astral asked.

“Lonely.” Ariane said. 

“You get lonely and you’re with me you can climb in with me.” Astral smiled.

“Same with me.” Ukiko smiled, “Eggs?” 

Ariane nodded. “Ketchup too!” She started to wake up and was looking at Astral’s coffee. 

“You wouldn’t like this.” Astral chuckled.

“Yes I would.” Ariane smiled, “Please?” 

Astral shook his head but put the mug forward to let her take a sip, “Careful, it’s hot.” 

Ariane took a quick sip and scrunched her nose. 

Astral laughed, and froze as a memory unfolded in his mind. He was young and sitting at a table with his father. He wanted to try his dad’s drink, it was black coffee. His dad let him and he hated it. His dad laughed and then something kicked the door to their home in. Young Astral screamed and when he finally came too, Ukiko and Ariane were trying to hold him in place.

“I’m...” Astral struggled for the word. “I’m back.” 

“Where did you go?” Ariane asked while hugging his leg.

“Lost in a memory, a long suppressed one.” Astral took a breath and tried to ground himself by cycling through what his recovery teacher had taught him. He gave Ariane a pat on the head as he did so.

“Are we safe?” Ukiko asked, “This wasn’t a response to daemons?” 

Astral shook his head. “Just a memory that six year old me wanted desperately to forget.” He sat down and put his face in his hands. “Just give me a minute.” 

“Okay.” Ukiko said warily. 

He heard her go back to cooking and looked up from his hands briefly to see Ariane peering back from putting her face in her hands in a similar manner. He smiled and lifted his head up, she mimicked him. Astral reached out and touched her nose.

“Boop.” He smiled.

Ariane giggled. “Are you really back now?” 

Astral nodded, “Took me a moment, got lost in sadness.” 

“That’s okay, we’ll always find you.” Ariane smiled and turned as Ukiko put a plate of eggs with ketchup on the table in front of her. 

“Waffles okay for you? I can toast them pretty good.” Ukiko offered with a proud smile.

“Sounds amazing.” Astral laughed and looked up at the ceiling trying to maintain his focus. He began to mutter something he had remembered with the old memory.

“What?” Ukiko asked as she put a plate of three waffles in front of him and sat a similar plat at her seat.

Astral looked at her in confusion, then realized he had been louder than he had intended. “Sorry, old motto my...” He paused, “...Family motto.” 

“I didn’t hear it all.” Ukiko smiled, “And it sounded German.” 

“Mom was from the Southern US with heavy French blood. Dad was born in Germany. I got taught English, French and German as a kid. Still fluent in those.” Astral laughed, “Translated it means something like, ‘In Service, freedom. With Family, prosperity.’ or something like that.” He frowned, “I need to figure that out.” 

“Maybe it’s in the videos?” Ariane suggested.

Astral nodded, “Likely. I’ll look tonight.” 

He quickly dug into his food and was done before either Ariane and Ukiko. Ukiko finished after him and they both waited for Ariane who managed to cover her pajamas and face in ketchup. Astral then waited for Ukiko to give Ariane a quick bath and get her dressed, as a result Ukiko’s own clothes had to be changed.

“Lesson learned. Major clothes change after the kid is dressed.” Ukiko sighed. 

Astral nodded, “Kids are messy, it’s kind of their thing.” 

“Don’t.” Ukiko pointed a finger at him. 

Astral chuckled and looked at the papers. “So this first one is down the street.” 

“Closest to walk to but smallest space.” Ukiko nodded as they left and started down the street. 

Ariane quickly stepped between the two and grabbed the hands of both adults. Then she would occasionally try to use them to swing a bit, but it didn’t last long before Astral simply picked her up and held her. 

“No swinging?” Ariane pouted.

“I’m not sure it’s good for Ukiko’s arm.” Astral nodded to Ukiko who was rubbing her arm that Ariane had tried to swing from. 

Ariane nodded, “Okay. Up?”

“What, you want to fly?” Astral laughed. 

Ariane nodded.

“Not now, might scare people.” Astral smiled.

“How about we go to a park after?” Ukiko suggested.

“Yes!” Ariane laughed, “I want to!” 

Astral laughed, “Good. You want to walk or just have me carry you for now?” 

Ariane paused to think. “I’ll walk after this one.” 

“Okay.” Astral smiled as they all came to a building with a small entrance that Astral was fairly certain he wouldn’t be able to enter. 

Ariane looked at it confused and tried to figure out how people got in. Ukiko even tilted her head, before crossing the office off their list. Then Ariane asked to be put down and simply held onto Astral’s hand. They went down to the local train station and got their tickets for the next stop. Astral noted several students for the local junior high school were also just boarding, no doubt they had overslept, but one was hiding something in his coat and the glint of metal caught Astral’s attention. He sat Ariane in Ukiko’s lap as he moved closer to the young man. 

The young man then noticed Astral and tried to slink away, but Astral was faster and stronger, he put the young man in a friendly looking grip and laughed as he pulled the kid close. The young man just looked up in shame. 

“For you?” Astral asked. The kid shook his head. “To hurt someone else?” Again the kid shook his head. “For someone else’s protection?” The kid nodded. “A bully?” He shook his head again. “Give me something I can use, please.” 

“There’s something at the school.” The kid hissed, “No one believes me but it lives in the walls and smells like rotting blood.” 

Astral frowned but nodded, then held his hand out. The kid handed him a kitchen knife and sighed. 

“School’s name?” Astral pulled out his notepad as he slid the knife away. 

The young man gave him the name, address and the name of his homeroom teacher. Astral noted it all down, he wasn’t sure what the kid was doing, but he would look into it. 

“Look, you don’t seem like a bad kid. Get some talismans for protection, I’ll look into this. Kinda part of my job.” Astral nodded to the kid, “Okay?” 

The young man nodded. 

“And you’re not getting this back, but look out for my office and your parents can pick it up.” Astral advised, “I’ll let you know where it is when I get them.” 

The young man was clearly confused, but nodded. Astral returned to his seat and sat down.

“Was that what I think it was?” Ukiko asked.

Astral nodded, “The kid’s scared of something at his school, he was trying to protect others. I’m gonna check it out tomorrow.” 

Ukiko nodded, “I can hold onto it.” 

“No, I got credentials to get away with some weaponry, you don’t.” Astral explained, “Also, that reminds me, there’s an immigrant worker on the streets, some cop took her paperwork and won’t return it.” 

Ukiko clicked her tongue in disgust, “I know the type. I can look into it, I guess. Got a name?”

“Chechara!” Ariane smiled, “You met her!” 

“Oh, the Spanish speaking lady. I liked her.” Ukiko nodded, “I’ll talk to her tomorrow. Sound fun Ariane?” 

Ariane nodded. 

They sat quietly and Ariane nodded off for a little bit before they had to get off for their spot. Astral noted it was a quick ten minute ride for him, and even found he recognized the area of the city. 

“Not too bad a walk for me.” Astral noted, then picked up Ariane, “But her little legs...” 

“Hey.” Ariane giggled, “I can walk it too.” 

“Faster by train.” Ukiko said. 

“Don’t meet as many people on the train.” Astral countered. 

“You do.” Ukiko smirked.

Astral went to argue, but grumbled to himself.

The three of them walked a little farther down, to a building where a tarot card reader was sitting outside. Astral immediately recognized the woman and walked up with Ariane in his arms and sat down. 

“Madame Kōun no Neko.” Astral smiled, and the woman lifted her head.

The yokai woman smiled gently, “I see you found her.” 

Astral chuckled, “Other way around. This is Ariane. Ariane, this is Madame Kōun no Neko, an older hero and seer.” 

“Bah.” Madame Neko scoffed, “I read fortunes.”

“Oh...” Ariane smiled.

“Maybe another time?” Ukiko urged the two on.

“Right, we got stuff to do. Just wanted to say hi.” Astral smiled.

“It’s appreciated.” Madame Neko smiled.

“Wait...” Ukiko squinted, “Were you Black-Fire?” 
 
Madame Neko paused and nodded.

“My mother had a ton of your posters and a few stacks of cards.” Ukiko smiled, “It’s good to meet you. And thank you for helping.” 

Madame Neko seemed to blush, “You are welcome dear. I hope your mother treasures those cards.” 

“I do in her place, I lost her sometime ago. But I keep it all safe.” Ukiko smiled.

“A dutiful daughter then.” Madame Neko smiled and reached up and pulled a card down and handed it to Ukiko. “A rare one, I doubt she had it. Add it to her collection for me, will you?” 

Ukiko took the card and her eyes widened, “There’s only a few of these.” 

“For a good reason. Posing in that bathing suit was stupid, but it sold overseas and helped the country recover.” Madame Neko sighed. “But I don’t need it to sit around reminding me of lost days.

Astral tried to peek over Ukiko’s shoulder, but received a glare from her as he did so. He slowly stepped back and gave an exaggerated worried look to Ariane who giggled at his goofy behavior.

“Thank you Madame Neko. You are very kind.” Ukiko wrapped the card in a tissue and bowed deeply. 

“No, stop that.” Madame Neko hissed and returned the bow. “I am simply glad someone remembers me and hopefully those I worked with.” 

“Metal Emperor, Tokasatsu Marcher, Da Fy-Ya!” Ukiko gave an uncharacteristic giggle. “My mother loved them all.” 

“I don’t recall a Metal Emperor.” Astral blinked, “What did he do?” 

“He was an American expatriate. He claimed to be ‘hyper-evolved’ and had technology that made even some of what we have today seem slow.” Madame Neko laughed, “He helped, but didn’t stay. No one saw him after the Purge forces were destroyed.” She frowned, “I believe he died saving people, I can’t imagine anything else. There’s no way he would remain quiet for any length of time.” 

Ariane sniffled, “You’re not alone. We can visit.” 

“Oh?” Madame Neko smiled, “I appreciate the thought child, I’m simply old and wishing for more familiar times and faces. I am happy for any visitor though.” 

Astral smiled, “Ariane can tell when you’re lonely, so if she drags me off to find you, don’t argue when we steal your time for an afternoon.” 

“Oh, quite a gift.” Madame Neko smiled, “Have this.” She handed Ariane a lollipop shaped like a cat’s head.

Ariane grabbed it and smiled, “Thank you!” 

Ukiko also smiled at the woman, “I think I might find you for my own reading sometime.” 

“Oh, I can give you a very good piece of advice.” Madame Neko laughed and jerked a thumb to Astral, “Great catch, don’t let him get away.” 

Ukiko’s face went scarlet and when she finally turned to look at him, Astral was equally red faced, the yokai woman was laughing happily as the three quickly walked away. Astral was about to speak at the same time Ukiko was but both noticed and went quiet. Ariane just giggled as they stopped and looked at the next building on their list. 

Astral was about to suggest entering when he noticed a direct neighbor was a nightclub and the walls were right next to the building he would be in. He nodded to the neighbors and walked up to the club doors.

“Sorry, not open. Band is practicing.” A large oni woman with golden skin said.

“I’m thinking of renting an office next door. Want to see what the sound is like.” Astral explained.

“I’ll go stand in the office.” Ukiko said.

“Ah...” The bouncer nodded, “Let me ask the boss.” She went inside and a few moments later she came back with another woman who clearly had multiple tails and a wicked smile on her face that vanished when she saw Astral.

“I don’t need a nephilim bothering my customers.” She snapped. “Or my band.” 

“Not here to bother people.” Astral said, “I just need to know how soundproof the walls are.” 

Then his phone rang and Astral sat Ariane down when he saw it was Ukiko. He answered it and heard the blaring sounds of music on the other end and already knew the answer. 

“I got it!” Astral said as loudly as he could before deciding to text her. “How is it that loud inside, but we can’t hear it on the street?” 

“Don’t worry, you’re clearly not going to be a neighbor.” The yokai woman said.

“Music!” Ariane smiled and ran inside, past the bouncer and the owner.

“Gah!” The woman shrieked.

“Let me get her.” Astral brushed past both women and followed Ariane. 

When he got inside he was surprised to find a tea house with a “band” of Shamisen players and with a few unoccupied taiko drums, then he saw the speakers put blatantly up against the neighboring wall. He picked up Ariane who was enjoying the shamisen music, and turned to face the owner as she rushed in.

“You are trespassing!” She snapped.

“And you’re tanking your neighbor’s ability to rent his rooms.” Astral pointed to the speakers placed at very odd intervals. “Tell me, can you survive being sued into oblivion?” 

The woman paused, “We want privacy, this is a yokai club.” She hissed.

“Doesn’t justify your actions, you can put that on a label.” Astral snapped, “No wonder this place was a cheap offer. I might just take it to spite you.” 

“I’ll crank the music.” She leaned in. 

“And I’ll punch the wall out.” Astral countered flatly, “That’ll make your little game go bye-bye really fast.” 

The yokai woman stepped back, she clearly hadn’t expected to be challenged. She nodded, “Fine, rent it. See if I care. Kara, back to the door.” 

The oni woman nodded, “Come, let me at least see you two out.” 

“Thank you!” Ariane giggled, “Sorry about running in, I just like the music.” 

“So do I.” Kara smiled, “Please don’t tell anyone about what’s in here.” 

Astral nodded, “So long as she doesn’t keep ruining her neighbor, I won’t have to.” 

Ariane nodded, “That’s not nice.” 

Kara led them out and bowed, “Sorry. Usually Miss Sarai is easier to deal with.” 

Ukiko was waiting outside for them, “So how loud is it inside?’ 

“Unique levels of loudness.” Astral nodded with a glare back. “Keep it on the list. We can get better sound proofing after if I need to.” 

Ukiko nodded and made a note on her phone. “The owner’s had a rough time renting. Neighbor has sound proofing towards the city streets but not the other buildings.”

“Uh-huh.” Astral nodded, “I’ll be able to fix it if I have to.” 

Ukiko looked at him and squinted, “You know something.” 

“Shhh.” Ariane nodded, “We can’t tell.” 

Ukiko nodded and gave Astral a pointed look. He nodded back and motioned to continue their journey. What seemed like minutes later, his phone rang and he blinked in confusion.

“Right, mattress delivery.” He nodded, “I almost forgot about that.” He then answered the phone and handed Ariane to Ukiko.

“Astral.” He spoke into the phone.

“Ah, yes. We have your mattress, but no one seems to be answering.” The delivery man said. 

“Go ahead on in. Don’t mind the mess, it got broken into last night. You got my most valuable possession right now.” Astral said, shaking his head at the stupidity of the situation. “And I’m like a twenty minute walk away.” 

“Oh, it is open.” The man said, “Also there’s two big guys in suits using your name downstairs.” 

Astral sighed, “Give’em my number on the way out please, I think I know who they are.” 

“Okay, if you’re sure.” The delivery man said, “We got it in the front room, you marked you would assemble it yourself?”

“Yes.” Astral affirmed, “And thank you for calling, I wasn’t expecting you to drop it off until later.” 

“No problem.” The Delivery driver said as Astral heard a door close., “We just closed the door, we’re heading out. Thank you for buying at Tom’s!” 

The call ended and Astral sat on a nearby bench. Ukiko and Ariane joined him, then his phone rang again.

“Brisco County Morgue, you stab’em we slab’em.” Astral smirked.

A deep laugh rumbled, “I guess we deserved that.” Akira’s voice boomed. “Look, boss wants to know if you got time to talk. He picked up some news about these daemons.” 

“I’m a bit busy right now. Is this an honest request or a ‘get in the trunk’ request?” Astral asked.

“Honest.” Akira said, “You impressed the boss with the whole saving our asses thing.” 

“Ok, look, I’m out and about. Can you tell him I can speak tomorrow? If it’s about daemons, I need to know, just can’t get free right now.” 

“Yeah.” Akira sounded disappointed, “Got a new car already too. This time bulletproof.” 

“Sounds like a smart choice.” Astral smiled, “All right, I know where you guys are. I’ll be around noon tomorrow, okay?” 

Akira sighed, “I’ll let the boss know. Have a nice one and if you’re with his little girl, you treat her right.” 

Astral laughed, “Copy that.” He then ended the call. 

“My father’s men?” Ukiko asked.

Astral nodded, “Your dad seems just as worried about the daemons as everyone else. And he’s got information.” 

Ukiko nodded, “Yakuza do defend their territory.”

Astral nodded, “And I make a good loose cannon to aim at them.” 

“Or a good friend?” Ariane asked.

“Let’s hope so.” Astral smirked. “Next place?” 

“Food.” Ukiko showed the time on her phone. “I need something to eat.”

“Man, that did not feel like it took several hours.” Astral chuckled, “Okay, what’s nearby?” 

“Burgers!” Ariane pointed to a sign where an old western style “witch” was flying a broom and carrying a red bag labeled “Wanda’s” 

“Oh, I’m so down for a classic Wanda’s meal.” Astral smiled.

“I can live with that.” Ukiko nodded

The three walked in and made their orders. Astral covered the costs as a thank you for Ukiko letting him stay on her couch.  Ariane got a toy in her kid’s meal that was a classic ball in a cup toy designed to look like the mascot, Wanda the Witch controlling a ball. She spent most of the meal time splitting her attention between that and her chicken nuggets. Astral simply enjoyed a classic double patty burger and fries with the joy of a man who hadn’t had such a meal in months. Ukiko was happy with her chicken sandwich and salad. 

When they were done they were back on their trip and made their way to the next office option. It was thankfully nearby, around the block just a little bit. They were a little disappointed to find the entrance to the building was off an alleyway, which looked very insecure. Astral was very certain it was used to mug people at one point. When they met the landlord though it was a decidedly easy choice to make as he sneered at Ariane and Astral had to stop himself from reflexively punching the man’s nose in. It was a quick no to that spot.  

“I want to go back.” Astral said as he sat Ariane down as they left the alley.

“No.” Ukiko grabbed his arm. “We don’t need to provoke the weak willed idiots of the city.” 

“Why didn’t he like me?” Ariane asked, “He wasn’t lonely or anything, just mean.” 

Astral stooped down and picked her up again. “Some people are just mean, and some people don’t like kids. And sometimes they’re the same person.” Astral sighed, “Don’t worry, I’m not gonna have an office that won’t let you and Ukiko in.” 

Ariane smiled and hugged him.

Astral paused and hugged her back. “Don’t worry kid. I’m not going anywhere.”

Ukiko smiled as she watched them. “Last one is the farthest out of course, but it’s also the most expensive with good reason.” 

They walked for about thirty minutes before they came to a long row of three story buildings with small, multi-paneled windows. Astral looked them over quickly and understood the expense, they were truly modern, made in the last year. That meant they were up to code and had the most earthquake resistant structure and were rated to take high end hurricane force winds. He let out a whistle, noting how impressed he was.

“Come on, we actually get a bit of a guided tour here.” Ukiko smiled and walked in. 

A woman in a black business suit beamed as they entered. She approached and offered her hand to Astral, “Emmi Tanaka, you must be Ukiko’s client. Is this your daughter?” 

Astral laughed, “Well, more or less. She was on the streets, but no documents or anything.” 

“They all run away.” Ariane smiled, “I’m Ariane.” 

“Ariane, it’s nice to meet you.” Emmi smiled, “Ukiko, you didn’t say how handsome he is.” 

Ukiko turned red once again.

“Oh, you do want him for yourself then?” Emmi giggled.

Astral put up his hand, “We’re friends. Ukiko’s been integral in helping me adapt and keep Ariane safe.” 

Emmi nodded and frowned, “We’re old college friends. I didn’t mean anything by it, Ukiko.” 

Ukiko gave a huff, “I know, but literally everyone assumes it!” 

“Well maybe they see something you two don’t.” Emmi laughed, “But you’re here for the office for a Private Investigator’s office? Small, nothing too large, correct?” 

“Preferably fogged glass and partially scuffed up lettering on the door.” Astral cracked.

“I’m afraid noir styling is extra.” Emmi laughed. “A bit out of date too.” 

Astral wanted to frown, but Ukiko’s frustrated sigh made him laugh instead.

“This way.” Emmi said as she led them on. 

They reached a pristine stainless steel elevator when the front door shattered. They all turned to see a security guard approach a man in grimey, blood stained clothes. Astral’s vision honed in on the man’s twisted face.

“Bad man!” Ariane shouted as Astral handed her off to Ukiko.

He walked forward and his wings came out as he turned around. “Get into an office. Ariane, get Teddy out!” 

“Asty!” Ariane shouted as Ukiko followed Emmi to an office.

“Sir, put the weapon down!” The security guard shouted at the angry looking man in stained clothes, then he saw Astral. “I have this in hand sir.” 

“You need to run.” Astral said as he made himself fully visible to the guard’s senses.

“Wha?” The guard stepped back.

“That’s not a man.” Astral looked at the now manifested daemon, “Not anymore.” 

The guard looked back and screamed as he ran away. The secretary had run off seconds earlier.

“So you’re the one the Casterum was pissed about.” The daemon snorted.

Astral lunged forward, but the daemon moved with slick inhuman speed and was behind him trying to swipe at him with deadly claws. Astral’s wings moved instinctively to block the blow and batted the hand away. The two began to circle each other.

“A halfie that can fight.” The daemon laughed, “Finally, something worth my attention.” 

“Where’s your knight?” Astral growled.

“Casterum?” The daemon shrugged. “No clue, he called me up a few days ago. Said a Fallen had kicked his ass to protect a halfie and some lazarus’d little twerp.” 

“You keep her out of this.” Astral hissed, as he felt his temper spike. He had to take a moment to reign it in and the daemon lunged at that moment. The daemon managed to get him against a wall and dug his claws into his coat. 

“What is this?” The daemon roared, “Is this dragon leather?” 

Astral grinned and freed a hand that he drove straight into the daemon’s face. He followed it up with a powerful downward strike to the creature’s knee. The daemon bellowed a roar and lunged forward, Astral moved with grace and stepped aside with some time to spare, then he grabbed the daemon around the neck and held tight, he wasn’t sure the Words would work on a manifested daemon at full strength, but he knew he needed to try. 

He shouted the binding word and threw the daemon down. The creature rolled and tried to stand, but golden strands of light held him in a bowed and crawling position. Astral ran forward and soccer kicked the daemon’s head. The daemon flipped twice in the air before landing on its back and roaring in anger. It stood once again and glared at Astral. 

Then an explosion rocked the building outside. Nothing powerful, but it was distracting as five colorful blasts of smoke and fire filled the air. Astral realized he was about to get a stupidly quick introduction to local heroes, then looked back at the daemon whose face was twisting into a normal human face.

“Oh, you little bitch.” Astral rushed forward before the daemon could speak. “I’m not about to let you do that!” He slammed the daemon down and then issued another binding command to the daemon’s mouth. 

He collapsed his wings down so the daemon couldn’t grab them and suddenly realized why Lucifer had been trying to teach him to channel the powers without his wings. That was next on his list it seemed.

The daemon struggled to peel the words of light that sealed its mouth shut, but every time it touched the words its hands burned and became less and less human. 

“Never fear, the Sentai Saviors are here!” A red armor clad man shouted as he and a group of similarly dressed heroes rushed into the building.

“This is a daemon manifested, unless you can actually handle a powerful spiritual evil; GET OUT!” Astral bellowed.

“Hey, you can’t tell us what to do!” A woman in green snapped.

“I really don’t need this.” Astral sighed as he struggled to hold the daemon down. “I can handle this, but I need you out of here!” 

“If you’re a hero, you’ll let us help!” A blue armored man said.

Astral stood up and spread his wings again, letting the light that came from them make it clear that he was not here to negotiate. 

The five heroes hesitated for a moment as Astral finally lost the ability to hold the daemon down. The daemon rolled out from the pin and ripped its own lips off, revealing its inhuman form. It hissed and growled and rushed towards the group of heroes, but stopped short as it looked down to see golden fire decorating the fist that he penetrated its chest. It stumbled forward and laughed before spinning around and leaping onto Astral’s wing and biting deep into. Then it exploded and Astral found himself outside the building looking up at the sky.

“Ow.” Was all he could muster before he felt small arms grab his chest.

He slowly pushed himself up and saw that people were looking at him. Ariane was latched onto him as a fog filled the area.

“How bad is it, doctor?” Astral cracked as he looked at his wing, the venom of the daemon had been burnt off by the light that emanated from his wings, but the wound was still there. He also noticed that even though his coat was fine, half his shirt was gone and his shoes were no longer on his feet.

“You said you weren’t going anywhere!” Ariane sobbed. 

“Am I still here?” Astral walked over to the building and looked in.

Ariane nodded and sobbed, “But I was afraid.” 

“Well, that’s normal.” He sat Ariane down and pointed to the five heroes on the ground who were holding wounds through damaged suits. “I think they need some help though.” 

Ariane sniffled and focused, the fog began to fill the area.  

Astral looked around and saw that the daemon had destroyed the entire lobby of the building. Then he watched Emmi and Ukiko come out of an office from the back. 

“I won.” Astral smiled, “Or he lost.” 

“Is that normal for you?” Emmi asked.

Astral nodded. 

Emmi tore a piece of paper in half.

“Was that a lease contract?” Astral asked.

Emmi nodded emphatically.

“Right.” Astral nodded. “Rude neighbors it is.” 

Ukiko pushed past Emmi and looked Astral over, hesitantly reaching out to make sure he was okay.

“I’m mostly fine.” Astral nodded, “Ariane made sure the big wounds sealed fast.” He leaned a bit to see the Sentai Saviors, “Those guys could use an ambulance.” 

“They’ll be fine!” Ariane smiled, “They’re heroes!” 

“My leg is going the wrong way!.” The woman in green shouted.

“I’ll call.” Emmi sighed, “I just repaired this lobby.” 

“Are you really okay?” Ukiko asked, “That was terrifying.” 

“I am.” Astral nodded, “How so?” 

“He didn’t look human. Like someone who had a human described to them made a life sized clay model.” 

Astral nodded, “Well you can see past their disguises, so that’s good.” 

“What, why? How?” Ukiko asked.

“Some people can. Sometimes it's stubbornness, sometimes it's just a gift.” Astral shrugged. “For now, I’m going to sit and wait for the cops. Then I want to go home and put the bed together.” He saw down and leaned against a warped metal beam.

“What about a mattress?” Ukiko asked.

“Came with it.” Astral sighed, “I hope.”

“If not, you have a couch.” Ukiko sat next to him as Ariane came over and sat in her lap.

Astral laughed, “I bet this is what your dad had info on. I was being hunted.” 

“Was that a normal one?” Ukiko asked.

Astral shook his head, “Hollowed out the host, took over. We call it incarnating or manifesting. They eat the soul, put themselves in the body and can do horrible things with it. No way to save the person.” 

Ukiko nodded, “That can happen to anyone?” 

“No.” Astral sighed, “Manifesting requires torturing the host to wanting to die. Then a ritual. The more powerful the daemon the more time needed and the more power nee-” He paused and connected some information. “They’re manifesting a lord.” 

“What?’ Ukiko asked.

“The knight said he was going to bring his boss to Earth, but they all say that. The artifacts we purified were basically souls trapped in coins.” Astral said, “Normally you need time and torture to weaken a soul. Or they could boost their boss's power with favors from other daemon lords.” 

“Okay.” Ukiko nodded, “I’m following.”

“Your dad had a chest full of coins, like I said. I had been wondering what their purposes would be because there were too many for even a knight to use safely. But a lord, trying to manifest...” He nodded and went silent as he recalled the night he met Lucifer and the school ID that the daemon’s had dropped. Slowly pieces came together and a creeping horror grew like a pit in his soul.

“Aster...” Ariane tapped his shoulder. “What’s wrong?’ 

“Bad men are doing bad things.” Astral stood up. “I need to find our Doctor friend.” 

Ukiko stood up and pulled out a business card from her purse and handed it to Astral. Astral took it and dialed the number.

“Hello.” Lucifer’s voice answered, “What lesson have you mastered?” 

“They’re planning to manifest their boss by boosting his power. Who does Casterum work for?” Astral asked in his most serious tone.

“Casterum? He is a knight of arrogance and ambition.” Lucifer said, “I believe he serves Mammon.” 

Astral felt like the world had suddenly shrunk to a pinpoint as he realized what was happening. 

“What are the signs of Mammon’s presence?” Astral asked, trying to remember himself, he had blocked off those memories so filled with pain. The halls and the buildings the daemon prince had possessed six months prior. 

“Rotting flesh, selfishness, greed.” Lucifer counted off many more but Astral had stopped listening as several officers approached. He found himself shouting for them to get to the junior high that he had written down earlier, then he shouted into the phone for Lucifer to meet him there.

“Astral!” Ukiko shook him back to his senses. “What’s going on?” 

Astral took Ariane from Ukiko’s arms for a moment and then handed her back after a hug. Then he took a deep breath and spoke with the confidence of a man about to march off to a war he wasn’t sure he could win. 

“They're going to be acting soon, that school has all the signs of being under Mammon’s thrall. Lucifer and I are going to have to try and stop it at the center before it starts getting too big to stop.” Astral pulled Ukiko in for a hug. “I need you to go with the oni, they’re gonna take you somewhere safe.” 

“Aster?” Araine reached out for him. “You’ll come back, right?” 

“If I can.” Astral nodded, “And believe me I’m going to fight for that.” 

He dialed a number on his phone and called Akira. “I already know what’s going on, do me a favor, come pick up Ukiko and Ariane. Take them to Mama Yaga.” 

“Consider it done.” Akira said, “Address.” 

Astral gave it and ended the call, then he was in the air flying straight for the school. In the distance he saw a pillar of red light extend from the school grounds. The daemons were starting, and he hoped they still had time.

1iv0o3x,https://www.reddit.com/r/POS/comments/1iv0o3x/question_regarding_aronium_pos_feature/,Question regarding Aronium POS feature,"**Greetings folks!**  
I have a question about the free tier of Aronium POS. My family runs a single-location coffee shop, and we’re looking to deploy a new POS soon. We don’t need anything overly fancy—just something the staff can pick up easily. Because it’s similar to our previous system, we decided to test Aronium, and so far, it’s been great **except** for one thing: **there doesn’t seem to be a way to split a bill by item**.

Here’s the scenario: two customers sit at table A and order. When they’re ready to pay, they each want to pay only for their items. Aronium currently has all items at table A, and there’s no straightforward way to split them (unless you order in ""rounds"" as I've read on a dated community post, but that does not make the situation easier at all). The only workaround I’ve found is to move certain items to another empty table, then bill that table, and repeat. It **works**, but it’s clunky and gets frustrating when you do it multiple times a day.

So I’m wondering if there’s a simpler solution to splitting bills by item in Aronium that I might be missing. If not, can anyone recommend a POS that’s similar to Aronium but supports this feature more gracefully?

Thanks in advance, and stay safe out there!",2,1740169382.0,POS,2,1.0,False

I have to limit coffee… it can also make me bleed more heavily on my periods too if I drink too much.

1iv0khq,https://www.reddit.com/r/survivinginfidelity/comments/1iv0khq/bear_with_me_as_this_is_a_long_one/,"Bear with me, as this is a long one…","My wife (F43) and I (M39) met while we were both students in her home country. I caught glimpses of her in the hallways of the university. I remember being drawn to her when we were both outside having a smoke.

One night, I was out drinking at a bar. She popped in near closing time, wearing a short dress. I mustered the courage to strike up a conversation. She was hopelessly hammered yet she telegraphed a glimmer of recognition. She'd also noticed me at the library, she said, after I broke the ice. We went out for a smoke on a public bench and she broke down in tears, launching into a convulsive litany of self-hating recriminations. I did my best to console her and we went back to my place, where we lay hugging in bed. I felt her vulnerability, which quickened my protective instincts. The following morning, we grabbed coffee and agreed we'd meet up again after an imminent trip I had planned to another country.

We kept our promise. She started spending increasingly more time at my apartment, usually in the wee small hours, in varyingly lucid states. I once again understood I would need to take care of her, especially after two good Samaritans found her passed out in a nearby alley, dressed in nothing but lingerie. She fessed up soon after: in addition to her studies, she was leading a double life as a sex worker. I told her that if our relationship was to have a future, she would have to quit and find another job because it was destroying her. Likewise the hard drugs. The drinking would have to be at the very least toned down – I wasn't exactly a role model on that front either.

There was tremendous chemistry between us, in every sense. Our temperaments were similar, and we had much to learn from each other, not least culturally. We both had a history of depression, though her trauma ran deeper than mine. She had been raped as a teenager. Her (separated) parents were useless, each in their own way. I was a young man at the time but I took it upon myself to save her and, perhaps, to save myself in the process.

It was a major challenge, and I was attracted to challenges. Then things began to look up: she traded sex work for a job that didn't have as toxic an effect on her. She quit cocaine. She made headway in her studies, which had been stalling, and ultimately finished her master's degree. She still had issues with alcohol – blackouts, breakdowns, clashes – but less often. In the grand scheme of things, it felt like a step up. So much so that by the time her situation started to resemble normalcy, she suggested that we get married. I said yes.

We moved to my home country, as more professional opportunities awaited us there and a clean break seemed like the best way for her to consolidate her healing process. It felt like adulthood proper. There were fits and starts but the overall trajectory still seemed promising.

Then the stagnation began. While I was coming to terms with obstacles and making my way up professionally, financially, and emotionally, she suffered a few setbacks, which sent her reeling. Her resilience was failing, and I could only supply so much of it myself. She worked very little, if at all. Her drinking habit further devolved, and while sleepwalking in a haze of alcohol she would often hit on random men or, at parties, on male friends. Our sex life was on the wane too, though this hardly came as a surprise seeing as we had already been together for many years by that point.

After the worst of the pandemic was over, she started a new job. Her colleagues turned out to be party animals, for the most part. She distanced herself from me and got closer to these novel and more exciting friends. She would come home late at night again, utterly smashed. Sometimes she would not come home until the next morning. She spoke of opening up our relationship. Too often for comfort, she would call in sick at work. I explained to her that our marriage wouldn't survive if she didn't get serious help, though I had no idea what that could mean since she was already in therapy and taking antidepressants. I said it might be time to quit drinking for good. She refused, feeling herself incapable of going that far.

I became less generous, less accepting. I would stop censoring myself when describing what I made of her behaviour. Self-destruction. Destruction brought upon those closest to her. Having grown into an adult in no small part by taking care of her, I became more and more of a stern father figure while she was ever the wayward teenage girl. A toxic dynamic if ever there was one. She started spending increasingly more time on social media, chatting with old acquaintances from her home country, many of whom were also struggling with substance abuse.

Last summer, she was back in her home country, visiting family. I noticed that something was off, and she confessed that she wasn't quite where she said she was. She was visiting friends, she said, and didn't want to tell me because she knew I'd be worried sick. I had travel plans there as well, and we were scheduled to meet up afterwards. I pondered whether I should cancel my trip or not. I decided to go ahead with it anyway, just to see what happens. Though it seemed highly probable, I didn't want to believe that she might have cheated on me and even reasoned that a drunken one-night stand wouldn't be the end of the world, even though I did not buy it myself.

Upon returning home, we decided to give it another go. She went back to work and, for the first month or so, it seemed to be going well. Then, for the second time in two years, she found herself on sick leave, which she kept renewing. She would spend hours upon hours in bed. Sleeping pills would do her in for 13-14 hours at a time. She would drink when I was at work and lie to me about it. She took so many prescription drugs it made her speech slurred even when I knew for a fact she was wasn't drinking that day. She was hopeless and miserable. She started taking harder drugs behind my back. My supposed paranoia, as she was quick to call it, was anything but.

A couple of weeks ago, she told me she was unhappy and considering temporarily relocating to her home country. A mere one-year break in our relationship, she said. She needed to find herself because she felt like she had never managed to build an identity within our marriage, as I was always calling the shots. I told her that I strongly suspected there was more to it.

(In addition to what happened last summer, on New Year's Eve, she went to bed after me so she could continue drinking. Around 5:30 AM, I woke up and went downstairs to tell her it was time to get some rest. I could her a male voice in the background. She was on a call with a guy from her home country. The next day, she claimed it was a party that had lingered and she was chatting with not one but several friends.)

A few days after she told me she was planning on moving back abroad, I pressed her for more details. I told her I believed she was having a long-distance affair. That she'd slept with him last summer. That she'd kept in touch with him even after she confessed to lying about that leg of the trip and swearing she still loved me. That she had entangled herself in so many lies that they had become inextricable and that there was no going back from this since I could never trust her again. She confessed.

She bought a plane ticket that very evening. She said she'd be back in a month, giving me enough time to move into a new place.

I wish she had had the maturity to tell me she was done with the relationship before inflicting additional harm on me. I wish she hadn't lied about this and so many other things. I wish she hadn't betrayed the very person who did the most to support and protect her, who loved her the most. I wish she wasn't so thoroughly broken as to feel incapable of existing without wreaking havoc upon her own life and that of others.

I have many wishes. But now, most of all, I wish to be released from this love and to learn how to be at peace with myself. Towards the end of our relationship, when its doom was imminent, I partly used it as a way of shielding my own mind from the fear that it was all for naught and that I would end up alone forever more because of how difficult it is to meet someone with whom you have a strong connection, no matter how toxic. I wish to be alone and to figure out how to love being alone before meeting someone who is able to reciprocate the love I have to give.

At home I’ll make an espresso style coffee that constitutes about 60% of my drink and then hot semi-sweetened soy milk will constitute the rest. 

When I ask for a latte at Starbucks, even if I ask for an extra shot, the drink always ends up too milky. Can someone provide guidance on what I should ask for? Thanks!",1,1740168974.0,starbucks,12,1.0,False

1iv0i92,https://www.reddit.com/r/tipping/comments/1iv0i92/shift_from_earned_to_entitlement/,Shift from earned to entitlement,"I have worked in various jobs during college- no long ago- 

Increasingly, practice has morphed ..from being earned/optional to a must obligation for patrons “from having it earned to entitlement” 

This psychological shift brings unsavory dynamics into play—tip shaming or expecting gratuities when customers do most of the work themselves at self-serve tablets and for something obvious for the price already paid

Appreciation comes in various forms, including sincere compliments..

A family struggling financially yet enjoying a rare outing shouldn’t bear the burden of giving a large percentage on their total bill or get shamed .​​​​​​​​

The beauty in all of this is It’s gradual training in shifting behavior- what didn’t happen is now common , we gradually adapt things first reluctantly but it eventually becomes a norm - pay tip when ordering your coffee in kiosk? Sure…

I’d say focus on key fundamental, what is Tip! And act from there - answer for most is certain service rendered that earned a tip then proudly act from there. Then whatever you choose or get feel shamed” smile and move on

1iv0h9n,https://www.reddit.com/r/Testosterone/comments/1iv0h9n/low_t_symptoms_or_other_causes_help_appreciated/,Low T symptoms or other causes? Help appreciated.,"Hi folks,

Let's start with a sketch:

**Age**: 33  
**Weight:** 230lbs / 105kgs  
**Composition:** \~18% bodyfat  
**Height:** 6ft5  
**Activity level:** 6-8 hours of heavy resistance training per week  
**Sleep:** around between 6.5 and 7.5 hours of actual sleep time on average  
**Diet:** i'd say average to good:  
\- Low refined sugar (not a sweet tooth)  
\- Lots of protein (\~200+ grams). I eat red meat, chicken and eggs daily  
\- Enough greens, carb source mostly (sweet) potato, rice and sometimes oats  
**Supplementation:** creatine, Zinc, D, Magnesium, Multivitamin, inconsistent on omega-3  
**Smoke:** No (although i do consume some nicotine through nic pouches)  
**Caffeine:** yes, 2-3 cups of coffee a day, no pre-workout or energy drink  
**Drink:** exclusively socially, i'll have a beer once every 2 weeks or so

For the past couple of years (sometimes worse than others, currently pretty bad) i've experienced symptoms that are consistent with low T (Hardly any libido, hard to arrouse, morning wood maybe once or twice a week, intermittent ED, relative low energy; tired quick and even if i sleep well hard to focus / concentrate > feeling foggy / groggy).

Went to GP and asked for bloods. Blood drawn within an hour of me waking up. Only got back Total test (which was about 400ng/dl) and TSH levels (1.6mU/l). This test was at the end of 2023 (at age 32), and symptoms seem to have gotten worse since then. I currently have an appointment with the doctor coming monday where i will demand a full panel (free test, SHBG, prolactin, estrogen) as this is seriously starting to affect my QOL. I have a happy relationship with my girlfriend of two years but the frequency of our intimacy has taken a serious hit and it's definetely not because of her.

I understand that saying anything without knowing my free T, SHBG, E2, DHT, prolactin, LH, FSH, T3, T4 and cortisol is really hard to impossible, but do these things sound like this could be a potential cause for my symptoms? Are there any things i can do, take or try to boost my testosterone outside of potentially TRT (if my hormone shit comes back fucked) and fix these issues? This is really stressing me out and affecting me mentally, and making me worried about my relationship (i have a very supportive girlfriend, but still).

Any thoughts on the matter are appreciated!",1,1740168894.0,Testosterone,1,1.0,False

I'm often finding myself just randomly jumping around different flavors but I'm not really sure what I like in general. I was curious if anyone had attended a fun coffee tasting class or something like that ? We rarely get a night out without the kids, but I think one might be coming up soon and it would make a perfect date night!
