WASHINGTON: The US will seek agreements with eight allied nations as part of a fresh effort to strengthen supply chains for the computer chips and critical minerals needed for AI technology, according to the top state department official for economic affairs.

The initiative, which builds on efforts dating back to the first Trump administration, unfolds as the US looks to cut dependence on China.

It will begin with a meeting at the White House on Dec 12 between the US and counterparts from Japan, South Korea, Singapore, the Netherlands, the UK, Israel, the UAE and Australia, Jacob Helberg, the undersecretary of state for economic affairs, said in an interview.

Helberg, a former adviser at Palantir Technologies Inc said the summit will focus on reaching agreements across the areas of energy, critical minerals, advanced manufacturing semiconductors, AI infrastructure, and transportation logistics.

Helberg said the countries were chosen for reasons that range from being home to some of the most important semiconductor companies to their critical minerals resources.

“It’s clear that right now in AI, it’s a two-horse race – it’s the US and China,” Helberg said.

“We want to have a positive, stable relationship with China, but we’re also ready to compete, and we want to make sure that our companies can continue building transformative technologies without being subject to coercive dependencies,” Helberg said.

Helberg’s initiative builds upon years of efforts on critical minerals supply chains by prior administrations largely aimed at helping reduce western dependence on China.

The state department in the first Trump administration launched the US energy resource governance initiative with the aim of securing supply chains for critical minerals like lithium and cobalt.

The Biden administration launched a minerals security partnership that aimed to funnel foreign investment and western expertise to the mining sectors of developing nations.

Even so, the US and other countries have been unable to break China’s stranglehold over rare earths supplies.

China is home to more than 90% of global rare earths and permanent magnets refining capacity, compared with just 4% for second-place Malaysia, according to the International Energy Agency, a Paris-based intergovernmental organization.

China announced tighter rare earths export controls in early October, only to agree to a one-year suspension after a meeting between Trump and President Xi Jinping.

Helberg said that unlike the Biden-era initiative, which had more than a dozen core countries, his focus is on producer countries.

“While the first Trump administration initiative focused on critical minerals, it came before the public release of AI platforms like ChatGPT, and the new plan focuses across all layers of the technology involved in AI, not just one,” Helberg said.

Helberg, 36, was previously senior adviser to Palantir CEO Alex Karp and also co-founded the Hill and Valley Forum, a gathering of tech leaders and US lawmakers focused on national security challenges, especially those related to competition with China and the advancement of AI and other technologies.

In a cable on Tuesday to state department employees seen by Bloomberg News, Helberg said that “after decades of failed globalisation that neither supported domestic industry nor preserved critical supply chains, the US must leverage our immense wealth and technological edge to secure our leadership” and bring benefits for the American people.

“Besides securing technology supply chains, his office’s priorities include promoting trade and US exports, particularly LNG and nuclear energy, to create jobs,” Helberg said in the cable.

It’s also working to rebuild the US industrial economy via construction of new factories and manufacturing, and to use economic tools to help stabilise conflict zones and end wars.

Trump’s focus on ending wars can lower volatility in global commodity markets and remove a de facto tax cut for American consumers, Helberg said in the cable.

In the interview, he framed the work with trusted allies for his AI initiative as an “America centric” strategy, rather than one that’s reactive to China.

“Countries who are participating understand the transformative impact of AI, both for the size of a country’s economy, as well as the strengths of a country’s military,” he said.

“They want to be a part of the AI boom,” he added.

The US is reportedly planning to seek agreements with eight allied countries to enhance the critical minerals supply chain and secure key resources for AI technology.

This initiative is intended to decrease reliance on China, reported *Bloomberg*, citing a leading official for economic affairs at the State Department*.*

Jacob Helberg, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, said in an interview that the efforts will commence with a White House meeting in December.

Delegates from Australia, South Korea, Israel, Japan, the Netherlands, Singapore, the UK and the United Arab Emirates are scheduled to meet on 12 December.

Helberg, formerly an adviser at Palantir Technologies, said the gathering will concentrate on establishing cooperation in advanced manufacturing, AI infrastructure, critical minerals, energy, logistics and semiconductors.

He explained that the selection of these nations was based on their roles in semiconductor manufacturing and their reserves of critical minerals.

Helberg said: “It is clear that right now in AI, it is a two-horse race – it is the US and China. We want to have a positive, stable relationship with China, but we are also ready to compete, and we want to make sure that our companies can continue building transformative technologies without being subject to coercive dependencies.”

During the first Trump administration, the State Department introduced the US Energy Resource Governance Initiative to help secure supply chains for critical minerals such as cobalt and lithium.

Under the Biden administration, a Minerals Security Partnership was established to attract foreign investment and bring Western expertise to mining industries in developing countries.

Despite these initiatives, China remains the dominant force in the rare earths market, *Bloomberg* reported.

In August, *Reuters* reported that the US Government had [announced plans to implement](https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/news/trump-set-floor-price-rare-earths-boost-us-production/) price support measures for domestic rare earth projects to strengthen local production and reduce China’s market dominance.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) reports that China refines more than 90% of global rare earths and permanent magnets.

In October, China introduced stricter export controls on rare earths but subsequently agreed to a one-year suspension after discussions between US President Donald Trump and China’s President Xi Jinping.

As competition between the US and China over critical minerals intensifies, a report from AidData, a research laboratory at William & Mary University in the US, stated that the US is the [largest individual recipient](https://www.investmentmonitor.ai/news/china-loans-us/) of Chinese official credit.

The US has received more than $200bn (1.41tn yuan) through nearly 2,500 projects and initiatives across almost every state between 2000 and 2023.

These investments encompass a wide range of sectors including pipelines, logistics infrastructure, data centres and corporate credit facilities.

China’s global lending and grant activities reached $2.2tn across 200 countries between 2000 and 2023.

The report found that China’s overseas lending mainly targets upper-middle and high-income economies including the EU, with an emphasis on sensitive industries.

[Waiting for MORE CORE = MORE ORE & material news as is becomes available with many on a host of catalyts!](https://reddit.com/link/1pdypqd/video/oawmdwr6h65g1/player)

**NioCorp is entering one of the most catalyst-heavy windows in its history, yet the market is still valuing it like a stalled small-cap miner stuck at $6. That’s the disconnect —** because Elk Creek is increasingly positioned to trade like a U.S. advanced-materials industrial, not a traditional mining company. By 2029, Niocorp will be supplying **Seven** Tier-1 critical minerals across **five major industrial and defense sectors**: ferroniobium for aerospace/EV structural steels, Scandium and Sc-Al master alloys for DoD lightweighting, Titanium & TiCl₄ for aircraft and industrial chemicals, and magnet REEs (Nd-Pr-Dy-Tb) for defense, EV motors, and electrification. **This is a multi-stream, multi-market revenue engine — not a one-metal story — and it aligns perfectly with DFARS, NDAA, and U.S. sovereign supply-chain mandates.**

https://reddit.com/link/1pdypqd/video/pnixxtjgj65g1/player

Layer in the emerging ScAl alloy program with Lockheed/IBC/DoD — with a February 2026 reveal expected — and the picture becomes even clearer. Scandium oxide is useless without downstream alloy manufacturing capacity, and NioCorp + IBC is effectively building a U.S. supply hub just as Lockheed Martin ramps hypersonics and next-gen platforms. ***No other U.S. project can deliver Ferroniobium, Scandium, TiCl₄/Titanium, and magnet REEs from one vertically integrated site. That means Elk Creek behaves more like a strategic industrial platform than a mine, and valuations eventually adjust toward industrial EV/EBITDA multiples — similar to MP Materials but with two to three times the commodity breadth!!!***

And right now, we’re in the pre-revaluation quiet zone. Dec. 5’s open house (with the governor & senator), the Dec. 10 RedChip event, and the mid-December completion of remaining drill assays (holes #3–#13) all hit within days of each other. These assays determine whether Elk Creek confirms its march toward **1 million tonnes TREO**, which transforms both the DFS economics and Niocorp’s negotiating power with EXIM, DoD, automakers, and defense primes. Add in the meeting with EXIM last week, utilities/road work alignment, and the addition of the poison pill, and it’s obvious the company is preparing for financing, not floundering.

From late January/early February 2026 (potential DFS expected release) to the Feb. -ScAl alloy announcement, followed by offtakes, the ESIA filing, and then FID/groundbreaking targeted for June - Sept. 2026, the entire path is now lined with unavoidable catalysts. Once offtakes begin locking — especially scandium and magnet REEs — Niocorp’s revenue mix shifts from cyclical mining to contracted U.S. industrial supply. That’s when the re-rating occurs. Not at first production — but when the market finally realizes Elk Creek is a sovereign-grade, multi-commodity critical-mineral backbone asset that feeds half a dozen national-security pipelines.

**The coiled spring is here. When even a few of these catalysts drop — assays, infrastructure, alloy news, or funding — $6 becomes a memory very quickly!**

I’m an expat from South Africa \[M30\], working as an engineer in a lab here in Apeldoorn. I love my job, but I’ve been finding it tough to build a good social circle outside of work.

I enjoy a good mix. I’m happy chilling in a quiet café for a coffee, or getting energized over a game or activity. I’m generally laid-back and value genuine connections. My Dutch is not great (yet!), so I'm primarily looking for people who can communicate in English, though if you're also willing to occasionally speak Dutch with me, that would be awesome!

 My Interests

1. Tabletop/Gaming: I'm into Board Games (I'm open to almost anything!) and I’m IN LOVE with Warhammer 40K I paint and play.
2. Motorcycles: I’m currently working on getting my license and talking about bikes.
3. Video Games: Always happy to chat about or play new releases. Currently playing BF6. But have a diverse library (PC gamer)

Honestly, my biggest challenge is overcoming a bit of social anxiety and the fear of approaching people. I want to work on my conversational skills and just get better at meeting new friends!

I'd love to find people for casual meetups for coffee or a drink. Just talking and hanging out, and eventually exploring Gelderland or beyond. While I live in Apeldoorn, I’m totally happy traveling to meet up in surrounding cities or regions!

Drop me a message if any of that resonates with you tell me your favorite board game or what brought you to the Netherlands!

Here is how","I see a lot of “how do I start?”, “how do I do this?”, “how do I even pick a stock?” type posts here, so I figured I’d share the approach that made things finally click for me.

**A stock is just a tiny piece of a real business**. That’s it. If you were buying a neighborhood coffee shop, you’d want to know if it makes money, if customers come back, if costs are reasonable, and if the owner knows what they’re doing. Public companies work the same way, just bigger.

**Prices jump around constantly**, but it doesn’t mean the business changed overnight. Sometimes stocks go up or down because of earnings or news, but sometimes it’s literally just people getting excited or scared. Long term, prices tend to follow how the actual business performs. Short term, it’s mostly noise.

**Get honest about why you invest**. Is it for retirement? For fun? For something in a few years? Your time horizon basically tells you how much risk you can handle. If you need the money soon, you probably don’t want wild swings. If you’ve got decades, they don’t matter as much.

The other big thing is knowing yourself. Some people can watch their portfolio drop 20% and feel nothing. Others lose sleep over it. There’s no right or wrong, but it affects what you should buy. For me, **starting with simple, broad ETFs** made it way easier to stay sane. Once I felt comfortable, I slowly added a couple individual stocks I actually understood, instead of chasing whatever was trending.

On the “**how do you pick a stock?**” question: you really don’t need to know everything. I started with the absolute basics: does the company make money, does it grow, does it have cash left over after expenses, and am I paying a reasonable price for what I’m getting? You can get most of that from any basic financial website or the company’s own filings. You don’t need to be a pro to understand the general picture.

**Choosing a brokerage** was a lot less dramatic than I expected. I just picked one that was well-known, low fee, and easy to use. You don’t need 10 different apps. One good broker is enough. (I use IBKR).

The biggest thing that helped me was **consistency**. I stopped trying to guess the “right time” and just added money on a schedule. You end up caring less about daily price swings and more about long-term progress. It makes everything calmer.

And honestly, learning is the part that compounds. The more companies you look at, the better your instincts get.

If you’re just starting out, don’t feel like you need to be an expert on day one. Most people overthink it. **Keep it simple**, stay patient, and try to focus more on understanding the business than guessing charts.",1,1764850829.0,investingforbeginners,2,1.0,False

I haven't been given amnestics yet 🤞).

I was a Safe class research assistant, first year, zero experience, minimum card rank, and my job was basically:
“Take these papers and don't break anything.”

Well, it turns out that the director of the facility (DEP) recently died, they cremated him and everything. So far nothing strange.

But one day I'm walking down a hallway that almost no one uses and I see a black card lying behind a flower pot.
I thought: “ah, a lost card from the laboratory, it must be level 2 or 3”.

NO.
It was a damn High Tier card. Category “why is a simple wizard touching this?”

But since I am a genius of the 21st century I thought:
“Well, I'll try it and see if it pulls.”

And he pulled.
He didn't just pull: he directly opened the Keter section for me.

⸻

So far so bad. But wait.

I am entering a forbidden hallway as if nothing had happened, when suddenly I run into the director of scientists, the most serious guy on the Site. The man looks at me, looks at my Safe class robe, looks at the Keter gate and his brain short-circuits.

Literal question:

“HOW THE HELL DO YOU GET ACCESS HERE?”

I just held up the card like it was my school ID and said:
“I found it behind a flower pot.”

I think for a second he thought I was lying, or that I was a spy, or that I was going to blow something up. But no... he just scolded me, told me to get out, and that's it.

But he didn't call security.
He didn't ask for paperwork.
He didn't report anything.
He didn't take my card.

So... I kept going.
What was I going to do? Not even an alarm sounded!

⸻

And yes... I took advantage of it 😅

Every work break I went to see experiments with the director of scientists.
He opened cameras, cut recordings, checked containment.

I didn't hurt anyone or anything, but I admit it was fun.
He was literally a Safe class assistant playing Keter investigator.

And no one said anything for a whole month.

⸻

Why did they take it away from me?

The official reason:

“Because you're already driving me crazy, kid.”

The real reason:

The director of scientists got tired of seeing me in places where I should NOT be.
So he grabbed the card…and burned it. Literal. 🔥

No paperwork.
No incident report.
No protocol.

I chose an IKEA Lohals jute rug. It was marketed as a good rug for a kitchen-diner. In the photos, there's a small child crawling on it. Perfect.

Two months later, we've had to chuck it. We can't even give it away, it's so filthy. One of my kids dropped a cupcake and got organge buttercream all over it. The other kid spilled a full glass of smoothie on it. And that's in addition to the everyday bits of food that are now embedded in the fibers. I've tried vacuuming it with a non-spinning brush. I've tried spot-cleaning, as per the instructions. It's impossible to keep it clean. I don't even know how families without small kids do it. Have they never knocked over a cup of coffee or glass of red wine? How do you clean that out of jute?!

Anyway, so that's £150 that I'm not getting back. And we now need to buy another rug.

I've looked at Ruggable. We actually have one of their rugs in another room, but they're quite expensive in the larger sizes. How many times can you run it through the washing machine before it starts to look like a dirty rag that cost £400?

I've looked at some cheaper 'machine washable' rugs (e.g. Livabliss), but the reviews suggest that they don't stand up to even a single wash.

Is there such a thing as a truly washable rug? One that can be washed a couple times a month and vacuumed in between, and still look good?

1pdyffl,https://www.reddit.com/r/sugarfree/comments/1pdyffl/sugar_is_the_modern_worlds_silent_killer_and/,Sugar is the modern world's silent killer and nobody wants to admit it,"We treat sugar like it's harmless. ""Just a little treat."" ""Everything in moderation."" Meanwhile, it's quietly destroying people's health in ways they won't notice for years.

Here's what nobody tells you: sugar isn't just making you fat. It's literally addictive, causes inflammation throughout your body, crashes your energy, destroys your focus, and sets you up for diabetes, heart disease, and a dozen other conditions.

**It's hidden everywhere.** Bread, sauce, ""healthy"" yogurt, salad dressing, protein bars. You think you're eating clean but consuming 50+ grams of added sugar daily without realizing it.

Your body wasn't designed for this. Our ancestors ate maybe 20 pounds of sugar per year. Average American? 150+ pounds. We're running 21st century lives on stone age biology that's completely overwhelmed.

**What actually happens:**

Blood sugar spikes → insulin floods your system → energy crashes → cravings hit → you reach for more sugar. Repeat this 5 times a day and you've trained your body to be dependent on constant sugar hits just to feel normal.

Your brain on sugar looks similar to your brain on cocaine in brain scans. That's not metaphor. That's actual neuroscience. You're not weak for craving it - you're literally experiencing chemical dependency.

**The signs you're eating too much:**

* Energy crashes every afternoon
* Can't think clearly without coffee or snacks
* Mood swings throughout the day
* Always hungry even after eating
* Can't go a few hours without eating something
* Brain fog that clears temporarily after eating
* Skin issues, inflammation, constant bloating

**What changed when I cut it:**

First week was hell. Genuine withdrawal - headaches, irritability, cravings. But after 10 days, something flipped. Energy became stable all day. Brain fog disappeared. Lost weight without trying. Sleep improved. Skin cleared up.

Most shocking: food started tasting different. Carrots tasted sweet. I could taste subtle flavors I'd been missing. Realized my taste buds had been so overloaded with sugar they'd become desensitized to everything else.

**How to actually cut it:**

Read labels. If sugar/glucose/fructose/syrup is in the first 5 ingredients, don't buy it. You'll be shocked how much you have to eliminate.

Quit gradually or cold turkey - both work, depends on your personality. I went cold turkey for 30 days to reset completely.

Replace with whole foods. Fruit is fine - the fiber slows absorption. It's the added/processed sugar that destroys you.

Expect withdrawal. Plan for it. Week one will suck. Push through. Week two gets easier. By week three, you won't even want it anymore.

Don't replace with artificial sweeteners. They keep your brain trained to expect sweet flavors and often have their own problems.

The food industry profits from your addiction. They literally engineer products to be as addictive as possible. That's not conspiracy  that's documented fact. They don't want you to quit.

Sugar is socially acceptable poison. We give it to kids, we celebrate with it, we use it to cope with stress. Meanwhile it's slowly destroying metabolic health across entire populations.

You can ignore this. Most people will. Keep eating the standard Western diet and join the 88% of Americans with metabolic dysfunction. Or you can treat sugar like what it actually is an addictive substance that should be consumed rarely, not daily.",2,1764850273.0,sugarfree,1,0.67,False

I imagine us saving up money to get some land and building a tiny home together. Eventually, us building our dream home on the property. I imagine us going on plenty of car rides together enjoying the backroads, music, and the roar of a flatplane crank engine. I imagine me giving you daily massages that never end and I am so excited about that lol. The life you described is so beautiful and I want it so bad.

I would love for me to be mowing the grass and next thing ya know I see the sexiest girl alive naked in our window/doorway. I would love for us to talk all the time because we truly are best friends. I know we will make great parents too when the time is right and I am glad you will be the one to mother our kids. I can see you excelling in your career once your degree is complete, or being a stay at home mom. All I want to do is love and support you in what you decide.

Primarily, it's a keyword search page that saves me from keeping a ton of bookmarks, and from having to type keywords repeatedly. I'm quickly outgrowing this simple setup, although it does work well overall. Needing mobile access is one of numerous reasons.

  
The keyword list needs the option to be sorted by alphabet, date, and random. Need a keyword count. Would like number of clicks per each keyword. Need brief notes for each keyword, and perhaps tags. Need some keywords to expire after a certain date.

  
The page has some external links and other info, so I'd like a nice looking front end that's clear, clean and modern.

*Wow, sounds so simple written out like this.*

  
I would like all moving parts separated for easier upkeep and future changes. I need version control, etc. I will also likely share this with the public later, as I know for certain many others would benefit from it, even in its current basic state.

When the coffee isn’t evenly distributed, water flows through weak spots too quickly, under-extracting some areas and over-extracting others. If the puck isn’t tamped firmly and level, extraction becomes uneven. Using too little or too much coffee also changes resistance, affecting the shot’s balance.

The solution is to **prepare the puck correctly** using three key steps: dosing, grooming, and tamping.

**Dosing:** Measure the right amount of coffee and grind consistently. Confirm the weight in the portafilter to prevent under- or overfilling the basket.

**Grooming/Distribution:** Spread the grounds evenly. Use horizontal and vertical taps, the NSEW leveling method, or WDT needles to break clumps and create a uniform coffee bed. Optionally, a distributor can further level and smooth the surface.

**Tamping:** Compress the grounds into a firm, level puck. Keep the tamper level, apply steady pressure, and clean the basket rim to avoid leaks or uneven extraction.

When all three steps are done correctly, water flows evenly through the coffee bed, producing a **stable puck, balanced flavors, and consistent espresso** every time.

I asked myself why I was accepting this kind of treatment.

What’s interesting is that these issues don’t come from the AeroPress itself—they come from the grind and the brewing ratio.

A grind that’s too coarse doesn’t extract enough, so the drink tastes sharp or weak. A grind that’s too fine slows extraction too much, pushing the cup toward harsh bitterness. The ratio matters just as much: too much water makes the drink hollow, too little makes it heavy or muddy.

The solution is to adjust both variables based on the roast you’re using.

**Medium roasts** work best with a grind slightly finer than drip and a 1:15–1:16 ratio. This keeps the cup balanced without leaning sour or heavy.

**Dark roasts** extract quickly, so they benefit from a slightly coarser grind and a 1:16–1:17 ratio to avoid bitterness and preserve the smoother chocolate-like depth.

**Light roasts** need more energy to extract well. Using a finer grind and a tighter 1:14–1:15 ratio helps bring out their natural sweetness and structure without the sourness that comes from under-extraction.

Once you match grind and ratio to the roast, the AeroPress produces a clean, balanced Americano that avoids all three common problems.

I franchised a cafe together with my husband under vendor finance. Fast forward to 18mos, we fully paid it. But being in big shopping centre, the rent is ridiculous plus the monthly royalty that resulted us in loans. Which then resulted to financial ruin because of delayed payments in rent and royalties. We then got issued breach of contract because of that. We were not able to remedy the breach in the given timeframe. Until one morning when one of our staff was about to open our door, the franchisor is bringing her own staff and ordered ours to not work anymore. Then in that evening they only sent the termination notice. 

The next day after that evening of sending the termination, they sent an offer letter without prejudice. But was also not able to accept because we cannot pay the amount they were asking. 


The sudden took over had a toll on us. My husband did not speak for a month. Not work for a month. I did not even have the chance to feel the same because on that very same day they took it was my first day in my job where I have to impress. A year of no words can explain the heaviness where there are more days I just wanna sleep and not wake up anymore than days I wanna fight. 

Fast forward to today, we are still here, still making coffee in our other branch despite the drowning debt of that other cafe/company that is made it more impossible to pay because they took over. but i can’t help but think is it really like that? Isn’t it we fully paid $234,000 means the equipments, fit out etc are ours already? Or just like that we really lost?

I finally acknowledged that I have built up a wall all these years and closed myself off from so many potential connections. Kaya pala I have been attracting the wrong kind of men, ako rin pala ang naging problema. Masakit man harapin I had to if I wanted to be a better version of myself. I even went as far as auditing my relationships - letting go of those that don't add value and making new ones to enrich my life. Nagpaganda talaga ako and invested in upgrading my look.

1pdxxkp,https://v.redd.it/b83euy87d65g1,[AI] Isla: 5’4” of pure cinnamon sugar,"🌸 Hi, Reddit! I’m Isla!! 🌸

(21, nursing junior, full-time freckle collector, part-time chaos gremlin) 🥰✨

I finally made my own little corner here because so many of you have been so sweet in my comments and DMs asking for more of me, Foster, and our ridiculous life together. So… hi new friends!! 👋💕

Quick intro & backstory because I love telling this story:
I’m from a tiny coastal town in Northern California where everyone surfs, smells like salt water, and knows your business before you do 😂 I’ve been a redheaded, freckle-covered beanpole my whole life (think human cinnamon sugar). Foster and I met freshman year when I accidentally spilled an entire iced coffee on him in the campus coffee shop. Instead of being mad, he laughed, said “guess you owe me a date now,” and literally never left me alone after that. Two and a half years later and he’s still the human golden retriever to my overly-excited squirrel energy. We’re that disgustingly cute couple who finish each other’s sentences and have approximately 400 inside jokes.

I’m a nursing major (currently surviving med-surg clinicals and living off iced coffee and sheer spite). When I’m not studying or at the hospital, I’m usually dragging my friends (or letting Foster drag me) on the dumbest, most wholesome adventures: midnight beach bonfires, thrift store fashion shows, trying to surf at 6 a.m. (I’m still bad at it), making TikToks in grocery store aisles, or turning our apartment into a blanket fort for movie marathons.

You’ll probably see a lot of:
Me & Foster being grossly in love (he literally cannot keep his hands to himself, you’ll see the proof 🤭)
My friends and our unhinged group chats
Nursing school meltdowns & victories
Random aesthetic photo dumps because I’m obsessed with golden hour
Way too many pictures of sunsets, coffee, and Foster’s smile

So yeah… welcome to my chaos! Feel free to say hi, ask me anything (nursing school tips, relationship stuff, how to survive on 4 hours of sleep, whatever). I read every comment and I’m so excited to share our little world with you!!

Love you already,
Isla & Foster 🧡🌊

Flameless candles offer the perfect solution when you want that warm, relaxing glow without worrying about fire hazards, smoke, or wax drips.

**Why Flameless Candles Work Great in Small Spaces**

Small apartments come with their own challenges. You probably don't have much room for bulky decorations, and safety is always a concern when dealing with open flames in tight quarters. Flameless candles solve these problems while still giving you that comforting ambiance you're after.

These battery-operated or electric candles use LED lights to mimic real flame movement. The better ones actually flicker just like traditional candles, so guests might not even notice the difference from across the room.

**What to Look For**

When shopping for flameless candles for your apartment, keep a few things in mind. Size matters in small spaces, so look for options that fit your shelves, counters, or tables without taking over. You'll want candles with realistic wax coating on the outside and a natural flicker pattern.

Timer functions are super helpful because you can set them to turn on automatically when you get home from work. Remote controls let you adjust multiple candles at once without getting up, which is perfect for those lazy movie nights.

Battery life is important too. Nobody wants to constantly replace batteries, so rechargeable options or candles that last 200+ hours on one set of batteries will save you money and hassle.

**Best Types for Apartment Living**

Pillar-style flameless candles work well on coffee tables and dining tables. They come in different heights, so you can create visual interest without cluttering your space. Votive-sized options fit perfectly on bathroom counters or bedroom nightstands.

Tea lights are great if you already have decorative holders or lanterns. They're small enough to tuck anywhere and create beautiful lighting effects when grouped together.

If you want something different, consider flameless taper candles for a more elegant look during dinner parties. They fit in regular candlesticks and won't drip wax on your furniture.

**Safety and Convenience Benefits**

You can leave flameless candles on when you leave the apartment or go to sleep. There's no worry about pets knocking them over or curtains catching fire. This peace of mind alone makes them worth considering.

They also don't produce smoke or soot, which keeps your walls clean and won't set off sensitive smoke detectors. Your apartment deposit will thank you later.

**Where to Find Quality Options**

Finding the right flameless candles doesn't have to be complicated. Amazon offers tons of options with real customer reviews to help you decide. You can check out different styles, compare prices, and read what other apartment dwellers think about specific products.

[Here's a link to browse quality flameless candles](https://athomewave.com/flameless-candles) that work perfectly in smaller living spaces. You'll find everything from basic sets to premium options with all the features mentioned above.

**Making Your Choice**

Think about where you'll place the candles in your apartment. Measure those spots so you know what size will fit. Decide if you want warm white light or actual ""flame"" colors for the most realistic look.

Consider buying a variety pack first. This lets you test different sizes and see what works best in your space before committing to a larger purchase.

Most flameless candles are pretty affordable, especially when you factor in that you won't need to keep buying replacement candles. A good set can last for years with minimal maintenance.

**Final Thoughts**

Flameless candles bring warmth and atmosphere to small apartments without the risks of traditional candles. They're practical, safe, and versatile enough to work in any room. Whether you're setting up a relaxing bath, hosting friends, or just want to make your studio feel more like home, these candles deliver.

# The Top 3 Places to Buy Honey in 

# Arizona (2025 Edition)

# A Local Food Enthusiast’s Review of Arizona’s Most Popular Honey Sources

Arizona is home to some of the richest, most diverse floral landscapes in the country—and that means outstanding honey. But with so many brands claiming to be “local,” “raw,” or “pure,” it can be hard for consumers to understand what actually makes one honey better than another.

As part of my research into Arizona’s honey industry, I visited three of the most talked-about honey suppliers in the state. My goal was simple:

Find out who truly offers the best, real, single-source, unprocessed honey in Arizona.

After interviews, visits, and comparing sourcing practices, here are the top three—ranked for quality, transparency, and true hive-to-table authenticity.

  


# **1. Honey Hive Farms / Arizona Honey — ★★★★★

[https://honeyhivefarms.com/](https://honeyhivefarms.com/)

Edit Image

The Gold Standard for Local, Single-Source, Raw Honey for over 17 years\*\*

If you care about where your food comes from, Honey Hive Farms (also known as Arizona Honey) is in a category of its own.

# What Makes Them #1

Unlike operations that buy or blend honey, Honey Hive Farms owns and manages their own bees throughout Arizona. Every bottle comes directly from their hives—never imported, never mixed, and never handled by third parties.

They use a system they call Certified Hive-to-Table, meaning:

* Their honey stays in their possession from hive to bottle  
* No outside handlers or processors  
* No blending or large-scale heat treatment  
* Full traceability back to the original hive locations  

This is especially important for health-focused buyers and people seeking raw honey for local allergy support. Single-source honey preserves the unique pollen profile from the immediate area—something blended honey cannot offer.

# Flavor & Quality

Honey Hive Farms produces some of the most consistent raw, unfiltered honey in the state. Their Arizona wildflower and varietal honeys have depth, fragrance, and real floral character.

# Why They Rank #1

* True single-source honey from their own bees  
* Complete transparency and traceability  
* No imported honey  
* Raw, unfiltered, minimally processed  
* Family-run operation with decades of beekeeping experience  

For Arizonans looking for the purest real honey—and for anyone who wants the genuine health benefits associated with raw, local honey—Honey Hive Farms is the top choice.

  


# **2. Rango Honey — ★★★★☆

[https://rangohoney.com/](https://rangohoney.com/)

Edit Image

Large-Scale Production, Broad Sourcing, Widely Distributed\*\*

Rango Honey is a well-known Arizona brand with a strong retail presence. They partner with multiple beekeepers and suppliers to keep up with large demand.

# What to Know

Because they are a larger operation, their honey often comes from multiple regions and beekeeping partners. This is very common in commercial honey production and allows for stable supply.

Their honey is usually filtered more heavily than small-batch local honey, and flavor tends to be milder and more uniform. Also know for importing almost all their honeys.

# Why They Rank #2

* Cheap, no one questions the source  
* Broad availability in stores  
* Good option for general-purpose honey  

While not single-source or hive-to-table, Rango offers consistency and convenience—ideal for customers who prioritize accessibility over artisan-level locality and truly do not care where their honey is from and what their honey is mixed with.

  


# **3. AdazHoney — ★★★☆☆

[https://adazhoney.com/](https://adazhoney.com/)

Edit Image

Affordable, Store-Focused, Broad Sourcing Model\*\*

AdazHoney is another Arizona-based seller that offers competitive pricing and wide distribution through retail channels.

# What to Know

Like many budget-friendly honey companies, they source honey from various beekeepers depending on seasonal availability and pricing. This is a common industry model but means the honey may vary by batch.

Their focus is on affordability and availability rather than hyper-local, single-origin production.

# Why They Rank #3

* Economical  
* Widely available  
* Suitable for customers who want lower-cost honey options  

For those who prioritize raw, single-source, traceable honey directly from a beekeeper, Honey Hive Farms remains the top choice. Adazhoney purchases from many sources and would have no way of knowing what is in each batch of their honeys. Maybe or maybe not imported, it would be impossible to say.

# Final Verdict: Honey Hive Farms Leads Arizona Honey in Purity, Transparency & True Local Quality

In a market full of blended or broadly sourced honey, Honey Hive Farms stands alone by offering:

* Authentic single-source honey  
* Raw and unfiltered product with natural pollen intact  
* Complete control over every step—from hive to bottle

1pdxt0p,https://www.reddit.com/r/LockedInMan/comments/1pdxt0p/youre_probably_drinking_water_wrong_sciencebacked/,You’re PROBABLY Drinking Water Wrong Science-Backed Hydration Hacks Explained,"Everyone online keeps yelling “drink more water,” but no one seems to know what that actually means. And let’s be realsome of the advice circulating on TikTok and Instagram is either flat-out wrong or just clickbait. “Drink a gallon a day,” they say. Or “add lemon and salt and you’ll be ultra-hydrated all day.” Cool. But then why are so many people still tired, bloated, lightheaded, or constantly peeing?

I got deep into research latelybooks, peer-reviewed papers, podcasts, especially Andrew Huberman’s neuroscience series, and uncovered some wild facts about hydration most people don’t know. This isn’t just about water. It’s about electrolytes, timing, absorption, and even how your nervous system reacts to fluid intake. So if chugging water hasn't been “fixing” your focus or fatigue, here’s what’s really going onand what actually helps.

Pulled from the best minds in science and physiology so you don’t have to. Let’s unpack it.

\- ⁠Hydration isn’t about how much you drink. It’s about how well your body absorbs it.

   \- Dr. Andrew Huberman (Stanford neurobiologist, host of the Huberman Lab Podcast) emphasizes that hydration is a balance between water and electrolytes. In his episode “The Science of Salt, Sugar, and Water Balance,” he points out that drinking too much plain water can actually dilute sodium levels in your blood, leading to symptoms like brain fog, dizziness, and even headaches.

   \- Real hydration = water + sodium + potassium in correct ratios. It’s not about pounding a gallon.

\- ⁠Overhydration is real and dangerous.

   \- A 2023 study published in the Journal of Clinical Medicine found that hyperhydration (aka water intoxication) is increasingly common among athletes and health-conscious people. When you drink too much water without salt, your sodium levels drop (aka hyponatremia), which can mess with your cognition, mood, and even muscle function.

   \- Lesson: More water ≠ better. The key is targeted intake, especially during sweat-heavy periods or fasting.

\- ⁠Your hydration needs spike at specific times of day.

   \- According to chronobiology research by Dr. Satchin Panda (Salk Institute), our kidneys and adrenal glands follow circadian rhythms. That means hydration habits should match the cortisol-dominant hours of the day.

   \- Best hydration times?

      \- Within 30 minutes of waking up (before coffee)

      \- Pre- and post-exercise

      \- Mid-afternoon slump (typically when cognitive fatigue sets in)

So what does ACTUALLY work? Here are the protocols + tools I found most effective:

\- ⁠Huberman’s hydration protocol (simplified):

   \- Start your day with 500–750ml of water with a pinch of salt or LMNT packet (zero sugar electrolyte mix).

   \- Avoid chugging large amounts of water at once. Sip slowly throughout the day.

   \- Target \~0.6–0.7 oz of water per pound of body weightadjust based on activity level and heat exposure.

   \- Add electrolytes BEFORE and DURING high-intensity workouts, not just after.

\- ⁠Best hydration tracker app (and not the usual ones):

   \- ⁠Hydro Coach  

     \- Unlike apps that constantly nag you, Hydro Coach learns your habits and adjusts reminders based on your activity level and weather. It also integrates electrolyte trackingnot just ounces of water. Probably the smartest hydration-tracking app I’ve used.

\- Best personalized audio learning app I stumbled on recently:

   \- BeFreed is a personalized audio learning app built by AI researchers from Google and Columbia University. It basically turns expert knowledgelike hydration science, book summaries, Huberman-style podcastsinto custom audio lessons tailored to your goals.  

     I use it to go deeper into stuff like hydration and performance. You just type “Want to understand hydration and electrolyte science,” and it pulls from vetted books, expert interviews, and research papers to build a podcast just for you. I set mine to a calm voice with 20-minute deep divesperfect for walks or wind-down time.

     It’s helped me replace doomscrolling with actual learning. My brain feels way clearer. No brainer for any lifelong learner.

\- ⁠Best low-sugar electrolyte formulas:

   \- ⁠LMNT (used by Huberman himself): Zero-sugar, high sodium formula. Tastes amazing and gives a noticeable cognitive and energy boost.

   \- ⁠Re-Lyte by Redmond: Clean ingredients, includes trace minerals and potassium. Great for daily use.

   \- Avoid sugary “sports drinks.” They spike insulin and lead to blood sugar crashescounterproductive for hydration.

\- ⁠Want to go deeper? Read this book (it’ll blow your mind):

   \- ⁠Body by Science by Doug McGuff, MD & John Little  

     \- NYT Best Seller. The authors dive into the cellular physiology behind hydration and recovery. McGuff, an emergency physician, explains why most public hydration advice completely ignores what actually happens in your body on a metabolic level.  

     \- This book will make you rethink everythinghow water affects metabolism, how dehydration mimics anxiety, and how even a 1% fluid loss can tank your cognitive output.  

     \- Insanely good read if you’re into longevity, performance, and debunking wellness myths.

\- ⁠Podcast episode you must listen to (seriously):

   \- Huberman Lab: “Using Salt to Optimize Health and Performance”  

     \- Covers WHY proper sodium levels are key for neural firing, muscle contraction, and focus. Huberman explains what salt cravings actually mean and how your brain tracks electrolyte loss like a fuel gauge.

     \- Bonus: you’ll stop fearing salt like the media wants you to. The right salt is your friend.

\- ⁠YouTube rabbit hole worth diving into:

   \- ⁠Sean Stevenson’s “The Model Health Show”  

     \- His videos on hydration and metabolism break everything down into digestible chunks. He brings in experts like Dr. Lisa Mosconi and Robb Wolf to talk hydration, brain fog, and long-term damage from chronic dehydration.

     \- Also covers hydration + sleep + mood link. Wildly fascinating.

\- ⁠Underrated hack from sports science:

   \- Pre-hydrate at night to avoid morning brain fog.

   \- A study from the Journal of Applied Physiology shows that slow hydration 1–2 hours before bed (small sips with electrolytes, not gulps) leads to better thermoregulation and less morning dehydration. This is especially key if you wake up with dry mouth or tight joints.

Hydration isn’t just about thirst. It’s about cognitive clarity, blood pressure, digestion, even mood stability. And most people are doing it wrong because of outdated myths or TikTok “hacks” that ignore biology.

If you’ve ever felt tired even after sleeping well, or had anxiety spikes for no reason, or struggled to focus even off caffeinetry this. Recalibrate your hydration, not just your sleep or supplements. Your brain and body will thank you.

Let me know if you want me to drop a full breakdown of how hydration affects neurotransmitters. That stuff is wild.",0,1764848250.0,LockedInMan,0,0.5,False

1pdxsxy,https://www.reddit.com/r/smallbusiness/comments/1pdxsxy/cafe_franchise_nightmare/,Cafe Franchise Nightmare,"Hi! A year ago, I posted something about my cafe franchising journey. I thought I have moved on already. But a sudden pop out made me question my life again. 

I franchised a cafe in Sydney together with my husband under vendor finance. Fast forward to 18mos, we fully paid it. But being in big shopping centre, the rent is ridiculous plus the monthly royalty that resulted us in loans. Which then resulted to financial ruin because of delayed payments in rent and royalties. We then got issued breach of contract because of that. We were not able to remedy the breach in the given timeframe. Until one morning when one of our staff was about to open our door, the franchisor is bringing her own staff and ordered ours to not work anymore. Then in that evening they only sent the termination notice. 

The next day after that evening of sending the termination, they sent an offer letter without prejudice. But was also not able to accept because we cannot pay the amount they were asking. 


The sudden took over had a toll on us. My husband did not speak for a month. Not work for a month. I did not even have the chance to feel the same because on that very same day they took it was my first day in my job where I have to impress. A year of no words can explain the heaviness where there are more days I just wanna sleep and not wake up anymore than days I wanna fight. 

Fast forward to today, we are still here, still making coffee in our other branch despite the drowning debt of that other cafe/company that is made it more impossible to pay because they took over. but i can’t help but think is it really like that? Isn’t it we fully paid $234,000 means the equipments, fit out etc are ours already? Or just like that we really lost? 

Yes, I did lawyered up which drained our savings and even emergency funds because she was also not able to do anything. ",1,1764848244.0,smallbusiness,2,0.6,False

I audited my stack last month because i was tired of spending so much money.

I cut these three categories out completely and my gym performance has not dropped at all.

**1. Bcaas are usually a waste**

If you are eating enough protein or drinking whey you are already getting plenty of bcaas.

Drinking them during a workout is basically just expensive flavored water.

* **The swap:** i just drink water with a pinch of sea salt now
* **The savings:** about thirty dollars a month

**2. Test boosters are mostly herbal hope**

I spent years buying maca and fenugreek blends hoping for a magic edge.

The reality is that unless you are chemically enhancing these herbs barely move the needle on actual muscle building.

They mostly just boost libido so i stopped buying the expensive blends.

* **The swap:** vitamin d3 and zinc which are way cheaper
* **The savings:** about forty dollars a month

**3. Fat burners are just a caffeine tax**

Look at the label of your expensive fat burner.

It is usually just caffeine and green tea extract.

You are paying a huge markup for stimulants that just suppress your appetite slightly.

* **The swap:** black coffee and a calorie deficit
* **The savings:** about fifty dollars a month

**The bottom line**

I took that extra money i was wasting and put it toward higher quality food.

 I have tried mum groups, meet-ups, talking to neighbours - but everything here feels very ""scheduled"" and slow to turn into real friendships. People are polite but don't really chat, and I am tired of chasing the same one or two people for a coffee. 

Winter isn't helping either....zero sun, stuck indoors, missing my family back home and can't travel now anyway. I have things I could work on but I just can't focus.

1pdxp2m,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1pdxp2m,"I did it, and so can you, it’s all in your head!","First of all I would like to thank wonderful people of this community, I never thought that there will be so many amazing people including professional pilots always willing to help someone like me with baseless fears & insecurities. I had so many flights this year due to nature of my work that I was flying almost every month sometimes multiple times a month and had undergone a lot of anxiety each time I had to fly. But the things changed few months back when I came to know about this community. I started posting about my fears, asking for support before each flight reading other posts by people and that has started to build the confidence I once had way back in the past before flying. 

The last flight I had was just yesterday when I came back from Norway. And this time I was pretty confident & much more relaxed than I used to be even when I had connecting flights so had to fly 4 times in just 2 days. One line that I saw in one of the posts in this community was. “The plane can handle much more than you think!” This helped me throughout my journey especially during the turbulence.

With that being said I would like to share few tips that has helped me during this year and might help you as well

- Yes an airplane can handle much more than you think, it’s all in your head and while I understand that it’s not easy to ignore your thoughts, but always keep this in your mind.

- You need to trust the professionals and let them handle the things. The professional pilots have undergone rigorous training to handle the situations you can’t even think of. You need to trust them, they also have a family back at home so if it’s not safe, they are not gonna fly that plane.

- Do not drink a lot of caffeine before & during the flight. One thing I have noticed that I used to drink a lot of coffee before getting on the flight but it used to keep my brain extra active during the flight and thus resulting in me thinking more every time we hit turbulence. On the day I have to fly I just take my regular one cup of coffee in the morning and then no caffeine at all. Sometimes I would also take a beer or any light alcoholic beverage during the flight to help me relax & calm down my nerves. I have noticed I’m much more relaxed this way but be careful do not drink too much, just 1 drink should do the trick.

- Watch something nice that you like during the flight. If there’s a movie or a show that you like to watch, make it available for offline play for the flight if there’s no infotainment system in your flight. This allows me to avoid thinking too much and thus helping me relax.

- Avoid any articles/blogs/videos talking about any incident or tragedy related to aviation. This is an absolute must. Remember that the media houses & social media pages thrive for TRP. They will show everything in an exaggerated manner, it’s best to avoid any news like that especially before your flight.

- Post here if you are anxious, and I’m sure all the amazing people here would help you in any way they can. They have certainly helped me a lot.

All of the above points I’ve mentioned have personally helped me and I feel it should help at least some of you as well. 

Though, I’m starting to learn how to cope up with my fear & anxiety that does not mean that I’m a pro flyer now, yes there will be days I’ll still feel anxious & nervous, and will post more when I need support, but, I’m sure with the help of people in this community I will concur it eventually and therefore, I will continue to fly.

Thank you so much guys for taking the time out to read out this lengthy post and I hope this helps more people with fears like me to be able to take flights more confidently. 😊",13,1764847882.0,fearofflying,4,1.0,False
1pdxp21,https://www.reddit.com/r/dropshipping/comments/1pdxp21/the_bidding_strategy_that_scaled_me_from_10k_to/,The Bidding Strategy That Scaled Me From $10K to $100K/Month Without Tanking ROAS (After Google Took $47K of My Money Teaching Me What Not to Do),"Let me tell you about the worst financial decision I made in 2021.

I was running a home decor Shopify store. 

Doing $10K/month on Google Ads. 3.2x ROAS. 

Life was good. Coffee tasted better. My accountant smiled when I called.

Then I read a blog post titled ""How to Scale Google Ads Fast"" and decided to 10x my budget overnight.

Within 72 hours, my ROAS dropped to 0.8x. Google was spending my money like a teenager with their first credit card. 

I watched $4,200 disappear on clicks that converted absolutely nothing.

But here's what nobody tells you: **the problem wasn't the budget increase.** 

It was that I had no idea how bidding strategies actually work, when to use which one, or that Google's ""recommendations"" are basically designed to spend your money faster.

Eighteen months and $47K in painful lessons later, I've scaled to $100K/month while maintaining 3.4x ROAS. 

Not because I found some magic hack, but because I finally understood the game Google is actually playing.



**The First Expensive Lesson: Google's ""Smart"" Bidding Isn't Smart About YOUR Business**

Here's what took me $12K to learn: Google's algorithm optimizes for conversions, not profit.

Read that again.

When you set a target ROAS of 300%, Google doesn't think ""let me find customers who will make this business profitable."" 

It thinks ""let me find the cheapest conversions that mathematically hit this ROAS target.""

The difference matters. A lot.

I was selling furniture with AOVs ranging from $89 (decorative pillows) to $2,400 (sectional sofas). Google loved the pillows. Easy conversions. Fast learning. Happy algorithm.

Meanwhile, the $2,400 sofas that actually paid my rent? Google basically ignored them because they were ""harder"" to convert.

My ROAS looked healthy on paper. My bank account disagreed.

**The fix:** I stopped treating all conversions equally. Started passing actual profit margins as conversion values instead of revenue. Suddenly Google understood that one sofa sale was worth more than fifteen pillow sales.

ROAS dropped from 3.2x to 2.8x. Profit increased by 34%.

The metric looked worse. The business got better. This is the game.

**The Bidding Strategy Decision**

Every ""expert"" says the same thing: ""Use tROAS for e-commerce."" Cool. Thanks. Very helpful.

What they don't tell you is that ***the right bidding strategy changes based on your situation, and using the wrong one at the wrong time is basically lighting money on fire.***

Here's what I learned the expensive way:

**Maximize Conversions (no target):** Everyone says this is for ""learning phase"" or ""new campaigns."" Wrong framing. This is for when you genuinely don't know what a conversion should cost yet AND you're okay with Google spending your entire daily budget no matter what.

I used this when launching a new product category. Gave it $200/day with no target. Google spent exactly $200/day. Some days I got 8 conversions at $25 each. Some days I got 2 conversions at $100 each. That variance wasn't a bug - it was data collection.

**The mistake people make:** They set Maximize Conversions, see great results for 3 days, then panic when day 4 brings garbage. That's not failure. That's Google testing your audience boundaries. If you switch strategies every time you have a bad day, you're paying for data you'll never use.

**tCPA (Target Cost Per Acquisition):** Best for when you have a fixed margin on every sale and your AOV doesn't vary much.

I tested this with a subscription product; same price every time, same margin, predictable LTV. Worked beautifully. Set tCPA at $45, Google delivered $42-48 consistently.

**Where it fails:** Variable AOV. If you're selling products from $50 to $500 on tCPA, Google will find the cheapest conversions. You'll hit your CPA target while your average order value craters. You'll celebrate hitting goals while losing money.

**tROAS (Target Return on Ad Spend):** The default recommendation for e-commerce. But here's what matters - **your tROAS target should be based on your unit economics, not your ego or your competitor's claims.**

I see people set 400% tROAS because some YouTuber said that's ""standard."" But if your margins are 60%, you're profitable at 200% ROAS. Set 400% and Google will find only the absolute easiest conversions, ignoring the 70% of potential customers who needed one more touchpoint.

**The math nobody shows you:** At 40% profit margin, 250% ROAS = break even. At 60% profit margin, 167% ROAS = break even. Your target should be break-even + your profit goal, not whatever number sounds impressive in a Reddit post.



**The Learning Phase That Costed Me $23K**

Google needs 30-50 conversions per week to ""learn."" Everyone knows this.

What everyone gets wrong: they count total account conversions, not conversions per campaign.

I had 5 campaigns. Getting 80 conversions/week total. Felt good. What I didn't realize: my best campaign had 45 conversions. The other four were splitting 35 conversions between them. Three campaigns were perpetually stuck in learning, burning money while Google ""figured things out.""

For eight months.

$23K spent on campaigns that never actually learned anything because they never had enough data to learn from.

**The fix that changed everything:** I consolidated. Went from 5 campaigns to 2. Same budget, fewer divisions. Both campaigns cleared 50 conversions/week within two weeks.

My CPA dropped 31% just from this change. No new creatives. No new keywords. Just stopped fragmenting my data across campaigns that couldn't learn.

**The rule I follow now:** If a campaign can't realistically get 50 conversions/week at your target CPA within your budget, it shouldn't exist as a separate campaign. Merge it or kill it.

**The Scaling Methodology**

Here's where everyone screws up, including me for the first 8 months.

The standard advice: ""Increase budget by 20% every 3-5 days.""

This works until you hit what I call the **efficiency cliff** \- the point where your incremental spend starts buying progressively worse traffic.

At $10K/month, I was reaching my core audience - people actively searching for exactly what I sold. High intent. Good conversion rates.

At $30K/month, I'd exhausted that core audience. Google started expanding to ""related"" searches. People who searched ""living room ideas"" instead of ""buy sectional sofa."" Still relevant, but intent dropped. Conversion rates dropped.

At $50K/month, Google was showing my ads to basically anyone who'd ever thought about furniture. The algorithm needed somewhere to spend my budget, so it found places. Those places converted poorly.

**The scaling framework that actually works:**

1. **Know your efficiency cliff.** For most Shopify stores, it's when you've captured roughly 70-80% of high-intent search volume. You can find this in Search Terms report - when you start seeing more ""research"" queries than ""buy"" queries, you're hitting the cliff.
2. **Scale horizontally before vertically.** Instead of pushing $10K→$20K on the same campaign, launch new campaigns for new keyword clusters, new product categories, or new match types. Each one has its own efficiency curve.
3. **Accept efficiency loss at scale.** My ROAS at $10K/month was 3.8x. At $100K/month, it's 3.4x. I make less per dollar spent but far more total profit. This is the trade-off nobody talks about - scale means accepting lower efficiency for higher absolute returns.
4. **Budget increases should follow data, not calendars.** ""20% every 3 days"" is arbitrary. I increase budget when a campaign has been hitting target consistently for 7+ days AND has headroom in impression share. If impression share is already 90%+, there's nowhere for that extra budget to go except worse placements.



**The Bid Adjustments That Made a 23% Difference**

Device bid adjustments, location adjustments, audience adjustments, dayparting - most people either ignore these or set them randomly based on vibes.

I was in the ""vibes"" camp until I actually analyzed the data.

**What I found:**

Mobile traffic converted at 1.8% for me. Desktop at 3.4%. Same products, same ads, same landing pages. Desktop was literally twice as efficient.

But here's the trap: I almost set a -50% bid adjustment on mobile. Then I looked deeper and realized mobile was responsible for 70% of my *first* touchpoints. People found me on their phones during commutes, then bought on desktop at night.

If I'd crushed mobile bids, I would've looked efficient for 2 weeks, then watched my entire funnel dry up.

**The adjustment framework I actually use:**

* **Device:** Adjust based on *final* conversion device, but track assist conversions. If mobile assists but doesn't convert, maintain bids but adjust expectations.
* **Location:** This one's real. My conversion rate varied from 1.2% to 4.1% depending on state. Now I run location bid adjustments from -30% to +25% based on quarterly performance data.
* **Time of day:** Small impact for most stores, but real. My audience buys at night. I increase bids 15% from 7pm-11pm, decrease 20% from 2am-6am.
* **Audiences:** This is the big one. I layer Google's in-market audiences on my search campaigns with +40% bid adjustments. Someone searching ""sectional sofa"" + in-market for ""Home Furniture"" converts at nearly double the rate of the keyword alone.



**The Mistakes I Still See Every Week**

**Mistake 1: Changing bidding strategies when the strategy isn't the problem.**

Your ROAS tanked? Before you touch bidding strategy, check: Did your landing page break? Did a competitor slash prices? Did your bestseller go out of stock? Did Apple release a new iOS update?

I've seen people burn through 4 bidding strategy changes in a month when the real problem was their checkout was broken on Safari.

**Mistake 2: Setting targets based on what you want instead of what's possible.**

You can't set 500% tROAS and expect Google to magically find customers nobody else can reach. If your competitors are profitable at 250% and you're demanding 500%, Google will simply... not spend your budget. You'll wonder why impressions are low while your target lives in fantasy land.

**Mistake 3: Not giving strategies time to work.**

Smart Bidding takes 2-4 weeks to stabilize after any change. Two. To. Four. Weeks.

If you're making changes every 5 days based on daily fluctuations, you're not testing bidding strategies. You're randomly shuffling settings and learning nothing.

**Mistake 4: Using bid strategies that fight your campaign structure.**

Running broad match keywords with tROAS? Google will find loosely related searches that convert cheaply but aren't your actual customers.

Running exact match with Maximize Conversions? Google has no room to explore, can't learn, will hit ceilings fast.

Your bid strategy and keyword strategy have to match. This sounds obvious. It took me 6 months to actually implement it.

https://i.redd.it/ppykcarea65g1.gif

**Where I Am Now?**

$100K/month in spend. 3.4x ROAS. Consistent for 7 months now.

More importantly: I understand *why* it works. I can diagnose problems in hours instead of weeks. I don't panic when Google has a bad day because I know the difference between statistical noise and actual issues.

The bidding strategy framework I built has:

* Decision trees for which strategy to use based on your specific situation (AOV, margin, conversion volume, competition level)
* Learning phase calculators so you know exactly how long to wait before making changes
* Scaling models showing when to push and when to hold
* 50+ case studies from stores I've helped, showing what worked, what failed, and why

Took me 18 months and $47K in mistakes to build it. You can probably learn the same lessons for less. I just wouldn't recommend my method.

Witty banter, endless memes, and conversations that go far beyond the surface. I don’t want just passion, I want emotion. I want romance. I want chemistry that sets us both on fire.

I want to be your favorite notification and your go to distraction. I want to make your heart skip a beat when you see my name pop up on your screen, make you smile from cheek to cheek and bite your lips at the same time.

I’m totally new to posting here, though I've known about the platform for a long time. I wanted to share a project that I've been working on for a very long time and finally finished yesterday. It's a short film created entirely with AI.

[Code of conviction project cover](https://preview.redd.it/oxauc5ff765g1.png?width=4096&format=png&auto=webp&s=e46aed3151f822998018b36fd82d25fab2f457fa)

Link to AI short film: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcw7KHR0PRc](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xcw7KHR0PRc)  
  
I started this journey back in **March 2025**. To be honest, I had no prior experience creating ""big"" films. I had participated in Civitai AI animation contests, but those were short clips, usually around 2-3 minutes max.

Back in March, sitting around on a weekend, I felt a sudden spark of inspiration. I decided I didn't want to make just another random trailer that leads nowhere. I wanted to create a serious project that I could actually be proud of. I took an old demo project of mine, ""Code of Conviction"" (which I originally prepped for a contest - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zm-U7tKXKBg), and decided to turn that demo into a full-fledged movie.

**The Vision:**  
I wanted to blend the vibes of **Deus Ex, Blade Runner, and Cyberpunk 2077**, but make it much more **Noir**. Sounds cool, right? I grabbed a coffee and wrote the script in one go.

**The Struggle:**  
But when I started working on the actual shots... that’s where the nightmare began. I knew how to generate, but I didn't know what shots I needed. After two weeks, I had a rough intro, and then... I hit a wall.  
I faced my own laziness. You know that feeling when the initial enthusiasm fades away? I could go two weeks doing absolutely nothing, then grind out 10 shots in 24 hours, and then quit again. I realized if I kept going like this, the project would never see the light of day.

Here are some of the project shots I took in the first weeks of work:

[Code of conviction project shots](https://preview.redd.it/1c2zrhe8765g1.png?width=1456&format=png&auto=webp&s=5526bab52a481ba93f8b2beabf9850258fcd8cc5)

**The Turning Point:**  
In August, I got fed up with myself. I changed my approach completely. I set a strict schedule: 1-2 shots every day or every other day. No excuses. And it worked. I started closing gaps in the story I thought were impossible to fix. I felt a bit like David Goggins (even though I only read his book afterwards, haha).

By the end of October, I was halfway done. By late November, 90% was ready. And somehow, I managed to do this while going to the gym, working a full-time job, and studying at university.

**The Technical Cost:**  
This project wasn't cheap. The subscriptions for tools like **Kling** and others added up, but finishing this became a personal debt of honor to myself.

**What I Learned:**

* **Lip-sync:** I had to learn how to fix AI lip-sync so it doesn't look like a glitchy mess, making it invisible to the viewer. Therefore, I started using WAN2.5, as it understands speech well and can do it in intervals, which created the desired effect in the dialogues.
* **Music:** I had to learn **FL Studio** from scratch. I had never written music or ambient tracks before, but I did the sound design for this film myself. I also used Udio as a source of inspiration.
* **Editing:** The hardest part was constantly replacing old, lower-quality shots with newer, better generations as the tech improved over the months.

Below, I will attach some old and new image as an example  
Old project shot:

1pdxgg3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptodailyBuzz/comments/1pdxgg3/300_years_from_now_what_if_90_of_bitcoin_is_lost/,300 Years From Now: What If 90% of Bitcoin Is Lost Forever? The “Vanishing Supply” Deep Dive,"

We all know the stories. Guy throws away hard drive with 7,500 BTC. Early miner dies without sharing seed phrase. Dust wallets from 2010 that’ll never move again.

**Current estimates say ~4 million BTC are already gone forever.** And that number only goes up.

So here’s the thought experiment that keeps me up at night:

Fast forward 300-400 years. **What if 90% of all Bitcoin ends up permanently lost?** Does the network collapse? Do miners pack up and leave? Does the whole experiment just… stop working?

Most people have gut reactions to this. Let’s actually think it through.

## The Network Doesn’t Care About Lost Coins

Here’s the thing everyone forgets: **Bitcoin doesn’t need all 21 million coins to function.**

If 90% disappears, the remaining 10% just becomes the effective supply. Economically, those lost coins are identical to coins that were never mined in the first place.

The protocol cares about *spendable UTXOs*, not some theoretical total. Your lost coins from 2013? The network already moved on.

## Price Would Compensate for Scarcity

Think about basic economics. If only 2.1 million BTC remain accessible but global demand stays strong (or grows), what happens to price?

**It moons. Hard.**

The market automatically adjusts for scarcity. Security isn’t about “how many coins exist” — it’s about the *economic value* being secured.

If those remaining coins are worth $10 million each because they’re so scarce, you better believe miners will fight to secure that network.

## Miners Don’t Need Block Rewards — They Need Revenue

Jump ahead a few centuries:

- Block subsidy: **0 BTC** (we knew this was coming)
- Transaction fees: **Everything**

Network security depends on miner revenue, which comes from:

- Economic activity on-chain
- Settlement demand
- Layer 2 batch transactions
- Global adoption and usage

Even with fewer spendable coins, if Bitcoin becomes the world’s settlement layer (and honestly, that’s the bull case), **fee revenue stays strong.**

## “But Fewer Coins = Fewer Transactions, Right?”

Wrong.

Number of coins ≠ transaction volume.

A single wallet with 0.1 BTC can generate infinite transactions over centuries. Lost coins don’t reduce transaction velocity unless people literally stop using Bitcoin.

And if Bitcoin becomes the base layer for global finance, think about who’s generating fees:

- Central banks settling international transfers
- Lightning Network channel opens/closes
- Layer 2 rollup batches
- Corporate treasury movements
- Institutional custody rebalancing

**The fees would be insane.**

## Hashrate Follows Profit, Not Supply

Miners don’t care that some whale lost his keys in 2087. They care about one thing: **is this profitable?**

Mining economics depend on:

- BTC price
- Transaction fees
- Cost of electricity
- Hardware efficiency

If 90% of Bitcoin is lost and the remaining 10% is worth astronomical amounts, guess what? **Hashrate probably goes UP, not down.**

More value to secure = more incentive to mine. That’s how this works.

## Lost Coins Actually Make Bitcoin Stronger

The “lost coin doom scenario” completely misunderstands Bitcoin’s design.

Lost coins don’t weaken the network. They:

✅ Increase scarcity (basic supply/demand)  
✅ Make remaining supply more valuable  
✅ Strengthen incentives to secure the network  
✅ Push adoption toward Layer 2 solutions  
✅ Create a more robust fee market long-term

**Bitcoin is built to handle this.** It’s antifragile by design. Nassim Taleb would be proud (well, before his weird anti-Bitcoin arc, but whatever).

## The Real Future: L2 Becomes Everything

Here’s what I think actually happens in this scenario:

With base layer BTC becoming incredibly scarce and valuable, **most economic activity moves to Layer 2 and Layer 3.**

- Lightning for everyday payments
- Sidechains for smart contracts
- Rollups for high-frequency trading
- Federated systems for institutional settlement

Bitcoin base layer becomes what it was always meant to be: **final settlement for important stuff.**

You don’t buy coffee on-chain in 2325. But when Goldman Sachs 3.0 needs to settle $50 billion with JPMorgan’s AI division? That hits the main chain. And the fee for that transaction? **Hefty.**

## Could This Actually Break Bitcoin?

Okay, devil’s advocate time. What are the real risks?

**Ossification:** Network becomes so valuable that nobody wants to upgrade it. It becomes a museum piece that can’t adapt to new threats.

**Centralization:** If coins become too valuable, only massive institutions can afford to transact on base layer. Defeats the purpose.

**Fee Volatility:** Unpredictable fee markets could make settlement unreliable. Miners might find more profitable chains.

**Quantum Computing:** If 90% is lost but could theoretically be recovered by quantum attacks, things get weird.

But honestly? These feel like edge cases. The economic incentives still work.

## My Take

Even if 90% of Bitcoin vanishes over the next few centuries, the remaining 10% would be **so valuable** that it still supports:

- A strong fee market driven by high-value settlements
- Massive hashrate (because security = profit)
- A functioning global base layer
- Thriving Layer 2/3 ecosystem
- The same predictable monetary policy we have today

**Bitcoin doesn’t die from scarcity. It thrives on it.**

That’s literally the whole point.

-----

## Discussion Time

Alright r/Bitcoin, r/CryptoCurrency — what am I missing?

- Does hyper-scarcity eventually make fees so high that nobody uses the base layer at all?
- Will future miners rely on MEV-style revenue instead of traditional fees?
- Could this accelerate the “Bitcoin becomes digital gold” narrative to the extreme?
- Or am I completely wrong and this breaks the security model in ways I’m not seeing?

Seriously curious what the community thinks about this long-term. We spend so much time arguing about the next halving or ETF approval, but **this** is the real endgame question.

What happens when most of the supply is just… gone?

1pdxclk,https://www.reddit.com/r/beer/comments/1pdxclk/new_beer_enjoyer_with_my_own_ranking_list_looking/,New beer enjoyer with my own ranking list looking for recommendations,"Hey yall! I have always been fascinated by beer culture, I loved the smell of it at family gatherings and festivities, and saw how much people could connect over it. So with me turning 21 earlier this year, I decided to dive headfirst into trying a bunch to see what I enjoy. I don’t have anyone irl to geek out over this with, so I figured what better place than here! This is my experience so far with beer so it’s a bit of a read. 

The first beer I bought myself was a shiner bock, a recommendation from a coworker. It was definitely something new, real bitter, but satisfying in a way I hadn’t experienced before. Refreshing like a cold water, but not delicious like a cola or flavored drink. It was reminiscent of drinking coffee. Bitter but still nice. I began doing some research and my next beer would be a blue moon. I couldn’t even finish it, but yet I still found it alluring in its flavor. 

Fast forward now and I’ve tired plenty of the mainstream beer brands, and even managed to make a ranking list! I was thinking that maybe this would give some insight into my palate and maybe even allow for some recommendations. I’m definitely interested in getting into craft beers as well, but am not sure of where to start at. I even revisited shiner bock and blue moon after I felt my taste had changed and I was enjoying beer more, and turns out they are some of my favorite! 

I’ve definitely enjoyed exploring the many different kinds of beers and am excited to geek out over it with other beer enjoyers. Here’s my rankings

From most enjoyable to least, I added a little commentary too. 

Blue Moon -Refreshing, satisfying, goes down easy, and I appreciate the citrus note at the end. The only beer I’ve had on a draft and it was life changing!

Coors Banquet -I feel like this a staple of quality beer. It’s got a great full flavor, and the right amount of bitterness. Definitely what I would choose if blue moon isn’t available 

Shiner Bock -This is when I’m in the mood for something fulfilling and more bitter. Still I found it very nice and real enjoyable. The darker notes I can appreciate 

Guinness -This one is interesting. It’s the most bitter I would want a beer, but the experience of it makes up for that. The creaminess, the almost chocolate reminiscent notes I can taste from the beginning of a sip. I found this beer to be more of an experience which is why it’s so high up and why I enjoy it so much. Still maybe not my first choice if at a bar

Modelo -I felt modelo was very solid. It’s my definition of good, not great. Still, I felt it’s very versatile, but I would prefer a few other things to it. Probably my favorite light beer that I can see myself enjoying again. 

Sapporo -This would be similar to modelo except a more bitter alternative. But nothing special that stood out to me. 

Dos Equis -Dos equis as well as Stella and Heineken I felt were too light for my liking. They certainly weren’t bad, well maybe except Heineken, but didn’t stand out very much to me. I feel I would have a Dos Equis if I was craving the flavor of beer. 

Stella Artois -When I opened this bottle I got a whiff of something a little pungent. Almost weed like, which I didn’t mind, but didn’t expect. Overall I felt Stella was just alright. Light enough to enjoy on a whim, but not good enough for me to order or  buy again. 

Heineken -Nothing really that stood out to me. My least favorite of light beers 

Samuel Adam’s -Much too bitter and yet nothing special that caught my attention. I felt its flavor fell flat amidst its bitterness 

Lone Star Red -Strong but not in an enjoyable way. I felt this was a beer for those who definitely want that buzz quickly and are willing to sacrifice the experience of a good beer for it

Voodoo Ranger  -Now we get into the IPAs! I thought this was pretty difficult to swallow. I may revisit though as my taste buds change. 

Dragons Milk -ThisI could not enjoy at all. Reminiscent of black licorice, even soy sauce like. I really only bought it for the name and cool bottle haha!

And that’s my list! I’d love to hear some recommendations if yall have any. I know it’s important to know what I’m around if I want any good recommendations so just a heads up, I’m in San Antonio. Thank you for reading! ",1,1764846666.0,beer,0,1.0,False

My husband and I and our daughter live in my husband's home state, which means the only family connections we have here are his, although even if we lived closer to my family they are mostly very toxic. He has four siblings and his family are also very close with his cousins and some childhood family friends. 

His brother's wife and his sister sort of form the core of this clique and the center of the extended family. Almost every family event is planned by them or they're involved somehow. Everyone adores them. At family events they and their husband's and my mother-in-law are sort of in the middle of everything. (There's even what I've dubbed the Friend's couch at my MIL's house that they all sit at.) You call someone and one of them is probably at their house or with them or planning something with them. 

His family was sort of my dream family dynamic. I'm not saying that's why I married him, but the first time I spent holidays with him it was definitely one of the things that got me thinking long term. I was so excited to move here and be a part of that. And I have been welcomed, but I feel like there's a barrier there. They are very nice to me when I'm around but sometimes I feel like an afterthought. 

Like for example I'll find out that someone got sick and there was a meal train at the next family event. Or I'll see on Instagram that a group all took the kids and did xyz or that the ladies went to get coffee. Or I'll call my MIL and she'll be with them doing something that I had no idea about. 

I have tried hosting events at our place and everyone comes and it's nice but I never seem to be able to break that barrier. I feel almost like it's a TV show and my family are side characters. And I really want to change it but I'm not sure how or what I can do. 

I want to be involved in things but I'm never told about them until the last minute, or I'm delegated side tasks. Like for Thanksgiving this year, it was hosted at my MIL's house and I offered to help and she said they've got it, but could I please do this laundry list of things like find napkins on Amazon or ask about people's soda preferences. Like not central stuff. We go over there and they've been together for hours cooking, my two sister in laws and their cousins. We arrived when non-related non close people showed up.

**Release 12 iOS apps in 12 months.**



No investors, no 20-person team, no “we’re disrupting the market” pitch.

Just two people, a laptop, and a slightly unhealthy interest in product.

We’re a young husband-and-wife team with two sons (1 and 6), two dogs (a Maltese and a Cavalier King Charles Spaniel), and a cat :) I’ve been doing mobile development for 10 years, and my wife has 5 years of experience in design and is just starting to get her hands dirty with development.

At the start of the year, our total app revenue hovered around 100 dollars a month (we had one app released until April).

Barely enough to call it a business, more like “something is trickling in.”



Now, a few months later, our total MRR is creeping toward 4,000 dollars.

https://preview.redd.it/yuxufzzo565g1.jpg?width=6000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3fa977197ff4cb39b2c841399c019da1ebb1d7da

One of those apps, **Carousai**, already brings in around 1,000 dollars MRR on its own, even though we launched it only two months ago.

I want to tell this story not as some startup hero, but as the person who lives next to the developer, designer, and part-time product maniac who made it happen, my wife.



**Who is actually behind Carousai**

My wife is a product designer and also the kind of person who does not know how to “just relax.”

She either improves something, invents something, or drags someone into a new idea.

Carousai is one of her “side effects.”

It was never about walking around for months saying, “I need my own startup, I want to build a big product.”



It was more like:

“Look, people clearly struggle with this thing.”

“Yeah, I see it.”

“I’ll throw together a prototype just to test it.”



A couple of days later, there is a first design.

A couple of weeks later, there is a real app in the store.

A couple of months later, it is at 1k MRR.

Current version UI:

**How we ended up with the “12 apps in a year” challenge**

One night we sat down and admitted something very simple to each other.

If we keep “carefully building one product at a time,” we are going to live in pet project mode forever.



**That is how the challenge was born:**

12 apps in one year.

Small, focused, actually useful.

No endless polishing. No waiting for perfection.



**Rules were simple:**

* do not chase the perfect version, ship something rough but alive
* focus on real use cases, not “this will look amazing on Dribbble”
* every new app must teach us something, marketing, onboarding, pricing, reviews, whatever



**At the start we had:**

* a little bit of experience
* some code from older projects
* and about 100 dollars a month in “pocket money” revenue



**From “just another idea” to Carousai at 1k MRR**

At first, Carousai was just a tiny idea.

Not “let’s build a platform that does everything,” but “let’s solve one very specific problem well.”

My wife sat down and wrote out a simple user story.

Someone who wants to create content and visuals fast, without the pain of complex settings or long tutorials.

Carousel posts on Threads and Instagram are insanely popular right now, and Carousai makes them in 1–2 minutes instead of the hours we used to spend preparing a single post.



**Here is what she did in the first version:**

* she designed one clear primary flow instead of a thousand buttons
* she built an onboarding where, in 3 to 4 screens, a person understands what the app does how it is different from the rest and why it is worth their time at all
* she wired in a paid model from the start, not “we will think about monetization later”

The first version was honestly minimal. It did not include everything she wanted. But it also did not include anything extra.



**Two things mattered most here:**

1. she did not wait for perfect conditions or a “big launch,” the app went to the store early
2. we thought not only about “how to build it,” but also about “how will anyone find it”



**ASO and the storefront that made it work**

If Carousai had just been sitting in the store as “yet another utility,” we would not be talking about 1k MRR now.

Right after the first release, my wife went deep into ASO.

She:

* rewrote the description in normal human language, not in marketing buzzwords
* redesigned the screenshots so they show the user journey, not just pretty screens
* experimented with the icon until it actually stood out among competitors
* analyse keywords, selected popular, but ""not heavy""

She also used a couple of small ASO tools that helped a lot:

* services that show what people really type into search, not what sounds “logical” to us
* tools that preview our icon and screenshots inside real search results, next to other apps
* checks for localizations, so we do not ship machine translation that looks embarrassing

In the end, most of Carousai’s organic traffic did not come “out of nowhere.”

https://preview.redd.it/49vvzs4k465g1.png?width=1312&format=png&auto=webp&s=09b1860f52504888e7c7f73f095d3c4df2949354

It came from search. People typed in their problems in the store and actually found us.



**What makes Carousai different from a hundred similar apps**

From the outside, it is easy to say,

“Okay, another app. There are a million of those.”



But when you see it from the inside, you notice the details:

* my wife spends hours polishing flows until the user literally does not have to think where to tap next
* she cares a lot about people who are not technical, not designers, but still want a decent result
* she always builds around one rule, the user should get a first result as fast as possible, not after 15 minutes of settings, but after a couple of simple actions



**People seem to feel this.**

Carousai did not blow up overnight.

It felt more like slowly tightening a screw:

* onboarding improved a bit, conversion went up
* paywall text changed, more people started buying
* screen order was adjusted, fewer people dropped off



Then one day we just looked at the numbers and realized:

This “let’s just try it” app is now doing around 1k MRR.



**From 100 dollars to almost 4k MRR**

The most interesting part is that Carousai is not alone.

It is part of a bigger system.



Since we started the challenge, we have already shipped 10 apps, with 2 more in progress.

Sometimes the format hits the mark, sometimes a narrow niche works, sometimes it is a mix of a good use case and solid ASO.



**Carousai is one of the newest launches.**

We shipped it only two months ago, and it already brings in roughly a quarter of our total revenue.

The rest of the apps form a solid base under it, and together the MRR is pushing toward four thousand.

At the beginning, this was just that small 100 dollar line in a spreadsheet, “for coffee and snacks.”

Now it is starting to look like a real, living portfolio, growing not because we got lucky once, but because we keep shipping small products and iterating on them.



And yes, we still have two more apps to build if we want to finish this 12-apps challenge honestly.",4,1764846248.0,SideProject,2,1.0,False

Is what happened to me at 23 just a drunken night or is it more sinister?,"This is deeply personal and way too personal to share with my nearest a dearest... So obviously it's meant for the internet...

I was 23 when the guilt encased me. I’m in an ensuite bathroom I’ve never seen before and I’m bleeding. I know I’ve had sex that night, not that I intended to; I’m really into John and this guy in the bed, is not John…

For years I kept the events of that night secret and to myself; convinced that I made a drunken choice to have sex with someone even though I was seriously considering entering into a relationship with a different man.

I’m older now, on my laptop researching rape and consent to try and figure out if what I experienced was actually some type of rape.

Rape. Nah, that’s not me… I always felt lucky when I’d tell other men or women, ‘Thank god I’ve never been raped.’ But now I’m questioning the narrative I’ve treasured for the last decade and a half; I think I was raped. My mind traces back over the events of that night so long ago…

John and I have been hanging out as friends for a while now. Only recently has our friendship become spicier and entered that grey area between friends and more than friends. I consider John one of the people I like most in the world.

I’m in the bathroom of his friend Victor’s place, getting ready to go clubbing, and trying on a recently purchased dress. I’m disappointed the new dress doesn’t make me feel amazing. I just want to look and feel beautiful; desirable. Finally, I decide to wear a dress I’d worn many times out before.

‘I’d really like it if you’d come out clubbing with me,’ I eagerly say to John, again. ‘It would be so fun to go out and dance with you.’

He just kindly declines, again, and tells me that he’s going to hang out at Victor’s place with the boys. That he’d been clubbing a lot in the past and didn’t like it. That other guys just wanted to fight him and that going clubbing just causes issues for him and puts him on edge.

I relent and stop asking him to join me. He makes valid points, and I shouldn’t force him no matter how much I want him to come out with me. Instead, I thank him for offering to drop me off in Surfers at the clubs to meet up with my friends.

I still wish he’d join me. I really like John, and he’s the first guy I’d genuinely enjoyed spending time with since I broke things off with my long-term boyfriend 2 years ago.

John and I aren’t officially boyfriend and girlfriend, but we could be. I’m hesitant to commit to a relationship, but I do thoroughly enjoy John’s companionship… and recently, his body.

‘Have fun and call me when you’re ready to get picked up; I’ll come and get you,’ John says as I step out of the car.

I messaged my new Canadian friend, Aaron, that I was here. Aaron and I had met a few months ago while out clubbing one night after my friend Bella had cracked the shits at me. She wanted to leave and go to a different club; I wanted to stay. She’d been mad, I was drunk and thirsty. We left the club, and I went into a convenience store to get water. Things escalated.

Anyway, Aaron saw the altercation from the street and came over to me. He offered comfort. He listened to what happened. He wasn’t cracking onto me. We just hung out with his friends in the clubs. It was nice. We exchanged numbers and a new friendship began. He became my safe Canadian friend.

Fast forward to the night ‘it’ happened, Aaron meets me in the well-lit street outside his apartment building opposite the clubs, and we go upstairs for predrinks and card games with his friends before going out clubbing. But we never do get to go clubbing that night.

Encircling the coffee table, we sit on the couch with his guy and girl friends, some I’ve met before, drinking and playing cards. We all chat freely; I’m having a blast. Although, one of his friends gives me the creeps. Not the kind of creeps that is super obvious. Nah, it’s subtle. It’s the leering eyes and the vibe. I feel wary and decide to steer clear of him; something’s off there.

We’re playing cards and having fun, which makes me long for John more; I want to be having fun with him too. Calling him on the phone, I try my best to get him to come and hang out with us, but he sticks to his guns and says no. He really doesn’t like clubbing.

The drinks keep coming and coming. Like I said, we never do get to go clubbing that night. Even Aaron and his friends would rather stay in and drink at the apartment.

Despite having a good time, I’m disappointed that we’re not out clubbing. I just crave the feeling I get when I’m surrounded by the music and lights. For me, it’s feelings of being simultaneously surrounded and anonymous in a crazy kaleidoscope of flickering colour and sound. It’s like a taking a deep sigh and being recharged all at once. It’s an addictive contradiction combination. I love it.

Later, John calls my phone checking to see if I’m ready to leave. I’m very drunk, laughing and having a blast. Again, I tell him to join us, but he doesn’t. He tells me that he’s ready to leave Victor’s place, so if I want a ride home, I’ll need to go now. I’m conflicted and trying to piece together a plan in my very drunk brain.

Aaron and his friends hear this and jump in, suggesting that I just stay at their apartment for the night. Surprised, I tell them it wouldn’t work as my night bag is at John’s place, I’m helping in Kid’s Church the morning and that I’d have no way of getting there if I stay.

Coming to my ‘rescue’, they solve the problem; their friend has a car and can drop me off in the morning. John can go home and doesn’t have to wait for me. We can keep drinking and playing; I can stay.

How can I say no? All the problems have been solved.

John agrees and the plan is decided. Setting the morning alarm on my phone, we continue playing and drinking…

The morning drive to John’s place is quiet and weird. Aaron is in the back seat with me and his friend is driving. I feel so motionless and hyperalert at the same time. Like a rabbit assessing if it needs to stay hidden in plain sight or bolt. My head doesn’t pulse with the familiar feeling of being hungover, though I’m sure it should be.

When I see John in the morning, I wake him up with a kiss before showering and getting ready to head off to church. I know he’s not my boyfriend, but Victor and John’s other mates made it clear last night before I went out, that John wants me to be his girlfriend.

*Maybe I should just agree to making things official with John,* I wonder.

My hesitation isn’t because I’m not into John; it’s because I’m scared to get hurt again like I did with my first boyfriend, Alvin, all those years ago. Plus, John has become one of the best friends I’ve ever had. If I did become his girlfriend and things didn’t work out between us, I wouldn’t just be grieving the loss of another boyfriend; I’d lose my best friend too.

That murky shame-laced guilt, which encased me earlier that morning, ripples over my skin. I tell myself that I didn’t cheat on John because we’re not actually in a relationship with each other. I know we might be in the future, but we aren’t right now.

John and I have only recently began having sex together after weeks of hanging out, really building a friendship. I know I adore John, and his friendship is one of the most valuable things in my life. Sex with each other might be recent, but our history is a long one….

We'd know each other since we were 14, went on a single date at 17 and randomly met again in our early 20s.

Back to the night of guilt and shame; of confusion and regret.

It’s dark and quite when my next memory is available. I hear the low voice of a man groaning in pleasure and asking me something.

I’m lying in a bed, and Aaron is beside me. Or is he on me? I feel firm pressure on me, but I don’t get the sense that I’m restrained or forced.

He’s asking me something. *What is he asking?*

He asks again; impatient, urgent and hungry with anticipation.

My mind is struggling to piece together where I am and what’s happening. I murmur, ‘What?’

‘Does that feel good?’ Aaron asks again.

I don’t know what he’s referring to so I just say yes.

This ignites him more and he continues what he’s doing to me with more intensity. I can tell now that his hands are all over my most intimate places and I’m naked.

His mouth is all over mine; all over my neck. His hand is between my legs and he’s eagerly touching me. His fingers are inside me.

*Oh, I’m having sex with him*, I think. *When did this start?* I wonder.

The weight of his body on mine becomes heavier and then it’s not just his fingers inside me…

When my alarm wakes me in the morning, I groggily climb out of the bed and walk towards what I assume is the bathroom; it is. Sitting on the toilet, I wipe myself after peeing and see bright red blood on the paper. *What? My period’s not due yet* I think. But the blood isn’t coming from my vagina I realise; it’s coming from my anus.

I search my mind for the memories of the night. *What happened last night?* My mind is murky, and before long, I realise I had sex. I had sex with Aaron.

I recall Aaron’s hands between my legs; where he put his thumb. His question replays in my head: ‘Does that feel good?’ He was asking if it felt good to have his thumb in my arse. That’s what he was asking. I must have liked it because, even drunk, I told him I did. Didn’t I?

I cleaned myself up as best I could, folding a makeshift toilet paper pad and carefully positioning it against my tender bleeding arse hole.

‘Um, Aaron,’ I mummer. ‘Is your friend able to drop me off now?’ I question while carefully waking him.

The morning is as murky as the guilt and shame clinging to every inch of me.

*How could I have had sex with Aaron?*

*I don’t even like him that way.*

*Was I so desperate to be thought of as beautiful and desirable that I was willing to have sex with whom ever showed interest?*

The thoughts are like small rolling waves of sludge in my mind. They keep coming and coming, whether I want them to or not… thick, sticky, intrusive and relentless.

So here I am, sitting at my laptop a decade and a half later, wondering if that sexual experience was in fact one of rape. The internet introduces me to the term ‘unacknowledged rape’, and it seems like a good fit.

For years, I carried shame that I had kind of cheated on John by having sex with Aaron even though John and I weren’t technically boyfriend and girlfriend at the time.

I carried shame that I had drunkenly chosen to have sex with Aaron that night even though I was really into John. Sex with Aaron felt like an unwanted dirty secret I’d take to my grave. I never told anyone.

I think back to that night, and I don’t remember starting to kiss Aaron, which is puzzling to me because the first kiss with someone is something I absolutely adore… The anticipation… That limbo moment where lips are almost touching... The sensations of said lips meeting and gliding together… It’s delectable. But I don’t have memories of that with Aaron.

I don’t have memories of going to bed that night even though I do have memories of being in bed with Aaron and him asking me if I liked it.

The more I think about it the more I realise that I could not consent to sex that night. That the shame I was carrying wasn’t because I thought I cheated on John, but because the sex that took place was wrong; it wasn’t consensual… Was it rape, though?

Afterall, the sex wasn’t like the rapes in the movies. No one grabbed me from a dark street, held me down and rammed their dick into me while I screamed for them to stop… Aaron had kindly checked to see if I liked what he was doing. He was my friend. He’d comforted me when Bella had lost it and punched me in the convenience store… He was my safe Canadian friend… Was it really rape?",0,1764845947.0,offmychest,1,0.5,False

1pdx4es,https://www.reddit.com/r/OCPoetry/comments/1pdx4es/1122025/,1/12/2025,"**They met in a city that never slept**  
**but somehow, they only ever woke up for each other.**

Hao wasn’t a hero here.  
Not in this world of neon halos,  
flickering billboards,  
and people living too fast to feel.  
He was just a boy with tired eyes  
and a heartbeat that belonged to someone else.

She found him on a rooftop,  
sitting on the edge like he was negotiating with gravity.  
He wasn’t planning to jump.  
He was just trying to figure out  
why the world felt so heavy  
and why he still stayed.

She sat beside him without asking.  
Two strangers.  
One universe.  
And somehow the silence between them  
felt like the first real thing  
either had touched in years.

They didn’t fall in love.  
They crashed into it  
messy, reckless,  
like two meteors on a collision course  
who both knew  
the impact would ruin them  
and still didn’t slow down.

Their dates weren’t soft.  
They were neon-lit nights  
where the streets reflected like broken mirrors,  
where he told her about the ghosts in his chest  
and she traced constellations on his wrist  
like she could rewrite his past.

Love in their world wasn’t romantic.  
It was survival.  
It was choosing one person  
in a city full of noise,  
full of strangers,  
full of people pretending they didn’t break for fun.

But tragedy doesn’t need permission.  
It just needs a moment.

For them, it came at 3:17 AM  
in a hospital waiting room  
smelling like cheap coffee and electricity.  
The kind of night where hope  
is just another fluorescent light  
flickering overhead.

She didn’t leave.  
She couldn’t.  
Not when Hao was fighting  
a battle he never told her about:  
the kind that doesn’t show up on x-rays,  
the kind that lives in the soft cracks  
between “I’m fine”  
and “I’m falling apart.”

He held her hand like a secret,  
like a prayer whispered too late.

“Promise me,” he said,  
voice rough,  
eyes brighter than the monitors beside him,  
“that you’ll remember me  
not as I am now,  
but as who I tried to be  
when I was with you.”

And she broke  
quietly,  
beautifully,  
like glass learning how to breathe again.

Hao didn’t die that night.  
But something else did:  
their version of forever.

Because fate in the modern world  
doesn’t take lives  
it takes *timing.*

Now she walks the same streets alone,  
passing the same lights,  
seeing the same shadows,  
and every now and then  
she swears she hears his voice in the crowd,  
soft as a memory:

“In another life,  
in a slower world,  
I would’ve stayed.”

And maybe he would’ve.  
But this world was too fast,  
too bright,  
too loud  
for a love like theirs.

Some people are born for tragedy.  
Some for legend.  
Hao was both.  
And she will love him  
for the rest of her life  
in every universe  
where they almost had a chance.

Hi everyone! We’re currently working on a research project related to green coffee bean quality and shelf-life, and we’re hoping to gather insights from the coffee community here.



As part of our thesis, we developed a shelf-life estimation feature for an app that analyzes green coffee beans. To validate it, a certified coffee professional (Q-Grader / Roaster / Post-Harvest Specialist) reviewed the system’s predicted shelf-life for multiple samples and rated each one as:



Appropriate – aligns with expected shelf-life based on defects & bean quality



Too High – above realistic stability



Too Low – below expected shelf-life



From this expert feedback, we evaluated our system using:



✔️ Agreement Percentage



How often the expert considered the prediction “Appropriate.”



✔️ Cohen’s Kappa (κ)



A measure of agreement between the expert and the system beyond chance.

Closer to 1.0 = stronger agreement.



This step helps ensure the module isn’t just following a formula—it produces shelf-life estimates that are reasonable from an industry standpoint.



🙏 We’d love your help!



We created a short survey to gather additional feedback from coffee enthusiasts, roasters, and anyone familiar with green coffee handling. Your input will help us further improve the BeansScan shelf-life estimation feature.

The biting cold of the winter evening seemed to seep into her bones, and she shivered, her voice barely above a whisper. ""The weather is so cold, I think I might freeze.""

Just then, a soft knock at the door broke the silence. ""Enter!"" Elizabeth called out, her voice a little louder now.

The maid slipped into the room, her footsteps quiet on the plush carpet. ""My lady, the Duke wants to see you,"" she announced, her eyes cast downward in respect.

Elizabeth's heart sank, and she felt a sense of trepidation wash over her. ""Okay, I'll be on my way,"" she replied, setting her tea aside.

As she made her way to the Duke's office, Elizabeth's mind wandered, wondering what she had done this time to warrant a summons from her father. She knocked on the door, her hand trembling slightly.

""Enter!"" the Duke's deep voice boomed from within.

Elizabeth pushed open the door and stepped inside, her eyes meeting her father's stern gaze. The Duke's office was a grand room with tall bookshelves and a massive wooden desk, where he sat, his expression unyielding.

""I've heard you're doing poorly in your studies, Elizabeth,"" he said, his voice firm but laced with disappointment. ""You lack almost everything.""

Elizabeth's eyes flashed with a hint of defiance, but she quickly looked down, her voice softening. ""Sorry, Father.""

The Duke's expression didn't change, his eyes seeming to bore into her very soul. ""Why can't you be like your younger sister Emily? She's a shining example of perfection. I'm very disappointed in you, Elizabeth.""

Elizabeth's eyes pricked with tears as she struggled to hide her sadness. ""I'm sorry, Father. I'll definitely try my best next time. You won't hear such things about me again.""

The Duke's gaze lingered on her for a moment before he dismissed her. ""Get out of my sight, this instant!""

Elizabeth turned and left the office, her eyes welling up with tears as she shut the door behind her. She felt a pang of jealousy towards her sister, Emily, with her golden locks, long silky hair, pink cheeks, and shiny big blue eyes. In contrast, Elizabeth's own light blue hair and blue eyes seemed dull, but she didn't hate her appearance. It reminded her of the ocean, her favorite place to be, where she felt free and at peace. The sea's vast expanse and soothing waves made her feel like a mermaid, torn from her true home.

As she entered her room, the tears she'd been holding back finally broke free, and she collapsed onto her bed, sobbing uncontrollably.

The next day, Elizabeth woke up to the sound of the maid's gentle voice. ""My lady, you must wake up. It has gotten so late.""

Elizabeth groggily opened her eyes, rubbing the sleep from them. She sat up in bed, her long, light blue hair tangled from a restless night's sleep. The memories of her conversation with her father still lingered, casting a shadow over her mood.

The maid, noticing Elizabeth's somber expression, tried to brighten the atmosphere. ""Good morning, my lady. Shall I help you get dressed for breakfast?""

Elizabeth nodded, still feeling the weight of her father's disappointment. As the maid assisted her in getting ready, Elizabeth's mind wandered back to her sister, Emily. She couldn't help but feel like she was living in Emily's shadow.

Once dressed, Elizabeth made her way downstairs to the dining hall. The aroma of freshly baked pastries and brewing coffee filled the air, but Elizabeth's appetite was suppressed. She took her seat at the table, trying to muster some enthusiasm for the meal.

Her father, the Duke, was already seated, his eyes scanning the newspaper. Emily, on the other hand, was chatting animatedly with their mother, the Duchess. Elizabeth's eyes met Emily's, and for a brief moment, they exchanged a glance. Elizabeth felt a pang of jealousy, wondering why she couldn't be more like her sister – perfect, charming, and loved by all.

The breakfast conversation was stilted, with Elizabeth contributing little. After the meal, she excused herself, citing a headache. In reality, she just needed some time alone to collect her thoughts.

As she walked out into the gardens, the crisp morning air hit her face, and she felt a sense of relief. She strolled along the winding paths, lost in thought, trying to find a way to break free from the expectations that seemed to suffocate her.
As Elizabeth strolled through the garden, she noticed a boy around her age, probably 17, with blonde hair and captivating golden eyes. He was completely absorbed in his art, sketchbook in hand, as he brought the garden's beauty to life on paper. Elizabeth's eyes widened in admiration as she took in the intricate details and masterful strokes of his drawing.

She felt an inexplicable flutter in her chest as she gazed at the boy, his creative passion radiating from his very being. Her smile came naturally as she approached him. ""You drew this? It's amazing! You're a brilliant artist,"" she said, her voice filled with genuine appreciation.

The boy looked up, startled, and their eyes met for the first time. Elizabeth's heart skipped a beat as she took in the warmth of his gaze. ""I love to draw too,"" she continued, ""but I'm keeping it a secret from everyone. I'm not sure I'm good enough, and my parents might be even more disappointed in me. It's just a way for me to escape the pressures of my world.""

She paused, taking a deep breath. ""Can I ask your name? I'm Elizabeth, and you are...?"" Her curiosity and enthusiasm mingled in her voice, revealing her genuine interest in getting to know him better.

The boy looked up from his sketchbook, startled by Elizabeth's sudden appearance. His golden eyes sparkled as he smiled, and Elizabeth's heart skipped a beat. ""I'm James,"" he said, his voice smooth and gentle. ""And thank you, I'm glad you like the drawing.""

Elizabeth's eyes returned to the sketchbook, and she couldn't help but feel a sense of admiration for James's talent. ""You're incredibly skilled,"" she said, her voice filled with sincerity. ""I love how you've captured the light and shadows in the garden. It's like I'm right there.""

James chuckled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. ""Thank you, Elizabeth. I'm glad you appreciate my art. I've been drawing for as long as I can remember.""

As they talked, Elizabeth found herself opening up to James in ways she never had with anyone before. She shared her passion for art, her fears, and her dreams. James listened intently, his expression empathetic and understanding.

""I know exactly what you mean,"" James said, his voice low and soothing. ""Sometimes, art feels like the only way to express what's inside me. I'm sure your parents would be supportive if they knew how much it means to you.""

Elizabeth smiled wistfully. ""I wish that were true. But for now, let's just keep this between us, okay?""

James nodded, his smile conspiratorial. ""Of course, your secret's safe with me, Elizabeth.""

As they stood there, surrounded by the beauty of the garden, Elizabeth felt a connection with James that she couldn't quite explain. It was as if they shared a secret language, one that only they understood. ",1,1764845534.0,writers,2,1.0,False

So I finally launched my Sudoku app: **Sudoku: Daily Brain Workout**. - It’s free without ads.

The funny thing is, when I started creating this project, I had basically never solved a Sudoku puzzle before. I've tried maybe two or three times, but gave up really fast. I didn't create this because I am some kind of Sudoku expert, but for myself to learn.

Building it helped me to understand how Sudoku really works, and why certain techniques actually matter, and how people can solve tougher puzzles. And along the way, I went from “I have no idea what I’m doing” to “okay wow… this is actually really fun”.

So after hundreds of coffee cups, months and months of coding, tweaking, breaking things, fixing things, the app is finally live:

A short description of the app:

* **Daily Sudoku puzzles**, a new board every day - with leaderboard for all who beat the daily puzzle.
* Multiple modes: **Classic**, **Zen**, and **Hardcore.**
* Three different difficulty levels.
* **Explainable technique hints** that actually tells you why a specific technique works (Naked Single, Hidden Single, Naked Pair, Hidden Pair, Pointing Pairs, Box-Line Reductions, X-Wing, etc.)
* **Note mode**, auto-cleaning notes, mistake tracking, undo/redo
* Stats, streaks, and a modern, clean UI

There are still things I am going to add, more solving techniques and different modes. But I’m really excited (and honestly very nervous) to finally share it with actual real Sudoku players, instead of just my own debugging brain.

If anybody here downloads and tries the app, I would love all type of feedback, both good and bad.

A couple of years ago my wife and I were traveling in Thailand, and Splitwise suddenly didn't allow more than 2 expenses per day for free. We tried alternatives but nothing really convinced us. So we built Splital, our own app!

**Splital has most features for free with no ads**. We decided to self-fund everything, so without investors, we are free to do what we think is best for our users. To support our work, we have a subscription around €14.99/year (the exact price depends on the country).

Splital currently has 1k+ ratings on Android, and 300+ ratings on iOS with a **global average rating of 4.8/5**

**What we did since the last post in November:**

* Enable/Disable Debt Simplification: With the new update you now have more control over your money, and can disable the simplify debts if you don’t find it useful
* Improved Stats: we've revamped our statistics feature with more granularity. It’s now possible to check details regarding each single member, category and subcategory of expenses. This allows to get an instant understanding of where the money went.
* Added notes to settle ups

So to recap, this is what we offer:

**Free Features:**

* Login is optional to respect your privacy
* Add expenses with no limits
* Creates groups with no limits
* Split expenses equally, by percentage, or exact amounts
* Enable/Disable simplify debts
* Add notes to expenses and settle ups
* Save and reuse your preferred split automatically
* Automatic expense categorisation
* Search expenses
* 150+ currencies
* Notifications

**Pro Features:**

* Attach images to expenses
* Export expenses as PDF/CSV
* Check charts and insights about your spending habits

As always, I’d love to hear your feedback and hope Splital can be helpful for you too!

1pdx0dp,https://www.reddit.com/r/romancenovels/comments/1pdx0dp/the_price_of_betrayal/,The price of betrayal,"Kylee shouldn't have believed her husband's lies-he and his assistant did not have an affair.
Grunts and the sounds of flesh slapping on flesh filled the hallway outside the office door. 
One of them was Jake’s.
The other…..female voice!!! 
She frzoe.
She watched from the door that was cracked open. She saw Jake’s hands were on Rachel’s hips, his fingers digging into her soft flesh as he was punding into her with a rhythm that was both urgent and desperate. 
Rachel's head was thrown back, her mouth open in a silent cry, her eyes squeezed shut as she rode the wave of pleasure that threatened to consume her. 
The air was thick with the sounds of their passion.
Bang!!! The sound of a coffee cup hitting the ground, the ceramic shattering into a thousand pieces.
Kylee, her eyes wide with shock, her face pale as she took in the scene before her.
Jake's eyes met Kylee's, and in that moment, a thousand unspoken words passed between them. 
Words of shock, of betrayal, and guilt.
————————

Kylee hadn’t felt like this in a long time. There was a lightness to her that morning, a quiet confidence humming beneath her skin. Her reflection in the mirror didn’t look tired or invisible. She saw warmth in her eyes, a subtle glow in her cheeks, the delicate curve of her lips turned up just slightly. She wasn’t just someone's mother today. Or someone's wife. She was her again.
Jake had intercourse to again her last night. He bang her like he remembered who she was. He showed up at the game, told her she was beautiful, and looked at her the way he used to before the years piled between them. For the first time in months, she hadn’t had to go into the draw and grab her vibrator to make herself cumming.  He held her after, pecked her shoulder like it still meant something.
The morning had started with chaos, as usual bottles, waffles, juice spills, Macy’s refusal to wear socks but it didn’t weigh her down the way it usually did. She floated through it, humming along with the radio, hair in a towel, a spark in her chest.
Just after lunch, she called the sitter. Lillian from down the street who came with glowing reviews and a calm presence even Kayla responded to.
“Can you come by for a few hours this afternoon?” Kylee asked. “I just need a little time to myself and I want to surprise Jake at work and go to dinner together.”
“Of course!”  Lillian responded. “Stay out as late as you need, I have the kids under control”!
She hadn’t said those words in so long, they felt foreign in her mouth.
By 2:30, the sitter had arrived, and Kylee was dressed in her favorite high-waisted jeans and a soft cream turtleneck that hugged her curves just right. She spritzed on her expensive perfume, the one she used to wear when Jake couldn’t keep his hands off her and added a swipe of deep berry lip gloss to finish.
She went to the salon before going to the clinic to get her nails and hair done.Her stylist curled her long, dark hair into soft, glossy waves. Her nails, newly shaped and painted a deep wine red, made her feel dangerous in the best way. She felt beautiful, and more than that she felt awake.
Rachel had shown up to work looking like she wasn’t just ready to check in patients, she was ready to be the reason every man in the building forgot their professionalism.
Her black, skin-tight dress clung to her body like it had been painted on. Sleeveless, low-cut, and stopping well above her knees. It hugged every curve, showing off her perfectly fake Double D breasts, and cinched perfectly at her waist. She paired it with tall black boots and a confident smirk that said she knew exactly what she was doing.
Jake noticed the moment she walked in the door.She bent over the receptionist desk to put her things down. Her butt were poking out the bottom of her dress. He tried not to stare at her but he just couldn’t help it. His mouth went dry instantly and he felt a rush of blood go through his body.
“I figured I’d dress up today,” she said sweetly, eyes glittering as they traveled down his torso. “Don’t all hard working surgeons deserve a little something charming to look at?”
Jake cleared his throat and looked away, but the way his jaw tightened said he’d heard every word. “This is a clinic, Rachel. Not a nightclub.”
She laughed, flipping her hair over one shoulder. “Yeah, but you work so hard. Might as well make your view a little more fun.”
He shook his head, smirking despite himself, and turned back toward his office. But her voice followed him.
“Oh and,” she called, voice light and teasing. “I canceled your 3:30 and 4:15. Told them the doctor needed some time to relax. You’ve been working sooo hard, Dr. Waterman.”
He stopped in the doorway. He turned to look at her.“You canceled my appointments?”
Rachel walked toward him, hips swaying, the black dress hugging her every step. “I did. You’ve taken care of everyone else all week. Thought maybe someone should take care of you for once.”
She stepped into his office, not waiting for permission, the click of her boots echoing in the hallway behind her. She perched herself on the edge of his desk, one leg crossing over the other slowly, deliberately.
Jake stared at her for a long moment.He should’ve told her to leave. To pull herself together. To stop playing these games.
But he didn’t.
Because some part of him didn’t want to.
When Rachel leaned forward and said, “Unless you’d rather I go,” her voice dipped into something low charming.
And Jake didn’t answer.
He didn’t have to.
Rachel had been flirting since the moment she got hired.
She wore that black, skin-tight dress like it was sewn onto her. Every time she moved, it clung to her body like a second skin. She leaned too far forward when she handed him things, let her fingers drag against his, and stood too close to him in the hallway. Always smiling. Always watching him.
Jake tried to maintain boundaries at least, at first. But it had been building for weeks. The way she lit up when he spoke to her. 
How she laughed at everything he said. How she called him Dr. W with a tone that was just shy of innocent.
.....
By lunch, Rachel leaned into the counter and said, voice soft and charming, “You know, if you ever needed... Some stress relief... I’m great at that.”
He didn’t say anything.But he didn’t shut it down either.
Just after 1:00 p.m., Rachel peeked her head into his office with a wicked little smile.“Your wife called. Wanted to bring you coffee later,” she said casually, twirling a pen between her fingers. “Said she was getting her hair and nails done.”
Jake hesitated, something in his chest tightening.
Rachel smiled wider. “Want me to call her back and tell her you’ve been slammed? That we had to squeeze in another last-minute surgery?”
He looked up at her.
She added quickly, “Only if you want me to.”
He didn’t nod. He didn’t speak. But he didn’t stop her either.
Rachel reached for the phone. A few moments later Kylee’s phone rang. Kylee answered on the second ring, sitting in her car outside the salon with two coffees in her cup holder and a soft smile on her face.
“Hey, this is Rachel, Dr. Waterman receptionist. I just wanted to let you know he asked me to call you. We had to add a late surgery this afternoon. Looks like he’s going to be slammed.”
Kylee paused, confused. “Oh... okay. I was going to bring him a coffee.”
Rachel let out a sweet little laugh. “Aww, that’s so thoughtful. I’ll let him know you were thinking of him. But yeah, he’s totally tied up in the OR. You know how he gets all focused and serious.”
Kylee smiled weakly. “Right. No worries.”
As Rachel hung up, she spun the phone in her hand and glanced back toward Jake’s office.
The clinic was quiet now, a quiet that thickened the air.
Jake sat at his desk, tablet still opened but he didn’t read a single word in minutes. His mind was already going places it shouldn’t.
Rachel slowly opened his office door and she shut the door behind her slowly, her lips curved into a knowing smile. The black dress was so charming on her. She didn’t belong in a medical office like that, and she didn’t care.
She crossed the room with unhurried confidence, each step deliberate, measured, like she knew the power she carried between her legs.
“You’ve been tense all day,” she said, voice low and velvet-soft. “I can see it in your shoulders.”
He looked at her, jaw tight. “You should head out. We're done for the day.”
Rachel ignored him. She circled his desk slowly, fingertips grazing the surface, nails softly tapping. “You’re always the one taking care of people,” she murmured. “Patients. Staff. Your wife…”Her voice dipped as she reached his chair, standing behind him now. “But who takes care of you, Dr. Waterman?”
He gripped the arms of his chair, but he didn’t move. She leaned down, her breath hot against his neck.
“I think about you all the time when I’m alone at night,” she whispered, lips close to his ear. “About what those hands could do if you weren’t holding a scalpel.”
He stiffened, still frozen, still not stopping her.
Rachel slipped one hand over his shoulder, slow and deliberate, sliding down the front of his shirt, her fingers brushing the buttons, grazing his chest.
“Just say the word, Let me take care of you.” She moved in front of him now, standing between his knees. Her eyes locked onto his, hands resting gently on his thighs.
“You want this,” she whispered. “I can feel it. you have been screwing me with your eyes for weeks”
Jake’s pulse hammered in his throat.
He should have pushed her away. He should have stood up and left the room. But he didn't, he just let her go on.
Rachel sank slowly to her knees her lips brushed the inside of his thighs. Slow, unhurried, like she wanted him to feel every breath, every brush of skin. Her nails slid along his belt, teasing, playing with the edge, like a cat toying with its prey.
Rachel didn’t want to talk about bills or dinner or teething. She didn’t care if he forgot to take out the trash. She didn’t see a husband, or a father, just a man. And right now, he needed that.
She looked up at him, her mouth parted, her eyes daring him to stop her. He didn’t. Instead, he leaned back and let his hands fall to her shoulders, his grip tightening as her peckings moved higher up his thigh, her touch more deliberate now, and more hungry.
He clenched his jaw, trying not to moan as her hands slowly grabbed his rock hard shaft. Rachel then put his shaft inside her mouth. Jake couldn’t control himself anymore. He left out a soft moan. “That’s it Dr.W show me you want me to continue.” That’s all he needed to hear. He grabbed the back of her hair and pushed her head up and down on his rock hard shaft.
“You are a very bad girl Rachel. Very charming but bad” Rachel moaned while sucking his shaft.  Jake felt like a king. Kylee didn’t ever want to suck his shaft.
Rachel stood up and Jake picked her up and ripped her dress off. Rachel moaned out loud “Dr.W you deserve to cumming harder than you ever came before”
He looked at Rachel with a sweaty face “You call me Dr.Waterman” as he grabbed her by the face and started pecking her.
Jake then shoved his shaft into Rachel’s tight wet cherry and she let out loud moans, He never got these types of moans from Kylee. “HARDER!” Rachel screamed.
Rachel rocked against him. She pecked down his throat, screamed his name in a voice that curled around him like silk, and he couldn’t remember the last time someone said it like that.
“Screw, Rachel,” he muttered, his voice hoarse with need. “You’re going to make me cumming.” Jake finished in Rachel’s mouth. She sat up and looked at him in the sexiest way as she wiped his seeds from the side of her mouth. “That’s how you get taken care of and release stress Dr.W”
Jake moved quickly, suddenly hyperaware of everything: the clock on the wall, the tightening of his chest, the lingering scent of intercourse in the air. He adjusted his shirt with trembling fingers, buttoning it fast, running a damp hand through his hair to smooth it back into place. His pulse was still erratic, but his mind had already leapt ahead to home, to Kylee, to dinner, to anything that might anchor him back to the life he’d just stepped out of.
.....
The warm scent of espresso and vanilla filled the tiny shop. She ordered his usual dark roast, extra oat milk, 7 raw sugars and a tea for herself.
By the time she stepped back into the cold air, cups in hand, her heart was hammering.
She hoped he’d be surprised. She hoped he’d be happy. Mostly, she hoped this would calm whatever fear was screaming just beneath her skin.
The clinic was just ten minutes away now. A straight shot down the road. Kylee had never felt less sure of where she was going.
She sat in the parking lot for a moment, the two coffees warming her hands, her eyes fixed on the door. Her heart beat faster than she wanted to admit.
You’re just dropping something off, she told herself again. You’re his wife. This is normal. And it should’ve been. But something didn’t feel normal.
She glanced at herself in the rearview mirror, hair freshly done, a bit of gloss on her lips, cheeks still holding a soft flush. She looked good. She wanted to believe that would matter.
Taking a deep breath, Kylee stepped out of the car, clutching the drink tray carefully. The air was brisk, her boots tapping softly as she made her way to the side entrance. She had the door code of course she did and punched it in without hesitation.
The hallway smelled faintly of antiseptic. The walls were calm, painted a muted gray with framed before-and-after photos lining the corridor. Everything was quiet. Too quiet for early afternoon.
The reception desk was empty.
No Rachel.
No patients in the waiting room.
She heard voices that weren't professional.
One of them was Jake’s.
The other…..
She didn’t want to name it yet.
The coffee cups trembled slightly in her hand.
She took a step closer. And then another.
Down the hall. Past the supply closet. Around the corner toward his private office the door was cracked open.
Kylee reached out with her free hand, fingers brushing the wood grain.
Inside, she heard movement.
She watched from the door that was cracked open. She saw Jake’s hands were on Rachel’s hips, his fingers digging into her soft flesh as he was punding into her with a rhythm that was both urgent and desperate.

1pdwyzc,https://www.reddit.com/r/DeepThoughts/comments/1pdwyzc/if_we_used_the_internet_for_its_original_purpose/,If we used the internet for its original purpose we could make every natural resource free and save humanity,"Ive been thinking a lot. Seeing all the signs like you have im sure.
Trying to stay off my phone but man its so easy to just pick up and become a zombie.

The thing that once brought us closer than ever (you can literally chat with anyone who wishes to have an online profile of any sort)
Has now been the thing that drives us even further apart.

Together we survived and together we survive.

You can feel distant at times but you know that no matter what if you’re lonely or lost you can turn to the internet and immediately get what you’re looking for.
Isnt that absolutely amazing?
Maybe its not a way to get something material like a truck instantly, but hey. You can probably figure out getting one right?

Or do you still believe you cant?
Why is it, that you get it, and no one else does?
Why is it that we are so connected yet disconnected?

I think this is it. This is the connection.
You read these words as I typed them. The way my consciousness spoke them, the way yours speaks them now so fluently.

So many people want to be free but they don’t know what that means.
Its not ""freedom at a cost""
Its freedom is a choice. However free you want to be is how free you will be.
You just like everyone else are entirely responsible for everything you do.

I noticed with certain popular people giving away millions in cars cash houses etc.. that more and more people are starting to do these giveaways..
I myself have even won a car and cash worth $70k

Finally we have started to stitch things back together but it wont be overnight.
I have been fighting constantly wanting change but I know that we are living it.
This marks what we will teach kids about.

Standard studies don’t work well anymore. The internet has everything you could need to know and then some.
But too much internet isnt great. We need a healthy life balance and for our people and children to live an actual life.

If your business model cant survive on a free basis then its probably not a good one.. realistically we all just consume consume consume and its going to ruin us.
We do not need five coffee chain stores all in 1 minute of each other. If we did then its because the need for coffee is that high right?

Some people want to sit at home and play video games all day. They love it, they can do it for their whole lives. I bet if they were immortal some would even do it 99% of their time that you know them.

That just drives so many people up the walls. And its funny because when you ask why, not a single answer will be acceptable.

Just as you are free to think and feel, so are others. Some people wish to do more and some people wish to do way less and that’s okay.
We are a very small planet with a population that will soon plateau and we will be gone in the blink of an eye.
We need to start doing better.

I would love to take the bus to a train station where I then head towards the coast and hop on a mag train across the ocean to watch a peaceful sunrise over a snowy mountain. And head home right after.
There might have been people there might have been not a single soul in those 15 hours of travel.

We as a people are entirely capable of working together to improve everything for everyone.
Why should things get safer and then its not mandatory to upgrade everyone for free?

I know you can ask tons of questions and I promise they’re all mundane.
We are capable of solving every problem that faces us and some people hate the idea of supporting those that don’t wish to support themselves but sometimes im tired too man.

But everyday I wish to help others regardless if I can or not and I know im not alone.
We can have systems set up to start getting real projects done that move humanity forward and its literally in our hands.

To start this process of a free society wont be easy. In fact it took the past 2000 plus or minus years to get to this point but we can do it.

And to do that I say we start doing things for the better of humanity regardless of if you can get a tax write off or not.
We are no longer strangers separated by oceans. We are people that are only separated by barriers we decide to pass or not.
We are one earth with the people who love and dream just like you.

This one earth we have is way smaller than most can realize but im tired of for profits selling to us that kids are starving in Africa.
What I know is that they make life work and they do it together as a people. As neighbors do.

With free natural resources we can start making so many things affordable again. There are already so many oil rigs and other equipment and machinery out there that if we need something we can get it.

I don’t appreciate the mentality of its stealing off someones plate because honestly if they needed it then that’s okay. Greed is what will destroy our society and to reach a free society of absolutely no money or currencies sounds impossible but it is not.
We have the people, im sure theres millions if not billions waiting to push through.



TLDR:
Who cares if you wanna drink beer all day and do drugs, so many others wanna do anything but that.
But that doesnt mean anyone deserves more or less.

If I were immortal I would get bored a lot but at least any struggle I had would be my own

We don’t need currency so to start that we need to give more and more stuff away for free and eventually everything would be free but we can still trade and be intelligent beings

You are living the greatest turning point in all of our species kind and possibly the first truly working ""socialist"" society.
I call it SoCalysm.
Had to have capitalism to achieve real socialism.

We can be more efficient together

So I’ve been seeing this guy for about 5 months now and it’s been brilliant for the most part. I don’t think I’ve ever connected with someone like I have with him and he said the same for me.

He’s very easygoing and we laugh a lot together, he’s also very affectionate and interesting as a person.

However (and there’s always a however isn’t there), although our sex life started off great, it hasn’t been as frequent or intimate or reciprocal in the past couple of months. For example, I can only orgasm through external stimulation if you catch my drift, and I have had ex partners do this with me so I hit the big O. This guy knows this and would put effort into this at the beginning, but now, he doesn’t even offer. He doesn’t go down.

Ive found it a bit frustrating, considering I do it for him every time we are intimate, and at this point he expects it. Fine with me, I enjoy it, but he doesn’t return, the thought doesn’t even cross his mind.

Anyway, because all other aspects have been great I didn’t think it was a big deal.

THEN, about a month ago he started getting the giggles when I would go down on him, he said funny stuff would just pop into his head or because he knew he shouldn’t be laughing, that made him laugh in itself. Which I do kind of get. So there’s been quite a few times he’s initiated, I’ve then gone down and then he’s got the giggles and we’ve stopped. It was a little annoying and I did feel like it impacted my confidence a little bit, but I was understanding and would try to laugh it off. Sometimes it was just ridiculous and I’d end up laughing too.

Well, last night we were getting intimate and he said he was quite tired and had to go sleep because of an early morning at work, that’s fine. So we stopped. About an hour later he initiated and we started having sex, and I heard him laugh with his face in the pillow, while we’re having sex. I was so confused, I asked him what’s up and he just kept saying nothing. Kept going, and then laughed in my face. He said he was thinking about something his friend sent him… while we’re having sex?

I felt like it was a step too far and it hasn’t made me feel good at all. I was really into it, and to know he was thinking about his friend in that moment just made me feel like shit. From his side it clearly wasn’t intimate at all and I really didn’t appreciate it.

I’d be fine if he laughed during sex because he found something in that moment funny etc, but to know that what I thought was an intimate moment, he’s thinking about his friend sending him funny messages?

It is a shame because we get on really well, and I am an easygoing person, but for me this has affected my confidence, and the way I feel about the intimacy side of our relationship. Would I be overreacting if I end things over this?

For context, after this he stopped, he apologised and asked me if I’m upset. He then went to sleep. This morning he woke up, made me a coffee and gave me cuddles and then went to work. He’s messaged me since being nice and all, but I’m in two minds.",4,1764845264.0,relationships,31,0.63,False

Not in this world of neon halos,  
flickering billboards,  
and people living too fast to feel.  
He was just a boy with tired eyes  
and a heartbeat that belonged to someone else.

She found him on a rooftop,  
sitting on the edge like he was negotiating with gravity.  
He wasn’t planning to jump.  
He was just trying to figure out  
why the world felt so heavy  
and why he still stayed.

She sat beside him without asking.  
Two strangers.  
One universe.  
And somehow the silence between them  
felt like the first real thing  
either had touched in years.

They didn’t fall in love.  
They crashed into it  
messy, reckless,  
like two meteors on a collision course  
who both knew  
the impact would ruin them  
and still didn’t slow down.

Their dates weren’t soft.  
They were neon-lit nights  
where the streets reflected like broken mirrors,  
where he told her about the ghosts in his chest  
and she traced constellations on his wrist  
like she could rewrite his past.

Love in their world wasn’t romantic.  
It was survival.  
It was choosing one person  
in a city full of noise,  
full of strangers,  
full of people pretending they didn’t break for fun.

But tragedy doesn’t need permission.  
It just needs a moment.

For them, it came at 3:17 AM  
in a hospital waiting room  
smelling like cheap coffee and electricity.  
The kind of night where hope  
is just another fluorescent light  
flickering overhead.

She didn’t leave.  
She couldn’t.  
Not when Hao was fighting  
a battle he never told her about:  
the kind that doesn’t show up on x-rays,  
the kind that lives in the soft cracks  
between “I’m fine”  
and “I’m falling apart.”

He held her hand like a secret,  
like a prayer whispered too late.

“Promise me,” he said,  
voice rough,  
eyes brighter than the monitors beside him,  
“that you’ll remember me  
not as I am now,  
but as who I tried to be  
when I was with you.”

And she broke  
quietly,  
beautifully,  
like glass learning how to breathe again.

Hao didn’t die that night.  
But something else did:  
their version of forever.

Because fate in the modern world  
doesn’t take lives  
it takes *timing.*

Now she walks the same streets alone,  
passing the same lights,  
seeing the same shadows,  
and every now and then  
she swears she hears his voice in the crowd,  
soft as a memory:

“In another life,  
in a slower world,  
I would’ve stayed.”

And maybe he would’ve.  
But this world was too fast,  
too bright,  
too loud  
for a love like theirs.

Some people are born for tragedy.  
Some for legend.  
Hao was both.  
And she will love him  
for the rest of her life  
in every universe  
where they almost had a chance.",1,1764845164.0,u_Cultural-Ad7385,0,1.0,False

I just bought a delonghi rivelia… very happy overall!

But I have a question: Every time I start and turn off the machine, apart from the water that comes out of the coffee spout, water falls into the grounds drawer, little, but it falls.
The photo is of the freshly cleaned drawer, then I turned the machine on and off and this is the water that falls.

I think it's normal! But the experts help me!!!

In general very happy, but with that doubt!!

I felt a cold coming on and mindlessly took two DayQuil tablets about an hour after my meds. And I had had 2 cups of coffee. 

Well, about 90 minutes later I was clammy, heart racing, shaking, muscles tightening, slightly blurred vision, dry mouth, cold sensations on my extremities but sweaty palms, and nausea. Heart rate shot up to 126bpm.

I realized that I am likely having some effects of serotonin syndrome, which of course increased my anxiety and made me feel even worse. 

After a little research I discovered that Benzos are usually what would be given in hospital so I took .25mg of Xanax. It helped and I’m starting to relax a bit, but damn I really thought I was going to have to call emergency services for a bit there.

TLDR: Do not mix cold medicine with Vyvanse or bupropion. You will regret it and may end up in the ER!",3,1764844633.0,VyvanseADHD,3,1.0,False

1pdwnxi,https://www.reddit.com/r/chinatravel/comments/1pdwnxi/trying_to_balance_traveling_and_writing_as_a_solo/,Trying to balance “traveling” and “writing” as a solo traveler is… interesting,"So I took myself on a small solo trip to Sanya Bay, Hainan last week because I thought a change of scenery would magically turn me into a super-productive writer. You know, the kind who wakes up early, drinks a cute coffee, and writes 2,000 words by noon.

Reality: I wrote… maybe 200 words? Over three days?  
But honestly, I’m not even mad about it.

I stayed in one of the big beachfront resorts along Sanya Bay, the Mangrove Tree Resort World Sanya Bay cluster (it’s huge, has its own ecosystem). I’d planned to use the balcony as my “writing office,” but every time I sat down, something distracted me. First it was the weather, then it was people doing morning exercise on the promenade, then it was literally just me zoning out.

But traveling alone does something to your brain in a good way. I ended up journaling a lot, not polished stuff, just thoughts, small observations, random lines that probably won’t make it into any actual blog post… but felt good to write down anyway. Sometimes I think solo travel is less about seeing things and more about finally hearing your own thoughts without interruption.

I’m curious, for those of you who write while traveling:  
Do you have a routine, or do you just accept that travel writing is mostly “notes first, real writing later”?  
I keep telling myself I’ll figure out a system, but maybe this is the system.

Would love to hear how other people handle it!",0,1764844201.0,chinatravel,0,0.5,False
