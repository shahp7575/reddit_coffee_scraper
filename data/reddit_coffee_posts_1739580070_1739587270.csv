1iprp37,https://www.reddit.com/r/PuertoRicoTravel/comments/1iprp37/trip_report_janfeb_2025_vieques_fajardoluquillo/,"Trip Report Jan/Feb 2025 - Vieques, Fajardo/Luquillo, Ponce","I was in Puerto Rico from January 27 to February 6 with my husband. We are in our 30s and enjoy doing active, outdoorsy things. We went to Vieques, Fajardo/Luquillo, and Ponce. Here are my recommendations and tips:

**Vieques - What To Do**

* **Mosquito Pier** - Great snorkeling. There is a ladder into the water near a tree on the left as you drive in. The underwater supports are spooky and I didn't want to spend too much time under the pier as the water was a bit rough, but I still saw tons of cool stuff, including a turtle. [This video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3pCN29Mw890) shows what it's like; if you find the video itself too unsettling I'd avoid it. You can still see lots of cool fish if you swim around the pier and don't go under it, though my husband is a confident swimmer and dove downwards and apparently saw even more good stuff.
* **Playa Punta Arenas** - We went here two days in a row; day one was insanely good and day two was just okay. Husband saw a spotted eagle ray, and I saw a nurse shark (!!!), a turtle, a huge pufferfish, and a small barracuda. Of course there were tons of other fish, sea urchins, etc. as well. The expanse of shallow, calm water and ease of entry makes this a good option to take kids snorkeling though it gets pretty deep farther out. The sand fleas on the shore were pretty bad even at like 1 pm but we came here to snorkel so we dealt with it. The road to the beach was manageable with a golf cart if you are a confident/experienced driver, but otherwise take a rental car as there are a ridiculous number of potholes. I saw people say you absolutely need a Jeep, which if you are a good driver is not true. Just be careful. [I made this graphic](https://i.imgur.com/2EgRVm9.png) to show where to go. NOTE: There is a strong northward current so I recommend starting at the bottom and letting it take you up, then head towards the beach and walk back south (or swim closer to shore).
* **Playa La Chiva** - This beach is part of the NWR and the road is also incredibly full of potholes, so same note as above applies. We swam out to the west side of the bigger cay which I'd heard was good; we saw some stuff but it wasn't really worth it at the time and it got way too rough the farther out we got. I did see a 1 meter long sea cucumber, though. The water is shallow even very far out so it's pleasant to hang out and swim in. We stopped at parking spot #8 or so. I have heard the end towards Punta Conejo is good for snorkeling‚Äîmaybe next time.
* **Cayo de Tierra** - This was a very cool little hike; you walk across a land bridge to the cay, then enter the forest and take a trail that leads to a cliff where you can sit and overlook the bay (we even saw a stingray way down in the water). The cliff and hike are not recommended for younger kids as the cliff itself is smallish and would be only too easy to fall off of. There was a brief steep portion but I didn't think the hike was that bad. The trail is not clearly marked and parts are a bit overgrown. However, I think it'd be hard to actually get lost because it's a small area. [I found this map](https://i.imgur.com/zfqtyBD.jpeg) really helpful; the little spur at the bottom to the east is where the cliff was. Maybe it'd be a good sunrise hike!
* **Bio Bay Tour** - I'd never done this so it was a must do, of course. We went the day after the new moon and the stars mirrored the dinoflagellates in the bay. I had a great time and it's obviously a very unique experience, though my husband got to do the tour back when they'd let you swim in the bay so he wasn't as impressed lol. The clear kayaks were awesome and the little guys were like stars, not quite the blue glow they show up as in photos.

**Vieques - Food**

* **Pescader√≠a Angelyz** - Fish market with friendly folks (and tarpon who hang around in the water for scraps) where we got a fresh 2 lb red snapper for $9. Highly recommend coming here if you plan to cook during your stay.
* **Supermercado Morales** - After some trial and error we figured out that this place had superior products and prices (though next time we will do our groceries before hopping on the ferry).
* **Casa Nativo** - Delicious Puerto Rican dishes. We ordered a bunch of appetizers as tapas and enjoyed it immensely. 
* **Smashburger** - My husband was delighted with his chicken sandwich from here!
* **Rising Roost** - Very good food after a bit of a wait, but I think they were understaffed because service was very slow (not the waiters' fault). I would still definitely recommend them but maybe not if you have somewhere to be soon after.

**Vieques - Transportation**

Ceiba ferry - Our ride to Vieques was delayed but you can't beat the price. We parked our rental car for several days in the lot and there was a free shuttle to/from the lot and the ferry. The sign said you could get do monthly parking for $50 (one day was $15) but I think maybe you have to ask for that (?) because we didn't get it automatically applied and ended up paying $75. Slightly disappointing but oh well.

We got a golf cart to go around the island but we would not do it again. We felt safe going around in a golf cart on Culebra but Vieques has bigger/faster roads and even though we are experienced drivers we didn't feel good about driving the golf cart at night (it didn't help that the thing was a piece of crap lol). We ended up taking taxis at night and to/from the golf cart rental place so in the end, we actually would have saved money if we'd just rented a car instead of a golf cart.

The taxi situation can be pretty infuriating and I would NOT recommend it unless you truly cannot drive and don't have any appointments. We found a good taxi company but at peak time (Thursday night) they told us they could not get us a ride. I was terrified that we'd miss our bio bay tour even though I started looking for a taxi 45 minutes ahead of time. We asked around and got the numbers of random ""taxi drivers"". One of them came through for us, but when we asked him to take us back after the tour, he said he was coming and then proceeded to no show. We waited an hour for him because we didn't want to screw him if he'd already left his house, but he screwed us. We eventually used the 741 taxi app to find someone else and got home 2 hours later. The price to go from Esperanza to Isabel (a 15 minute drive) at night was $38 on this app. üòë

Bottom line: just rent a car. Even if someone says they can recommend some guys, I really don't want to deal with calling random dudes who may or may not show up. The 741 app works well but doesn't have enough drivers.

**Fajardo - What To Do**

* **Seven Seas Beach** - This is a perfectly nice beach, though it was a little cold (maybe because it's on the Atlantic side?) I didn't try snorkeling, but there was a peaceful and pretty nature trail where I saw a hermit crab the size of a grapefruit. The main gate might be closed but if you walk along the beach you can get onto the road where you will eventually see a trailhead. The Costa M√≠a Restaurant was reasonably priced and had tasty snacks and drinks.
* **El Yunque** - Always solid. We parked our car at spots that looked interesting and wandered around. We'd already done the Mt Britton trail on a previous trip so we took it easy and just enjoyed spending time in the rainforest. Right now you do not need to get a ticket ahead of time.
* **[River Cave Swimming Adventure](https://www.tripadvisor.com/AttractionProductReview-g2665727-d32764385-River_Cave_Swimming_Adventure_at_Vega_Baja_Puerto_Rico-Isla_Verde_Carolina_Puerto.html)** - Not in Fajardo, but it's what we did on one day. We had a wonderful time with Elliott and Cathy. They picked us up at our Airbnb in a rural location (which I was not expecting, very good service!) and took us to a series of caves they'd scoped out where you could swim. They are extremely knowledgeable about the area and very kind; if you have little kids or group members who aren't strong swimmers I would still feel confident going with them. We'd always wanted to explore caves in PR but it's the kind of thing where it's better to go with someone not only for safety but because they know where exactly to go. If you've ever wanted to do this activity, I'd recommend them!

**Ponce - Food**

* **Cafe Lucero** - Seriously delicious coffee (they have their own coffee farm and roaster) and a good menu. Definitely recommend stopping here for a meal. If you're interested in women's clothing there's a nice little shop, Palu Boutique, around the corner.
* **El Negocio de Panchi** - This is straight up a super high end fine dining experience for a fraction of the price in a cozy little restaurant. Insanely good food, great service, and Mr Panchi himself came and chatted with us. It wasn't crowded when we went but we made a reservation just to be safe.

NOTE: Please use Waze in Puerto Rico. Google Maps is flawed and does not reliably factor in traffic. It told us it would take an hour less from Ponce to San Juan than it really did, and if we hadn't checked Waze we might have missed our flight.

WHAT I ATE - Virginia  
@ World of Waffles  
Woodbridge, VA



Just having a late morning breakfast.  My wife ordered the Chicken and Waffles which are terrific here!  Remember to order the Fried Chicken and NOT the Chicken Tenders!  I think the chicken on the bone is more flavorful and you get both white and dark meat.  But if you don't mind boneless chicken breast, that's OK too.

I ordered the Fried Pork Chops with Eggs and Potatoes, which were good.  But after trying a piece of the chicken, I knew what I would order here next!

Of curse the waffles are what you come here for.  Big, crispy, buttery, eggy and tender on the inside.  Get them wth pecans or topped with strawberries.  Yum!

If you're here on the weekend before church lets out, seating is very quick.  The staff are mindful and frequently check on you to refill coffee and see how everything is going.

Would love to come by here for dinner after work, BUT THEY ARE NOT OPEN FOR DINNER.  As they close at 3PM.  So, keep in mind, this is a breakfast and lunch place.

Close to DC, there is lots of parking in the back and they are easy to get to, off the I-95 corridor.

Removing Wine Stains from Upholstery: Immediate Steps to Take
-------------------------------------------------------------

When you spill wine on your upholstery, quick action can make all the difference in saving your furniture. Here‚Äôs a step-by-step guide to help you remove wine stains effectively and efficiently.

### Immediate Action

As soon as the spill happens, grab some clean, dry paper towels.¬†**Gently blot the stain**¬†to absorb as much wine as possible. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread the wine deeper into the fabric. Blotting is key to lifting the wine without pushing it further into the upholstery.

### Prepare Your Cleaning Solution

While blotting, prepare a cleaning solution. Mix one tablespoon of dish soap with two cups of warm water. You can also add a tablespoon of white vinegar to enhance the cleaning power. Vinegar helps neutralize the acid in the wine, making it easier to remove the stain. Stir the mixture gently until the soap dissolves.

### Cleaning the Stain

Once you have your cleaning solution ready, dip a clean cloth into the mixture. Gently wring out the excess liquid so the cloth is damp, not soaking wet. Place the damp cloth over the stain and press down lightly to allow the cleaning solution to penetrate the fabric. Let it sit for a few minutes, then lift the cloth to see if the stain has lifted.

### Rinsing the Area

If the stain is still visible, rinse the area with a clean, damp cloth using only water. This step is crucial to remove any residue from the cleaning solution. Be careful not to oversaturate the upholstery; aim for a gentle, even dampness across the affected area.

### Drying the Upholstery

After rinsing, use clean, dry paper towels to blot the area again. Press down firmly to absorb as much moisture as possible. If the upholstery is thick or padded, you may want to place a heavy book or another flat weight on top to help absorb excess water. Allow the upholstery to air dry completely. Open windows or use a fan to speed up the drying process, but avoid direct sunlight, which can cause the fabric to fade.

### Using Baking Soda (Optional)

If the stain persists after drying, sprinkle baking soda over the affected area. Baking soda acts as a natural deodorizer and can help draw out stubborn stains. Let it sit for a few hours or overnight. Once the baking soda has absorbed the remaining odor and residue, vacuum it up thoroughly.

### Professional Help

In cases where the stain is particularly stubborn or the upholstery is delicate, consider seeking professional help. Professional cleaners have specialized equipment and solutions that can tackle tough stains without damaging the fabric. It‚Äôs worth the investment to preserve the beauty and longevity of your furniture.

### Preventive Measures

To prevent future spills from becoming permanent stains, keep a stain remover kit handy. These kits often contain pre-treatment solutions specifically designed for fabrics. Always test any cleaning product on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn‚Äôt damage the fabric.

### Regular Maintenance

Regular cleaning and maintenance can also help prevent wine stains from setting in. Vacuum your upholstery regularly to remove dirt and spills before they become problematic. Consider having your furniture professionally cleaned once a year to keep it looking its best.

### Final Tips

Remember, prompt action is key when dealing with wine stains. The longer the stain sits, the harder it becomes to remove. Keep a stash of cleaning supplies near areas where spills are common, like dining rooms or living rooms. With these steps, you can quickly address wine spills and maintain the pristine condition of your upholstery.

DIY Solutions: Natural Remedies for Wine Stains on Furniture
------------------------------------------------------------

When you're dealing with a wine spill on upholstery, quick action can make all the difference. Whether it's a casual dinner party gone wrong or a clumsy moment during a cozy evening, knowing how to tackle wine stains naturally can save your furniture from permanent damage. Here are some effective DIY solutions you can try right away.

### Natural Remedies for Wine Stains on Furniture

Before you reach for harsh chemicals, consider these gentle, natural remedies that can help remove wine stains from your upholstery:

#### Immediate Action

*   **Blot the stain:**¬†As soon as the spill happens, grab paper towels or a clean cloth and blot the stain gently. Avoid rubbing the stain, as this can spread the wine deeper into the fabric.
    
*   **Dilute with cold water:**¬†If the stain is still wet, use cold water to dilute the wine. Apply the water gently, and continue blotting until the excess liquid is absorbed.
    

#### Baking Soda and Vinegar Solution

A mixture of baking soda and vinegar can work wonders on wine stains. Here‚Äôs how to use it:

*   Mix one part white vinegar with two parts water in a spray bottle.
    
*   Spray the solution onto the stain and let it sit for about five minutes.
    
*   Blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb the liquid.
    
*   Sprinkle baking soda over the damp area and let it sit for another five minutes.
    
*   Once the baking soda has dried, vacuum it up.
    

#### Club Soda

Club soda is another effective remedy because of its carbonation and acidity, which can help lift the stain. Follow these steps:

*   Pour club soda directly onto the stain and let it sit for a few minutes.
    
*   Blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb the club soda and the stain.
    
*   Repeat the process until the stain is no longer visible.
    

#### Hydrogen Peroxide Solution

If the stain persists, hydrogen peroxide can be used as a more potent solution. However, test this method on an inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn‚Äôt discolor your upholstery:

*   Mix one part hydrogen peroxide with two parts water in a spray bottle.
    
*   Spray the solution onto the stain and let it sit for about 10 minutes.
    
*   Rinse the area with cold water and blot dry with a clean towel.
    

#### Enzyme Cleaner

For stubborn stains, an enzyme cleaner can be particularly effective. Enzymes break down the proteins in the wine, making them easier to remove:

*   Apply the enzyme cleaner according to the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions.
    
*   Let it sit for the recommended time, usually 15-30 minutes.
    
*   Blot the area with a clean cloth to absorb the cleaner.
    
*   Rinse with cold water and let it air dry.
    

#### Preventive Measures

To prevent future wine spills from becoming a nightmare, here are some preventive tips:

*   Use coasters under glasses to catch any drips or spills.
    
*   Keep a stain remover handy for quick cleanup.
    
*   Regularly clean your upholstery to keep it free from stains and odors.
    

#### Professional Help

Despite your best efforts, some stains might be too stubborn to remove. In such cases, professional upholstery cleaning services can offer a thorough and reliable solution. They have specialized equipment and products designed to tackle tough stains without damaging the fabric.

#### Final Tips

Remember, different fabrics may require different approaches. Always test any cleaning solution on a small, hidden area first to ensure it doesn‚Äôt cause any damage or discoloration. Additionally, act quickly when dealing with spills to increase the chances of successful stain removal.

With these natural remedies and preventive measures, you can handle wine stains on your upholstery effectively and efficiently. Enjoy your wine without worrying about the aftermath!

Professional Cleaning Products: Choosing the Right One for Your Upholstery
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining the beauty and longevity of your upholstery, choosing the right professional cleaning products is crucial. Whether you're dealing with stubborn stains or simply want to keep your furniture looking fresh, selecting the appropriate cleaner can make a significant difference. Here‚Äôs how to navigate the world of upholstery cleaners and ensure you pick the best one for your needs.

First, it's important to identify the type of fabric your upholstery is made of. Common materials include cotton, leather, microfiber, and velvet. Each fabric has different care requirements, so knowing what you‚Äôre working with is essential. For instance, cotton and microfiber are generally more forgiving and can handle a wider range of cleaning solutions compared to delicate fabrics like silk or velvet.

### Understanding Fabric Labels

Most upholstery comes with a label that indicates the recommended cleaning method. These labels are often found under cushions or along the edges of the furniture. They typically use codes such as¬†**S**,¬†**W**,¬†**SW**, or¬†**X**. An¬†**S**¬†code means the upholstery can be cleaned with water-free solvents, while a¬†**W**¬†code indicates that water-based cleaning solutions are safe.¬†**SW**¬†means both solvents and water can be used, and¬†**X**¬†suggests that only vacuuming is recommended. Always refer to these labels before choosing a cleaning product.

### Choosing the Right Cleaner

Once you know the fabric type and cleaning code, you can start selecting the appropriate cleaner. For general maintenance, look for products labeled as ""fabric protectors"" or ""stain repellents."" These can help prevent future stains and keep your upholstery looking new. If you have a specific stain to tackle, choose a cleaner designed for that type of stain. For example, oil-based stains may require a solvent-based cleaner, while water-based stains might need a water-based solution.

*   **Fabric Protectors:**¬†These are ideal for regular upkeep and can help repel spills and stains.
    
*   **Spot Cleaners:**¬†These are formulated to remove specific types of stains and are often available in spray bottles for easy application.
    
*   **Powdered Cleaners:**¬†These are great for deep cleaning and can be worked into the fabric with a soft brush before vacuuming.
    
*   **Steam Cleaners:**¬†These are powerful tools for deep cleaning and sanitizing upholstery. They work by using hot water vapor to loosen and remove dirt and grime.
    

### DIY vs. Professional Cleaners

While DIY cleaning solutions can be effective, professional cleaners often offer more thorough results. Professional-grade cleaners are designed to handle tough stains and can be more efficient at removing embedded dirt and odors. However, they can also be harsher on fabrics, so it‚Äôs important to follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions carefully.

If you opt for a DIY approach, consider making your own cleaning solution using common household items. For example, a mixture of dish soap and warm water can be effective for many types of stains. Just be sure to test the solution on a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure it doesn‚Äôt damage the fabric.

### Additional Tips for Upholstery Care

Beyond choosing the right cleaner, there are several other tips to keep your upholstery looking its best:

*   **Avoid Direct Sunlight:**¬†Prolonged exposure to sunlight can cause fabrics to fade. Consider using curtains or blinds to protect your upholstery from direct sunlight.
    
*   **Regular Vacuuming:**¬†Regularly vacuuming your upholstery can help remove dust and debris that can accumulate over time. Use attachments designed for upholstery to avoid damaging the fabric.
    
*   **Immediate Stain Removal:**¬†Promptly addressing spills and stains can prevent them from setting in. Blot the stain immediately with a clean cloth and apply a suitable cleaner as soon as possible.
    
*   **Professional Cleaning:**¬†Even with regular care, professional cleaning every year or two can help maintain the appearance and extend the life of your upholstery.
    

Choosing the right professional cleaning product for your upholstery involves understanding the fabric type, consulting the cleaning code, and selecting a cleaner that matches the specific needs of your furniture. By following these guidelines and incorporating regular maintenance practices, you can keep your upholstery looking fresh and vibrant for years to come.

Preventive Measures: How to Protect Your Furniture from Spills
--------------------------------------------------------------

Protecting your furniture from spills is essential for maintaining its appearance and longevity. Whether it's a luxurious leather sofa or a delicate fabric armchair, spills can leave lasting marks if not addressed promptly. Here are some effective preventive measures to safeguard your furniture from accidental spills.

### Choose the Right Fabrics

When selecting upholstery for your furniture, opt for materials that are easier to clean and more spill-resistant. For instance, microfiber and synthetic fabrics are great choices because they resist stains better than natural fibers like cotton or linen. Additionally, consider treating your upholstery with fabric protectors, which create a barrier against spills and stains.

#### Selecting Appropriate Upholstery Materials

Microfiber is particularly effective due to its tightly woven threads, which prevent liquids from penetrating deeply into the fabric. Similarly, synthetic blends often incorporate water-repellent properties, making them less likely to absorb spills. Always check the care label for cleaning instructions before purchasing.

##### Applying Fabric Protectors

Fabric protectors can be applied after purchase to enhance spill resistance. These products form a microscopic shield over the fabric, allowing spills to bead up and wipe away easily. Be sure to follow the manufacturer‚Äôs guidelines for application, as some protectors may require reapplication after a certain period.

### Place Protective Covers

Using protective covers can add an extra layer of defense against spills. These covers come in various styles and materials, designed to fit different types of furniture. They not only protect against spills but also help maintain the furniture‚Äôs appearance by shielding it from everyday wear and tear.

#### Types of Protective Covers

For sofas and chairs, consider slipcovers that can be easily removed for washing. For dining room chairs, seat covers offer a practical solution. Some covers are made from waterproof materials, providing additional protection against liquid spills.

##### Maintenance Tips for Protective Covers

Regularly clean protective covers according to the care instructions provided. This helps ensure they remain effective in preventing spills from reaching the upholstery underneath. It‚Äôs also wise to have a few extra covers on hand for quick replacements when one becomes soiled.

### Use Trays and Drink Holders

In areas where spills are most likely to occur, such as living rooms and family rooms, placing trays or drink holders can minimize the risk of accidents. These accessories provide designated spaces for drinks and snacks, reducing the likelihood of spills onto the furniture.

#### Strategic Placement of Trays and Drink Holders

Position trays on coffee tables, end tables, and side tables near seating areas. For larger gatherings, consider using coasters and placemats to further protect surfaces. These small additions can significantly reduce the chance of spills landing directly on the furniture.

##### Maintaining Cleanliness Around the Home

Encourage household members to keep their immediate surroundings tidy. Regularly clean up spills and crumbs, as these can lead to stains if left unattended. A clean environment not only looks better but also minimizes the risk of accidental damage.

### Immediate Response to Spills

Despite your best efforts, spills can still happen. Knowing how to respond quickly can prevent minor incidents from becoming major problems. Here are some steps to take immediately after a spill occurs:

#### Act Quickly

The sooner you address a spill, the better. Blot the spill with a clean, dry cloth to absorb as much liquid as possible. Avoid rubbing the spill, as this can spread the stain deeper into the fabric.

##### Use Appropriate Cleaning Solutions

Depending on the type of spill and the fabric, you may need different cleaning solutions. For water-based spills, a mixture of mild dish soap and warm water can work effectively. For oil-based spills, use a solvent-based cleaner specifically designed for fabric.

#### Test Cleaning Solutions

Before applying any cleaning solution to the entire affected area, test it on a small, inconspicuous section of the upholstery first. This ensures that the solution does not damage or discolor the fabric.

##### Dry the Area Thoroughly

After cleaning, use a clean, dry towel to blot the area until no more moisture is absorbed. Allow the upholstery to air dry completely. Avoid using heat sources like hairdryers, as excessive heat can set stains permanently.

### Regular Maintenance and Care

Regular maintenance is key to keeping your furniture looking its best. Incorporate cleaning and inspection routines into your home care schedule to catch potential issues early.

#### Cleaning Routines

Schedule periodic deep cleans for your furniture, especially if it sees frequent use. Use appropriate cleaning products and tools recommended for your upholstery type. Vacuum regularly to remove dirt and debris that can contribute to wear and tear.

##### Professional Help

If you encounter stubborn stains or require specialized cleaning techniques, consider hiring professional cleaners. They have the expertise and equipment to handle tough jobs without damaging the upholstery.

By implementing these preventive measures and responding quickly to spills, you can significantly extend the life and beauty of your furniture. Remember, a little effort now can save you from costly repairs and replacements down the line.

Upholstery Care Tips: Maintaining Your Furniture Long-Term
----------------------------------------------------------

When it comes to maintaining your upholstery over the long-term, understanding how to properly care for it can make all the difference. Whether you're dealing with delicate fabrics or more robust materials, regular upkeep can ensure your furniture looks great for years to come. Here are some essential tips to keep your upholstery in top condition.

### Cleaning Regularly

Maintaining clean upholstery starts with regular cleaning. Dust, dirt, and spills can accumulate over time, leading to stains and wear. Vacuuming your upholstery once a week is a good practice. Use the appropriate attachment for your fabric type‚Äîsoft brushes for delicate fabrics and bristle attachments for tougher spots. If you have pets, consider vacuuming more frequently as pet hair can quickly build up.

#### Deep Cleaning Solutions

For deeper cleaning, you might want to rent a steam cleaner or hire a professional. Steam cleaning can remove embedded dirt and grime, and it's especially useful for heavily used areas like living room sofas. Always test a small, inconspicuous area first to ensure the cleaner doesn't damage or discolor the fabric.

##### DIY Cleaning Options

*   **Vinegar Solution:**¬†Mix equal parts white vinegar and water. Apply the solution with a spray bottle, let it sit for a few minutes, then blot with a clean cloth.
    
*   **Baking Soda:**¬†Sprinkle baking soda over the upholstery, let it sit overnight, then vacuum it up. This helps absorb odors and can help remove minor stains.
    
*   **Club Soda:**¬†For fresh spills, club soda can be effective. Pour it onto the spill, let it soak for a few minutes, then blot dry.
    

### Spotting Stains Promptly

Immediate action is key when it comes to stain removal. The longer a spill sits, the harder it becomes to remove. For spills, start by blotting up as much of the liquid as possible with a clean, dry cloth. Avoid rubbing, which can spread the stain and embed it further into the fabric.

#### Common Stain Removal Tips

*   **Red Wine:**¬†Blot immediately with a clean cloth. For stubborn stains, mix one tablespoon dish soap, one tablespoon white vinegar, and two cups warm water. Apply the solution with a sponge, then blot dry.
    
*   **Oil-Based Stains:**¬†Use cornstarch or talcum powder to absorb the oil. Let it sit for several hours, then vacuum up the powder before cleaning the area with a mild detergent solution.
    
*   **Ink:**¬†Use rubbing alcohol or hairspray. Apply the solvent to a cotton ball and gently dab the stain until it lifts.
    

### Protective Measures

To prevent future damage, consider protective measures. Fabric protectors can create a barrier against spills and stains. These products are available in spray form and can be applied easily at home. Always follow the manufacturer‚Äôs instructions and test on a small area first.

#### Choosing the Right Products

Not all protectors are created equal. Look for products designed for the specific type of fabric you have. Some protectors work better on synthetic fibers, while others are more effective on natural materials like cotton or wool.

1iprk06,https://i.redd.it/hsfj81qtr7je1.jpeg,Found an Oasis (Al Nuaim) in the desert (literally),"So, only yesterday I posted about Cool Weather attar and two guys pointed out to buy attars from local shop for better testing and pricing. I didn't know any such shop is around me, a small town in Kutch, Gujarat. (So, desert, literally).

Last evening, I entered a recently opened Agarbatti shop and got a sweet shock when I saw this rack full of Al Nuaim attars !! What more, the 60ish guy himself is in fragrance business (mainly pooja materials) since 2 generations and had much knowledge (and coffee beans to smell) too !!

I smelt handful of Al Nuaim (basically I was being shy as he was so friendly to open all packs for me regardless I buy or not). Tuscan Leather felt Tobacco heavy so I thought would buy in next winter. (Later I found this is clone of same named famous perfume).

At the same time, there was a notification from this group. Describing Club De Nuit clone of this brand. I asked, he showed me Delicia (in first picture). And said CDN clone is replaced with this name. I smelt it but couldn't get any note clearly. He applied Blueberry one on my wrist. Was a fruity blast. Lasted even after I washed hands 1 hr later.

In the end, I bought Black Opum (would review later) for just 80 bucks. Have gone noseblind so would review later.

Please see all the pics and let me know if any recommendations from you guys.

However, I have been out with people I've had casual relationships with before and the rule has always been discretion so no one gets the idea that we're together. Just act like friends, because that's all we are. 

As a bi woman, this is also the first time I've properly been with another woman, so that also adds to the ""first time excitement"" of the whole thing, but I went out to coffee with a fwb and called her cute and she called me cute back and there was no hesitation. No making sure no one heard. No worrying about someone thinking we might be together. It was just a lovely little moment between us, and in general she's expressed that she's perfectly fine with people knowing we're hooking up and hanging out and stuff. 

I've never had that before and it's made me strangely emotional. I guess I didn't realize how much it sucked to be seen as something to be hidden or kept secret, even when the motivation for it wasn't shame at being seen with me in that way (though sometimes it definitely was). I guess I just wanted to get that out there and get a little pat on the back for both the situation and allowing myself to be that open in public, though it was an admittedly small thing.",3,1739586449.0,CongratsLikeImFive,0,1.0,False

(Sorry for any mistakes, english is not my main language)  


TL;DR version at the end.

  
So, last December I reconnected with this girl I met 5 years ago (I'm 31 and she was 33). I always liked her and we followed each other but we never really talked that much. We met at this bar and things took of from there.

  
I always thought she would be nice partner based on what I saw in social media (I know, dumb on my part) she talked a lot about being multiple long term relationships, being faithful and open. She also liked traveling and photography a lot; which I am a fan too.  
We started going out and the chemistry was there (emotionally, intellectually, sexually) I always felt we would click but goddamn I did not expect to click that much.  
Weeks go by and we are talking a lot about a future, we talked about how we didn't want to rush anything but we could see each other dating long term.  
For some reason I always felt we would date either 2 weeks or 2 years (most of my friends told me the same which will become kind of funny at the end)  
  
One day we go out with some of my friends so I can introduce her to them bc I think since we will end up being long term, might as well introduce them right away (foolish of me, I always try o avoid that)  I am ordering some food and my friend tells me some guys seems to be hitting on her. I go just to check the situation and she starts acting very weird around that guy and his friend. I try to pay no mind but at some point its clear that she likes their attention, I get pissed and jealous and I tell her straight forward that I don't like how she is behaving around them, the guys starts telling her that I'm clearly very jealous and she keeps talking to him for a while before coming to my side.  


My friends clearly think the whole thing is super fishy on how she is behaving and the whole mood gets super tense. We go out of the bar to a super market and I tell her how her attitude was super wrong, she tries to tell me I'm making a huge drama out of nowhere and I tell her she is downplaying my emotions, I'm just communicating something that made me feel uncomfortable and if it was the other way around, she would have felt the same (already had a partner that gaslighted me and made me feel it was always me making drama, so I got experience).   
She ends up accepting she messed up and telling me on her eyes, its only the first week we are dating (its been a month at this point) and that she still is unsure if she really wants to date me long term.  
We spend the whole evening talking, I tell her that she is clearly still putting a barrier between us, that I'm 100% certain I want to be with her and that if she pushes me away but doesn't let me go, that really ends up hurting long term and if that was the case it would be better to break up. She tells me that night that the the idea of breaking up scares her a lot and that she is convinced she wants to keep trying.

I tell her to see it as a bump on the road and now we now need to set clear limits however inside me I was like, ok this is the first strike, 2 more and I need to get out of there.

  
We both go to our houses, get some rest and continue the conversation the next days. She tells me to get ready because she is now going full throttle, no regrets or fears and for me to be ready for her becoming intense. I tel her I'm ready and we move on.

She starts sending me a bunch of zodiac compatibility between ourselves and how intense things are and will be (I know, I know... She was one of those but I liked it) and we talk about how we are indeed very intense, pationate and that we would help each other grow a lot. We go out every day or every 2 days and she is constantly telling me how much she loves me, that she wants to have my children and how it will be like when we move together.

  
At this point everything is going amazing and I feel extremely happy with her. Its been a long time since I felt like that with a partner.

  
I tell her that I was going to Mexico to see a show on March and I was planning on staying there for 3 weeks. She tells me she was planning the same thing around the same time and eventually the conversation evolves to ""Lets travel together!"". We both get super excited and start looking tickets, where to stay, shows that we could go, etc. I go back from my house excited that one of my dreams is becoming true (flying with a partner and seeing a new country)

This was the beginning of the end...

A week goes by, we are seeing the possibility of how we could fly together (she got fired the same day we started going out; so she had a bunch of money saved but was trying to see how she could spend less). It gets kind of tough with the whole logistic for different reasons. I tell her that the next time we see each other we can sit down and see what chances we got. She says ok and the week goes normal. 

We are talking on instagram; I sent her a reel about questions that you should ask your partner and she tells me, this is super important, the next time we see we also need to talk about this. I tell her I'm okay with it and agree to do it.  


She comes to my house, we are talking normally and she sits me down and tells me the classic ""we need to talk"". I get super anxious, she sits down and starts telling me she is unsure about the trip for multiple reasons, I ask her about it and she starts telling me a bunch of reasons that contradict each other ""example: I was thinking about moving and living there full time so I can work and stay with friends, but I met you and things have changed"" and then ""No I would never go there and live full time, I have too much things here, it would be only for 2 months"".  
She starts going in circles and I have to get serious and stop her, I look her in the eyes and tell her ""I need you to be fully clear to me about the exact reasons why you are doubting; if its because of the fact that you are unemployed and are scared about the money, then say it; if its because you think its too soon for us or there is something that you don't like about me, then please tell me but be straight forward with me. I do not like the fact that you seem to be using all kinds of excuses instead of just telling me the truth"".

  
She gets serious and tells me ""you know, its very tough to lie to you. you can easily see trough me and that makes me afraid."" I joke her back saying ""Hey you were always complaining about how your exes kept everything bottled up and you were asking about a boyfriend that was honest, blunt and straight forward. Now you got one and you realize is not as easy huh?"". She laughs at it and we resume the conversation, however she is still evading pretty much everything until I get upset and tell her to cut the bullshit. She finally opens up and tells me ""The fact that you would be the one paying makes me uncomfortable, I do have money for the trip, but it was considering the fact that I could stay with friends, now if I go with you its different because I'll have to pay more.""

I thank her for admitting it and tell her ""Hey, we don't need to go 50/50 I mean, I was already planning on paying an airbnb, so the money is already budgeted. So we can arrange it in some other way (we split it 75/25, or I handle staying, she handles the food, or some other alternatives). For me the most important part is not the money; is that we travel together and enjoy ourselves.

She ends up agreeing and telling me that yeah we can do that. I feel happy again because the travel is still up and we move on with the questions about the relationship.

  
We go over the questions and there is one in specific ""How does your partner makes you feel valued and what do they do that makes you feel appreciated"". I tell her I like everything she does and go in depth why. She tells me I'm ""almost perfect"" but there are things she doubts or doesn't like. I ask her why and we go into another whole circle of she saying things but nor being clear about any of it until I get upset and ask her to leave the topic there since its very frustrating trying to get the truth out of her like an investigator.  
I won't bore you with the details of the conversation since this post is already very long, but it ends up being ""I don't want to compare you, but my exes did somethings that you don't do that much. Which of course makes me kind of miss those things"". We talk about it and I agree that there are somethings I will look into but there are some that I won't since its now who I am. She says its fine and we move on.

  
Fast forward one week after that, everything is fine, we go out on a Sunday; she comes to my place and hits me with another ""we need to talk"". I get super anxious again and let her speak. She tells me ""Im sorry to bring your illusions down, but I've been thinking about the trip and honestly; I think its better that we don't do it. I feel its to soon for us and honestly, traveling \*brings the worse in people out\*"" I tell her ""hey, its the second time you back out of the trip. I won't keep pushing, it honestly makes me feel very sad but I won't insist anymore. However I d not agree on the ""bringing the worse in people out"" I feel its an amazing experience. Can it have stressful situations? Yes. But is it the worse for people, no.""  
We go into a conversation into why she thinks that is true and I don't; we end up agreeing that we disagree. We try to relax for a while before she goes back to her place but get into another small argument about the trip. I ask there that we leave the topic there and just leave it be for the moment.

She agrees and tells me she has to leave bc she is having dinner with her mom. We say goodbye and keep on chatting trough messages. I open up with her about the ""We need to talk"" openings and how anxious that makes me. I tell her I have some serious traumas with that bc of some past relationships and some issues with my family. She tells me she understands and tells me ""You are right, I could open with Hey, I need to talk about the trip, instead of making a whole scene"". We have a pleasant conversation about it where she seems very understanding.

However, I felt that her energy suddenly shifted, she seemed a little bit more cold on how she replied.

On my side, I felt this was the 2nd strike, bc how it was becoming an emotional rollercoaster.  
I tried to pay no mind and continue my week.  
3 days go by and she is now replying differently (more cold and takes longer to reply). I knew she was on her period but something in me is telling me something changed.

 I tell she that my mom is coming to visit and we text about it casually. She tells me that she is going to have a coffee with a friend in the afternoon and that she expects ""to leave early"". The day goes by normal, I talk with my mom about this ""awesome girl I'm dating, how happy I am and how are views in family, relationship and kids is very similar"" (Just about to make a clown out of myself with my mom)

The girl starts texting me and I tel her I'm sitting down with my mom having some coffee and out of nowhere she starts fighting me (she had done that in the past a few times). She starts complaining about a lot of things, saying that I never invited her to anything and that I made complaints about me expending on her. But that its ""fine"" and she doesn't want to ""make a whole deal about it while I'm with my mom, which of course she just did anyway.  
I ask my mom for some time and start replying to her, I reply to her reassuring her its fine and that I have no issues with any of that. we speak for about half an hour (very stressful by the way, since I had to tell my mom that I had to speak to the girl bc she was feeling very upset.)  
The conversation with her ends up with a ""You are completely right. I actually have nothing to tell you, you always reply so calmly, honest and caring to me when all I wanna do is fight"".  
This raises a huge red flag bc I'm like, bro, so you are telling me you just were bored and wanted to fight?????? I was fine with it other times bc I knew we were joking but doing this serious of an issue while I'm with my mother AND YOU KNOW IT. And still did it just bc you ""felt bored""... that is very fucked up.  
I joke about it and just move on since I just want to go back to spend time with mother.

After that she stops replying for a while and my mom asks me if I'm busy on the weekend, bc she wanted to have lunch with us and meet her in person. I get very uncomfortable bc she is very excited about it but I know something is going on with her so I tell my mom ""let me talk with her and I'll get back at you"".

I send her a text even tough she hadn't replied to my last message and ask her ""hey, what are you doing on the weekend?"". I see the time and its the time she was going to the date with this guy. I try to pay no mind and remain calm.  
However things were about to take a bad twist.

My mom leaves, I'm sitting down and starting to work and start having a bunch of problems at work, my boss ends up calling me and starts to complaining about a lot of things I messed up (half of them I did mess up) and asks me to fix everything ASAP.

I start working super anxious and stressed out. The hours go by and she doesn't reply.  
So I'm trying to fix everything, feeling anxious about my job, starting to get afraid I might get fired.  
And she hasn't replied for hours after going on a date with this random guy.  
The jealousy and paranoia start taking the best of me, I'm trying to work while constantly checking if she had replied. (Not my proudest moment honestly).

She ends up texting me almost 6 hours later and just replies to my question about what she was doing on the weekend saying one day she was going to a show and the other she wanted to go to one but didn't get tickets.  
At this point it is evident she is acting differently (whenever I asked in the past her she would say something like ""I'm busy around this time but we can see each other after that or the next day"").  
I start accepting the fact that probably she isn't feeling it anymore and that its probably time to end things. This is the third strike.  
I text her back with a simple ""Ok"" and she text me back after a while with a ""I'm on my way home now. But why, did want to hang out"" and a smilie face.  
I tell her that I would like to talk in person or call her (We live very close by; 15 minute drive so its never been an issue).  
She is taking a long time between responses and not saying no, but just avoiding the idea of meeting.  
She tells me I'm sorry; I wanted to go to your house but I have a massive headache, so I want to rest in my house"" (she did suffer from those constantly even when we were good) but if I needed to talk we could do it on the phone.  
I ask her about the date and tell her that my mother wanted to meet her on the weekend. 

She told me a lot of details about the date, it ended up being something casual with a friend. She did mention how she didn't like him bc he was too short and yada yada but he always asked her out and that she preferred guys with my height bc she is very short, but the guy was even shorter. etc etc etc.

At this point I don't even care about the whole thing, I just wanted to figure out wtf was going on between us.  
Again she asks me about the weekend and I tell her, well, as I mentioned to you my mom wanted to invite you to have dinner and meet you. But this is like a huge step for me so I need to know we are good before I do, so how are you feeling with us dating? Is there something you want to open up or talk about?   
She sends me a long as audio (almost 9 minutes), with the first half stating how much she loves me, how when we are together everything feels perfect, that we have so much chemistry in all the ways and  even how she has never felt so pleased with any partner (if you catch my drift ;) )  
But its the distance that makes her doubt a lot and she is still not sure if she wants to be with me or not. If I'm even ""the one"" for her even tough I hit all the marks and that she know that this uncertainty is the one hurting me and she doesn't want to tell em these things bc she know its opening the possibility of breaking up, eve tough she understands it might be necessary for me.  
I thank her for her honesty and we go into a long as audio conversation about the whole thing.  
I tell her a lot of things my therapist told me about us, things I noticed and what I was looking for.  
I won't go too much into the details but I opened up about my feelings, how much it was hurting me that she at this point, was still feeling uncertain and holding that emotional barrier with me while I had accepted multiple times to lower for her and that I wanted to be with her.  
I knew we were not good for each other but a part of me held the hope that she would at least try to put a fight for us instead of giving up everything so easy.  
She opened up about a lot of her self esteem, that having no job made her feel very uncertain and that she was facing a lot of issues with herself, her image, and what she wanted to do in life.  
She tells me how she is feeling pressured to get married and have children bc her time is ""running out"" and she feels a lot of pressure form herself and society.

  
At this point I open up about a lot of things I hand't told her, like how she and her friends tell way too much to each other (which also made me uncomfortable bc at points I felt that there was no privacy) and how that influence with the comments they tell her its hurting her on feeling rushed into that. How her family is doing the same and that makes me uncomfortable for her. She openly accepts that its true however she has accepted it as part of her life and that she will never improve in any way-

  
I end up sending her this long as text trying to be super supportive about her self image, how she is and amazing person and her energy is magnetic, how much people like and love her and even why that is a reason so many guys hit on her. I even opened up how I went trough an extremely traumatic experience and it took me years to recover so I believed she could to.

  
Her response about the whole thing baffled me. She did not address anything about the experience I had. She just replied the ""how she amazing person and her energy is magnetic"" part with a. ""but how does that help me? How does that work for me if I don't get what I want?""  


Nah man, I just throw my hands in the air like, really, from the whole thing this is what you got???? Like wtf is this self pity bulltshit.

  
The conversation ends up like:  
Me -So what do you want?

Her -to have a family and... well I don't want to sound basic.

Me -and have kids (I already knew since we spoke about it a ton of times and she even told me she would love to have children with me EVEN IF I LEFT, which I said I would always want to form part of the life of my kids even if we broke up)

Her: - :| (serious emoji)

Me: - I understand. Its very late and I don't think there is much point in moving forward. Its clear that this won't work. Lets leave it at this and we can talk tomorrow so I can return you your stuff.

Her: I know. you know what I take it back. Please forget everything!

Me: you regret what? Breaking up?

Her: Yes. Nevermind.

Me -: I'm sorry, but that uncertainty about everything is the very reason we are breaking up. I don't want to do it but you pushed me to this point. So lets not hurt ourselves any further.  
Her: you are right.

We talk the next day, I tell her that I'll stop by her place to drop her stuff we sit down in her bed, talk about the whole situation. I open up about how frustrated I am about the whole situation, again how I don't want to break up, how its been so long since I found this connection with anyone and she is just letting it go so easily, how for a lot of things she only focused on whats bad.  
Even on how ironic it was the she always brought up the idea of us having children and getting married and now she was not sure she could ""fulfill my expectations "" of getting married and having children. 

Also, how ironic was that she was 33, older than me, and how her decision making and attitudes were very childish at many points.

I mentioned to her her: ""I don't understand how is it that you are so afraid of getting old, losing your chance of having kids and a family; yet you are letting go the one guy that you have clicked so well that wants the same thing as you; I guess it wasn't just meant to be""  
  
The whole time she is just incapable of looking me in the eyes,. She tells me that I'm too strong for being able to look at her directly, telling her those things and that she is glad I'm the one breaking up with her because she never could.

We end up embracing each other, just hugging. Accepting and feeling that bittersweet feeling of how good we feel each other but we are both letting it go.  
We end up kissing and having break up S3X. One of the best we both had.  
We laugh about it and I tell her, this is what you are letting go right? Just want to make that clear haha.

We get dressed and joke about the whole thing like the old times.  
\-I tell her so what now, do you want to go for a beer in our last evening? 

She accepts and asks me where? I say: Hey, lets go to the bar where we both went in our second date, kind of where we both accepted we were going to start dating officially so I have my dramatic closure.

We laugh about it and go there. We have a beer and a meal and joke about all the things we didn't end up doing; how the name of our kids were going to waste and how I wished her luck since I knew her next partners would suck in bed (running joke we had).

We talk about how we felt this was not a ""goodbye forever"" but a ""See you someday"". I leave to go meet with a friend for another beer since I knew if I got home I would feel like shit and not sleep.

We give each other one last kiss and leave.  
We kept texting casually for the next weekend. We both traveled for different reasons and kind of have a similar experience of going out of out city into nature to clear out.

I come back to my house on monday after traveling and accept the fact I have to let it go, but one part of me doesn't. I struggle with it a lot.  
She reminded me on our last night that I forgot to bring her something she left, so I could give it back.   
I text her to let me know when she is home so I can send it to her. She says ""sure, but there is no rush.""  
I just say ok, and we don't speak the next 2 days.

I make the decision to still fly to Mexico by myself and buy the tickets

  
This past days I really struggled with the whole situation, between accepting the fact that it won't work and wanting to talk. I felt that I had to leave my ego aside and just accept I missed her and try to talk as friends at least and let my anger and frustration go.

Yesterday I messaged her asking her how she was doing. We talked casually about how we were feeling and accepted its been tough.  
I asked her, hey, do you want to go out and have some coffee and we can talk.  
She tells me ""Of course, I will always accept a coffee date; but we need to go somewhere cheap because Im need to save money since I bough my tickets to Mexico"" (a little bit ironic haha)

I tell her I did the same and if she wanted to meet either today or tomorrow for the coffee, that we could go to a cheap cafeteria or I could go to her house so we didn't spend as much.

  
She hasn't replied since, at this point its clear that she is ghosting me.

I don't regret texting her because it was part of letting everything go. I do feel a little bit as a clown though haha, but hey. Its part of the process. Its just sucked that everything matched with Valentine and I see all this happy couples on Instagram while I'm sitting here feeling like a fool.

  
Oh and the whole 2 weeks vs 2 years dating? First my friends made the bet that it wasn't going to last more than 2 months (I didn't know). After a month when they saw me I was falling in love (they never seen me like that with a girl) they changed the bet and gave different ranges within the 2 years and that she was breaking up with me in the end.

Then I came back and told them I broke up with her they all complained and told me about the bet saying they betted for it to last longer. My best friend said ""bro c'mon, you were my horse, I betted everything for your long run lmao; now I lost the bet""  I just laughed since I've done the same bet with other friends.

Any toughts, do you feeling it was love bombing? Was I being fooled? Was I very immature with the situation?

  
TL;DR

I started going out with this friend from years ago. We have so much chemistry its insane. Shew tells me she wants to get married and have kids in the future. We start planning a travel together to Mexico,  everything is well. Suddenly she backs down; starts getting distant and tells me she is not sure about having a future with me even tought she loves me. I have to breakup with her. We dated for 2 months.  
Now she is ghosting me on valentines.",2,1739586438.0,BreakUps,0,1.0,False

I 16f and my dad, 51m 6 monthsish ago moved out from the apartment we lived in with my step mom, 47f. 
This will be long because the background information is very important, and a lot. 
8 years of my life a lot, lmao.
At 7 i met my step mom, dad and her dated for a few long years and got married when I was 9. 
2018 they got jobs far out of where we lived. 
To much gas, not enough money. 
We moved out of town away from family and friends, turned out to be the worst decision ever lmao. 
Before this, step mom, I'll call ms was always like my mom, if someone asked who my mom was I'd say it was S. 
(Bio mom is a deadbeat abuser) 
In our new home, ms's  cousin (also my parents boss) 
Started to tell her that my dad was cheating and he had children with another woman at work. 
Dad had quit so money was tight, so money and (allegedly) infidelity problems, obviously they fought, a lot. 
That's normal, what's not normal is the intensity, ms and dad would scream so loud cops would be called. 
Ms got depressed to the point of thinking about taking her life. 
On my 10th birthday, 2019, shit hit the fan. 
My dad posted a happy birthday announcement on his Facebook for me,
Well, Ms, lost. Her. Danm. Shit. 
She screamed at him all morning, accused him of being a pedophile, and wanting a sexual relationship with me, (yk, his 10 year old DAUGHTER.) 
She called the cops on him, so everyone was questioned by police officers, I had to answer questions to a cop on my 10th birthday (happy 10th birthday!!) 
All I remember from that day is the fight, my step brother, N telling me it was all my fault because I just never listen, and telling the nice(?) Cop, it's my birthday. 
Eventually after some major issues happened, Ms's depression, N skipping school and smoking joints, and me hurting myself, we moved back just before covid. 
I spent grade 6 in online school lol, 
The most I remember from that house was when Ms threw dad's phone outside and smashed it, and more cop involment, N moving out because Ms couldn't buy expensive stuff. Then R moving in because of attempting multiple times. 
Me and ms were never close again, not like how she was to her sons, I didn't fully grasp that I had lost my mom after everything. 

Summer of 2022 I think, we moved into another house, I loved this house lol, and my room, I really miss my room :(
Some fights here and there, no cops, my mental health was bad as always, but everyone was rightfully focused on R. 

February 2023, we could no longer afford to rent there, stress built up, and it exploded, ms and dad fought, and a few days before my 14th birthday, Ms and R moved out, into a pre paid TWO bedroom apartment, planning to leave me and dad alone. 
I think that was the moment when I realized I had lost my mom, she was willing to abandon me, just like that? It really effected me badly. 
Eventually dad forgave her and we moved in, for a year or two I slept on a mattress on the floor, or on the couch and like Harry potter I had a little closet for my pc LMAO. 

September 2024, a two days before my second year of high-school, me and Ms argued over noodles in a bowl, (stupid right?) Yeah, she hated me cooking even though I was 15 lmao. 
I guess this put an seed for an argument between dad and Ms, because the next morning around 6, my dad is shaking me awake and telling me to get some stuff together, important stuff and we needed to go in that moment, in the car he told me she hit him, three times. 
And ever since then, we've been living at my grandparents. 

Here's what I need advice on, my dad frequently goes over to have coffee ect ect. 
I'm always reaching out to her, never the other way around, and conveniently when she says she messages me but I never answer, somehow I never get them. 
Lately, after new years when she didn't answer me, I stopped reaching out. I have learnt from bio mom it hurts way more to reach out and beg for a reply, than it does to just drop off. 
Her birthday was yesterday, I didn't wish her a happy birthday, dad got her a card, and wrote my name on it. It made me mad, which I shouldn't be, lol, I should be the bigger person, but ever since my 10th birthday, I've only ever gotten a shitty birthday where I'm alone or she starts an argument with dad, and my dad is the only one to get me a birthday card, not once from her, not even signed, so why should I be the bigger person, when all she does it hurt me? She makes no effort, and recently I've learnt she never has. She never spends one on one time with me without turning it into a danm fight. She makes me feel like a burden, and being near her makes me spiral back into old destructive habits. But I can tell living at my grandparents is weighing on everyone. My dad is stressed because my grandparents are stressed. The easy thing to do would be to just say fuck it, and move back in with Ms, even though I think I might actually die, but it's only basically two years before I could move out. I've lived 6 years with these feelings and issues, maybe I could survive two more years. 
Idk, I love my dad, and seeing him cry destroys me, I just want to make things easier for him. 
Any advice is appreciated, hell even calling me out on bullshit lmao, maybe I'm being a spoiled brat who is butt hurt over something not that deep. 
 
I don't have internet at home right now, so I won't be able to answer questions right away if anyone has some, sorry:'(",1,1739586309.0,FamilyIssues,0,1.0,False

1iprh1y,https://www.reddit.com/r/pancreatitis/comments/1iprh1y/back_pain/,Back pain,"Hey guys. I am 17 years old. I had many problems due to my irresponsibility during my live. I gor prescribed medicines and diets, but ended up smoking weed and giving an absolute fuck about everything I had to do. 

So, last time I was drinking pretty much of coffee and eating sweets for a month cause I was smoking weed, and just couldn‚Äôt stop. Last time I visited the doctor before I started to do it I made ultrasound and got told that my pancreas is a little bit bigger, but absolutely not critically. Also I have my elastase like 166 last time. 

Like 2 weeks ago when I ended up with all that whit I was doing to my health I noticed a constant back pain in the night. Like burning. It could last for many hours. I also got told by a doctor that I had a bile stasis, so I decided to take choleretics ( I thought my back pain was due to this) So after 2 weeks of taking choleretics I woke up and drank a water and felt a pain in my solar plexus. Then I had a breakfast and started to feel like my left part of abdomen is heavy. I wasn‚Äôt eating healthy ( fried, sauces etc) That day after other unhealthy meal I felt a stabbing pain in left abdomen. I immediately texted to one doctor in Ukraine( I am in Spain rn and am not going back) and she told me she can‚Äôt prescribe me anything cause it harms in 99% cases. But she told to get rid of choleretics FOREVER. I did as she said and then had a trip to Madrid. I couldn‚Äôt really eat healthy there so I ate unhealthy dimplings with sauces and in few hours for the first time felt severe pain in left abdomen even though I took Creon before. Rn I am on a diet ( no frying, spices, sauces etc) Haven‚Äôt had severe pain episodes since. Sometimes I can feel a little pain in left abdomen, mostly when I consume food that ends up in few minutes and radiates to the back. Since I still have severe back pains. But I sometimes ate few cookies, avocados. So am thinking about stopping consuming high-fat products for a while.
I really don‚Äôt think I have a chronic pancreatitis. Cause I don‚Äôt really have symptoms like nausea, my shit look ok, but I have yellow dotes in it. But it doesn‚Äôt look really bad tbh. When I had enzyme deficiency I had the same looking shit. So the only problem is that I lost 2kg and also have a burning really agonising back pain in the night. I really don‚Äôt have any opportunity to see my doctor here in Spain . In most cases they won‚Äôt do any diagnostics and will just prescribe some medications that will destroy your health even more. So now I am on Creon 10000 after each meal that‚Äôs it. Hope my pain will disappear soon cause it‚Äôs really painful and I am just 17üò≠

I hope sport ( I train 2 day a day judo), sleep, diet will help.

P.s Oh, I also take antibiotics rn for 5 days. That‚Äôs it, I had a severe sinusitis. My immune system is fucked  ( due to no sleep schedule and weed, bad diet, alcohol) Yeah I know I did a lot of mistakes and hope to recover and get well soon.

Wish me luck. Also if you can advice me something tell me.",1,1739586240.0,pancreatitis,0,1.0,False

There was this deep sense of togetherness‚Äîlike no matter what, you had people who genuinely cared, who checked in on you, who had your back through thick and thin. Sleepovers, late-night conversations, hanging out for no reason‚Äîfriendships felt pure, built on a foundation of shared experiences and emotional support rather than convenience.

But as I‚Äôve gotten older, that feeling of brotherhood and belonging seems to have completely disappeared. Adult friendships often feel transactional‚Äîonly maintained as long as there‚Äôs some material benefit involved. Maybe it‚Äôs work connections, networking opportunities, or someone needing a favor. But once that purpose is served, the friendship quietly fades away. It‚Äôs like people don‚Äôt see value in relationships unless there‚Äôs something to gain from them.

Even when I try to genuinely connect with people, it feels like everyone is ‚Äútoo busy‚Äù with their lives. And sure, I get it‚Äîwork, responsibilities, family obligations. But at the same time, I see those same people scrolling on TikTok for hours, binge-watching shows, or going out only when it benefits them in some way. It makes me wonder: are people really that busy, or do they just not care enough to maintain friendships anymore?

I remember back in school or college, friendships didn‚Äôt require constant effort or scheduling. If you liked someone, you just spent time with them. You didn‚Äôt have to book a time weeks in advance just to catch up over coffee. Now, everything feels like a chore. People will say, ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs catch up soon!‚Äù but deep down, you both know it probably won‚Äôt happen.

It‚Äôs made me question whether I‚Äôm just bad at making or keeping friends, or if this is just an inevitable part of adulthood. Does everyone feel this way? Does everyone just silently deal with this loneliness and pretend it‚Äôs normal? Because if so, that‚Äôs kind of depressing.

I try to remind myself that I still have my family, and I‚Äôm grateful for that. But sometimes, I wonder‚Äîoutside of them, is there really anyone who truly has my back? Or is adulthood just a slow realization that, in the end, you‚Äôre mostly on your own?

Hi! I‚Äôm Stephanie. I‚Äôm 34, and live in Western Canada. I am looking for an online connection, something close to a relationship. I‚Äôd like to find someone I can confide in, and enjoy spending time talking to, and vice versa. 

I am interested in talking to someone similar in age to me or older. Similar time zone would also be preferred, but not a dealbreaker. I am looking for someone that is able to maintain conversation and put in effort(I will do the same!). Other than that, I don‚Äôt have any specific personality/physical traits that are mandatory. I am looking preferably for something longer term/ongoing, but that obviously depends on how well we click, but would prefer to only receive messages from people interested in the same. I am single, and would prefer that you are as well. I‚Äôm not looking to change my situation at this time, but do crave a relationship-like connection. I‚Äôm not interested in anything solely or immediately nsfw in nature, I prefer to know a person quite well before that. 

Here are some things I enjoy/a bit about me:
* big fan of tv shows/movies. I love horror the best, but not exclusively! 
* Music! My favorite band since is Blink 182, has been since I was 15. 
* I love to shop, and get my nails done
* Big fan of coffee(but not a snob about it)
* I enjoy getting some exercise every day, developing a love for walking has done wonders for my mental health
*[This is what I look like](https://imgur.com/a/zUFNfnA)

That‚Äôs just a small look into who I am, but definitely looking forward to getting to know someone on a much deeper level. Please be willing to share photos of yourself, and I will obviously do the same. If my post interests you, please reply with your name, age, where you are located(does not have to be exact location!) and a bit about yourself so we can get a conversation started! Chats preferred over messages.

The man that put up the thumb for the picture then goes and  ""bumps"" into the man, talking about him being in his late 20s and still catching Pokemon, in doing that, he steals his wallet and heads to the ATM and withdraws money.

2. The same man from the ""selfie"" stops a lady and asks to see her receipt, once he does, the girl from earlier slips past him and they switch receipts, he hands her the receipt back, and it cuts to the girl walking to a chasier with a coffee machine box, asking for a refund.

3. The girl is sitting next to a business man and spurts mustard on his jacket, she ""helps"" take the jacket off and the guy grabs his wallet, quickly giving it to another man who is on a phone call, he reads off the numbers of the business man's credit card, and ID for a plane ticket, he then upgrades it.

I put together the Breville smart grinder and made another. I was closer but it was not the sweet balanced flavor I was used to. I adjusted the grind size and timed my pour and on the third try I got it! It felt really good to make my own espresso at home instead of spending $6 on a latte.

1ipqty8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parenting/comments/1ipqty8/how_to_deal_with_carelessness_also_having_trouble/,"How to deal with' carelessness? Also, having trouble adjusting to a big move.","I (45 F) have been married to my husband (46 F) for almost 20 years now. We have 2 kids. My daughter is 16 and my son just turned 13. I'm not sure if I'm venting or asking for advice. Maybe both. I just feel so tired.  
  
In December, we moved across the country due to my husband's work. It was a hard decision since it meant leaving behind our extended families and our friends, but we decided an extra $50k a year was too hard to turn down. We used to both work full-time remotely back in our old city, but now my husband has to go into the office and I still work remotely. My son's seems to have adapted to his new school quickly, while daughter absolutely hates that we moved and hasn't forgiven us. Honestly, I'm starting to think maybe she's right and that moving was a mistake.  
  
We have a husky (3M). I wanted a smaller and calmer breed, but my husband and my son really wanted a husky. My husband always had huskies as a kid. I did some research and eventually said okay since we're a pretty physically active household, although... I should have stuck to my guns in retrospect. My husband and I used to share the responsibility more, but his new job is really demanding. So now it's on me, mostly. And idk if you know what huskies are like but this dog has SO MUCH ENERGY.

Over the past year, I've been trying to teach my son how to train a dog. But it doesn't seem to stick at all. When the dog gives him puppy eyes, my son just gives him whatever he wants. He can't seem to adhere to any dog training rules for more than like a couple of days. It's gotten way worse since we moved. What little progress we made is now gone.  
  
The other day, my son let the dog annoy his sister by letting him into her room without her permission. She told him to stop, so he trapped her in her room with the dog. So I did what I felt was a reasonable punishment: I took away my son's video games for the weekend. The weather has been bad, and my son was upset at the idea of being trapped inside without video games. Apparently he decided it would be fun to roughhouse and play with the dog indoors, and they somehow knocked over the TV. Now it has a crack in it. My son apologized and insisted it was an accident (and convinced my husband it was) but I can't help but suspect that on some level it was retribution for taking his games away. And I hate that I'm not sure if I believe him or not.  
  
EVERY attempt I've made to train this dog has been undone by my husband and son. I had him decently trained, and I am the one who takes him on runs every day, but the second my son comes home, it's like this dog forgets everything I taught him. My son has basically trained the dog to jump on people, run around inside, or jump on the couch, and my husband has stopped caring. My husband runs with the dog on weekends, but during the week he does nothing.   
  
My son is very athletic, and as he's getting older it seems like he's just gotten... reckless. He doesn't have ADHD and can focus when he really needs to, but it's obvious that the ""good judgment"" part of his brain just hasn't fully developed yet. He breaks things constantly. Last year, he fell face-first through a glass coffee table at his friend's house because he was trying to show off his backflip. A few years ago, he broke his arm falling out of a tree that we told him not to climb. We get him cheap flip phones now because he loses/breaks his phone so much. He's CONSTANTLY losing things.

I think the most frustrating thing is that my husband hasn't been much help with anything. We both work full time but his new tech job now pays more than mine, and it's like he feels entitled to do less parenting because he's making more money. What really sucks is that we were actually doing FINE financially before all this. We lived near my family back in our old city, and now we live near 2 of my husband's old college buddies but that's all we've got right now. Now, I can't believe I let my husband convince me that it was a good idea to leave our support system behind for an extra $50k a year. My daughter has been getting so annoyed at my son and the dog that I barely see her anymore. She either stays out with her school friends or hides away in her room.

I‚Äôm struggling with this sometimes. Reality is‚Ä¶ there aren‚Äôt even that many chores. We live in an apartment and don‚Äôt have kids so not too much to maintain. My husband is not a messy person, he mostly cleans up after himself. The chore he 100% takes over is the trash. And he will help with things as needed, like helping with dishes or dealing with the coffee pot, though I still do those things at least half the time. I do a full place deeper cleanup every Saturday morning, usually while he sleeps in(I don‚Äôt like sleeping in tbh). I asked him to do that today since he had a long weekend and I‚Äôm working long hours this week and of course ended up having to do half of it and make him a list because he didn‚Äôt notice half the things that need to get done. On top of that he ended up basically telling me I created the messes and could have avoided them so it‚Äôs kind of my problem. These messes are the ones in the kitchen from cooking.

I‚Äôm the cook of the household. Including homemade breakfast most days(I don‚Äôt even eat breakfast), packing his lunch, cooking dinner(we do leftovers a couple nights a week though), and shopping for groceries. I enjoy cooking, I enjoy loving him that way but I can‚Äôt help but feel resentful that he won‚Äôt cook for me. I have family and friends at similar stages in life joking about their bfs or husbands being their personal chefs or going out of their way to cook whatever food they crave and I feel jealous. I remember hearing stories about my grandpa unwilling to cook anything for himself and always expecting my grandma or even his kids to feed him at meal times and I always thought that was so messed up(times have changed) and that I‚Äôd never allow that in my house and it seems that‚Äôs who I married. 

I feel like I can‚Äôt trust him to care for me or potential future kids if he is unwilling to cook. I‚Äôve of course told him these things and he just says cooking isn‚Äôt worth it for him, he‚Äôd rather eat plain rice or noodles or not eat than put effort into cooking. But that doesn‚Äôt cut it for me, since it‚Äôs not just him anymore, and even if he wouldn‚Äôt do it for himself why wouldn‚Äôt he do it for someone he loves? Or he says he‚Äôll just buy something- I‚Äôve noticed this is exactly his dad too- however I don‚Äôt want takeout or frozen food everytime I need help with meal prep, nor does it seem healthy or like a good use of money. I understand he may not have learned to cook much growing up, but he knows enough of the basics to follow a recipe and I‚Äôm happy to teach him. Anyways there is my gripe. 

I‚Äôve hinted and now voiced it many times. I occasionally ask for his help in the kitchen with prep or watching something as I do something else but I usually get moaning from him while he tells me it‚Äôs so much effort and he would never put in so much effort for a meal and he‚Äôd rather not eat than put this much effort into a dinner(keep in mind this is me asking him to do ONE step of cooking dinner because I‚Äôm getting home later).

I don‚Äôt think the custom products I make are those type of products. There‚Äôs only so many people that have a blue vw van and not only that they may only need two coffee mugs at most. 

I‚Äôd really like to focus on repeat printing/graphic jobs, as they are more profitable. 

Maybe being in my home is the issue? Maybe I should focus more on the website?

1ipqm7z,https://www.reddit.com/r/severence/comments/1ipqm7z/irving_character_analysis_gay_people/,Irving Character Analysis + Gay People,"Part of what I LOVE is that Irving seems to be on the opposite character tract as Helly - somebody whose outie has a completely different view of Lumon than the innie, and (for S1 at least) had completely different goals than the separate half of his mind. It's very funny that oIrving seems to think his innie had been secretly doing his missions and getting his messages when that doesn't seem to be the case at all - his innie only ""woke up"" because he was enchanted by the power of erotic love, then also platonic fraternity and loyalty. I don't think his innie has been doing secret missions, his outie just thinks that's the case.

Irving as a whole man seems to dedicate himself single-mindedly to a cause. On the outside, that cause is gathering intel on Lumon, communicating with his innie, literally drinking coffee and staying awake to communicate subconsciously with his innie. This is a startling level of physical dedication, much like his innie had for Lumon throughout season 1. Only when his innie is confronted with an unsanctioned erotic entanglement does he become a more complete, well-rounded person.¬†I feel that's the same journey his outie is about to go on!

I've seen people dubious of Burt's motives of inviting Irving to dinner, and to that I say:¬†*have you ever met a gay person?*¬†Every older gay male married couple I'm friends with has a much more loose definition of monogamy than hetero couples - so jot that down - but even beyond that, it's, like, just not that serious. Burt's innie was probably in love with this Irving guy. So what? Let's have dinner and figure out some information! I sorta see Burt's proposition at face value and think it's still interesting/mysterious/entertaining/fertile for the writers without having to add a super secret twist. I'll eat my shoes if I'm wrong though! 

**Irving has severed** ***himself*** **from friendship, sexuality, and pleasure. Wouldn't it be sooooooo poetic to see the same person unlock it in his brain twice?**¬†I feel like from what I've seen of John Tuturro interviews too, this is what interests him about the character. Anyways, we're sooooo back, my dudes. Gay people, we won!

**Binder - I filled with illustrators and arts I found out she thinks are beautiful or cute - plus some from my PC and childhood collection - got a 4-pocket in her favorite pastel color ü©µ 

**V day - made her coffee & presented JP BB of Surging Sparks, JP BB Terastal, ENG binder and poster PE collections, and one pack CZ, one temporal, one paradox, 2 battle partners

**Highlights

 -FIRST PACK of shuffled terastal I hand her, FIRST PACK, AGAIN, she pulls sylveon ex (very fitting for Vday, yes?)üî•üî•

 -The only smaller hit terastals she pulls are PERFECT matches for the 2 hits she already got (espeon ex and sylveon ex)‚≠êÔ∏è

 -Hisuian zoroark vstar in 1 loose pack of CZ‚≠êÔ∏è

 -Pulled a master ball! Also, in the surging sparks BB, we got 3 illustrators and more‚≠êÔ∏è

 -She is very happy & wants to check next sets for new singles for me to hunt, or couple packs to rip, to ADD TO HER NEW BINDER ü•πü•πü•π

I don't know anything about VBA.  But google says I need to use it for my intention.  I'm a custodian with an ok knowledge of excel.  I'm trying to make an automated email for each of my 14 buildings to notify me when they're running low on Ice Melter.  MS Forms records all the data I need in a worksheet.

In a separate worksheet, I have a table with 2 columns (A, the 14 buildings and B) and 14 rows.  When the ice melter gets below a certain number at a building(each building has a different threshold), column B is formatted to say ""Send Email,"" otherwise its blank.  The email needs to go to a maintenance guy with the name of the associated building.

I think I could use power automate, but if I can learn how to do this with VBA then maybe I can use this new knowledge to make alerts for other items, like coffee supplies.  Very appreciative of any help.",0,1739583021.0,excel,2,0.5,False
1ipqhs0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MtF/comments/1ipqhs0/laser_questions/,Laser questions,"So I got a round of laser done on my face a few weeks ago and besides the upper lip being utter hell like everyone always warns you about, there was a fair bit that seemed like stuff people just don't mention and I can't tell if maybe its normal or maybe the laser tech did something wrong, or maybe something about her setup just is not working for me. Also, i really figured it would feel like a heat or burn, but it feels like a sharp zap on the painful areas, not the worst, but definitely felt different than i expected.

Things I'm confused about: 
1) the whole hair just falls off thing; I had to wait like 2 full weeks (not 2 days) for any of it to be falling off with very agressive use of an exfoliating cloth and had to shave to keep the dysphoria down. 
2) now seeing a lot of blonde? Even though I have some olive undertones to my skin I'm pretty pale right now especially since its winter in Canada, and my hair has always been like coffee brown (so good contrast is what I've heard) but now im seeing hair grow in that is not anywhere near my usual shades and it's crazy light to the point that I'm worried even going somewhere else it won't be in range to zap off.

Not to say that it had no effect though, the dark patches at my chin and lips have less of that ""under the skin grey"" look after shaving, and my hair does seem to grow in sparser, so I'm happy with that but its really the lightening that I'm worried about because i am going to want ""gone"" not just reduced.

Can anyone give me a reality check here or help me understand whaty I'm seeing?

Has anyone else had the small inconvenience of scooping your coffee into a reusable k-pod only to need more than 1 scoop or maybe one scoop is just too much? Maybe it's that little pile of coffee grounds that end up on your scoop then fall to the counter top when filling your k-pod and you just made a mess for yourself to clean up first thing in the morning. Maybe you looked at other scoops that you can print and don't want to fiddle with support settings or use the extra material to make the scoop that could help expedite your morning routine. Well those are all issues I had and I decided to set out to fix those morningly inconveniences! With a beveled top, a bevel that extends from the scoop to the handle, and designing it so that it prints at a 45 degree angle it has solved all my frustrations! Even though that yes it is a simple model I have been excited about it and have given them out to some friends at work with nothing but positive feed back! One even asked me to scale it up for his espresso machine which I did and it reportedly works fantastic!

So yun na nga yes i am 39 years of age and single 

Never been married and has no kids 

I live around mandaluyong city 
Working as an Incident Management Analyst.

I usually work from home as the company that i am  affiliated with is allowing a hybrid set-up

been single for 7 long years 

So i guess it's worth taking a shot at it again.

More about me: 

I stand around 5'6 in height 

Chubby (Dad bod)

I love to watch movies (Horror)

I am a toy collector and a comic enthusiasts 

I love drinking (i don't have a any favorite spot, if there is coffee i will be there for sure.

I can cook and my signature dish is sinigang na pata 

I am a very busy guy so i would prefer chats for the time being 

I don't rush things, i would rather spend time getting to know you better.

Rather than asking you for an immediate date and be uncomfortable in person.

If you're into this kind of flow the better 

also i am not handsome and not rich 

I don't have a car

What i have is a stable job and simple life

1ipq7fi,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPD/comments/1ipq7fi/why_do_you_guys_leave_people_on_delivered_is_it/,Why do you guys leave people on delivered? Is it cause you just don‚Äôt like me?,"Would love some advice and answers here.

I was talking to this girl, ngl, she's super cute, but anyways she is the girl my ""ex"" of 1 month left me for, and treated me so bad, for.

I ended up reaching out to her, despite knowing of her existence for months, because our ""ex"" was super manipulative, toxic and abusive. Wouldn't be surprised if there was NPD.

My mind couldn't see that though and I kept falling for the manipulative games, my brain gave me no peace.

So I reached out to her, and this girl was surprised asking how do I know about her, yada yada, but she also knew about me.

So we chatted, and we were speaking about ""ex"" she had nothing nice to say about ""ex"" saying she's a compulsive liar, etc and her partner in the background also scoffed, mentioning how toxic ""ex"" is...

**Now anyways** back to the main point and question:

We were voice memo-ing back and forth for a direct hour, she invited me out to an event, but I declined. Out of sheer anxiety (which she said she relates to) but I tried to schedule for something else like coffee, etc, but she didn't really respond to that, ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è 

So anyways, I sent another voice memo since we were chatting, then she left me on delivered.

I've been on delivered for like 3-4 days, and I cannot figure out if she actively hates me (came off too strong? Overbearing maybe? Or ick)?

But what throws me off is she will watch any snap chat story I post, and all of them.

Mind you she has like 2 mill snap points. 3k IG following, her points move rapidly so that's why I also cannot comprehend why she watches my stuff. ESP when we never met, and she's leaving me on delivered.

**TL:DR**

I'm gonna guess she must think I'm gross or weird? Right?

Hey there! I‚Äôm a 30-year-old trans woman living in Phoenix, AZ, and I‚Äôm looking to connect with people who share some of my passions and interests.  

A little about me:

- **Tennis**: I‚Äôm a huge fan of tennis and love hitting the courts whenever I get the chance. Whether you‚Äôre a pro or a beginner, I‚Äôd be up for a friendly match or just chatting about the sport.  

- **Pop Music**: Pop music is my go-to, and I‚Äôm always discovering new artists and tracks. From the classics to the latest hits, I love discussing my favorite songs, albums, or going to concerts. If you're a music lover, I‚Äôm all for a good playlist swap!

- **Video Games**: Gaming is one of my favorite ways to unwind. I enjoy a mix of genres‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs strategy games, RPGs, or casual mobile games. I‚Äôm always down to talk game mechanics, tips, or just chat about the latest titles.

- **Fitness**: Staying active is really important to me, whether it's going for a run, hitting the gym, or trying out new workout routines. Fitness is a great way to stay energized and motivated, and I‚Äôd love to meet others who are into fitness, too.

- **Dogs**: I‚Äôm absolutely in love with dogs. If you have a furry friend, I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôd get along! I enjoy spending time with dogs, whether it's going for walks, playing fetch, or just relaxing with them.

- **Reading**: When I‚Äôm not being active or playing games, you can usually find me with a good book in hand. I enjoy reading all sorts of genres, from fiction to self-improvement books. I‚Äôd love to swap book recommendations or start a little book club if that sounds fun!

If you‚Äôre in the Phoenix area (or even not), and any of these things sound like something you‚Äôd be into, feel free to reach out. Whether you want to chat about our shared interests, go for a hike, grab a coffee, or something more, I‚Äôm open to connecting.

**A bit more personal**: I prefer men sexually, but if you‚Äôre a woman who‚Äôs looking for a trans friend to hang out with, you‚Äôre more than welcome to contact me too!

Looking forward to meeting new people!",0,1739582027.0,MakeNewFriendsHere,1,0.5,False

This powerful blend aids in fat burning, boosts metabolism and promotes weight loss. Get the support you need to take control of your body's transformation.

Increased Thermogenics refers to the process of heat production in the body, often associated with an increase in metabolic activity. The term is commonly used in the context of weight loss and fitness to describe supplements, foods, or activities that are believed to enhance the body‚Äôs natural ability to burn calories and produce heat.

How Thermogenics Work

Thermogenics typically work by:

Boosting Metabolism: Increasing the rate at which your body burns calories.

Enhancing Fat Oxidation: Encouraging the breakdown of fat for energy.

Increasing Energy Expenditure: Making the body work harder and expend more calories, even at rest.

Common Thermogenic Agents

Natural Substances:
Caffeine: Found in coffee, tea, and some supplements, caffeine can stimulate thermogenesis.

Capsaicin: The compound that gives chili peppers their heat; shown to temporarily increase metabolism.

Green Tea Extract: Contains catechins and caffeine that may support fat oxidation.

Ginger: A warming spice that can mildly boost calorie burn.

Exercise: Physical activity naturally raises the body‚Äôs heat production and metabolic rate.

Benefits of Thermogenics:
May support weight loss when combined with a healthy diet and regular exercise.

Can enhance energy levels and physical performance.

Some ingredients have additional health benefits, like antioxidants in green tea.

Precautions:
Thermogenic supplements can cause side effects such as increased heart rate, jitteriness, or digestive discomfort, especially in people sensitive to stimulants. 

Always consult a healthcare provider before starting thermogenic supplements, particularly if you have underlying health conditions.

Thermogenics can be a helpful tool in a comprehensive health and fitness plan, but they work best when combined with proper nutrition, exercise, and lifestyle habits.

I gave the guy super easy admin tasks like create a prospect list based on relevant ‚Äúideal client profiles‚Äù for our company.  Our ICPs are usually like Demand Generation Manager, and Marketing Manager since we are a Martech company.  Every time the guy produces a prospect list, he adds all the wrong people and titles where it seems like a joke.  He has added people with titles like Mechanical Engineer, Professors of universities and just random people.  Even worse, we are based in SF, but he adds people mostly based in third world countries like India or Bangladesh.  I also had him draft prospecting emails to prospects for me to review, which basically is just him copy and pasting my examples of emails I sent in the past but changing up 1-2 client names based on the industry sector.  We had a whole meeting where I wrote down client names to use for each sector email.  So it should be super easy.  He completely ignored my template and client examples then comes back with each email of only 2 sentences of ‚ÄúHey, have you seen the news?  Let‚Äôs chat about it over coffee!‚Äù Which I could tell he just wrote 2 sentences last minute, or used ChatGPT. And I had given him the same feedback each time for the lists and emails but he doesn‚Äôt change.  

He also started ignoring my personal slack messages to him unless I message in a groupchat with higher ups in the company.  So I started giving him feedback in the group slacks last week.  But got pulled by my manager aside and he told me that I should be nicer to the new hire and praise him more.  Which I personally find wild.  I never say anything mean like call him stupid or directly say his work is horrible but rather have made him templates and even written down instructions for him and shared with him after 1:1 zoom trainings.  The worst I ever said was that ‚ÄúI can tell he didn‚Äôt use any of the templates we made for him, but rather used ChatGPT to write prospecting messages which makes it sound super robotic‚Äù.

But Contreras could right away tell there was a connection. ‚ÄúI already know I want to spend time with you, and I want to take you to dinner,‚Äù Long remembers him saying. So they went big, with dinner at Tarpy‚Äôs Roadhouse.

Long‚Äôs bubbly, positive approach to life aligned with Contreras‚Äô more subdued, yet similarly positive attitude. They fell in love. And on Christmas of 2016, about a year after their first date, he proposed. She immediately said yes.

Right away, they began planning a wedding. Their plan was to move quickly with a small, budget-conscious wedding. Long‚Äôs mother‚Äôs health was failing, and she wanted to be married with her mom there. But then Long learned about a bureaucratic complication that would come to derail those plans. As an adult with a disability she‚Äôs had since childhood, Long qualifies for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI). It‚Äôs a benefit that some 1.1 million Americans receive.

But there‚Äôs a catch: Adults with disabilities can keep their SSDI if they remain single, or if they get married to somebody else who has a disability. If they get married to somebody who is not on SSDI, the benefit goes away.

‚ÄúWhen the man I love asked me to marry him I said yes, I was unaware that the U.S. government allows the Social Security Administration to discriminate against people with disabilities by restricting whom we can marry,‚Äù Long says.

            A true story


-To those of you who believe that Human Beings are creatures of free will, I invite you to take a trip with me back in time... when in a dream I saw a disturbing glimpse of my future. I was late for work, and no matter how hard I tried to avoid it, I ended up causing it to happen.

When I was just a 12 year old boy, before the advent of cell phones, streaming media, or even the internet for that matter, I didn‚Äôt know much about the ‚Äòparanormal‚Äô and things of that nature. No, my biggest pursuits were comic books, collecting Hot Wheels cars, and supporting my video game addiction over at the local arcade.
  
In case you're wondering how old I am, the year was 1978. Feel free to figure it out.
  
Anyway, so I got this little weekend job down at the swap meet (about two blocks from my house) helping out this old Chinese vendor named Chung. The job was simple; meet Chung at the Drive-in theater early Saturday morning to help set up his vendor stall with merchandise consisting of knock-off Gucci bags, pocketbooks, and assorted women‚Äôs shoes, then assisting him throughout the day. At the end of the day Chung would hand me a nice crispy $10.00 bill. 
  
I was making 20 bucks a week, which in 1978 afforded me the latest issues of Mad Magazine and collectible Hot Wheels, as well as a shot at that new video game over at the arcade called ‚ÄòSpace Invaders‚Äô.
  
On one Friday night I sat on the edge of my bed, reached over to my nightstand and picked up my little alarm clock to set it for work the next morning. Swap meet vendors had to be there early so that they could set up and be ready to meet the throngs of shoppers coming in at 7:00 when the ticket gates opened.
  
My alarm clock was an old vintage wind-up handed down to me from my grandmother. It had a round face and two little bells on top that would ring when the hour hand reached the third hand, (also known as the ‚Äòalarm hand‚Äô). I set the alarm hand for 5:30, wound the clock spring, and placed it back on my nightstand. I prided myself on being on time‚Ä¶a characteristic that was instilled in me from the time I learned to work for my own money.
  
I was an industrious young man of morals and integrity. I had the world by the horns‚Ä¶ or so I thought.
  
I put my pajamas on and laid my work clothes out on a chair, then tucked myself in for the night. I must have slept extremely well that night. We‚Äôre talking deep R.E.M. sleep. The kind where time seems to no longer exist. Then I had a lucid dream. A very unsettling lucid dream. It went something like this:
  
I‚Äôm walking through a door, and there, about 30 to 35 feet in front of me was my boss, Chung, squatting down in front of his vendor stall that was completely set up, with purses and handbags hanging from hooks on the shade structure. His display tables were adorned with colorful tablecloths, loaded with pocketbooks, coin purses and other accessories. 
  
He was straightening a pair of red shoes he had arranged on the tarmac up front. I had missed setup. I was suddenly flushed with the realization that I was late for work. That feeling of pure anxiety washed over me like a bucket of ice cold water.
  
I stood shocked and dumbfounded as Chung looked over his shoulder and spotted me. He nodded his head with a grin and started to speak. But the sound that came out was not that of his voice, but a loud, steady ringing sound. The sound of a bell.
  
Suddenly I was ripped from my dream, and I bolted upright in bed to the sound of my alarm clock going off. It was 5:30 and time to get ready for work. I reached over and turned it off, then rubbed my eyes, anxious with that feeling of being late that lingered with repeating visions from that stupid dream. 
  
I felt like I had just closed my eyes only to be rudely awakened again. I shrugged it off and went to the bathroom to begin my morning ritual for work. 
  
But the dream kept replaying itself over and over in my head like a 10-second video clip stuck on a loop. The finished displays. The red shoes. The grin on Chung's face. The feeling of being late. And what the hell was he about to say just before my alarm clock jolted me out of it? I just couldn‚Äôt shake it despite the fact that I had gotten up on time and there was nothing keeping me from getting to work on time that morning. 
  
Nonetheless, I picked up my pace a little bit just to make sure that dream playing out over and over again, and that feeling of dread that comes with showing up late for work, would just go away.
  
I felt a bit silly as I donned my clothes a little quicker, and tied my old suede wallabies a little faster than I normally would. I slipped my wrist watch on and checked the time against my alarm clock for a match. ‚ÄúThis is ludicrous‚Äù, I thought to myself. ‚ÄúThere's no way I can be late. If anything I‚Äôll be super early.‚Äù
  
I cut the time I would normally spend getting ready to go to work in half by skipping breakfast, and set out on foot at 10 minutes to 6 in the chilly morning darkness toward the Drive-in theater that waited for me about a block and a half away from my house. 
  
The light of dawn wouldn't break for another half-hour or so. And, as it has been all season, my job was to show up around 6:30 a.m., meet Chung at our usual spot, and we would knock out the setup by 7:00‚Ä¶just in time for the shoppers to be allowed in. 
  
But this time it would be ‚Äúa little bit different‚Äù I thought to myself as I shuffled down my empty street toward the quiet four lane thoroughfare.  Ignoring the crosswalk, I jogged across the thoroughfare toward the main gate of the Drive-in theater with its landmark fourty-foot screen looming in the distance. 
  
The dream quickened my pace. I scoffed, and fought the urge to break into a run. 
  
It was unusually foggy that morning too. As I made my way through the shadows I couldn't help but notice the ominous looking halos of swirling mist surrounding each street lamp. The theme song from ‚ÄòThe Twilight Zone‚Äô kept trying to seep into the cracks in my overactive imagination. 
  
And that damn dream. That dream was still fresh on my mind as I entered the gate and waved at the security guard leaning in the door frame of his guard shack. He recognized me with a nod of his head, his face half-lit by one single incandescent light bulb from within. He pulled the cigarette from his lips with thumb and forefinger and let out a puff of thick, gray smoke. ‚ÄúHere a little early, arencha?‚Äù 
  
I shook my head and shoved my hands in my pockets as I thought about how ridiculous it was for me to be here at this hour. There was literally no one there except for the snack bar/cafe crew in the center of the Drive-in  lot. I headed straight for it. I needed to get my head on straight. I needed a cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed donut. 
  
I walked into the cafe and up to the service counter. The place was completely empty  except for those bleary-eyed workers who were busy doing their morning prep for the coming rush of customers. ‚Äútheir day starts a lot earlier than mine‚Äù, I reckoned as I took in the aroma of fresh coffee and baked goods. 
  
I ordered my cup of coffee and an old-fashioned glazed with a $2 bill, and got two quarters change. I grabbed an AutoTrader magazine from a rack by the entrance and scanned the area for a good place to sit.
  
Through large windows I could see a panoramic view of the outside area. I spotted a booth and sat down from where I had an unobstructed view of our spot. I wanted to see Chung the moment he arrived so I could go out to greet him early. 
  
I felt so foolish as I stirred the sugar and powdered creamer into my cup, and chuckled to myself as the dream faded for now, my mind preoccupied by the taste of fresh coffee and the flavor of that old fashioned glazed delicacy. 
  
About halfway through my cup of coffee I glanced at my watch. It was 6:35 (about the time I would normally show up). By now the light of dawn was just beginning to illuminate the cloudless sky, and the fog that had invaded the early morning was gone. 
  
Vendors were rapidly arriving en masse, claiming their spots. The clinking and clanking of their shade structure poles reverberated throughout the Drive-in as the they got busy unloading their vehicles and setting up their vending stalls. 
  
Vendors began filing into the caf√© to get their morning caffeine and sugar fix. I stared blankly at our spot. Empty. Was Chung running late? I knew that his commute was considerably longer. His old cargo van had seen better days. 
  
Something was not right. The spaces on either side of ours were already busy with vendors and their helpers skillfully fastening leg poles to corner pieces, and stretching canvas tarps with bungee cords for shade.
  
I stepped outside to use the payphone that was mounted on the wall next to the restrooms. I figured I'd call Chung at home to see if he was there. But the pay phone had an ‚ÄòOut of Order‚Äô sign written in black marker taped across the coin slots. Go figure.
  
Back inside, I bought another cup of coffee with my last 50 cents. ‚ÄúWhy not?‚Äù If Chung didn‚Äôt show up by the time I finished the second cup, I reasoned, then I guess he‚Äôd be considered a no-show. 
  
Heck, I could just go home and crawl back into bed for a couple more hours before the rest of my family started to rouse. Godzilla and Kung Fu reruns on Saturday morning. Yes, just what the doctor ordered. 
  
I looked over to our spot again. It was completely vacant, surrounded by a sea of shade structures, tarps, goods, with cargo vans, box trucks, and just about anything you could haul stuff in that had materialized across the tarmac of the Drive-in theater as far as the eye could see. 
  
If you‚Äôve ever been to a swap meet you know what I'm talking about. It was now 7:00. It‚Äôs Showtime!
  
‚ÄúWell, I guess that's it‚Äù, I thought to myself as I stood up and drank the last sip from my coffee cup. Chung is a no-show. That whole dream was such a... well, it was just that‚Ä¶a dream. I was now free to go home and catch some shut eye, and to decompress from an otherwise stressful episode.
  
I headed for the exit on the other side of the now crowded cafe. Beyond it was my home less than 10 minutes away. 
  
Through the windows on that side I could see the shoppers starting to flow in from the ticket line and fan out through the isles of waiting vendors. 
  
I grabbed the doorknob and pushed it outward, and then I felt a strange rush kind of like Deja vu come over me. 
  
‚ÄúThis can‚Äôt be‚Ä¶‚Äù, I struggled to reason, as I walked out the door and saw‚Ä¶him. It was the dream. only this time, for real.
  
I gazed in existential horror at Chung who squatted about 35 feet right in front of me. He was straightening a pair of brightly polished red pumps on display on the tarmac‚Ä¶and I was late.
  
My jaw went slack as my coffee cup fell from numb fingers. ‚ÄúChung?‚Äù
  
Chung looked over his shoulder in my direction. He had just finished setting up his stall. Every detail was there from the hanging handbags to the accessory tables and, well‚Ä¶you know the rest.
  
Chung‚Äôs gaze met mine; ‚ÄúOh there you are!‚Äù He said with a sheepish grin, ‚ÄúSorry, I forgot to tell you‚Ä¶I switched spots!‚Äù

1ippw1y,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ippw1y,Jonestown Menu in 1978,"Here‚Äôs everything they ate in Jonestown, if Edith Roller is to be believed. She was pretty good at writing down their daily menu, so we get an idea of what they had for breakfast, lunch (sometimes), and dinner.

I don‚Äôt believe it was ALL rice and gravy all the time, though rice was clearly a staple in Jonestown. I think the kitchen crew did try to make the food more interesting, and Edith wrote that Jim himself said he wanted it to be ‚Äúmore varied.‚Äù

Her diary entries also hint at their food struggles, such as days when they had to work through lunch, giving the residents the opportunity to eat only two meals a day. (Unless they had snacks in between. And sometimes dinner would start pretty early at 3.)

In March, she mentions they have a new smoking oven and the residents are smoked fish. Despite this, you can tell that their resources were starting to get strained when she noted that the people couldn‚Äôt get ‚Äúa second cup of tea nowadays.‚Äù

In April, she wrote that Bea Orsot told her that there would be no coffee for several months. Rice and Gravy makes its first appearance.

At one point she felt ‚Äúconcerned‚Äù that Jim was allowing them to eat pork three times a week, and that having fried chicken and pork in one week seemed like a big deal.

One day in May, she noted that they didn‚Äôt have their usual good breakfast, and lunch was ‚Äúbare.‚Äù But the next day, they had a big dinner with roast pork.

In August she mentions that food had been good when Freed was there, and you get the sense that the kitchen workers were happy to flex their creative muscles.

1ippvoa,https://www.reddit.com/r/UrethralStrictureAid/comments/1ippvoa/venting_and_informing_urethralplasty_and/,Venting and Informing : Urethralplasty and Meatoplasty - Week 1.,"On Monday, Feb 10th I had a urethralplasty and a meatoplasty to fix my urinary strictures. The procedure started at 8 AM and I woke up in recovery around 9:45 AM. They kept me in recovery for 2 hours. My pain level was minimal; just very uncomfortable. My throat was really the only thing that bothered me painwise and that was from the intubation for the anesthetic. The original plan was to have me stay overnight but they asked me if I‚Äôd like to go home and I said yes. I don‚Äôt know if you know about the Canadian healthcare system but there‚Äôs a shortage of beds in just about every hospital. So I didn‚Äôt want to take one from someone who really needed it. They sent me home with instructions to take the catheter out on the 20th. 

I‚Äôve been at home since Monday and before today (Friday) there really hasn‚Äôt been many issues. In the first couple days I was really worried about what my penis looked like. I had a protective bandage over top to cover everything as well as a gauze cover my entire penis. They told me to take the bandages off on Tuesday; but I admit that I couldn‚Äôt stomach what I expected to see underneath. However on Wednesday when I did take it off I was extremely relieved that the only surprise was the meatoplasty which didn‚Äôt look bad at all. 

Last night I had my first troubles. I started getting a pain in my lower left abdomen. The pain was just by my left hip, in the pelvic area. I struggled to sleep until I did find a comfortable position. When I woke up I first thought I was constipated. I haven‚Äôt had a proper ‚Äúmovement‚Äù since Monday. I thought it would good have a coffee and take a shower. Once I was in the shower I noticed my left testical was swollen and tender to the touch. 

A bit of context: a couple of years ago I had an epididymitis in the same testical. At the time, they prescribed me Naproxen and Ciprofloxacin and it cleared within a day or two. Essentially it is inflammation to the epididymys at the back of the testical. Back to today, this pain felt exactly the same. I phoned my urologist and he confirmed that it‚Äôs not common but it can happen. I rushed to my family doctor and they prescribed me the same medication. 

I‚Äôm now back at home and I do feel better already. I‚Äôm sitting back watching Severance and am still uncomfortable but it‚Äôs manageable.
As for the procedure they weren‚Äôt able to repair both my structures. One of them was too deep and requires a bigger surgery which I‚Äôll have to have some time later. If you have any questions please feel free to ask. ",3,1739581038.0,UrethralStrictureAid,2,1.0,False

1ippurk,https://www.reddit.com/r/OffMyChestPH/comments/1ippurk/toxic_filipino_family/,Toxic Filipino Family,"Reader lang ako usually, but recently sobrang pagod na ko sa nararanasan ko sa family ko. Mahal ko sila, pero nakakapagod din pala.

As context, I resigned my job last October, since may konti akong naitabi na ipon I tried to rest for a month. However, namatay yung lola ko sa mother's side ko na nag-alaga sa akin nung panahong neither sa parents ko ang available dahil separated sila. Now, yung naipon kong pera is ""hiniram"" ng mother ko para gamitin para sa expenses and to make the long story short, naubos yung pera na yun. Ngayon, walang wala akong pera and I tried asking for my mom's help para may panggastos ako para sa requirements because I passed an interview. 

Kaso, it turns out to be a mistake kasi pinag-awayan lang namin yung pera. Umabot sa point na sinusumbat niya sakin yung mga kinakain ko at ginagamit kong kuryente dito sa bahay. (Yes, I am living with my mom still despite being 28 kasi hindi ko sila maiwan and I was scared of living on my own) Napakasakit marinig para sa akin yung mga binitawan niyang salita. Aminado ako, hindi ako nakakapag-abot ng malalaking halaga sa kanya at minsan may pagkukulang din sa mga nagiging expenses dahil hindi naman kalakihan ang sahod ko pero I really did try my best na maka-alleviate para sa kanila. 

Now, para akong non-existent dito sa bahay, I just stayed sa kwarto ko naghahanap ng paraan para malakad yung requirements at nagba-browse din ng iba't-ibang job hiring posts at nagbabaka-sakaling may maipasang interview na hindi gaanong marami ang requirements na dapat asikasuhin. Sa sobrang sakit nung mga sumbat, I can't even bring myself to eat dahil gastos nila to ng kinakasama niya. For the last 2 days, I've only eaten biscuit and bunch of coffees. I've decided na umalis na dito as soon as I landed a job. Please wish me luck and hopefully makasurvive.

1ippu1x,https://www.reddit.com/r/WaltDisneyWorld/comments/1ippu1x/nightmarish_trip_report_21325/,Nightmarish Trip Report 2/13/25,"My husband and I visited Walt Disney World yesterday to celebrate Valentine's Day early/take late proposal photos. He is active duty military, and we finally had the day to visit together. He hasn't been in years but I am an annual pass-holder. 

We started off with dining reservations over at the Cake Bake Shop in Disney's Boardwalk resort. Our initial reservation was supposed to be for breakfast at 9:45am but traffic conditions were terrible and made our commute a 2 hour long one instead of an hour thirty from Tampa to Orlando,

We rescheduled for 11:15pm, had lunch instead, and were pleasantly surprised by how beautiful the atmosphere was and the exceptional guest experience. 

I ordered the Summer Fruit Infusion tea for our table, a rose cappuccino, and a lemon Caesar salad with salmon added to it. The rose cappuccino was my absolute favorite drink I've ever had.

My husband ordered the gumbo soup and a lemonade, as we preferred keeping our meals relatively light and wanted to keep dinner more on the heavier side.

We took photos before leaving, as the scenery was absolutely stunning and elegant. We captured some beautiful photos with the help of the restaurant crew :-)

We headed over to Magic Kingdom where we activated my husband's park hopper day ticket before proceeding into the park. We purchased the day photopass, to capture more photos all day. We started off with the photographers at the front of the park, and made our way down, capturing beautiful photos along the way. We took a short coffee break over at Starbucks, my husband trying the new Blackberry Sage Lemonade while I grabbed an iced water. 

We were walking around for a bit, deciding what to do. Ride waits were incredibly long and unforgiving yesterday, so we opted to keep our trip relatively simple by starting with the Laughing Floor Monsters Inc show. Had a great time laughing with my husband, before we detoured to the people mover. Got some sights in, which was relaxing for us. 

We then agreed we'd head over to Space Mountain. We waited what was a 50 minute wait that realistically only felt like 30. We were approaching the first rocket you could be seated on, to our left of the line. A cast member asked how many, we said 2, and he took us off the line and put us on rows 5 and 6 for the first rocket.

I was wearing my sparkly Minnie red and white Disney bookbag, that you secure with a drawstring and velcro, and a smaller pocket at the front that zippers shut. I put my engagement ring and wedding band in the pocket that zippers, ensured they were well secured, as I didn't want to risk losing them on the ride.

As we boarded on to the ride around 3:30pm yesterday, I was in the middle of the second rocket and my husband in the back. We had a fun time, and I kept my bag leaned against my legs. 

When exiting the ride, I went to grab my rings out the bag and put them back on when I realized my engagement ring and lipstick were gone. My wallet also had been rummaged through, but nothing was taken. They left my wedding band, but we are absolutely devastated. I've been to Disney several times before, and have never had anything stolen from me.

My husband was defeated and floored, as well as I. We rushed over to find a cast member to inform them of the situation but they were unable to find anything. I'm saddened and heartbroken by this. My husband is 21, and I am 20, we worked and saved hard for that ring. 

My first and last engagement ring, a gorgeous natural diamond we invested $6000 of our savings into. We have been absolutely crushed. We were told to talk to Guest Relations who helped us fill out a report, and we spoke to the Sheriff. We were told that there are no cameras in Space Mountain for them to review and that we are basically out of luck.

The photos we took in the park earlier that day were with the ring, and in the same day, the ring was stolen. I've never felt so much grief over such an important sentimental item to us. We pray and hope whoever stole our belongings will have a change of heart and return them, but we are doubtful.

We were supposed to have dinner reservations, actually take advantage of taking more photos and park-hopping but we couldn't even move. Our assumption is whoever stole from us was watching us, as we had on our pins that indicated our special occasion visit and were dressed up.

We would never wish the same on anybody else. I wish if I could have gone back in time, I would have just kept them on my fingers instead of it potentially being on someone else's. What was supposed to be  a memorable moment of sharing our love for each other was quickly destroyed by the selfishness of another individual.

EDIT: For those confused, it was stolen while on the mini numbered line right before boarding. We had about 2 people in front of us, and I had my back turned for a minute or so before actually being able to board. We suspect that the people behind us that were being pulled from the main line stole it from the bag. ",0,1739580902.0,WaltDisneyWorld,38,0.19,False
1ippu0z,https://www.reddit.com/r/gatewaytapes/comments/1ippu0z/i_spontaneously_witnessed_a_relatives_death_24/,I spontaneously witnessed a relative's death 24 hours before it happened,"Hi guys!

Never in a million years would have thought I'd be talking about things as far fetched as astral projections, but here I am.

I have been meditating on and off for almost 2 decades now. I've done one 10-day Vipassana retreat where it's required that you remain silent and meditate for 100+ hours in 10 days. 

In the last couple of years I've folded my meditation practice into my floating practice. For those who are unfamiliar, floating provides a friction free setup for achieving higher states of consciousness by creating a sensory deprivation experience without light, sound and gravity that dissolves the boundary of reality and even your body really fast.

I normally float once a week in search of total relaxation, sleep or creative stimulation. It never really occurred to me that I could be more proactive in these deep mind states. 

Two weeks ago I went to float after a few months break and I had the most insane experience. I disappeared and flew away, time stretched and I was beyond this reality floating among the stars, watching comets pass by, I was deep in the ocean surrounded by a cloud of fish talking to a young David Lynch, and then even crazier thing happened. I suddenly found myself by the hospital bed of my grandfather sitting on the other side from grandma, holding his hand. I was able to communicate with him telepathically and we relived many childhood memories together until his body exploded with this gorgeous aurora borealis kind of iridescent green light. It was beautiful and serene, he disappeared peacefully and happy.

I woke up feeling I was away for half a day, not an hour, and convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt I just witnessed my grandpa pass away. I walked out of the float studio completely shaken. I called mom asking about grandpa (both are a continent away), everything is good she said, he's feeling better. Grandpa has been diagnosed with late stage cancer, but was in a stable condition at the hospital, expected to live a few more months. I figured I just had a strange dream and we changed subject, except while we were on the phone grandma called and said she just left the hospital and grandpa suddenly took a turn for the worse, was saying strange non sensical things and lost consciousness. He never regained consciousness and was pronounced dead 24 hours later. 

I don't think I would be doing the tapes now if I didn't experience it first, it was an absolutely insane thing to witness, and I'm still shaken.

Now I've come across Gateway project a few times over the years, but didn't have the time to look into it, thought it sounded outlandish, etc. After that grandpa vision I found the tapes again, but realised I can't do them because I lost my right earpod. I'll check them out later I figured, but somehow lost my remaining earpod the next day (I used just one for months previously). So I had to go and get a new set of headphones, which allowed me to listen to the tapes. I'm actually just connecting the dots as I type this now!

I've floated 10 hours these past two weeks, and I've reached previously unavailable depths with multiple experiences of astral projecting, OBE, lucid dreaming, etc. For a week now I can feel a powerful electric current running through my body even as I go about my days. 

I'm confused, excited and curious at the same time. As I was grinding coffee beans this morning I noticed a huge blanket with the word ""DREAM"" hanging outside of neighbours window.

Despite this, I‚Äôm a hardworking and polite person (at least, I hope people would describe me that way!). My boyfriend and I have kept our relationship a secret because telling my dad would not end well.

Recently, for my 19th birthday, my boyfriend surprised me with concert tickets to see an artist I‚Äôve adored for years. This would have been my first concert ever, and my best friend and her sister also got tickets, so we would‚Äôve gone together. I was beyond excited thinking this day was shaping itself to have been the best of my life! Honestly, thinking about the concert was the one thing motivating me to push through my tough university semester.

However, I just found out that my summer courses are full-term, meaning I‚Äôll have class the morning after the concert. My dad would never let me go out that late before school, so now my chances of going are basically zero. I was really upset when I told my boyfriend, and at first, he kept reassuring me that we‚Äôd find a way. But then, just a few minutes later, he said, *‚ÄúYou know what? It‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll just go!‚Äù*

That caught me off guard because he originally bought one ticket‚Äîfor me. He isn‚Äôt even a fan of this artist and probably couldn‚Äôt name a single song and he didn't know of her until I mentioned the concert announcement to him last year. There‚Äôs also an option to resell the ticket for a higher price since it‚Äôs a sold-out show, but instead, he started getting excited about going himself. And to put the cherry on the cake he would be going with my best friend to whom he is close with and her sister, which just made me feel‚Ä¶ a little jealous and left out :(

I know it‚Äôs not his fault I can‚Äôt go, and I get that it could be a fun experience for him, but something about how quickly he jumped to go to the concert hurt. It felt like a reminder of  the times I‚Äôve had to miss out on things because of my strict parents. I didn‚Äôt say anything, but my mood definitely dropped, and I started being distant and blunt with him. He clearly tried to lift my mood seemingly unaware of why I was upset but I was pretty unpleasant and felt extra worse when I got home since it's Valentines day and I didn't want to ruin that. Would I be the A-hole if I brought it up to him? and am I one for acting this way?

Edit:::: Oh damn, this post has only been up for an hour, and the comments are brutalüòÖBut I appreciate the honesty, so thank you for that. I just wanted to clarify a few things:

	1.	I‚Äôm not upset about him going to the concert or even saying, ‚ÄúOh, I could go.‚Äù That‚Äôs fine. What got to me was how instant it was‚Äîlike, I had barely processed the fact that I couldn‚Äôt go, and we didn‚Äôt even take a moment to think through any alternatives before he immediately said, ‚ÄúI‚Äôll go then.‚Äù It just felt so sudden, like I didn‚Äôt even have a chance to explore if there was any way I could still go.

To give more context, at first, I was 100% sure I could go. Then, as I started hearing things from my peers about summer schedules, I had a few doubts. During that time, we joked about it‚Äîat one point, I even laughed and told him he should take pictures at the concert and make it look like I was thereü§£ But that was just me joking around, before I actually knew for sure that I couldn‚Äôt go.

So when I finally found out that I really couldn‚Äôt go, I was obviously upset because this was a huge deal to me. And the moment I told him, his response was instantly, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs fine, I‚Äôll go.‚Äù I get it‚Äîof course he should still go, and I never wanted to stop him. But in that moment, it felt like a snap reaction, like my last bit of hope that maybe I‚Äôd find a way to make it work was just gone in an instant. I was hoping we‚Äôd at least give it some time‚Äîmaybe a month‚Äîto see if anything could change. Instead, it felt like the door just slammed shut right away, and that‚Äôs what made me sad.

To be clear, I wasn‚Äôt upset because he wanted to go‚ÄîI was upset because of how fast it all happened, and I just kind of shut down emotionally. That‚Äôs why I was asking if I should talk to him about why I acted that way and apologize for it, not because I wanted to convince him not to go. I just wanted to make that part very clear. Sorry I wasn‚Äôt very clear with that tbh. 

	2.	About reselling‚Äîthis is my first concert, and I genuinely thought it would be simple. The app listed it as an option, and from what I had heard, since the tickets were in such high demand, I figured it would be easy to sell for even more than face value. I didn‚Äôt realize how tricky reselling could actually be. I apologize for my ignorance there.
	3.	The way I wrote it made it sound like my boyfriend, my best friend, and her sister are some tight-knit friend group. That‚Äôs not the case. They‚Äôre comfortable around each other, but it‚Äôs not like they would ever go grab a coffee or hang out one-on-one. It‚Äôs more of a ‚Äúyour partner‚Äôs friend that you‚Äôre cool with‚Äù situation, where you‚Äôll chat if you‚Äôre all in the same space, but that‚Äôs about it. I honestly don‚Äôt know what this. Rings to the table in terms of additional information üòÖ but I just wanted to put that out there.
	4.	And lastly, yes, I‚Äôm 19, and on paper, that means I‚Äôm an adult. But life is complicated, and not everyone has full control over their circumstances just because of their age. Some of the comments assuming I should just ‚Äústand up for myself‚Äù or ‚Äúmove out‚Äù are honestly ridiculous. Not everyone‚Äôs situation is that simple, and it‚Äôs kind of idiotic to act like it is.

5. Also yes I am not completely mature yet I know that üôÑ I am still learning and he is also my first relationship so the folks who were all huffing and puffing in the comments. Take a breather I beg üôèüèæ

6. 
Also, just to clarify‚ÄîI wasn‚Äôt mean to him or acted necessarily ‚Äúunpleasant‚Äù. I only worded it that way originally because I needed to for the AITAH post to post, many times my wording never met criteria ü•π honestly I was asking for advice. We still had a decent time. We were talking, playing video games on our phones together, and things were generally okay. It‚Äôs just that my mood did drop, and I kind of shut down emotionally.

I‚Äôll be honest‚ÄîI‚Äôm not emotionally mature enough to process my feelings in the moment. My usual reaction to disappointment is to withdraw a little, distance myself from whatever is making me feel that way, process it, and then address it later. So I wasn‚Äôt ignoring him, I wasn‚Äôt cold, and I wasn‚Äôt trying to make him feel bad‚ÄîI was just noticeably less energetic than usual. He caught on and asked if I was okay a couple of times, but I kept saying I was fine, even though it was obvious my energy had dipped.


Anyway, just wanted to clear those things up. Thanks to those who actually gave thoughtful responses! Ooh damn this is a lot anyone who read this all.. I command you ü´°",6,1739580829.0,AITAH,46,0.67,False

1ippr7u,https://www.reddit.com/r/SexualAbuseSurvivors/comments/1ippr7u/raped_by_my_manager/,Raped by my manager,"Going to start this with a trigger warning. There‚Äôs a lot of sexual abuse involved. Please read with caution. 

In my early 20s I started working at a restaurant. I loved that place, I felt at home. I made really good friends with my manager, let‚Äôs call him Cee, who was much much older than me but I didn‚Äôt see it as a problem because I‚Äôve always tended to have older friends. Two months into working there I was sexually assaulted by one of the servers. I reported it to the owner but nothing really came of it. Cee was very protective of me and told me it wouldn‚Äôt happen again under his watch. I really trusted him and looked up to him  as a sort of father figure. 

Cee and I would spend time together outside of work. We‚Äôd go out after, he‚Äôd give me a ride when my car wasn‚Äôt working, getting coffee, casual stuff that I never saw a problem with. I was going through a lot in life and Cee became 
my best and only friend. 

Fast forward to years and he invites me to his house after work. I honestly don‚Äôt see an issue with it because he‚Äôs never done anything before, also I was young and na√Øve. We get there and no one his home, his wife is away. Just us, his dogs and a bottle of gin he stole from the restaurant, which I was not aware of until we sat down in the living room. 

We were talking,watching a movie, Cee was pouring me drink after drink after drink. Everything was normal until it wasn‚Äôt. Out of nowhere he asks me ‚Äúso, when do I get to kiss you?‚Äù And I froze. I asked him if he was serious and he nods. I told him we couldn‚Äôt do that. That‚Äôs he‚Äôs my best friend, that I didn‚Äôt want that. I kept drinking because I was so uncomfortable. The next thing I knew I was opening my eyes and it was morning, I was still at the house. Cee was asleep next to me and my pants are on the floor. I start freaking out. Cee wakes up and tells me to calm down, it‚Äôs not a big deal, not to worry. I tell him I have to go. I get to my car and race home. 

I see him later at work. He comes up to me, smiling, and my heart is racing. Palms sweating. ‚ÄúI really need to talk to you‚Äù I tell him. He laughed and whispered ‚ÄúI raped you‚Äù and walks away. 

He violated me many, many more times over the course of 8 months, until we both left that job. I didn‚Äôt say anything for six years because I couldn‚Äôt believe someone I loved and trusted so much would do such an ugly thing to me. He told me he was sorry and it wouldn‚Äôt happen again but it did. I had no one else at the time and he knew it. I look back now and realize how badly he took advantage of me and I‚Äôm so embarrassed. I feel so dirty, disgusting and wrong. 

I don‚Äôt even know how to start unpacking this. I told my spouse finally what happened thinking I would feel better, but honestly I feel worse. Maybe I should‚Äôve just continued to hide.

I accepted, and the day after, we drank coffee and got to know each other more. For context, we're in the same club and a part of a smaller group within that club.  We've been in that same group since near the beginning of the last semester, I also sit next to him when our group meets once a week and are mostly just acquaintances. I don't want to be too specific, because the thought of him possibly seeing this and knowing this is about him and linking this back to me makes me cringe.  


He asked me very abruptly in the evening on Discord, I was taken off-guard because I had never been asked to hang out with anyone before. I only talked to him once briefly outside of the club, but it was just a single question.   


(I don't have any friends currently, due to my social anxiety, which I've been working towards with my counselor. The one time I talked to him outside of our club was because my counselor encouraged me to help with my social anxiety.)   


I agreed to hang out, and the next day we met up to drink coffee together. We mostly got to know each other more, mainly throwing questions at each other and responding to those questions. I found out that we have quite a bit in common, like interests, hobbies, the same major, etc. We talked for an hour and it was pleasant. He was polite and genuine. It never seemed like he wanted something out of me, nor does he even seem like that type of person.  


After it ended, I've been happy since, not only have I actually talked to someone and it went well. But because we have quite a bit in common from what it seems. For the last 24 hours, I've been really wanting and thinking of ways to build this relationship and possibly be friends. But I'm not sure how, since I don't want to come across as desperate, annoying, or clingy.   
To be honest, I don't know why he asked to hang out, and very suddenly at that. It's not lost on me that he asked during the week of Valentine's Day. I'm not sure if he has a crush on me or just genuinely wants to maybe be friends with me, I can't really tell. I came to the conclusion that he's just curious about me, and maybe at the very least, wants to be friends with me. Since this was the first time we truly talked to one another before. I don't want to or think it's right to assume how he feels about me because I have no clue.

Anyway, my main question is what should I try and do to build that relationship? I'm thinking of possibly waiting until next weekend when we'll meet again at our club, and maybe ask him if he wants to hang out again during the week. I've thought of a couple of options like eating lunch or dinner on campus and studying/ doing homework together. It's very cold where I am, so my options are quite low.

this is very rambly as I want to get this thought out of my head but I really want to try, especially after talking with my counselor numerous times about my social anxiety and feelings of loneliness in general.

TLDR: I (18F) want to build a friendship with a guy (18-19M) from my club. Especially now after he asked to hang out suddenly, and ended up having a very pleasant time getting to know each other, and going well overall. I want to try to hang out with him more and get to know him more, to build a possible friendship.",0,1739580380.0,relationships,1,0.5,False

For one moment you are happy and in another, desperate. Emma feels scared when she is in a good mood, she feels like something bad is going to happen soon.

She was turning left and right while sleeping, something was tormenting her. Finding herself at the beach having fun with her family. Her son Noah was smiling and laughing chasing the waves. All of a sudden, the ocean was going backward. Freaking out from what was going to happen, with her mouth wide open she screamed from the deepest of her lungs: ""Noah, run as fast as you can towards the hills! Run, Noah Run!"" The ocean turned into a gigantic tsunami ready to wipe out everything in his way. Noah for a moment was there, and then she lost him from her sight. Evan was there too, but where was he?

Those violent and furious waves took away umbrellas, a bit further, a car, and then flooded a building nearby. The waves' noise was so loud that she had to cover her ears to survive being deaf. The feeling that she couldn't do anything to stop this left her numb and paralyzed for a second. Then she started to run again, turned her head back to sick for Noah...The waves were still behind her, so close and ready to catch her...

Then she felt a warm kiss on her chick, trying to open her heavy eyes she saw Evan. Was that a dream? Thank Goodness it was. When she saw his smile, her heart felt relieved. Trying to move the blankets, she stood up at her bed for some moments and then went towards the bathroom. When she was out her husband had already prepared the expresso coffee. She liked it with no sugar cream and that was just perfect. They usually loved to talk for an hour on that coffee and discuss different things on their way.

That day was just any other day, making ready her son for school. Snacks check, water bottle check, and backpack check. Everything was ready for school. After that, Emma would start cleaning, cooking, and studying at the same time. She was not an obsessed cleaning type. A house is not a hotel she said, so it should not be always in order and shiny.

Checking the time on her phone, saw that was almost time to pick up Noah. Getting ready to go out, she had a sudden call from her husband:

""Hunny, can you please pick me up from my mom's house? I need to change the cars.""

At first, she agreed but walking outside in the parking area, saw that everything was surrounded by ice. Even though stepping one step at a time she almost slipped. Her car was covered everywhere with ice, above and underneath. In this situation, she could not dare to pull it out, not alone. So, she had to ask Evan for help.

And there he was, pulling the car out without any problem. He loved to brag about his driving skills and repeated that to everyone 'I am not a cartoon driver'. When she was good to go, saw that there was no more time left to give him a ride. With a sad face and feeling sorry she turned around and said:

‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry, but you should have told me earlier about this; now it‚Äôs too late to pick up Noah. I have to go,‚Äù she spoke in a hurry. Then she jumped towards the car to sit in the driver‚Äôs seat. It was a bit high for her; she always had to jump to reach it. That jump made her always laugh at herself.

Evan, on the other hand, was getting ready for work. He shaved and dressed. For him, appearance was a big deal, and took that very seriously. He wore skinny blue dark jeans, a shirt, and some not-too-sporty sneakers. Of course, he could not forget to take also a shower before going to work. Emma always thought that he took so much care of himself just to be at the center of attention.

Driving carefully, suddenly, she heard strange sounds on her phone. Realizing then that she might have forgotten to close the call with her husband. Despite that, she decided to listen more. Having a feeling, that something was going to happen. At the same time, paying attention to the long line of parent pick-up. As they were ten more minutes before the dismissal, she put the car in the parking march and waited.

In the waiting silence, Emma heard on that call a screaming corny voice, definitely a woman's voice. It did not stop; it was loudly and repeatedly. Her breathing paused for a second, trying to understand what was happening. A lot of questions attacked her at the same time; 'Was he cheating or what? What was he doing? With whom was he?' Oh, no!

Trying to wake herself up, thinking it was a nightmare, she shook her head. Of course, she was going crazy, her mind was playing tricks on her. Breathing too fast, her hands were shaking, and her stomach was like someone had just punched her right through it.

Not sure what to do she rolled her eyes from left to right, having a messed-up feeling. Biting nervously her lips, she hung up and called back. Well, she needed an explanation a reason or something. But Evan was taking a long time to pick up the phone and answer. 'Of course, he had so much better to do.' thinking ironically. Losing control of her emotions, Emma wished to never have witnessed that, but yet she did.

‚ÄúWhy were you not answering? With whom are you right now? What the heck are you doing? Answer me!‚Äù screaming all of these interrogative questions in one single breath.

‚ÄúI am at home exactly where you left me!"" he spoke like nothing had happened as if everything was just normal.

‚ÄúDo you think I am stupid or what? Stop pretending you piece of sh...! I heard you on the phone. Who is there with you? I heard that b... screaming. I hate you; I hate you. Do not talk to me ever again. I am so sick and tired of this.

And his answer was as simple as that; 'It was just a movie playing on the TV.'

Oh, she was mad, so mad that she had to hang up the phone. Followed, by a short and angry message sent to him, 'I do not want to see or hear anything from you!'

Looking out the window, with one hand on her chest and the other one on the wheel. A panic attack took her over and couldn‚Äôt catch her breath. With her hands shivering, opened the left window of the driver‚Äôs side to get some fresh air; It was getting too hot in there. Putting her head outside of the window for some seconds helped her a little bit.

She wanted so much to scream and let all her pain out but, there were a lot of cars close to her. Emma knew that in a few minutes, she was going to be with her son. He was so young and innocent, she was the luckiest mom in the world having such a beautiful gift in her life. Thinking about that was ready to fake a smile. However, every time she smiled, felt like losing some pieces of her. She had to be strong, for him. 'Calm yourself, Emma! Come on! You can do it. A few more minutes than you can let the scream out.' she encouraged herself.

Emma saw that Noah was coming slowly, towards the car. Taking one step at a time as the sidewalk was icy. That day he was wearing a black Adidas tracksuit and a warm coat. Carefully opened the car's back door and hopped inside.

‚ÄúGood afternoon sweety! Buckle up, please. How was school today?‚Äù Trying to start a conversation with him.

At that time, Evan called a hundred times and sent a lot of messages on the phone. Not surprisingly, none of them was read or answered by Emma. Seeing herself in that kind of situation more than once, felt so exhausted.

As soon as they were home, she set the table and went to lock herself in the bathroom. Leaned against the wall, placed her hands on her head then sat down on the cold tiles. Letting out a silent scream; as she could not make herself heard, her soul was crying on the inside. Strangely, though no tears came out; no, for a reason she couldn‚Äôt cry.
