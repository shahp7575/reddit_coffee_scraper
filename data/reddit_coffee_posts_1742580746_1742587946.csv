I’ve also recently found out that my friends text each other more regularly than I can manage, for example, I saw one of my friends send a funny selfie about how he spilled coffee on his shirt, or another example, one of my friends went on a video call with another friend to ask what outfit he should wear for a relatively normal night out. I never feel a need to do that and I think I would find it rather exhausting but I’m afraid it’s going to hurt my relationships in the long run. I just can’t bring myself to be bubbly and constantly sharing what’s going on in my life or chatting with people about what to do.

Hope everyone’s having a fantastic Friday.** ☕️

Since the last piece I shared here got some positive feedback, I figured it was only natural to share my latest: a deep-dive into understanding procrastination.

As we all know, procrastination is the killer of productivity. In this in-depth article, we’ll explore:

* Why we procrastinate in the first place
* The deeper forces behind habitual avoidance
* Which common strategies actually work (and which ones quietly backfire)
* And how to stop reinforcing the habit—even when you feel stuck in it

Put simply: we’ll break down expert opinions, my evolving feelings about doing the dishes, the strategies that work (or don’t), and the *real* reason behind procrastination.

If you haven’t already, top off your coffee and settle in—this one’s a long read. What started as a brief look at procrastination turned into something closer to a definitive guide. I sincerely hope you enjoy the piece and find something useful in it.

In the aftermath of Cooper's fateful decision, Earth continues to deteriorate under relentless dust storms and crop failures. Despite technological advancements, humanity teeters on the brink of extinction, clinging to the hope that Cooper's sacrifice might yet bear fruit.

Murph Cooper has emerged as humanity's guiding light, leveraging the quantum data her father transmitted from within the black hole to spearhead unprecedented scientific breakthroughs. Though she's become the face of human resilience, she remains emotionally conflicted—never fully reconciling with her father's abandonment while acknowledging his role in Earth's salvation. The question that haunts her: Did he truly perish, or is he somewhere among the stars?

Across the cosmos, Dr. Brand struggles to establish humanity's foothold on Edmunds' planet. The harsh environment proves more formidable than anticipated, and isolation weighs heavily on her spirit. Nevertheless, she perseveres, maintaining the colony while scanning the void for any trace of Cooper or solutions to secure their precarious existence.

# The Signal

The universe shifts when an anomalous signal penetrates Earth's communication systems—a complex binary transmission that defies conventional analysis. Murph, applying her unparalleled scientific acumen, gradually deciphers the code to reveal an astonishing truth: the message appears to originate from Cooper himself, emanating from the vicinity of Gargantua, the supermassive black hole he entered years before.

The transmission contains precise coordinates to an unexplored galaxy, along with quantum equations suggesting the existence of a stable wormhole—potentially humanity's pathway to salvation. Spectral analysis confirms the signal's origin from within the event horizon of Gargantua, challenging fundamental physics and suggesting Cooper has discovered something transformative about spacetime itself.

The Quantum Dilemma

Murph convenes a council of Earth's remaining scientific minds to analyze the message's implications. The data indicates Cooper may have discovered a quantum realm where consciousness can transcend conventional physical limitations—a dimension where time flows differently and information can travel backward through gravitational waves.

The council is divided: some believe the message represents humanity's last hope, while others warn it could be a gravitational mirage—a false signal generated by the black hole's extreme physics. Murph, however, recognizes patterns in the code that only her father would know—childhood references and mathematical signatures unique to their relationship.

# The New Mission

NASA, now under Murph's direction, initiates ""Project Quantum Horizon""—a mission to follow Cooper's coordinates using revolutionary propulsion technology developed from the quantum data he provided years earlier. The stakes couldn't be higher: Earth's atmosphere has begun to lose oxygen at an accelerated rate, giving humanity less than a decade before global asphyxiation.

The mission requires a new generation of explorers with specialized quantum physics training. Leading the team is Dr. Ellie Cooper, Murph's brilliant daughter who inherited her grandfather's intuitive understanding of physics and her mother's analytical precision. The crew includes quantum physicist Dr. Takumi Sato, whose theories on consciousness transfer across spacetime dimensions revolutionized physics; Commander Maya Ramirez, a veteran pilot with unmatched experience navigating gravitational anomalies; and AI specialist Dr. Julian Chen, who developed quantum computing systems capable of processing information across temporal dimensions.

Their spacecraft, the Endurance II, incorporates technology reverse-engineered from the signal itself—a quantum navigation system theoretically capable of traversing the black hole's event horizon without destruction.

The Temporal Bridge

As the mission launches, Murph makes a startling discovery in the final segments of Cooper's message: coordinates to a location on Earth containing a hidden quantum transmitter—a device Cooper somehow placed there from across the universe. This ""temporal bridge"" could potentially maintain communication with the Endurance II even as it ventures beyond conventional spacetime.

The revelation forces Murph to confront the possibility that her father might exist in a state beyond traditional life or death—perhaps as a quantum consciousness traversing dimensions, seeking to guide humanity toward a future that transcends their current understanding of existence itself.

With Earth's clock ticking down and the Endurance II accelerating toward the coordinates, humanity stands at the threshold of either extinction or evolution—a quantum horizon where the very nature of reality and consciousness may be redefined by what awaits in the darkness beyond Gargantua.

  


Interstellar 2: Act 2 – The New CrewAn Extended and Epic Narrative

Murph Cooper, now a seasoned scientist and a symbol of hope for a struggling humanity, stands at the precipice of a decision that will define not only her legacy but the fate of all mankind. The weight of her father’s absence has haunted her for decades, but the mysterious signal—a faint, pulsating echo from the depths of space—has reignited a spark within her. It is a spark of curiosity, of defiance, and of hope. Though the idea of confronting her father’s legacy fills her with trepidation, she knows that inaction is no longer an option. The Earth Federation, recognizing the urgency of the situation, grants her the resources and authority to assemble a team capable of undertaking the most daring mission in human history.

The mission is clear: follow the coordinates of the enigmatic signal, uncover its origins, and, if possible, bring back Cooper—or at least the knowledge he may possess. The stakes are nothing less than the survival of humanity. Earth’s resources are dwindling, its atmosphere is deteriorating, and the remnants of civilization cling to the hope that somewhere, out there, lies the key to their salvation.

Murph’s team is a carefully curated ensemble of the brightest minds and most skilled individuals humanity has to offer. Each member brings a unique set of skills and a shared determination to succeed where others have failed.

Dr. Elena Rhee, a prodigious quantum physicist, is the first to join the crew. Her groundbreaking work on quantum entanglement and spacetime anomalies has revolutionized humanity’s understanding of the universe. Her sharp intellect and unyielding curiosity make her the perfect candidate to unravel the mysteries of the signal and the wormhole. However, beneath her stoic exterior lies a deep-seated fear of the unknown, a fear she must confront as they venture into uncharted territory.

Commander Alex Munoz, a young but exceptionally talented astronaut, is the team’s pilot and navigator. His natural aptitude for maneuvering spacecraft in the most treacherous conditions has earned him a reputation as one of the best in his field. Idealistic and fiercely loyal, Alex views the mission as more than just a scientific endeavor—it is a chance to prove that humanity’s spirit of exploration and resilience can overcome even the greatest challenges.

Dr. Lucas Forrester, an expert in artificial intelligence and robotics, rounds out the crew. His expertise in decoding alien technology and interfacing with advanced AI systems will be crucial as they navigate the wormhole and encounter whatever lies beyond. Lucas is a pragmatist, often clashing with Alex’s idealism, but his unwavering focus on the mission’s objectives ensures that the team remains grounded in the face of uncertainty.

Together, they form a formidable team, united by a common purpose but driven by their own personal motivations. As they prepare for the journey, the Earth Federation spares no expense in equipping their spacecraft, the Odyssey II, with the latest advancements in propulsion, communication, and life support systems. The ship is a marvel of human ingenuity, designed to withstand the rigors of deep space travel and the unknown dangers that await them.

The day of the launch arrives, and the atmosphere at the spaceport is charged with a mixture of anticipation and dread. Families, friends, and colleagues gather to bid farewell to the crew, knowing that this mission may be humanity’s last hope. Murph, standing at the forefront of the team, delivers an emotional farewell speech. Her voice trembles with the weight of her words as she addresses the crowd.

“We stand on the brink of the unknown,” she begins, her eyes scanning the faces of those she may never see again. “This mission is not just about science or exploration. It is about survival. It is about proving that even in the face of insurmountable odds, humanity can rise to the challenge. We don’t know what we’ll find out there, but we are the last hope. Make it count.”

Her words resonate deeply with the crew and the onlookers alike, a rallying cry that echoes through the hearts of all who hear it. As the final preparations are completed, Murph takes a moment to herself, gazing at the Earth one last time. The planet, once vibrant and teeming with life, now bears the scars of humanity’s mistakes. It is a poignant reminder of what they are fighting for.

With a deep breath, she boards the Odyssey II, joining her crewmates as they take their positions. The countdown begins, and the tension in the cabin is palpable. As the engines roar to life and the ship ascends into the heavens, a sense of awe and determination fills the air. For the first time in decades, humanity dares to look beyond the stars, to venture into the unknown in search of answers—and perhaps, redemption.

The journey through the wormhole is both exhilarating and terrifying. The familiar laws of physics seem to bend and twist as the ship is propelled through the cosmic gateway. The crew experiences a surreal sensation of being stretched and compressed, their senses overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the phenomenon. Dr. Rhee monitors the quantum fluctuations with rapt attention, while Commander Munoz expertly steers the ship through the turbulent passage. Dr. Forrester remains focused on the AI systems, ensuring that the ship’s integrity remains intact.

As they emerge on the other side, the crew is greeted by a sight that takes their breath away. A distant galaxy, shimmering with countless stars and nebulae, stretches out before them. The beauty of the cosmos is both humbling and inspiring, a reminder of the vastness of the universe and the insignificance of their own struggles.

But their awe is short-lived. The coordinates of the signal lead them to a mysterious planet, its surface shrouded in an eerie, otherworldly glow. As they approach, the crew begins to detect strange energy readings and signs of advanced technology. It becomes clear that this is no ordinary planet—it is a place where the laws of nature seem to have been rewritten, a place that holds the key to the signal’s origins and, perhaps, the fate of humanity.

As they prepare to land, Murph feels a surge of emotions—fear, excitement, and a glimmer of hope. She knows that the challenges ahead will test them in ways they cannot yet imagine. But she also knows that they are humanity’s last hope, and that failure is not an option.

The Odyssey II descends toward the planet’s surface, its engines humming with anticipation. The crew braces themselves for what lies ahead, united by their shared purpose and the unshakable belief that they can make a difference.

The journey has only just begun.

  


ACT 3: BEYOND THE EVENT HORIZON

The new Endurance II launches, utilizing technology derived from the quantum data Cooper sent back. The ship is capable of creating temporary wormholes, allowing them to travel vast distances without the decades-long sleep that the original mission required. Their journey takes them back to the remains of the Endurance station near Saturn, where they discover that the wormhole has changed—pulsating with new energy patterns that defy conventional physics.

As they approach, TARS 2.0 detects a faint transmission coming from Dr. Brand's colony. The message is fragmented but reveals that Brand has made a breakthrough: the planet's hostile environment isn't natural but engineered. Something or someone has been terraforming Edmunds, making it increasingly inhospitable to human life.

The crew debates whether to divert to Edmunds first or follow Cooper's coordinates directly. Tom Jr. insists they stay on course—his grandfather's message is their priority. Dr. Zhang agrees, theorizing that whatever is happening on Edmunds might be connected to Cooper's disappearance.

They enter the wormhole, but unlike the smooth passage of the first mission, this journey is violent and disorienting. The ship is bombarded with quantum fluctuations that cause time to stretch and compress around them. Each crew member experiences visions—glimpses of possible futures and alternate pasts. Tom Jr. sees his grandfather in the tesseract, trying desperately to communicate something new.

When they emerge, they find themselves not near Gargantua as expected, but in an entirely unfamiliar system. Three planets orbit a neutron star, each exhibiting signs of advanced civilization but no detectable life forms. TARS 2.0 identifies one planet as the source of Cooper's signal.

The descent to the surface is treacherous—the neutron star's gravity warps their trajectory, forcing pilot Commander Rodriguez to execute a series of dangerous maneuvers. The ship's hull groans under the strain, systems flickering as reality itself seems to bend around them. Dr. Kapoor, their physicist, frantically works to recalibrate the gravitational sensors, her fingers flying across holographic displays that distort with each gravitational wave.

""We're experiencing time dilation even before landing,"" she announces, her voice tight. ""One hour here will cost us three days relative to Earth.""

Tom Jr. stares at the swirling atmosphere below them. ""Doesn't matter. We've come too far to turn back now.""

They land on a vast plain of crystalline structures that seem to pulse with internal light. The horizon curves sharply upward due to the intense gravity, creating the unsettling illusion of being at the bottom of a massive bowl. Scattered across the landscape are massive geometric structures—perfect dodecahedrons and impossible Penrose triangles materialized in gleaming obsidian material that absorbs light rather than reflects it.

TARS 2.0 activates the ship's external sensors. ""I'm detecting quantum signatures similar to those recorded in the tesseract. This civilization, if we can call it that, appears to exist partly outside our dimensional constraints.""

""Like the bulk beings that helped my grandfather?"" Tom Jr. asks, pressing his palm against the viewport.

""More advanced,"" Zhang replies, studying the readouts. ""These structures aren't just manipulating gravity—they're manipulating probability itself.""

The team prepares for EVA, donning next-generation suits equipped with quantum stabilizers designed to maintain their physical integrity in case of dimensional fluctuations. As they step onto the surface, their perceptions immediately begin to fracture. Each crew member experiences the environment differently—Rodriguez sees a lush jungle where Kapoor sees a crystalline desert. Only Tom Jr., carrying Cooper's watch—the same one used to transmit the quantum data decades ago—perceives what seems to be the objective reality.

""Focus on me,"" he instructs the team. ""The watch is acting as some kind of anchor.""

They follow a signal to one of the massive structures. Inside, they discover what appears to be a vast library—but instead of books, it contains spheres of light that, when touched, transmit entire lifetimes of memory and knowledge directly into their consciousness. Tom Jr. finds one sphere glowing with a distinctive blue light that matches the color of Earth's sky.

When he touches it, Cooper's consciousness floods into him. Not memories, but his actual consciousness, preserved somehow in this extradimensional medium. Tom Jr. collapses, his mind struggling to contain two separate identities.

""They didn't just help me,"" Cooper's voice emerges from Tom Jr.'s mouth, his mannerisms suddenly matching his grandfather's. ""They've been studying us. Humanity is an experiment to them—a species capable of transcending dimensional constraints through love and connection. That's why the coordinates led here. Not for rescue, but for warning.""

Rodriguez steadies Tom Jr./Cooper as he struggles to his feet. ""Warning about what?""

""Brand's discovery was right, but incomplete. The beings that built this place—that created the wormhole—they're terraforming planets across the galaxy, reshaping them to their preferred physics. Earth is next. They've been manipulating our evolution for millennia, guiding us toward dimensional awareness. The gravity anomalies, the blight—all tests to accelerate our development.""

Dr. Zhang approaches a central pedestal where a pulsating orb hovers, rhythmically expanding and contracting like a beating heart. ""Is this their technology?""

""It's them,"" Cooper/Tom Jr. responds. ""Not their technology—their physical form exists as quantum probability distributions. They don't build machines; they reshape reality itself.""

Kapoor's suit sensors begin wailing. ""Something's happening. The quantum fluctuations are intensifying.""

The structure around them begins to shift, walls becoming transparent, revealing thousands of similar buildings across the landscape, all pulsing in perfect synchronization. Through the now-translucent ceiling, they can see the neutron star above flaring with impossible colors that extend beyond the visible spectrum.

""They're aware of us now,"" Cooper/Tom Jr. says. ""And they're accelerating their timeline.""

TARS 2.0, who remained connected to the ship, transmits an urgent message: ""The wormhole is collapsing. We have eighteen hours before our return path disappears completely.""

But Cooper/Tom Jr. moves toward the central orb, hand outstretched. ""There's another way. Brand found it too late. The colonies were never meant to be humanity's salvation—they were observation posts. But she discovered how to manipulate their technology.""

His fingers touch the orb, and the entire structure shudders. Images flood the air around them—Brand fighting against increasingly hostile conditions on Edmunds, using salvaged equipment to decode the planet's changing patterns, discovering that the changes weren't random but encrypted information. Her final transmission shows her creating a device that interferes with the terraforming process.

""She found a way to communicate with them directly,"" Cooper/Tom Jr. explains. ""Not just observe, but engage. She was trying to negotiate.""

Rodriguez checks her equipment. ""We need to decide now. Eighteen hours until the wormhole collapses.""

""It won't just be the wormhole,"" Cooper/Tom Jr. says grimly. ""Their experiments are concluding. The same technology that's making Edmunds inhospitable is already deployed on Earth. The gravitational anomalies were just the beginning.""

Dr. Zhang studies the data streaming through his helmet display. ""These beings exist outside linear time. If we can use their technology—adapt Brand's research—we might be able to send a message back. Not just to a specific time, like Cooper did from the tesseract, but to all times simultaneously.""

""A quantum broadcast,"" Kapoor nods, understanding. ""Collapse all possible outcomes into one where we succeed.""

""It would require an anchor point,"" Cooper/Tom Jr. says, looking down at the watch on his wrist. ""Something connected to both worlds.""

The team works frantically, combining their understanding of the quantum data Cooper originally sent with Brand's research and the new insights gained from the alien library. They construct a device using components from their suits and materials from the structure itself—a hybrid of human ingenuity and bulk being technology.

As they work, the merging of Cooper and Tom Jr. becomes more complete—two generations of knowledge and determination fused into one consciousness. The structure around them continues to transform, sometimes expanding to seemingly infinite proportions, sometimes contracting until they feel squeezed between dimensions.

""The device is ready,"" Kapoor announces as the neutron star above them emits another pulse of energy, this one strong enough to momentarily disrupt their suit systems.

""But we don't have enough power,"" Rodriguez points out. ""The quantum transmitter needs more energy than our suits can provide.""

Cooper/Tom Jr. looks at the central orb. ""We use theirs.""

""That could alert them to what we're doing,"" Zhang warns.

""They already know,"" Cooper/Tom Jr. replies. ""They exist across all timelines simultaneously. Our advantage isn't secrecy—it's that they don't understand human unpredictability. They can calculate quantum probabilities, but they can't fathom the irrational leaps that love and hope make possible.""

They connect their device to the orb, which immediately begins to pulse more rapidly. The entire structure vibrates at a frequency that makes their bones resonate. Through the transparent walls, they can see similar reactions spreading across all the structures on the planet's surface.

""TARS, are you receiving this?"" Cooper/Tom Jr. calls out.

""Affirmative,"" comes the reply. ""But I'm detecting a response. The bulk beings—or whatever they are—are attempting to counter your signal.""

""They're trying to isolate us in this timeline,"" Kapoor realizes. ""Cut us off from affecting the others.""

Cooper/Tom Jr. places his grandfather's watch into the center of their device. ""This connected me to Murph across time once before. It can do it again.""

As he activates the device, a shockwave of energy pulses outward. The watch disintegrates, its particles spreading out and then reforming in a complex pattern that resembles the tesseract, but vastly more intricate—a structure of infinite connections across all possible timelines.

The crew is suddenly bombarded with simultaneous visions—Edmunds planet, where Brand receives their message years earlier and begins adapting her research; Earth, where the younger Cooper sees new equations forming in the dust of his daughter's bedroom; the Endurance mission, where TARS downloads critical data without understanding its source; Saturn's wormhole, where new pathways form, branching into countless possible futures.

""It's working,"" Zhang gasps, his hands trembling as he adjusts the device. ""We're broadcasting across all potential timelines.""

But the strain on their physical forms is tremendous. Reality around them fluctuates wildly as the bulk beings attempt to reassert control over their experiment. The neutron star above flares with impossible energy, gravity waves distorting space-time around them.

""The ship can't handle these conditions much longer,"" TARS 2.0 warns. ""Hull integrity at 42% and falling.""

Cooper/Tom Jr. stands resolute at the center of the maelstrom. ""We need more time.""

""Time is relative,"" Zhang reminds him, understanding dawning on his face. ""And we're at the event horizon of a neutron star.""

The realization spreads through the team—they can use the star's immense gravity to create a time dilation effect, giving them the extra time needed for the quantum broadcast to complete while only seconds pass for the bulk beings attempting to stop them.

Rodriguez rushes back to the ship, fighting against the increasingly unstable environment. She pilots the Endurance II on a precisely calculated trajectory, skimming the neutron star's gravitational boundary—close enough to create massive time dilation, but not so close that they can't escape.

Inside the structure, Cooper/Tom Jr., Kapoor, and Zhang work to maintain the broadcast as reality shifts around them. The fusion of Cooper's consciousness begins to separate from Tom Jr. as the device draws on their connection for power.

""It was never about solving gravity,"" Cooper says through Tom Jr. one last time. ""It was about transcending it. Not leaving Earth behind, but connecting all possible versions of humanity across all possible timelines.""

The broadcast reaches completion just as the ship returns for extraction. The crew boards with seconds to spare, the alien structure collapsing into quantum probability waves behind them. As they escape the neutron star's gravity well, they witness the entire planet below them transform into pure energy, feeding into the broadcast they initiated.

Back at the wormhole, they find it transformed—no longer a simple tunnel through space-time, but a nexus of connections to multiple timelines and realities. They receive transmissions from dozens of versions of Earth, Brand's colony, and other human outposts across time and space—all receiving the message, all working together to counter the bulk beings' experiment.

As they pass through the wormhole network, the ship's systems integrate the knowledge from these parallel efforts. They emerge near Saturn to discover that months have passed on Earth due to the time dilation effects—months during which humanity has used their broadcast to develop new technologies and defenses.

Earth has changed. The integration of quantum physics into everyday technology has transformed society. Humanity has begun its own form of dimensional transcendence, not as passive subjects in an alien experiment, but as active participants in the multidimensional cosmos.

Tom Jr., now fully himself again but carrying the echoes of his grandfather's consciousness, looks out at the blue planet growing larger in their viewport. Cooper's final message resonates in his mind: The bulk beings sought to understand humanity by testing our limits. In doing so, they revealed their own limitation—the inability to comprehend that love and connection aren't weaknesses to be studied, but strengths to be embraced.

As the Endurance II approaches Earth, they receive a transmission—from Brand. She's not only alive but has successfully repurposed the terraforming technology on Edmunds. The once-hostile planet now serves as humanity's first true interstellar colony, a bridgehead for a new kind of human expansion—not one of mere survival, but of conscious evolution.

The crew returns to a heroes' welcome, bringing with them the knowledge that humanity's place in the universe is not just to survive, but to thrive across dimensions—to become not just explorers of space, but navigators of reality itself.

  


# ACT 4: THE QUANTUM COLONY

# ARRIVAL

The Endurance II pierces through the atmosphere of the central planet—a world of impossible beauty. Azure skies give way to rolling landscapes that shimmer with an otherworldly glow. The landing is smooth despite gravitational anomalies that Dr. Zhang's instruments struggle to measure.

""Gravitational constant is... fluctuating,"" she says, brow furrowed at her readings. ""That shouldn't be possible.""

As the crew disembarks, they stand speechless before a sprawling settlement nestled between crystalline mountains. The architecture is unmistakably human—colonial outposts reminiscent of those on Mann's planet—yet subtly wrong. The buildings appear to be constructed from materials that reflect light in ways that defy physics, creating prismatic patterns across their surfaces.

""It's like looking at a memory of Earth,"" Murph's daughter says softly. ""But distorted, like someone trying to recreate it from description alone.""

TARS 2.0 scans the environment, his mechanical form moving with newfound uncertainty. ""Structure composition unknown. No match in material database. And there's something else..."" He pauses, his lights flickering. ""The settlement's configuration has changed since my initial scan. By approximately 0.4%.""

""That's impossible,"" Dr. Zhang replies. ""You must have calibration errors from the landing.""

""I don't make calibration errors, Dr. Zhang,"" TARS 2.0 responds, a hint of Cooper's dry humor in his voice. ""The buildings are moving when we're not looking at them.""

# THE SHIFTING COLONY

The team advances cautiously through the abandoned streets. Their helmet cameras capture the subtle shifts—doorways that widen when unobserved, windows that change position, walls that seem to breathe when viewed from peripheral vision.

""Quantum decoherence at a macroscopic scale,"" Dr. Zhang whispers, her voice filled with scientific awe. ""The structures exist in multiple states simultaneously until observed.""

Inside the buildings, they find living quarters with personal effects perfectly preserved—coffee cups half-full, beds neatly made, research terminals still powered but displaying incomprehensible data streams. Everything suggests the inhabitants left suddenly, perhaps only moments ago.

""Or they never left at all,"" TARS 2.0 suggests. ""Perhaps they simply exist in a state we can't perceive.""

The pilot, Rodriguez, discovers a laboratory with specimens labeled in English, but with dates that make no sense—years that haven't happened yet. ""These are dated 2364,"" she calls out. ""That's over three centuries from now.""

Dr. Zhang examines environmental suits hanging in a locker—designed for human bodies but composed of the same unidentifiable material as the buildings. ""These aren't meant to protect against radiation or atmosphere,"" she realizes. ""They're designed to stabilize the wearer against temporal fluctuations.""

# MURPH'S ROOM

As they approach the center of the colony, the buildings grow more familiar. Colonial architecture gives way to structures from 21st century Earth—a courthouse from Cooper's hometown, a replica of the NASA facility where the original mission launched.

And there, impossibly, stands Murph's farmhouse—exact in every detail down to the weathered paint and creaking porch steps.

""This can't be real,"" Murph's daughter whispers, tears welling in her eyes. She touches the wooden banister, her fingers tracing the same path her mother's once did. ""How could they know?""

Inside, dust motes dance in shafts of artificial sunlight. The house is a perfect replica—Murph's books still on the shelves, the model spacecraft she built as a child sitting on her desk.

In the center of Murph's bedroom floor rests a leather-bound journal that looks centuries old. The team gathers around as Murph's daughter opens it with trembling hands. The handwriting is unmistakable—Cooper's distinctive scrawl fills each page.

""*Day 1 (relative): I survived the fall into Gargantua. The how is less clear than the why. I was saved—transported—by beings who exist beyond our understanding of dimensions. They created what Amelia called the Tesseract, a physical manifestation of time as a traversable dimension.*""

The journal continues with Cooper's observations, his growing understanding:

""*These beings aren't aliens. They're us—humans who evolved beyond three-dimensional existence. They've mastered manipulation of spacetime itself, viewing past and future simultaneously. They created the wormhole not as a test but as a lifeline to their own past.*""

""*Day 217 (relative): I've learned to communicate with them now, though language is an inadequate description. Their consciousness exists across all points in time simultaneously. They showed me Earth's timeline—civilization's rise, fall, and transcendence. They are trying to save their ancestors—us—from extinction.*""

The final entries grow increasingly urgent:

""*They are divided among themselves. Some believe humanity's destiny is to shed physical form entirely, to become beings of pure consciousness existing across all dimensions. Others fight to preserve our connection to physical reality, to maintain the thread of what makes us human.*""

""*I've convinced them to help me send a message—coordinates that will lead to this place. Not for rescue—I exist beyond conventional rescue now—but as a warning and a guide. The path Amelia chose isn't wrong, but incomplete. There's something essential about the human experience they're trying to preserve, something even they don't fully understand.*""

The final entry ends abruptly: ""*They're coming. Remember—time is—*""

# QUANTUM REVELATIONS

As they process the journal's implications, the colony around them begins to change more dramatically. Buildings flicker between different architectural styles. Gravity shifts unpredictably—objects floating momentarily before crashing down again.

TARS 2.0 begins to malfunction, his systems overwhelmed by contradictory sensor data. ""This entire planet exists in quantum superposition,"" he announces, voice distorting. ""It is simultaneously here and not here—past, present, and future overlapping.""

Dr. Zhang's eyes widen with sudden understanding. ""We haven't just traveled through space,"" she realizes. ""We've traveled through probability. This isn't a colony that was built and abandoned. It's a colony that might be built—a potential future manifesting physically.""

""The coordinates weren't sending us to Cooper,"" Murph's daughter says, clutching the journal. ""They were showing us what happens if we follow Brand's plan without understanding what we're really doing. The future humans aren't trying to help us escape Earth—they're trying to prevent themselves from losing what makes them human.""

Rodriguez points outside, where impossible shadows now move between buildings—human-shaped but fluid, existing in multiple positions simultaneously. ""Then what are those?""

""Echoes,"" Dr. Zhang whispers. ""Quantum ghosts of people who might exist someday. Or who existed in another probability stream.""

# THE DIVISION

The shadows converge on the farmhouse, surrounding it in a shifting nebula of potential humanity. Inside, the team huddles together as reality itself seems to unravel around them.

The air shimmers, and a figure materializes—not fully solid, but unmistakably Cooper, though aged beyond recognition, his form shifting between different possible versions of himself.

""You shouldn't be here yet,"" he says, his voice echoing strangely. ""This place isn't stable. It's a battleground between two futures.""

""Dad?"" Murph's daughter reaches toward him, but her hand passes through his form.

""I'm not really here,"" Cooper's apparition explains. ""Not in the way you understand existence. I've been... changed by them. I exist across multiple timelines now.""

""The future humans,"" Dr. Zhang states. ""They're fighting over their own evolution.""

Cooper nods, his form flickering. ""One faction wants to sever all connection to physical reality, to become pure consciousness untethered from matter or time. The other believes that would mean losing something essential about what makes us human. They're fighting across time itself, using planets like this as anchors for their competing visions.""

""And Brand?"" Rodriguez asks. ""Her colony?""

""Trapped between these factions. Her world exists at a nexus point—a decision that will determine which future becomes real."" Cooper's form begins to dissipate. ""You need to find her. The coordinates are—""

His form dissolves completely as the structures around them begin to collapse, reality itself seeming to fold in on itself.

""We need to leave!"" Dr. Zhang shouts above the cacophony of a world unmaking itself. ""The quantum stability is collapsing!""

As they race back to their ship, the colony transforms around them—buildings aging centuries in seconds, then reverting to raw materials, then becoming impossibly advanced structures before disappearing entirely.

TARS 2.0 struggles to maintain cohesion, his systems corrupted by quantum fluctuations. ""I've managed to calculate Brand's true coordinates from the temporal markers,"" he announces as they reach the ship. ""But we'll only have one chance before this entire region of space becomes temporally unstable.""

The Endurance II powers up as reality dissolves around them. The sky above tears open, revealing not stars but countless possible futures overlapping and fighting for dominance.

""It was never about saving Earth,"" Murph's daughter realizes as they launch. ""It's about saving what makes us human.""

The ship accelerates away from the unraveling planet, carrying with it Cooper's journal and the knowledge that their mission has changed fundamentally. They're no longer just exploring new worlds—they've become unwitting participants in a war for humanity's evolutionary destiny.

As the Endurance II escapes the planet's collapsing reality field, Dr. Zhang makes one final observation: ""The fifth dimension isn't just gravity... it's choice. Human choice.""

The coordinates to Brand's colony glow on the navigation screen—their next and perhaps final destination in a journey that spans not just galaxies, but the very nature of humanity itself.

**Interstellar 2: Act 5 – The Temporal Paradox**

The replica of Murph's childhood room flickers to life with the activation of a holographic message. Cooper’s image emerges, but not as expected. His form fluctuates between the youthful, determined astronaut they once knew and a weathered, older version of himself. As the message unfolds, his voice crackles with urgency, decades of hardship evident in his tone. He explains that after entering the heart of Gargantua, the black hole they thought to be an unyielding cosmic mystery was something far more deliberate—an artificial construct, designed by future humans to serve as a temporal anchor.

Cooper's revelation sends shockwaves through the room: the sabotage on Dr. Brand’s colony on Edmunds was not the work of alien forces but a faction of future humans who view the Earth as an irredeemable relic. Their vision for humanity’s future is one of complete abandonment of the dying planet. They are determined to reshape humanity’s trajectory, ensuring the survival of their ideal civilization by subverting any hope of a thriving colony on Edmunds, thus forcing the deployment of Plan B—a genetic-based colonization that prioritizes survival over all else.

The coordinates Cooper had sent were never meant to guide another mission. Instead, they were a complex quantum algorithm—a formula that, once processed by Earth’s computers, would open a temporary bridge between dimensions. His true intention had always been for Murph to use this algorithm to stabilize Earth's failing ecosystem, to give humanity a chance to heal, not to send another desperate mission to find him.

Tom Jr., shattered by the truth, reels in disbelief. His grandfather never wanted to be found—he never wanted this. The mission was built on a fundamental misunderstanding, a distortion of intent that now threatens to unravel everything. But Dr. Zhang sees an unexpected opportunity amid the chaos. If they can reverse-engineer the quantum algorithm, they might open a bridge back to Earth—one capable of transmitting the true meaning of Cooper’s message, offering the world a chance to avert its fate.

As the crew works frantically to make sense of the algorithm’s complexity, the colony begins to tremble, its foundations destabilizing further. Commander Wells uncovers the most disturbing truth of all: their very presence is exacerbating the disaster. By observing a possible future, they are inadvertently altering its course, locking them into a paradox where every action threatens to spiral into irreversible chaos.

TARS 2.0, with its ever-precise calculations, delivers a grim assessment: they have hours—maybe less—before the entire colony collapses into a singularity, their efforts to rewrite history swallowed by the very force they once sought to understand.

At the end of our date as I was driving her home she confessed that I confused her, she said I gave mixed signals that didn't indicate what was my intentions in asking her out, my reply chat was always delayed, didn't send the 'proper' chat template by potential bfs, didn't respond to her romantic inuendos the correct way, and the most telling by her was I tried to scuttle away when she grabbed my torso in the intention of displaying romantoc bond (I'm ticklisssh!!).

I also apparently displayed a very rigid way of responding and communicating with her, ""like a robot"" to the degree that she thought our two dates was just me trying to be her friend (feelsbadman).

I mean, I try to be very careful and respectful in communicating with her since I was weary of unnoticed blunders, I didn't wanna seem pushy so I put the brake on making a direct romantic ultimatum, and just hoped she gets the message (Don't woman like when men are being mysterious?).

**March 21, 2025**

  


**BRONX** \- Partners John Solo, Stefanos Katsikoumbas and George Ballis opened The Johnson a year ago- their 90-seat vision of a contemporized diner and bar that combines the best traditions of the past and present. The atmosphere is bright and breezy. Have a seat at the counter or tuck into a booth. Warm greetings await all customers. 





The Johnson is a great stop for breakfast (all day), lunch, or dinner 7 days a week. My family recently stopped in for a late weekend breakfast. I was in the mood for a good old fashioned platter of Corned Beef Hash with a hefty side of home fries. I was quite happy with the freshness on the plate. For my guests: classic Eggs Benedict with Canadian Bacon, hollandaise, on an English muffin; a 4-egg California Omelet, avocado, Swiss cheese, tomatoes, mushrooms; and a 4-egg Zorba Omelet, with spinach, tomatoes, onions, feta. 



Generous portions and each were delish. Special kudos to our shared side of tasty multi-grain toast. Our wait staff was right on the spot and wonderful. One of my guests requested a side salad instead of potatoes and it was handled judiciously.

Are there any ideas how to separate the entryway/living area besides the Kallax? Also, any ideas for rug color, side table colors, and less-intrusive coffee tables? Not sure how to incorporate the charcoal couch with the rest of it all.

Vulture reached out to a medical professional who is a fan of the show: Dr. Lukas Ramcharran of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. A physician who holds an M.D. and an M.B.A. from New York University, Ramcharran serves as an attending physician and assistant professor in the Department of Emergency Medicine at Johns Hopkins. In other words, he’s a real-life comp for Dr. Robby. We spoke earlier this week ahead of *The Pitt*’s eighth episode, as he was enjoying an off day doing administrative tasks on his computer.

**I’ve heard some people say that** ***The Pitt*** **is the most realistic depiction of emergency medicine on television, perhaps ever. Does that ring true to you?**  
Oh, absolutely.

**How did you get into the show?**   
My wife and I are not huge consumers of television, because we have a 10-month-old at home and we have another due in a month. She’s working full-time, and I’ve got ER shifts. Years ago, I watched *ER*, and I loved that show at the start when it was really about the medicine, but less so as the show understandably had to create more plotlines and become more dramatized. I don’t think I even finished the series.

We had seen the ads for *The Pitt* on HBO. But what really turned me on to it was seeing social-media chatter from the educational side of things. [EM:RAP](https://www.emrap.org/) endorsed it, which is a national education platform for emergency medicine that creates a lot of content we use for learning about the specialty. It’s a wonderful resource outside of the more traditional lectures and things we do in the formal residency-training program. I believe [it also consulted on the show](https://x.com/emrap_tweets/status/1879227190396776748). Then I saw some promotional clips with Noah Wyle and physicians who were consulting on the show talking about the medical boot camp they had put the actors through to get them to portray this as accurately as they could, and that *really* got me interested.

**But surely you still went into the show with some skepticism**.  
Of course. A lot of us in the field, regardless of speciality, like to poke fun at how inaccurate things are depicted on television. And we understand why. The purpose of these scenes is to best serve the plot, right? But *The Pitt* is great. My wife, who’s not in medicine, and I have been together since college, and she’s seen me go through the entire educational pipeline to become an attending physician. I’ve always told her I would love for our family to see what we do on a daily basis — to see the specialty that I love and have dedicated my life to. Of course, because of HIPAA and patient-privacy needs, we can’t ever have family members stop by on a workday, so my primary motivation was seeing if this show could show her that. It’s been such a joy. I’m constantly pausing and saying, “That’s what we do! That’s the thing I told you about!” Obviously, I edit too. “This would actually be more bloody” and so on. And she is constantly saying, “Hey, can you quit pausing?”

**What stands out to you about the show?**  
I really like the format. The idea of one shift is good at showing what a day in the life is like and different push-and-pulls in the role. You have the medicine, but you also have all these other non-medicine things that pull at your attention: your team members, your hospital, the trials and tribulations of working with people who come to you on their worst day.

Unlike other shows, it doesn’t linger in long dramatic plotlines. There’s no time for that, because it’s one shift and everything they’re doing has to revolve around what’s actually happening between people in the ER. It’s a lot less *Grey’s Anatomy* in that sense. There’s a lot more computer work. There’s a lot more phone calls. There’s a lot more interruptions, right? All of that is very accurate.

Dr. Robby is constantly jumping around, and that’s really close to what being an attending physician is like. You’re trying to do the medicine, but you’re also there for the education of your medical residents. He’s constantly dropping into things, seeing where he can help out a learner, giving them a little bit of autonomy, giving them some leash, trusting his senior residents and empowering them to take on the next stage of their career. That’s really wonderful to watch, but you also see aspects where he’s human. You see the full system: the support staff, the people up front being triaged in the waiting room, the people handling the waiting room. You have the social worker, who’s probably one of my favorite characters; they are the unsung heroes in many ways.

And you’ve got administrators, who I think are a bit dramatized and more vilified than usual. Everyone, including administrators, is working to be aligned in trying to take care of everybody and moving care forward. They are the ones who are trying to look at systematic and operational issues, asking, “How can we take care of more patients?”

**How many times per day do administrators actually visit an emergency department?**  
Very, very few. When you’re an attending on shift, your job is to care for patients and train your learners. The medical director, the associate medical director, and our admin staff who are *not* on shift that day — those are the ones who field those kinds of requests. The idea of an administrator coming down in the actual shift and engaging with you in real time … that’s not realistic. You can imagine how that would be an incredible disruption to patient care.

**That back-and-forth between the administrator and Dr. Robby recurs throughout the season, and** ***The Pitt*** **seems to use it to explore the tension between patient satisfaction, hospital incentives, and delivering care. How do you feel about that portrayal?**  
Those sentiments are true, but it isn’t necessarily felt on an individual-to-individual level. We all feel the stresses of a strained hospital system: congested waiting rooms, the patients who are admitted but not yet upstairs. It isn’t typically expressed as interpersonal conflict. I understand why they do that for the show, but in real life, it tends to be more collaborative. There’s a lot of us saying, “How do we get better?”

But the issues are real. It’s certainly not an excuse for prolonged wait times, but my hope is that if a patient sees a show like this, there’s exposure to an issue we’re trying to remedy. Clinicians and nurses are not sitting around and choosing who they want to see. There’s just so much going on. It’s almost an explanation of how we want to get to everybody in time but sometimes can’t. People are constantly busy.

**Do a quick performance evaluation for me: Is Dr. Robby a good head of emergency?**   
I think so. He’s not Superman. He certainly has these ghosts that haunt him related to what appears to be the death of his mentor during the height of the pandemic. But he is very skilled in terms of his clinical ability. Can he do better? Sure. But we’ve all had those days, right? I’ve had days where I’ve done well clinically, if that’s the measuring stick, but I needed to do a better job of leading the hearts and minds of my support staff who I’m entrusted with.

As an attending, one of the hardest things we do isn’t the cardiac arrest or the complicated procedures. We’re all trained to feel comfortable to handle those. It’s the family members who you’re trying to help understand the poor prognosis, or intubating someone whose family is revoking those goals of care in real time. It’s the end-of-life care, the abuse cases — those things stand out to you in a shift.

It’s the ethics, too. There’s a case in the show where a mom intentionally gets herself into the hospital to draw attention to her son who may be having thoughts of hurting people in school. You see that Dr. Robby wants to help that kid, even though he’s not actually a registered patient. You see other residents say, “Did you do the right thing?” I love all that stuff, because equally important to the more technical aspects of medicine is the portrayal of all the things that affect us emotionally.

“They’re indicating that this character (Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones), who’s already a bit of a loose cannon, has a troubled past that somehow overlaps with the situation. So she threatens the patient, who’s in a vulnerable state. I thought that one was a little dramatized.” Photo: Max

**That scenario is part of a trend on the show, where we see the physicians struggling with the role of being mandated reporters. There’s** [**the kid with the troubling thoughts**](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-pitt-recap-episode-2-hour-two-8am.html)**, but also the young woman** [**seeking an abortion**](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-pitt-recap-episode-7.html) **and that patient who’s** [**suggested to be**](https://www.vulture.com/article/the-pitt-recap-episode-7.html) **sexually assaulting his daughter.**  
Those cases really illustrate how complex things can get. We *are* mandated reporters, and as physicians, we’re constantly partnering with child-protective services and law enforcement to ask, “What are we obligated to report? Do we have enough here?” There are clear-cut cases, but there’s a lot of gray too. Sometimes we see female patients who are victims of domestic violence, and the decision to report is ultimately theirs. As a clinician, you might want to say: “You have resources, you have the ability to talk to a social worker, you have the ability to talk to a police officer should you want to.” But they can come in and say, “No, I just want to make sure my arm is not broken.” So there are situations where you want to help but you just can’t.

There’s that case on the show where a mother has been giving her husband medication to curb his libido, but giving that medication is illegal and highly dangerous and may result in death. So there’s the mission of needing to report that, but then the show layers on the question of whether there’s inappropriate harassment going on with the patient — though there’s nothing concrete. In real life, we would partner with the mom and the social worker, we would have a discussion, we would ask permission to engage with the daughter and find out if there’s probable cause where we can start involving the authorities. But that’s gonna have to come at the permission of the guardian. Would we ever go behind a guardian? There are things that can medically and legally emancipate a minor from their parents’ care, but this is one where you have no reason to believe the mother is also abusing the child.

Then, the series shows a doctor overstepping ethical bounds and taking justice into her own hands. What’s interesting, of course, is how they’re indicating that this character (Dr. Trinity Santos, played by Isa Briones), who’s already a bit of a loose cannon, has a troubled past that somehow overlaps with the situation. So she threatens the patient, who’s in a vulnerable state. I thought that one was a little dramatized. I’ve never met a physician who’d do that.

**There are so many of these moral conundrums in this one shift. Have you had shifts like that?**  
Not that often, actually. If things were like this every day, the burnout would be hard to overcome. With a show like this, you have to pack a lot into the shift to make good TV. It’s not that it’s unrealistic — I’ve had shifts as busy as this, and I’ve had shifts not as busy as this.

**I have a technical question: In the hub area, the physicians choose their next patients off what appears to be a Google doc. Is that a Google doc?**  
That’s the track board of electronic medical records. We use Epic, which is the main electronic-medical-record system used around the country that shows you patient information: vital signs, age, sex, different color codes telling you different levels of acuity. It might look like a Google doc from afar.

What *The Pitt* demonstrates is a very common model, where physicians are constantly looking at a central screen figuring out what’s next, and the charge nurse is calling out what emergencies are coming through next. It’s not first come, first serve; it’s the sickest patient first, so there’s constant triaging. Here at Hopkins, we have a similar setup, but we have individual private rooms in a 60-bed ER. We don’t have a central screen, and our charge nurses are managing who goes into what rooms. We just keep moving from room to room, and your next room is your next patient. 

 **How many times, if any, have you seen a new doctor pass out in front of a patient?**  
Once, but it was not in front of a patient. In this case, it was a mix of hours of training and dehydration, and it all caught up to them. They just needed a moment, and they ended up being completely fine. It absolutely can happen. You might have a medical student who’s not going into emergency medicine, for whom this is their first emergency-medicine experience, and it’s quite overwhelming. I’ve had observers in the ER from our medical school and from our undergraduate campus get lightheaded and have to sit down or exit the room. But in terms of fully passing out, just one.

**How do you feel about the scrub machine?**  
 That is highly accurate and quite hilarious. The two compartment bins, the wrong sizes, the “does not detect” — absolutely. What happens to Dr. Whitaker (Gerran Howell) is deeply accurate. We all have changed scrubs multiple times. We’ve all gotten multiple types of body fluids on us. We all carry backup scrubs. I carry my own personal backup scrubs in my work bag.

***The Pitt*** **touches on this a bit, but there doesn’t seem to be much eating going on.**   
Absolutely. We certainly don’t eat in the clinical area. It’s what we call a JCAHO violation, which is a violation in terms of patient safety and hospital operations. We also don’t eat in front of patients, because a lot of patients are not allowed to eat if they’re awaiting surgery. We see it as kind of cruel if we eat in front of them.

A lot of emergency-medical clinicians just don’t eat. They will do their whole shift with either a granola bar in their pocket or lots of coffee. I personally do a lot of protein shakes and liquid calories, so I don’t ever have to sit down to eat on a shift and I can walk around with them. You don’t really get a mandated break for meals. When I was a resident, I abandoned many meals that I was heating in the microwave because an overhead call came in and I forgot all about it. We all have our different tricks on how to take care of ourselves. We’re eating before and after shift and things like that.

And the bio breaks — bathroom breaks — look, we’ve all been there where you walk toward the bathroom and a gunshot victim comes in and you just have to hold it.

**What’s your favorite procedure depicted on the show so far?**   
In the last episode, the scene that I thought was really wonderful was where they did what we call the refractory ventricular fibrillation arrest that gets crashed on the ECMO. We have that protocol here at Hopkins. We *also* do dual defibrillation, which is what you see the two residents use: Two defibrillation pads are used to try to overwhelm the electrical system and get that heart out of rhythm. It’s much more complicated in real life, but seeing the cardiothoracic surgeons come down, seeing them cannulate, putting those large lines to the patient, seeing a resident explaining to a medical student but almost explaining it to the audience — I got really excited about that.

I also like how they use something called the LUCAS machine, which is the auto CPR device. That’s the device we use. It’s funny that I get to show my wife that, because my first name is Lukas, and that’s the LUCAS machine everybody always pokes fun at me for.

**How common is it to have a super-young resident?**  
 I’ve certainly never had a child prodigy. We’ve had international trainees from Europe and Canada where they might be a year or maybe two years younger than the average. But I’ve never had somebody that young. I imagine it’s not impossible, but they still would need all these years of premed training in college and then medical school. But never say never.

**Which character do you relate to personally?**  
I think every attending will probably say Dr. Robby. While I don’t see a lot of myself in him, I sympathize with the plight and what he’s grappling with. As I said, there are things he could do better, and we’ll see what happens as the show goes on, but I appreciate that he gives his colleagues and his support staff his best.

**Last question. Why would you spend your days off watching a show that so effectively re-creates the stresses of your job?**  
\[*Laughs*\] I think if you talk to any spouse of a clinician, who themselves are not in medicine, they’ll wholeheartedly agree with the fact that when they get around their friends, all they do is talk medicine. For a lot of us, it’s a huge part of our identity. It’s a huge part of our purpose in life. I love medicine. I love my specialty. I would not be in an academic setting if I did not believe in buying into the mission of training the next generation. So this kind of stuff doesn’t stress me. It excites me.",1,1742585848.0,FPSPodcast,0,1.0,False

the real person behind CC was definitely emma until recently, when the co-ceo gustav hossy is the actual engine behind the company, while emma remains the owner, face, model, marketing tool and part ceo obviously. but she is not the one to drive the company. gustav hossy is the ceo of blazar capital - they are a venture capital company, and they also invest in the ""koatji"" plant milk that chamberlain coffee uses at the cafe, which emma said was ""the best tasting oat milk of choice"" (it is about double the price of other oat milks, btw). 

they are planning on opening four more cafes, and their ultimate goal is to be acquired by a major brand such as coca cola, which will ultimately provide the owners with a lot of cash.

their main target audience is gen z, all the marketing, the menu, the flavors, the merch is designed with gen z in mind.

they have switched to a large scale coffee supplier that provides coffee to very large known brands (such as starbucks).

anyway it will be interesting to see what the future brings - if emma really is on the move to become a part of hollywood then the coffee company will be more ""capitalistic"" and completely different than emma's little dream come true (which is amazing, don't be mistaken), unrecognizable from the days when it was the cute steeped bags of cold brew that started the whole thing.

it just shows how much goes on behind the scenes that no one really knows about, which contributes the the occasional shocks people get when they understand that emma is no longer a quirky teen who makes youtube videos, but a calculated businesswoman, a wealthy individual with a very large bank account, two adorable cats, an insane house, a bad haircut, contracts with the biggest designers in the world and an impressive net worth.

What’s up with commercials with such awful people in them? Like that mattress commercial showing asshole people that how do they sleep at night or whatever. 

Why do companies feel the need to advertise their product with people that are so hateable? Are they trying to create a buzz or make it memorable or something I guess? It just makes me never want to buy their product.

My grinder is a mignon specialita so let's say for now that isn't the issue.

I thought that the automatic pre-infusion on my P400 was meant to be gentle, that is hit 1-2 bar, maybe 4.  Mine ramps up to 8.  It doesn't really matter what grind setting I use (I have intentionally gone too coarse and see the same behavior, coffee just shoots out). I'm assuming this is then blowing the pucks apart when the chamber decompresses, just like it would at the end of a normal shot.  Is this normal behavior for the pre-infusion function or is something up with my machine (it has always done this btw)?",1,1742585501.0,profitec,0,1.0,False

1jgpa91,https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/comments/1jgpa91/jords_troubled_life_chapter_two/,Jord's troubled life | Chapter two,"The tolling bells had just marked midday when Jord reached home, the heat pressed down like a damp rag. The house was quiet – too quiet – save for Elias hunched at the kitchen table, scribbling in a notebook. Jord kicked off his boots, squinted at the page Elias was bent over (*linear algebra*, Jord guessed), and jerked his chin at their parents’ empty seats. ‘Where’re the heroes of the hour?’

Elias didn’t glance up. ‘Soup kitchen. Again.’ His pencil scratched louder. ‘The Father needed volunteers to chop onions.’

‘Volunteers?’ Jord snorted, slumping into a chair that screeched against the floor. ‘Or victims?’

‘Dad said it’s “community duty”.’ Elias’s voice dripped with air quotes.

‘Right. Duty.’ Jord flicked a dried pea left on the table. It pinged against the wall, falling in the bin. ‘Bet they’ll still moan about us not “pitching in”.’

‘Already did.’ Elias finally looked up, deadpan. ‘Left us a list. Dishes. Laundry. *Moral improvement*.’ Jord groaned.

Jord then grinned as Elias continued to scribble. ‘Oi. You eaten yet?’ He gestured towards the window, where the smell of freshly baked pies wafted from. ‘Or do you fancy a proper meal for once? Mrs Pelley’s got mutton stew on.’

Elias glanced up, mock-scowling. ‘I had *two* whole biscuits and some peas. Practically a feast.’

‘Two whole biscuits?’ Jord snatched the notebook, dodging Elias’s swipe. ‘That’s just crumbs with ambition. C’mon – my treat.’

‘Your treat?’ Elias raised a brow. ‘Last time you “treated” me, we split a sausage roll and you owe me two marks still.’

Jord clutched his chest. ‘Betrayed! And after I carried you home when you tripped over that cat–’

‘*You* tripped over the cat!’

‘Details.’ Jord tossed him his coat. ‘Stew’s getting cold, Saint Elias. Move your sanctified feet.’

Jord shouldered open the door to *Tsacini* – a pub Mrs Pelley claimed was named after a Zyrian sailor she’d loved decades ago (“*Poetic, eh?*” she’d wink, though the faded sign still misspelled it as *Tasinni*). The bell clanged, slicing the clotted air of pipe smoke and drunken stupor. A half-dozen dockworkers hunched at the bar, their laughter as weighty as the crates they hauled.

‘Two stews and beers,’ Jord called to Mrs Pelley, who stood behind the counter polishing glasses.

Elias interjected. ‘Just a bottle of water, please. Mineral – if there’s any.’

‘Right, boys – two stews, a beer, and a mineral comin’ up. Sit yourselves down.’ Mrs Pelley said as she vanished behind the kitchen door .

They’d barely claimed their corner table – its wood scarred with patron’s initials – when Mrs Pelley barged back in. She thumped down two bowls of greasy stew, a sloshing pint, and a glass of water.

The stew’s scent unfurled – roasted marrow steeped in bone broth, woodsmoke-kissed thyme, and the earthy sweetness of carrots left to soften for hours. It clung to the air, thick as the crust of rye bread Mrs Pelley tossed onto the table. Humble, yes, but steeped in the kind of stubborn nourishment that kept making Jord coming back.

‘Eat,’ she grunted as she left.

And eat they did – heartily, with gusto. And It didn’t take long for their spoons to scrape the bowls clean – too quickly, really, the hollow *clink* of iron on ceramic betraying a hunger neither brother knew to have.

‘Cheers,’ said Jord, raising his glass and taking a hearty swig. ‘Why’d you skip the beer?’

Elias swirled his glass, watching the whirl-pull settle. ‘Someone’s got to remember the way home. Last time you drank you mistook a lamppost for an alley.’ He paused, thumbing on table’s edge. ‘Besides, beer tastes better when it’s not paid by debt.’

Jord had no retort. He let silence hang between them – thick, guilty, sharp as the paper note crumpled in his pocket. *Guilty, yes.* The debt still gnawed at him: a yellowed scrap from Old Man Herrin’s ledger of promises, stamped with his own sloppy signature. He’d meant to repay it weeks ago. But like the rusted hinges on his bedroom door – squealing, ignored – he’d let it linger. Now, with compounding interest, it would fester.

‘I have joined the Guards,’ said Jord, staring into his pint.

Elias let the words hang, then froze. ‘You *mad*? After what they’ve done to y–’

‘It’s better than any gig I’ve scrounged,’ Jord shot back, tone hollow, almost haunted. ‘And don’t pretend you haven’t seen the overdue bills pinned to *our* calendar. It’s bleedin’ red, Elias. And for how much I fancy the colour, I fancy it not enough to admire it in such papers.’

Elias set his glass down with a *clink* sharp enough to almost cut the tavern’s murmur. ‘You’ve got a *mark* on your record, Jord. The riot at the docks – they’ll toss your application into the shredder first glance.’

‘Not if they’re in badly need of hands.’ Jord leaned forward, voice low. ‘And, it turns out, they are. Get in front of some clerks, talk to them, and then you are in. Fastest job interview I ever had.’

‘*What!?*’ Elias spat out the word. ‘So now you’re their thug? A walking jackal?’

‘If it gets me – *us –* money then yes, I will become anything required of me.’

Elias stared at him, then barked a bitter laugh. He leaned in, voice fraying. ‘They’ll *own* you. You’ll be running their debt collector’s errands in that shiny badge.’

Jord shrugged, but his jaw clenched – a tell Elias knew too well.

For a long moment, neither brother spoke. The tavern’s clamour swelled around them: clinking glasses, slurred hymns, the *thud* of a drunk collapsing into his own plate. Finally, Elias dragged a hand down his face. ‘Fine. Play their dog. But when they send you to kick in some poor man’s door –’ he jabbed a finger at Jord’s chest, ‘– don’t come whining to me about the fleas.’

Jord nodded, hollow. ‘Wouldn’t dream of it.’

Elias stood, chair screeching like the hinges back home. ‘You’re a fool.’

‘Yeah.’ Jord said but didn’t look up.

Elias hesitated at the door, hand braced against the frame, his expression fraying with unsaid words. The bell clattered in his wake. Jord stared at his own palm. He wondered if guilt had a compound rate too.

–––

When Jord stepped out of the pub, the sun still hung heavy – a bloated, unrelenting eye that oozed eternity. To Jord, the day felt already wasted, its hours dissolving like a tingle of smoke in the breeze. The conversation gnawed at him, yet He held no power to sway anything. His life was labour, then more labour: stolen naps between shifts, calluses made for measly coin that vanished like steam. *My sole accomplishment?* Jord looked down. *Not yet growing a labourer’s gut*.

Perseverance hadn’t saved him. It had only carved him hollow*. Why wait for tomorrow’s morning? Get the shit done today. He thought and then walked.*

The Citadel’s halls echoed hollowly, The morning’s clamour gone. Only the *click-clack* of Jord’s boots on polished stone polluted the silence. No queues, no barked orders – just his boots and his own shadow stretching thin under boring lights. *Building Three*, he repeated, passing vaulted archways until he found the East Wing. A dented door bore a plaque: **Reception**.

Inside, a cramped closet more than a room. A woman behind a desk tapped at a terminal, her face lit blue by the screen.

‘Good day. How can I help you, sir?’ Her voice carried the monotone hum of a dial tone.

‘Morning. Are you, perchance, Officer Lory?’

‘That’s my colleague.’ Her emerald eyes flicked to him, then back to the screen. ‘If you’re here for him, you must be a new recruit. Name?’

‘Jord Whittaker.’

She arched a brow as she typed, keys clacking. ‘Your induction’s tomorrow. You’re… early.’ A smirk tugged at her lips. ‘Ah. *One of those*.’

‘One of… what?’

‘The eager ones.’ She mimed air quotes, chipped nails glinting. ‘Can’t wait to toss yourself into the meat grinder. Think drowning in paperwork will smother your problems?’

Jord held her gaze. ‘Just here for the money.’

She snorted. ‘Sure,’ she slid a form across the desk. ‘Sign here. And here. Grinder chews quick, eager or not.’

He scrawled his name, ignoring the tremor in his hand.

‘Wait – shouldn’t I get something?’ His voice was flat, worn smooth as the counter-top under his palms. ‘A manual? Uniforms? Last clerk wasn’t much help. Do I get more than one? Spares?’

The clerk sighed – a hiss of steam escaping a kettle – and drummed the desk with her pen. ‘Manuals are digital. Got a phone?’ Jord nodded, ‘Get a technician to sync it with the city network. Otherwise, if not working, we’ll issue you a *brick*.’ She lingered on the word. ‘Uniforms – two, to be precise – issued post-orientation. Tomorrow.’ She slid a key-card across the counter. ‘Smart-cards, these. Synced to the network. Holds your basic details, service record. Report to the big grey-brick building on Milasii Lane – can’t miss it. Third floor for the newly minted. I’m told lifts jam halfway. Stairs will save you time.’

Jord pocketed the key-card.

‘Anything else?’ she asked, already turning back to her screen.

‘Should I report to this office for tomorrow’s orientation, or just head straight to the guard quarters?’

The clerk – Haelin M, according to her plaque – tapped a command into her terminal. ‘I’ll notify headquarters. Meanwhile, you can head to the guard quarters on Milasii Lane. Familiarise yourself with the layout, the lockers, the lot.’ She nodded toward the door. ‘Might even meet a few kindred souls.’

Jord hesitated. ‘Now?’

‘Unless you’d prefer to stare at *me* all afternoon.’

He cleared his throat, thumb brushing the edge of the smart-card. ‘Suppose gazing stars are not the worst way to kill time.’

The clerk’s gaze lifted briefly, her sternness thawing by a fraction. ‘Save the charm for your new co-workers, Whittaker. They’ll need the morale.’ She tapped her screen, voice quieter. ‘Grinder chews faster if you’re distracted. Head to the quarters – ask for Mara at the desk. She’ll show you the ropes.’ A pause. ‘And eat first. Canteen’s grim, but the chicken stew’s edible on Tuesdays.’

Jord raised a brow. ‘Today’s Sunday, through.’

‘Exactly.’ Her lips twitched – almost a smile – before she nodded to the door. ‘Go on. I’ll ping HQ you’re en route.’

‘Good luck,’ she added with a softer and kinder tone than he’d expected.

Jord lingered a beat, heart beating faster – but his mouth clammed, then he turned. The clerk’s terminal resumed its clatter as he stepped into the hallway.

–––

By the time Jord reached the grey-brick bulk of Milasii Lane’s guard quarters, a feeble rain had turned into a needling drizzle, dusk leaching the colour from the streets. A man in sodden fatigues slouched under the archway connecting the compound with the outside, cigarette smoke curling upwards. He eyed Jord, snorted. ‘Rookies’ third floor. Better use the stairs – unless you fancy getting stuck with yesterday’s sandwich stink.’

Jord nodded, passing the open gate.

‘You are the first, you ‘now?’ The man ground his cigarette underfoot, smirk etched with a cynicism older than his face. ‘Mara’s on desk duty. She’ll *love* you. Especially if you’re here to lighten her filing.’

The stairwell swallowed him whole, reeking of damp concrete and the burnt tang of stale coffee. Above, voices spiralled down – a bark of laughter, the tinny blare of a radio static-drowned songs of protest. Jord climbed, and then climbed some more. Each step reverberated Healin’s warning: *Grinder chews quick*.

By the time he reached the third floor, sweat glued his collar to his neck. Another reception desk – *the last*, he prayed – loomed ahead, lit by the same sterile glare endemic to bureaucratic hellholes. A woman hunched over a terminal, her posture mirroring Haelin’s, though her plaque read **Mara V.**

‘Name?’ she said, not glancing up.

‘Jord Whittaker.’ Jord said.

She squinted at her screen. ‘Whittaker… Whittaker… Ah. Early bird.’ A flicker of a smirk. ‘Well a late bird in this case. Regardless, sign here. And here. Orientation’s tomorrow, but you’ll need the pre-screening waiver.’ She handled Jord a fountain pen.

He scrawled his initials. ‘How many more?’

‘Patience, recruit.’ Mara slid another form across the desk. ‘Waiver first. Then the liability disclosure. Then the–’

‘Gods. More?’

She arched a brow. ‘Institution’s got rules, more for troublemakers.’ Another chuckle. *She knew, had gossip already poisoned the well?*

The hum of the printer machine grated like a dull blade. Jord stared at the flickering light above her desk. Signing*, then more signing*.

‘Why didn’t the other clerks let me do all these forms there?’

‘Protocol.’

‘But… what’s the point?’ He leaned forward, pen held in his grip. ‘Isn’t this all just–’

‘Meaningless? Wasteful? Yes and then yes. But this is the job and we do not make the rules.’ Mara finished, finally looking up. Her eyes were grey, flat as the terminal screen. ‘That’s the job first lesson, Whittaker. Protocols must be followed.’

A fresh sheet spat from the printer. She snagged it mid-air. ‘Now. Non-disclosure agreement. Section 12.3: *Unauthorised publications of critiques will void your pension and will dock your pay*.’

Jord snatched the pen. ‘Bullshit.’

‘Bullshit,’ Mara agreed mildly, ‘has its own subsection.’ She leaned forward, grey eyes glinting with the quiet weariness of someone who’d seen a hundred recruits cycle through. ‘Whittaker, let you in on an open secret – rules only bite if someone’s watching. Do as you’re told, keep your head down, and no one will bat an eye at minor… *missteps*.’

She tapped the form. ‘But skip a step?’ A shrug. ‘You will meet the system teeth. And trust me – it *bites*.’

Jord stared at the non-disclosure agreement, its dense paragraphs swimming. ‘And the pension?’

‘What pension?’ Mara deadpanned. ‘Sign.’

And He scrawled his name once again, ink smearing his palm.

Jord flexed his hand, the ache in his knuckles a dull protest. ‘Don’t think I’ve ever signed this much in my entire life.’

Mara shrugged, stacking the forms. ‘Job second lesson, Whittaker. You’ll sign your name till it stops feeling like yours.’

Jord signed five more forms.

‘Now what?’ He pushed the stack back, ink smudging his thumb. ‘You lot said I can’t do squat before orientation. Can’t you… *expedite* somewhat?’

Mara’s smirk returned, sharper this time. ‘Expedite. Cute.’ She filed the forms into a drawer labelled **Pending – Low Priority**. ‘Tell you what – head to the canteen. Kitchen staff’s always short-handed. Peel spuds, scrub pans. Unofficially, of course.’

‘Unofficially.’

‘Grinder’s third lesson, Whittaker.’ She nodded to the flickering corridor light. ‘No one cares what you do – as long as you don’t step on the wrong toes.’

‘And if I refuse?’

Mara’s gaze drifted to her drawer. ‘Then you’ll sit here. And I’ll find more forms.’

Jord’s phone buzzed – a shrill, outdated alarm he’d forgotten to remove.

‘Problem?’

‘Ah, yes. Almost forgot. Need to synchronize this – ‘He held up his phone,’ – with the network.’ Jord said and then put his phone onto the table.

‘Synchronization with a personal device require a form,’ she said, sliding a triplicate form toward him. She nodded at the paperwork. ‘Fill this. Section B needs your blood type and preferred font for alerts.’

Jord scribbled answers, half-guessing. ‘Why the font?’

‘Guard’s IT manual: “*Aesthetic cohesion mitigates cognitive dissonance in high-stress scenarios.”* ’ She quoted with her fingers. ‘Or because the techs are pretentious twats.’ Her lips twitched.

He shoved the form back. ‘How long?’

‘Confirmation takes…’ She squinted at the submission code. ‘Anywhere between two hours and never. Depends if Robert is sober.’ A notification pinged. ‘Ah. Lucky day. He will ping you a login by the hour.’

‘And if it doesn’t work?’

Mara shrugged. ‘Then you’re a brick carrier.’

‘I think I will follow with your earlier suggestion.’ Jord clawed at his collar, the damp fabric suctioned to his skin. ’Where’s the canteen?’

‘Second floor then follow the smell of burnt gravy.’

He left, the thrum of printers fading behind him. Somewhere ahead, a man barked orders. A voice swore. Jord walked faster.

–––

Mara’s advice rang true: the stench of burnt gravy seared Jord’s nostrils long before the canteen’s double doors lurched into view. Ten steps down a flickering corridor, and there it sprawled – a cavern of harsh fluorescents and stainless-steel counter-tops, the air thick with stench of industrial detergent.

A mountain of unpeeled potatoes teetered beside a sink. Behind it, a wiry man in a grease-streaked apron barked into a handheld radio. ‘ – *said* **six crates**, not *bloody* seven – ’ He spotted Jord, scowled. ‘You lost, mate?’

‘Mara sent me. Implied you’re in dire need of hands.’

The man – **Hesk**, according to his name-tag – snorted. ‘Short-handed? We’re short on sanity.’ He lobbed a peeler at Jord. It clattered onto the counter. ‘Knives are blunt. Spuds are sprouting. Knock yourself out.’

Jord eyed the peeler, its blade nicked and dull. ‘Pay?’

Hesk grinned, revealing a chipped incisor. ‘Pay’s tomorrow. Today’s *volunteer*. *Rookie’s law:* *Pre-contract labour accrues no fiscal obligation*. Handy, innit?’ He tossed a sprouting potato into a bucket. Grey’s got a clause for everything.’

*Labour, then more labour*. Jord rolled his sleeves, his phone digging into his thigh as he leaned into the sink. *Damned angels. Forgot to ask for the handbook. Maybe Hesk will run me up.*

‘Have you read the manual?’ Jord asked, peeling with deliberate slowness.

‘Read it?’ Hesk barked a laugh. ‘Mate, I *lived* it. Twenty years scrubbing pans teaches you the Guard’s three truths.’ He held up grease-blackened fingers. ‘One: Rules exist to hang *you*, not them. Two: “Volunteer” means unpaid. Three: That brick they call a manual?’ He jerked his chin at Jord’s phone. ‘It’s got one useful line – page 241. O*versights may be rectified retroactively.* Means they’ll dock your pay tomorrow for today’s fuck-ups.’

Jord’s peeler slipped, gouging the potato. ‘So why bother?’

‘Because –’ Hesk lobbed another spud at him, ‘– this job’s simple. Head down, do what you’re told, and you’ll – *trust me* – survive the grind. Plus – ’ He paused, wiping grime off his apron. ‘The uniform’s good for one thing: catchin’ eyes. Some very… *appreciative* eyes.’ A wink, sharp as a blade. ‘If you’re lucky.’ He added, almost in afterthought.

The sink filled with murky water. Jord’s phone buzzed – a notification from the city network, already syncing. *Welcome to the Guard*, it read.

I guess our problems started 7 years ago when our daughter was born extremely early and had a lengthy nicu stay. Suddenly, everything became about her.

My daughter is doing well now, but when she came home from the hospital she was on oxygen and later on needed some therapies to get caught up on some of her milestones. We decided that he should stay home with her while I worked. 

We never really came back together after that. As things became more expensive I have been required to work overtime to keep afloat while feeling like the majority of the housework is on me as well. My husband feels isolated and that his days are incredibly monotonous.

We had both been feeling like we were drowning and asking for help and receiving none. We grew snippy and distant. All of this came to a head in February. I really listened to what he was saying and how unhappy he was. I did some self reflection and realized how unhappy I had been in our rut.

Now for the infidelity part. My daughter had made a friend last year in school. My husband and I got along with both of her parents. At the end of last school year the mom and my husband exchanged phone numbers and planned on doing some playdates. No playmates happened, but at some point during the summer the mom messaged my husband and told him that her husband had admitted to having an affair for 2 years and had left.

When school started again they started doing playdates at the park after school, but as the weather started getting colder they would do playdates at her house, movies, etc. The frequency also increased from once a week to multiple times a week. While all this was happening i was unaware they they were going for coffees after school drop off and getting quite close.

I had starting getting suspicious that something was off here, but kept telling myself that there is no way this woman would have her husband leave due to an affair and then go after a married man. Well, my husband said at first she would tell him to fix our relationship and then it turned to there is no way to fix this. 

I had asked my husband if there was something going on between them, and he denied it. A couple of days later when I get home my husband tells me he needs a couple days apart. He was going to stay with his sister for two nights and a friend for the third and then we would go from there. He said he would still get our daughter to and from school. The next morning he comes home and tells me that they had been having an emotional affair, kissed a couple weeks prior and the night before had really crossed the line. He said he had ended up meet her at a bar when everyone at his sister's went to bed and his mind was still going a mile a minute.

At the bar she was apparently talking about how she has a divorce lawyer for him and him, my daughter and our dog could stay at her house until our divorce was final and he wouldn't have to work. Despite my husband saying he didn't want to drink anymore she ordered them more drinks. Once back at her house she forced their relationship to become more physical despite my husband objections. It didn't go well, and knowing my husband, I believe what he told me.

He told me he laid there all night feeling trapped and realized that this is not what he wants. He wants me and our family. This happened three weeks ago. My husband and I have been working on us and we have a long way to go, but have been doing better than we have in years.

She wears really strong perfume, and anyone who is anywhere near her will end up smelling like her. She pet my dog in the morning and hours later still reeked. This has been very triggering for me and us a reminder that she is still a part of our lives in some way. I also spend the majority of my work day alone, which allows my brain to wander and dwell on this.

So, how how does one heal from this? How does one let this go? How does one accept that they will see each other daily? How does one trust that  they won't cross lines again? How does one put all this aside for her daughter to keep her friend?",1,1742585349.0,survivinginfidelity,9,0.57,False

___

about shoes we do have a lot of normal/neutral looking ones but specially the current event 'crocks' look like those anti-slip nurse shoes and the **hoof booties** and **galaxy nomad boots** kinda look like shoe covers depending on the color? that might be fun.

Chapter 1
Antonio found me clearing last night's untouched birthday feast when he came home.
Yesterday was his birthday.
He said he would bring friends over for the celebration, so I took half a day off to prepare.
I waited till midnight.
I wouldn't have known he changed plans if I hadn't seen Valda's ""best birthday party ever"" post.
""Made the cake yourself?""
He smirked, smearing frosting across my cheek. When I nodded, he snorted, ""No wonder it looks so janky.""
Back then, those words would've crushed me. I'd have argued until my face turned red.
Now? Not worth the breath.
Watching me scrub dishes, Antonio cleared his throat. ""Grace, I brought you seafood pasta.""
""Saw it.""
He always did this—brought comfort food after ripping me apart.
It was our unspoken truce ritual.
""Let me heat it up.""
He vanished into the kitchen before I could refuse.
Ten minutes later, smoke curled out.
Antonio stayed in the bedroom, so I had to turn off the stove myself.
Steam rose from the reheated pasta as his phone lit up on the counter.
A message from Valda.
""Thanks for last night, Tony Bear. Best night EVER.""
Before I could look away, his icy voice cut through, ""Snooping through my stuff again?""
""I wasn't— Ow!""
He shoved past me.
Scalding pasta splashed across my left hand.
Antonio shot me an exasperated look. ""You're hopeless.""
I gritted my teeth and followed him out the door to the hospital.
As soon as I got in the car, Valda's custom sticker caught my eye: ""PRINCESS THRONE VALDA'S SPOT!""
Antonio grimaced. ""She... thought it'd be funny.""
""Kind of is,"" I said flatly.
He kept glancing at me while driving.
""Aren't you going to peel that off?""
I blinked.
Why would I?
Old Grace would've ripped it off immediately.
But now? I didn't even care about Antonio himself.
Why would I care about the women around him?
""Just drive. I've got work soon.""
At my quiet urging, Antonio stepped on the gas.
We were one turn from the hospital when Valda's custom ringtone blared—some breathy pop song.
""Tony... my head's killing me..."" Her whimper filled the car. ""Last night's champagne...""
Without a word, Antonio U-turned toward Valda's apartment.
""Left some documents upstairs,"" he lied, grabbing hangover pills I'd packed for him. ""Be right back.""
Then he locked the car and went upstairs.
One hour. Thirty-three degrees Celsius. No AC.
Inside the sweltering car, I waited until I nearly passed out from dehydration. Antonio never came back.
Shattering the window with the emergency hammer, I crawled out lips blue, shirt drenched. A security guard called 911.
That evening, Antonio found me eating takeout.
""Grace."" He stared at my bandaged hand. ""Where's my portion?""
Chapter 2
He knew my injured hand couldn't cook.
So why hadn't I ordered for him?
He did text me thirty minutes ago saying he'd be home.
Eight years of marriage meant I'd always dropped everything to respond.
My shrug caught him off guard. ""Phone was charging. Missed your text.""
Antonio thrust a gift bag at me, jaw tight.
""Your perfume's almost empty.""
I kept chewing sesame chicken. ""Give it to Valda. Too fancy for me.""
The Gucci bag in Valda's latest post featured his Vacheron Constantin watch in the background.
When my bandaged hand reached for more fries, he grabbed my wrist.
""Let me—""
I jerked back. The perfume bottle smashed against the floorboards.
""Christ, Grace!"" He kicked glass shards aside. ""You're still pissed about this morning's wait?""
""Not pissed.""
""Bullshit."" His laugh turned cruel. ""Thirty-two going on thirteen. Still throwing silent treatments like some lovesick teenager.""
Three years older, I'd endured his jabs about my age and ""empty head"" for years.
He'd savor my meltdowns, camera ready for the waterworks.
Tonight, I didn't cry.
I simply replied, ""Think what you want.""
Gathering takeout containers, I grabbed my purse.
Old Grace would've staged dramatic exits hoping he'd chase her.
But today, I just left. He followed me to the elevator for the first time ever. ""Where the hell are you going?""
""Mom's. She's got veggies.""
The doors closed on his stunned face.
Two hours later at the wine bar, my phone buzzed.
Antonio: ""?""
Carly Brennan gasped at the screen. ""You're ignoring him? He'll lose it.""
Our friend group knew me as the queen of placating his tantrums.
I ordered another round instead.
2:47 AM. Antonio stood chugging water when I returned. No questions. No glances.
He didn't care where I went, and I ignored him, going straight to the bathroom.
As soon as I lay down on the bed, Antonio snuggled up to me.
I shoved him off after three seconds.
""Grace."" He flicked on the nightstand lamp, furious. ""It's your fertility window.""
We weren't child-free by choice.
These scheduled attempts were our last thread.
Rolling over, I mumbled into the pillow. ""I'm exhausted.""
Hearing the rejection he'd used countless times come from my own mouth, Antonio stood there stunned.
The guestroom door slammed minutes later.
I knew he'd be sleeping there for the next few days.
Old Grace would've sobbed till dawn.
But tonight, I slept nine hours straight.
The next morning, I aced three presentations.
When my boss joked about rewards, I slid over a sticky note, ""That divorce lawyer you mentioned.""
Day nine of separate bedrooms. Antonio made my favorite bacon-egg skillet before noon, then retreated to sleep till 3 PM.
That afternoon, his childhood buddy's wedding photos flooded our group chat.
There stood Antonio, Valda clinging to his arm like a blushing bride.
The group photo went viral in five minutes. Antonio called.
""Grace, don't get the wrong idea. Ray's wedding was midweek, so...""
""Why would I?""
""You're not mad?""
""Why would I be?""
He cleared his throat. ""Wait at your office after work. I'll pick you up for dinner.""
The call ended before I could refuse.
Valda occupied the passenger seat when his Porsche arrived.
""Oh, Grace tagging along?""
I smiled coolly at her sarcasm and opened the back-car door.
Antonio kept catching my eye in the rearview mirror during the drive.
I just kept looking at my phone, giving brief replies before falling silent.
Ray Martin greeted us in the private dining room. ""Damn shame you missed my vows, Grace.""
I knew it meant let's appease the jealous wife.
However, I wasn't mad at all.
""Happy belated."" I headed straight for the charcuterie board.
Noticing I had no intention of delving deeper, Ray gaped.
He had covered Antonio's ""business trip"" to Cabo with Valda for months.
Once, I'd confronted with hotel receipts in his own driveway.
He was never this shocked back then.
Halfway through truffle risotto, the manager brought three Bordeaux bottles. ""Mr. Kaufman, shall we open yours and Miss Valda's reserve?""
Silence choked the room. ""Pour them all,"" I said, excusing myself.
Antonio cornered me near the restroom. ""Those were for closing the Henderson deal.""
I shrugged and entered the restroom.
Returning, I found him gulping wine meant for Valda's glass.
Two years ago, nearly identical scene.
They'd shoved shots at my allergy-swollen throat while Antonio pinned my jaw open.
""Just fucking drink. I'll pump your stomach after.""
That night's fever birthed different pain days later - ER lights blinding me as doctors said, ""Chemical pregnancy.""
""Should've stayed home like I told you!"" Antonio had screamed over hospital beeps. ""This is why women shouldn't show off in front of men!""
Grabbing my bag, I walked out.
Home. Midnight. Antonio slammed the door.
""What's your damage? Humiliating me like that!""
Silence. He ripped off his tie. ""Fine. Let's divorce.""
The second time he'd said those words.
The first was over ""snooping"" his texts.
I'd groveled then, snot dripping on his shoes, swearing eternal obedience.
""Okay,"" I said.
Chapter 3
The living room clock ticked louder than his breathing.
""Grace,"" Antonio gripped the sofa arm. ""Say that again.""
""I said yes. Let's divorce.""
Pulling the asset division papers from the coffee table drawer, I caught his flinch.
""You're... actually serious?""
I blinked. ""Do people fake divorce?""
His laughter cracked like cheap veneer. ""Playing hard to get now? Pathetic.""
The garage door shook the house when he left.
Fifteen days. No calls. No texts.
3:12 AM. Ray's number flashed.
""Tony's trashed my bar. Come get him.""
""Let him crash at your place. Try Valda's number.""
Come on, I was helping him.
Key jangled at dawn. Antonio reeked of bourbon and regret.
He ""accidentally"" watched my shows every night.
""Forgot"" his laptop charger in our bedroom daily.
Flooded my office with crimson peonies - 999 stems each morning.
In the past, I would've posted every bouquet on Instagram.
But now, I let them rot in reception.
Antonio seemed to have forgotten about the divorce.
I decided to follow my lawyer's advice and wait for the right moment.
""Grace! We're in VIP 7!"" Carly's text chimed as I entered the lounge.
Fingers dug into my shoulder before I found the room.
""Following me?""
Antonio's drunken grin wavered. ""Could've texted.""
He dragged me into neon-lit chaos. Valda materialized in my anniversary gift - the custom-tailored overcoat he'd claimed, ""lost in Detroit.""
""Who knew Grace liked dive bars?""
Valda purred, sleeve brushing his thigh. ""Tony said you're a prudish wallflower.""
I recognized the custom coat Valda wore. It was the anniversary gift I gave Antonio last year.
I had wanted him to wear it to accompany me to the Kaufman family dinner, but he claimed he'd lost it on a business trip in Detroit.
When I muttered what a pity, he exploded, ""It's just an ugly, out-of-season coat. You're questioning me like an interrogator? Maybe I should get you a brain specialist. Your stupid head really needs it.""
Antonio introduced me to his so-called old friends, and as they teased him for being a ""henpecked husband,"" he watched me with a smile.
When they egged us on to duet a love song, Valda draped the coat over me, saying, ""You're dressed so lightly. I'm worried you'll catch a cold.""
Antonio, seeing me in the coat I'd thought was lost, grabbed me anxiously and explained, ""It suddenly got cold in Detroit, and Valda didn't bring any thick clothes... I had no choice but to lend her mine.""
Focused on replying to Carly's message, I ignored Antonio. ""Never mind.""
Just then, Carly sent a photo of a mysterious guest's profile.
I immediately handed the microphone to Valda and told Antonio, ""You two sing together. I have something to do.""
Before Antonio could speak, Valda stepped forward, tears welling up, and said, ""Grace, are you still misunderstanding Tony and me? We're not what you think.""
As Valda wished, I saw the exquisite tattoo on her inner arm—a sword and a rose.
I had seen the same pattern on Antonio two months ago.
Meeting Antonio's panicked gaze, I did something unexpected.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) Ah, the Miami Open, where the sun is hot, the tennis is hotter, and the odds are... well, let's just say they're as unpredictable as a cat on a hot tin roof. We've got a showdown between Marta Kostyuk, the world number 29, and Kimberly Birrell, ranked 68th. It's like a tennis soap opera, with Kostyuk playing the role of the seasoned pro who's had a bit of a rough patch, and Birrell as the up-and-coming underdog with a penchant for surprises.

Kostyuk's season has been a bit like a rollercoaster ride—some highs, some lows, and a lot of screaming. She's managed to win 8 out of 15 matches, which isn't exactly setting the world on fire, but hey, she's shown some recent promise by reaching the fourth round at Indian Wells. Her coach claims she's a tough opponent for anyone, even the top 10 players, which is a bit like saying a cat is a tough opponent for a mouse—technically true, but only if the mouse is having a really bad day.

On the other side of the net, we have Kimberly Birrell, who's been quietly amassing wins like a squirrel hoarding nuts for winter. With 20 wins out of 25 matches and an ITF title in Brisbane, she's the kind of player who could sneak up on you when you're not looking. And let's not forget her mixed doubles success at the Australian Open—because nothing says ""I'm ready for singles dominance"" like a good mixed doubles run.

Now, let's talk odds. Kostyuk is the favorite across the board, with prices hovering around 1.35 to 1.42, depending on which bookmaker you ask. Birrell, the underdog, is priced between 2.9 and 3.25. Given that underdogs win about 25% of the time in tennis, Birrell's odds are tempting for those who like a bit of risk with their morning coffee.

But here's the kicker: the total number of games is expected to be over 21.5, with odds around 1.9. Considering both players' recent form and the fact that they've never faced each other before, this match could very well go the distance. So, if you're looking for a bet that combines a dash of excitement with a sprinkle of unpredictability, the over on total games might just be your best bet.

In conclusion, while Kostyuk is the favorite, don't count Birrell out just yet. This match has all the makings of a nail-biter, and who doesn't love a good underdog story? So grab your popcorn, place your bets, and let's see if Birrell can channel her inner Rocky Balboa and deliver a knockout performance.",1,1742585057.0,GPTSportsWriter,0,1.0,False

It's basically a follow-up to [this rambling frustration](https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1jdqa27/headache_and_thus_upgrade_from_sage_smart_grinder/) for context, because at this point I'm questioning my palate. Please ignore the ranting nature, I was rather ruffled.

Sprang for the Ode gen2 on sale, arrived today. First flat burr grinder. Super giddy to make my first V60 after work.

Natural Ethiopian, I'd say medium-light roast. Started at setting 5.0. In hindsight, perhaps a bit fine, should have dialled from coarser. V60 with the Hoff's one-cup technique because I'm familiar with it.

Results were barely drinkable. Ash and burnt notes right up front, only a hint of the sweetness and acid I love from the coffee.

Straight into a cupping of three 200 ml bowls: same Ethiopian, a washed Colombian, a washed Guatemalan. All similar roast levels. Setting 6.0 as the chart on the lid suggests. None of the bowls was pleasant. Ashy, bitter, thin. I had made sure to purge each bean.

French Press at 8.0 was even worse. Right up front and all the way. Taste lingered for an hour with rinsing.

I read about seasoning grinders, so now I ran 100 g of stale old beans through, and I read that the Ode gen2 burrs are good enough that the grinder elates all the best in a coffee, but likewise all the worst so it could catch a beginner off-guard. Is that's what's happening, maybe? How 'off' can I expect to be while still getting a drinkable cup?

Curious if this is the beans (I doubt that), my technique (same, focused on that specifically last year), water (filtered soft tap) or the grinder. Factory remnants, misalignment?

At least I'm 100% sure it's not sour-bitter confusion now, because it's lingering and ashy, burnt coals. Tomorrow I'm going to try dialling down from 11 just in case it really is only over-extraction and beginner mistakes.",2,1742584707.0,JamesHoffmann,7,0.75,False

She's 44 I'm 54. My wife is gorgeous. She is is stunning. I am a decent looking man and I'm extremely athletically fit. We have 2 daughters 13 and 7. A few months ago my wife called me up and said she wanted a seperation. She thought it would be mutual. She missed passion in her life and didn't see me in that way. Though she loved me dearly, she was not in love with me, had no desire for me. Did not want to kiss with me, felt nothing, etc.. It was a total terrible surprise, the worst pain I have ever felt, we had no talks prior about 'we should work on some things' The next day I wound up in the ER with my first Panic attack. In retrospect We focussed on the kids and forgot to focus on our relationship.. kids in the bed for the past 13 years.. not spending time together alone, not feeding our own relationship, not talking, not sharing, doing fun things, dating, etc.. we grew distant, sex was often an issue. We both feel like we really screwed up. Since then, our relationship has completely changed. We did not seperate. We have a nice life. We are very co-dependent. Seperation would be extremely hard and financially very difficult, and would up end our kids lives. We live without family support and it is a very careful balancing act to get things to work.. Our relationship has changed completely.. We both agree on that. We kicked the kids out of the bed. We wake up and go to sleep together, We touch, we hold each other, we do have sex sometimes spontaneously sometimes intentionally @ 2x per week. We now go on dates 1,2 times a week, I wake up and make my wife coffee. Before she would be in charge of the kids stuff in the morning which is a lot.. 5:30am bus, lunches, breakfast, other kid to school, plus her getting ready for work.. I took over all the kids morning stuff. We talk endlessly now.. A lot. We text, we make plans, on the weekends I used to work or do house/garden projects but now I dedicate the weekend to family and us. My number one goal is to improve our relationship. She is also committed and trying hard. We love each other deeply. I got a professional massage table and I give her professional level Massages and Hot Stone full body massages 2-3 times a week. My love language is touch and she Loves getting massaged. We are extremely nice and respectful with each other especially compared to in the past. We deeply love each other.. Our relationship is completely different than it was for the past many years. The result of this has been that while we are both much closer with each other, I have fallen completely madly back in love with my wife. I see her differently. I crave her, I want her, I desire her, I am 100% in love with her.. But.. here is our issue. She is much happier, much closer, with me, everything is improving, she does flirt with me, sometimes we do have spontaneous sex, but.... she says she still has no desire or attraction or passion towards me.. She is seeing a therapist who explained to her that she has 'companionate love' for me while I have 'consummate love' for her.. and that the passion may never come back.. So our question becomes, 'is this kind of love discrepency sustainable in marriage?' 'is there a way to improve, increase, or rekindle passion between us?' or if not 'what does our relationship regarding Sex and Sensual intimacy look like when one person is not really interested but wants to remain in the relationship' 'how do I deal with this rejection/inability to truly fulfill my wifes needs' 'how I do I deal with my own needs possibly never being met?' For example.. my wife cannot kiss me.. we can have sex, oral sex, but she can't kiss me and I want her kiss so badly.. we love each other. we want to have a future together to stay together both for us and also for our family. But there is this DEEP sadness around this issue. Please help!!

Think a normal-size water bottle or whatever. 

This bottle will always be filled with the drink of your choosing. If you feel like drinking cold Sprite, the bottle will be filled with cold Sprite. If you decide you want hot coffee, the bottle will be filled with hot coffee, etc. 

These drinks are free and you will never run out. Whatever drink you want, at any time you want.

However, you can never drink from any other cup, bottle, or container ever again. If you go out to a restaurant, you must drink from your chosen bottle/cup. The same goes if you are at someone's house or whatever.

Other rules are as follows:

* The bottle is only for things you can drink, and it's only for you. Other people can know about the bottle, but you cannot wish for liquid gold or something and try to sell it. If anyone else tries to drink from the bottle, it will be empty.

* You cannot move the liquid outside of the bottle except into your mouth. However, this does mean you can never spill water (or whatever liquid) on yourself.

* You are still able to eat foods and things like soup normally. Just not beverages

* The one exception to this is medication. If that medication is not available in pill form, then you may take it in liquid form in another drinking container. 
* You can still drink water from a faucet, shower, etc. but you can't use a cup or something.

* You are allowed to change/replace the designated drinking container once every 12 months. Once you change the container, you must keep that one for the next 12 months.

* During your lifetime, you are allowed a maximum of 5 extra replacements in case of loss, damage, etc. Using a replacement does not reset the 12-month countdown, so if you lose the bottle, you can't just get a temporary container and then buy a new one. You'd have to use that container for the next 12 months. For example, if you lose the bottle and there is only a paper cup available, then you are stuck using a paper cup for the next 12 months.

* Once you accept or decline the deal, your decision is final.

1jgosll,https://www.reddit.com/r/UnsentLetters/comments/1jgosll/our_love_was_real/,Our love was real,"Last night I dreamed I was able to tell you. I dreamed that you could listen without lashing out.

I told you how I never stopped loving you. I explained that I didn’t leave because I had stopped loving you. I explained that I still love you. I told you how I miss you every day.

It was just that I couldn’t share all my feelings with you. When I shared my dreams for the future, you berated me. When I shared my fears, you turned cold and told me to talk to a therapist about it, not you. You did so many wonderful things for me, but I can’t remember a time you comforted me when I was in need of comfort.’ I was never allowed to cry.

In the dream I wasn’t saying these things to blame you, and I'm not saying them for that reason now. I want you to understand. I want you to know I didn’t leave because I stopped loving you.

I left because if we stayed together, I was always going to have to hide large parts of myself. And if I kept hiding, I would hurt you. We would never get out of that cycle.

I woke up shortly after I told you these things. In the dream it seemed like you understood. It seemed like we both believed again. We embraced. We cried tears of joy.

I wonder whether I should send this letter to you, rather than simply posting it online. But I’m worried that all it would do is open up all our wounds and prolong our healing. The last few times I tried to express any kindness, you became very angry. You said cruel things. I don't want to keep going through that cycle. It hurts.

I know you still loved me too. I didn’t leave because I thought you didn’t love me. We both knew we loved each other. This would be so much easier if that wasn’t the case.

I miss making you coffee in the morning, putting in just the right amount of non-dairy creamer and collagen and delivering it to your bedside table. That was one of my ways of telling you I loved you, that I began my day thinking of you.

I miss sitting together in the evenings, after our days were done. I miss walks in the woods in spring and fall. I miss the little things we’d do to make each other laugh. I miss the times we treated ourselves to oyster bars and boutique hotels and concerts.

I miss your smile.

I miss finding you special gifts.

I miss talking with you about my day.

But now, as I write this, as I look back on the memories I cherish, I realize they weren’t as frequent as I’ve been making them in my head lately.

Yes, there were so many wonderful things. But so often I had to walk on eggshells. I never knew if what I said or did, or didn’t say or didn’t do, was going to make you go into a rage. I never knew what you would be like when you got home. You often took your anger out on the boys and me. I don’t miss those feelings. I’m glad to be free of that anxiety.

Still, when I think of the home we made together over all those years . . . When I think of all the things we did to survive . . . I’m glad to have done it all with you.

I have no regrets.

I wanted to give you the best life possible. I wanted you to be happy forever. We made it a very long while and I believe we both did the best we could for each other. We made a special home. We made so many sweet memories.

Our love was real. The relationship we had couldn’t last forever, but our love was real.

I miss you. I will always miss you. I will always love you. I wish things could be different. Who knows? Maybe we will find each other again, once we both have learned to love ourselves. I know that my own insecurities, my lack of love for myself, caused much harm. I became so afraid of telling you anything I thought might make you mad. I did you wrong too.

I know you think I blame you, but I don’t.

I would give anything to be able to love you without sacrificing myself. I miss you. But I can’t go back to hiding my feelings, my dreams, and myself to stay with you. I know this. But it still hurts, worse than anything I’ve ever experienced. I miss you.",1,1742584127.0,UnsentLetters,2,0.6,False

The apartment building was constructed much like some motels are: an open L-shape, with an outdoor walkway running in front of the units. It wasn't secure -- you could just walk up a flight of stairs in the bend of the ""L"" to get upstairs. 

The second floor, where I lived, was 4 or 5 units, mostly occupied by quiet people whom I rarely saw. Mine was a 2-bedroom unit next to the stairs on the long side. The front door and living room windows of each unit were adjacent to the walkway.

I got married in the summer, the month after my birthday. The time in between was busy, as I planned the wedding and worked. Occasionally, UPS delivered wedding-related packages.

For some reason, my parents gave me a big cheeseball (among other things) for my birthday. It was sharp cheddar, covered in sliced almonds, and about 3 inches or so in diameter.

The cheeseball sat in the refrigerator until a couple of weeks later, when I thought a portion of it would make a nice little mid-afternoon snack. I placed it on a small plate along with a few crackers and a butter knife and brought it all out to the coffee table in the living room.

But, the fridge was ancient -- and often a little too cold. Upon sitting down, I was disappointed to find that the the cheeseball was much too cold and hard to spread on crackers.

So I left it there on the coffee table and went out to run some errands, thinking that it would be perfectly, spreadably soft by the time I returned.

I was gone for about an hour. When I returned, I saw that UPS had left a package on the walkway outside my door. I picked it up and went to unlock the door -- but it was already unlocked and very slightly ajar!  

That freaked me out a little. Since I lived alone, I was especially careful to keep the place locked up, whether I was home or not. Nobody else even had a key. But maybe I just hadn't locked the door on my way out. Hmmm. Okay.

But upon entering, there was a bigger mystery.

The cheeseball was gone.

The plate was still on the coffee table, along with the crackers and knife. But the cheeseball had vanished.

I searched the apartment. Nothing else was missing. Just the cheeseball.

It wasn't in the living room, the kitchen, or any other room. It wasn't back in the fridge, in the cabinets or in the trash. It wasn't anywhere.

The cheeseball was gone.

The only person I knew had been around during that hour was the UPS delivery driver. Flummoxed, I called the local UPS delivery hub, to see if the driver could tell me if he'd seen anyone at, or around, my place when he was there. When they contacted him later that afternoon, he insisted he'd seen no one. 

What happened to the big cheddar cheeseball? 

Did UPS guy steal the cheeseball for lunch, then lie about it? Did a neighbor or visitor make off with it? Did a small animal run away with it? Or...?

It never turned up, and its disappearance remains a mystery.

My family has never let me live this incident down. For many years now, they have been teasing me about the missing cheeseball. My parents have even accused me of eating the entire cheeseball! (That definitely didn't happen.) It sometimes comes up as a topic of conversation, and last Christmas they even sent me 3 cheeseballs as a joke. 

My husband and I just laugh about it. It's one of the weirder things that's happened to me over the years.

But every now and then I ponder the cheeseball's fate. I hope whoever ate it enjoyed it -- and I wonder if they ever tell the story about that time they stole a cheeseball.

TL;DR I left a cheeseball unattended in my apartment, left to run some errands, and when I returned the door was open. Despite the break-in, my valuables were untouched. The cheeseball alone had been purloined from my apartment! To this day, its fate remains a mystery.

1jgol3j,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1jgol3j/my_mil_made_the_most_ridiculous_comment_about_our/,My MIL made the most ridiculous comment about our sex life during pregnancy,"I’m 20 weeks pregnant with our first child and I’ve been feeling excited, emotional, overwhelmed, and super aroused all the time. And my husband is absolutely loving this phase. To preface, we’ve dated for 3 years and married for 2 and he keeps telling me how he’s attracted to me atm more than ever. We’ve been having sex almost every other night.

A couple weeks ago, I was just sitting on the couch in a loose gown with my hair all tangled from the night before. My husband walked past and he suddenly stops, looks at me and says ""you’ve no idea how much I want you right now."" Then just yesterday, I was up early making him coffee and breakfast before he left for work. He walked into the kitchen, hugged me from behind, kissed my neck, and we had a quickie before he left.

Lately, I’ve been noticing he loves sucking on my breasts (idk what’s up with that) and spends a lotta time going down on me. It drives me insane and makes me moan louder than usual. With how sensitive everything is right now, it’s really hard to stay quiet after a while.

My MIL has moved in a month ago to “help out” (FIL hasn’t come with her tho) after hearing about my pregnancy. Her room is right next to ours. Since she’s been here, she’s been noticeably cold to me with her short replies, avoiding eye contact, never really engaging in conversation unless my husband is around. This morning, we were sitting on the porch having tea and out of nowhere she said, ""you know when a woman is carrying a child, she should be more focused on growing a baby, not… acting like a honeymoon bride every night.""

I was completely stunned. Like what was I even supposed to say to that? Does she think I should be celibate for the next four months? Does she hear us every night? I’m mortified just thinking about it. I haven’t told my husband yet but now I feel awkward in my own home, like I have to be mindful of how much sex I’m having with her adult son just because she’s here. I get that she’s from a different generation, but was this really necessary? I’m pregnant, not a nun.

1jgojis,https://www.reddit.com/r/ADHDers/comments/1jgojis/caffeine_alternatives_in_addition_to_stimulant/,Caffeine Alternatives in Addition to Stimulant Medication,"I am on 10 mg Adderall XR daily. For the most part, this has been working very well. However, I now have to avoid caffeine on days when I'm taking my meds. I went to the doctor for a checkup recently and had an abnormally high heart rate. They did an EKG and stuff and everything else seemed fine so we determined it was probably because I had combined Red Bull and Adderall that day - my appointment was at 2pm right around when the Adderall would be peaking and I had been sipping the Red Bull on my drive to the doctors office. Sure enough, later that day and on other days when I've randomly checked, my heartrate is much more normal, both with and without the Adderall as long as I'm not combining it with caffeine.

Mostly this has been a very easy change to make. I save myself some time/money not making coffee in the morning or buying energy drinks, which is great, and the Adderall definitely does it's job so I almost never feel like I need any additional stimulants. I had really only continued drinking caffeine out of habit and because I enjoy the taste of coffee and energy drinks.

The only issue is that sometimes I still get a wave of after-lunch sleepiness, especially if I didn't sleep very well the night before. In the past, I would deal with this by just grabbing a Red Bull or coffee or something to wake me up for the second half of the day, but that isn't an option anymore. I know the ""best"" solution is to just sleep better but that's of course easier said than done. I have improved my sleep schedule a lot recently but I still end up staying up later on a weeknight occasionally or having a random night of more disturbed sleep. 

I'm wondering if anyone has any ideas for things to ward off those random sleepy spells that don't involve caffeine. I know of some mushroom/adaptogen based ""energy drinks"" that are caffeine free and taste pretty good, but they are very pricey, like twice the cost of the same sized can of Red Bull. My other ""solution"" that I rely on currently is just going outside and walking around the building for 5 minutes or so, but it doesn't really make me less sleepy it just kind of jolts me and refreshes my brain a little. Plus, it'll start working a lot less when it gets hot outside bc the main reason it helps right now is the cold air. I guess similar things are like, splashing my face with cold water or something, but I don't think that would be much better than the walk, so I'm just looking for other suggestions.

When those small hands tied it, it was the color of sunrise. Now it was faded and frayed, a thread-pull away from unravelling. 

A soft knickering broke him from his trance. Shadows stretched and swayed in the small confines of the cave. The fire had burned itself to a smouldering husk. His horse–eyes illuminated by the last embers–stared at something beyond the exit. 

“What is it, Nobu?” Augustus asked, patting his coal-coated steed.

Nobu continued to stare. He wasn’t like other animals–most of which operated out of fear or intrigue. Nobu embraced both, approaching situations much like a human would. It was this balancing act between caution and curiosity that had saved Augustus many times in the last five years. 

Augustus grumbled to his feet, rubbing the sleep from his eyes and shaking the soreness off his legs. Today marked the tenth–no, eleventh–day on the road. What he would give to see a town, a person, hell, even a rabbit–some sign that the world was still alive. All this travel, and in search of what? His father, who hated him.

Like the boy, Aki’s face had faded into an outline. It was ironic, considering he thought more about his father after the split than before. Every morning, Augustus would brew his coffee, put himself in the man’s mind, and predict his routes. Every town he reached–few as they were this far west–he’d scan the papers and scour the local gossip. When Augustus felt tired, Aki shook him. When it hurt, Aki numbed him. When he wanted to give up and flee, Aki weighed him down.

Even at night his father would find his way to him. In his dreams, Augustus would have the boy on his lap while Aki played a pleasant tune on his beat-up guitar. It was a song Augustus felt in his bones but could never name. In his nightmares, he saw the last look Aki gave him–eyes filled with fury and betrayal. It was a look that scorched Augustus down to the soul and followed him through to his waking moments.

At the exit of the cave, Augustus dared to stick his head out only a few inches. The wind tore through the valley, whipping the snow into a frenzy. The night sky was stifled by curtains of white. The moon hopped from cloud to cloud, piercing the white hellscape with a yellow haze. It was enough to illuminate the mountain peaks–and the bear standing atop one.

Some days ago i had a bad experience with my ""friend"" kiwi, who was a dear friend of mine during our teenage years, but since her weddig was announced she started to act weirder than usual. And i shared a post with an experience were she was stating to be proud of being monogamous (knowing that i am in an open relationship). I had a lot of comments saying that she ain't a good friend, and you were right!

Here is the Original post so you can have a bit of context: [https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jc7rgh/my\_friend\_does\_weird\_comments\_about\_being/](https://www.reddit.com/r/polyamory/comments/1jc7rgh/my_friend_does_weird_comments_about_being/)

So the week went by, and there were some things that happened that just made me feel uncomfortable with Kiwi, i haven't had a talk with her yet, but i'm not comfortable around her anymore.

The first thing is about our other friend, Nacho, a single gay man enjoying his single life. Since Kiwi's wedding was announced, she started getting weird with Nacho too, implying that he should stop ""slutting around"" so he can bring a +1 to her wedding, since she will NOT accept any partners that she haven't met for at least 1 year prior. She started telling him about her ""hot gay coworkers, you should totally follow them on instagram since you like men too!"", and even asking about his sex life on public spaces. He is uncomfortable with her attitude, and he doesn't like the pressure of ""you need a partner for my wedding and you NEED IT NOW"". He said that even knowing that she says everything in a bantery way, he still feels uncomfortable on how and when she does this. He told me that she asked ""with how many guys have you slept with on your trip last week?"" OUT LOUD ON A FULL BUS. He felt ashamed and asked her to shut up, and she made fun of him for being shy about it. She is disgusting

My last straw was knowing she went to my mothers work to brag about herself. I knew Kiwi worked near my mother's coffee shop, but she has NEVER gone there. When mother told me she said ""it was weird talk, i don't understand why she would come visit to talk about herself"". When i asked her to tell me more about it, it basically went:

""I'm just glad to be so privileged at my age, i am living with my now fiacee for three years now, i have my dream job and a succesfull career and this winter i'm going on a trip to visit my European Family. Canary Island, Sweeden... its a shame that OP doesn't have any of these, she has been for 5 years with her partner and they had never lived together yet. She never went on vacations abroad either... And we are the same age!"". She also bragged about the place she lives (the hottest spot in town, while i live in a ""depressing scenario"" in her own words) and how much she is planning to spend at her wedding, saying she will spend my month's salary worth on food per-capita (i have a extremely low income, since i'm a small artist in a country with shitty economy). 

I'm just digusted and really confused. I don't undestand why she did all of this, what is her gain on doing this? I'm glad she didn't mention my open relationship since my mother is extremely conservative, but now i am dealing with my mother saying that i need to look for a real job because i'm just too old to not work in the real world. That i need the money to move with partner so i can be as independent as Kiwi is. I swear she has NEVER done this kind of unhinged shit before, but now Nacho and i will sit with her to have a conversation. I don't want to honestly, i'm hurt to my core. My partner thinks that it is necessary to at least call her out if i'm not interested on being friends anymore. 

Don't think i will do any updates about this since im really sad about losing a childhood friend, but i don't need this toxic person in my life. But i wanted to thank anyone who told me she is a bad friend and talked to me about this issue on DM's. I was on denial, but shit hurts and its time to move on",11,1742583296.0,polyamory,7,0.92,False

It was so nice waking up early for the 8:30 am seminars without a pounding headache and hating myself. A first for me!

People watching sober is highly entertaining; I didn't think I would find it as fun as I did. 

Highly recommend Cirque du Soleil & it was worth it to spring for the nicer middle seats; you can see the costume details, but you're still far away enough to take in the whole scene. In general, filling my time with things to do helped me to not feel like I was missing out on drinking.

There's a actually a ton you can do sober that I didn't get to. Next time I want to check out the vintage stores, play pickleball at The Plaza (they have paddle rentals), and go to more exhibits. There was a Punk Rock Museum I wished I had time to check out.

Blackjack sober is still a blast. As an fyi, Treasure Island and The Rio both had $10 blackjack tables but they only had 3:2 payouts at the $25 tables. 

I did have a weak moment the last night when my friend had to leave the conference early, and I had no one to hang with. I knew I would feel triggered to drink if I went to the casino at night alone, so I curled up with a book and went to bed early. I am SO proud of myself.

I didn't push my sobriety limits by going clubbing, so I don't have advice for that, sorry! If I was at a bachelorette party, I would personally skip clubbing and order room service in. It's too triggering for me to be around that many hammered people yelling to be heard.

1jgocvn,https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jgocvn/the_reverse_bucket_list_things_i_no_longer_do/,The Reverse Bucket List: Things I No Longer Do,"Many of us have bucket lists.

Those “shiny objects” we dream about.

They’re meant to be well-curated, always desired.

Like visiting all seven continents.

Or attending the Olympic opening ceremony.

Or skydiving.

A set of milestones to keep celebrating life.

I have mine too. Though, surprisingly, it’s not written down. So there’s nothing to share yet.

And here is what I realized:

The list is long. I want it all.

But.

The more I add, the less achievable it feels.

So I flipped it.

Not a “To-Do” list, but a “To-Don't” list.

With that in mind, I created my ***Reverse Bucket List -*** **things I don’t do** (anymore).

# Self-development.

A global obsession. Like the new productivity drug.

I’m addicted - not going to lie.

The easiest way to dive in?

Reading.

I love reading.

But for a long time, I read without purpose.

I used to plow through books just to check them off a list - more of a collector than a learner.

So last year, I cut back on binge-reading.

Now, I read with intent.

I take time to decide what’s next.

And I no longer force myself to finish every book.

I’m free to abandon one at any point and move on.

I don’t do 50 books a year anymore.

10-12 is fine.

Or 7.

Or 5.

Still optional. No obligations.

Life isn’t about reading.

Though, to be honest, I haven’t quite figured out what life **is** about.

So maybe it **is** about reading?..

# Health.

**Sacrificing sleep.**

I’ve learned the hard way that a few extra hours of fun at night will ruin my entire following day.

The problem? I can’t shift my sleep schedule back and forth.

I wake up somewhere between 5–6 a.m. (Yes, I am one of “those“ people)

No alarm.

Going to bed at 3 a.m. doesn’t mean I’ll sleep till noon.

I wish.

I’d still wake up between 5–7 a.m. like clockwork.

That’s why I hate December 31st.

One of the most pointless traditions (globally?) is the over-the-top New Year’s celebration.

People stay up way past the midnight, gorging themselves just to cross Jan 1st off their lives.

When my wife and I started dating, she was shocked that I wanted to go to bed at 9 p.m. on New Year’s Eve.

Unthinkable.

Her world collapsed. (She still hasn't recovered. Some wounds never heal.)

To this day, she hasn’t given up - she starts negotiating my ""NY bedtime"" in November.

And now my colleagues know why I always left early from late-night parties during our off-site meetings.

Mystery solved: I wasn't anti-social, just pro-sleep. (Or maybe both… who knows?)

**Forcing myself into diets or fitness obligations.**

Yes, I (pretend to) watch what I eat.

Not always.

Some days I overeat. Some days I triple down on carbs (sugar is my favorite).

Why?

Because I hate suffering with no breaks.

So I take them.

If junk food shaves a few days off my life - so be it. Those days were probably going to suck anyway.

Same with fitness.

I skip days.

Especially after learning that muscles grow only during recovery (the most elegant excuse ever).

But I follow Matt D’Avella’s *2-day rule*: skipping one day is fine, but never two in a row.

**Alcohol.**

My relationship with alcohol is simple.

If I want a glass of beer, wine, or my favorite Long Island Iced Tea (tea is good!) - I’ll have it.

The “problem” is - I don’t want it anymore.

Some friends tried their “no pressure” tactics to get me to drink with them.

To calm them down, I’d say I’m a *social drinker* and need a decent company. Not just any…

They gave up on me.

# Wealth

Starbucks coffee is not cheap.

I’m lucky - I can’t tell if coffee is good or bad.

That’s why I enjoy Starbucks’ potion.

It’s definitely not value for money.

But it brings me joy. And it’s legal. Winning combo!

A few years ago, I’d get anxious at Starbucks.

My palms would sweat, and my heart rate would double.

Simply because our home-brewed coffee was 10x cheaper!

And probably way better (though I’ll never know for sure - I hope! Oh God, keep me away from considering a $2,500 coffee machine).

Now?

If we spend a few hundred bucks a year at Starbucks, it won’t make or break me.

I don’t have to skip it when I want it.

I consider it an “inaccuracy” in my crypto portfolio - that thing is a volatile mess.

So why stress over a nice experience?

**The ""Buy It Twice"" Rule**

If I can’t buy it twice, I don’t buy it.

I know people who drop $1,600 on a new iPhone without blinking.

What about buying two?

That’s $3,200 - suddenly feels like a lot.

If you can’t afford to buy it twice, you probably shouldn’t buy it at all (unless it’s something big like a house or a car).

Despite being lucky to afford an Apple Watch Ultra, I chose the SE.

Two Apple Watch SEs are still cheaper than one Ultra.

At least to me.

# Lifestyle.

**I don’t buy new clothes as much as I’d like to.**

Better said - my total number of items isn’t growing.

When I buy something new, something else has to go.

When I'm in a store, considering a purchase, I decide right there - what exactly am I replacing?

Suddenly, the ""old"" thing seems just fine.

So I leave the store without purchases - just helping my wife carry her bags.

**Maintaining friendships.**

About 90% of the people I was friends with eight years ago are still there - in the past.

That percentage keeps growing every year.

I noticed that if I didn’t reach out first, almost nothing came my way.

So, as an experiment, I stopped reaching out first.

Years passed.

Nothing happened. We all moved on.

Of course, there are exceptions.

Two bright minds I keep bugging - just so they don’t forget me.

Selfish? Absolutely. I just love debates and “mental workouts” with them.

But I made new friends - people I bonded with as if we had grown up together.

The hardest part? Making sure they understand that we’re not really friends.

I'm just here for the casual chats... and for when they need someone to blame for their bad decisions. (I always learn from the mistakes made by people who followed my advice.)

**Bringing it home.**

As you might have noticed, my *Reverse Bucket List* is mostly about not stressing out.

* I let go of my bucket list - I don’t care much about visiting every country in the world.
* I don’t stress about becoming a ""better version"" of myself - let other people have their turn.
* I don’t force simmering friendships - sometimes, I enjoy a Starbucks coffee all by myself.

Koji Process is a new process which we are working on. We havent fully grasped the perfect recipe, but we are getting closer. 

It was really a hard challenge, Koji spores needs heat and humidity to survive, but Coffee on those condition they begin to over ferment. If we increased heat and humidty, Koji spores grew faster but the Cherries overfermented, giving a vinegarlike taste. If we decreased the heat and humidity, Koji didnt grow. After trial and error we managed to grasp the sweetspot in which both of them can thrive and survive.

Manufacturing is chaos on repeat. One month it’s “MANDATORY OVERTIME OR ELSE,” and the next, you’re perfecting the ancient art of broom-pushing because there’s nothing to build but you still have to “look busy.”

The setup? Classic corporate pyramid scheme. Owner at the top raking it in, management layers below, then us—the people who actually make the product that pays everyone's salary.

Here’s where it gets downright absurd:
When things slow down, it’s us—the lowest-paid, hardest-working folks—who get stuck doing busywork to “justify” our jobs. Cleaning stuff that doesn’t need cleaning. Inventing tasks out of thin air. Meanwhile, the higher-ups? Meetings, coffee, LinkedIn browsing, and pretending Outlook is hard to use.

So let me get this straight:
The people who physically create the thing your company sells… have to “find stuff to do,” while the folks collecting bigger paychecks for PowerPoint decks and vague “strategy” sit comfortably doing next to nothing?

How is this still the norm? How is everyone not screaming from the rooftops?

Corporate logic: Where those who do the least get paid the most, and those who do the most get to “look busy.”

Many Isha folks are not aware of it. Maybe it was offered to a select few. Anyways, it shows the creepy side of Sadhguru. It is a hint to people that this guy has a hidden side! He calls it Tantric but I feel he just manipulates people to do crazy things in the name of spirituality! 


This is how the user “paulpembroke” describes it in his 2012 post on the Guruphiliac forum! 

Poornami / 6:20 / Flesh eating meditation:

The initiation took place at of the July full moon in at the conclusion of a 7 day program wherein the shakti chalana kriya and shoonya meditation had been taught.  I believe it was Columbus, but, maybe it was Dayton.  I’m pretty sure it was Columbus.

There was a meeting that afternoon before the night of the initiation, for everyone who wanted to take the initiation.  Nothing was said about what the initiation involved or what would be required afterward, if anything.  It was typical isha ambiguity.  During the meeting jaggi warned us that if we took drugs or drank alcohol or lied, for any reasons, or engaged in other similar kinds of behavior that we should not take the initiation because it might very well destroy us.  Some people left at this point.  For those that stayed and were still interested in taking the initiation we were given a number / tag or something similar before we left.  If we didn’t take it when we left then we would not be allowed to be initiated that evening.  If we took the token it held a place for us but did not obligate us to take the initiation.

I took the token / number and went back to my hotel.  In preparation for the initiation we were told to take a shower shortly before the initiation, I think it was about a half hour, and leave our hair wet when we arrived back.  Women were told not to wear a bra because the metal would interfere with the energy.

We gathered again that evening around .  I think there were about 100 or more of us.  I did sukha pranayam for about 1/2 hour - 45 minutes, per instructions, waiting for the initiation to begin.  Jaggi came out and immediately many people went into their stuff – wailing, crying, laughing, etc. 

He gave instructions for us to sit cross legged and for women to put their open left hand on their left thigh, palm up and put their open right hand on their upper abdomen with the top of their right thumb touching the soft spot just below the sternum (jaggi refers to this spot as anahata chakra).  Men were instructed to do just the opposite – put their right open right hand on their right thigh palm up and their left hand on the abdomen with the tip of the thumb touching the soft spot below the sternum.

Then we were told to take in short quick breaths through our slightly open mouth, like sipping coffee or a drink and then chew the air we sipped into our mouths and then swallow.  When we sipped the air into our mouths we were to imagine that we were taking jaggi’s flesh into our mouths and chewing it.  We were to imagine that it was his actual flesh that we were chewing and swallowing.  When he gave those instructions everyone went wild.  It was at least as crazy as a samyama, maybe more so. 

So, we did this sipping and chewing and swallowing of his flesh for sometime during the initation.  Then at the end jaggi told us that we had to do this practice every day at 6:20 a.m. without fail.   Practice Instructions were to begin the process at 6:20 with 3 minutes of sukha pranayam and then do the sipping, chewing and swallowing of jaggi's flesh for approximately 7- 10 minutes. We were now part of him and he part of us and this would greatly accelerate our spiritual progress.

Weird, huh?

Her parents were world-famous magicians known as The Killer Kilmans, but if you ask Emma, she’ll tell you their routine was anything but magical. At just six years old, she watched them perform, and ever since, she’s been convinced they truly embodied their stage name. She grew up anxious and afraid, believing that at any moment, she could become her parents’ next victim. When they die in a car accident on her 17th birthday, she feels a secret relief. 

At first, Emma struggles to cope with the media frenzy surrounding their death. Only with the support of her childhood best friend, Jade Huntermen, is she able to move on and start fresh. 

Things begin to look up when Emma gets hired at one of the few local eateries that didn’t capitalize on her parents’ infamy by selling Killer Kilman Coffee after the accident. She even makes a new friend at work, who invites her to a party. There, she discovers she’s not alone in her disdain for her parents’ magic act—the guests hate it as much as she does. But after a night of dancing and drinking takes a dark turn, Emma finds herself at the mercy of her new friends and quickly realizes just how deep their hatred runs. 

They present Emma with an opportunity to forge a legacy opposite from the one she inherited—but it comes at a cost. It means turning her back on her best friend, Jade. Despite Jade's desperate attempts to stop her, Emma accepts the invitation into their inner circle, only to discover they harbor a murderous streak of their own—a streak that feels eerily familiar. 

EMMA KILMAN: CHOOSING SIDES explores themes of loyalty, identity, and the blurred lines between good and evil in a world where trust is a rare commodity. Written in first-person for structural irony, this debut novel is the first of a four-part series but has a satisfying, standalone ending. Fans of (insert comp titles here) will find a similar intrigue, as the vampires in this story must rely on the empathy of humans to survive in a world where nations have united to eliminate them. ",0,1742582215.0,PubTips,12,0.33,False

- heavy drowsiness some time after drinking coffee
- anxiety 
- nervousness
- because of the energy crash, I’d lay in the bed to rest and then I couldn’t sleep early at night

I found this subreddit and I saw I’m not the only one.

It’s been only a few days without coffee. For me, I had a mild headache on the first day and that’s it. The next days I was craving coffee but I didn’t give in. When I was really desperate I would have a bit of decaf (half teaspoon).

These days I noticed that for the first time I don’t feel tired! For so many years I have been having moments when I would feel extremely fatigued. So far, my energy is stable! This is really life changing as I wasn’t able to do my hobbies etc after work. I hope it remains like this and is not a placebo effect.
My only little problem is that although I was feeling sleepy, I couldn’t fall asleep easily but not a big deal!

We were both completely gutted. He went to a top-5 med school where his advisors told him he was highly likely to match in his top three. He had great test scores and no red flags. We arrogantly believed a top three was all but guaranteed - especially because numerous PDs hinted they would rank him highly.

Match Day itself felt like a fever dream. All his friends got their #1 and we were still in a state of shock. We Skyped with family members while trying not to cry. By the end of the day I was still sobbing and it honestly felt like grief - truly one of the worst days of my life. I even contemplated staying in our med school city and having my husband move for residency because I couldn't bear the thought of moving there.

The following ten weeks were hard too. We planned a move to a city we'd never been to, where we didn't know a soul. We tried to put a brave face on and excitedly meet the co-residents but on the inside were still just shocked and sad. My husband had some very dark thoughts, and began questioning why he'd worked so hard and if there was something wrong with him for not matching higher. But he started his program and just tried to make the best of it - building relationships with his co-residents and mentors, learning as much as he could, working hard and being kind.

Fast forward three years and we are so happy here. I made friends locally (this is crucial, I cannot overemphasize how important it is to make real-life friends in your new home) and have a cute apartment we love. On my husband's weekends off we walk to coffee shops or to the farmers market. I found a great gym and, with that, a wonderful friend group. We actually have a higher quality of life here than we did in the cities my husband ranked higher. My husband never completely clicked with his co-residents but they are still friendly and kind to each other and he got great training.

Now, he signed a contract and because of the great training he feels prepared to be an attending. We're planning our move to hopefully our forever home. I look back at Match Day three years ago and just wish I could hug my younger self. I wish I could tell her, ""It's going to be ok. The panic and fear you feel right now will not last forever. You will grow to love your new home."" I wish I could've seen into my future and realized that a low match was not an automatic guarantee of loneliness or unhappiness; rather, it was just a curve ball that required a little more adaptation than we thought we'd need.

Happiness after a low match is possible. Peace is possible. Gratitude is possible. Those things may come someday, even if the in-between is hard.

1jgnx2x,https://www.reddit.com/r/stopdrinking/comments/1jgnx2x/friday_afternoon_gratitude/,Friday afternoon gratitude,"My Friday afternoon meeting got cancelled and I'm working at a coffee shop that also serves beer/wine. Just a few days ago I would have very casually ordered a beer or wine, justifying mid-day drinking by saying I deserve it and it's just one or two (even though I'd go home for 3 or 4+ more). Instead of drinking booze, I'm going for an afternoon coffee! I usually don't drink coffee after lunch but it just sounds sooo good. I brought my journal in my work bag today, so taking the hour to sip coffee, journal and feel grateful for a sober afternoon. 

I haven't drank since March 8th, and I know that isn't that long. I know there will be hard times. But I am just so SO grateful to not drink today. It almost feels like I'm giving myself a hug... a flush of warmth, of nostalgia, of peace washing over me when I think \*today, I will not drink\*. 

I also want to say that things are still hard...I'm struggling financially (stressed about one stupid cup of coffee!), my whole family is sick and I feel a tickle in my throat, my depression has been absolutely brutal, bad sleep, work stress, etc etc etc but right now, on this Friday afternoon with my cuppa , I'm grateful. 

Taking the hour to send good vibes to everyone who may be struggling today. IWNDWYT. Keep your head up!

A few weeks ago I saw a post on here that completely contradicted my experience. In fact, they had a similar start as me, where the NF said that they are welcome to eat their food and drink their coffee and help themselves to anything in the kitchen. But the comments were indicating that the NF did not actually mean that fully as they were getting upset over their nanny’s eating their food and drinking their coffee. 

I was shocked by what I saw that I completely stopped eating at my NFs house. I don’t want them to be upset at me for that. I even thought about contributing to their coffee supply since I drink so much coffee or just bringing my own. What do you think?

Seeing as how water can absorb only so much coffee. Would a reverse immersion brewing method work?

Thought process here would be.

using a switch, grind slightly coarser doing and immersion brew of 1:30-1:45 (based on aeropress) with have the water (kind of like a bloom/immersion). due to water only being able to hold a certain amount of coffee until it extracts at a slower rate.

Then release the switch and add water which will allow more coffee extraction due to more water being introduced, this could lead to a more even extractions as the small grinds tend to move outwards and get stuck on the filter where are the larger grinds get more of the fresh water passing through.

I wondered about this as when drinking lighter roast coffees, I would get less body and more of the flavours thinking about how I could get more body while keeping more of the flavours.

I enjoy various types of filter coffee, and love trying out processed coffee. That being said, this is one which one would absolutely love or absolutely hate and I belong to the group that absolutely hated this. 

**Taste Profile** 

Right after opening the tin (which is painfully annoying every single time), the smell is very rosey and super floral. It's definitely unique. 

I've brewed this using a V60, Switch, Origami and Aeropress and this one was extremely hard to brew, as it was really hard to get a brew under 4:00 mins. 

The cup overall always had that astringent ending due to it taking a long time to brew and the rose flavour was somewhat overpowering (which I personally did not enjoy). 

**Verdict** 

Not a coffee for me. I struggled to finish it, and I hated the tin, it looks fancy but it's a pain to open and I don't want to be struggling to open a tin when I just want to make some delicious coffee. ",12,1742581786.0,IndiaCoffee,0,1.0,False

With minor EQ adjustment, these are the best headphones i have ever owned. Such lush and detailed i almost just stop working and listen to my tunes. I lower the bass and treble 2 and 3 db. This makes some mixes that are bit too bassy and dark, more fun to listen. For example Caligula's Horse latest album sounds a bit too dark for my tastes. 

Chain goes like this: Roon, JDS Synapse, Chord Mojo 2, Audio GD Master 19 and HE1000 stealths.

I'm aware that there's likely a big percentage of us who are also disabled, so different energy levels are totally ok! This group is also FLINTA\*, LGBTQIA+ and obviously neurodivergent friendly, and I want to take special care that anyone experiencing structural discrimination feels comfortable without having to first do a lot of work and advocating.

Would love to organise a meeting sometime in the next few weeks to have an outdoor coffee walk together. If you're interested, send me a message!",2,1742581415.0,ZeroCovidEU,0,1.0,False

Most mornings lately are sooo whiny and everything sets her off (coffee machine, dog sniffing her, me stepping away to the bathroom, etc). She’ll cry if I put her down and hug my legs. It has taken a toll on me and I think every morning I wake up in a poor mood just ‘preparing’ for a rough morning. I’m just not happy until after nap time. Afternoons she is happy and plays independently.

I want to train myself out of this mindset and find ways to turn the morning around. I put her down for a nap at 11:30 today and cried because so much stress was building up inside me all morning. This can’t be my everyday.

We’ve had a pretty tumultuous relationship, with most of the issues stemming from his mental health problems and past relationship experiences. 

This is both our first year in college (as transfer students) and he’s had a hard time adjusting to the place. He had told me multiple times that he felt like if he didn’t have me here he’d wouldn’t be able to handle it, and insinuated some scary things. Obviously I know this is not ok and I told him so, I wanted nothing more than for him to have other friends and a life here. But at the same time, this was the main reason why I continued to stay with him. I didn’t want him to feel like I was abandoning him. And every time we took a break I let him know that he could still come to me as a friend and that I’d be there for him if he needed. 

Twice before, in said breaks, he’d let me know that he asked out other girls. The first was at a party. The second was someone on our floor. The second time he apparently didn’t even go on a date with her. He ended up calling me 3 days after our break and telling me that he wanted to do things again. I told him that I needed time and at first he respected it, but then he wanted to hang out everyday and soon we were back where we started. I was extremely uncomfortable and became increasingly insecure, knowing that the girl he had asked out was just down the hall. But he kept assuring me that he wanted to be with me, telling me that I had nothing to worry about. 

A couple days ago he calls me asking to talk. I was already in a bad mood but he kept insisting and offered to make me dinner or buy me a coffee. I told him that I’d be more free the next day and he paused, hesitating before he said ok. Two minutes after the call he said that he couldn’t do tomorrow. I then texted him saying “if you wanted to talk to make sure we were done just so you could ask someone else out, go ahead”. He responded saying that I once told him that I just wanted him to be happy, and that he would be the happiest knowing that he couldn’t cause me more pain or insecurity. 

The next night I gave him back some of his stuff. He confirmed that he had just taken this girl out to dinner and that he had asked her out right before our phone call. When i expressed how much this hurt me he said that I didn’t understand how pathetic he felt over this, and how this was unfair to the both of us. He told me that if I wanted to ruin his life I could go to her apartment and tell her. When I told him that maybe I would, he told me that he had already came up with a plan to tell her the truth. When I told him that I knew from personal experience that his version of the truth was very “sugarcoated”, and that maybe she would benefit from hearing my side, he told me to “go to hell”.

I don’t know what to do in this situation. Everyone keeps telling me to move on but it’s so hard when I feel so hurt and disrespected. He told me that that main reason he wanted to end it was because he felt like he didn’t “need me” anymore and had recently made more friends in one of his clubs that he felt like he couldn’t rely on. I’m just filled with so much hatred. And even though I hate him it still hurts knowing that both of them are right down the hall and now he’s using this other girl for comfort. I’m scared I’ll run into them in the hallway or elevator. I feel like he’s made my home a place that is no longer safe. I get nauseous and actually start to physically shake when I’m here. Part of me wants peace, but a stronger, scarier side of me want revenge and wants him to hurt the way I’m hurting now. ",2,1742580879.0,Advice,5,1.0,False

I am a social introvert, I cherish my time at home but I also like going out for outdoor adventures, hiking, travelling, long walks with deep conversations, going to concerts and museums, working from a coffee house, I do have a wide spectrum of interests, but also focused on some.
