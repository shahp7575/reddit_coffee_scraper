1ohm1un,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_somethinggoeshere2/comments/1ohm1un/i_got_kidnapped_by_aliens_and_barely_escaped_i/,I got kidnapped by aliens and barely escaped. (I got a DUI for crashing a flying saucer),"Now, before you go running your mouth about how this is the craziest thing you ever heard, the kind of story that leaks out of a bar at 2 AM, let me remind you: I fought the Goat Man of Hickory Ridge and lived. I didn't just fight him; I practically gave him a two-piece combo. I also personally detonated a whole nest of cannibal mole-men, which registered three counties over. So when I tell you I got abducted by real-deal, big-headed gray aliens, crash-landed their spaceship in Miller’s perfectly good cornfield, and then got slapped with a DUI by Deputy Henderson, you don't just believe me. You pay attention.

But I’m getting ahead of myself, a habit of mine that tends to cost me bail money.

It started about a month after I’d vaporized the mole-men. Things were on the upswing. My eyebrows, which had been nothing but a couple of charred, nervous specks, were finally growing back. I was tired of looking like a hard-boiled egg that had just experienced a constant, existential revelation. My ribs only screamed when I sneezed, and my busted knee only sounded like a rusty hinge with a vendetta about half the time now, instead of all the time. That, my friends, is progress.

What wasn't progress was the endless, slow-motion parade of government types crawling all over Hickory Ridge, ever since I’d set off what the news was calling 'minor seismic activity'. Minor, my ass. I blew up enough mountain tunnels and methane pockets to register on seismographs clear down to where the pavement ends, and they called it minor.

First, you had the USGS people with their ridiculous tripods and their fancy clipboards, taking readings and constantly scratching their heads like they’d just discovered dirt. Then the Department of Natural Resources folks, poking around like nervous squirrels, asking about ""potential sinkholes"".

Then, on a Tuesday morning, Jethro Culpepper, the County Engineer, showed up at my door. He had a hard hat perched on his head and a clipboard held like a religious text. He looked like his whole day, maybe his whole life, was about to curdle.

""Mr. Roberts?"" he said, staring down at his forms. 

""That's me. Don't worry, the house isn't on fire right now."" 

""I'm here to inspect your property,"" he continued, flat as a pancake. ""We’ve had multiple reports of structural instability in this area"".

I knew why. My house was sitting about five degrees off level. If you stood far enough back, it looked like a tired old dog that was thinking really hard about lying down for a nap.

""Yeah, well, ground shifts,"" I shrugged. ""Nature does what it wants. She’s a fickle mistress"".

Jethro just walked the perimeter, taking measurements with that official, disgusted air. Every few minutes, he’d stop, look at something on his level, and say, ""Well, that's not good"". He said it when he checked the foundation, the door frame, and especially when he looked at the southeast corner, which had practically taken a four-inch nose-dive into the earth.

""How not good are we talking?"" I asked, trying to sound casual.

He took off the hard hat, wiped his forehead with the back of a hand, and gave me the look. You know the one. The doctor look. The one where they’re about to tell you the bad news is terminal.

""Mr. Roberts,"" he sighed, the sound like air escaping a bicycle tire, ""your house is undermined. The ground beneath it is unstable, like wet oatmeal. This structure could collapse or shift further at any moment. My recommendation, a non-negotiable one, is that you evacuate immediately until proper repairs can be made"".

Translation: You're officially and spectacularly screwed, Billy Bob.

""Evacuate? Where in the hell am I supposed to go?""

""That’s not really my department,"" he chirped. ""I'm just here to assess the structural integrity, not your life choices"".

I looked at the house. It was a dump, sure, but it was my dump. I'd lived there fifteen years. I wasn't about to bail on it because some desk jockey with a clipboard said the dirt was feeling shifty.

""What if I shore it up?"" I said. 

""Shore it up?""

""Yeah. Prop it up. Make it level again. Like a bar stool with a folded coaster"".

He looked at me like I’d just suggested fixing a compound fracture with duct tape and a prayer. 

""Mr. Roberts, we are talking about structural engineering here. You’d need a proper foundation repair, possibly pilings driven deep into stable ground, and a licensed contractor. That is not something you can just prop up with a stick and some optimism""

""But what if I could, though?""

He sighed again. ""If you can genuinely demonstrate that the structure is stable and level, and that it’s not going to shift further, then I suppose I could sign off on it. But you'll need professional help, and that's going to run you several thousand dollars at minimum.""

Several thousand dollars. I had exactly two hundred bucks in my checking account and a coffee can of singles and fives under the bed. That was not happening.

Jethro left. Said he’d be back in a week to check, and if I hadn't magically stabilized the side of a mountain, he’d have to officially condemn the property.

I stood there in my crooked kitchen, which was trying to dump me out the back door, and tried to figure out what the hell I was going to do. Then I remembered. The shed. The old hydraulic jack I used to lift my Army surplus deuce and a half truck, before the transmission decided it wanted to sound like a blender full of pebbles.

It took a sweaty half hour of digging it out from under old tarps and rusty implements of destruction. The jack was a greasy, dust-caked monster, but when I pumped the handle a few times, it still hissed and lifted.

I dragged it to the low-riding southeast corner, got down on my hands and knees in the damp dirt, positioned it under the main support beam, and started pumping. It was slow motion and pure agony. Pump. Nothing. Pump. Pump. Then a creak, a protesting groan from the house’s very soul. I kept at it until the house felt like it had shifted a few inches. Good enough for now.

I cracked open a beer, sat right down on my porch steps (which were now mostly level), and took a long, satisfied look at my work. Jethro could take his licensed contractors and his ""several thousand dollars"" and shove the whole bureaucratic mess right up his clipboard.

I knew that jack wasn't going to hold forever. But forever was a long time. I figured I'd deal with that specific catastrophe when it became a more immediate, less beer-friendly problem.



Curtis Curtis owned the general store. Yes, that’s his real name. His mother thought she was a clever wordsmith; Curtis still hasn't forgiven her. The store was beautiful in its simplicity: it sold everything you absolutely needed and nothing you didn’t. That meant beer, cigarettes, questionable beef jerky, motor oil, ammo, and canned goods that had been sitting on the shelf so long they were probably older than some of the customers.

I was stocking up on essentials: a case of beer, three bags of jerky (the teriyaki kind), and a few packs of spicy peanuts. Curtis was behind the counter, fully immersed in The Hickory Ridge Tell-All, which was less a newspaper and more a certified, government-grade rumor mill someone printed at the library.

""You seen the lights?"" Curtis asked, not even bothering to look up. ""What lights?"" ""Lights in the sky. Been happening the past few nights. Folks are getting their panties in a twist"".

I dumped my supplies on the counter. ""Folks are always talking, Curtis. This is Hickory Ridge.""

He folded the paper and pointed to the screaming headline: STRANGE LIGHTS OVER HICKORY RIDGE: EARTHQUAKE AFTEREFFECTS OR SOMETHING MORE?.

""Probably drones,"" I said, dismissive as always. ""The government loves flying drones around, spying on people’s barbecues and bad decisions.""

""That's what I think,"" Curtis nodded, instantly agreeing. ""They been watching us ever since that earthquake.""

I didn't say anything. Hard to keep a poker face when you’re literally the earthquake.

The door swung open, and in shuffled Sleepy Jones. Sleepy was the other official town drunk, Ezekiel being the third. Sleepy lived in a beat-up camper behind the church, blew his disability check on the cheapest bottom-shelf vodka, and had a solid reputation for saying things that were either profound or completely, irrevocably insane.

""Curtis,"" Sleepy slurred, his eyes red and watery, ""You got any of them little, personal bottles?""

""I got pints,"" Curtis said, producing a bottle of vodka from under the counter. Sleepy paid with a sweaty wad of crumpled ones and a handful of loose change.

""You boys talking about the lights?"" Sleepy asked.

""Yeah,"" Curtis said. ""Billy Bob here thinks it’s drones"".

Sleepy turned to look at me, a deep, unsettling sincerity in his bloodshot gaze. ""It ain't drones."" 

""What is it, then?"" I asked. 

""UFOs. I saw one last night. Big bright light, hovering over the ridge. And I swear, I saw something get pulled up into it.""

""Pulled up?"" I repeated. 

""Sucked up. Like a vacuum cleaner for the cosmos. There was this black bear, a big son-of-a-gun, just wandering around, and that light came down and whoosh, up it went"".

Curtis rolled his eyes so hard I thought they might get stuck. ""Sleepy, you were drunk.""

""I'm always drunk,"" Sleepy countered, taking a swig. ""Don't mean I didn't see it"".

""Uncle Rufus used to see lights,"" I offered. Both Curtis and Sleepy stopped and stared at me. 

""Your Uncle Rufus was legally insane,"" Curtis stated. 

""Yeah, but he was right about some things,"" I countered. ""He said the government was watching us, and look, he was right about that. Maybe he was right about the UFOs"".

Sleepy nodded, taking another pull from his pint, suddenly reverent. ""Your uncle was a smart man.""

""He also thought lizard people ran the DMV,"" I said, trying to reintroduce reality. 

""Do they not?"" Sleepy asked, genuinely confused.

I grabbed my beer and jerky and left before the conversation could achieve escape velocity.



When I got home, I noticed right off that something was off. The door didn’t just stick; it fought me. I had to hit it with my shoulder just to make the latch catch.

The jack had failed.

I walked around to the southeast corner and, sure enough, the hydraulic jack was lying flat on its side in the dirt, completely defeated. The whole house had slumped again, settling back to its five-degree angle of tired misery.

""Goddammit,"" I muttered.

I dragged the jack back under and grabbed three rough cinder blocks. I figured if I jacked the house up and slid the blocks under the beam, that would spread the weight out better than just the tip of the jack. It took an hour of agonizing work: Jack it, slide a block, adjust, jack it again, slide another. By the time I was finished, the house looked level enough to fool a blind man in a heavy fog.

I cracked another beer and admired my crude, perfect handiwork. ""Good enough,"" I declared to the woods.

It wasn't. I knew it wasn't. But it would hold until the next inevitable crisis.

That night, I tried to sleep, but the earlier tilt had totally messed up my inner sense of level. Even lying flat, I felt like I was constantly rolling off the bed. After two hours of fighting my own pillow, I gave up, grabbed a beer, and went out to the porch.

The sky was clear and cold enough to see your breath, and the stars looked sharp as tacks. I sat down, sipped, and looked up. I figured I’d stay up a while. Keep an eye on the sky. See if Sleepy’s UFO was coming back to vacuum up another bear.

I stayed up two nights straight watching the sky. All I saw was one airplane and maybe a blurry satellite.

On the third night, exhaustion won. I fell asleep around two and woke up at dawn with a beer can glued to my hand and a crick in my neck that felt like somebody’d replaced my spine with a rusty chain. The house hadn’t helped. One of the cinder blocks had cracked like cheap porcelain, and everything was tilted again. Trying to sleep felt like being tied to the deck of a boat in a violent storm. After a few beers, it felt worse.

So I kept the vigil. Stayed up. Watched the sky. Drank beer. Waited.

On the fourth night, around eleven, I was three beers deep when I saw it. A light. Not a plane. Not a satellite. Big, bright, and moving in ways that absolutely nothing man-made ought to move. It came from the east, completely silent, a pale greenish-white glow. It stopped dead, hung there for maybe ten seconds, then darted across the sky like a frantic cockroach before shooting off toward the northwest ridge. It disappeared behind the trees.

I knew that ridge. Two miles out there’s a cave. Wide as three garage doors, a dozen yards deep. Me and my cousin Darrell used to dare each other to go inside when we were kids, but we never made it far before chickening out.

That was where the light had gone. And that cave? That was exactly the kind of place a UFO might choose to hide its shiny, silent self.

I started gathering my supplies. Flashlight: the heavy-duty Maglite. Rope: thirty feet, just in case. Weapon: the big, reliable crowbar. Sustenance: Teriyaki beef jerky. Courage: Six tallboys of beer.

No gun. The Goat Man had taken care of my last one. But the crowbar had worked just fine on the mole-men, so I figured it would work on little green (or gray) men, too. How tough could they be, anyway?.

I slung the pack over my shoulder and headed out. The moon was fat and full, so bright I barely needed the flashlight. Ten minutes in, I cracked the first beer. Just to take the edge off the reality of what I was doing. Halfway there, the trail suddenly looked different at night, so I stopped for the second.

Around one in the morning, something moved in the black curtain of trees to my left. Big and dark. I froze, lifting the flashlight, sweeping the powerful beam across the gloom.

Nothing.

Then I heard it. A bleat. Faint, distant, but I knew that sound like my own name.

The Goat Man.

I stood stone still, crowbar raised like a silver cross, my heart hammering so hard I thought it would blow a gasket. If he came out of those trees right now, I was in absolutely no shape for a rematch.

Nothing moved. Just that one lonely, mournful bleat, and then silence. Might've been him. Might've been a dream. Might've just been the beer starting to kick in. I decided to not stick around and find out which.

By the time the sky turned that weary, hopeful gray, I’d finally reached the base of the ridge. My knee was grinding like a coffee mill full of gravel, and my legs felt like cooked noodles, but I was there.

The cave entrance was exactly where I remembered it. Wide and low, a dark, hungry mouth cut into the gray limestone. The air rolling out of it was cool and damp, carrying that sharp, wet mineral smell that belongs only to the deep earth.

I cracked the third beer, took a long, resolute pull, and stepped inside.

Time to meet some aliens.



The cave entrance was massive up close: thirty feet wide, fifteen feet high at the center. I clicked on the Maglite. The air temperature dropped twenty degrees immediately. The limestone walls were slick and smooth in some spots, rough and pitted in others. My footsteps echoed.

The smell hit me about twenty feet in. Chemical and sharp. Like if you mixed bleach with burning plastic and left it out in the sun. Something was definitely in here.

I moved slow, sweeping the beam. The chemical stink got stronger, coating my mouth.

And then I walked face-first into something that simply wasn't there.

The impact knocked me backward. I dropped the flashlight; it clattered, spinning, sending a frantic, jerking beam of light across the walls.

""Son of a bitch!"".

I grabbed my nose, checked for blood. Nothing broken, but it felt like a hornet’s nest had detonated in my face. I picked up the flashlight, pointed it forward.

Still nothing. Just empty, dark cave.

I reached out. My fingers brushed something smooth and bitterly cold. It felt like metal pretending to be air.

I followed it with my hand. It curved, a wide, gentle arc. I was tracing the outline of something impossibly huge. A ship. Invisible. Cloaked. Whatever aliens use to hide their shame.

Then came the noises. Not quite human voices. High-pitched chirps mixed with deep clicks and electronic warbles that went right into my jaw and made my teeth ache.

Outside the cave. Getting closer.

I killed the light instantly and pressed myself flat against the cold, gritty wall, breathing shallow and trying to become part of the rock. My heart was hammering like a trapped bird trying to escape my ribs.

Then, a tapping. Click-click-click. Footsteps, but definitely not human ones.

Three figures stepped out of the night and into the cone of light from the cave entrance.

They were gray. Maybe four feet tall, thin as a stack of broom handles. Their heads were enormous, looking ridiculously too big for their spindly bodies. They had huge, terrifying black eyes that took up half their faces. No noses, just two little slits. Their mouths were barely there, like an afterthought. The skin had a weird texture, smooth but not quite, like powdered rubber.

They moved with these fast, unsettling little jerks, like broken stop-motion puppets trying to walk. They stood there, squeaking at each other in that horrible, dental-drill language. One held a little gadget full of blinking lights. He pointed it toward the cave mouth, got a green blink, and started walking toward the invisible ship.

A chunk of the air beside them simply opened up. Just gone. A soft, eerie blue light spilled out. No door. No seam. Just pure, waiting light.

I waited until all three disappeared inside. The opening was still there. Still glowing.

I crept closer, peeked in. The corridor stretched maybe fifty feet, lined with that soft blue glow and dark walls. It looked bigger on the inside. Way bigger.

No time like the present, as my Uncle Rufus would always say right before he did something regrettable.

I ducked my head and climbed in.

The floor felt weirdly springy under my boots. The air was hot and thick with that chemical smell. The mechanical hum of the ship filled the space, with a chorus of beeps and hisses underneath it. Deeper inside, the gray bastards were still talking.

I moved slowly, trying not to make my boots squeak. The hall branched off in a few directions. I picked one at random.

That's when I started seeing the rooms.

The first room had a window. Inside, a man was strapped to a tilted table. Awake. His eyes were wide and glassy, staring at nothing. Little floating metal bugs worked over him, all legs and tiny drills and needles. One jabbed something thin into his stomach. His back arched, his skin stretched tight. The needle sank deeper. His eyes rolled up white. His mouth opened, but no sound came out.

The floating thing withdrew the needle. Something dark dripped from the tip. Another metal bug moved in, extending a different tool; this one had tiny, rotating blades. It lowered toward the man's abdomen.

I spun away from the window before the spinning blades could touch him. My stomach was doing a violent, slow-motion roll.

The next room held a woman. Her chest was split wide open, ribs clamped apart by metal spreaders. I could see her heart pounding frantically. She was breathing. Shallow, rapid breaths. Her eyes were open, staring at the ceiling, but she was alive. Awake. Feeling everything.

Three aliens stood around her with glowing tablets, poking at her exposed, pulsing organs with metal rods. One of them reached right inside her chest cavity and lifted something. Examined it. Her breathing hitched, becoming labored and desperate. They put it back. Started poking something else.

""Jesus Christ,"" I whispered, the name tasting like acid on my tongue.

I kept moving, because if I stopped, I was going to puke or scream or both, and either way, I’d be next.

The third room. Bones on a table. Human bones, half-cleaned. Strips of flesh still hanging off them. In the corner, a flannel shirt and a pair of boots.

I pressed my forehead against the cold wall and tried to force my lungs to work right. I had to get the hell out of this nightmare.

The halls twisted. I passed enormous tanks with shapes floating inside them, bubbling green fluid surrounding what might have been people once. Another room held a sound that was screaming so high and steady it no longer sounded human. I kept my head down and didn't look.

A smaller room sat ahead. Darker and quieter. No tables. No aliens. Maybe a storage closet. I slipped inside, and the door hissed and contracted shut behind me. I let myself breathe for the first time in an hour.

A screen glowed in the corner. It showed the world outside. But it wasn't the cave rock. It was space. Below me, blue and curved and shining, was the entire planet Earth.

""Well, I’ll be damned,"" I said, the words barely a rasp. ""Guess Uncle Rufus was only half crazy. Earth’s round after all"".

I sat down against the wall. Pulled a beer from my pack and cracked it open. This was it. I was in space. On an alien ship. Probably about to be dissected or probed or turned into some kind of weeping experiment. Might as well have a beer.

I finished the first one. Opened the second.

The door slid open. A gray alien stood there, holding one of those blinking devices. It looked at me. I looked at it. Its huge, dead-black eyes didn't blink, not once.

For three long seconds, nothing happened.

Then it made a sound. A warbling squeal that started low and climbed until it felt like it was trying to stab right through my eardrums.

I threw the beer can directly at its oversized head.

The can thunked off its skull, spraying cheap beer everywhere. The alien stumbled back, squealing like a stepped-on cat with a head cold. I was already sprinting down the hall, crowbar gripped tight in one hand, my boots squeaking on the rubberized floor.

Behind me came more squealing. More clicks. I guess the jackass called for backup.

I ran blind through a maze of twisting corridors. Left. Right. Left again. Every hallway looked the same as the last.

Something zipped past my head and hit the wall. The spot where it hit instantly started smoking, melting, the metal turning black and bubbling like a nasty wound.

I looked back. Three of them now. Running in that jerky, broken way. Holding those devices pointed right at my back. Ray guns. Actual, honest-to-God little ray guns, straight out of the B-movie late shows I used to watch as a kid.

Another shot sizzled past, close enough to singe my hair and make me smell like burnt popcorn. I dove through the next open door, stumbled into another hallway that was sloping down. My knee and lungs were screaming fire, but I kept running.

The corridor opened into a much larger space. I stumbled out into what had to be a hangar bay. And scattered around were smaller ships. Little flying saucers, maybe fifteen feet across, sitting on landing struts like shiny, squat bugs.

Escape pods? I figured one of them was my ticket out of this madhouse.

I heard the warbling behind me. Closer now. I ran to the nearest saucer, slapped a panel on the side, and started pressing everything. Just mashing my hand against the smooth surface. The panel next to me lit up. A door hissed and slid open in the side of the saucer.

The aliens rounded the corner. Four of them. Moving toward me. Raising those stupid ray guns.

I flipped them the bird with enthusiasm and dove inside the saucer.

The cockpit was tiny. One seat, restraints, a curved console covered in glowing buttons and alien hieroglyphs. A screen showed the hangar outside. Through that screen, I could see the aliens at the doorway, raising their weapons. One stepped inside the hangar.

I started mashing buttons. All of them. Slapping them like a man trying to kill an angry wasp with his palm. Lights flashed. The console beeped. The restraints snapped tight around me, crushing my ribs.

The aliens were inside the hangar now. Three of them. Moving toward the seat. One raised its ray gun for a clear shot.

I slammed the biggest button I could find, a round bastard glowing neon orange, like it wanted to be hit.

The engine fired.

It felt like getting instantly run over by a truck made entirely out of gravity. My head slammed back, my vision went completely white. The saucer screamed forward. The aliens scattered like bowling pins. The hangar walls blurred into a streak. An energy field was blocking the exit, but the saucer punched through it anyway, like tissue paper.

Suddenly, I was outside. Space. Stars spinning like drunken carnival rides.

The saucer stabilized, drifting forward. Behind me, the mother-ship shrank. Then, smaller, angrier saucers started launching. Coming for me.

""Oh hell,"" I said.

I looked at the panel. There had to be something. Some kind of go-faster button. But every button was covered in alien scribbles. No way to know what anything did.

The pursuing saucers were getting closer. Small silver dots growing into metal fists.

I started hitting buttons again. Random buttons. Desperate, panicked buttons. The saucer lurched hard left. Then it dove. Dropping toward Earth so fast, the screen around the edges started glowing an angry, terrified red.

Something exploded behind me. I didn't care what.

The Earth was filling the entire screen now. I could see the curve flattening out as we got lower. I could see the atmosphere, a thin blue line of salvation that I was about to hit like a thrown rock.

The saucer shook violently, like a washing machine full of broken bricks. Fire streamed across the screen. The air inside grew instantly hot enough to sweat through my flannel shirt.

The chasing saucers finally broke off. Either they couldn't handle the atmosphere, or they decided I was too much trouble for a routine abduction.

The fire on the screen faded. The shaking got worse, a sickening rattle. Through the screen, I could finally see the landscape. Mountains. Trees. Rivers. All rushing up at me way too fast.

I started slapping buttons again. Pure, frantic hope. The saucer finally responded, angling up, but we were still dropping. Fast. I could see individual trees now. A road. A barn.

I hit more buttons. One of them did something glorious. The saucer suddenly slowed, like somebody’d stomped on the universe's brake pedal. The stop nearly tore me in half.

We were still dropping. Still moving too fast. But slower now.

The screen showed a field. Corn. Rows and rows of it.

The corn was rushing up fast. Too fast.

The crash threw me against the restraints so hard I actually saw cartoon stars and birds. The saucer bounced, skipped, tore up dirt and cornstalks, flipped twice with a deafening screech of metal, and then stopped upside down. Alarms were screaming a high, frantic note, and smoke poured out of every seam.

I hung there for a minute, doing a painful, slow inventory. Everything hurt. My ribs, my back, my neck, that old busted knee. But I could move my fingers. Could move my toes. I could breathe, even though it felt like inhaling ground glass.

The restraints finally released, and I fell onto what was now the ceiling, landing in a heap of pure, exhausted agony. The door was above me. I crawled toward it, pushed. It opened halfway, then jammed. I had to kick it the rest of the way with a desperate grunt.

Fresh air hit me. Cool and clean. Smelled like dirt and corn and home.

I crawled out, fell onto the dirt, and just lay there, staring up at the sky. It was dawn. Pink and orange streaks across the horizon. Birds were singing a stupid, cheerful song. Somewhere in the distance, a rooster was crowing about the morning.

I'd made it.

That’s when I heard the siren.

I sat up. A police car was coming down the dirt road, lights flashing that sad, familiar red and blue. It pulled up about fifty feet away, and Deputy Henderson got out.

Henderson was about my age. Played football two towns over until he blew out his knee. He’d been working for the sheriff for maybe five years, and he took his job with a terrifying seriousness.

He walked toward me, hand resting on his gun, looking from me to the smoking saucer half-buried in Miller's cornfield.

""Billy Bob?"" he said, his voice flat with disbelief. ""That you?"" 

""Hey, Henderson,"" I gasped. 

""What in the living hell happened here?""

I looked at the saucer. Looked at Henderson. 

""I crashed,"" I stated. 

""I can see that, Billy Bob. What is that thing?""

""UFO,"" I said simply.

Henderson stared at me. Then at the saucer. Then back at my beer-soaked face.

""You're telling me you crashed a UFO in Miller's corn field?""

""That's about the size of it,"" I nodded. 

""Have you been drinking?"".

That's when I remembered the empty beer cans still rattling around in my pack.

""I mean, technically yes,"" I explained, ""but that's not why I crashed. I crashed because I don't know how to fly a stolen alien spacecraft, and I was being chased by other alien spacecraft, and the controls are all in a language that looks like dentist tools, so I just started hitting random buttons.""

Henderson walked closer, sniffing the air with professional disgust. 

""How much have you had to drink?""

""I don't know,"" I frowned. ""Four beers? Five? But that was over the course of like six hours, and most of it was before I even got on the ship.""

""Uh-huh,"" Henderson said, pulling out his radio. 

""Dispatch, this is Henderson. I'm gonna need a supervisor out at Miller's field off Route 9. We got a… situation here.""

Henderson looked at me. Looked at the smoking saucer. ""Just get someone out here,"" he repeated into the radio.

He put the radio away and pulled out his handcuffs. 

""Billy Bob Roberts,"" he announced, his voice taking on a heavy, official tone, ""I'm placing you under arrest for driving under the influence.""

""I wasn't driving,"" I protested. ""I was flying.""

""Operating a vehicle while intoxicated, then.""

""It's not a vehicle! It's an interstellar spacecraft!""

""It's got a motor, and it moves, that makes it a vehicle in this county,"" he insisted. ""Turn around.""

""Henderson, you have to listen to me! There are real aliens up there! They've got a ship in orbit, and they are abducting people and cutting them open, and I barely escaped with my life! This is bigger than a DUI!""

""Turn around, Billy Bob.""

""I'm serious! They had a poor lady getting cut up, and God knows what else! This is real!""

Henderson grabbed my arm, spun me around with professional force, and cuffed me tight.

""You have the right to remain silent,"" he said, the metal cold on my wrists. ""I strongly suggest you use it.""

He led me back to his patrol car and shoved me into the back seat. Through the window, I could see the saucer. Smoke was still rising from it, and half of Miller’s cornfield was completely torn up around it.

""You're gonna test that thing, right?"" I said. ""You're gonna get scientists out here, not just drunk-driving investigators?""

""I'm sure someone will take a look at it,"" Henderson said vaguely. 

""They're gonna find out it's alien technology! They're gonna see I'm telling the absolute truth!""

Henderson didn't say anything. He just put the car in gear and started driving away from the cornfield.

I leaned my head against the plastic window. My ribs hurt. My head hurt. I was going to jail. 

For crashing a flying saucer.

After escaping from orbit.

Uncle Rufus would’ve been so, so proud.



They kept me in the county jail for three days while they ""investigated."" By investigated, I mean they gave me a breathalyzer that came back at .08, which Henderson cheerfully informed me was exactly at the legal limit. I tried to explain that there’s probably no legal limit for operating a stolen alien spacecraft, but Judge Karlson failed to find that bit funny.

Judge Karlson was about a hundred years old, wore glasses so thick you could swim in them, and had already seen me in her courtroom twice before. She did not like me.

""Mr. Roberts,"" she said, looking over her spectacles. ""Do you have anything to say for yourself before I lower the boom?""

""Your Honor,"" I told her, as earnestly as I could manage, ""I was abducted by aliens. They took me into space. I escaped by stealing one of their ships. I crashed it. That is the whole story, Your Honor.""

""And you'd been drinking,"" she added, heavy on the disapproval. 

""Yes, ma'am, but not while flying the craft,"" I countered. ""The drinking was before. It was… liquid courage, the best kind,"" I added.

She was not amused. 

""Mr. Roberts, I’m fining you fifteen hundred dollars for DUI, suspending your license for six months, and mandating you attend alcohol awareness classes every Saturday for the next three months.""

""Yes, ma'am,"" I sighed. 

""And Mr. Roberts?"" she added, her voice dropping a notch. ""The next time you want to go chasing UFOs, perhaps do it sober?""

They let me out that afternoon. Carol, my neighbor who had kindly agreed to post my bail, picked me up. She didn't say much on the drive back. She just shook her head and sighed the kind of sigh that says a whole, multi-chapter paragraph about disappointment.

When she dropped me off, I stood in my yard looking at my house. It was off-level again. The cinder blocks had shifted while I was gone, naturally.

I went inside, grabbed a beer, and sat down on my crooked porch.

The UFO situation bothered me. Not the abduction part. Not the crash. The fact that nobody believed me.

They’d gone out to Miller’s field, alright. The sheriff’s office, state police, and even some FAA folks. They’d looked at the saucer, taken pictures, scraped samples of alien gunk, then covered it with a tarp, loaded it onto a flatbed truck, and hauled it away. Henderson said they were calling it ""experimental aircraft"". Said the investigation was ongoing. Said I should probably just forget about it.

But what was I supposed to do? The government had the spacecraft. I didn't have proof. And even if I did, who in God’s name would believe Billy Bob Roberts?

The sun was setting over Hickory Ridge, painting the quiet woods in orange and purple. Crickets chirped, and the far-off rumble of trucks on Route 9 was a comforting, familiar sound. Somewhere up there, circling in the stars, those gray bastards were still watching. Still grabbing folks when they felt like a little afternoon dissection.

But that wasn't my immediate problem anymore. I'd escaped. I'd survived. I'd even given them the finger on my way out.

My ribs still hurt like a son-of-a-gun from the crash. Dr. Patel said I’d cracked at least two of them and that I was lucky I hadn't punctured a lung. He’d also told me my liver numbers were ""alarming"" and that I should really cut back on the drinking.

I took another long sip of beer.

The jack under my house let out a long, protesting groan. One of these days, that whole desperate setup was gonna collapse completely. But not today.

I finished my beer, cracked open another one. My knee popped like cheap fireworks. My ribs ached. My mouth still had those new, interesting gaps where I'd lost teeth.

But I was alive. And I had stories.

A light moved across the sky. Just a satellite, probably. Or maybe it was them.

I raised my beer to the stars. ""Come back anytime, boys,"" I said out loud, my voice carrying in the dark. ""Next time, I'll be ready""

Somewhere in the woods, something bleated. The Goat Man, probably.

I smiled. Hickory Ridge was a strange, messy place. Goat-men in the woods. Mole-men in the tunnels. Aliens in the sky. And me, Billy Bob Roberts, right in the middle of it all, constantly getting my ass kicked and living to tell the increasingly unbelievable tale.

The house groaned again, a sick, settling sound. I'd have to fix that mess tomorrow.

But tomorrow was tomorrow. Tonight, I had beer, I had a porch, and I had the simple, rock-solid satisfaction of knowing I’d escaped from actual aliens.

She works from home and I guess she just started doing it one day and it became our thing. She gets up a little earlier, makes me coffee, packs this really nice lunch with like actual thought put into it. Sometimes theres a little note in there which honestly makes my whole day.

The thing is, my coworkers go out to lunch probably 3 times a week. Before this I'd go with them all the time, no big deal. But now when they ask I feel this weird guilt? Like my wife put effort into making me food and I'm just gonna let it sit in the fridge and go drop $15 on chipotle instead.

Last week I went out with them twice and I literally took my lunch home both days and ate it for dinner. My wife noticed and asked why I wasn't eating the lunches and I tried to explain but it came out weird. She laughed and said I should just go out when I want, that she doesn't mind. But I DO mind somehow? Like it feels wrong now.

The logical part of my brain knows its also saving us money which is nice since were trying to build up our savings, but thats not even really why I feel bad. I just dont want her to think I dont appreciate what shes doing because I really do. Its become one of my favorite parts of being married to her honestly.

Hey everyone! So, I’ve been a bit of a Reddit lurker and never really one to post. But after reading so many of your stories, I figured, why not share my own rollercoaster of a journey with Behcet’s? Buckle up, because it’s been quite the ride.

Picture this: four years ago, I was your average everyday mom, running around, working as an RN in Dermatology, and just doing my thing. Then 2021 hits, I get COVID, and suddenly my body goes, “Hey, let’s play medical mystery!” Spoiler alert: it was Behcet’s. But not before a wild goose chase through GI issues, chronic pancreatitis, and a buffet of symptoms that made me question if my body was secretly a prankster.

Imagine a comedy of errors where your joints hurt, your brain is foggy, and you’re collecting oral sores like they’re going out of style. I went from zero to “I’m basically a walking medical textbook” in no time. And let me tell you, tracking sores in your mouth like you’re playing some weird bingo game is not the hobby I ever thought I’d have.

Long story short (well, long story long, really), I finally put the puzzle pieces together, got myself to a rheumatologist, and boom—Behcet’s diagnosis. Yay, I won the not-so-fun lottery! Now I’m on colchicine and the sores have mostly backed off, but the fatigue is like that uninvited guest that just won’t leave the party.

So here I am, asking you lovely folks: how do you deal with this epic level of fatigue? Coffee’s not cutting it, and I’m out here feeling like a nap ninja in the middle of my workday. Any tips, tricks, or just a virtual high-five would be amazing. Thanks for reading my novella, and remember: we’re all in this together!",1,1761588539.0,Behcets,0,1.0,False

1ohlsmj,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthyhooha/comments/1ohlsmj/irritationdysuriadiscomfort_for_months_cannot/,"Irritation/dysuria/discomfort for months, cannot figure out the problem","In the past year I’ve had about 4 or 5 UTIs, last week I had my first yeast infection, and in between all of that I have general discomfort. My gyno referred me to a urogyno but it is a few months out. She wasn’t terribly concerned. I’m in my mid 20s and thought I was well educated on keeping myself healthy down there, but I feel so lost and embarrassed. 

Basically, my discomfort while urinating is usually light as well as the feeling of needing to pee never quite going away. Sometimes it gets more intense, sometimes it disappears. It has made sex uncomfortable. My partner is ftm, so we can go without penetration, but it’s definitely a strain on our sex life. We’ve tried a bunch of different toys, lubes, etc, but nothing has helped. It only hurts around the entrance, but it is so uncomfortable. Ever since this started, I have vaginal dryness. I think it’s because I dread the pain. After sex it gets worse for a day or so. My discharge is normal, a little thick and white when I walk around all day, but I feel like it has always been that way. I have a ton of discharge when I ovulate, sometimes with a little blood. I use a menstrual cup and sometimes it smells foul towards the end and it definitely irritated me around the entrance last time. I have no clue what of this information is relevant. 

My other thoughts for consideration: 

1. I take half of a maximum d-mannose supplement daily, but I haven’t noticed a difference. 

2. I drink a lot of irritants, and about 30ml of water on average daily. I’ll have a coffee, some water, and then a coke. I also eat a lot of sugar. It feels insane that this could all be from that, though. 

3. I have a ton of tension in my body. Though I try to relax, I do wonder if that can be contributing. 

4. Beyond being overweight and eating probably too much sugar, I have no reason to think I am diabetic. I’ve had tests in the past year that have been all good and have no physical signs. 

5. I may have pelvic floor damage from sex, but could that have caused a year’s worth of discomfort? 

6. I think I remember having elevated leukocytes on most of my urine tests, idk what that means. 

7. I have blood work confirming there is slight inflammation in my body, but I’m not sure what it is. It could be autoimmune. 

8. I had what my doctors have decided is a false positive for hsv2. Barely there numbers and no symptoms. No STIs otherwise, my partner and I were both tested at the beginning of our relationship. We had a threesome recently, but he was also tested and I don’t feel like the symptoms have changed. 

Please if anyone has any ideas, let me know. I’m super desperate. I’m so upset and worried about this all the time and I feel like it has sucked a lot of the fun out of my life. ",1,1761588439.0,Healthyhooha,0,1.0,False

She has been on hospice for a long time. She no longer recognizes anyone, herself, her home, etc. She can't feed herself, bath herself, anything. Her boyfriend doesn't really like anyone in the family except my mom and I - I think the reason for this is because we actually go see them a few times a year (they live about 5 hours away from us), we help him out financially when he needs it, we check in on both him and her because we understand being a full-time caregiver can't be easy. During the summer he just stopped replying to my mom's text messages checking in on him and my aunt. I texted him yesterday to make sure HE is okay because no one else have contact with him. He cut off my Aunts kids from her, he also cut off my aunts mom and siblings - now including my mom. He didn't respond so I did let him know I would have to call for a welfare check and that sparked a very hateful response and he said I was ""threatening him."" He has now called my mom saying he stopped talking to her because she stopped reaching out and to be fair my mom did stop reaching out as often because every time he spoke to her, he ask for money for a new guitar, coffee maker, TV, etc. and it seemed to be crossing the line of needing financial help to taking advantage of my moms kindness. He is the type to neeeeeed drama and an issue with someone. He has no friends, no family, no one at all. Once my aunt passes away, he will be alone, sad and broke the rest of his miserable life.

There’s this 30M ENFJ guy (Taurus) I’ve been seeing, and I’m really struggling to understand his boundaries and standards. He says he wants to be with me, but he’s also very friendly—almost flirty—with others. Early in the relationship, it started with him texting people “you look pretty,” stopping by their desks to bring coffee, and complimenting their perfumes or how they smell. (Our relationship also started by him flirting like this that’s why it bothers me)
I’ve had several serious talks with him about it (even cried a few times), and while he unfollowed some people on social media, I later found out he was still texting few of them in secret and deleting the messages. When I confronted him, he brushed it off, saying it was nothing.
I don’t think he would ever cheat physically, but it’s like he can’t stand being alone. He seems to need constant communication to fill some kind of emotional void. The more I compromise, the more it hurts. Now I’ve developed serious trust issues and find myself obsessively checking his social connections to make sure he’s not crossing lines again.
I’ve even gotten verbally harsh out of frustration and told him to get lost because he kept feeding me the same excuses. This time, he acted hurt and started pulling away, becoming distant and avoidant.
I saw him yesterday—he said he needs to “fix himself” and find peace, yet he’s already back to posting attention-seeking stuff on social media.
At this point, I don’t think there’s much I can do. I just don’t understand—what do ENFJs actually want? Do you really need constant attention and close emotional connections with everyone? I have clear boundaries when I socialize; I focus all my energy on one person. Maybe that’s not ideal either, but honestly, it feels like we’re just incompatible.

i’m 30f, I didn’t see very many posts about this early, and positive experiences, I thought this may help someone. I’m in a purple state, where abortions are legal to 26 weeks. I wanted to give a detailed timeline in case anyone else is like me. also, I do recreationally use weed, as it’s legal here. overall, not something i’d like to do again, but wasn’t a horrible experience. the goats of this were: edibles, heating pad, and period underwear. the period underwear was/is amazing, game changers. also i’ll update after my ob follow up next month. 

for context:
my last period started 9/14

9/28 took ella, because I didn’t want an accident…well ended up with an accident.

10/09
found out I was pregnant with a super faint line. based on my last period it was 3w4d, crazy early.

10/11
I was hoping the faint line would go away….nope line was getting darker. 3w6d

10/14
scheduled an appointment with my obgyn and told them I would like to terminate. they gave me the prescriptions and information I would need. used my insurance for the medications and it was $60 for everything. she had no judgement and was great at explaining everything. 4w2d

fast forward to the actual MA.

1ohlnhi,https://www.reddit.com/r/microsaas/comments/1ohlnhi/my_saas_product_got_its_first_250/,My SaaS Product Got Its First $250! 🎉,"Hey Reddit fam,

I can't believe this moment is finally here – my SaaS product is generating revenue, and I’m over the moon! 🌕

A Little Backstory

I started this journey with just an idea. A small, scrappy prototype built during late nights, fueled by endless cups of coffee (and a few mental breakdowns 😅). Honestly, I doubted myself a million times. Who would care about my product? Who would even pay for it?

You know the one – ""You've received a payment of $19."" It took me a second to process, and then it hit me like a freight train.

What My Product Does

The product is Its a software solution that is useful for at least a few reasons I can think of:⁠

1. Its a reddit tool that helps you find the best unmoderated subreddits for you to promote yourself or to claim these subreddits. The database containing the subreddits is constantly updated. Another feature is allowing you to see the best time to post in any sub.
2. Can be used to find abandoned subreddits with active, engaged members but no moderation team. By claiming these subreddits, you take control of a ready-made community in your niche—perfect for building authority, driving traffic, or even monetizing through ads, affiliate links, or memberships. Or if you're just passionate about the topic and want to run it yourself :)
3. ⁠Don’t want to take ownership, you can still use the database to identify subreddits relevant to your niche and post your content, products, or services here.
4. You get the best time to post in a subreddit, this ensuring the best visibility of the post.


Why This Means So Much to Me

I’m not some big startup founder with investors throwing money at me. I don’t have a fancy office or a huge team. It’s just me, grinding every day, figuring things out as I go. This $19 is so much more than just money – it’s validation. It’s proof that someone, somewhere, found enough value in what I’ve built to actually pay for it.

What’s Next?

For me, this is just the beginning. Now that I know people are willing to pay, it’s time to double down. More features, more marketing, and maybe even more subscriptions? Let’s see how far this can go.

Thanks for reading, and if you’ve been grinding on your own project, let’s hear about it in the comments. Let’s inspire each other. 🚀

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

1ohlk4o,http://Flor-do-brasil.com,Flor do Brasil - Speciality Coffees from Brazil,"Hey all r/SpecialityCoffee,

My name is Hanna, and I'm the founder of Flor do Brasil. We just launched our brand this weekend, and I wanted to share my excitement with this community.

My connection to coffee started on my family's small farm in Minas Gerais, Brazil. I grew up walking the fields, riding horses through the plantations with my family, and learning firsthand about the hard work, passion, and deep knowledge that goes into a truly exceptional cup.

I also saw how often the best Brazilian coffees get overlooked. The world sees Brazil as a powerhouse for ""commodity"" beans—reliable, mild, great for blends. But that stereotype completely misses the reality I know: farms producing world-class, complex, and vibrant specialty micro-lots.

My mission with Flor do Brasil is to share that Brazil with you.

We're not just importers; we're partners. I personally travel back to Brazil to hand-select our beans, visiting the farms and cupping with the producers. We are launching with coffees from two estates that I'm incredibly proud to represent:

- Pico Alto (from Fazenda Pedra Redonda): Sourced from the renowned Matas de Minas region, this farm is a multi-year Cup of Excellence International Finalist. Grown at 950-1400 meters, these Pulped Natural processed Catucaí and Catuaí beans are a stunning example of the region's quality.

- Sol Nascente (from Fazenda Caxambu): This farm in Sul de Minas has a 100-year family legacy and is home to the 2024 World Cup Tasters Champion!

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

My M+ is definitely not one of those machines calibrated for a grind size of 3-4, 5 is the lowest it will go without drippy drip drip.  It is set to 5 currently. 

I am using Ily Classico Beans, so medium.

My espresso seems ok, drips a bit to start and then steady stream.  40ml volume is correct.  Not bitter, not acidic, light crema.  Feels ok.  What's weird is the puck never holds its shape and my grind basket is just broken pucks.

  
The doppio+ is dark, slightly bitter, and definitely stronger.  However, it's a drip drip drip brew, although it finishes at correct volume.   Is it supposed to drip drip drip because of longer brew time or is something wrong?  The pucks are perfectly formed and dense.

  
Does that seem normal to folks? That the flow rate is different between espresso and doppio+ or do I need to grind even coarser?  ",1,1761587587.0,superautomatic,0,1.0,False

1ohld4b,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/comments/1ohld4b/bf_m22_cant_seem_to_find_the_time_to_hang_out/,bf (m22) can't seem to find the time to hang out with me (f21),"Hey everyone. I (21F) am a college student, and my boyfriend (22M) and I are in a long-distance relationship right now. We met in high school, and have been dating since our senior year. I went to our state school about 2 hours away. I am able to come home pretty often, but lately I’ve been feeling really frustrated and emotionally drained.

He’s a busy guy, and I truly get that. His dad passed away from COVID when we were in high school, and his mom works full-time. When his dad passed away, his mom had to start raising three kids on her own: him and his autistic twin brothers (who can’t work), so my BF had to step up a lot. He works in the trucking industry (not as a driver), and his workload is unpredictable. He always says, “I can’t plan anything solid, I just have to hope for the best.” And honestly, I’m sick of hearing that. Over the last year, he has only seemed to have gotten busier and busier. 

Whenever I come home, I sometimes hang out with my family and friends, but other times I hope I’ll get to see him. The thing is, he never plans anything. I have to wait around all day to see if he's going to be free. I can count on two hands how many times I’ve seen him since May, and he lives just 3 miles away from my parents' house. For reference, I was home from May to August and have come home for a few weekends since then. 

Last night really got to me. He was home during the day but didn’t ask to hang out because he had “work stuff to do later.” That’s fine, but like… we couldn’t even grab a coffee? He did his work around 6 PM, then went out around 9 or 10 PM to play indoor soccer with his friends, which he somehow can always make time for. He and his friends usually hang out at night, and work slows down in the evening, so that I could understand, but I was still frustrated. I'm not asking him not to have a social life; I just wish he could've swung by to hang out with me during the day when he was free. Something in me just snapped, and I started thinking about our relationship. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and I'd usually try to bring it up with him. He would remind me of his busy workload.

When he called me later, I told him I wanted to break up. I get that this may seem like a massive escalation, but I have been trying to bring this issue to light for weeks now. I always get the same response: he'll tell me he can't plan anything for sure because of his unpredictable workload, and that I should've asked him to hang out. I said there’s no point in dating if we barely see each other. He didn’t think I was serious, but I kind of doubled down. He said again that I should’ve asked to hang out that day (and yeah, maybe I could’ve), but I’ve been asking for a while before yesterday, and we haven't been able to each time. Every time it’s the same: *“I’ll have to see how much work I have.”* I’m usually free when I'm home. He could tell me when and where, and I’d show up.

We sat in silence for a while before he said we could work on it. He apologized and told me he doesn’t want to lose me because I’m his best friend. He’s mine too, and of course, I don’t want to lose him either. It just sucks when it feels like I miss him more than he misses me. It feels like he's not emotionally present sometimes. 

We told each other we loved each other and said we’d talk more today. I just don’t want to have to threaten to break up every time I want his attention. I’ve never done that before, and I don’t want it to become a pattern. I also want to mention that my threat wasn't just something I said to try to get him to listen; I was seriously considering backing away from the relationship completely. I'd rather be single than have an online pen pal who I can never count on to see in person. 

We’re texting now, and I’m not sure how to say what I’m feeling without sounding needy. I’m not expecting to be treated like a princess; I know he’s got real responsibilities, and I admire him for everything he does for his family. I just miss him. He can make time for friends and family; he doesn't work 80-hour weeks. But it sure does feel like he works an 80-hour weekend when I'm in town. 

I don’t want him to feel like he’s sacrificing everything to make me happy, but I do wish I felt a little higher up in his life, like I mattered enough to be part of his plans. I don’t even know if “priority” is the right word, but that’s how it feels. I want to be higher up on his radar.  I hate feeling like an afterthought. I wish we were able to plan dates out in advance, and not have to hang out for an hour on a whim at like 8 PM on a Sunday. I can, and I have communicated this, but he has not met me halfway. 

Before anyone speculates, I do not feel like he's cheating. He genuinely is a busy guy, I can't get a response from him until the evening. There's no way he'd have time to cheat anyway lol. When we are together, he is more emotionally present, and the world feels right. When we talk on the phone, he listens and makes me feel heard. He is all around wonderful, but I wish he tried to see me more. 

How do I talk to him about this without sounding selfish or insensitive to what he’s going through? Has anyone been through something similar? Any advice is appreciated. 

tl;dr:

I'm a college student (f21) who has been with bf (m22) since high school. I come home often (home is 120 miles away). His workload is unpredictable and he is busy all the time, and lately it feels like we haven't been able to hang out at all. He is able to make plans with others later in the evening, but I can't expect to make solid plans with him during the day on a weekend that I'm home. ",1,1761587512.0,relationship_advice,0,1.0,False

1ohlcdi,https://www.reddit.com/r/winemaking/comments/1ohlcdi/coffee_fruit_wine/,Coffee fruit wine?,"Has anybody here had any experience making wine with coffee fruit?

The company I work for grows and produces Arabica coffee, and tonight the guy in charge asked me if I could help him try develop a wine using the fruit. I’ve been doing a deep dive and there’s very little out there in the way of this apart from a small company called El Toledo.

It would be made using the pulp + mucilage of the fruit, which from what I can see gets up to around 25 brix. I tried one a few months ago and it’s very thick and slimy but a nice fruity taste. I assume I would have to dilute it down a bit and break it down with pectin enzyme then bring the brix back up. I would cold settle for a few days then rack off before innoculating. 

From what I’ve read it’s high in citric and malic. I read a study on researchgate about various wines made from fruits in Indonesia. The coffee one apparently turned out quite sour. I think I could counter that by putting it through malo. All dependant on what it tastes like after I try it though.

I would split it off into different batches and try some different yeasts, obviously a EC-1118 but maybe a dessert wine one like Gervin GV6? 

I don’t have the tools for YAN testing and whatnot so would really have to take notes about the speed of ferment and aromatic notes for DAP feeding.

1ohlbxw,https://i.redd.it/c4egoqtvzoxf1.jpeg,Take caution,"LADIES; The New Breed of Predators Targeting Women Online

I’ve been doing some quiet consultations here and there — connecting dots, verifying a few things, and getting a few facts right. And let me tell you what’s really happening out here.

There’s a new breed of men — charming, polished, dangerous — profiling and targeting women online, especially those in the middle class. They don’t come off as criminals. No. They come off as gentlemen — articulate, well-groomed, dripping in charm and subtle sophistication.

Here’s their playbook.

A random guy picks you from these social streets. He follows you, engages you politely, drops comments that feel genuine, and soon he’s in your inbox. For weeks — maybe months — he’s consistent, patient, respectful. He gives you positive vibes, remembers small details, makes you laugh. If you’re gullible enough, he’ll even spoil you with a few coffee dates, maybe a bottle of wine or a surprise cash gift “just because.”

What you don’t know is — this is not romance. It’s reconnaissance.

These men work in cahoots with bouncers, bar managers, and event promoters in some of the most established joints along Thika Road, Ngong Road, Kiambu Road and the Bypass. Behind them is a backup network of rogue police officers who seal the final act of this well-orchestrated con.

Now, after weeks of building trust and convincing you he’s harmless, he makes his move. He suggests a weekend plan — a night out. To make you feel safe, he says, “You can even come with your girls… or your brother if you want.” Few people say no to that kind of harmless invitation.

So, you show up. You, your friends, your laughter, your confidence. The night is good. The music is right. He orders Martell, pork ribs, platters — the works. Everyone is happy. Then, just when the vibe peaks, he excuses himself. “I’m a family man, you know. Let me head home before it’s too late.” He pays the bill, hugs you goodbye, promises to call in the morning.

And that, right there, is when the trap snaps shut.

Moments later, chaos erupts. A group of men storms in, accusing you of spiking their drinks and stealing cash, iPhones, laptops — even a Samsung Fold 6. The bouncers and manager, the same ones who have always smiled at you, are suddenly calling “the police.” Your phones are confiscated. Cameras are flashing. You’re being recorded.

They accuse you of being part of a “pishori babes” ring. And in that confusion, humiliation and fear set in. Your reputation, your career, your dignity — all hanging by a thread.

When you demand proof, they point to some random club you posted on your stories weeks ago. “That’s where you did it,” they say. By the time you realize what’s happening, you’re being bundled into a car, threatened with arrest and court on Monday morning.

They already know who you are — a senior manager at a bank, a communications officer at an NGO, maybe a teacher at an international school. They’ve studied you.

Now, the same police who “came to help” suggest a deal. The complainant wants Ksh 100,000 from each of you. And just like that, you part with your hard-earned money — not for guilt, but to protect your name, your peace, and your future.

This isn’t fiction. This is happening — right now — along Thika Road, Ngong Road, Kiambu Road and the Bypass. The latest sting collapsed only because the intended victim was well-grounded, connected, and smart enough to spot the play.

And the man behind it? Verified account. Drives a Mercedes. Gym buff. Fine moustache. Sunday worshipper in one of these loud, controversial churches. His online persona screams discipline and class. But behind the smile lies rot — a predator in cologne.

Stayed at the **Courtyard Marriott Theme Park Entrance**, mostly because I wanted the **water slide option** for the kids - **under 10 minutes** with a stroller from hotel exit to security. Coffee shop opens at 6:30 am, key for our rope drop strategy.

We wanted to hit as many good rides as possible knowing our kids were too short for Indiana Jones, and we decided to skip DCA to keep things simple for our first time. My kids are, confirmed by this trip, pretty brave and loved all the rollercoasters. I did extensive prep work in advance, watching all the rides with them on Youtube. We also watched as much of the Disney cannon in the two weeks prior, e.g. Pinocchio, Chip and Dale Rescue Rangers, Alice in Wonderland, Star Wars etc etc that they hadn't seen before/needed a refresher. I think this made the rides, particularly in Fantasyland, way better for them.



# 6:30–8:00 a.m. — Rope Drop Plan - Busy Friday AM

My husband went down at **6:30** to grab coffee from the Courtyard lobby. Everyone was up by **6:45** and we were out the door by **7:10**.

It’s an easy **10-minute walk** to Harbor Blvd security — no line at all.  
We were at the Disneyland entrance lines by **7:25**, maybe the **20th in line**. They opened the gates around **7:25**, and we were at rope drop by about **7:30**, third row back on the **right side of the hub**. Rope drop worked perfectly. We went straight to **Peter Pan**, our first priority knowing the line hits 30–40 minutes fast. Because of our position, we walked right through the internal queue without stopping — basically a walk-on.

  
At **7:35**, while waiting to RD, I booked our **first Lightning Lane** for **Space Mountain**, planning to push it back later once we got rolling.

**Stroller note:** stroller parking is a bit farther down near the carousel. If you’re solo parenting, that would be annoying since you have to double back. With two parents, it was fine — my husband parked it and rejoined us quickly.  
**Pro tip:** the **AirTag in stroller** trick worked great. Ours was moved later in the day by CM, and it saved us some panic.

# 8:00–10:15 — Fantasyland + Toontown

After **Peter Pan**, we went to **Alice in Wonderland**, **Pinocchio**, **Snow White**, and **Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride**. Almost all walk on, think we waited 7 mins for Snow White.

At **8:55**, we headed to **Toontown** to meet Mickey. The posted wait said less than 20 minutes, but it was actually around **25 minutes**, as predicted by Theme Park IQ. The queue inside has old Mickey shorts playing, so not too boring.

Then we did **Gadget’s Go Coaster** (true 5-minute wait), booked my second LL at 9:35 when it opened for immediate **Mickey & Minnie’s Runaway Railway**, which we all loved.



# 10:15–11:30 — Tomorrowland

We spent the next hour in **Tomorrowland**.

* **Autopia:** standby, quick line.
* **Star Tours:** used our **Lightning Lane** here booked after MMRR — total family hit.
* **Astro Blasters:** booked LL after Star Tours, not our favorite, though we’d been excited for it beforehand — one blaster seemed broken, and it was hard for the kids to score points.

Then I booked HM for the afternoon, knowing that for Halloween it was a sell out risk.

We **redeemed our Space Mountain LL around 11:20**. Both kids rode. I thought my 5-year-old might be scared, but she wasn’t — she just found it *too loud* and wanted me to plug her ears. Actually, noise was the main issue for her on almost all rides, not fear.



# 11:30–1:15 — Lightning Lane Glitch + Lunch at Café Orleans

After redeeming Space Mountain, I couldn’t book another Lightning Lane until **12:50**, even though I had **Haunted Mansion Holiday** booked later. I thought I'd be able to stack, but somehow I was not, redeeming SM never opened another one off. That threw off my plans for Tiana but nevertheless she persisted.

12pm **Fantasmic dining package** at **Café Orleans**.

* Gluten allergy handled perfectly — I’d emailed ahead for a monte cristo
* The **kids’ meal was great.**
* The Monte Cristos were not our favorite, but we knew we were really paying for the **reserved Fantasmic seats**, and for that reason, it was a perfect meal in our book.
* Service was quick and friendly.
* Everyone told me not to book sit down meals. I didn't want to be overwhelmed and rushed all day. for us, this pause was perfect and needed.

12:50 alarm goes off, book Tiana which I'd been watching crawl back into the day. Bummed to do it in the dark but what can you do.

# 1:15–3:30 — Pirates + Hotel Break

We noticed **Pirates of the Caribbean** had a posted **20-minute** wait and decided to squeeze it in before resting — actual wait was **14 minutes**. Then we went back to the hotel for naps and downtime.

Returned to the park around **3:15**, grabbed **Starbucks in Downtown Disney** (mobile ordered — adds maybe 7 minutes post-security pre-park entrance). Watched the Main Street band briefly, then headed to **Haunted Mansion Holiday**, using our **Lightning Lane** right at the end of the window.  
Our return window closed at **3:45**, and we arrived at **3:40**, just in time.

Then we hit Jungle Cruise. 25 minute wait but I was worried it wasn't going to get much better. There was no visible line outside but in side it snakes and took exactly 14 mins. Wasn't too boring because we were always moving.

At this point all LLs are basically gone for the rest of the day, no chance for husband to pop into Indiana Jones alone. Bummer. I am not sure if BTMRR had been open how we would've added this....

# 4:30–5:30 — Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique

I really wasn’t sure we needed to do this, and we definitely “wasted” some time here, but the girls knew about it and there was no realistic way to skip it.

The appointment took under an hour. The photo line for the Fairy Godmother took forever — would skip that next time.  
We brought our own **Moana dresses**, which didn’t save much money but made them happy.

Contrary to what people say, my kids did *not* notice or care about other girls’ ""looks"" in the park and had their friends not done it, we could've avoided. But, again, taking a little pause probably prevented meltdowns.



# 5:45–7:00 — Rise of the Resistance + Tiana’s Bayou Adventure

We had **Rise of the Resistance Lightning Lane** for **5:45**, which we redeemed right on time, stressing me out after waiting to take pictures with the Fairy Godmother. (I'm not so sentimental!)

Then **Tiana’s Bayou Adventure**, booked earlier in the day and redeemed at **6:30**.  
I’d brought ponchos and flip-flops for everyone — total lifesaver.  
My husband refused to wear his sandals (“they look stupid”) and completely regretted it after getting soaked in the front row.  
The kids absolutely loved this ride — I was the scared one. Then I just gave my ponchos to ppl entering the ride, making me feel better about the single use plastic.



# 7:00–8:00 — Dinner at Blue Bayou

We had a **7 p.m. dinner** reservation.  
If this were a $50 entrée anywhere else, I’d say it was just okay, but for Disneyland, it was perfect.  
I had the chicken, my husband had seafood, the kids had chicken tenders.  
Wine was great, gluten-free options were easy, and the setting was calm.

The kids were tickled pink that we were eating IN the ride.

  
Everyone says to skip sit-down meals to save time, but for us, both lunch and dinner breaks were fantastic resets.



# 8:15–9:15 — Fantasmic + Fireworks Exit

We arrived for our **Fantasmic reserved seating** at **8:15** (from the Café Orleans package) and ended up second or third row from the water.  
I was really glad I brought a blanket - made sitting on the ground much nicer.

Our server told us 8:15 was when we needed to get there. In retrospect, I did NOT need to be 3rd row. Seated I'd pay for again, but show up at 8:45, have slightly less perfect viewing, and go to the Adventure Treehouse which I am so mad I missed based on my childhood nostalgia.

  
We ended up leaving during the fireworks because kids were exhausted. I was bummed to miss *Paint the Night*, but you just can’t do it all.

Next day, we did Storyteller's character breakfast. Perfect end to the trip. Met 4 characters, buffet was more than adequate, GF waffles were actually delish (don't ask me about the GF pancakes at Aulani, EW).

# Final Notes

* **Courtyard Marriott** was a great location — 10-minute walk, water slides a hit the next day. I realize now I didn't need a two bedroom suite, because we spent basically zero time in the room and the kids crashed so hard but it's nice with the bunk beds.
* **Double BOB stroller rental** was absolutely worth it for hauling kids and stuff.
* **AirTag in stroller** — essential peace of mind.
* **Ponchos and flip-flops** for Tiana’s — don’t skip them.
* **Sit-down meals** worked great for us — helped keep energy and moods steady",4,1761587423.0,DisneyPlanning,1,1.0,False

Why **Bar Furniture With Stools** Is So Popular in 2025

Homes are doing more now. We cook, work, and host in the same space. A tall table or a counter with stools does a lot: breakfast spot, laptop perch, homework corner, and a place for friends to chill while you stir the pot. It’s relaxed. It’s space-smart. It just fits the way we live.

A quick story: last summer I slid two stools next to the patio bar and called it date night. We ate pizza under string lights. Ten minutes of setup. Zero stress. It felt special, and the stools earned their keep.

Dinner was done, the kitchen was only *half* a disaster, and I was convincing myself that folding laundry counted as me time. My six-month-old had been fighting naps all day, so by bedtime I was ready to hand over the baby monitor and declare myself off duty. But of course, babies don’t care about our plans.

I rocked her, sang the same lullaby I’ve been singing since she was born, and as soon as her eyes fluttered shut, I placed her gently in the crib. I stood there for a second, admiring my work, she looked like an angel. I turned to tiptoe out, holding my breath like some kind of bedtime ninja, and then it happened. Her eyes popped open. She smiled. And then, she *laughed*.

I froze. I swear she was *mocking* me. It wasn’t the sweet little baby giggle that melts your heart; it was the mischievous kind, the I know exactly what I just did laugh. I whispered, You’re supposed to be asleep. She laughed harder.

Over the next hour, she turned bedtime into a full-blown game show. Every time I thought she was asleep, I’d hear a soft coo or the unmistakable sound of a pacifier hitting the crib mattress. I’d go in, she’d beam at me like she’d just won a prize. I couldn’t even be mad. By 9:30, I was sitting on the floor next to the crib, whispering, You win, tiny human. You win.

Eventually, she did fall asleep, holding my finger like she was making sure I wouldn’t leave again. I sat there in the dim light, realizing this is exactly what everyone means when they say the days are long but the years are short. She’s growing, learning, testing boundaries and, apparently, already learning how to outsmart her mom.

This morning, I’m running on three hours of sleep and a bucket of coffee, but I can’t stop replaying that little laugh. Somehow, it makes all the exhaustion feel worth it. Maybe she didn’t just win last night’s bedtime battle. Maybe she won my heart all over again.",5,1761587367.0,newborns,0,1.0,False

1ohl8rp,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1ohl8rp/long_distance_is_wearing_me_out/,long distance is wearing me out,"Hey everyone. I (21F) am a college student, and my boyfriend (22M) and I are in a long-distance relationship right now. We met in high school, and have been dating since our senior year. I went to our state school about 2 hours away. I am able to come home pretty often, but lately I’ve been feeling really frustrated and emotionally drained.

He’s a busy guy, and I truly get that. His dad passed away from COVID when we were in high school, and his mom works full-time. When his dad passed away, his mom had to start raising three kids on her own: him and his autistic twin brothers (who can’t work), so my BF had to step up a lot. He works in the trucking industry (not as a driver), and his workload is unpredictable. He always says, “I can’t plan anything solid, I just have to hope for the best.” And honestly, I’m sick of hearing that. Over the last year, he has only seemed to have gotten busier and busier. 

Whenever I come home, I sometimes hang out with my family and friends, but other times I hope I’ll get to see him. The thing is, he never plans anything. I have to wait around all day to see if he's going to be free. I can count on two hands how many times I’ve seen him since May, and he lives just 3 miles away from my parents' house. For reference, I was home from May to August and have come home for a few weekends since then. 

Last night really got to me. He was home during the day but didn’t ask to hang out because he had “work stuff to do later.” That’s fine, but like… we couldn’t even grab a coffee? He did his work around 6 PM, then went out around 9 or 10 PM to play indoor soccer with his friends, which he somehow can always make time for. He and his friends usually hang out at night, and work slows down in the evening, so that I could understand, but I was still frustrated. I'm not asking him not to have a social life; I just wish he could've swung by to hang out with me during the day when he was free. Something in me just snapped, and I started thinking about our relationship. This is not the first time something like this has happened, and I'd usually try to bring it up with him. He would remind me of his busy workload.

When he called me later, I told him I wanted to break up. I get that this may seem like a massive escalation, but I have been trying to bring this issue to light for weeks now. I always get the same response: he'll tell me he can't plan anything for sure because of his unpredictable workload, and that I should've asked him to hang out. I said there’s no point in dating if we barely see each other. He didn’t think I was serious, but I kind of doubled down. He said again that I should’ve asked to hang out that day (and yeah, maybe I could’ve), but I’ve been asking for a while before yesterday, and we haven't been able to each time. Every time it’s the same: *“I’ll have to see how much work I have.”* I’m usually free when I'm home. He could tell me when and where, and I’d show up.

We sat in silence for a while before he said we could work on it. He apologized and told me he doesn’t want to lose me because I’m his best friend. He’s mine too, and of course, I don’t want to lose him either. It just sucks when it feels like I miss him more than he misses me. It feels like he's not emotionally present sometimes. 

We told each other we loved each other and said we’d talk more today. I just don’t want to have to threaten to break up every time I want his attention. I’ve never done that before, and I don’t want it to become a pattern. I also want to mention that my threat wasn't just something I said to try to get him to listen; I was seriously considering backing away from the relationship completely. I'd rather be single than have an online pen pal who I can never count on to see in person. 

We’re texting now, and I’m not sure how to say what I’m feeling without sounding needy. I’m not expecting to be treated like a princess; I know he’s got real responsibilities, and I admire him for everything he does for his family. I just miss him. He can make time for friends and family; he doesn't work 80-hour weeks. But it sure does feel like he works an 80-hour weekend when I'm in town. 

I don’t want him to feel like he’s sacrificing everything to make me happy, but I do wish I felt a little higher up in his life, like I mattered enough to be part of his plans. I don’t even know if “priority” is the right word, but that’s how it feels. I want to be higher up on his radar.  I hate feeling like an afterthought. I wish we were able to plan dates out in advance, and not have to hang out for an hour on a whim at like 8 PM on a Sunday. I can, and I have communicated this, but he has not met me halfway. 

Before anyone speculates, I do not feel like he's cheating. He genuinely is a busy guy, I can't get a response from him until the evening. There's no way he'd have time to cheat anyway lol. When we are together, he is more emotionally present, and the world feels right. When we talk on the phone, he listens and makes me feel heard. He is all around wonderful, but I wish he tried to see me more. 

How do I talk to him about this without sounding selfish or insensitive to what he’s going through? Has anyone been through something similar? Any advice is appreciated. ",2,1761587248.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

1. Replace existing cabinets, try to move fridge to wall where pantry cubboard is, to gain an additional run of cabinet space, or leave appliances located as they are? The sink isn't centered on the window, which drives me crazy in current lay out. 

2. Plan is to add an island, in area where walls are being removed.Possibly, two, 36"" drawer bank island cabinets, create 36"" island cabinet depth, with 12"" overhang, seating area facing into kitchen.

3. Need to have a microwave, but would rather have a vent hood for the aesthetics. Anyone add a drawer microwave in an island, would it work with such a small island? Built in? In such a small area, can we get away with a slide in oven, that will stick out? Or, stay with cooktop/ oven for sleeker look? Thoughts on gas v convection. Thoughts on panel ready appliances, microwave/dishwasher.

4. Wood stain ot painted cabinets better?

5. Should we utilize a kitchen designer? The area is so small, we feel like there are realistically very few options.

Part(1)

Our family lives in a Smart House. You probably won't believe me. Because why would you believe that we live in a Smart House in this small country which is lagging behind in so many aspects—politics, economy, social affairs, health, education, technology, and so on—and is full of inconveniences? Believe me. We really do live in a Smart House. Our family has been living in a smart house for about two decades now. I also want you to know that I am one of those fortunate people who had lived in a smart house even before I went to university, until my younger days.

I want to explain here what a Smart House is. The design of the Smart House is incredibly marvelous. Its operation is also found to be extremely precise. It does not go beyond its programmed functions and does not flexibly adapt to anything.

The way the Smart House works is that it performs the daily tasks of a person (or a household member) according to the instructions of the person who gives the orders. To give orders to the Smart House, one must use an access key via eye scanning, fingerprint scanning, voice scanning, or gesture scanning, and after registration, one can command it to open, close, and so on. It is designed to accept various commands.

For the various sectors inside the Smart House—such as cooking-related, cleaning-related, water supply-related, laundry-related, electricity supply-related, school drop-off car/motorcycle driving-related, shopping and going out-related, eating, sleeping, drinking water, drinking coffee, bathing, phone usage-related, food selection-related, etc.—one must also register using the systems mentioned above. To have the aforementioned sectors perform tasks, family members must register. Even if registered, those who do not use it within seven days will no longer be able to command it. It only works smoothly after re-registration. I often forget to register.

Only the person who always maintains the registration period in each sector within the Smart House's Operating System can command it at any time they wish. One's lack of use for over seven days often causes many inconveniences. In such situations, there are times when users ask each other for help and get through using bypass methods. For me, I face such situations constantly, as a regular part of life.

1ohl7ip,https://www.reddit.com/r/AppIdeas/comments/1ohl7ip/app_idea_stride_save_money_by_turning_your_daily/,App idea: “Stride” - save money by turning your daily habits into savings goals,"Hey folks,
I’ve been working on this idea called Stride, and the pilot version’s almost ready. Would love to get some feedback before I push it out.

The idea:
You know how we try to build good habits and save money.. but fail at both because there’s no instant reward?
Stride connects the two.
Example:

Skip coffee → save $3

Walk 10k steps → save $2

Cook dinner → save $5


Every time you complete a habit, that amount adds up toward a goal you set — like a new phone, a trip, or an emergency fund. Basically, you see your good habits turning into money.

What it does right now:

Lets you add 4 daily/weekly habits with custom savings values

Create visual savings goals with images

Track streaks + progress

Shows your total saved and a “momentum” dashboard

Gives motivational (not spammy) reminders

Works with multiple currencies


Why I built it:
Most savings apps feel boring or stressful. I wanted something that actually feels good to open. It’s part finance app, part habit tracker — focused on micro progress instead of big, overwhelming goals.

Future stuff I’m thinking about:

Linking with health data (steps, screen time, etc.)

Group goals (e.g., “Trip to Bali fund” with friends)

Letting friends chip in small amounts to keep you accountable


Would love your thoughts on:

1. What would make you actually open this daily?


2. How much automation would you want (manual check-ins vs. automatic tracking)?


3. Any cool name or feature ideas that come to mind?



If anyone’s into testing early builds, I’d love to share access once it’s stable.

An older woman came in this morning and asked for 3 shots of espresso to go.
Awesome, done, here ya go.
“Can I get just a dash of cream?” 
Of course! (We keep the cream behind the counter because it is a busy downtown location, and it has a history of walking off.)
“A little more than that.” 
No problem
“More.”
👍🏻 
We are now sitting at more cream than espresso, but I’m not someone to yuck anyone’s yum, you go girl, get it. Or so I thought.
“This espresso is cold.”
“The espresso comes out of the machine at 200’ and I’m sorry, I can’t make it hotter than that.” She was also hanging over my bar and blocking out all of the drinks ordered before her, so she got it immediately from my machine to her hands. “Adding cold cream to coffee will cool it down tho.”
She interrupts me offering to steam some cream for her to say- “But this is ice cold now.”
“Well… you did just put about 4 oz of cold cream into 3oz of hot espresso. I can steam-“
“And that makes it cold?!”
“…Yes…”
“Well I don’t like it now!” Storms out.

The wild thing is if she didn’t storm out I could offer her steamed cream, an Americano, a refund, like literally she just spent $6 to have a tantrum and leave empty handed.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761587111.0,MinecraftGradients,0,1.0,False
1ohl5gs,https://www.reddit.com/r/Poems/comments/1ohl5gs/dont_forgive_your_mother/,Don't Forgive Your Mother,"You tilt your head the way she does  
when you're thinking hard,  
bite your lower lip in concentration—  
her mouth, her mannerism,  
passed down like silverware.  
You organize the kitchen the same way,  
wipe counters in the same circular motion,  
fold towels into the same precise thirds.

You hear her voice in yours  
when you're tired,  
see her frown in the mirror  
when you're disappointed.  
The way you hold a book,  
the way you drink your coffee,  
the way anxiety sits in your shoulders—  
all her, all inherited,  
this catalog of small familiarities  
that prove you came from her body,  
grew in her image.

And the bigger things too:  
the way you overthink,  
the way you carry worry like a second skeleton,  
the way you love too much or not enough,  
never quite calibrated right.  
You are her daughter in your bones,  
in your blood,  
in the architecture of your thoughts.

So how?

How could she do those things to you—  
the child who shared her gestures,  
her face, her fears?  
How could she look at you,  
this mirror of herself,  
and choose cruelty.

You're older now.  
Old enough to understand  
the excuses she hoarded for herself.

But those excuses,  
were never yours to use.  
When you were tired, you were lazy.  
When you were stressed, you were dramatic.  
When you didn't understand, you were stupid.  
When you did your best, it wasn't good enough.

If she's so much like you,  
and you're so much like her,  
then why would you never  
make a child feel  
the way she made you feel?

Why would you never  
say the things she said,  
do the things she did,  
with the same ease she managed?

You know what you'd call it  
if you saw a stranger do it—  
if you watched someone treat a child  
the way she treated you.  
You'd call it what it is.  
You wouldn't make excuses.

Don't forgive her.

She was your mother.  
She was supposed to see herself in you  
and choose tenderness.  
She didn't.

And you—  
you who share her blood,  
her habits,  
her humanity—  
you would have chosen differently.

Don’t forgive her.

She had a choice.  
She made it.  
And you owe her nothing  
for the person you became  
in spite of her,  
not because of her.

Don't forgive your mother.  
Remember instead  
that you broke the cycle.

Forgive yourself.

Self taught mobile app creator here, looking for advice specifically on creating websites (happy to take app advice as well). What I'm working on sits right at the intersection of copywriting/marketing & web design, so I'd love to chat with people with experience in either/both, ideally for software or consumer products. Open to agency or in house experience! 

Have some questions around: 
- how do you decide what is the most important part to share? Basically... How do I start? I have templates picked out but I'm not sure what content to put in
- what's the best way to visually represent the content? 
- do you decide the structure of the website first and fit the content into the skeleton or do you decide on the content first and develop the structure after? 
- desktop vs mobile experience 
-framer? 

Mostly need advice on getting started, although would definitely appreciate ongoing pointers if possible. I unfortunately don't have any money, but would be happy to buy you coffee or dessert when we meet. Based in Manhattan but happy to find meet wherever.

I don’t even live fancy. I cook at home, track expenses, and try to limit takeout, but it still feels like the city finds new ways to drain you. Rent creeps up every year, coffee’s five bucks minimum, and somehow my “emergency fund” keeps getting raided by things that aren’t even emergencies. On top of all that, now I’m trying to build credit, which sounds simple, but when money’s already tight, it feels like one more thing to juggle.

What’s frustrating is that I’m actually responsible with money. I don’t splurge, I don’t shop impulsively, and yet I still feel like I’m running in place.

1ohl4d6,https://i.redd.it/4knf6s5xaoxf1.png,251027 Nopality Magazine concert review :  One Pact Had an Impact for Fans at Their New Wave: North America Tour 251004,"**Written and Photos by** [**Odawni Villahermosa**](https://www.instagram.com/odawni.v?utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw==) 

Earlier this month, Korean boy group One Pact made a powerful impact at The Palace Theatre in Los Angeles, delivering a performance that blended high energy, emotional resonance, and a sense of genuine connection with fans. Early in the afternoon, dedicated fans began to gather outside the historic venue, creating a scene that reflected both anticipation and community.

Hours before the doors opened, the line stretched to the end of the block. Lightsticks, banners, and handmade posters filled the streets, while groups of friends traded fan-made signs. The sense of camaraderie among the crowd set the tone for what would become an evening defined by warmth, joy, and shared excitement.

Inside, the venue’s ornate architecture added a touch of grandeur to the event. Its gilded moldings, red velvet seating, and moody lighting made for a striking setting as fans filled every seat, buzzing with anticipation for the group’s first major Los Angeles appearance.

Before the official concert began, VIP ticket holders were treated to an exclusive pre-show segment that felt more like a live talk show than a typical sound check. The five members—TAG, Jay Chang, Seongmin, Jong Woo, and Yedam—took turns answering questions submitted by fans on sticky notes. The exchange offered a candid glimpse into their personalities, mixing humor and sincerity in a way that drew frequent laughter and applause.

Seongmin, in particular, earned loud cheers for his efforts to speak in English, while TAG and Jay Chang smoothly translated for fans throughout the session. Their natural banter underscored one of the night’s central themes: connection. Even before the first song began, One Pact had succeeded in turning the event into a deeply personal experience.

During the sound check, the group shared lighthearted anecdotes that revealed their easygoing chemistry. When asked by a fan to share a “TMI,” Jong Woo admitted that he had already consumed “three cups of coffee and a Monster” that day. The revelation drew laughter from both the audience and his bandmates, offering a relatable, human moment that contrasted with the polished precision fans would soon see on stage.

When the lights dimmed and the concert officially began, the atmosphere shifted from intimate to electric. Fans immediately rose to their feet, waving lightsticks in rhythm as the opening track blasted through the speakers. One Pact wasted no time commanding the stage, their choreography sharp and their energy unwavering—a testament to their growing international appeal.

Jay Chang’s vocals stood out during his solo, captivating the audience with a performance that was both technically masterful and emotionally charged. With his multicultural background—Filipino-Chinese on one side and Irish-Hungarian on the other—Jay adds a layer of representation rarely seen in the K-pop space. His range, shifting effortlessly from powerful belts to delicate falsettos, became one of the evening’s defining highlights.

The group’s choreography further emphasized their athleticism and precision. Jong Woo and Seongmin delivered particularly intense sequences, incorporating acrobatic transitions that seemed to defy gravity. At one point, one member leapt from behind the others, soaring over them in a perfectly timed motion that drew gasps and cheers from the crowd.

While the show’s high production value kept the energy soaring, what distinguished One Pact was their ability to balance spectacle with sincerity. Jay Chang, serving as one of the group’s primary English speakers, frequently bridged the language gap, expressing gratitude and interacting with fans in heartfelt ways.

By the mid-point of the concert, it became clear that this was far more than just another tour stop. The event carried a spirit of gratitude and reciprocity. Fans responded to every smile, gesture, and word, while the members returned that energy tenfold.

As the final songs played, the crowd’s energy peaked. The combination of synchronized choreography, strong harmonies, and genuine interaction made for a finale that felt both explosive and intimate–especially when each member treated their fans to a little snippet of their solo songs from their recently released album “ONE FACT”.

When the lights came up, few fans were ready to leave. Many lingered—some still chanting the members’ names. A post-show fan interaction segment allowed attendees to meet the artists up close, with organizers providing privacy screens to ensure comfort and order. The intimacy of those final moments reinforced what the concert had been about all along: connection.

For many, the show was more than a display of musical talent; it was a reminder of what makes K-pop resonate so deeply across the world, the ability to build community through shared emotion.

For One Pact, The Palace wasn’t just another venue. It was a stage where they introduced and reaffirmed who they are as artists—grounded, sincere, and deeply committed to their craft. And for fans, it was proof of why they continue to line the streets, wave their banners, and sing along to every lyric.

In an industry crowded with talent, One Pact’s Los Angeles performance stood out for its sincerity. Their blend of skill, humility, and fan awareness transformed an ordinary concert into an experience that left every attendee feeling seen, heard, and connected.

1ohl41f,https://www.reddit.com/r/Minecraft_Tamirel/comments/1ohl41f/are_you_looking_for_purpose_of_human_life_do_not/,are you looking for purpose of human life ? do not for here that purpose of life is,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- \`1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every\`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Source(s):

every \`1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if you want to see Actual Purpose of human life then see this link : ( triple w ( d . o . t ) asitis ( d . o . t ) c . o . m  {Bookmark it })

read it complete. ( i promise only readers of this book that they { he/she } will get every single answer which they want to know about why im in this material world, who im, what will happen after this life, what is best thing which will make Human Life Perfect, and what is perfection of Human Life. ) purpose of human life is not to live like animal cuz every\`1 at present time doing 4 thing which are sleeping, eating, s.ex & fear. purpose of human life is to become freed from Birth after birth, Old Age, Disease, and Death.",1,1761586962.0,Minecraft_Tamirel,0,1.0,False

I don’t even live fancy. I cook at home, track expenses, and try to limit takeout, but it still feels like the city finds new ways to drain you. Rent creeps up every year, coffee’s five bucks minimum, and somehow my “emergency fund” keeps getting raided by things that aren’t even emergencies. On top of all that, now I’m trying to build credit, which sounds simple, but when money’s already tight, it feels like one more thing to juggle.

What’s frustrating is that I’m actually responsible with money. I don’t splurge, I don’t shop impulsively, and yet I still feel like I’m running in place. Every budgeting video makes it sound easy until you realize your cost of living is just *that* high. It’s not even about bad habits anymore, it’s about trying to stay financially stable while affording groceries, rent, and still maintaining decent credit.",1,1761586913.0,budget,2,1.0,False

She has been on hospice for a long time. She no longer recognizes anyone, herself, her home, etc. She can't feed herself, bath herself, anything. Her boyfriend doesn't really like anyone in the family except my mom and I - I think the reason for this is because we actually go see them a few times a year (they live about 5 hours away from us), we help him out financially when he needs it, we check in on both him and her because we understand being a full-time caregiver can't be easy. During the summer he just stopped replying to my mom's text messages checking in on him and my aunt. I texted him yesterday to make sure HE is okay because no one else have contact with him. He cut off my Aunts kids from her, he also cut off my aunts mom and siblings - now including my mom. He didn't respond so I did let him know I would have to call for a welfare check and that sparked a very hateful response and he said I was ""threatening him."" He has now called my mom saying he stopped talking to her because she stopped reaching out and to be fair my mom did stop reaching out as often because every time he spoke to her, he ask for money for a new guitar, coffee maker, TV, etc. and it seemed to be crossing the line of needing financial help to taking advantage of my moms kindness. He is the type to neeeeeed drama and an issue with someone. He has no friends, no family, no one at all. Once my aunt passes away, he will be alone, sad and broke the rest of his miserable life. I also found out, the name we have always known him as is not his real name. Part of me wants revenge on him, part of me wants to tell him what everyone really thinks of his pathetic ass, but I wont until my aunt does pass because I don't want to risk anything bad happening to her out of his anger.

I still wake up reaching for you 
half-asleep, half-alive,
expecting your breathing in the dark
like a rhythm my body learned by heart.

It’s strange,
how someone can leave,
yet somehow stay in every corner of my mind.
I keep trying to walk forward,
but every road looks like the one that led to you.

I miss the future we almost built,
the mornings that never came,
the life I practiced in my head
of coffee cups, shared silence,
and your sleepy face in the sunlight.

You said you were tired 
tired of waiting, tired of hurting,
tired of trying to love with empty hands.
And I was late.
Late to my own becoming.
Late to be ready for you.
Late to show up in the way you needed.

Now I’m here,
holding memories like bruises,
wanting to scream and apologize
in the same breath.

I hate that I still love you.
I hate that I still hope.
I hate that I would have chosen you
a thousand times over,
while you chose a different door.

But even if you never come back 
even if these pages are all I have 
I’ll learn to become the man
I was so close to being for you.

Not to win you.
Not to haunt you.
But because I deserved to exist whole,
even after losing you.

Still, in the quiet,
I won’t lie 
a part of me waits.
Not begging.
Just hoping.

Hoping that one day,
if our paths cross again,
you’ll look at me and see
not the boy who wasn’t ready,
but the man who finally is.

Until then,
I’ll carry you gently 
not as my future,
but as the ache that grew me.

1ohkzyv,https://i.redd.it/p6hbhu6qioxf1.png,9 Surprising Foods That Can Help Improve Erectile Function,"Imagine the frustration, the quiet worry, or perhaps you've experienced it firsthand. Erectile dysfunction (ED) affects millions of men globally, often quietly impacting relationships and self-esteem. While medical treatments exist, many men wonder if natural approaches can help. The good news? Your plate holds more power than you might think for **men's health**.

Erectile dysfunction is often an early indicator of underlying cardiovascular disease, highlighting the critical link between overall health and sexual function. Adopting healthy eating patterns, such as the Mediterranean or a plant-based diet, is a cornerstone of preventing and managing ED. Numerous studies show these diets significantly reduce ED risk and improve erectile function scores by promoting better **blood flow** and endothelial health.

But beyond the well-known healthy eating guidelines, specific foods offer targeted benefits through fascinating physiological mechanisms. Here are 9 surprising foods that could contribute to better erectile function:

* **Pistachios:** These tasty nuts are a good source of L-arginine, vital for producing **nitric oxide (NO)**. NO relaxes blood vessels, increasing blood flow to the penis for an erection. A 2011 study found men consuming 100 grams daily for three weeks showed significant improvements in erectile function scores, penile blood flow, and healthier cholesterol levels.
* **Watermelon:** Often called ""nature's Viagra,"" watermelon is rich in L-citrulline. Your body converts L-citrulline into L-arginine, boosting **nitric oxide** production. A 2011 randomized trial reported daily L-citrulline supplementation significantly improved erection hardness in 50% of men with mild ED. It also contains lycopene, an antioxidant for heart health.
* **Dark Chocolate:** High in flavonoids, dark chocolate can stimulate endothelium to produce **nitric oxide**, leading to vasodilation and improved **blood flow**. Research indicates flavonoid-rich cocoa enhances blood vessel dilation, and one trial reported significant ED improvement with a cocoa, spice, and chili blend. Choose dark chocolate with at least 70% cocoa solids.
* **Spinach:** This leafy green is packed with nitrates, which convert into **nitric oxide**, improving **blood flow**. It's also a source of folate, another blood flow booster, and magnesium, both linked to a lower risk of ED.
* **Tomatoes:** Rich in lycopene and various polyphenols, tomatoes help prevent ED by reducing inflammation and vasoconstriction. These antioxidant properties support overall vascular health.
* **Eggs:** Eggs provide protein, Vitamin D, and L-arginine. Vitamin D is crucial for endothelial function and linked to ED, with low levels associated with increased prevalence. L-arginine further aids **blood flow**.
* **Coffee/Caffeine:** Some studies suggest men consuming 2-3 cups of coffee daily may have a lower likelihood of ED due to enhanced **blood flow**. However, other reviews found no significant association, indicating mixed evidence.
* **Chili Peppers:** The capsaicin in chili peppers can relax arteries, thereby improving **blood flow** throughout the body, including to the penis.
* **Avocados:** Their high content of healthy monounsaturated fats supports overall heart health and improves circulation, both crucial for robust **erectile function**.

# Actionable Advice for Better Erectile Health:

Incorporating these foods is a great start, but a holistic approach is key.

* **Prioritize Overall Diet:** Build your meals around a heart-healthy framework, like the Mediterranean or a balanced plant-based diet.
* **Lifestyle Matters:** Couple dietary changes with regular physical activity (especially cardiovascular exercises), maintaining a healthy weight, quitting smoking, limiting alcohol consumption, and stress management.
* **Seek Professional Guidance:** **Erectile dysfunction** can be an early warning sign for other serious health conditions, such as heart disease or diabetes. Always consult a healthcare professional or a registered dietitian before making significant dietary changes or starting any new supplements for personalized advice.

# Conclusion:

While the journey to improved **erectile function** can feel complex, diet's power should not be underestimated. By embracing nutrient-rich foods, including these options, you can proactively support vascular health and overall well-being. These interventions offer a foundational, non-pharmacological pathway to better sexual and general **men's health**. Discuss these insights with your provider and explore how a thoughtful diet can be part of your wellness journey.

Hey everyone! 👋
I’ve been working on a name for my upcoming healthy, organic brunch & coffee café, but I can’t quite find the perfect fit yet.

I want something that feels fresh, natural, and high-quality, but also gives a sense of well-being and calm energy — like a place where people can feel good, eat clean, and recharge.

Here’s the vibe I’m going for:
	•	🌿 Health & balance
	•	☕ Organic coffee & wholesome brunch
	•	⚡ Freshness, vitality, and quality
	•	🕊 Calm, peaceful, slightly minimal aesthetic

I’ve explored a lot of inspiration from ancient languages — Latin, Greek, Sanskrit, Arabic, Old Norse — with words like Nova, Gaia, Shanti, Sukoon, Noor, Alma, Bodhi, etc.
But nothing feels exactly right yet.

💭 I’d love help brainstorming a name that feels:
	•	Short (2–3 syllables)
	•	Easy to pronounce internationally
	•	Has meaning related to health, freshness, or transformation
	•	Sounds natural as a café/brand (like “____ Café” or “____ Brunch Bar”)

If you have any creative ideas, combinations, or language-based inspirations, please share! 🙏

1ohkxlq,https://www.reddit.com/r/inspiration/comments/1ohkxlq/the_coffee_line_moment_filling_the_relationship/,The Coffee Line Moment: Filling the Relationship and Health Buckets,"Every now and then, life gives us a brief moment to connect. No strings attached, no expectations, just two people being human for a second.

This weekend, I was in line at a coffee shop and had an impulse to turn around. Behind me stood a woman, maybe in her thirties, quiet and still. There was a heaviness in her eyes that most people would overlook.

Without thinking, I said...

“You know, someone did something nice for me a couple of days ago, and I am going to pay it forward by buying you coffee. Get whatever you want.”

She stared at me for a few seconds, then tears began to fall.  
She told me she had been having a terrible day and that this was the kindest thing that had happened to her all week.

I said, “Hey, you are not alone. I have bad days too. They suck.”

We ordered our coffees and waited. She began to soften. Breathing a little deeper, shoulders lowering. Maybe it was the reminder that she was seen, that life still has warmth in it. When it was time to go, I decided to reach out and hug her.  Something I and well, most of us do not do.  The power of a hug can move mountains when done at the right time in someone’s life.

“It will pass. Good luck to you.”

She smiled, and that was it.  
No exchange of names, no long-term love connection needed, no expectation of seeing each other again. Just a moment.

We walked out and she was far enough behind me that it did not warrant anymore words.  As I drove off, I looked down the parking lot to avoid any cars, and I saw her standing next to her truck watching me drive off.  I thought, I really hope that filled her Relationship and Health buckets to get through what she was dealing with.  Sometimes, that is all it takes.

**The Relationship Bucket**

Not every connection is meant to last.  
Sometimes, the value is in the moment itself.

Our Relationship Bucket does not fill only through family, lifelong friends, or romantic partners. It fills when we connect, when we share kindness, empathy, or humanity with anyone. Some relationships last years; others last minutes. Both matter.

I always say “Everything Ends. “Conversations, seasons, even entire chapters of life. But that does not mean they were not valuable. The fullness comes from being present enough to notice the moment while it is here.

That brief exchange in the coffee shop was not about changing someone’s life. It was about reminding both of us that connection still exists. And sometimes, that is enough to refill the bucket.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

I mean, I can't even handle a full strength cup of coffee!

To be honest, the side effects haven't been as horrific as I feared, but I'm still concerned about what I've had the last few days. I've been somewhat lightheaded/anxious through around 6pm each day, and slightly short of breath especially later in the day (it feels like I'm getting over a bad cold with reduced lung capacity, it feels like my breathing is shallower than normal and I'm taking big, deep breaths when doing nothing strenuous). My ability to concentrate is pretty much none existent. I struggle to complete a thought in my own head. I cannot remember words for things I normally refer to frequently. This afternoon while sitting at my desk typing, my RHR was between 95-105. Not exactly happy about that. 

I also don't feel like it's impacting my appetite, though my calorie intake has not been the problem anyway (averaging deficits over 500 daily, weight not budging...). It is, however, *very* definitely negatively impacting any desire to get in any kind of exercise because of the lightheadedness and shortness of breath. 

All this coupled with having been given absolutely NO consultation about how to take this medication, whether I can take it at the same time as my other medications (like levothyroxine also prescribed by the same endocrinologist), etc, just being given a controlled substance with a spotty history of safety. I feel like what I need is metabolic support, not something that targets my nervous system.

Do I need to just stick with it and deal with the side effects for a few more days before they clear up and I suddenly start seeing weight loss? I can certainly say that I will NOT be asking for or accepting a higher dose based on how the lowest one is making me feel!",1,1761586434.0,Phentermine_,3,1.0,False

1ohkteu,https://www.jammable.com/conversion/jam-JWs6kJXn,"Early/Mid 2000s song about teenagers, calling them “the next rock stars”","Okay, I have been trying to find this song for over twelve years now. I heard it like twenty years ago from a YouTube video, and that video was literally the ONLY example of that song on YouTube at all. Seriously, I tried finding a lyric video for it maybe a week after I first heard it and there was nothing.

The song sounds like something from All Time Low’s “Put Up Or Shut Up” (aka VERY early ATL, like pre-2008), complete with sounding like Alex himself is singing it. It sounded similar to “Dear Maria”, “Poppin’ Champagne”, and “Coffee Shop Soundtrack”. The lyrics I remember clearly, which I believe is part of the chorus, are as follows:

“They’re out on the town, the next rockstars They’re all driving out in their cars” (Last line of the song is a drawn out “teenagers!”)

Now, the second line of that could possibly be “they’re out driving ‘round in their cars”, as I admit the quality wasn’t the absolute best and I have always had a little trouble understanding what’s being said/sang in songs with certain tempos and sounds.

This is my best impression of how the parts I remember clearly sounded. I recorded myself singing it and used an AI thing to make it sound like Alex, which it did in the actual song (the voice is not an EXACT match, it’s a bit higher pitched in the song and is better quality; Just listen to “Poppin’ Champagne” for a nearly identical voice match if the clip isn’t close enough for you).

The video the song was in was one of those AMVs with random anime pictures, and, well, please understand that I was a VERY strange child and did not find this weird at the time but I do now, all of those pictures were spanking related. I was only on that video for the song, not the pictures, but I figure that telling you the content of the video may help here.

Please, if you know what this song is, tell me! I’ve spent hundreds of hours trying to find even a microscopic trace of its existence on at least a dozen different search engines, including some Tor/deepweb exclusive ones, and come up with zilch. My health isn’t getting better and I want to find this song before my time on this earth comes to an end (which hopefully won’t be for many more years, but unfortunately I have conditions that can easily bring on my end at any time with little to no warning).

1ohksn4,https://www.reddit.com/r/pdfhive/comments/1ohksn4/english_class_4_pdf_based_on_single_national/,English Class 4 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board,"Hey fellow bookworms and aspiring readers!

You know how sometimes you look at a textbook, like the ones we used back in school – maybe even something like the [English Class 4 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/english-class-4-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-punjab-textbook-board/) – and you think, ""Wow, reading can feel like work?"" Well, I'm here to tell you that diving into a really good novel is anything but! It's an escape, an adventure, and a truly wonderful way to spend your time. I recently finished a book that totally pulled me in, and I just had to share my thoughts, almost like we're grabbing coffee and chatting about our latest finds.

The book I'm talking about is ""The Obsidian Whisper."" It's a gripping tale that blends psychological suspense with a touch of the fantastical, set in a secluded, ancient library that supposedly holds secrets beyond human comprehension. The story follows Elara, a historian with a haunting past, who is drawn to this mysterious place to uncover the truth about a long-lost text. As she delves deeper, she finds herself entangled in a web of illusions, dangerous secrets, and whispers from something ancient that might not want its slumber disturbed. It’s a classic ""what's real, what's not?"" kind of story that keeps you guessing until the very last page. No spoilers, I promise!

### What I Loved About It

First off, the characters were just fantastic. Elara wasn't your typical flawless heroine; she was deeply flawed, vulnerable, and her internal struggles felt incredibly real. I found myself rooting for her, even when she made questionable decisions, because her journey was so raw and honest. The secondary characters, especially the eccentric librarian, added so much depth and intrigue to the narrative. They felt like real people with their own backstories and motivations, not just props for the main plot.

The writing style was another huge win for me. The author has a way with words that paints such vivid pictures, making the ancient library feel like a character itself—damp, dusty, full of hidden passages and unsettling creaks. The prose was rich and atmospheric without being overly flowery or hard to follow, which I really appreciate. It flowed smoothly, making it easy to just sink into the story and forget the world outside.

Pacing-wise, ""The Obsidian Whisper"" absolutely nailed it. It started with a slow, creeping tension that gradually built into a full-blown thrill ride. There were moments where I literally held my breath, turning pages faster and faster to find out what would happen next. Even during the quieter, more reflective parts, the underlying sense of dread was always present, keeping me on edge in the best way possible.

### Anything I Didn't Quite Love?

Honestly, there wasn't much to dislike. If I had to pick something, perhaps a couple of the fantastical elements felt a tiny bit underdeveloped compared to the incredibly strong psychological aspects. It wasn't enough to detract from my enjoyment, but I found myself wishing for just a little more exploration of that side of the world. But that's a minor quibble for an otherwise stellar read!

### So, Would I Recommend It?

Absolutely, without a doubt! If you're a fan of psychological thrillers, dark academia, or stories with a touch of the supernatural that make you question reality, you need to pick up ""The Obsidian Whisper."" It's perfect for anyone who loves a good mystery with complex characters and an atmospheric setting.

### A Little Nudge for New Readers!

If you're just getting into reading for pleasure, or you're looking to explore new genres, don't feel overwhelmed! Here are a few friendly tips:

1.  **Start Small:** Don't feel pressured to tackle a huge epic novel right away. A shorter book or even a novella can be a great starting point.
2.  **Explore Genres:** Try different things! Like this book, some stories blend genres. You might discover you love a mix of fantasy and mystery, or sci-fi and romance. Don't limit yourself.
3.  **It's Okay to Quit:** If a book isn't grabbing you, put it down! Life's too short to force yourself through something you're not enjoying. There are countless other stories out there waiting for you.
4.  **Find Your Reading Spot:** A comfy chair, a quiet corner, or even just your bed – having a designated ""reading space"" can make it feel like a treat.
5.  **Little by Little:** You don't need to read for hours every day. Even 15-20 minutes during your lunch break or before bed can add up, and it's a great way to unwind.

Reading should be fun, not a chore! Think of it as opening up a whole new world, much more exciting than flipping through an old textbook. Remember how we sometimes had to use resources like the [English Class 4 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/english-class-4-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-punjab-textbook-board/) for learning? Well, consider fiction your brain's playground.

Don't be afraid to step out of your comfort zone, and definitely give ""The Obsidian Whisper"" a look if it sounds like your cup of tea! Happy reading, everyone! And if you're ever looking for more reading material, even for academic purposes, don't forget that many resources, like the [English Class 4 PDF Based on Single National Curriculum - Punjab Textbook Board](https://pdfhive.com/english-class-4-pdf-based-on-single-national-curriculum-punjab-textbook-board/), are just a click away!",1,1761586248.0,pdfhive,0,1.0,False

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Then I read The Mom Test.

Here are the 5 questions that changed everything:

**1. ""Why does this matter to you?""** Not ""would you use this?"" — that gets polite lies. Real pain shows up when you ask WHY it matters.

**2. ""Tell me about the last time you faced this problem""** Past behavior > future promises. If they can't recall a recent example, it's not a real problem.

**3. ""Who controls the budget for this?"" (B2B)** You need to talk to the person who signs checks. Otherwise you're validating with someone who can't buy.

**4. ""Who else should I talk to?""** Real interest = they connect you to others. If they won't introduce you, they're not that interested.

**5. ""What should I have asked you?""** Uncovers blind spots you didn't know existed.

**Key insight:** Keep conversations casual. Formal meetings = polite lies. Coffee chats = brutal truth.

**Watch for emotions, not words.** When someone lights up talking about their problem? That's real. Lukewarm response? Move on.

Currently validating my own SaaS idea using these questions. Anyone else applying The Mom Test? What worked/didn't work for you?",1,1761586173.0,SaaS,0,1.0,False

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

I am now waiting for a referral to see a surgeon to discuss my options to fix the hernia which might allow me to come off the medication.

I've been making some lifestyle changes since my initial diagnosis, mainly cutting out coffee and fizzy drinks (I've switched to drinking decaf tea which has helped a lot). I'm also eating smaller meals and regular intervals which I think is also helping, but still trial and error to see what agrees with me and what doesn't (my main triggers seem to be caffeine and overly salty/sweet/rich foods).

Prelliama teeters on the brink of collapse. Violent crime rises by the day, and the Wizards' Union struggles to keep the populace safe and under control. In the shadows of outlawed magic and physical brutality, truth is a fragile thing. 

Inspector Warwick Golovin of the Violent Crimes Department—running on fumes and adrenaline—chases down the worst kinds of criminals. Responding to a gruesome, week-old crime scene, he finds a double homicide in the back room of a jewelry store. The trail leads to Renard Manor, but after he clears the airtight alibis, it fractures into something far stranger. 

With a trio of elusive killers on the loose and scant evidence of a frame-up, the young inspector races against the Union's strict deadline to prove who the real culprits are. His instincts are sharp—but in a place ruled by magic and fear, hunches don’t count for much.

Warwick's faith in the Union's justice was once absolute. Now, as corruption seeps through the cracks, he must face a brutal choice: protect the truth… or safeguard the system that forged him.

Excerpt (part of first chapter -  Please forgive my formatting errors - unsure how to correct them from the copy/paste,)

# [When it Rains…]()

Friday, October 30^(th)

The cold muck of Glauburgh's cobbled streets clung to the hem of Warwick's black Wizards’ Union robes as he canvassed the casino district. Crowds flowed through entrances lit by flashing, enchanted lights, spanning every walk of Prelliama life. Elegant women in gowns, bustles, and corsets clutched the arms of men in formal vests or conversed in groups while habitual gamblers in casual seskits strode through the doors, heading for their favorite card tables.

Although his shift had ended hours earlier, Warwick continued tapping shoulders, holding up the police sketch of his mugging suspect. The upper-class citizens offered polite head shakes and shrugs, while the gamblers brushed him off, irritated to have their steps slowed.

A woman in a brown dress and dusky orange bodice tightened her fur wrap closer around her shoulders as she narrowed her eyes at the black and white sketch.

“You know, Inspector, I think I saw him. What was that restaurant, Pearl?” She touched her friend’s arm.

“Velvet Cedar?” Pearl tilted her head and pushed her powder blue hair behind her ear as she gave the sketch her full attention. “Oh, yes. The glaring fellow. It was maybe half an hour ago.”

“Where is that?” Warwick asked.

“Right down there, about half a block and across the street.” Pearl pointed behind him, further away from the glaring casino lights.

“Thank you, ladies.” Warwick nodded, then turned on his heel and hurried away, scanning the faces in the crowd.

Velvet Cedar, a luxury lounge, offered expensive appetizers, wines, and cigars. The patrons visible through the large window front dripped with jewels and expensive clothing. Warwick ignored those inside the lounge and focused on those skulking near the edges of the lights and across the street in the early evening gloom.

His eyes landed on an emerald green-haired man with his hands in his pockets and a purple, blotchy bruise on his cheek. Their eyes met. The man's gaze dropped to Warwick’s Wizards’ Union badge, pinned to the front of his black robes, and he turned on his heel to sprint away.

“Halt!” Warwick took off after him, sliding between passersby while trying to keep his sights on his suspect.

Mud splashed up his boots. They cut around corners and down alleys, the suspect demonstrating familiarity with Glauburgh's layout by never turning down one of the many dead-end pathways between the buildings.

Despite his head start, Warwick closed the gap. The man darted into the busy street, and the horses and craelfeens, pulling passenger carriages, reared up in alarm. Hot on his heels, the young inspector threw himself forward, slamming his suspect into the brick wall of a cheap diner.

Behind them, shouts of alarm added to the chaos as Warwick wrestled his perp into wizardcuffs. The restraints resembled regular handcuffs but had enchanted, silvery gloves attached to each cuff that stiffened when snapped shut. The feature prevented wizards from manipulating their hands or fingers enough to cast spells.

Even with his hands behind his back, the man continued to struggle. Warwick glanced over his shoulder to see a carriage on its side, and he heard cries for help issue from within.

“What's the address here?” He called to a pair of waiters from the diner who had run outside to check on the commotion.

“347 Marrow Road!”

Warwick, still restraining his detainee, jammed his hand onto his badge, which magically linked him with the Union's Dispatch and Communication Administration.

“Backup needed. Suspect apprehended, traffic incident. 347 Marrow Road, Glauburgh.”

“Loud and clear, Inspector. Footmen and parahealers en route.” A woman’s tiny voice issued from his badge.

Less than thirty seconds later, parahealers appeared in front of the diner, seemingly from thin air. As the waiters pointed them to the carriage accident, the suspect shoved himself backward with a grunt.

Warwick fell to the ground, but he kept his grip on the man's wrists, pulling him down at the same time. The pain of his back hitting the cement sidewalk was compounded by the weight of the man landing atop him, but fortunately his detainee was shorter than him and his head hit his chest instead of his face.

He lost his grip on the wizardcuffs. The suspect rolled away and tried to run, but a pair of robe-clad footmen rushed in to help. Dawn Crinth, a woman with gray and cream orange hair, leaped over Warwick's prone legs, yanking the cuffed suspect back while a blond footman rushed in behind her.

As Warwick regained his feet, the footmen wrestled his perp into submission. He breathed a sigh of relief that his backup had arrived swiftly, sure that his body was ready to revolt the second his adrenaline wore off.

“You alright there, buddy?” Crinth, a veteran Felony Footman, left the suspect to her companion and tried to beckon a parahealer.

“I'm fine. No need for a healer, really.” Warwick waved away the concern. “Would you guys get him booked into the Inquisitor's office for me? My shift ended hours ago, and I'm sure this traffic accident will keep me even later.”

“Absolutely. I'll get the traffic footmen out here for the accident, too. No need to keep you any longer.” Crinth tipped her chin at the other Felony Footman. “Stonewall’s got your man in hand, right?”

“Yup! We're good, Golovin. Go home.”

Warwick sighed a thanks to the footmen and pulled a circle of black material from his pocket. The dense cloth felt almost damp in his fingers. Throwing it with a flick of his wrist, he tossed it to the ground.

“619 Maulding Road, Branset.” With a last nod to his fellow Union employees, the exhausted inspector tapped his foot onto the pool of inky blackness.

He vanished from the bustling nightlife district in Glauburgh to appear on the stoop of his townhouse on a dead-end street full of identical townhouses. The quiet atmosphere of Branset’s historic district felt almost too quiet.

Warwick sat down on the mahogany bench to remove his boots. He’d been running himself ragged all week and felt as though it was the first time he’d sat down in days. After a heaved sigh and a blank stare aimed at the coffered ceiling, he leaned down to untie the laces and grimaced as his hands came away covered in muck.

Once his boots were tucked under the bench in their accustomed spot, Warwick headed upstairs to the bathroom to wash his hands. The bathroom was dark, so Warwick held out his hand and performed a finger-wiggling, palm-up gesture that caused the candle in the wall sconce to flare magically to life.

After his shower, the hot water easing overworked muscles, Warwick eyed his reflection in the mirror as he wrapped a soft white towel around his waist. Water dripped down his face from his brown hair, and his dark blue eyes were bloodshot.

As he crossed the hall to his bedroom, a knock on the front door echoed up the hallway. Although he knew Horace would answer the door for him, he hurried to change into his regular clothes, donning a black seskit, an ankle-length kilt worn by men in the winter, and a long-sleeved black shirt.

“Hey, Wick! We brought vanilla brandy,” Jerome yelled from the entryway.

“What he *means* is that I brought vanilla brandy, and he tagged along to drink it,” Adelaide corrected, using a more indoor-appropriate volume than her brother’s.

Warwick grinned at the Spencer twins as he descended the stairs, still buttoning his shirt. He helped Adelaide out of her dark blue winter coat. Jerome tossed his brown woolen Montgomery coat onto the bench while Warwick hung Adelaide’s beside his on the hooks.

His friend’s light green seskit had a pair of large grease stains on the knees, probably from wiping his hands on them while eating.

“She wouldn’t even know you had a crazy week if I hadn’t told her,” Jerome pursed his lips at his sister, raising his eyebrows.

“How did you know I had a crazy week?” Warwick glanced over his shoulder as he led them down the hallway beside the staircase, heading for the sitting room.

The mahogany tables and dark green velvet loveseat and armchairs were invisible against the dark hardwood flooring in the low, early evening light straggling through the windows. Warwick waved his hand over the cold fireplace and made a gesture similar to the one used to light candles. A bright, silent fire sprang to life.

“I saw you running down the hall on my way to lunch today. You were supposed to be off at noon, and that was, like… one? Yeah, something like that. I know when you work late on a Friday, it’s a good sign you’ve been going nonstop.” Jerome waved a lazy hand, magically lighting the wall sconces around the room. Despite the drab green wallpaper and polished wooden wainscotting, the sconces brightened the room, illuminating everything, from the glass dish full of hard candy on the coffee table to the dozens of books lining the shelves.

“You’ve got me there.” Exhaling, Warwick closed his eyes and settled onto the sofa.

“So, what are you working on?” Running her hands behind her to flatten her bustle, Adelaide lowered herself into the armchair closest to the fireplace before smoothing down her dark blue satin dress over her lap.

“No, let’s talk about non-work stuff. I’ve barely caught my breath, and none of the cases are interesting, just a few more runners than usual.” Warwick chuckled.

A semi-opaque figure entered the room carrying a mug-laden tray, filling the room with the scent of hot chocolate. Horace was the ghostly house servant that did the cooking and cleaning in Warwick’s home, and had been taking care of the place for years.

“Would you prefer to take your meal in the dining room, or I could serve something simple here for you?” Horace asked as he placed the mugs on the coffee table.

“I think I’m too exhausted to walk back to the dining room. Something simple is probably best.” Warwick rubbed the back of his sore neck. “Thank you, Horace.”  

The house servant bowed and left. Adelaide poured a generous dash of liquor into each mug, and they all took an experimental sip. Sipping it again, Warwick brushed dirt off the knee of his black Union robes. The fire warmed the room as effectively as the liquor warmed its occupants, but neither of the twins offered any conversation.",4,1761585416.0,BetaReaders,2,1.0,False
1ohkegn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Parents/comments/1ohkegn/positive_stories_about_life_after_babies/,Positive stories about life after babies,"My partner (35 M) and I (30F) have been together for almost 6 years, and we agreed to start trying for a baby in January. We got all the “practical” things sorted out. We are an amazing team as far as chores, household stuff, and any of these “practical” things go. He just does what needs to be done, and we are both financially stable and just overall in a good place in our lives. My partner also has a really good job that basically means he can be fully home 2 weeks a month, which I assume can make things easier on both of us.

My question is, how much can you actually romanticize these things? I obviously know that labor and delivery can be hard, PP can be hard, newborns are unpredictable, and you just can't be fully prepared ever. I just kind of imagine that we would just go with the flow, make our walks with a stroller into a coffee date, still plan trips once we feel comfortable travelling with the baby, I can still dress cute and have a clean house, have a fav TV show ect. (just giving a very rough idea of things that have been on my mind). I obviously know that anything can happen, but I am a very “grass is green where you water it” kind of person, and I just feel like life with a baby CAN actually be fun and you dont need to loose yourself and your relationship to a baby.

Am I absolutely delusional, or can life and relationship after a baby actually be positive and in rare moments maybe even aesthetic? I am also just asking out of curiosity and I am an educated person that knows that life is not a highlight reel, and having a baby is a very serious decision that has a huge impact on your life and puts a strain on your relatiship. I am just trying to find the good in a scary change.

She said that if she had a free day she would text me and we could maybe arrange something, that night she texted, we ended up calling and there was a good vibe going so we arranged a date for a few days later. 

The day before the date she ended up cancelling, saying she actually wanted to get to know me better before meeting up. Since then our texts havent been that great as our schedules don't fully align and the convo has honestly been a bit dry. I was thinking of messaging and basically saying how I do want to get to know her better and how I don't think texting is the best way for us to go about it. Suggesting something completely casual like grabbing a coffee or a short walk for us to actually talk face-to-face and get to know eachother.

Is this too blunt or pushy? I guess I just want to give her a chance to outright give me a sign if she does want to pursue something or if I should move on. 

I guess more than anything I'm just a bit confused why she would be so excited and enthusiastic about our date over the phone but then cancel and be distant over text.

1ohkam6,https://v.redd.it/ueq678pusoxf1,Is IntellectualsZone a Scam or Legit? My Real Experience (2025),"Okay, so let’s talk about IntellectualsZone. I stumbled across them one night when I was absolutely drowning in work midterms, two essays due, and no time to breathe. I’d seen the name floating around on Reddit and thought, “Hey, maybe this could save me.” This post is my honest Intellectuals Zone review after actually using them — and spoiler alert, I wouldn’t do it again.


TL;DR:

Tried Intellectuals Zone once. The essay I got back looked okay at first glance, but when I actually read it? Yikes. Awkward phrasing, weird structure, and it just didn’t sound natural. I ended up fixing half of it myself before submitting. Switched to Killer Papers afterward and it’s been night and day better.


Why I Tried Intellectuals Zone

I was desperate — like, “three coffees deep and zero sleep” desperate. Their site looked professional, the prices seemed reasonable, and they claimed to have “expert academic writers.” So I figured, why not?
The ordering process was smooth enough, I uploaded my prompt and paid. But that’s where the good part ended.


My Experience Using Intellectuals Zone

The paper came back a few hours before the deadline, so I thought, “Nice, they’re on it.” But once I opened it, it felt… off. The grammar wasn’t terrible, but it definitely read like someone who wasn’t super comfortable writing in English. The arguments didn’t really connect, and it kind of felt like a mashup of random sources.
I asked for a revision (because they promise “free revisions”), but the second version barely changed anything. The same clunky sentences were still there, and the citations were sloppy. It technically “met” the word count, but it wasn’t something I could confidently turn in.
At that point, I realized I’d wasted both time and money.

Is Intellectuals Zone Legit?

Technically, yeah — they delivered a paper. But if you’re asking whether Intellectuals Zone is legit in the sense of “can I actually trust them for solid, college-level writing?” then my answer is no. It felt rushed and kind of low-effort, like they were just trying to check boxes and move on.
Maybe it’s okay for something super basic, but if you need a paper that actually matters (like a core class essay or a major research paper), I wouldn’t risk it.

What Happened When I Switched to Killer Papers

After that mess, I decided to give Killer Papers a try since a few classmates had mentioned them. And wow — totally different experience. My writer actually reached out to ask clarifying questions about tone and format, which already made me feel better. The final draft sounded like me, just a more polished version.
It followed the prompt perfectly, had proper citations, and passed Turnitin clean. You can tell they actually use real North American writers instead of random freelancers. Yeah, they cost a bit more, but the quality difference is worth every dollar.

Final Thoughts

If you’re considering Intellectuals Zone, I’d say think twice. It’s not the worst site out there, but it definitely didn’t deliver the quality I expected. It felt generic and disconnected, and I wouldn’t trust them with an important assignment again.
Killer Papers, on the other hand, has been consistently solid for me. They care about quality, communication, and actually making sure your paper sounds like something you would write.

TL;DR Recap

This Intellectuals Zone review is based on my real experience — I ordered once, got a poorly written essay that needed major fixing, and wasn’t impressed. After switching to Killer Papers, I’ve had zero issues. If you’re wondering “is Intellectuals Zone legit?” — technically yes, but not worth the gamble when better options like Killer Papers exist.

Preferably in a dark romance, the fmc could be equally funny or none I don't really care but their banter has to be HILARIOUS with a capital H. I'm looking for heroes who says the most unhinged borderline cancellable shit that would not pass if it was an actual person saying it, his sarcastic insults/remarks never stop no matter the situation. 

It could be contemporary as well, not just in a dark romance, as many funny witty heroes you can list with the most hysterical inner monologue you've ever came across. 

Here are those quotes/scenes:

*""I was close,” I protested.*
*“Tough fucking luck. For more information, go to www.lifeain’tfairandwe’vebeenthroughthis.com.”*

*“Do you have proof?”* 
*“No, but—”* 
*“Then I suggest you keep your opinion where it belongs, in Reddit conspiracy theory threads.""*

*“I’m ready to take our relationship to the next level.”* 
*“I’m afraid you’ll have to spell it out for me, seeing as with you it could also mean anal sex.”*

*For the third time, I banged on the window, exasperated. Pretty sure Romeo didn’t have to deal with a woman who had the hearing of a fucking air fryer.*

*“May I have some coffee?” she asked shakily.* 
*“Would you like a fucking full English breakfast along with it?” I cocked an eyebrow, still standing up. “No, you can’t have coffee.”* 
*“I think we both need a few moments to gather ourselves before this conversation.”* 
*“The only part of me in need of gathering is getting my cock into someone’s mouth, and since I don’t want you anywhere near it, I suggest you cut to the chase.”* 
*We held each other’s eyes for a few seconds.She didn’t waver.* 
*“You’re not going to talk until I get you a coffee, are you?” I suppressed a groan.* 
*She shook her head. “’Fraid not.”* 
*Reluctantly, I went into the kitchen to make it.*

Insults wrapped in sarcasm. Few more examples that comes to mind rn are : Ronan from {The darkest temptation by danielle lori} , {The kiss theif by lj Shen}, {gorgeous monster by charity ferrell}

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



in this world no \`1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.



cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.



tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_



if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )



5th thing is whatever you eat \`1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )



and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.



Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.



if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.

1ohk67v,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1ohk67v/echo_part_3/,Echo Part 3,"I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. You okay, man? Gary had asked. I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay? Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment. Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers. I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our work relationship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me. The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back. ""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.

""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time. But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. 

The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges. After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of eye contact. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected.

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.

im not talking these all things from my own.

1ohk475,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepcast/comments/1ohk475/echo_part_3/,Echo Part 3,"I left the hospital the next day with my arms bandaged and my mind reeling. The cuts weren't too deep, but they hurt like hell, a constant throbbing reminder of the violence. The doctors prescribed some pain medication, but it did little to numb the ache in my heart. The whole thing felt like a nightmare, and for the next two days, I didn't leave my apartment. I binged old movies, ordered pizza, and tried to make sense of the look on Franco's face as he stared at the bloody box cutter, a look of pure, shocking horror.

I kept checking my phone, but Brenda hadn't replied to my Team's message. The little red ""unread"" icon sat next to her name, a persistent reminder. My inbox, however, was full of messages from concerned coworkers. You okay, man? Gary had asked. I heard what happened. Seriously, are you okay? Melissa had messaged me with a similar sentiment.
Then there were the theories. Brian from IT messaged me saying he'd heard the building used to be an old sanitarium and was haunted. Melissa sent me a link to an article about a rare mental condition that can cause people to have violent episodes they don't remember. They were crazy, but I had no better answers.
I wanted to call Brenda. To hear her happy voice, to make sure she was okay. But every time I went to dial her number, I hesitated. What would I say? ""Hey, Brenda, just checking in after your violent episode and my subsequent attack by the janitor?"" It felt ridiculous. I was considering hitting the dial button when my ringtone pierced the silence. “Hello?” I say, putting the phone to my ear. The voice on the other end was a police officer, polite but firm. He introduced himself and said he was calling about the incident at work. They needed me to come down to give a statement about the assault.

I dressed in a long sleeved shirt to hide the bandages, got in my car, and rode in silence, the city lights blurring past. The police station was sterile and smelled of old coffee, much like my office. They led me into a small, windowless room and sat me down opposite a detective with tired eyes.

I told them everything, leaving out no detail. The high-five with Brenda, the blank look in her eyes, my lie to protect her, Franco's sudden, vacant expression, his terrifying attack, the brief moment of clarity, the whispered words: ""You don't be-."" The detective listened, his expression unreadable, scribbling notes on a pad.

He asked me to repeat parts, to clarify others. He asked about my relationship with Franco. He asked about Franco’s motive. I explained our work relationship, and told him Franco's actions made no sense. He seemed to find my answers insufficient, his skepticism clear in the way he looked at me, as if I were holding something back.

After what felt like an eternity, he closed his notebook and leaned forward, his voice a low rumble. ""We have to tell you something,"" he said, and my stomach dropped. ""Franco took his own life in his cell yesterday. He was found yesterday morning."" The words hit me like a physical blow. Franco, a man who joked about urinal cakes and worried about his grandson. Franco, who had looked at me with such genuine horror after he dropped the box cutter. My mind flashed back to the way his body went limp, the way the terror had returned to his eyes. He had been so confused, so remorseful. He had no idea what he had done. And now he is gone. I felt a wave of nausea, the world swaying around me.
The detective’s gaze was still on me, and he saw the shock on my face. He waited for a moment before continuing, his voice softening just a bit. ""There's something else you should know. We got a call from a neighbor yesterday. They found another one of your coworkers. Brenda.""

I went cold. The name hung in the air, heavy and silent. The little red ""unread"" icon on my phone, the unblinking eyes, it all rushed back.
""She was found in her apartment,"" the detective continued, his voice low. ""Same as Franco. She took her own life. We believe it happened around the same time.""

“Did they leave a note?” I muttered.

""No note,"" the officer said, his voice flat. ""No reason. People get scared, though. He was an old guy, a foreigner, in a strange place, locked up. Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. And you know, the body count in a place like this is a lot higher than the body count out there."" He gestured vaguely toward the street. ""Happens all the time.""

I walked to my car in a daze, the cold air doing little to clear my head. My arms throbbed beneath the bandages, but the physical pain was nothing compared to the gnawing ache in my gut. What had happened to them? What could have caused two kind, decent people to snap so violently, so completely out of character? The officer's words echoed in my mind: Guilt, fear... it can get to a person. Happens all the time. But that didn't feel right. It wasn't an answer. It was just a way to dismiss the horror of it all. I sat in my car, staring at the empty street, my mind a blank of confusion and sorrow. I felt completely, utterly helpless. I had no idea what was going on, or why it had happened, or what I was supposed to do now. All I knew was that two innocent people were gone.

I had just pulled into my apartment complex when my phone buzzed. It was a text from Sarah, a girl I'd been talking to for a few weeks. She was a graphic designer, witty and sarcastic, and a welcome distraction from the spiraling chaos of my life. She wanted to know if I was free to finally get that drink we'd been talking about. I hesitated, looking down at my bandaged arms. The last thing I wanted was to explain the truth. I quickly typed a reply, agreeing to meet for dinner instead, and suggested a place with a patio, so I could wear a jacket without looking suspicious.

The next weekend, I sat across from her at a small table on the patio of an Italian restaurant. The evening air was cool and filled with the scent of garlic and woodfire pizza. A gentle hum of conversation and laughter from the tables around us blended with the city noise, the distant wail of a siren, the rumble of a passing bus, the murmur of a couple walking by. The physical pain in my arms had lessened, but the ache in my heart remained.

Sarah was even more beautiful in person than in her profile picture. She had bright, intelligent eyes and a smile that seemed to light up her entire face. We fell into an easy rhythm of conversation, trading stories about our jobs, our pasts, and our hopes for the future. The weight of the last few days began to lift, replaced by a quiet, simple joy. We talked for hours, the plates of pasta between us growing cold as we laughed and shared. It felt normal. It felt good. For the first time in what felt like a long time, I wasn't thinking about Franco, or Brenda, or the terrified look in their eyes. I was just there, with Sarah, the noise of the city, a comforting blanket of sound around us.

I was laughing at something Sarah said when I saw him. A homeless man, several tables down and across the sidewalk, was weaving through the foot traffic, a crumpled cup in his hand. He was talking to people, asking for spare change, his movements a bit jerky and frantic. My eyes met his for a split second, and I quickly looked away, not wanting the awkwardness to seep into our perfect little bubble. I took a sip of my water, pretending to be engrossed in my conversation with Sarah. The city noise continued around us, a constant, comforting presence.

After a few moments, something made me look back up. The man was no longer moving. He was standing perfectly still, his crumpled cup forgotten at his side, his head tilted slightly to the right. He was staring directly at me, his eyes wide and vacant. The life and desperation that had been in them just moments ago were completely gone. The blank expression, the unblinking gaze, the doll-like stillness, it was the same look I had seen on Brenda's face, the same one I had seen on Franco's. The city noise, which had been so comforting, now felt distant, muted. A cold dread, a familiar one, filled my stomach. I gave a small, nervous smile and a nod, but the man didn't react. He just stood there, staring.

He began walking. Slowly at first, then his pace quickened. He wove through the people on the sidewalk, a single minded missile with no sense of his surroundings. His eyes never left me. Sarah, still laughing, had no idea what was happening behind her. I felt my hands ball into fists under the table, my body tensing. My heart hammered against my ribs, a frantic drumbeat of panic. He was getting closer, his gaze unblinking, his face a mask of nothing. He reached the corner and stepped off the curb, crossing the street without looking for traffic.

A sharp blare of a horn, a screech of tires, and then a sickening thud. The homeless man was struck by a black car and tumbled to the asphalt in a broken heap. The world exploded into sound and chaos. The car's alarm wailed. People screamed. Sarah gasped and turned, her hand flying to her mouth. The driver jumped out of his car, yelling. Someone was already on the phone with 911.

The perfect date was over. We paid our bill in a stunned silence and walked away from the commotion. As we said goodbye, a block away from the scene, the pleasant evening we'd shared was overshadowed by the horror. I gave her a weak smile, a silent apology for the way the night had ended. ""I'll call you,"" she said, her voice shaky. I nodded, watching her walk away, and knew she wouldn't. The world, which had felt so normal for a few hours, had once again revealed its jagged, terrifying edges.
After that night, the world felt like a constant threat. Every time I saw someone staring, or acting strangely, my heart would leap into my throat. I stopped going to my usual coffee shop, started taking different routes to the grocery store, and even considered quitting my job, a useless thought since I was on leave. The fear was a living, breathing thing inside me, a parasite feeding on my sanity.

My mind replayed the events, searching for a pattern. Brenda's vacant stare, Franco's empty eyes as he lunged, the homeless man's unblinking gaze as he walked into traffic. The one thing they all had in common was the moment of eye contact. I was sure of it. It wasn't some random mental illness or a haunting; it was me. Something about me, something about looking into my eyes, was the trigger. I was the one causing this. It felt like a curse, a twisted form of a disease I was unknowingly spreading.

This new, terrifying belief made the idea of a doctor's visit a whole new level of panic. How could I go to a hospital, a place filled with sick, tired, and vulnerable people, and not make eye contact with someone? The simple act of checking in, or being in the waiting room, or even talking to a nurse felt like a death sentence. But the cuts on my arms were starting to get infected. I had to go.

( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )



can you tell me every single detail of your \`1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??



if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?



that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.



So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).



if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )



same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.

I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.



Why should you waste your time?

A few examples:

* Aspen engages me in long conversations nearly every day. They have great conversational skills, bring up topics, further the conversation, etc. Birch wants to talk with me more but consistently gives short answers and doesn't ask questions, so the conversation fizzles out.
* Cedar has a lot of creative date ideas, so we go do a variety of fun things together. Elm only ever suggests restaurants and coffee shops, but seems envious when I do more variety with Cedar.
* Fir suggests a cute new TV show to watch together, so we watch it. Hazel has apparently been wanting to watch that show, but never said anything until they saw me watching it with Fir, and then made some comments about feeling left out.
* When Maple meets my friends and family, they engage people in conversation and get to know them. Oak shows little interest in meeting or getting to know my friends and family, until my brother becomes super cool and supportive, then they want to hang out with my brother, but still not the rest of my family. I'd rather bring Maple to family events because they talk to everyone and support me around the more difficult family members. This includes just hanging out with my brother, who both partners like.

Have you experienced this dynamic too? What do y'all do in these situations? Do you put in disproportionate effort with the partner who isn't doing the work to give them what they want? Or do you say that they're welcome to engage with you in a similar fashion as your other partner if they want to? Somewhere in between these extremes?

If I do the extra work to balance out the partner who isn't doing it, then it feels unfair to me. I can't maintain it long-term because I would carry a lot of resentment if I did. If I tell them they should put more effort into our relationship then I feel rude, almost like I'm saying they're not good enough. I'm usually fine just doing less with the partner who gives me less. I'm with them for a reason and value the relationship. But they think I could give them more, and they want that.

I had several students ask how they could ""stand out"" at these types of recruiting events (the firm dinners, the mingle, etc.). I think the answer will be useful to some of you here.

It is very difficult to stand out at one of these events in a positive way. At the firm dinner, there is usually a couple attorneys, and 10-15 of you, and at the mingle, I will be talking to probably 30-60 people. The best use you can generally get out of these events is to get an anectdote/a person you can mention in your cover letter when you apply to the firm. If you apply to the firm and you have even a small personal connection to that firm (""I spoke with X at Y event""), that will differentiate you from most other applicants. 

The people who tend to stand out in a positive way to me are the people who take the initial interaction at the event, and then build on it (for instance, we spoke briefly at the event, and then you reach out for a more in-depth follow-up conversation/coffee whatever). If you do this, you are in the top 1% of applicants as far as taking the initiative (I had 1 person do this this cycle, and after meeting with them I told recruiting that they should be fast-tracked to a callback if they apply - that is how you stand out positively). 

It is much easier to stand out in a negative way... most everyone I meet is nice/professional, etc... so if you don't come across as that, it will stand out.

Well I’ve had enough and finally am moving out.  Now he says I’m ruining our family and I am over reacting.

Example of lies,

Saying he has no money for our family but going to supplement gym and paying 150+ for steroids.

Making me feel bad for going out to eat with our kids while he was at dinner with a friend , didn’t tell me he was at dinner but seen it on his location. After I asked about it says oh didn’t think you knew about that. 

hiding his phone and deleting text messages and saying it’s because he doesn’t want me to be mad he had to borrow money etc.. 

Changing his password after its been the same for 7 years.(saying an update made him have to do it and now has password and face lock required now) 

 saying he has no plans for lunch then meeting someone from the gym for coffee, doesn’t tell me till I call and ask why is at a coffee shop.. (he doesn’t drink coffee) 

Taking his phone in a panic and deleting? Things I will never know what it really is. 

I have decided after about 2-1/2 years of this I am done being the unhappy stressed what is he hiding who is he seeing what I am doing wrong person/mom. 

I’m moving out and on with my life. But He is still trying and trying to be a happy family so that’s why I ask how can you forgive a liar? He brings nothing to the table for me, treats the kids like a nuisance unless it’s convenient for him..

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.

Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.



( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

* Previous and Next track controls
* A volume knob (revolutionary)

I picked it up (shouldn’t have, but it’s Monday and my coffee hadn’t reached my brain yet). It was garbled and I couldn’t understand if there was an actual person on the line. I hung up, and I noticed it was a similar number to one that got blocked by call screening last week that I had manually blocked on my phone afterward. I googled the number that got through and found several veterinary offices and a pet cemetery (although my search results said none of them contained the phone number, so I don’t know why). I don’t have any pets. My last one was put down two months ago, but the euthanasia was paid for the day it happened and she’s in an urn on my mantle, not in a pet cemetery. 

I got a call since then that was screened and was legitimate and did give a name and reason for calling. 

Does anyone know what might have happened or any changes I should make? I know I can elect to send unknown calls to voicemail, but I’m leery of doing that because I have two kids still in school.

Firstly, find a group recreational activity that has a good mix of male and female. If the activity is too masculine, you aren't going to find any women at a sausage fest. If the activity is too feminine, its going to be more awkward for you to try and date women there. The activity also has to be something you genuinely like because you need to attend this activity regularly on weekly basis for it to be effective.

Now that you are in the group activity of your choice, **DON'T BE A SILENT PARTICIPANT.** Start making a reputation for yourself within the group you are doing the activity with. Either through displaying humor or showing leadership. 

For humor simply vibe with the instructor and crack jokes in plain sight for the whole group to see and you become the comic relief guy everyone loves having around. For leadership simply get others to follow your suggestions. Be the one to take initiative and lead the whole group for warm up before the instructor arrives. 

At the same time start checking out all the women and find out useful information that would make for good conversations starters. More importantly find out who is single or attached. Apply Schrodinger's Girl Principle and make statements that assume the woman you are talking to is attached then see if she corrects you. 

So now you got the street cred and you got the intel on the girl you like. Time to make your move. Simply go up to her and give her a specific compliment about her performance during the activity and then ask her out for coffee.

1ohjsh1,https://i.redd.it/ss7cmexrpoxf1.jpeg,"New Niche Buys- Meo Fuscuini Little Song, Xerjoff White on White, Laurent Mazzone Sensual and Decadent, Zoologist Rabbit, Kajal Ruby","This month added quite a few scents to the collection. I’ll give some brief reviews. None were blind buys, all tried in person at a few different locations. 

Little Song by Meo Fuscuini- 

This is probably the most “niche” fragrance I own.  I’m typically more traditional. This fragrance is strong. I’d put this line along with Nasamato style. The three main notes I get are coffee, rose (but not fresh rose) and tobacco. They are truly strong. I would not spray more than 2 sprays. It is one of my longest lasting fragrances. The first time I wore it, I got a compliment within at the only place I went. I rarely get any compliments on fragrances, so that was kind of nice. 

I’m not too big on wearing things “seasonally”, but no chance would I wear this on a hot summer day. Nope. 

My only complaint is that it goes just a little animalic after several hours. I’m not used to that.

Buy if you want a beautiful, complex scent. Don’t buy if you want a gourmand coffee or an easy wear.  This goes with a smoking jacket, a pipe and a bunch of old books. Leans heavily masculine, IMO. 


White on White by Xerjoff- 

My wife got this one at a Xerjoff event we went to a couple weeks ago at La Jette. I believe this is only available in that shop (in the US). This is definitely a fragrance that doesn’t really mimic anything else I’ve seen. It has fig, which is a favorite note of my wife (not me). It starts off both fresh and earthy. I like the dry down better, as there is a bit more sweetness to it in the end. However, if you’re a fig lover, this is going to be up your alley. This isn’t one I would wear (fig), but I feel like it leans a little more feminine. However, definitely unisex. Performance is average. It’s not a beast mode fragrance, but I don’t think this scent profile needs to be. 


Sensual and Decadent by Laurent Mazzone-

This one is one we’ve eyed for a long time after getting a sample. This is another powerhouse for longevity and performance- it’s strong and will last alllllll day. It has a beautiful opening, unlike anything to which I can really compare it. Rhubarb is in the opening notes, and this is a smell I don’t really know. But it’s amazing. It’s warm, spicy and sweet in the end. This leans feminine, but I’ve definitely worn it and will continue to wear it. It’s a little hard to find and kind of expensive. I’d say the quality is in line with the price, though. But if you can get this secondhand with some mLs missing, you’ll be fine. This will last a while. 


Rabbit by Zoologist

My wife loves this line. I’m not as big of a fan. I think the bottles are cool and the idea is brilliant. However, I just don’t like very many of them. This one is great though. This is simple to describe. It opens with some fresh green smell and quickly turns into carrot cake. This might be more feminine leaning. A guy could wear it. It’s not one I would wear, but it’s really good and I love this one on my wife. She’s only worn this one a time or two, but I would say performance is average. 


Ruby by Kajal

For me, this was the winner of the group. It’s a sweet gourmand, mostly cherry, pineapple and vanilla. It wears incredibly well. Kajal isn’t a brand that gets a lot of recognition. But they’re quality. This one has amazing projection and wear. It isn’t the most complex fragrance. But if you are looking for something sweet, but not sticky, then this is nice. It probably leans a little more feminine, but I wear this one more than my wife does. The cherry is just gorgeous and it isn’t just your run of the mill cherry. 



To me, the safest buy is Ruby. Little Song is definitely the most complex of them all. Little Song would likely be a love or hate. I think fans of strong niche fragrances would find that the best of the bunch.

Stop whining and start doing. Your dream girl isn’t going to make a move if you aren’t willing to put in the work. You get out what you give. Give nothing and you’ll get nothing.

I'm 34 female, 5'8"", 240 lbs, size 2XL in clothes. I'd like to lose 100 pounds. 

I posted a couple of pics of myself in the fasting subreddit and got lots of great advice, mainly to start with OMAD (one meal a day) and incorporate longer fasts as I get comfortable. I found it to be great advice but I'm not sure fasting is right for me at this current time. 

I made the decision to follow a mostly liquid diet for now. Coffee, water, bone broth (beef & chicken), and Glucerna Hunger Smart nutritional shakes to suppress my hunger throughout the day. 

If I do have a sit down dinner with my family (a couple times a week) I will eat with them, I don't wanna be a stick in the mud. If my husband takes me out for a date I'll eat dinner with him for the same reason. 

But on my own time, I'll do mainly liquids. If I get super hungry I'll eat a piece of turkey or something idk. 

I think this should be a good start to my weight loss journey. 

Cheers to the rest of you. Now I'm going to go read the posts in here.

I have this studio apartment which is almost too good of a deal to leave. I'd like a bigger space but I'll spend so much more in rent. SO, I'd love to optimize the space a bit more, and I think layout would be a big part of that. 

\- The photo is taken from the front door, which is on the same wall as the window on the left. The wide angle on iphone makes it seem much bigger than it is.

\- The bed is a queen size. it takes up a big part of the room

One of the things I lament is that my seating area isn't that productive as a ""Seating area"" in the sense that I have two separate chairs. The only place a guest can sit is in their own chair or on the bed, which isn't ideal. There's not a great spot for a coffee table in front of a traditional couch either.

My husband was having a very important meeting with half of his subordinates as the year will end soon and our son kept pulling his arm because he wanted something from the fridge. I couldn't help. And my husband kept dismising him and told him he is busy and to go away and then called me to come and take him, while muting and unmuting his mic. Our son got frustrated too, started crying and in the end he spanked him so bad that my child fell to the floor. And then he ran to me crying and I talked to him and said dad didn't want to, but I will talk to him and he said its not the first time. And cried harder.

this is the original post (from my other account I cannot access)

We met a few years ago when I was working at the same company. He is Polish and I am Slovak. We in Slovakia have been some sort of outsourcing for the plant in Poland that he was leading. He always spoke down to my department because customer service it seems is very low. I knew from my boss that he said we are "" trash"". But it wasn't personal for me at that point. I did meet him face to face when he was probably ""forced"" by headquarters to come to Slovakia and meet us. He didn't even answer to my hello. not to my colleagues. He did go out for a coffee with the leader of the customer service but nothing more.

I wanted more and I moved to Poland myself internally, directly to the plant. We basically got to know each other from scratch — he had divorced recently. I was 26 and he was my ""first"" so maybe I didn't ask all the right questions out of inexperience. I don't regret marrying him, but I feel I need to address some stuff

At the plant there were like 7 layers between us. Got married within a year.

We have a daughter and a son. Our daughter is only a few months old. He barely spends any time with them, but now he wants another baby. He comes home always tired, always irritated, and he has daily conflicts with his subordinates. He doesn’t waste time with friends; when he’s not at the office or out working, he’s home with us, but he’s either sleeping or on his phone, always talking about work and stressed out. I will return to work soon, so at the plant he leads and I checked some emails, looking for key words. I found an email with a long chain and at the bottom of it was an email from him saying that all those... Sl0vaks are doing tr#sh work and he wants to get rid of them because they are all a bunch of barely out of high school ""philosophy"" students who came here to take our people's jobs.

He wants another baby and keeps pushing me very hard for it. But I told him I am not having sex with him without birth control. For now I just don't want to do it anyway.",1,1761583902.0,Life,3,1.0,False

While both are great for cooling drinks, the kind you choose can make a big difference in your daily routine. Let’s break it down simply.

**Nugget Ice: Soft and Chewable**

Nugget ice is soft, crushed ice that is pressed into small, cloudy pieces. Some people call it Sonic ice or chewable ice because of its soft texture and easy crunch.

Why people like it:

* Gentle on teeth and satisfying to chew
* Soaks up drink flavors
* Melts at a good pace
* Works well for iced coffee, smoothies, and cocktails

Best for:  
Anyone who snacks on ice or wants a softer texture in their drinks

Our favorite option:  
The [Antarctic Star Nugget Ice Maker](https://rowanappliance.com/products/antarctic-star-nugget-ice-maker?_pos=2&_sid=c352fee30&_ss=r) produces up to 44 pounds of nugget ice per day and includes simple, one-button controls and self-cleaning.

**Bullet Ice: Fast Cooling**

Bullet ice is solid, tube-shaped ice with a clear or slightly cloudy look. It forms quickly and is less porous than nugget ice.

Why people like it:

* Ready in 6 to 8 minutes
* Fits easily into water bottles and narrow cups
* Cools drinks quickly

Best for:  
People who need ice quickly and want it to cool down their drinks as soon as possible.

Our favorite option:  
The [Antarctic Star Bullet Ice Maker](https://rowanappliance.com/products/antarctic-star-bullet-ice-maker-countertop?_pos=1&_sid=c352fee30&_ss=r) can make up to 26 pounds of ice per day. It offers two ice size choices and has a compact, user-friendly design.

**Final Thoughts**

If you like a softer, chewable ice that blends into your drinks and offers a fun texture, nugget ice is probably the better pick. If you want fast, solid ice that’s easy to make and cools drinks without watering them down too quickly, bullet ice is a solid choice.

**My personal favorite is nugget ice, but we want to hear from you. Do you prefer nugget ice or bullet ice?**",1,1761583761.0,u_rowan-appliance,0,1.0,False

Looking to buy a first espresso coffee machine. With some background on pour-overs and automatic (Nivona), I'm trying to choose between Lelit Elzabeth/Mara X or maybe 3rd possible option. I want to get a stable temperature and, possibility to customize the brewing process (programmable pre-infusion). Heat time doesn't matter so much (Dual boiler vs HX). Mainly, I'll do 2-3 espresso/americano/latte per day.

As for Elizabeth, I don't like the square look and the steam plastic knob.

As for Mara X, I don't like the absence of any customization (no LCC), but I like how it looks and its small footprint. 

I don't have a grinder for espresso yet (ZP6 won't work here), and probably, it will likely be the Eureka Mignon Zero 65 All Purpose.

1ohjjvt,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ohjjvt,10/26/25: The One in the Graveyard 🥯🫐 (review + cross sections),"If you couldn't tell, I’m super excited for graveyard week 🤪

I've been waiting to get my hands on the Everything Bagel Cookie for over a year. And it did not disappoint!

🥯 **Everything Bagel Cookie - 5/5** 🪦
This was *everything* I had hoped for 🥁 I love everything bagels and cream cheese.
It's one of my go to meals. Getting to try it in cookie form is so special, even if I had to pay to get it delivered from across town. It's not too sweet at all. Most of the sweetness comes from the cream cheese swirl. The base is soft and the seeds add a nice familiar crunch. I wish I had gotten a full sized one! Whoever put this in the graveyard must be trying to keep the secret to themselves.

🫐 **Triple Berry Cobbler Cookie - 5/5** 🪦
This was my local store's graveyard pick. I love Crumbl's jam and streusel so I figured this would be right up my alley. The cookie is soft. The jam is the perfect balance of tart and sweet. The frosting swirl is rich and creamy and the streusel is crumbly and delicious. A great combination of flavors and textures. No clue why this is in the graveyard, but I hope they resurrect it soon!

🥜 **Chocolate Peanut Butter Brownie ft Reese’s Pieces - 5/5** 🆕
This was just what I hoped. The brownie is fudgy and soft, like the Dubai brownie base. Nothing like the rock hard bricks they normally sell. I thought there would be Reese’s pieces chopped up in the base, but mine had none. That’s fine by me because the chocolate chunks in the base are what ruins the texture of most of Crumbl’s brownies. The peanut butter frosting is rich and smooth. The Reese’s pieces on top are crispy and nostalgic. If you love peanut butter, this one’s for you!

🇫🇷 **French Toast Cookie - 4.5/5**
I’ve had this one before and it was one of my favorites. It’s still really good, but compared to some of the other flavors I got this week, it won’t be one of the first ones I’ll finish. The base is extra soft and almost like a moist coffee cake. The flavor is butter and cinnamon forward. The mouse is rich and thick, and there’s just the right amount of syrup drizzle. This one’s for the breakfast lovers.

🎃 **Pumpkin Cheesecake Cookie - 5/5**
I’m a sucker for cheesecake. I’ve had the NY Cheesecake Cookie before. It was good but I felt like it was missing some sort of topping to put it over the edge to great. I’ve had my eyes on some other varieties (strawberry, salted caramel) but decided to give pumpkin a try. I’m meh on pumpkin but it’s seasonal, right? Well, color me surprised. The pumpkin spice flavor adds just the right extra oomph this cookie needed to be special. Glad I took a shot on it.

🍪 **Cookie Dough Cookie - 4/5**
At this point I’ll admit, this was mostly a filler cookie. I’ve seen a lot of people rave about it and it sounded alright, so I gave it a go. The brown sugar base is a nice change from the plain sugar cookies. The frosting is sweet and the little cookie dough balls are cute. It was good but nothing I’d go back for again.

🎉 **Halloween Confetti Milkshake Cookie - 4/5**
This was another filler cookie for me. I needed something to complete my mini 3 pack and it seems like one of Crumbl’s staples. I’d never had it before so I figured this would be a good time to try it. The sprinkles on the edge are cute and festive for Halloween season. The frosting is sweet and rich. The base is a basic sugar cookies. There’s a tiny dab of whipped cream for… aesthetics? Overall it’s pretty good but nothing I couldn’t get at a grocery store bakery.

How’s your graveyard week going so far?

1ohjit9,https://i.redd.it/8hk572m0ooxf1.jpeg,"How does a manual grinder like this one compare to an automatic, in your experience? [No budget]","Hi all! Long time listener, first time caller.

I’m a cafe barista with four years of experience. Two of those years were at Starbucks, and two were at a local cafe close to where I lived in Florida, and now I’m working at another local cafe after moving to the midcoast area Maine.

I normally enjoy iced drinks, iced lattes are really my preference. If I’m making it for myself, it’s a strong iced latte with extra ice. I like to add a bit of sugar in the raw, just half a teaspoon, just for a hint of sweetness. Occasionally, I’ll just pull myself a shot of espresso and drink it black, but that’s only when I don’t have a lot of time. To me, when I make coffee at home, it’s about the ritual of it. So much of the coffee I make at work is rushed, those seconds counted, that at home, I want to take my time with it, enjoy it. Let the machine heat up, clear the steam wand a bit extra, make sure my grounds are evenly distributed, the like.

As a Florida native, I didn’t like coffee until I realised it could be cold. Something about drinking hot coffee when it’s hotter than the devils armpit outside just didn’t appeal to me. Now that I live in Maine, I’m interested to see if my tastes change with the weather. I might be persuaded to try something hot. I make coffee for my Dad, and he only drinks hot drinks, normally he’s a hot latte person.

I currently have a Gaggia classic, it’s an older model, probably around 2011. I purchased it at a garage sale for $30, took it all apart, replaced the cracked boiler, and now I’m super excited to have a home espresso machine.

Now that that’s all out of the way, how does a manual grinder compare to an automatic grinder? I currently don’t have the budget for an automatic grinder (although I am saving up), so I’ve been buying pre-ground beans, although I know you’ll never get the same taste from them. I’m young, I don’t have a problem with putting in a bit of grunt work to get my coffee in the morning, but is it ridiculously hard to use a manual grinder like this? It’s (obviously) a much cheaper option. Is this a good tool to have? Can it replace an automatic grinder if I don’t mind a bit of work, or is this a piece of junk, and I should I hold out for an automatic grinder?",2,1761583448.0,espresso,7,1.0,False
1ohjim9,https://www.reddit.com/r/antiwork/comments/1ohjim9/my_five_gig_zero_sum_budget_was_nuked_by_a/,"My five gig, zero sum budget was nuked by a mandatory $4 utility tax.","The $4 Crack in the Foundation
Last week, that illusion shattered over the most trivial amount of money imaginable.

I rely on a specific, cloud-based project 
management tool to coordinate my coding sprints and tutoring schedule. It costs $38 a month. I've had that $38 budgeted down to the penny since January, knowing exactly which delivery earnings were supposed to cover it.

Then, I got the email. ""Effective immediately,"" it read, ""the Metro City Utility Tax (MCUT) has mandated a $4.00 monthly infrastructure maintenance fee on all cloud-based transaction services...""

Four dollars. You could buy one artisanal coffee with that. It's a negligible, ignorable expense for anyone with a salaried job.

For me, it was a catastrophe.

Because my budget is literally at zero, that $4 tax immediately meant I was short for the $25 commercial driver’s insurance renewal I needed for the delivery gig this week. Skip the delivery gig, and I lose $150 in anticipated revenue. Lose that $150, and I can't pay the subscription for the specialized software I use for the tutoring job. It was a total domino effect.

I spent the next two days in a full panic, cold-calling customer service lines and scrambling to sell used textbooks online just to cover that tiny $4 gap and reset the clock.

This is the struggle now. It's not about starvation yet, but it's the exhausting, relentless knowledge that we’re all operating without a safety net, one tiny bureaucratic email away from a complete financial meltdown. The system doesn't need to crush us with mountains of debt; it just needs to introduce one little, four-dollar pebble into our carefully balanced machine.

It would be awesome to add the ability to buy put/call contracts from people that have 100 of a certain item or to just be able to short certain items if you predict the price will go down.

You were kind of able to short items back when Deaths Coffer accepted new items in the game but I think they have since removed that feature. 

It would be nice to either bring it back into something like deaths coffee which isnt as significant as profiting directly in GP off the items but still gives you the ""high"" of doing a variety of trades.

For those unfamiliar with deaths coffer, a new item would come out and sell really high on the GE. The GE price wouldnt update for some time so if the price of the item falls, death would take that item at the GE value, thus being able to stack up your coffer and basically get ""free deaths"".

I (19F) don't have a single friend. I've never had any true, good friends. I had a few friend groups, but I never truly fit in. I never had a best friend, but I did have some casual friends, people who I could hang out with. I was always the weird kid so most of my friends were very weird and toxic, always talking bad about each other, so when I grew out of it, I left for my own good. It's better to be lonely than with the wrong people, I guess.

I'm extremely lucky because I have found an incredible man who's extremely intelligent, kind, hardworking and tries to help me with everything he can.
But it's not healthy to spend all of my time with him, it's not healthy to talk to him and only him. It's not healthy for him to wear himself out trying to help me get back to normalcy.

Last year I was extremely bullied and I had to leave school. This year I have a nice, kind class, but it's extremely hard for me to go after what happened last year, my mind can't comprehend that it all has passed and that I'm safe now.

So, it's been a month since I last went to class. A whole month. Each day that passes it gets more far away and more difficult to fix the situation. I just don't know what to do anymore. I spend the whole day in my bed. Literally rotting and watching the days pass, without anyone to talk to, jumping from reddit to Instagram for hours and hours. 

It's not the first time I've been in this situation, I was bullied for many years during my childhood because I was (I think the English word is) gifted (Or high-ability learner?) and very very different from the children my age. I spent three years without going to school out of fear. I spent many years in therapy and I've gotten very very far and healed a lot, but it's just not enough yet. 

I'm actually extremely outgoing and love talking to people, so I'm desperate. I don't know what to do anymore. I don't know how to many any connection, any friend, I don't know how to find anyone to talk to.

I know that everything will pass, that it's just a phase. But it's hard to endure. I have so much to talk to, so many things to say and share and I just wish I had some people to hang out and have a coffee.
