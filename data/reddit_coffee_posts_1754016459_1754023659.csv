1menbp8,https://www.reddit.com/r/AllInclusiveResorts/comments/1menbp8/ava_cancunmixed_experience/,AVA Cancun…mixed experience,"My wife and I bought paradise passes last year at Hard Rock Cancun during our honeymoon. One of the big highlights was the soon to be opening “5-diamond” resort AVA.

We used the passes this week for a family vacation and it was honestly not worth what we spent. I’ll publish the bill later and explain the cost, but it’s important to note that you can save yourself almost 1/2-1/3 of the cost by buying directly with a travel site/agent.

Food

The overall food quality was better than HardRock Cancun by a lot, however there were several challenges.

There are two buffets at either end of the resort. While they mirror each other the South Tower buffet was completely mismanaged. Food would run out constantly, the stations weren’t labeled and often the staff didn’t seem to know what their specific station was. We ended up ordering bacon from the waiter because it was literally never available. I also ordered orange juice two times and both times it came out extremely sour, as if the rinds had been ground into the juice.

The coffee bars were decent but incomplete, meant to have pastries and breakfast sandwiches but all the food areas were half empty, or worse the cooler wasn’t working.

The soft serve ice cream place was broken half the trip due to power issues, on the last day it finally was working and was decent.

All the restaurants were good, but their most popular restaurant which was “Black Iron” steakhouse was so small it was impossible to book. We did hibachi and Italian and enjoyed both, however the wine selection at the Italian place was pretty bad and bottles were insanely overpriced. Could buy several of them at American grocery stores for under $15 and were listed above $200.

Spa
The spa was clearly where they had invested the most. It was a massive space and the massages we got were great, albeit overpriced. They have something like 30+ rooms for individuals, couples and the full hydrotherapy/sauna experience looked amazing. We didn’t do anything too elaborate but a 50 minute massage was $250-$300 and a couples massage was $500+. I would have expected a better experience for that price but we used resort credits and it wasn’t bad after discounts.

Pools

There are four areas of the pool. A small family friendly pool at the north end that constantly smelled like shit because of the massive amount of seaweed (I hope) that was plaguing the area this summer. 

A kids water park and wading pool that was really nice, but was unfortunately close enough to the beach to have a mosquito problem. 

The massive main pool which is divided into sub sections. The main pool is so large they let you kayak or paddle board around and have an inflatable playground anchored in it. This section is roped off from the rest, which overall was cool. There’s also a small legend club pool slightly above the main pool, however it’s so small that the water was super warm and not very enjoyable. The main issue with the main pool is the lack of any material shade and accessibility. Along the building they have small outdoor buffets but the pool is blocked by a glass fence almost the entire length. You either have to cross one of the three bridges or find one of the small ladders to get into it, or you end up waking quite a bit. The pool hours are also limited to 9 AM- 6 PM, which during summer is kind of a bust as it’s more enjoyable in their afternoon/early evening but is already shutdown.

The last section is an adults only area. It looked nice from my balcony but I didn’t check it out as I was traveling with my two kids.

Overall experience

The resort is just not finished and should really not be fully opened yet. All over the resort there were cosmetic issues, lack of complete drywall, missing paint, poor patch jobs. Almost every thermostat on my floor had an overly large hole in the wall and exposed wiring. 

During my five day stay the resort lost power 6-8 times. The whole resort, not just sections or my room, quite literally the whole thing. We lost power while in the escape room which was a bit more entertaining but also hilariously bad.

There’s a ton of dead space or unused areas still being figured out. We watched them build what I think was a crepe or waffle shop over the week but it never opened and never had any signage.

There’s massive patio space outside along the building but no furniture, and no shade. The pool furniture is fully decked out but they have more chairs than umbrellas as well.

The Kids section was probably my son’s highlight, they did labs and had activities most of the day, as well as a large play space for kids. This was a really cool feature and free of cost.

Every other “activity” came at additional expense. Bowling, f1 simulator, escape rooms were all extra. 

In summary, if you get a good deal (under 2k) this is a decent place to visit with a lot of potential, but for what we paid and all the alleged perks of the paradise pass, it was a rip off and a disappointing experience. Between this and the underwhelming experience during our Honeymoon, I will avoid booking with RCD Hotels in the future.",1,1754023369.0,AllInclusiveResorts,0,1.0,False

its not perfect and there is a lot more I want to do, but I thrifted some paintings, got a pet-friendly plant, got curtains, put in a coffee table, and hung the vine lights in the corner. I'm thrilled with how this is turning out. I think this is definitely an improvement, it feels a lot more cozy than it did before. Unfortunately my smart bulbs aren't working so I'm stuck with this light temperature but its okay. Ignore the trash bag under the plant I forgot to buy a drip tray lol. Thank you to everyone who provided feedback, and if I didn't address your feedback today its not cause I'm ignoring it but I could only do so much.

Not like—“what’s your favorite color” knew you,
not like—“how do you take your coffee” knew you.   



I knew you.
Soul-level.
Ribcage-splitting.
Name-what-hurts-without-words kind of knowing.



I saw it—
the chaos you carry like a second skin,
the way your smile didn’t quite reach your eyes
but your eyes…
they told the whole damn story.



I saw the cracks in your armor
and didn’t flinch.
Didn’t turn away.
Didn’t try to fix.
I stayed.



I loved you.



Not the Instagram-filtered version of you,
but the mid-breakdown, mascara-streaked,
""I don't know why I sabotage everything"" version.
The you who pushed and pulled at once.
The you who was all fire and fear and
“please don’t leave—but don’t get too close.”



And God, I did.
I loved you.
So much,
it carved a home in me.



And when you hurt me—
no.
When you broke me—
when you tore through me like wildfire,
leaving only ash and echo…



I still couldn’t hate you.



Even as I sat in the ruins of myself,
breath shallow,
hope wrung dry,
heart cracked open like a cathedral roof in a storm.
I still.
Couldn’t.
Hate you.



Because I knew.
I knew where it came from.
The ghosts that taught you how to run.
The pain that made you flinch at love.
I saw it all.
And I understood.



But understanding doesn’t stop the bleeding.



And I grieve.



Oh, I grieve...



All the tomorrows we’ll never get.
The slow mornings tangled in blankets and warmth.
The inside jokes.
The forehead kisses.
The quiet. The safe. The always.



I grieve the way your hand fit mine
like it was carved from the same ache.
The way your soul sounded like home.



I grieve what we could’ve been.



But still…
I don’t regret knowing you.
Even if it wrecked me.



Because for a moment—
for a breath in time—
I touched your soul.



And it was jagged.
And it was beautiful.
And it was you.



And I loved you.



And I still do.
And that…
That has to be the end of the story.",2,1754023106.0,Original_Poetry,1,1.0,False

1men73l,https://www.reddit.com/r/scarystories/comments/1men73l/a_burnt_memory_part_1/,A Burnt Memory Part 1,"I woke up in a room I hadn’t seen in years, but it was familiar. The bed, the posters, the shelves, it all hit me at once. It was my bedroom from my junior year of high school. I stumbled out of bed, confused. My feet landed awkwardly, like I expected the floor to be closer. In a daze, I ran to the bathroom. And there I was, staring at the teenage version of myself in the mirror, the version I blamed for everything that went wrong.

I heard my mother’s voice echo through the hallway “Jonah! We need to leave for school in 25 minutes! Are you awake?”

It had been 6 years since I had heard my mother’s voice. Before she died of brain cancer, she told me she was proud of me, no matter what. I had never been a great son, any other mother would have called me a disappointment. I was constantly jobless and couldn’t hold a job for more than a few weeks. Despite her touching last words, I couldn’t make a movie-like turnaround. Knowing I didn’t live up to them destroyed me. Hearing her voice instantly brought me to tears. My face in the mirror became blurry and distorted as my eyes welled up and tears poured down my face.

I tried to reply to my mother’s call “Alr-” But I couldn’t choke out a reply, I tried again

“Alright,” I sounded hoarse and far away but I managed to squeak it out.

I splashed cold water over my face and hair to get my head back straight before getting dressed. The cold water woke me up and I cleared my head just enough to think about what was happening around me. Was I dreaming? No—I’d never had a dream this vivid. But I couldn’t be sure. Did I hit my head? Maybe, but I don’t remember being in any dangerous situation, all I remember was getting home from a job at my neighborhood deli and plopping into bed to take a nap, but that was it.

Day 1 
I need to have a recount of this situation, I have started writing entries in this journal, which I found at the convenience store next to the deli where I work. Or, will work at. Today is just the first day of this strange situation and I couldn’t find any clues or signs as to what happened to me and why I am here. Everything looked normal—like nothing had changed. But my life had been flipped backward, without warning. I went to school and had a quiz in my pre-calculus class and I easily flew through each question since I had already taken this class and more advanced classes years ago. A few teachers even complimented me on my attentiveness and how easily I grasped the concepts (that I already knew). I decided to keep a low profile and pass my classes with decent grades. Later on, when I get that set I could start doing better and getting into more advanced classes. I need to get into a good college this time around.

I ate dinner with my mother back at home after school and tried to have a normal dinner with her. Every word was forced out through gritted teeth and blurry vision. “So hun how was your day?” She asked me sincerely, “M- My day was good, h-how about yours?” I stammered, “Mine was fine, my friend told me his daughter was planning to transfer to your school. Maybe you could help her feel more comfortable at school?” I could tell she was trying to set me up or something, but mentally, I was already nearly 30 years old so the thought of being set up with a teenage girl disgusted me.

“Oh… uh. Yeah, I’ll see if she needs help,” I said quickly, avoiding eye contact. “Thank you!” she said enthusiastically. It was quiet. I said what I had to, and smiled when I needed to.

Day 3 
By now, I’d gotten good at pretending not to know too much. My teachers didn’t seem to focus on me much except for a few compliments from teachers about how I seemed to be doing better and being more attentive in class. My mother is doing good, she told me the name of her co-worker’s daughter and I recognized the name, I remember her being a new student during my junior year, she was pretty quiet but she had a few friends from art classes as far as I know.

Day 6 
I think something changed. From what I remember, every day had been a normal school day, I found the girl my mom suggested, and she seemed like she had already met a few people so I didn’t worry much about it. During a class, I don’t even remember what class it was, or what class was after or before, but as I was filling in blank lines on paper, I could hear my teacher’s voice but didn’t hear anything she was saying, I heard the muffled speech coming from speakers next door, I could hear pencils around me scratching on paper, then I couldn’t.

Everything around me disappeared, or I couldn’t see anything, just me and my desk. I’m not sure how to explain it but I felt extreme pressure, I looked up and I couldn’t see anything past the end of my desk, and I couldn’t move. A moment later, I blinked and everything was back around me. I might have fallen asleep and dreamt it, I can’t be sure but it didn’t feel like any dream I had ever had.

Day 10 
I remember people that existed when I was in high school that don’t exist here. I remember a student who was on the basketball team named Eric Mitchell who I can’t find anywhere. The spelling of the name of my school is wrong, it should be Maplewood High School. I know it used to be Maplewood because I had a poster in my room that screamed “MAPLEWOOD HIGH” in bold red letters from when our school won the basketball regional championship. But now the posters plastered everywhere around the halls read Mapelwood High School. A student Eric Mitchell was voted MVP of the basketball team the year they won the regional championship, but no one even knows his name. I’ve asked around and nothing. A few teachers might also be different but I can’t remember.

Day 20 
This morning I came downstairs, and the stairs creaked under my feet, louder than usual, too loud. Has it always been so loud? My hands wouldn’t stop shaking. I kept reaching for the walls, I needed to hold onto something. Mom was there in the kitchen, leaning on the counter. She had her phone in one hand, coffee steam floating next to her.

“Hun, your tie is messed up,” she said, waving her hand toward my chest. Her voice was calm, warm—so motherly, like nothing had ever changed. Like she hadn’t been gone for years, it almost knocked the air out of me. I tried to adjust my tie, but my hands fumbled and my fingers numb.

“Here let me help you” she quickly says as she grabs the knot on my tie and tightens it to my collar. “Better?” she asked, tilting her head with her soft smile. “Yeah, thanks,” I mumbled, but the words didn’t sound right. Too sharp, too flat, and it didn’t sound like my voice. I swallowed hard, my smile still stretched on my face.

She turned back to the counter, reaching for her coffee. I sat down at the kitchen table, trying to stop my hands from trembling. Then I heard it—soft, almost a whisper. She was humming. I froze. The melody curled through the air like steam from her cup. I hadn’t heard it in over a decade, but I knew every note. It was the lullaby she used to sing when I couldn’t sleep. When I was little and scared of thunderstorms or nightmares or just being alive.

“Sleep, my star, the sky is near, The night won’t stay, I’ll keep you here…” Her voice was quiet, not even singing really—just breathing the song like it had never left her. Or maybe it never had. I couldn’t breathe. My chest tightened, and my eyes burned again. The tears came before I could stop them.

“You still remember that?” I whispered. She glanced over her shoulder with a soft smile. “Of course,” she said. “You always quieted down when I sang it. Like magic.” She chuckled gently. “Still works, huh?”

I nodded, swallowing the lump in my throat. I wanted to tell her everything. That I’d failed. That she died. That I missed her so much it broke me. But all I could do was sit there, listening like a child again—safe, for just a moment.

I slid out the front door shortly after and drove myself to school. I don’t remember the drive, I just remember walking through the main doors and seeing the secretary wave at me but I couldn’t react. I just kept walking, head down.

I got myself through the day somehow, but the walls were screaming at me. The bright posters, all those colors, and letters kept pulling at my eyes, daring me to look closer. “Mapelwood High School.” Wrong. It was wrong. It mocked me like they knew what I remembered.

I got in my car and I started driving on pure instinct, I drove to the hospital near my house, the one my mother lay in, dying.

“H-Hi good afternoon, can I see a Ms. Carol Vance?” I asked the receptionist, tears pulling at the corners of my eyes.

She directed me to a different part of the building, to room 56. Room 56, the room I watched her take her last breath, the same room she told me she would be back home in no time. I pushed through the door, seeing her dark eyes and pale face sunken into the memory foam pillow underneath her head. The scent of antiseptic and faint lavender, her favorite lotion, drifted into the air as if seeping through the walls. I rested my hand on her shoulder to wake her without startling her. Her eyes fluttered open in slow motion as her eyes scanned the room, eventually landing on my face. I exhaled a breath I hadn’t known I was holding.

“H-Hi mom, how a-are you f-feeling?” I whispered “Jonah? Jonah is that you?” she asked me grabbing my hand, “Yes m-mom, it’s me” I assured her with a weight sinking in my heart, “Hi son” she exhaled, “M-Mom are you alright?” I stammered, placing my other hand over her hand which was grabbing onto mine firmly “Haha, yes hun I am alright, how are you?” “W-Well, I’m not exactly sure. There's a lot on my mind, I’m just not sure what” My eyes found the floor in front of my shoes, avoiding her gaze. “Well, I always say, you’ve survived one hundred percent of the things you’ve been through, so what is one more?”

I sighed through a smile, I looked up and met her gaze, she was smiling, cheeks twitching. “Yeah, you’re right” I nodded my head and my eyes found the floor once again, a long pause between us.

“Well, I better head home to help my mom with din-” I froze. My eyes widened in fear and confusion. Help my mom with dinner? But my mom is right here in front of me! I snapped my head up to look at her, panic filling my chest but my eyes saw my hands chopping vegetables on a cutting board. I wasn’t in the hospital anymore. I was back at home. But how? The knife slipped from my grasp, clattering against the cutting board. My hands froze, trembling over the counter. I lost control of my legs and fell strumbled back. I slammed against the counter, breath jolted from my lungs. I bounced off the counter and fell forward. The last thing I saw was the corner of the counter in front of me, getting closer, fast.

Day 21? 
I woke up in a bed with this notebook next to me, I don’t know whose notebook this is. The handwriting looks identical to mine near the beginning, but I don’t remember writing any of this, let alone any of it happening to me. But towards the end, the handwriting gets increasingly frantic over time and becomes scribbles and scratches at the very end. I decided to write in this assuming it’s mine. I can’t remember who I am, but based on this notebook my name is Jonah and my mother is Carol. I don’t know if I am a high school student or an adult. Is my mom dead? Is she alive?

End entries

After finishing the sentence, I dropped the pen and ran to the bathroom after my situation sunk in. Who am I? I splashed water on my face and into my eyes, brisk water filled my eyes as my hands directed themselves towards a towel somewhere to the right of me, I don’t know how I knew that was there but I used it to dry off my eyes. I cleared my eyes of water and looked at the mirror. I saw a person, but the more I looked, the less sense it made, I saw a man, but I kept staring and realized it was a boy, I blinked and it was still a man. It felt like my eyes couldn’t focus but I saw the face clearly, it just didn’t make any sense.

I brought my face closer to the mirror. I was about 6 inches away from the mirror at that point. Inches, I measure in inches. Am I American? At the same time, I saw stubble and smooth skin on “my” jaw. Is it my face?

I can’t feel my hands, they’re tingling, I’ve lost control of them, I can’t keep them still. My heart is pounding too hard, too fast, like it’s about to burst out of my chest. Every breath feels wrong like it’s too shallow, it’ll never be enough. I’m drowning. The eerie silence was filled with my ears humming, I could almost think of something, why can’t I think of anything? My thoughts were right there, but they were behind a wall, a thick, stone wall.

My hands grasped the cold stone, I felt it crumble under my hand, small pieces shattering and bouncing off my arm. I lifted my left foot onto a protruding rock below me, it shifted under my weight. Again I stretched my arm to pull myself higher, I lifted my leg to push my body to the next stone, I could see the top, and with every step I took, it got no closer. COME ON! CLIMB! My foot slipped out of the foothold I had, my hand shot out to grab onto something, anything. My fingers grasped around a jagged edge, but it came loose. I fell back. The top of the wall shrunk, and I kept falling, where’s the ground?! I fell for minutes, but the top of the wall faded into a grey, jagged horizon.

I was coughing up sand, tasting salt and grit. My hands were raw, covered in grains. I stumbled forward, the sand burning underfoot, and the horizon flickered. I scrambled to get up off the sand and onto my feet, where am I now? If I am facing water, there must be more land behind me! I turned to escape this arid beach, behind me was… another beach? I took a step forward, but as I picked up my foot, my other sank into the sand, as if the sand was a liquid. God, why? I fell forward with my foot stuck beneath the sand's surface and landed on my hands, they also passed straight through the top of the sand. I heard the hissing of sand around me, I picked up my head just in time to see walls of sand rising, swallowing me whole. I glimpsed the sun dipping out of view behind the sand consuming me. Sand compacted around my body scarring my skin, it filled my throat and tore my eyes, each grain scraping until there was nothing but darkness left. I choked on the coarse grains. They wooshed as they pushed into my ears, ripping my eardrums, replacing wooshing with a deafening, endless ringing.

Left with none of my five senses, I plunged into pure darkness. The feeling of sand scuffing my skin faded, and the ringing in my ears echoed around me. It felt like drifting through space—not the space you see in photos attached to articles taken with telescopes orbiting Earth, but the chilling, cold, and empty void space really is. The vast emptiness stretched endlessly, a silent, crushing void where no warmth or light could reach. An icy numbness seeped into every part of me, it stripped away any trace of life and warmth I’d ever known.

“Mom…” My words shaped themselves, whispering past my lips.

But who is she? My heart throbbed inside my chest, arms and legs twitching with each pulse. I strained to understand my body's connection to this word, a frayed thread hanging in the void of my head.

At [**Dr. Phil DDS**](https://www.drphildds.com/teeth-whitening/) in Plainview, that dream becomes reality. Their professional whitening treatment combines clinical precision with lasting results to lift stains and boost confidence effortlessly.

https://preview.redd.it/e9i0m7x36cgf1.png?width=1615&format=png&auto=webp&s=65951f41b2ccb96811e5823315b3889e2756c946

**Why Choose a Professional Whitening Treatment?**

Over‑the‑counter kits might promise quick results, but they rarely match the safety, effectiveness, or long‑term benefits of dentist-supervised whitening. Dr. Phil's multi-stage approach offers:

* Controlled, personalized treatment plans
* Longer-lasting brightness without risk of overtreating
* Expert supervision for sensitive teeth and gum protection

**Dr. Phil's Proven Three-Stage Whitening Process**

Their signature teeth whitening program blends in-office precision with personalized at-home care—delivered in three well‑structured phases:

1. **In-Office Power Bleaching** Conducted in two sessions, this uses high-grade whitening agents under controlled conditions to remove surface and deep-set discoloration efficiently.
2. **Custom-Fitted Home Trays** Dr. Phil provides personalized trays and bleaching gel for night‑time use over a couple of weeks—perfect for gradually brightening and maintaining results.
3. **Support and Maintenance** With guidance throughout the process, patients get advice on foods, habits, and follow-up care to ensure they keep their best smile for the long haul.

**Who Benefits Most from This Treatment?**

Dr. Phil's whitening service isn't one-size-fits-all—it works especially well for:

* People with coffee, tea, wine, or tobacco stains
* Those with safe enamel and minimal sensitivity
* Individuals looking to maintain a brighter smile after cosmetic treatments like veneers or bonding
* Anyone needing quick, noticeable results under professional oversight

**What to Expect During Your Whitening Journey**

When you book a teeth whitening treatment with Dr. Phil DDS, here's how your experience unfolds:

* **Initial Consultation**: An assessment of dental health, stain type, and suitability for whitening
* **Planning Session**: Creation of custom trays and review of at-home protocol
* **First Whitening Session**: In-clinic application to lift major discolorations
* **Second Office Visit**: Follow‑up whitening to perfect results
* **At‑Home Treatment**: Gentle nightly bleaching to fine‑tune brightness
* **Advice & Follow‑Up**: Tips on how to protect your results and schedule any touch-ups

**Why Dr. Phil DDS Stands Out in Plainview**

Plainview's residents have trusted [**Dr. Phil DDS**](https://www.drphildds.com/discover-your-best-smile-with-dr-phil-ddss-teeth-whitening-procedure-in-plainview/) not only for whitening but for a full suite of cosmetic and restorative dental services—from veneers and implants to one-visit crowns. Welcoming patients across Nassau County, Dr. Phil's practice uses modern tech like digital x‑rays, CAD-CAM scanning, and laser tools for safe and efficient care.

**Aftercare Advice to Keep Your Smile Shining**

The work isn't done when the whitening treatment ends. Dr. Phil's team recommends:

* Avoiding staining foods and drinks (coffee, berries, red wine) for the first few days
* Using touch‑up trays periodically—typically every few months
* Practicing fluoride treatments or whitening polishing during routine cleanings to fight future staining

**Real Results That Make an Impression**

Although Dr. Phil hasn't publicly published exact statistical outcomes, many patients leave reviews praising noticeably brighter teeth and enhanced overall appearance—whether for special events or long-term confidence boosts.

**Is Professional Whitening Right for You?**

If you're ready to go beyond store-bought kits and invest in visibly brighter results—safely and predictably—Dr. Phil DDS's teeth whitening is a smart choice. Their clinical-grade treatment, personalized care, and modern facilities help Plainview residents get the smile they've always wanted.

**What Our Patients Are Saying**

*""I tried every whitening strip and toothpaste out there—nothing worked like Dr. Phil's professional treatment. I noticed a huge difference after just one session!""*  
— *Megan L., Plainview*

*""The custom trays and support were amazing. My smile looks better than it did on my wedding day. I'll be recommending Dr. Phil to all my friends!""*  
— *Jason T., Bethpage*

*""Not only was the whitening fast, but the team made me feel comfortable from the start. No sensitivity at all, and I love the results!""*  
— *Carla R., Hicksville*

**FAQs**

1. **Is teeth whitening safe for everyone?** While teeth whitening is safe for most individuals, it's essential to consult with Dr. Phil DDS to determine if it's suitable for you, especially if you have existing dental conditions.
2. **How long do the results last?** With proper care, teeth whitening results can last up to two years. Avoiding staining foods and maintaining good oral hygiene can prolong the effects.
3. **Will teeth whitening make my teeth sensitive?** Some patients may experience temporary sensitivity after whitening treatments, but this typically subsides within a few days.
4. **Can over-the-counter products achieve the same results?** Over-the-counter products may offer minimal improvements. Professional treatments at Dr. Phil DDS provide more significant and longer-lasting results.
5. **How often can I whiten my teeth?** It's advisable to wait at least six months between professional whitening sessions. Dr. Phil DDS can provide personalized recommendations based on your needs. 

**Next Step: Book Your Consultation**

Consider a consultation to assess whether whitening treatment suits your dental health and aesthetic goals. With treatment starting quickly—from custom trays to in-office sessions—you could be smiling brighter within weeks.

She looked confused in the starting when I was walking more than the usual. 

The usual was the bare minimum my hungover dehydrated self could do. 

I make my self a Moka pot coffee and read 15-20 pages of a book. Reading which got somewhere lost in the past. 

Do not have to force myself to exercise. Even the less active days are more active then when I was hungover. 

No more blabbering conversations in the night with people repeating topics and forgetting them. 

Life is good being sober. Relearning how to enjoy and appreciate life. 

I have slipped twice in the last 50-60 days. But that slip was only 01 day. I need to get myself to be completely sober, no more traps of moderation or allowances. Being sober is the number one priority.

Thats also not an abnormal thing I have two main teachers that just prefer their first name. So Mr.J teacher my absolute favorite class and a subject I want a career in, so I got very attached to him as a teacher because of that too. However I also just, on the first day of class was already drawn to him for whatever reason, I think he's a very interesting person. So I kept working with him for class and whatnot then the second year I had him, my mother died, and he saw and helped me through pretty well every breakdown I had, and I always felt bad for dragging him into my problems, but he was very nice about it always. Then he had to tell his classes, that he'd been diagnosed with cancer, which another teacher told him it'd be best to tell me one on one because my mother. Which was again really kind, so he kind of became my emotional support person, the first person Id go to when I felt like I was going to cry. Im still kind of guilty about doing that. But anyway we do theater and I was a designer and since he was our instructor for that and he would be there often he gave me and my friend/co-designer his number so we could ask questions if he wasn't there, but I somehow ended up pitching the idea of sending him animal photos while he got infusions so for every other week for months I would just spend an hour sending him pet photos and he'd occasionally ask me things and I really just feel like we've become friends, but I know, I know it's strange, but never ever once has he made me uncomfortable for give me any sort of weird feeling. I trust him more then anyone and I genuinely see him more then I see my actual father (who I dont have a terrible relationship with, but hes just difficult, cause alcohol) and he already would take classes out to get ice cream sometimes cause we jave a very small class and so do some of my other teachers, and I had a different teacher buy me dinner once, so its not that strange to get food from my teachers and since I was a teacher assistant in the morning we'd frequently go get coffee since it was in walking distance and I just yap to him all the time. He also invited me and a friend (almost all of what I say goes for one of my friends too because we're always together) to work a professional theater show and Im just really stressed. Idk idk why Im writing this I dont expect a single person to read all of this, idk even know if it makes any sense. Im just curious if I might make my teacher uncomfortable, cause I often feel very pushy and like I'm prying and Im worried I'll get him in trouble.",1,1754022633.0,Teachers,3,1.0,False
1men398,https://i.redd.it/dckfwkco5cgf1.jpeg,New purchases,"Quick reviews for a couple of recent purchases ( mainly in the interest of alternative content to clones 😉) 

Eight & Bob - Nuit de Mègeve

This is Vetiver forward ( Vetiver is probably my favourite note ) but also has a bit of interest with some Coffee and Tonka. Not overly keen on most Coffee frags I’ve tried but this one is firmly in the background so it’s not too sharp or cloying. The Tonka gives a tiny bit of sweetness but it’s the Vetiver that comes through most of all. 
Happy with this purchase, went for the 30ml as it’s more than enough. 
I wish more brands did 15 or 30ml bottles as I rarely get through 100ml of anything.


Santa Maria Novella - Tabacco Toscano 

A lovely light Tobacco, easy to wear and a true unisex. Vanilla and Musk give it a bit of sweetness/ creaminess, almost goes lactonic to me but thankfully doesn’t get there  as I can’t abide milky notes. 
The Tobacco isn’t too strong so this is easy to wear anytime of the year. This would be a great one for anyone looking to get into Tobacco scents .

1men0l1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MeetNewPeopleHere/comments/1men0l1/32m_vancouver_married_man_looking_to_chat/,[32/M] Vancouver- married man looking to chat,"Hi,

I’m a 32-year-old married Indian man from Vancouver, Canada. Life's been busy lately, and I'm looking to relax and unwind with some good conversation. I’m hoping to connect with a like-minded lady who’s up for a chat. I'm open to all kinds of conversations—whether you just want someone to listen, enjoy a platonic exchange, or you're feeling a little adventurous, I’m here for it.

About me: I’m known to be fun, especially if you’re the calm and fun type too. I’m well-educated, soft-spoken, and generally considered a nice guy. Not tall, but fit—I run a lot. I’d say I’m fairly good-looking and happy to share a photo. I enjoy reading, watching YouTube, and being outdoors—hiking and weekend walks are my thing.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **ATP Toronto Showdown: Fabian Marozsan vs. Flavio Cobolli – A Tale of Two Form Curves**

Ladies and gentlemen, grab your rackets and your popcorn, because we’re about to witness a tennis match that’s less *Wimbledon* and more *The IT Crowd*. On one side, we have **Flavio Cobolli**, the Italian “I-Talian” (get it? *flavio*… *flavor*? Never mind, I’ll sit here in silence), who’s won four of his last five matches but looked like a man trying to solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded in his opener against Galarneau. On the other, **Fabian Marozsan**, the Hungarian “Maro-zen Master,” who’s won three of his last five but has the kind of focus that makes a laser pointer look lazy.

### Parsing the Odds: A Numbers Game

Let’s start with the cold, hard stats. Cobolli’s 80% win rate (4-1) sounds impressive until you realize three of those wins came against players named “Nobody Special” and “Also Nobody.” His lone loss? A three-set thriller against Galarneau that probably gave the crowd a case of tennis elbow from all the nail-biting. Meanwhile, Marozsan’s 60% win rate (3-2) includes two matches where he played like a man possessed—think of him as the tennis version of a Roomba on a coffee high: relentless, efficient, and not to be trifled with.

The odds tell a similar story. Cobolli is the slight favorite at decimal odds of **1.8** (55.5% implied probability), while Marozsan hovers around **2.0** (50%). But here’s the kicker: when you factor in Marozsan’s dominance in their head-to-head (he’s 2-0 against Cobolli, per the article—wait, no, the article says Cobolli beat Galarneau, and Marozsan beat Auger-Aliassime. *Wait, what?* Let me check that again… Oh, right! The user’s note says Marozsan “dominated in both matches,” which we’ll assume refers to his recent wins. Either way, the math checks out: Marozsan is a value bet here.

### News Digest: Injuries, Exhaustion, and Emotional Baggage

Cobolli’s recent “struggle” against Galarneau isn’t just a stat—it’s a narrative. Imagine being so focused on your backhand that you forget to breathe.

I get super sick if I have more than like 70 mg, so I usually don’t order coffee. But every once in a while when I’m with coffee drinkers, I’ll order a decaf coffee. I’ll usually double check when they hand it off to make sure I won’t get sick. Today I ordered a decaf and as she went to do the espresso, she said oh shoot, decaf on the whatever you ordered, right? I said yes, but my boyfriend got caught off guard by her reading the wrong drink back and corrected her. I didn’t think I needed to verify it was decaf considering she asked me while she was actively making it. Then cue 6 hours of straight hell. I get that mistakes happen, but it’s 70% of the time. I lost half my day because someone couldn’t take 2 seconds to verify the order before handing it off to me. I did not have that time to spare, and I don’t have an intricate order, it’s just as is. On top of that, my “male” spider I didn’t want laid EGGS I don’t know how to take care of and our spider trap caught a friggin mouse while I was trying to figure out the spider issue.

Hey, AiContentAutomators fam! 🙌 Are we all stuck in this never-ending cycle of swiping through doomscrolling news? It's wild out there! As if the world isn’t chaotic enough, how about we swap that mindless scrolling with something that actually adds to our wallets? You know, stackin’ cash instead of scrolling through chaos.

**Let’s chat about some AI monetization methods** that are making waves this week, because why not turn those scrolling hours into money-making hours? 

Here’s what I've stumbled upon:

1. **AI-Driven Content Creation:**
   - Ever tried selling AI-generated articles or social media posts? With sites like Fiverr and Upwork, you can put your new skills to work. Using some AI tools, you can crank out quality content while enjoying your favorite snacks. 🍕 Who said work had to be boring?

2. **Automated Online Courses:**
   - You’re sitting on a gold mine of knowledge! Build an online course using AI tools that help create engaging content. Platforms like Teachable or Udemy are ripe for picking. Plus, you can scale your income while sipping some iced coffee from your couch! ☕️💻

3. **Affiliate Marketing with AI Tweaks:**
   - Let AI do the heavy lifting by analyzing trends and finding the hottest products to promote. Combining authentic recommendations with AI insights means you won't be advertising your aunt's weird online knitting class unless it’s trending. 😂 Win-win!

4. **Chatbots for Service Businesses:**
   - Think of small businesses that don't have a customer service department. Offer to set up AI chatbots for them! It’s a game-changer for responsiveness, and guess who gets paid for their brilliant idea? Yep, that’s you!

5. **Niche Content Curation:**
   - Use AI tools to create curated newsletters or blogs in niche markets. Think of all those random YouTube channels turning a profit just by highlighting the quirky stuff! You can be known as the go-to of... wait for it... *mystery box unboxings* or *weird food combos*! 

So the next time you catch yourself scrolling, remember that those hours can be transformed into productive chunks of time for building your empire. Why doomscroll when you can *do*—and stack that cash instead?

And hey, I get it—making that first move can be daunting! Sometimes it feels like diving into an ice-cold pool, right? 🥶 But once you're in, you realize it’s not so bad—just a little refreshing! Who’s with me on that?

Let’s brainstorm these ideas! Have any of you implemented any of these methods this week? I’m super curious to hear your success stories or challenges—let’s conquer this together!",1,1754021779.0,AIContentAutomators,0,1.0,False
1memue1,https://www.reddit.com/r/dustythunder/comments/1memue1/my_mom_had_a_secret_relationship_with_my/,My mom had a secret relationship with my boyfriends dad...,"Buckle up because this is a long one



In January of 2024 I (21F) came home to my parents house after work. When I walked in, my mom (54F) was sitting in the kitchen excited and called me over to talk with her. She told me that she made friends with the guy who worked on her car (we’ll call him Bob) and that they got to talking about their kids. Bob told my mom about his son who is kind, sweet, and overall just a great guy. He showed her pictures and she said he was super cute and tall and that I would like him. They showed him a photo of me and he called me cute too! So obviously I wanted to see what he looked like but she didn’t have a photo. All she knew was where he worked and that he was a sweet kid who had his life together. Finally a guy who has his own house, car, and job… honestly it was refreshing lol. After hearing all of that I started getting really excited too and wanted to meet him.



So I said screw it and after drinking two cups of coffee that day I had some major caffeinated confidence that I never had before and decided to go meet him. Long story short I showed up at his job, introduced myself, and asked him if he wanted to take me out on a date. He said yes and we started planning. For the remainder of this post we’ll call him Adam (27m). Adam and I got along really well and started dating (still dating as of today 2025!). The day after our first date he gave me a key to his place and I was moved in by week 2. I know, I know, it was very fast but we had a connection like no other. Neither of us had ever felt this way before and it was genuinely like love at first sight. I always thought they exaggerated it in the movies but it felt so real experiencing it myself. We’ve had our ups and down but he truly still feels like the one.



Fast forward to April 2024, Adam and I were on a date at a cuter little ramen joint. There were two couples sitting next to us getting really drunk and of course Adam and I started lowkey listening to the conversation as one does… Anyway, after hearing a few key words, I whispered to Adam “How much you wanna bet they’re swingers?” He chuckled and I leaned in again and asked “Can I tell you something?” He looked intrigued and said yes. I told him that I’ve never told anyone this before and that he can’t tell anyone but I wanted to talk about it. I told him that I found out last year that my parents are swingers/in an open relationship. Then I was about to go on to tell him how I found out and vent a little, but then I looked up at his face and stopped. He put his hand to his forehead and sighed in what I couldn’t tell was relief or pain. I quickly said “oh don’t worry! I made sure to ask my mom if she met your dad in that community and she assured me that they didn’t so you don't have to worry about that!”



He looked at me with the saddest, most worried facial expression and told me he had something to tell me too. He said that he met my mom last year, a month before he met me because she was coming over to sleep with his dad. That they had been in a sexual relationship since then and still are. They told him before we went out on our first date to lie to me and tell me that they met each other when Bob fixed my moms car. They continued to tell him this in the 3 months we were dating at the time. That if he told me the truth, I would break up with him immediately. For context, I told my mom when I found out about her and my dads relationship that I didn’t want it to bleed over into my personal life. Basically I didn’t care what they did in their relationship as long as it didn’t affect me. So throughout our short relationship at the time, he was constantly conflicted. He said that he hated keeping it from me and that he only did it because he was scared that I would leave him but that now it was brought up, he had to tell me no matter what. He said one of the main reasons he didn’t before this was also because of the way I talked about my parents. I always praised them and their relationship, they're good parents and I love them, so he was under the assumption that I didn’t know they were open. He was afraid of crushing my image of them and not only me leaving him, but ruining my relationship with them. 



I was PISSED… to say the least. She PROMISED me that they didn’t sleep together and that they were just friends. Not only that but Adam told me she would come over while I was working the night shift and sneak out before I came home. They had loud kinky sex in Adam's house (Bob was staying with him) while Adam was there. They did this at least once a week and pretty much rubbed it in his face. Why didn't he tell them to stop, you may ask? He says he just wanted to stay out of it and most of the time they were mid doin it when he got home… not much he could do there. On top of that, he was scared to have sex with me at first because he was afraid I would sound like my mom… gross. Thankful he says I do not lol



We left the restaurant so I could calm down and register everything he had just told me. He tried to take my phone away from me so I wouldn’t say anything I would regret to my mom buttt he was unsuccessful. I called my mom on the hour-long drive home and cursed her out for lying to me, making my boyfriend lie to me/threatening him by saying I would break up with him, and for sneaking around/shoving their sex in his face. She was NOT apologetic at all and pretty much said that she was their first, she's the adult, and she can do whatever she wants.



 After we calmed down she said that, and I quote,

 “If I had been honest, it might have shut the door of opportunity for you and Adam to have what you have now. I felt horrible about putting Adam in that position and I knew that if you guys got really close it would come out because I wouldn’t have been able to hold it in either. I’ve thought about it many times and I couldn’t tell you because first I know you don’t want to know about this stuff and second, it’s complicated grown up shit and honestly some of it is embarrassing.”



I forgave her after we talked in person but told her to stop having sex with him. She promised me she would stop, we hugged it out, and moved on. 



For a year everything was fine until Adam and I were laying in bed and he got a text from his dad. It was a long paragraph about how horrible my mother is, that she's a drug addict, abusive, etc. and that he needed to break up with me so that he (Bob) doesn’t have to deal with her anymore. We were VERY confused but he would not elaborate. Just that they were at Bob's house and something went down. 



I went to see my mom the next day and long story short they were sleeping together again and got into a fight over us. Of course there was a screaming match between us and I told her she broke my trust. I can’t trust her anymore because she broke a promise and pushed a bounty too far. It’s not too much to ask for your mom not to have sex with your boyfriend's dad, right? Well apparently to her it was. 



Although I was really mad at the time, I was also glad that this happened. This meant that they wouldn’t talk to each other anymore and I wouldn’t have to worry. Since then my mom blocked Bob on everything (even though he has reached out and has asked about her more than once lol). 



Now my mom and I get along, though we’re still in the process of building that trust again, and Bob and I get along really well too. He told me today that he's glad his son is dating me and sees just how happy it made him. That every time he comes over, the house is filled with laughter and joy and he considers me part of the family. 



So there's a happy ending to all this drama! Adam and I have gotten even closer and plan to move states soon and buy a home. He’s supported me through all of this and much more and has been the best partner I could’ve asked for. 



I hope you guys enjoyed my story and I’ll answer any questions you have! Honestly I left out a lot but I’m writing this on a doc and am on page 5 so I figured I’d end it here lol

Chapter1
The moment the SATs were over, I slept with Chase Walker for the first time.

In the heat of it all, I gasped out loud—only to hear him whisper a name that wasn’t mine.

“Maddie…”

But my name is Sierra. Maddie is my twin sister.

I blinked, stunned, and looked up at him. “Who did you just say?”

Chase kept moving, lowering his head to kiss my eyelids. “Sierra,” he murmured, his voice thick, “don’t get distracted. You’re enjoying this, right?”

His rhythm quickened, driving away every ounce of doubt I had left.

Chase was a jock—strong, tireless, and always creative. My body trembled uncontrollably beneath him. I tried to push him away. “Don’t…”

He leaned into my ear, voice hoarse with desire. “Baby, let’s try it on top this time.”

That night, he wore me down—again and again—until I was crying, begging, shaking, and still he didn’t stop.

Not until sunrise did he finally stumble into the bathroom, satisfied.

I lay there, too sore to move, my limbs aching like they didn’t belong to me.

Then his phone on the nightstand started blowing up with notification pings.

Instinctively, I glanced at the screen—and froze.

[Congrats, Walker! You finally got some last night!]

My heart dropped. I couldn’t stop myself. I unlocked his phone and opened the group chat.

What I saw made my entire body go numb.

He’d sent a photo of the bloodstained hotel bedsheet. In the middle of the night.

The messages came in a flood:

[Holy crap, Chase—you really did it with Sierra? I thought you were into Maddie?]

[C’mon, they’re twins. Same face, same body. He’s just warming up with Sierra before he goes all in with Maddie. Practice makes perfect, right?]

[Exactly. He’s in love with Maddie. Sierra’s just a stand-in so he doesn’t screw it up with the real thing.]

Every word felt like a slap.

I’d spent hours wondering why Chase liked me. I’d imagined a thousand reasons—none of them this.

Chase wasn’t just a jock. He was the school's golden boy, surrounded by friends and admiration.

I was the quiet one. The bookworm everyone ignored.

We shouldn’t have had anything in common. But one day back in junior year, during gym, I’d accidentally bled through my pants from my period.

Chase had taken off his team jacket and wrapped it around my waist.

Since then, he’d left breakfast on my desk every morning. Tucked handwritten notes in my school loker.

I’d fallen—hard. But I never understood why someone like him would choose someone like me.

So one day I asked, “What do you like about me?”

He smiled and said, “Because you’re you.”

That first love, the kind you believe will last forever—I’d given it my all.

I thought losing my virginity to him meant something.

Turns out, it was just a performance. A carefully orchestrated “first time,” for his benefit.

I clenched my fists so tightly my knuckles turned white, my palms streaked with red. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

The water stopped running. I rushed to put his phone back and pretend nothing happened.

The door opened. Chase walked out, dripping water, a towel slung low on his hips. His tanned skin glistened with drops, muscles sculpted and bare.

“You’re up. Hungry?”

He came to the bed, voice gentle, eyes dark with something I couldn’t name. He glanced down at the bruises on my collarbone.

I couldn’t answer. All I could hear was the echo of his voice last night—calling me Maddie.

“I’m not hungry.”

He saw the redness at the corners of my eyes and immediately pulled me into his arms. “Did I hurt you? I didn’t mean to—I just… I was new to this. I’ll get better. We can keep practicing.”

His hand slid under my shirt again.

I flinched away. “Don’t. I’m sore.”

He paused, then slowly smoothed down my wrinkled collar, his voice soft with guilt. “I lost control last night. Have some rest, I’ll go downstairs and grab you breakfast.”

He got dressed and left.

I stared at the blood on the white sheets and felt my entire body go hollow.

For two years, we’d been secretly dating. I’d hidden everything from my teachers, from my friends. I did everything he asked, said yes to everything.

He wanted Columbia, so I made it my dream too.

He held my hand under the desk during class; I blushed and kept reciting vocab.

He asked to meet me behind the field after study hall; I gave him my first kiss.

Now the exams were over, he wanted a symbolic “rite of passage,” and I gave him everything.

I thought it was love.

But it was just rehearsal.

If Maddie was who he loved from the beginning, then I didn’t want to love him anymore. I didn’t want to be the stand-in.

I got dressed and left the hotel.

At a pharmacy down the street, I awkwardly asked the clerk for emergency contraceptive pills.

She eyed me up and down, frowning, and pulled a box from the shelf. “You should’ve had your boyfriend use protection. These are awful for your body, you know.”

My face burned. I could barely speak.

There were condoms in the drawer beside the bed. I’d told Chase to grab a box.

But he’d just moaned in my ear, red-eyed and desperate.

“Sierra… it feels weird with that stuff on. Please, just this once. I swear I won’t go too far.”

I gave in.

And now here I was, buying back my freedom one pill at a time.

“Thanks,” I told the clerk as I paid. “Just this once.”

Never again.

Never again would I believe anything Chase Walker said.

Chapter2
I had barely stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard whispers behind me.

“Just like a hooker.”

“She looked so sweet… But...Unbelievable.”

Their words lashed across my face like a whip, burning hot from my cheeks all the way to my chest.

I hurried away, clutching the paper bag, my vision blurring. At the bus stop, I washed down the white pill with a bottle of water.

I drank too fast. The water caught in my throat, and I started coughing so hard my eyes watered.

“Sierra!”

Chase came running up, out of breath, worry etched into every feature.

“Why’d you leave the hotel without telling me? I texted, I called. Where have you been?”

The way he said it—like I was the one being cruel—it almost made me laugh.

Almost.

But all I felt was this sharp, twisting ache in my chest.

“I went to buy emergency contraception,” I said, holding up the now-empty pill box.

His expression faltered. Embarrassment crept into his eyes.

“You could’ve told me. Or let me go get it. I was worried.”

I didn’t want to argue over this. “It won’t happen again.”

He sensed something was off. He reached for my hand. “I’m sorry I lost control last night. I’ll be more careful next time.”

Then he smiled. “Hey, the Class President is throwing a graduation party at Capital Square. Come with me?”

I pulled my hand back. “No one knows we’re together. It’s better if we go separately.”

Chase stiffened. After a moment, he nodded.

“Okay. I’ll grab a cab.”

I didn’t reply. I just got on the next bus.

He had promised we’d go public after the SATs.

But for the past few days, while he chatted away in the group chat, not once had he mentioned me.

And I’d already seen the truth in that secret text thread with his friends.

There was no relationship to announce.

By the time I got to the private dining room at Capital Square, the place was packed.

Maddie, dressed in a pink Lolita-style dress, sat surrounded like some Disney princess. Chase was right next to her, peeling cherries and handing them to her one by one.

A few classmates started teasing, “Chase, you’ve been so good to the Prom Queen all year. You better shoot your shot before college. Once you get to Columbia, there’ll be too many options!”

Everyone had seen how good Chase was to Maddie.

Even though he was secretly dating me, publicly, he was always by Maddie’s side—helping her clean up after class, saving her a spot in the lunch line, carrying her books.

He was even the one who rallied the guys to vote her Prom Queen.

But we were twins. We looked almost identical.

Back then, he’d explained, “Maddie’s got a weaker constitution. People tend to bully her. You’re stronger, Sierra. You have me.”

I actually believed it. I believed he loved me so much, he was kind to my sister too.

Looking back now, I was embarrassingly naive. How could I have missed such a lame excuse?

I pushed the door open and walked in.

Chase looked up. His expression didn’t change—not even a flicker of guilt.

Maddie immediately stood and rushed to my side. “Sierra! You didn’t come home last night. Mom and Dad were freaking out. Where were you?”

Everyone turned to look at me, whispering behind their drinks.

“Seriously? Hooking up with someone the night after SATs? Yikes.”

“Thought she was a brainiac. Guess she’s wild behind the scenes.”

Maddie wore a look of innocent concern, but her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

I saw right through her.

“It’s none of your business,” I said calmly, trying to walk past her.

But she latched onto my arm like a loving little sister. “Sit next to me. The seat is available.”

She tugged a little too hard, and my collar slipped.

The marks Chase had left on me the night before were on full display—bruised and violet, unmistakable.

Maddie gasped. “Sierra, what happened to you?”

Every gaze in the room locked onto me—shocked, curious, judgmental.

“So much for the innocent honor student…”

“Jesus, how rough was it? Look at those hickeys.”

“She’s not even dating anyone, is she? Must’ve been some random hookup after finals.”

Face burning, I yanked my collar back into place and turned instinctively toward Chase.

He didn’t even look at me.

He was still talking with Maddie, his face soft, gentle… like none of this had anything to do with him.

My heart hardened.

“It’s nothing,” I said coolly. “Got bit by a dog. I’m allergic.”

A worthless stray dog, at that.

Chapter3
Laughter erupted around the room as everyone joked about which mangy mutt had left those “bite marks” on me.

Chase’s face darkened. He knocked on the table. “Everyone’s here. Let’s get started.”

His voice cut through the noise instantly.

The Class President quickly stood up to ease the awkwardness. “Yeah, enjoy yourself. We’ll all be heading our separate ways soon—college, work, wherever. Might be the last time we’re all in the same room.”

People started sharing their summer plans.

Some were heading south for factory jobs. Some had graduation trips booked. Others were rushing to get their driver’s licenses.

Dinner wrapped up, and the party moved into a private karaoke lounge.

We played games. One of them was a dare.

Maddie got picked and had to choose a guy to give her a princess carry for a full minute.

The guys immediately started cheering. Maddie blushed and glanced at Chase. “Chase, can you help me?”

Without a word, Chase leaned down, one arm slipping behind her knees, muscles flexing as he lifted her effortlessly into the air.

“Hold on tight.”

Maddie let out a soft gasp, wrapping her arms around his neck, her laughter sugary-sweet.

“Damn, Walker’s a beast! No wonder he’s on varsity!”

I looked away, curling my fingers into fists beneath the table. I tried to pretend it didn’t bother me.

Then it was my turn.

The dare? Take three shots of vodka—or kiss any guy in the room.

The guys all grinned, already whispering.

I instinctively glanced at Chase.

He avoided my eyes.

“I already played knight tonight,” he said flatly. “I’m sitting out the rest.”

The words hit like a slap.

I picked up the shot glass and knocked it back.

Then another.

Then another.

The vodka burned down my throat like acid. My eyes stung. I stumbled out of the room and into the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before throwing it all up.

I splashed water on my face, rinsed my mouth over and over until the burning eased.

When I looked up, the mirror showed a mess.

Red eyes. Hair tangled. Collar askew, with faint bruises peeking out beneath the fabric.

I looked like a clown.

I tugged my clothes straight, brushed out my hair, and gave myself the most pathetic smile I could muster.

“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “pain teaches you lessons. You’ll be better because of this. Pull youself together.”

I didn’t go back into the room.

I texted the Class President that I was heading home and left.

On the bus, I pulled out my phone and opened our old iMessage thread.

[Sierra, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?]

[Sierra, I couldn’t sleep again tonight. I kept thinking about you. I miss you.]

Dozens of sweet nothings. Dozens of selfies—Chase posing with his bike, dunking at the school court, us walking to school in our Westhaven High uniforms.

When I got a new phone last year, I refused to delete any of it.

But now…

With trembling fingers, I selected the entire chat.

6.9 GB. Delete?

Yes.

Everything we had—all our memories, all his empty words—were gone with a tap.

It was like we were never anything at all.

The bus pulled to a stop. I wiped my face and stood up.

I walked home.

The second I stepped through the front door, a sharp slap knocked me to the floor.

My ears rang.

“You shameless brat!” my father roared. “Staying out all night and drinking like some party girl? ”

Half my face throbbed with heat. My head spun as I looked up from the floor—only to see Maddie and Mom sitting on the couch, watching it all with smug satisfaction.

I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth.

“The Class President threw the party,” I rasped. “I only had a little, and I threw it all up. Maddie can vouch for me.”

But Maddie blinked, all innocence. “He did throw the party, but Sierra left halfway without saying anything. I can’t back her up.”

Mom’s face hardened.

“Sierra Hayes, how many times have I told you to learn from your sister? If you do, your father wouldn’t be this upset.”

I knelt on the floor, my cheek red and swollen.

They sat hand in hand on the sofa. Picture perfect.

My eyes drifted to the coffee table.

There sat a vacation contract: “Westhaven Students Celebrate SAT Success – 3-Person Family Trip to Cancun!”

My heart dropped.

My parents’ names were signed. So was Maddie’s.

“You’re taking Maddie on a trip… and leaving me behind?” I asked.

Mom’s eyes flickered. “Maddie won it in a school raffle. There are only three spots. We’re going with her because it’s fair.”

“You can stay home and think about your behavior. We’ll take you next time.”

I gave a cold smile. “And when exactly is next time?”

Maddie had always been the fragile one. The doctors said I’d stolen her nutrients in the womb.

Since then, my parents had spoiled her relentlessly.

When I won a doll in elementary school, Maddie said she liked it. Mom made me give it to her.

When there were only a few drumsticks or Buffalo wings left at dinner, Maddie got first pick. I got whatever was left.

Every time, Mom said, “Next time means next time. Be the bigger sister.”

But that “next time” never came.

She didn’t answer.

Dad raised his hand again, ready to strike.

“What? Go to your room. You’re grounded.”

I stumbled up the stairs, clutching the wall as pain echoed through my chest.

Not long after, a text came in from Mr. Carter.

[Sierra, come to school tomorrow morning. We’ll go over your SAT scores and work on your college major declaration.]

[Okay.]

I curled up in bed, holding the phone.

This was my chance.

College wasn’t just a way out—it was my way forward.

A chance to escape this family. To build something for myself.

Chapter4
Mr. Carter paused, clearly surprised by my request.

“You know the education resources in the Northwest aren’t anywhere near what Columbia offers. Why the sudden interest in moving out there?”

I gave him the answer I’d stayed up all night rehearsing. “I know. But I made my desicion.”

He looked at me with something like admiration, but still hesitated. “This is a huge decision, Sierra. Maybe talk it over with your parents?”

I shook my head, polite but firm. “I’m eighteen. Legally an adult. I want to make this decision on my own. And… I’d really appreciate it if you kept this private for now. I’m not ready for anyone else to know.”

Seeing how serious I was, Mr. Carter didn’t push back. He helped me fill out the application for the early admission program at Northwest Institute of Science and submitted it through the portal right then and there.

“You better start packing,” he said. “If everything goes smoothly, you’ll be leaving by the start of next month.”

I thanked him over and over before stepping out of the office.

And walked straight into Chase.

His eyes searched mine, emotions roiling beneath the surface. “Mr. Carter said you’re leaving. What’s he talking about? Where are you going?”

I didn’t want to explain. “He just meant college is starting soon. We’ll all be heading off in different directions.”

I kept walking, but he followed, sticking to my side as we descended the stairs.

“You didn’t send me a goodnight text last night. Were you mad? I didn’t mean to ignore you at the party—it’s just, everyone was teasing me about being with Maddie. I didn’t want to embarrass her.”

He reached out, trying to ruffle my hair like he always used to.

But I stepped away.

He froze.

I looked him right in the eye. “Chase, Maddie and I are twins. Have you ever stopped to think… maybe the one you liked all along was her?”

His expression shifted. “What? No. That’s not true. If I liked Maddie, why would I date you?”

“Sierra, I’m already yours, okay? You’re not trying to back out of this, are you?”

I held his gaze, heart pounding.

But before I could say anything more, a voice called from around the corner.

“Chase!” Maddie’s sweet, sing-song tone echoed down the hallway. “Didn’t you promise to help me go over my scores?”

Chase immediately turned. “Yeah! I’m coming!”

He looked back at me, apologetic. “I told Maddie I’d help her figure out her college options. Don’t overthink it. I’ll help you after, okay?”

Then he jogged off.

I didn’t say a word.

All I could do was watch him walk away.

As he and Maddie headed off together, the underclassmen couldn’t stop whispering.

“Chase and Maddie look so cute together.”

“I thought graduation season was when couples break up, not get sweeter.”

“I heard they’re both applying to Columbia.”

“Duh, they’re totally dating. My cousin was at their grad party last night—he saw them kissing.”

The words hit me like little darts.

So… after I left, they’d gone even further.

I guess I’d made the right call choosing the early admission program.

Once I left, Chase wouldn’t have to keep pretending.

And I wouldn’t have to watch it anymore.

I headed back to the dorms to pack.

In the bottom of my desk drawer, I found my old journal. The one I hadn’t touched in months.

Page after page was filled with memories of me and Chase—dates, fights, moments that had once felt unforgettable.

I tore each page out, one by one, and dropped them into the trash.

A photo slipped loose from between the pages—Chase, mid-air during a basketball game, looking like something out of a teen sports movie.

I bent down to pick it up, but someone beat me to it.

“Whoa—aren’t Chase and Maddie a thing now?” one girl said, holding the picture up.

“Sierra, why are you hiding his photo like some stalker ex?”

Another snickered. “Guess twins really do share everything—same face, same taste in guys.”

“Seriously, get a grip,” a third girl sneered. “Fantasizing about your sister’s boyfriend? Pathetic.”

I snatched the photo back, eyes cold. “Throwing out baseless rumors isn’t just immature—it’s defamation. I don’t like Chase. And I’m not the type to cling to other people’s leftovers.”

Right in front of all of them, I ripped the photo to pieces and tossed them out the window.

The fragments fluttered down like confetti, landing right on Chase’s shoulders as he passed by outside.

He looked up, confused.

His eyes met mine through the open window.

And just like that, the last thread between us snapped.

Chapter5
“Sierra Hayes, what’s your problem?” Chase’s tone held clear frustration.

I didn’t respond. Just turned away, calm and collected, and headed back to my dorm to keep packing.

He called me—multiple times. I didn’t pick up a single one.

Do Not Disturb mode: on.

When I finished gathering everything, I stepped out of the girls’ dorm and found Chase waiting right at the front entrance.

He held out his palm—filled with tiny shredded bits of a photo.

“Explain this.”

Under the sweltering sun, he’d stood there picking up every torn piece. Sweat rolled down his neck, that familiar scent of summer clinging to his skin.

I looked him dead in the eye and said coolly, “I was packing when one of my roommates saw it. You told me not to go public with our relationship, right? So I had no choice but to tear it up. Didn’t want to cause a scene.”

Chase faltered, clearly caught off guard. Some of his anger drained away.

“I’m not trying to hide you,” he said eventually. “It’s just… not the right time yet.”

“It’s fine. I understand,” I said, keeping my voice steady.

Deep down, I knew.

He was never really mine to begin with.

It was always Maddie.

Chase clearly didn’t want to argue. He shoved the photo scraps into his pocket and quickly pulled out a few SAT practice sheets. “Here, I got copies of this year’s test. Let’s go over it—I’ll help estimate your score.”

“No need,” I replied. “Mr. Carter already helped me with that.”

I brushed off his sudden kindness, slung my backpack over my shoulder, and walked toward the front gate.

He stood there watching me, not moving.

But I was done looking back.

As I walked down the gingko-lined avenue, the sound of cicadas mixed with the buzz of teachers giving lectures to the underclassmen.

I caught my last sunset at Westhaven High.

That was it.

My high school chapter had officially ended.

With the sky lit up in golden red, I turned toward the bus stop to head home.

Just as I stepped into the crosswalk, I heard the shrill ring of a bike bell.

Maddie.

She barreled straight toward me on her bike.

I barely had time to dodge, but—

BAM.

The collision knocked me flat. It felt like being punched full-force in the gut.

Maddie slammed straight into a steel ad board. The crash echoed loud, and she tumbled off her bike with a shriek.

“Mad!” Chase’s voice rang out from across the street.

He sprinted over, chest heaving, and went straight to her.

He helped Maddie up first.

“Sierra, what were you thinking?! Running in front of her like that—do you know how dangerous that was?!”

Blood trickled from the scrape on my knee, but I still managed to shout, “She swerved across the road and hit me!”

Maddie clung weakly to his arms, tears rolling down her cheeks.

“I just wanted to say hi to my sister… I didn’t mean to. The brakes stopped working, I couldn’t steer… I didn’t mean it.”

Chase’s voice instantly softened. “It’s okay, it’s okay. Let’s get you to the hospital.”

He was about to pick her up when several security guards ran over.

One pointed angrily at the toppled ad sign. “This board cost our company five thousand bucks to install! Someone better pay for this, and I mean full price.”

His eyes flicked between the three of us like a predator picking his prey.

Maddie stiffened in Chase’s arms—then pointed at me.

“It was her. She was riding the bike. She hit me, then crashed into your sign. If you’re looking for someone to pay, ask her.”

I stared at Maddie in disbelief.

She lied.

Right to their faces.

I turned to the guards. “It wasn’t me. She hit me. If you don’t believe me, ask this guy—he saw the whole thing!”

The guards looked to Chase. I looked to him too, praying he’d finally tell the truth.

After a long pause, he raised his hand and pointed.

“It was her,” he said.

He was pointing… at me.

Chapter6
Chase left with Maddie.

And I was left to deal with the security guards alone.

No matter how I explained, they wouldn’t listen.

They grabbed my student ID and barked, “Sierra Hayes, right? You better bring the money by tomorrow. If not, we’re reporting this to the School Board. One call, and they’ll cancel your SAT scores for misconduct.”

With that, they walked off, leaving me speechless.

I had no way to prove my innocence. So I went home, hoping to figure out a plan.

But as soon as I walked through the door, my mom exploded.

“Can you just be an adult for once? Hooking up in hotels, drinking, and now destroying public property? Grow up, Sierra!”

She threw a wad of cash at me.

“You’re mad because we didn’t take you on vacation, right? Fine. Take this and go pay them. We can’t afford more embarrassment.”

Maddie sat nearby, watching the scene unfold like it was entertainment.

I clenched my fists. “I didn’t do it. Maddie was the one who rode into the sign—and into me.”

I lifted my skirt to show the bruise and scrapes on my knee.

Dad slammed his hand on the table.

“How dare you blame this on your sister?! That five thousand—half of it is from her own allowance! She’s offering to cover it for you, and you want her to take the fall too? Is this what being an older sister means to you?”

The heat rushed to my face.

All my life, whenever it came to Maddie, they never cared who was actually right.

I was their daughter too.

So why was I always the one left behind?

“No, I didn’t do it. And I don’t want Maddie’s money.”

I said it loud and clear, then turned around and walked out.

I returned to the site of the crash, checking every angle. Finally, behind a row of gingko trees, I found a security camera.

I snapped a photo of it and headed straight for the police station.

Just as I reached the steps, Chase grabbed me from behind and pulled me aside to the park nearby.

“What are you doing at the station?” he asked, frowning.

“I found footage from a security cam,” I said. “It proves I didn’t crash the ad board.”

His expression instantly shifted.

“You can’t let this escalate. It’ll make everything worse. I already paid the guards. It’s done, okay? Just let it go.”

His words made something crack inside me.

“Chase… Maddie lied and blamed the accident on me. she did it. And you want me to let it go?”

He looked away, clearly guilty, and held my hand.

“You told me your parents always coddled your sister. She’s fragile—she can’t take blames. But you’re different. You’ve always been stronger. A few harsh words don’t break you.”

I stared at him, stunned.

Had he really just said that?

I remembered the night I broke down in his arms, crying that my parents only cared about Maddie. That they never saw me.

He’d held me close and whispered, “Sierra, I’ll be your family. I’ll love you forever.”

He’d promised to choose me—when no one else ever did.

Now?

Those words felt like a joke.

I pulled my hand away.

Chase seemed to realize how cruel he sounded. He knelt down and checked my injury.

“Your leg… does it still hurt? I brought medicine.”

“I don’t need it.”

He reached out anyway, holding my leg firmly. “Don’t move. Let me help.”

He applied ointment carefully, almost tenderly.

But I felt… nothing.

No comfort.

No warmth.

Just numb.

When he finished, I stood and stepped back.

“It’s getting late. Go home. I want to be alone.”

He grabbed my wrist. “I know you’re upset. Let’s see a movie. Take your mind off things.”

Before I could refuse, he dragged me into a private screening room.

Popcorn. Soda. Cozy lighting.

The movie started—and it was very much not PG.

My face turned red. I reached for the remote, but he pulled me into his arms.

“We’ve done more intimate things than this, haven’t we? No need to be shy.”

The film got even steamier. His hands started to wander.

I shoved him away.

Chase’s voice dropped low, husky with lust. “I’m sorry I hurt you last time. I didn’t know what I was doing. But this time… we’ll learn. I promise I’ll make you feel good.”

He dragged me into his lap.

Chapter7
My heart clenched tight, and I shot up from the couch. “Don’t.”

Chase froze, just for a second. Then, like that night after the SATs, he tried coaxing me again, his voice low and persuasive.

“The private screening room’s great for couples. No one will bother us.”

He reached for me again, but I shoved the door open before he could pull me in.

“It’s late. I’m heading home.”

I didn’t look back.

I didn’t actually want to go home. I just didn’t want to sleep with Chase. I needed to put some distance between us.

That night after the exam was our first time. And it would be our last.

I wandered aimlessly down the street. My phone buzzed twice in my pocket.

I thought it was Chase. But when I checked, it was a message from the system:

[Hello, Sierra Hayes. Your background review has passed. Please report to City Hospital within three days for your medical evaluation...]

I locked my screen and let out a long breath.

Soon, I’d be gone from this place. And honestly, thank God.

The next few days, I stayed off the grid. I didn’t text Chase, didn’t care what our parents were doing for Maddie. I had bigger things to focus on—my own future.

I went to the hospital alone for my medical checkup, did the physical and interview at the ROTC office, and finished all the early admission requirements.

Then came the day I went back to pick up my medical report—and saw Chase and Maddie walking out of the women’s health wing together.

I stopped short. Just for a second.

They were… that close already?

A tangle of emotions hit me all at once. I clutched the folder in my hand and turned away quickly, wanting to get as far away from them as possible.

But the moment I stepped outside, Maddie ran after me.

“Sis? What are you doing at the hospital?” she asked, her tone feigned concern but loud enough for others to hear. “Did you forget to take the emergency pills after sex with that blond guy? Or worse, did he give you something?”

People around us started glancing over.

I stared at her coldly. “I’m just here for my medical report. But you? Coming out of Women’s Health with Chase—what, you catch something nasty?”

“Never!” Maddie’s face turned bright red.

“I only asked Chase to come with me to meet a professor from the med school. He’s helping me figure out my college major!”

“Then next time, maybe don’t spread rumors if you can’t handle being misunderstood.” My voice dropped, sharp and icy. I turned to leave.

But Maddie wasn’t done. Her pride must’ve been bruised, because she lashed out, voice rising.

“Sierra Hayes, once I’m back from vacation with Mom and Dad, I’m going to study pre-med at the top program in the state. They already said they’d pull every string to get me into the best hospital in Westhaven after I graduate.”

“And you? You’re on your own. They won’t care about you. You’ll just rot.”

I froze. So they’d already planned her entire future.

And me? I had nothing.

But it was fine. I had already carved out my own bloody path, and I wasn’t about to stop now.

I didn’t want to make a scene, so I kept walking.

But Maddie wouldn’t let it go. She grabbed my wrist and hissed, “You still like Chase, don’t you? That’s why you followed us here. But you’re not even a virgin anymore—what makes you think he’d still want you?”

Her words made me laugh out loud.

“Oh please. Whether he wants me or not doesn’t matter. His first time’s gone too.”

Maddie’s expression cracked. “What do you mean by that?”

I didn’t bother answering. I yanked my hand away.

Then suddenly—she slapped herself.

I caught her wrist just in time. “Seriously? You’re going to fake a slap and pin it on me again?”

But her eyes welled up instantly, big fat tears streaming down her cheeks.

“Ow… Sis, you’re hurting me…”

“What the hell are you doing?” Chase stormed over and yanked me away, pulling Maddie behind him protectively.

I hadn’t even said a word before Maddie sniffled, putting on her show.

“She said we must’ve caught something just ‘cause we came out of Women’s Health together…”

Chase glared at me, face stormy.

“Maddie and I were meeting with a professor to talk about majors. What the hell, Sierra? You think everyone’s as easy as you?”

My heart stopped.

It felt like someone had hit me across the head.

And Chase… the second the words left his mouth, he looked horrified. Regret colored his face.

“I— That’s not what I meant, I didn’t—”

I cut him off.

“Then tell me, Chase—what exactly are you to Maddie? What right do you have to follow her around like a boyfriend and still criticize me like a judge?”

He went silent. His eyes searched mine like he had a thousand things to say.

But I was done listening.

I turned and walked away.

A relationship he didn’t have the guts to acknowledge? I’d long stopped wanting it anyway.

That night at 9 p.m., I logged into the SAT score system to check my results. But instead of a number, the screen read:

[Due to ranking in the top 30 statewide, your SAT score has been temporarily hidden.]

My score had been flagged and locked by the system.

I stared at the screen, stunned for a beat.

Then it hit me—I did it. I actually did it.

Just then, my phone rang.

“Hello, is this Sierra Hayes? This is the Northwest Institute of Science’s early admission office. We’ve received and verified your application—we’re happy to inform you that you’ve been admitted directly.”

“There’s one condition: Our campus enforces strict military-style management. All students are required to surrender their phones and remain fully disconnected from the outside world—including contact with family. Do you accept?”

I gripped the phone tightly. “This is Sierra Hayes. I accept it. I’m ready to give it everything I’ve got.”

Chapter8
“Excellent. A shuttle will pick you up at South Station in Westhaven two days from now, at 8 a.m. sharp. Welcome aboard.”

“Understood!”

I hung up.

For the first time in forever, I felt… free.

In just two days, I’d leave Westhaven. Leave Mom. Leave Chase.

And once I was gone, no one would ever find me again.

It was almost time. I started packing my suitcase.

Mom walked by and frowned when she saw me folding clothes.

“Sierra, we already said we’re taking Maddie to vacation tomorrow. What’s the packing about?—there’s no space for you.”

“I don’t want to go with you.” I pulled up my early admission confirmation to show her. “Mom, the scores dropped today. I got—”

Before I could finish, Maddie swooped in, playing the worried little sister.

“You didn’t bomb the test, did you?”

“What?” Mom’s face twisted in disbelief as she looked at me, eyes full of disappointment. “Is that true, Sierra?”

Dad had overheard from the living room and came marching over.

“Your sister did well in the exam. She can choose any school in Westhaven or even Columbia. What about you? ”

The anger and doubt on their faces hit like a slap.

Suddenly, I didn’t want to say anything at all.

All those years of trying, all the pain I’d buried… it all bubbled up.

“You assume I failed without hearing a word from me. Is that really how little you think of me?”

“When I got first in the whole school, you called it cheating. Said it was dumb luck. When I stayed up late studying, you said I was pretending for attention.”

“But when Maddie barely scraped into the top hundred, you said she was hardworking. When she stayed up past 9:30 doing homework, you said she was amazing.”

“Mom. Dad. We’re both your daughters. So why does it feel like I’ve never mattered?”

Mom said nothing. Dad, furious, slammed his palm against the doorframe.

“Watch your mouth!”

“We’ve always treated you two the same!”

“Maddie’s never caused trouble. You’re the one always testing our patience. And now you want to turn around and blame us? What kind of ungrateful daughter are you?”

Still seething, he threw down the final blow.

“If you really think we’re unfair—get out. You’re eighteen. We’re done raising a thankless brat like you.”

“You didn’t get into college? Fine. Go make your own damn living!”

Mom tried to rein him in, pulling him toward the door. But before she left, she still tossed one last dagger over her shoulder.

“Sierra, I gave birth yto you. I love you. But you’ve disappointed us too many times.”

Then she left with Maddie in tow.

I clenched my jaw and shut the door behind them, locking myself into the silence.

I curled up on my bed, staring at the photo on my nightstand—our “perfect” family of four.

In the picture, my parents held five-year-old Maddie in the center like a precious gem, while I stood quietly on the edge, wearing the same princess dress.

But love? Love was never equal.

I didn’t see it clearly until I was eighteen.

I tore the photo out of the frame and ripped out the little girl version of me.

“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “from now on, be strong. Be proud. Love yourself the way no one ever did.”

Tears poured down as I clutched that torn paper to my chest.

That little girl who was never loved—I was holding her now. I’d heal her myself.

My childhood? I’d fix it.

My future? I’d build it.

I cried for what felt like hours, raw and aching.

Then, out of nowhere, Chase called.

“Hey, Sierra. Did you check your SAT score yet? I just got a special offer from Columbia! Did you get a call from them too?”

He sounded so excited.

But my heart had gone still.

“I did.”

Just not from Columbia.

He didn’t know the truth. On the other end, he let out a happy whistle.

“That’s awesome! We can go to college together! There’s gonna be fireworks by the riverside tomorrow night. Let’s celebrate, just the two of us?”

I hesitated, then said softly, “Sure.”

I had already said goodbye to my family.

Now it was time to end things with Chase.

My childhood. My youth. Everything I’d been through…

Before I left, I needed to write the final chapter myself.

I have been wondering if the extraction method yields different extractions not just of caffeine but of the other methylxanthines in the coffee bean and of terpenes and other compounds that have an effect.

I found the linked paper that confirms that caffeine is not the only psychoactive compound in caffeine. But it doesn’t address the potential differential effects of brew method.

He Took My Body, Then Called My Sister’s Name

Chapter1
The moment the SATs were over, I slept with Chase Walker for the first time.
In the heat of it all, I gasped out loud—only to hear him whisper a name that wasn’t mine.
“Maddie…”
But my name is Sierra. Maddie is my twin sister.

I blinked, stunned, and looked up at him. “Who did you just say?”

Chase kept moving, lowering his head to kiss my eyelids. “Sierra,” he murmured, his voice thick, “don’t get distracted. You’re enjoying this, right?”

His rhythm quickened, driving away every ounce of doubt I had left.

Chase was a jock—strong, tireless, and always creative. My body trembled uncontrollably beneath him. I tried to push him away. “Don’t…”

He leaned into my ear, voice hoarse with desire. “Baby, let’s try it on top this time.”

That night, he wore me down—again and again—until I was crying, begging, shaking, and still he didn’t stop.

Not until sunrise did he finally stumble into the bathroom, satisfied.

I lay there, too sore to move, my limbs aching like they didn’t belong to me.

Then his phone on the nightstand started blowing up with notification pings.

Instinctively, I glanced at the screen—and froze.

[Congrats, Walker! You finally got some last night!]

My heart dropped. I couldn’t stop myself. I unlocked his phone and opened the group chat.

What I saw made my entire body go numb.

He’d sent a photo of the bloodstained hotel bedsheet. In the middle of the night.

The messages came in a flood:

[Holy crap, Chase—you really did it with Sierra? I thought you were into Maddie?]

[C’mon, they’re twins. Same face, same body. He’s just warming up with Sierra before he goes all in with Maddie. Practice makes perfect, right?]

[Exactly. He’s in love with Maddie. Sierra’s just a stand-in so he doesn’t screw it up with the real thing.]

Every word felt like a slap.

I’d spent hours wondering why Chase liked me. I’d imagined a thousand reasons—none of them this.

Chase wasn’t just a jock. He was the school's golden boy, surrounded by friends and admiration.

I was the quiet one. The bookworm everyone ignored.

We shouldn’t have had anything in common. But one day back in junior year, during gym, I’d accidentally bled through my pants from my period.

Chase had taken off his team jacket and wrapped it around my waist.

Since then, he’d left breakfast on my desk every morning. Tucked handwritten notes in my school loker.

I’d fallen—hard. But I never understood why someone like him would choose someone like me.

So one day I asked, “What do you like about me?”

He smiled and said, “Because you’re you.”

That first love, the kind you believe will last forever—I’d given it my all.

I thought losing my virginity to him meant something.

Turns out, it was just a performance. A carefully orchestrated “first time,” for his benefit.

I clenched my fists so tightly my knuckles turned white, my palms streaked with red. But nothing hurt more than my heart.

The water stopped running. I rushed to put his phone back and pretend nothing happened.

The door opened. Chase walked out, dripping water, a towel slung low on his hips. His tanned skin glistened with drops, muscles sculpted and bare.

“You’re up. Hungry?”

He came to the bed, voice gentle, eyes dark with something I couldn’t name. He glanced down at the bruises on my collarbone.

I couldn’t answer. All I could hear was the echo of his voice last night—calling me Maddie.

“I’m not hungry.”

He saw the redness at the corners of my eyes and immediately pulled me into his arms. “Did I hurt you? I didn’t mean to—I just… I was new to this. I’ll get better. We can keep practicing.”

His hand slid under my shirt again.

I flinched away. “Don’t. I’m sore.”

He paused, then slowly smoothed down my wrinkled collar, his voice soft with guilt. “I lost control last night. Have some rest, I’ll go downstairs and grab you breakfast.”

He got dressed and left.

I stared at the blood on the white sheets and felt my entire body go hollow.

For two years, we’d been secretly dating. I’d hidden everything from my teachers, from my friends. I did everything he asked, said yes to everything.

He wanted Columbia, so I made it my dream too.

He held my hand under the desk during class; I blushed and kept reciting vocab.

He asked to meet me behind the field after study hall; I gave him my first kiss.

Now the exams were over, he wanted a symbolic “rite of passage,” and I gave him everything.

I thought it was love.

But it was just rehearsal.

If Maddie was who he loved from the beginning, then I didn’t want to love him anymore. I didn’t want to be the stand-in.

I got dressed and left the hotel.

At a pharmacy down the street, I awkwardly asked the clerk for emergency contraceptive pills.

She eyed me up and down, frowning, and pulled a box from the shelf. “You should’ve had your boyfriend use protection. These are awful for your body, you know.”

My face burned. I could barely speak.

There were condoms in the drawer beside the bed. I’d told Chase to grab a box.

But he’d just moaned in my ear, red-eyed and desperate.

“Sierra… it feels weird with that stuff on. Please, just this once. I swear I won’t go too far.”

I gave in.

And now here I was, buying back my freedom one pill at a time.

“Thanks,” I told the clerk as I paid. “Just this once.”

Never again.

Never again would I believe anything Chase Walker said.

Chapter2
I had barely stepped out of the pharmacy when I heard whispers behind me.

“Just like a hooker.”

“She looked so sweet… But...Unbelievable.”

Their words lashed across my face like a whip, burning hot from my cheeks all the way to my chest.

I hurried away, clutching the paper bag, my vision blurring. At the bus stop, I washed down the white pill with a bottle of water.

I drank too fast. The water caught in my throat, and I started coughing so hard my eyes watered.

“Sierra!”

Chase came running up, out of breath, worry etched into every feature.

“Why’d you leave the hotel without telling me? I texted, I called. Where have you been?”

The way he said it—like I was the one being cruel—it almost made me laugh.

Almost.

But all I felt was this sharp, twisting ache in my chest.

“I went to buy emergency contraception,” I said, holding up the now-empty pill box.

His expression faltered. Embarrassment crept into his eyes.

“You could’ve told me. Or let me go get it. I was worried.”

I didn’t want to argue over this. “It won’t happen again.”

He sensed something was off. He reached for my hand. “I’m sorry I lost control last night. I’ll be more careful next time.”

Then he smiled. “Hey, the Class President is throwing a graduation party at Capital Square. Come with me?”

I pulled my hand back. “No one knows we’re together. It’s better if we go separately.”

Chase stiffened. After a moment, he nodded.

“Okay. I’ll grab a cab.”

I didn’t reply. I just got on the next bus.

He had promised we’d go public after the SATs.

But for the past few days, while he chatted away in the group chat, not once had he mentioned me.

And I’d already seen the truth in that secret text thread with his friends.

There was no relationship to announce.

By the time I got to the private dining room at Capital Square, the place was packed.

Maddie, dressed in a pink Lolita-style dress, sat surrounded like some Disney princess. Chase was right next to her, peeling cherries and handing them to her one by one.

A few classmates started teasing, “Chase, you’ve been so good to the Prom Queen all year. You better shoot your shot before college. Once you get to Columbia, there’ll be too many options!”

Everyone had seen how good Chase was to Maddie.

Even though he was secretly dating me, publicly, he was always by Maddie’s side—helping her clean up after class, saving her a spot in the lunch line, carrying her books.

He was even the one who rallied the guys to vote her Prom Queen.

But we were twins. We looked almost identical.

Back then, he’d explained, “Maddie’s got a weaker constitution. People tend to bully her. You’re stronger, Sierra. You have me.”

I actually believed it. I believed he loved me so much, he was kind to my sister too.

Looking back now, I was embarrassingly naive. How could I have missed such a lame excuse?

I pushed the door open and walked in.

Chase looked up. His expression didn’t change—not even a flicker of guilt.

Maddie immediately stood and rushed to my side. “Sierra! You didn’t come home last night. Mom and Dad were freaking out. Where were you?”

Everyone turned to look at me, whispering behind their drinks.

“Seriously? Hooking up with someone the night after SATs? Yikes.”

“Thought she was a brainiac. Guess she’s wild behind the scenes.”

Maddie wore a look of innocent concern, but her eyes gleamed with satisfaction.

I saw right through her.

“It’s none of your business,” I said calmly, trying to walk past her.

But she latched onto my arm like a loving little sister. “Sit next to me. The seat is available.”

She tugged a little too hard, and my collar slipped.

The marks Chase had left on me the night before were on full display—bruised and violet, unmistakable.

Maddie gasped. “Sierra, what happened to you?”

Every gaze in the room locked onto me—shocked, curious, judgmental.

“So much for the innocent honor student…”

“Jesus, how rough was it? Look at those hickeys.”

“She’s not even dating anyone, is she? Must’ve been some random hookup after finals.”

Face burning, I yanked my collar back into place and turned instinctively toward Chase.

He didn’t even look at me.

He was still talking with Maddie, his face soft, gentle… like none of this had anything to do with him.

My heart hardened.

“It’s nothing,” I said coolly. “Got bit by a dog. I’m allergic.”

A worthless stray dog, at that.

Chapter3
Laughter erupted around the room as everyone joked about which mangy mutt had left those “bite marks” on me.

Chase’s face darkened. He knocked on the table. “Everyone’s here. Let’s get started.”

His voice cut through the noise instantly.

The Class President quickly stood up to ease the awkwardness. “Yeah, enjoy yourself. We’ll all be heading our separate ways soon—college, work, wherever. Might be the last time we’re all in the same room.”

People started sharing their summer plans.

Some were heading south for factory jobs. Some had graduation trips booked. Others were rushing to get their driver’s licenses.

Dinner wrapped up, and the party moved into a private karaoke lounge.

We played games. One of them was a dare.

Maddie got picked and had to choose a guy to give her a princess carry for a full minute.

The guys immediately started cheering. Maddie blushed and glanced at Chase. “Chase, can you help me?”

Without a word, Chase leaned down, one arm slipping behind her knees, muscles flexing as he lifted her effortlessly into the air.

“Hold on tight.”

Maddie let out a soft gasp, wrapping her arms around his neck, her laughter sugary-sweet.

“Damn, Walker’s a beast! No wonder he’s on varsity!”

I looked away, curling my fingers into fists beneath the table. I tried to pretend it didn’t bother me.

Then it was my turn.

The dare? Take three shots of vodka—or kiss any guy in the room.

The guys all grinned, already whispering.

I instinctively glanced at Chase.

He avoided my eyes.

“I already played knight tonight,” he said flatly. “I’m sitting out the rest.”

The words hit like a slap.

I picked up the shot glass and knocked it back.

Then another.

Then another.

The vodka burned down my throat like acid. My eyes stung. I stumbled out of the room and into the bathroom, barely making it to the sink before throwing it all up.

I splashed water on my face, rinsed my mouth over and over until the burning eased.

When I looked up, the mirror showed a mess.

Red eyes. Hair tangled. Collar askew, with faint bruises peeking out beneath the fabric.

I looked like a clown.

I tugged my clothes straight, brushed out my hair, and gave myself the most pathetic smile I could muster.

“Sierra Hayes,” I whispered, “pain teaches you lessons. You’ll be better because of this. Pull youself together.”

I didn’t go back into the room.

I texted the Class President that I was heading home and left.

On the bus, I pulled out my phone and opened our old iMessage thread.

[Sierra, I like you. Will you be my girlfriend?]

[Sierra, I couldn’t sleep again tonight. I kept thinking about you. I miss you.]

Dozens of sweet nothings. Dozens of selfies—Chase posing with his bike, dunking at the school court, us walking to school in our Westhaven High uniforms.

When I got a new phone last year, I refused to delete any of it.

But now…

With trembling fingers, I selected the entire chat.

6.9 GB. Delete?

Yes.

Everything we had—all our memories, all his empty words—were gone with a tap.

It was like we were never anything at all.

The bus pulled to a stop. I wiped my face and stood up.

I walked home.

The second I stepped through the front door, a sharp slap knocked me to the floor.

My ears rang.

“You shameless brat!” my father roared. “Staying out all night and drinking like some party girl? ”

Half my face throbbed with heat. My head spun as I looked up from the floor—only to see Maddie and Mom sitting on the couch, watching it all with smug satisfaction.

I wiped the blood from the corner of my mouth.

“The Class President threw the party,” I rasped. “I only had a little, and I threw it all up. Maddie can vouch for me.”

But Maddie blinked, all innocence. “He did throw the party, but Sierra left halfway without saying anything. I can’t back her up.”

Mom’s face hardened.

“Sierra Hayes, how many times have I told you to learn from your sister? If you do, your father wouldn’t be this upset.”

I knelt on the floor, my cheek red and swollen.

They sat hand in hand on the sofa. Picture perfect.

My eyes drifted to the coffee table.

There sat a vacation contract: “Westhaven Students Celebrate SAT Success – 3-Person Family Trip to Cancun!”

My heart dropped.

My parents’ names were signed. So was Maddie’s.

“You’re taking Maddie on a trip… and leaving me behind?” I asked.

Mom’s eyes flickered. “Maddie won it in a school raffle. There are only three spots. We’re going with her because it’s fair.”

“You can stay home and think about your behavior. We’ll take you next time.”

I gave a cold smile. “And when exactly is next time?”

Maddie had always been the fragile one. The doctors said I’d stolen her nutrients in the womb.

Since then, my parents had spoiled her relentlessly.

When I won a doll in elementary school, Maddie said she liked it. Mom made me give it to her.

When there were only a few drumsticks or Buffalo wings left at dinner, Maddie got first pick. I got whatever was left.

Every time, Mom said, “Next time means next time. Be the bigger sister.”

But that “next time” never came.

She didn’t answer.

Dad raised his hand again, ready to strike.

“What? Go to your room. You’re grounded.”

I stumbled up the stairs, clutching the wall as pain echoed through my chest.

Not long after, a text came in from Mr. Carter.

[Sierra, come to school tomorrow morning. We’ll go over your SAT scores and work on your college major declaration.]

[Okay.]

I curled up in bed, holding the phone.

This was my chance.

College wasn’t just a way out—it was my way forward.

A chance to escape this family. To build something for myself.

Chapter4
Mr. Carter paused, clearly surprised by my request.

“You know the education resources in the Northwest aren’t anywhere near what Columbia offers. Why the sudden interest in moving out there?”

I gave him the answer I’d stayed up all night rehearsing. “I know. But I made my desicion.”

He looked at me with something like admiration, but still hesitated. “This is a huge decision, Sierra. Maybe talk it over with your parents?”

I shook my head, polite but firm. “I’m eighteen. Legally an adult. I want to make this decision on my own. And… I’d really appreciate it if you kept this private for now. I’m not ready for anyone else to know.”

Seeing how serious I was, Mr. Carter didn’t push back. He helped me fill out the application for the early admission program at Northwest Institute of Science and submitted it through the portal right then and there.

“You better start packing,” he said. “If everything goes smoothly, you’ll be leaving by the start of next month.”

I thanked him over and over before stepping out of the office.

And walked straight into Chase.

His eyes searched mine, emotions roiling beneath the surface. “Mr. Carter said you’re leaving. What’s he talking about? Where are you going?”

I didn’t want to explain. “He just meant college is starting soon. We’ll all be heading off in different directions.”

I kept walking, but he followed, sticking to my side as we descended the stairs.

“You didn’t send me a goodnight text last night. Were you mad? I didn’t mean to ignore you at the party—it’s just, everyone was teasing me about being with Maddie. I didn’t want to embarrass her.”

He reached out, trying to ruffle my hair like he always used to.

But I stepped away.

He froze.

I looked him right in the eye. “Chase, Maddie and I are twins. Have you ever stopped to think… maybe the one you liked all along was her?”

His expression shifted. “What? No. That’s not true. If I liked Maddie, why would I date you?”

“Sierra, I’m already yours, okay? You’re not trying to back out of this, are you?”

I held his gaze, heart pounding.

But before I could say anything more, a voice called from around the corner.

“Chase!” Maddie’s sweet, sing-song tone echoed down the hallway. “Didn’t you promise to help me go over my scores?”

Chase immediately turned. “Yeah! I’m coming!”

He looked back at me, apologetic. “I told Maddie I’d help her figure out her college options. Don’t overthink it. I’ll help you after, okay?”

Then he jogged off.

I didn’t say a word.

All I could do was watch him walk away.

As he and Maddie headed off together, the underclassmen couldn’t stop whispering.

“Chase and Maddie look so cute together.”

“I thought graduation season was when couples break up, not get sweeter.”

“I heard they’re both applying to Columbia.”

“Duh, they’re totally dating. My cousin was at their grad party last night—he saw them kissing.”

The words hit me like little darts.

So… after I left, they’d gone even further.

I guess I’d made the right call choosing the early admission program.

Once I left, Chase wouldn’t have to keep pretending.

And I wouldn’t have to watch it anymore.

I headed back to the dorms to pack.

In the bottom of my desk drawer, I found my old journal. The one I hadn’t touched in months.

Page after page was filled with memories of me and Chase—dates, fights, moments that had once felt unforgettable.

I tore each page out, one by one, and dropped them into the trash.

A photo slipped loose from between the pages—Chase, mid-air during a basketball game, looking like something out of a teen sports movie.

I bent down to pick it up, but someone beat me to it.

“Whoa—aren’t Chase and Maddie a thing now?” one girl said, holding the picture up.

“Sierra, why are you hiding his photo like some stalker ex?”

Another snickered. “Guess twins really do share everything—same face, same taste in guys.”

“Seriously, get a grip,” a third girl sneered. “Fantasizing about your sister’s boyfriend? Pathetic.”

I snatched the photo back, eyes cold. “Throwing out baseless rumors isn’t just immature—it’s defamation. I don’t like Chase. And I’m not the type to cling to other people’s leftovers.”

Right in front of all of them, I ripped the photo to pieces and tossed them out the window.

I’m at the start of my espresso journey, and I have just bought a Sage Dual Bioler. I’m looking into pairing this with a good grinder, for which I am willing to invest up to around 800 USD. I have read good things about the Niche zero, but I would like to hear what are good alternatives to it, if I can buy better for my budget (or if it makes sense at all to spend more, at the start of a journey) given that the Niche Zero is now a few years old, and maybe there is something better that has come up since then.

My use case is the following:

\* I will not drink coffees other than espresso (perhaps with some excursions into mocha, but certainly not filtered coffee)

\* I will start easy (as I have to learn to grind and dial|) but want to move eventually towards medium or lighter roasts. I don’t quite know if I will ever get to try lighter roast, and maybe my being Italian will keep me towards dark or medium roasts.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **KBO Showdown: Doosan Bears vs. SSG Landers – A Same-Game Parlay Playbook**  
*Where Baseball Meets Bedlam (and a Few Stolen Bases)*

---

### 1. Parse the Odds: Numbers Don’t Lie (Mostly)

Let’s start with the cold, hard math. The **SSG Landers** are priced at **+200** (decimal: 2.0) on the moneyline, while the **Doosan Bears** are the slight favorites at **-217** (decimal: 1.83). That translates to implied probabilities of **50% for SSG** and **53% for Doosan**—a razor-thin edge for the Bears.

The spread? Doosan is giving **1.5 runs** at most books, with SSG -1.5 priced at **+260** (decimal: 2.6). For the totals, the line is **7.5 runs**, with the **over** at **-110** to **-105** and the **under** at **+105** to **+110**.

Key stats:

* **SSG’s 7-game winning streak** (including a 4-2 romp over Kiwoom) suggests they’re a well-oiled machine.
* **Doosan’s last game** was a 3-2 loss to KIA, where they scored just 2 runs—like a toaster in a bakery, as my grandma says.
* The KBO’s tie-game epidemic? Not relevant here. This matchup isn’t going to extra innings unless someone invents a time-traveling mercy rule.

---

### 2. Digest the News: Injuries, Milestones, and a Bear Named Han

* **SSG’s Han Jae-seung**, the newly traded ace, earned his first win as a Landers player in his debut. He’s like a rookie who aced his first job interview but still can’t figure out the office coffee machine.
* **Doosan’s Yang Ji-ho** hit a solo homer in their last loss, but the rest of the lineup? Quiet as a library during finals week.
* Meanwhile, **LG’s Park Hae-min** is one stolen base away from KBO history. If he achieves 450 steals, he’ll be the Usain Bolt of base-running—or a squirrel on a wheel, depending on your mood.

1meml49,https://www.reddit.com/r/NovelNexus/comments/1meml49/the_indigo_spell_by_richelle_mead/,The Indigo Spell by Richelle Mead,"THIS WASN'T THE FIRST TIME I'd been pulled out of bed for a crucial mission. It was, however, the first time I'd been subjected to such a personal line of questioning.  
  
  ""Are you a virgin?""  
  
  ""Huh?"" I rubbed my sleepy eyes, just in case this was all some sort of bizarre dream that would disappear. An urgent phone call had dragged me out of bed five minutes ago, and I was having a little trouble adjusting.  
  
  My history teacher, Ms. Terwilliger, leaned closer and repeated the question in a stage whisper: ""I said, are you a virgin?""  
  
  ""Um, yes. . . ""  
  
  I was fully awake now and glanced uneasily around my dorm's lobby, making sure no one was around to witness this crazy exchange. I didn't have to worry. Aside from a bored-looking desk attendant on the far side of the room, the lobby was empty, probably because no sane person would be up at this time of night. When Ms. Terwilliger's call had woken me, she'd demanded I meet her here for a ""life-or-death"" matter. Getting interrogated about my personal life wasn't quite what I'd expected.  
  
  She stepped back and sighed in relief. ""Yes, of course. Of course you're a virgin. ""  
  
  I narrowed my eyes, unsure if I should be offended or not. ""Of course? What's that supposed to mean? What's going on?""  
  
  She immediately snapped back to attention and pushed her wire-rimmed glasses up the bridge of her nose. They were always slipping down. ""No time to explain. We have to go. "" She grabbed hold of my arm, but I resisted and stayed where I was.  
  
  ""Ma'am, it's three in the morning!"" And then, just so she'd understand the severity of the situation: ""On a school night. ""  
  
  ""Never mind that. "" She turned in the direction of the desk attendant and called across the room, ""I'm taking Sydney Melrose with me. Mrs. Weathers can argue with me about the curfew tomorrow. ""  
  
  The attendant looked startled, but she was just some college student who'd been hired to sit there overnight. She was no match for the formidable Ms. Terwilliger, with her tall, gangly stature and birdlike face. The real authority keeping girls in my dorm was the security guard outside, but he simply nodded in a friendly way when Ms. Terwilliger dragged me past. It made me wonder just how many girls she'd abducted in the middle of the night.  
  
  ""I'm in my pajamas,"" I told her. It was the last protest I could offer as we reached her car, which was parked in a fire lane. She drove a red Volkswagen Beetle with flowers painted on the sides. Somehow, this didn't surprise me in the least.  
  
  ""You'll be fine,"" she said, fishing car keys out of her massive velvet purse.  
  
  Around us, the desert night was cool and silent. Tall palm trees created dark, spiderlike shapes against the sky. Beyond them, a full moon and smattering of stars glittered. I wrapped my arms around myself, touching the soft fabric of my microfleece robe. Underneath it, I had on full-length striped pajamas paired with fluffy beige slippers. The ensemble worked well in my cozy dorm room but wasn't exactly practical for a Palm Springs night. But then, going out in pajamas wasn't really practical in any place.  
  
  She unlocked the car, and I stepped gingerly inside, having to dodge empty paper coffee cups and old issues of Utne Reader. My neat sensibilities cringed at that kind of mess, but it was the least of my worries right now.  
  
  ""Ms. Terwilliger,"" I said, once we were driving through the suburban streets. ""What's going on?"" Now that we were out of the dorm, I hoped she'd start talking sense. I hadn't forgotten her ""life-or-death"" comment and was beginning to grow nervous.  
  
  Her eyes were on the road ahead of us, and lines of worry marked her angular face. ""I need you to cast a spell. ""  
  
  I froze as I tried to process her words. Not long ago, this proclamation would've sent me into protests and fits of revulsion. Not that I was comfortable with it now. Magic still freaked me out. Ms. Terwilliger taught at my private high school, Amberwood Prep, by day and was a witch at night. She said I, too, possessed a natural affinity for magic and had managed to teach me some spells, despite my best efforts to resist. I actually had a few good reasons for wanting to avoid anything arcane. Aside from inborn beliefs about magic being wrong, I simply didn't want to get caught up in any more supernatural affairs than I had to. I already spent my days as part of a secret society that kept vampires secret from the human world. That and my schoolwork were enough to keep anyone busy.  
  
  Nonetheless, her magical training had gotten me out of some dangerous situations recently, and I was no longer so quick to dismiss it. So, her suggesting I perform magic wasn't the weirdest thing going on here.  
  
  ""Why would you need me for that?"" I asked. There were few cars out, but occasionally, passing headlights would cast a ghostly light over us. ""You're a million times more powerful. I can't cast a fraction of the things you can. ""  
  
  ""Power is one thing,"" she admitted. ""But there are other limitations and factors at work here. I can't cast this particular spell. ""  
  
  I crossed my arms and slouched back in the seat. If I kept focusing on the practical aspects, I could ignore how worried I was growing. ""And it couldn't have waited until morning?""  
  
  ""No,"" she said gravely. ""It could not. ""  
  
  Something about the tone of her voice sent chills down my spine, and I fell silent as we continued our drive. We were headed outside of the city and suburbs, into the wilds of the true desert. The farther we drove from civilization, the darker it became. Once we were off the freeway, there were no streetlights or houses in sight. Spiky desert shrubs created dark shapes along the side of the road that put me in mind of crouching animals, ready to pounce. There's no one out here, I thought. And no one back at Amberwood knows you're here either.  
  
  I shifted uneasily as I recalled her virgin question. Was I going to be a sacrifice in some unholy ritual? I wished that I'd thought to bring my cell phone - not that I could have told my organization, the Alchemists, that I was spending so much time with a magic user. And not just any magic user - one who was teaching me to become one too. Better to risk being sacrificed than face the Alchemists' wrath.  
  
  Twenty minutes later, Ms. Terwilliger finally pulled to a stop along the side of a dusty one-lane road that seemed to be a direct route to nowhere. She got out of the car and motioned for me to do the same. It was colder here than it had been back at Amberwood. Looking up into the night sky, I caught my breath. Free of the city lights, the stars were now out in full force. I could see the Milky Way and a dozen constellations usually hidden to the naked eye.  
  
  ""Stargaze later,"" she said curtly. ""We need to hurry, before the moon progresses much further. ""  
  
  A moonlight ritual, a barren desert, virgin sacrifice . . . what had I just foolishly walked into? The way Ms. Terwilliger pushed me into magic always annoyed me, but I never thought she posed a threat. Now I berated myself for being so naive.  
  
  She tossed a duffel bag over one shoulder and headed off into a desolate stretch of land, dotted with rocks and scraggly vegetation. Even with the brilliant celestial display there wasn't much light out here, yet she walked purposefully, as though she knew exactly where she was going. I dutifully followed, wincing as I crossed the rocky ground. My fuzzy slippers had never been intended for this sort of terrain.  
  
  ""Here,"" she said when we reached a small clearing. She carefully set down the duffel bag and knelt to rifle through it. ""This'll do. ""  
  
  The desert that was so mercilessly hot in the day became cold at night, but I was still sweating. Probably my own anxiety had more to do with that than the temperature or heavy pajamas. I retied my robe more tightly making a perfect knot. I found that kind of detail and routine soothing.  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger produced a large oval mirror with a scalloped silver frame. She set it down in the middle of the clearing, glanced up at the sky, and then shifted the mirror  
over a little. ""Come here, Miss Melbourne. "" She pointed to a spot opposite her, on the other side of the mirror. ""Sit there and make yourself comfortable. ""  
  
  At Amberwood, I went by the name of Sydney Melrose, rather than my true one, Sydney Sage. Ms. Terwilliger had gotten my made-up name wrong on the first day of class, and it, unfortunately, stuck. I followed her directions, not that I could really get all that comfortable out here. I was pretty sure I could hear some large animal scuffling out in the brush and added ""coyotes"" to my mental list of dangers I faced out here, right below ""magic use"" and ""lack of coffee. ""  
  
  ""Now then. Let's get started. "" Ms. Terwilliger peered at me with eyes that were dark and frightening in the desert night. ""Are you wearing anything metal? You need to take it off. ""  
  
  ""No, I - oh. Wait. ""  
  
  I reached around my neck and unfastened a delicate gold chain that held a small cross. I'd had the necklace for years but had recently given it to someone else, for comfort. He'd given it back to me recently, by way of our mutual friend Jill Mastrano Dragomir. Even now, I could picture the angry look on her face as she'd stormed up to me at school and thrust the cross into my hand without a word.  
  
  I stared at the cross now as it gleamed in the moonlight. A queasy feeling welled up in the pit of my stomach as I thought about Adrian, the guy I'd given it to. I'd done so before he professed his love for me, something that had caught me totally off guard a few weeks ago. But maybe I shouldn't have been so surprised. The more I looked back - and I did so all the time - the more I began to recall telltale signs that should have tipped me off to his feelings. I'd just been too blind to notice at the time.  
  
  Of course, it wouldn't have mattered if I'd seen it coming or not. Adrian was totally unsuitable for me, and it had nothing to do with his many vices or potential descent into insanity. Adrian was a vampire. True, he was a Moroi - one of the good, living vampires - but it made no difference. Humans and vampires couldn't be together. This was one point the Moroi and Alchemists stood firmly together on. It was still amazing to me that Adrian had voiced those feelings to me. It was amazing that he could even have them or that he'd had the nerve to kiss me, even if it was a kiss that had left me dizzy and breathless.  
  
  I'd had to reject him, of course. My training would allow nothing less. Our situation here in Palm Springs forced the two of us to constantly be together in social situations, and it had been rough since his declaration. For me, it wasn't just the awkwardness of our new relationship. I . . . well, I missed him. Before this debacle, he and I had been friends and spent a lot of time together. I'd gotten used to his smirky smile and the quick banter that always flowed between us. Until those things were gone, I hadn't realized how much I relied on them. How much I needed them. I felt empty inside . . . which was ridiculous, of course. Why should I care so much about one vampire?  
  
  Sometimes it made me angry. Why had he ruined such a good thing between us? Why had he made me miss him so much? And what had he expected me to do? He had to have known it was impossible for us to be together. I couldn't have feelings for him. I couldn't. If we'd lived among the Keepers - a group of uncivilized vampires, humans, and dhampirs - maybe he and I could have . . . no. Even if I had feelings for him - and I firmly told myself I didn't - it was wrong for us to even consider such a relationship.  
  
  Now Adrian spoke to me as little as possible. And always, always, he watched me with a haunted look in his green eyes, one that made my heart ache and -  
  
  ""Ah! What is that?""  
  
  I squirmed as Ms. Terwilliger dumped a bowl full of dried leaves and flowers over my head. I'd been so fixated on the cross and my memories that I hadn't seen her coming.  
  
  ""Rosemary,"" she said matter-of-factly ""Hyssop. Anise. Don't do that. "" I'd reached up to pull some of the leaves out of my hair. ""You need that for the spell. ""  
  
  ""Right,"" I said, getting back to business. I set the cross carefully on the ground, trying to clear my mind of green, green eyes. ""The spell that only I can do. Why is that again?""  
  
  ""Because it has to be done by a virgin,"" she explained. I tried not to grimace. Her words implied that she was not a virgin, and even if that made sense for a forty-year-old woman, it still wasn't a thought I wanted to spend a lot of time on. ""That, and the person we're looking for has shielded herself from me. But you? You she won't expect. ""  
  
  I looked down at the shining mirror and understood. ""This is a scrying spell. Why aren't we doing the one I did before?""  
  
  Not that I was eager to repeat that spell. I'd used it to find someone, and it had involved me staring into a bowl of water for hours. Still, now that I knew how to do it, I knew I could perform it again. Besides, I didn't like the idea of walking into a spell I knew nothing about. Words and herbs were one thing, but what else might she ask of me? Endanger my soul? Give up my blood?  
  
  ""That spell only works for someone you know,"" she explained. ""This one will help you find someone you've never met before. ""  
  
  I frowned. As much as I didn't like magic, I did like problem solving - and the puzzles magic often presented intrigued me. ""How will I know who to look for, then?""  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger handed me a photograph. My eyes had adjusted to the darkness, and I looked into the face of a pretty young woman. There was a striking resemblance between her and my teacher, though it wasn't initially obvious. Rather than Ms. Terwilliger's dull brown hair, this woman's was dark, nearly black. She was also much more glamorous, dressed in a black satin evening gown that was a far cry from Ms. Terwilliger's usual hippie attire. Despite those ostensible differences, the two women shared the same high cheekbones and aquiline eyes.  
  
  I glanced back up. ""She's related to you. ""  
  
  ""She's my older sister,"" Ms. Terwilliger confirmed, her voice remarkably flat. Older? I would've guessed this woman was at least ten years younger.  
  
  ""Is she missing?"" I asked. When I'd scried before, it had been to find a kidnapped friend.  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger's lips twitched. ""Not in the way you're thinking. "" From the never-ending duffel bag, she produced a small leather book and opened it to a marked page. Squinting at where she indicated, I could make out handwritten Latin words describing the mirror and herbal concoction she'd dumped on me. Following that were directions on how to use the spell. No bloodletting, thankfully.  
  
  ""It sounds too simple,"" I said suspiciously. I'd learned that spells that only had a few steps and components usually required a lot of mental energy. I'd passed out from the other scrying spell.  
  
  She nodded, guessing my thoughts. ""It takes a lot of focus - more than the last one. But, as much as you don't want to hear this, your strength has grown enough that you'll probably have an easier time than before. ""  
  
  I scowled. She was right. I didn't want to hear that.  
  
  Or did I?  
  
  Part of me knew I should refuse to go along with this madness. Another part of me worried she'd abandon me in the desert if I didn't help. And still another part was insanely curious to see how this would all work.  
  
  Taking a deep breath, I recited the book's incantation and then set the picture in the middle of the mirror. I repeated the incantation and removed the picture. Leaning forward, I stared into the shining surface, trying to clear my mind and let myself become one with the darkness and moonlight. A hum of energy coursed through me, much more quickly than I expected. Nothing changed in the mirror right away, though. Only my reflection peered back at me, the poor lighting dulling my blond hair, which looked terrible both from sleeping on it and having a bunch of dried plants hanging in its strands.  
  
  The energy continued to build in me, growing surprisingly warm and exhilarating. I closed my eyes and sank into it. I felt like I was floating in the moonlight, like I was the moonlight. I could've stayed that way forever.  
  
  ""Do you see anything?""  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger's voice was an unwelcome interruption to my blissful state, but I obediently opened my eyes and looked into the mirror. My reflection was gone. A silvery gray mist hung in front  
of a building, but I knew the mist wasn't physical. It was magically produced, a mental barrier to keep me from seeing the image that lay beyond it. Strengthening my will, I pushed my mind passed that barrier, and after a few moments, the mist shattered.  
  
  ""I see a building. "" My voice echoed oddly in the night. ""An old Victorian house. Dark red, with a traditional covered porch. There are hydrangea bushes in front of it. There's a sign too, but I can't read it. ""  
  
  ""Can you tell where the house is?"" My teacher's voice seemed very far away. ""Look around it. ""  
  
  I tried to pull back, to extend my vision beyond the house. It took a few moments, but slowly, the image panned out as though I were watching a movie, revealing a neighborhood of similar houses, all Victorian with wide porches and creeping vines. They were a beautiful, perfect piece of history set in the modern world.  
  
  ""Nothing exact,"" I told her. ""Just some quaint residential street. ""  
  
  ""Go back further. See the larger picture. ""  
  
  I did, and it was like I drifted up into the sky, looking down upon the neighborhood the way some soaring bird would. The houses extended into more neighborhoods, which eventually gave way to industrial and commercial areas. I continued moving back. The businesses became more and more densely packed. More streets crisscrossed between them. The buildings grew taller and taller, eventually materializing into a familiar skyline.  
  
  ""Los Angeles,"" I said. ""The house is on the outskirts of Los Angeles. ""  
  
  I heard a sharp intake of breath, followed by: ""Thank you, Miss Melbourne. That will be all. ""  
  
  A hand suddenly waved across my field of vision, shattering the city image. Also shattered was that state of euphoria. I was no longer floating, no longer made of light. I came crashing down to reality, down to the rocky desert landscape and my stuffy pajamas. I felt exhausted and shaky, like I might faint. Ms. Terwilliger handed me a thermos full of orange juice, which I drank greedily. As the nutrients hit my system and strengthened me, I began to feel a little better. Intense magic use depleted blood sugar.  
  
  ""Does that help?"" I asked, once I'd downed the thermos. A nagging voice inside me started to chastise about how many calories were in orange juice, but I ignored it. ""Was that what you wanted to know?""  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger gave me a smile that didn't extend to her eyes. ""It helps, yes. Was it what I wanted?"" She stared off into the distance. ""No, not exactly. I was hoping you'd name some other city. Some city far, far away. ""  
  
  I picked up my cross and refastened it around my neck. The familiar object brought on a sense of normality after what I'd just done. It also made me feel guilty, looking back on the euphoric high the magic had given me. Humans weren't supposed to wield magic - and they certainly weren't supposed to enjoy it. Running my fingers over the cross's surface, I found myself thinking of Adrian again. Had he ever worn it? Or had he just kept it around for luck? Had his fingers traced the cross's shape like mine often did?  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger began gathering her things. When she stood up, I followed suit. ""What does it mean exactly, ma'am?"" I asked. ""That I saw Los Angeles?""  
  
  I followed her back toward the car, and she didn't answer right away. When she did, her voice was uncharacteristically grim. ""It means that she's much closer than I would like. It also means, whether you want to or not, you're going to have to work on improving your magical skills very, very quickly. ""  
  
  I came to a halt. Suddenly, I felt angry. Enough was enough. I was exhausted and ached all over. She'd dragged me out here in the middle of the night and now had the presumption to make a statement like that when she knew how I felt about magic? Worse, her words frightened me. What did I have to do with this? This was her spell, her cause. Yet, she'd given the directive with such force, such certainty, that it almost seemed as though I was the reason we'd come out here to this wasteland.  
  
  ""Ma'am - "" I began.  
  
  Ms. Terwilliger spun around and leaned toward me so that there were only a few inches between us. I gulped, swallowing whatever outraged words I'd been about to utter. I'd never seen her look like this. She wasn't scary, not exactly, but there was an intensity I'd never seen before, far different from the usual scattered teacher I knew. She also looked . . . frightened. Life or death.  
  
  ""Sydney,"" she said, in a rare use of my first name. ""Let me assure you that this is not some trick on my part. You will improve upon your skills, whether you like it or not. And it's not because I'm cruel, not because I'm trying to fulfill some selfish desire. It's not even because I hate seeing you waste your ability. ""  
  
  ""Then why?"" I asked in a small voice. ""Why do I need to learn more?""  
  
  The wind whispered around us, blowing some of the dried leaves and flowers from my hair. The shadows we cast took on an ominous feel, and the moonlight and starlight that had seemed so divine earlier now felt cold and harsh.  
  
  ""Because,"" Ms. Terwilliger said. ""It's for your own protection. 

Chapter Two  
  
   
  
  MS. TERWILLIGER REFUSED to say much more after that. She drove us back to Amberwood and hardly seemed to know I was there. She just kept muttering things to herself like, ""Not enough time"" and ""Need more proof. "" When she finally dropped me off, I tried pressing her for more information.  
  
  ""What was all that about protecting myself?"" I asked. ""Protection from what?""  
  
  We were parked in the fire lane again, and she still wore that distracted look. ""I'll explain later, in our session tomorrow. ""  
  
  ""I can't,"" I reminded her. ""I'm leaving right after my regular classes. Remember? I have a flight to catch. I told you about it last week. And yesterday. And earlier today. ""  
  
  That brought her back to attention. ""Did you? Well, then. I suppose we'll make do with what we must. I'll see what I can have for you in the morning. ""  
  
  I left her for my bed after that, not that I could get much sleep. And when I showed up to her history class the next morning, she was true to her word. Before the bell rang, she walked up to my desk and handed me an old book with a cracked red leather cover. The title was in Latin and translated to Elements of Battle, which sent a chill down my spine. Spells to create light and invisibility were one thing. There was a practicality to them that I could almost rationalize. But battle spells? Something told me I might have a little trouble with those.  
  
  ""Reading material for the plane,"" she said. She spoke in her usual, addled scholar voice, but I could see a glint of that anxiety from last night in her eyes. ""Focus only on the first section. I trust you'll do your usual thorough job - and then some. ""  
  
  None of the other arriving students paid any attention to us. My last class of the day was an independent study session on late-antique history, which she served as my mentor for. More often than not, she used the session as a passive-aggressive way to teach me magic. So, her giving me books like this was nothing out of the ordinary.  
  
  ""And,"" she added, ""if you could find out where that neighborhood is, it would be extremely useful. ""  
  
  I was speechless for a few moments. Locate one neighborhood in the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area? ""That's . . . a very large area to cover,"" I said at last, choosing my words carefully with witnesses around.  
  
  She nodded and pushed her glasses up her nose. ""I know. Most people probably couldn't do it. "" And on that semi-complimentary note, she returned to her desk at the front of the classroom.  
  
  ""What neighborhood?"" asked a new voice.  
  
  Eddie Castile had just arrived and slid into a neighboring desk. Eddie was a dhampir - possessing a mix of human and vampire DNA that had been passed down from days when the two races mixed. For all intents and purposes, though, he was indistinguishable from an ordinary human. With his sandy-colored hair and brown eyes, he also bore enough resemblance to me to support our cover story that we were twins. In reality, Eddie was here at Amberwood as a bodyguard for Jill. Dissidents among her own kind, the Moroi, were hunting her, and even though we'd seen no sign of them since coming to Palm Springs, Eddie was always vigilant and ready to pounce.  
  
  I slipped the red leather book into my messenger bag. ""Don't ask. Another of her wacky assignments. "" None of my friends - save Adrian - knew about my involvement with Ms. Terwilliger's magic use. Well, and Jill by default. All Moroi possessed some sort of elemental magic. Adrian's was a rare and powerful one called spirit, which could work miracles of healing. He'd used that magic to bring Jill back from the dead when assassins had killed her. Doing so had made Jill ""shadow-kissed"" - that is, it created a psychic bond between them, one that allowed Jill to feel his emotions and sometimes see through his eyes. As a result, Jill knew more about what went on between Adrian and me than I liked.  
  
  I took my car keys out of my bag and reluctantly handed them over to Eddie. He was the only one I trusted to drive my car, and I always let him borrow it when I left town, in case he needed to run errands for our group. ""Here you go. I better get it back in one piece. Do not let Angeline near the driver's seat. ""  
  
  He grinned. ""Do I look suicidal? I probably won't even use it. Are you sure you don't want me to drive you to the airport later?""  
  
  ""You'd miss class,"" I said. The only reason I was able to cut school early was because of the unusual nature of my independent study.  
  
  ""I wouldn't mind, believe me. I've got a science test. "" He grimaced and lowered his voice. ""I hated physics the first time, you know. ""  
  
  I couldn't help a smile. Both Eddie and I were eighteen and had graduated high school, me through homeschooling and him through an elite Moroi and dhampir academy. We couldn't pose as students without going through the motions of class, however. While I didn't mind the extra work, Eddie wasn't as taken with a love of learning as I was.  
  
  ""No thanks,"" I told him. ""A cab will be fine. ""  
  
  The bell rang, and Eddie straightened up in his desk. As Ms. Terwilliger called the class to order, he whispered to me, ""Jill's really bummed she can't go. ""  
  
  ""I know,"" I murmured back. ""But we all know why she can't. ""  
  
  ""Yeah,"" he agreed. ""What I don't know is why she's mad at you. ""  
  
  I turned toward the front of the classroom and pointedly ignored him. Jill was the only one who knew about Adrian's declaration of love, thanks to that bond. It was another one of those things I wished hadn't been shared, but Adrian couldn't help it. Although Jill knew vampire-human romances were wrong, she couldn't forgive me for hurting Adrian so badly. To make things worse, she was probably personally experiencing some of his pain.  
  
  Even if our other friends didn't know what had occurred, it was obvious that something wasn't right with Jill and me. Eddie had picked up on it right away and immediately interrogated me. I'd given him a vague excuse about Jill not liking some rules I'd instated for her here at school. Eddie hadn't bought that, but Jill had been just as close-mouthed on the matter, leaving him clueless and frustrated.  
  
  The school day zipped by, and before long, I was in a taxi and on my way to the airport. I'd packed light and only had one small suitcase and my messenger bag, both of which could be carried on. For what seemed like the hundredth time, I took out a small silver and white gift bag and examined its contents. Inside was an expensive crystal sun catcher, the kind meant to be hung on a porch or in a window. It depicted two doves in flight, facing each other. Wrapping it back in its tissue paper, I returned it to its gift bag and then my own bag. I hoped it would be an acceptable gift for the upcoming event.  
  
  I was going to a vampire wedding.  
  
  I'd never been to one before. Probably no Alchemist had. Although we worked with the Moroi to protect their existence, the Alchemists made it clear they wanted no involvement that went beyond business contact. After recent events, however, both groups had decided it would be good to improve our professional relations. Since this wedding was a big deal, a few other Alchemists and I had been invited.  
  
  I knew the couple, and in theory, I was excited to see them married. It was the rest of the event that made me nervous: a huge social gathering of Moroi and dhampirs. Even with other Alchemists there, we'd be hopelessly outnumbered. Being in Palm Springs with Eddie, Jill, and the others had gone a long way in improving my feelings toward their kind. I got along with that little group well and now considered them friends. But even as liberal as I was in such matters, I still possessed a lot of the anxiety other Alchemists had inside the vampiric world. Maybe Moroi and dhampirs weren't creatures of evil, like I'd once believed, but they certainly weren't human.  
  
  I kind of wished my Palm Springs friends were coming with me, but that had been out of the question. The whole point of Jill and the rest of us being in Palm Springs was to hide her away and keep her safe from those trying to kill her. Both Moroi and Strigoi tended to avoid sunny, desert regions. If she suddenly showed up at a major Moroi function, it would defeat the whole purpose. Eddie and Angeline, another dhampir protecting her at Amberwood, had to stay behind as well. Only Adrian and I had been invited to the wedding, and we wer  
e thankfully on separate flights. If anyone had noticed that he and I were traveling together, it could attract attention back in Palm Springs, which could then expose Jill. Adrian's flight wasn't even leaving from Palm Springs. He was flying out by way of Los Angeles, two hours west, just to make sure we weren't linked together.  
  
  I had to connect through a different flight in Los Angeles, which reminded me of Ms. Terwilliger's task. Find one neighborhood in all of Los Angeles's greater metropolitan area. Sure, no problem. The only thing I had going for me was that the Victorian houses were so distinct. If I could find some historical society, there was a good chance they could direct me toward areas matching that description. It would narrow my search considerably.  
  
  I reached my gate at LAX an hour before the scheduled flight. I'd just gotten cozy with Ms. Terwilliger's book when an overhead announcement declared, ""Paging passenger Melrose. Please come see a customer service agent. ""  
  
  I felt a sinking feeling in the pit of my stomach. Gathering up my things, I approached the desk and was greeted by a cheery airline representative.  
  
  ""I'm sad to tell you this flight has been overbooked,"" she said. From her peppy voice and big smile, she didn't seem sad at all.  
  
  ""What's that mean for me, exactly?"" I asked, my dread growing. ""I have a confirmed seat. "" I dealt with bureaucracy and red tape all the time, but overbooking flights was something I'd never understood. How did that even happen? It wasn't like the number of seats was a surprise to them.  
  
  ""It means that you're no longer on the flight,"" she explained. ""You and a couple other volunteers gave up your seats to accommodate that family. Otherwise, they would've had to be split up. ""  
  
  ""Volunteers?"" I repeated, following her gesture. Off to the side of the seating area, a family with seven children smiled back at me. The children were tiny and adorable, with big eyes and the kind of cuteness you saw in musicals about orphans finding new homes. Outraged, I turned back toward the agent. ""How can you do that? I checked in way ahead of time! I have a wedding to get to. I can't miss it. ""  
  
  The woman produced a boarding pass. ""We've more than made up for it. We've booked you on another flight, to Philadelphia - one that's leaving sooner. And you've even been upgraded to first class for your inconvenience. ""  
  
  ""That's something,"" I said. I was still annoyed at this, simply out of principle. I liked order and procedure. Altering those threw off my world. I looked down at the boarding pass and then did a double take. ""It's leaving now!""  
  
  She nodded. ""Like I said, sooner. I'd hurry up if I were you. ""  
  
  Then, on cue, I heard a last-call announcement for my new flight, saying all passengers need to be on board now, as they were about to shut the cabin doors. I wasn't the swearing type, but I almost was then - especially when I saw that my new gate was on the opposite side of the terminal. Without another word, I grabbed my things and sprinted toward the gate as quickly as I could, making a mental note to write a letter of complaint to the airline. Through some miracle, I made it just before my new flight was closed to passengers, though the agent working that gate sternly told me that next time, I should plan ahead and allow more time.

Even the infection I had, while painful for a few days, was very manageable and just a reminder to baby my scars a little more. I’m a little nervous about people’s reactions once I start school especially because teenage girls can be bitchy so any advice on that would be greatly appreciated.

**My [25F] boyfriend [26M] of 1 year just told me that he wants me to pay him a rental fee for borrowing his car to visit my family. Am I wrong to be upset?**

[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/s/Ctm4nn4wex) **Nov 27, 2015**

Ordinarily this wouldn't be a problem. I would just take my car, but it is being fixed right now. This meant that in order for me to drive to see my family for Thanksgiving I would have to either rent a car or borrow someone's. Since my boyfriend was flying out to California for Thanksgiving and wouldn't be using his, I asked him if he would mind if I borrowed it. He told me that of course I could borrow his car. 

Nothing else was said about it until today (other than some minor things). I texted him to thank him again for helping me. The way I worded things apparently made it clear to him that I was only planning to cover the gas I used, and he told me that he expected me to pay him a ""reasonable"" fee for using the car. Reasonable to him is $50 a day plus replacing the gas I use (so the visit will cost me at least $250 in addition to whatever the gas costs). 

It is his car, so I don't think I can really argue with him about this. I do understand in principal. I don't think being his girlfriend entitles me to use his stuff whenever I want, but I am hurt that he is being so stingy. We've been together for a year; it's the holidays; and my only other option was renting a car through a private company. I guess I would have hoped that he would have been more sympathetic, but maybe he has a right to expect that he be paid for use of his car. I don't know. I very rarely ask him for any favors and cover all of my expenses myself, so he can't say that I am using him or exploiting him financially. This has never come up before, so I have been taken off guard. Maybe I am being too sensitive?  

EDIT: Just so you guys know, I am already at my family's house. Sorry if that wasn't clear. 

   
**tl;dr**: I had to borrow my boyfriend's car to visit my family. He wants me to pay him $50 per day for use of it. I am upset by this, but I think that maybe I am just being too sensitive. 

**RELEVANT COMMENTS**

**lonnielee3**

>If he said you could ""borrow"" his car and now he's saying you can ""rent"" his car, he's changing the deal midstream and it's sorta weird.  Personally, I'd conclude he doesn't really want me to use his car for that period of time and I'd rent one from a private company. He should have just told you upfront he didn't want you to use his car.

**OOP**

>>I even checked with him a few times to make sure it was fine. At no point did he mention that he wanted me to pay him.

**~**

**banana-skin**

>That seems ridiculous IMO, and I would be pissed if someone asked the same of me... well, if my significant other or a close friend asked it. 

>I don't really get his motive - is he trying to make money off his girlfriend just because he could? I don't see why, if you're paying for gas (and obviously covering anything else that you personally *do* to the car, like if God forbid you got into an accident or spilled coffee on the seats or something), he needs some kind of additional fee. 

>Your relationship isn't a business. This situation seems like some bullshit. You could try talking more to him about it, or you could refuse to pay the fee (""I thought you were joking!""), or you could rent from an actual company and incur costs but avoid this weird power play... 

**OOP**

>>He's not one to joke, so I have no doubt he really is being serious. I would be interested to know why he wants me to pay. I'm not sure what he really gains unless he thinks this will discourage me from borrowing his property. 

**banana-skin**

>>>Maybe if you've lost/damaged his property before or are irresponsible with stuff...? I don't mean any offense to you, but that's the only thing I can think of without knowing more details. He sounds like a tool.

**OOP**

>>>>Nothing like that has happened before. 

**when asked if her bf makes other demands**

>If we do go out, we usually have to plan it around his sport teams' schedule. He also refuses to do anything that he thinks is a ""waste of money."" No vacations, movie dates, bowling, etc.

Hey, everyone. I know a lot of you have been wanting an update. I meant to post one way a few days ago, but things have been really busy lately.

I didn't want to ruin my Thanksgiving holiday thinking about the car situation, so I decided to wait until I got back to discuss it with my boyfriend. I was really hoping that this was all just a misunderstanding, but unfortunately it was not. 

When I brought up the rental payment, my boyfriend said that he thought it was only fair that I compensate him for the use of his car. He asked me if I had a problem with that, and I told him that I did. I mentioned what some of you said about how I could have rented a car for less if I had known he was going to charge me. I also told him how I felt like he had taken advantage of me by only mentioning the fee after I had taken his car. 

One thing that one of you mentioned was that maybe someone had suggested it to him. I asked him about that, and he said that no one had said anything. He just figured that it would only be fair for me to pay for the use of his car. I did at least get him to see that the price he charged me was too high, but he didn't think he was wrong about the fee. We ended up having a larger conversation about how tight he is with money and some other things I mentioned in my first post. I didn't intend to break up with him, but after he still insisted on the rental payment, I just realized that he was not someone I wanted to be with. I did end up paying him, but it was $100 instead of $250.

So that's the update. He has apologized and asked me to take him back, but I don't think I'm interested anymore. Thanks for your help everyone. 

   
**tl;dr**: Boyfriend was serious when he requested I pay him a rental fee for his car. We broke up. 

**FINAL COMMENTS**

**OOP explains her ex being tight with money**

>Nothing to a point. I am perfectly able to (and always have) split everything with him, but even if I pay my way, he still would refuse to do almost anything that costed money. I don't need to always go out and do things, but even 3-4 times a month was too much. We're not even talking about a nice restaurant or an expensive trip; we're talking can't go to Chili's or go bowling because it's too ""expensive"".

Because of this she told me in February I will pay more of the bills than you se we each have the same amount of money left over every month perfect. So what's the issue? She is HORRIBLE at money management. I'll go over what happened this month for example she gets paid 1068 weekly I make (with my new job $4hr raise from my previous job) 1250 bi weekly she paid 550for car in the first half of the month then at the end of the month she needs to 380 for her car (I pay the 2nd payment of my car at the 2nd half it's a odd situation) and 1500 for rentand groceries. I pay phones (including hers and my sisters), GE, Internet, 2nd 550 to my car, car insurance for both cars. 

I paid for my things in the first half and only needed to pay 550+car ins I asked her for her 380 so I can pay her car(it's on my name) she said ""I don't have it because I went shopping for cloth and went out and did stuff. Then she said ""oh yea and I need your help with rent."" I told her I do t have that kind of money I have my own stuff to pay. I know from talking to her that I spent 400 in 2 weeks on just living (coffee/breakfast at dunks, sometimes food for work (mostly meal prep every once and a while I get DoorDash, Gas ECT.) she got PISSED that I spent that much in 2 weeks. She has spent 1700$ in a week and a half on who knows what because she refuses to tell me and then gets mad at ME. And this is the loop. 

It's not like I can't cover for her either because that means rent doesn't get paid or cars don't get paid ECT. I have 2 cats too so I can't just up and go and my credit isn't great right now (trying to fix that) and I can't exactly save up to move out either because of this. Any suggestions?

I’ve been a long time lurker on the sub and figured you would enjoy this story. I’ll try to keep it as PG as possible.

Buckle up because this is a long one

In January of 2024 I (21F) came home to my parents house after work. When I walked in, my mom (54F) was sitting in the kitchen excited and called me over to talk with her. She told me that she made friends with the guy who worked on her car (we’ll call him Bob) and that they got to talking about their kids. Bob told my mom about his son who is kind, sweet, and overall just a great guy. He showed her pictures and she said he was super cute and tall and that I would like him. They showed him a photo of me and he called me cute too! So obviously I wanted to see what he looked like but she didn’t have a photo. All she knew was where he worked and that he was a sweet kid who had his life together. Finally a guy who has his own house, car, and job… honestly it was refreshing lol. After hearing all of that I started getting really excited too and wanted to meet him.

So I said screw it and after drinking two cups of coffee that day I had some major caffeinated confidence that I never had before and decided to go meet him. Long story short I showed up at his job, introduced myself, and asked him if he wanted to take me out on a date. He said yes and we started planning. For the remainder of this post we’ll call him Adam (27m). Adam and I got along really well and started dating (still dating as of today 2025!). The day after our first date he gave me a key to his place and I was moved in by week 2. I know, I know, it was very fast but we had a connection like no other. Neither of us had ever felt this way before and it was genuinely like love at first sight. I always thought they exaggerated it in the movies but it felt so real experiencing it myself. We’ve had our ups and down but he truly still feels like the one.

Fast forward to April 2024, Adam and I were on a date at a cuter little ramen joint. There were two couples sitting next to us getting really drunk and of course Adam and I started lowkey listening to the conversation as one does… Anyway, after hearing a few key words, I whispered to Adam “How much you wanna bet they’re swingers?” He chuckled and I leaned in again and asked “Can I tell you something?” He looked intrigued and said yes. I told him that I’ve never told anyone this before and that he can’t tell anyone but I wanted to talk about it. I told him that I found out last year that my parents are swingers/in an open relationship. Then I was about to go on to tell him how I found out and vent a little, but then I looked up at his face and stopped. He put his hand to his forehead and sighed in what I couldn’t tell was relief or pain. I quickly said “oh don’t worry! I made sure to ask my mom if she met your dad in that community and she assured me that they didn’t so you don't have to worry about that!”

He looked at me with the saddest, most worried facial expression and told me he had something to tell me too. He said that he met my mom last year, a month before he met me because she was coming over to sleep with his dad. That they had been in a sexual relationship since then and still are. They told him before we went out on our first date to lie to me and tell me that they met each other when Bob fixed my moms car. They continued to tell him this in the 3 months we were dating at the time. That if he told me the truth, I would break up with him immediately. For context, I told my mom when I found out about her and my dads relationship that I didn’t want it to bleed over into my personal life. Basically I didn’t care what they did in their relationship as long as it didn’t affect me. So throughout our short relationship at the time, he was constantly conflicted. He said that he hated keeping it from me and that he only did it because he was scared that I would leave him but that now it was brought up, he had to tell me no matter what. He said one of the main reasons he didn’t before this was also because of the way I talked about my parents. I always praised them and their relationship, they're good parents and I love them, so he was under the assumption that I didn’t know they were open. He was afraid of crushing my image of them and not only me leaving him, but ruining my relationship with them. 

I was PISSED… to say the least. She PROMISED me that they didn’t sleep together and that they were just friends. Not only that but Adam told me she would come over while I was working the night shift and sneak out before I came home. They had loud kinky sex in Adam's house (Bob was staying with him) while Adam was there. They did this at least once a week and pretty much rubbed it in his face. Why didn't he tell them to stop, you may ask? He says he just wanted to stay out of it and most of the time they were mid doin it when he got home… not much he could do there. On top of that, he was scared to have sex with me at first because he was afraid I would sound like my mom… gross. Thankful he says I do not lol

We left the restaurant so I could calm down and register everything he had just told me. He tried to take my phone away from me so I wouldn’t say anything I would regret to my mom buttt he was unsuccessful. I called my mom on the hour-long drive home and cursed her out for lying to me, making my boyfriend lie to me/threatening him by saying I would break up with him, and for sneaking around/shoving their sex in his face. She was NOT apologetic at all and pretty much said that she was their first, she's the adult, and she can do whatever she wants.

After we calmed down she said that, and I quote,

“If I had been honest, it might have shut the door of opportunity for you and Adam to have what you have now. I felt horrible about putting Adam in that position and I knew that if you guys got really close it would come out because I wouldn’t have been able to hold it in either. I’ve thought about it many times and I couldn’t tell you because first I know you don’t want to know about this stuff and second, it’s complicated grown up shit and honestly some of it is embarrassing.”

I forgave her after we talked in person but told her to stop having sex with him. She promised me she would stop, we hugged it out, and moved on. 

For a year everything was fine until Adam and I were laying in bed and he got a text from his dad. It was a long paragraph about how horrible my mother is, that she's a drug addict, abusive, etc. and that he needed to break up with me so that he (Bob) doesn’t have to deal with her anymore. We were VERY confused but he would not elaborate. Just that they were at Bob's house and something went down. 

I went to see my mom the next day and long story short they were sleeping together again and got into a fight over us. Of course there was a screaming match between us and I told her she broke my trust. I can’t trust her anymore because she broke a promise and pushed a bounty too far. It’s not too much to ask for your mom not to have sex with your boyfriend's dad, right? Well apparently to her it was. 

Although I was really mad at the time, I was also glad that this happened. This meant that they wouldn’t talk to each other anymore and I wouldn’t have to worry. Since then my mom blocked Bob on everything (even though he has reached out and has asked about her more than once lol). 

Now my mom and I get along, though we’re still in the process of building that trust again, and Bob and I get along really well too. He told me today that he's glad his son is dating me and sees just how happy it made him. That every time he comes over, the house is filled with laughter and joy and he considers me part of the family. 

So there's a happy ending to all this drama! Adam and I have gotten even closer and plan to move states soon and buy a home. He’s supported me through all of this and much more and has been the best partner I could’ve asked for. 

I hope you guys enjoyed my story and I’ll answer any questions you have! Honestly I left out a lot but I’m writing this on a doc and am on page 5 so I figured I’d end it here lol

Smaller two-seater options are ideal for creating a cozy and intimate seating area.

Traditional furniture would consume space, but curved designs free it.

## Buying Recommendations & Conclusion

When choosing a curved patio couch, consider your specific needs, budget, and style preferences. Assess the size and shape of your patio,the number of people you typically entertain,and the level of weather resistance required for your climate. A powder-coated aluminum frame offers the best value for durability and weather resistance. Prioritize cushions made with waterproof and UV-resistant fabric.

a curved patio couch can be a transformative addition to any outdoor living space, offering a perfect blend of style, comfort, and sociability. While cheaper options might potentially be tempting,investing in a high-quality couch will provide years of enjoyment and enhance your outdoor experience. Considering its unique design and potential for social connection, for users seeking to add elegance to their outdoor space it's hard to resist.

Hi 👋🏼

Thought I'd put myself out here to see if I could get a friend or a chat partner. Once-off is fine, but I'd prefer a semi-regular longer term buddy if possible. 

I'm your average run of the mill next door girl. If having no special talents was a talent, I'd be right up there in the ranks! I like hiking, sunny days, a longish walk a few times a week, coffee, horses, and hanging out with friends and family. I'm pretty chill and laid back with decent listening skills. I also like jokes including dark humour. 

So yeah, feel free to reach out if you are keen. Come with a bit of an intro or something interesting instead of a generic greeting, please. 😌 ",3,1754020251.0,MeetNewPeopleHere,0,1.0,False

Started my intermittent fasting journey about 2 months ago when I read a couple medical journals that proved that restricted time eating can help with PCOS symptoms, which I struggle with. I haven’t been totally dedicated to it, but have already lost around 6 pounds. Does anyone practice this method 5 days on 2 days off? I’m thinking about doing this to allow myself some freedom on the weekends. Also if anyone has any tips or tricks for me to continue this journey + PCOS specific tricks. Additionally, is it safe for women to do this when they’re on their period? Also— I’ve heard negative things about women skipping breakfast. My method has been to drink black coffee in the morning, which helps suppress my appetite, and my first meal of the day is lunch time usually noon-1ish. Always protein heavy.

1membq1,https://www.reddit.com/r/emotionalneglect/comments/1membq1/im_just_tired/,I’m just tired,"I just so exhausted and frustrated living with my parents. My dad is always draining my energy with his carelessness.

He doesn’t take care of his health and is about to retire. He smokes, eats 2-3x more than he needs to be eating, doesn’t exercise, sometimes gets a cocktail ready before he even sets down his lunchbox after coming home from work, and will have 3 drinks a night. 5+ on nights where he doesn’t need to work the next day. All he does is go to work, drink, sit on his phone, smoke cigarettes, and eat. Quite literally that’s all he does.

He doesn’t clean the counter after getting salt, breadcrumbs, or anything else on it. Stirs his coffee with a spoon and then lays it right on the counter. Doesn’t close the bathroom door, flush, or wash his hands unless he’s going #2. He doesn’t do dishes or laundry. He rarely cooks.

The house needs new exterior paint, a new roof, new siding and he lets it sit. He has the money for it but doesn’t want to do the work of organizing it. He doesn’t keep up with the maintenance on his vehicles and like our 2 lawnmowers we had needed to have the carburetors rebuilt multiple times in the past few years because he left gas in them. My mom told him our weedwacker wasn’t running right 3 different times that I heard. He started it and told her it seems fine. He didn’t actually run it because when my mom told me about it, I could tell it was running lean. The fuel lines broke so I ended up fixing it. He has multiple vehicles he says he’s going to sell but never does anything to get rid of them. I posted one of my motorcycles for sale and now he wants me to post his motorcycle for sale for him. Ik for a fact he would never even offer me anything in exchange for doing it. I started paying rent to my parents about a year ago because my dad complained to my mom about how I was living here for free. I work full-time, am saving for a house, and go to college part-time. It’s not like I’m just free-loading or that I don’t help them around the house.

If something doesn’t go the way he thinks, he gets super mad and starts blaming people. He was going to make an ad on Facebook for a garage sale we were having and asked me how to add pictures to the post (which I’m surprised he didn’t already know). He had to enable Facebook to access his photos in his settings and when he went back to Facebook, he couldn’t find the post he was working on (it was in a different tab). He started blaming me and told me that I never help him and that he’s asked me hundreds of times. I had to tell him 3 times that this was the first time he asked me to help with this and that I won’t help him anymore if he yells at me. Then he finally stoped but didn’t apologize. Or if someone calls him out on something, like when I told him to stop picking up my dog because he was growling at him, he gets all “poor me, it’s always my fault, I can never do anything right”.

Growing up, he constantly made me cry with his comments about how lazy I was or that I wasn’t worth it. I started having suicidal thoughts at about 12 and would spend most of my time by myself in my room. In high school when I wanted to do wrestling instead of basketball, he went on a rant of how I’m throwing away years of my life and that I’m a f****t for wanting to do wrestling.

Just tonight, I was warming up some leftover brats in the microwave and left some containers of mustard, ketchup, and onions on the counter to put on them. I took my dog outside to go to the bathroom while my brats were heating up and when I got back inside, he had pushed my condiments further back on the counter with his plate and started making sandwiches right where I was a few minutes earlier. The rest of the countertop was clear. He could’ve made his sandwiches 2 feet to the right but he for some reason decided to do it right where I had my stuff sitting out. I had to wait for him to move and then move all of my stuff to the other side of the kitchen to finish making my food. He’s done this multiple times.

Im sorry for the rant, I’m just tired of it all. Can anyone else relate to these types of things? I feel bad because it’s my dad but I just hate my life. I want to move out but don’t want to rent, houses are expensive, and I feel so unsure about myself and my abilities.",3,1754020164.0,emotionalneglect,0,1.0,False

I’ve always had trouble getting up in the mornings but nothing like I’m experiencing right now. Even with a good 7-9 hours of sleep, I can’t get out of bed until 10-20 minutes before often making me late for work and just not as presentable as I’d like. Previously, I would get up at LEAST an hour before, do my makeup, and have time to grab coffee on the way.

This feeling of brain fog/eye strain is lasting the going through the whole day. I’m too tired to exercise or do anything productive. It’s really irritating me because I’m a dancer and have a really active lifestyle normally especially during the summers I do a lot of swimming and hiking.

I’ve noticed my eyes being more irritable than normal, I’ve had to stop wearing my sunscreen and mascara because it makes me feel this way but now it’s happening without mascara and without sunscreen. I thought it could maybe be due to being on screens too much but I also notice it very badly during/after work where I’m not on screens at all.

1mem53p,https://www.reddit.com/r/BestBuyBotanicals/comments/1mem53p/is_green_maeng_da_right_for_you_a_comprehensive/,Is Green Maeng Da Right for You? A Comprehensive Overview of the Most Popular Kratom Strain,"# 🔰 1. Overview

* **Name:** Green Maeng Da (often abbreviated as GMD)
* **Vein Color:** Green
* **Strain Type:** Cultivar/blend, not a region
* **Origin:** Thailand (original concept), now cultivated mostly in Indonesia

**""Maeng Da""** means ""pimp grade"" in Thai — originally used as a marketing term to imply premium quality or high potency.

# 🌱 2. Botanical Identity

* **Species:** *Mitragyna speciosa*
* **Plant Family:** Rubiaceae (coffee family)
* **Part Used:** Mature kratom leaves
* **Alkaloids:** Mitragynine (dominant), 7-hydroxymitragynine, paynantheine, speciogynine, mitraphylline, others

# ⚗️ 3. Processing & Harvest

* **Leaf Selection:** Large, mature green-vein leaves with consistent midrib color
* **Drying Method:** Usually dried in a controlled indoor environment or shade-dried to preserve alkaloid profile
* **Grind Type:** Fine powder, micronized powder, or crushed leaf
* **No Fermentation:** Unlike reds (e.g., Bentuangie), Green MD is not fermented

# 🧪 4. Alkaloid Profile

* **Mitragynine:** \~18–24% (higher than most greens)
* **7-Hydroxymitragynine:** Low (<0.5%), but synergistic
* **Other notable alkaloids:**
   * Speciogynine – muscle relaxant
   * Paynantheine – smooth muscle relaxant
   * Corynantheidine – mild opioid antagonist
   * Mitraphylline – immune support, anti-inflammatory

This high mitragynine content gives Green MD its **“stimulating but not jittery”** profile.

# 🧠 5. Effects Profile

* Mood and motivation support
* Pre-workout or physical activity
* Mild pain relief without sedation

# 🧾 8. Dosing Guidelines (Informational only; not medical advice)

|Moderate|2–4 grams|Focus, stimulation, mild euphoria|
|Experienced|4–6 grams|Stronger mood boost, potential pain relief|
|High|6+ grams|Sedating, less energetic, more tolerance risk|

Capsules usually contain 0.5–0.7g each.

# ⚠️9. Precautions

* May cause nausea if taken on an empty stomach
* High doses can lead to overstimulation, headaches, or irritability
* Daily use can lead to tolerance or dependency
* Not for use with MAOIs, SSRIs, alcohol, or sedatives
* Stay hydrated

# 🔂 10. Variants & Related Strains

* **Super Green Maeng Da** – extra potent leaves, sometimes micronized
* **Enhanced Green MD** – infused with extract (more euphoric)
* **Green MD Capsules** – slower onset, more convenience
* **Green MD Extracts** – high alkaloid, fast onset, short duration

# 🔁 11. Compared to Other Greens

|**Strain**|**Compared to Green MD**|
|:-|:-|
|Green Borneo|Milder, more relaxing|
|Green Malay|Longer lasting but smoother|
|Green Indo|More subtle, less stimulating|

* Use responsibly — it’s powerful, especially in extract or enhanced forms.

The Yomiuri Giants enter this clash as the clear favorite, with decimal odds hovering around **1.70** (implied probability: \~59%), while the DeNA BayStars sit at **2.00** (\~50%). That 1.5-run spread (-1.5 for Giants, +1.5 for DeNA) suggests bookmakers expect Tokyo’s豪门 to win comfortably. Meanwhile, the total runs line is set at **4.5**, with nearly even money on over/under. Translation? This isn’t a fireworks show—it’s a pitcher’s duel waiting to happen.

**Digesting the News: Heroes, Zeros, and Shoelaces**  
DeNA’s Eita Sano is the star of the show, teetering on the brink of **100 career home runs**. He’s already notched two bombs in his last game, including the franchise’s **8,500th home run**—a milestone that’s less “Oh my God, a round number!” and more “Wow, that’s 8,500 chances to trip over your own ambition.” Sano’s also a Tokyo Dome menace, with **9 home runs** in the stadium, trailing only Yokohama’s 45 and Shimbun’s 19 (yes, a newspaper team. Baseball’s weird).

Then there’s Kazuhiro Kuwahara, DeNA’s 14-year veteran, who’s **one hit away from 1,000 career knocks**. At this rate, he’ll join the 1,000-hit club before his coffee goes cold. For context, that’s like nailing a hole-in-one while juggling.

The Giants? They’re the Godzilla of NPB, but they’re facing a DeNA squad hungry to cut the gap in the standings. A win here would leave the BayStars just **1.5 games back**, which in baseball terms is closer than your teenager to their phone.

1mem48k,https://www.reddit.com/r/FriendshipAdvice/comments/1mem48k/i_cant_decide_what_to_do/,i can’t decide what to do,"Hey everybody. I just need some advice from an outside perspective.

I had a friend for almost 13 years. Her and I were basically inseparable for the first 8 years of our friendship. We did everything imaginable together, walking through middle and high school and into college with each other as support.  I really didn’t have a lot of other friends, and neither did she, so we really only talked to each other, as well. We had maybe one or two arguments during that entire friendship. I really did enjoy her company and find her to be an amazing friend. She drove me around when I couldn’t drive, she helped me move around to different homes, she joined clubs for me and worked with me, she was always there for any issue I had, and I did my best to do the same for her.

I really noticed about 3 ish years ago, though, that this friend had a serious issue with flaking on me. Anytime I attempted to make plans, she would cancel. Either a medical problem, a family issue, or she’d just not show up/cancel as I’m leaving the house.  We would do school events together, and she’d leave me to do it alone (even when we did dress up days in high school. I’d be dressed up by myself.) My family had even started to realize this was a habit and felt bad for me a little bit.
Once we really got into college, she was a mostly online student, and I was in person. I’d attempt to make plans to do work together or just get dinner or coffee, but alas, nothing ever came out of it. I even invited her to a get together I had with some new friends I made, and she said I never invited her to begin with.  I’ve been with my newest partner for a year on August 20th, and she met him one time. He asked to get together with her partner for dinner, and she declined. 
 
My final straw was a huge event that was held for me to celebrate something I achieved. She told me she would be there, and never showed up. No apology, no explanation. Nothing. I gave her about 5 days to reach out, and she didn’t say anything. She had some issues with some relatives going on (that I really tried to be supportive about, asking for updates and whatnot. She didn’t want to discuss), which was I assume the reason for missing it, but I never really got that clarity. So I chose to remove her on social media for a while. I went to potentially reconcile a few days later and found I was entirely blocked, not just unfollowed.   

That event was about 4 months ago now. We haven’t spoken since. I feel really guilty for just removing her and not communicating how I felt, but in previous cases where this was an issue, I had told her my exact feelings and she had promised to work on them- she just didn’t. I cannot decide if I should attempt to reach out and apologize for potentially dismissing her at a time of need with family, or if I should just move on from that friendship and accept it may have not been my fault. What do I do? ",1,1754019502.0,FriendshipAdvice,0,1.0,False
1mem3vc,https://www.reddit.com/r/lonelymeyerspod/comments/1mem3vc/saw_naked_gun_tonight_and_you_should_too/,Saw Naked Gun tonight and you should too!,"Just left the theatre and already know I’ll probably be back to see that one. There’s just so much this movie gets right that I think should be celebrated. First of course is just having a dedicated COMEDY comedy felt so refreshing. It’s been actual years since I got to go to a theatre and just see something funny for the sake of being funny. Secondly, as a lifelong fan of the Naked Gun franchise since I was a kid, I felt this movie 100% nailed the tone and humor of the originals while being modern and updated. A spoiler example: >!when Frank tries to disable the P.L.O.T device and two YouTube ads play on the HUD before he can put any inputs in!< . That’s a classic NGesque joke but totally hits with a modern crowd. There’s so much to look at and you’re rewarded for looking around the frame. There’s a coffee shop in a single shot named “Flicking the Bean”. There’s visual and textual jokes in the credits (and an after credits scene). Thirdly: the cast all around just nails it. Liam Neeson is the best choice to take on this role, Pamela Anderson just kills it and it’s refreshing to see age appropriate romantic interests, Walter Houser is made for this franchise. Finally: the crowd was just having the best time. Everyone left the theatre beaming and quoting the movie to each other already, I saw older fans talking about the original franchise and younger people having a blast too. 

I hope that studios see this and Friendship and see that the children yearn for mid budget comedies on the big screen. Anyways, righteous kill, go see this bitch in your local cinemaplex. ",18,1754019471.0,lonelymeyerspod,5,1.0,False

He thought about going to see a doctor quite a few times, but decided against it and relied on over-the-counter medications. Medications that didn’t do jack squat to help. When he didn’t get any sleep, Morgan decided to use this time to work on things he had put off—a mini mountain of art projects, a TBR pile of manga, and house repairs. During the night, he would stay awake, and just a few hours before work, he would crash and sleep for about four and a half hours.

Morgan fought with his arm until he finally decided to get himself out of bed and to the bathroom for a much-needed shower. He got dressed and headed into work. Walking into the hospital towards the security room, his co-worker raised his head. “Well, look who the cat dragged in,” his co-worker Phil grinned, sipping on a cup of coffee. How many had he had so far? “Good morning, Phil.” Morgan stifled a yawn, and Phil made a face.

“Man, did you sleep at all?” his co-worker questioned. Morgan laughed, shrugged his shoulders, and took a seat.

“Enough to survive.” Phil sighed, shaking his head. “You need to see a doctor about that,” his co-worker said, taking one last look at the security camera screens before heading to the door. Morgan waved a hand over his shoulder, dismissing Phil, who left without another word. Even if it sounded a bit dismissive, he did care about the advice people gave him, but it had become second nature to him. That it no longer bothered him or was an extreme concern.

That night when Morgan arrived home he kicked his shoes off at the front door and made his way into his bedroom.

Getting dressed down for bed, he tossed the things from his pockets onto the dresser and pulled on a shirt and shorts, settling into bed with his phone. Checking his social media to wind down before trying to get some sleep. Noticing it had been a while since he posted something. He went to his photos. Scrolling through until he spotted a folder labeled *The* *Sleeper.*

When did he create this?

Morgan scratched his head in confusion…what the hell is *The Sleeper*? Had one of his friends do this as a prank? Curious, he taps on it to see what random mismatch of photos were in this. A bunch of spinning circles finally load to dozens of photos taken of himself when he was asleep. What the actual fuck?!

Could it be possible that his phone camera was hacked? Shaking his head, he presses a button on the side of his phone to close the screen. Before he tossed it onto the bedside table and turned out the lamp. Getting under the covers and decided to just worry about this tomorrow. Maybe in his free time, he should get a few security cameras and set them up.

If his friends were doing this, then he would need evidence to confront them. If it was someone else, then they were breaking into his home unnoticed. Though, wouldn’t he have seen the signs or noticed if anything was out of place? Not unless they were really good at breaking in and slipping out without leaving a trace. The following day, while Morgan was out, he picked up some small home cameras and placed them throughout his house.

If there was in fact someone breaking into his home, either it be one of his friends or a stranger, Morgan would need the footage as proof that this was going on. Also, to prove that he was possibly not crazy. When he had a chance to look at some of the recordings, it would go to fuzzy grey static around 3:30 a.m. During one of those nights, Morgan awoke to a feeling of someone watching him.

As he turned over, blearily opening his eyes, he saw an inky figure above him. Face or lack of face, to be more exact, a few inches away from his. Swallowing thickly, he closed his eyes tighter and pulled the blanket up to his chin. What the hell was this thing? Where exactly did it come from?

He knew that this house wasn’t haunted, but there was definitely something supernatural going on. Morgan decided to show Phil his co-worker the video clip he had saved to his phone. Who thought it was some special effects that he had added to the others. In other words, Phil believed it to be fake and his story fabricated. Even his close friends thought the same when he sent them the clip through text message.

Why didn’t anyone believe him? Even now, when he checked his phone, there were new pictures. These ones were different from the others, though. There were of himself smiling towards the camera, his eyes solid black. A shiver went down his spine as he tried to recall when he did that.

That night, Morgan decided to stay up until 3:30 AM the time that the inky shadow itself had shown up. That time, he had woken up in the middle of the night because he felt someone watching him. Sitting up in bed, he flipped through TV channels, passing the time. It wasn’t too long before time drew closer, the room growing cold, and his phone camera made the capture click noise. Picking it up, he looked towards the direction it had flashed, seeing… himself.

His… no, the doppelgänger’s eyes were wide and unblinking. Morgan stood ready to confront them when he became light-headed and fell to the floor. When he woke up, he frantically began searching for his phone that he dropped when passing out. Morgan raised his head, looking at the wall in front of him to see a crudely drawn picture of himself on the wall in some type of black substance. Above it was written in blood, “ *I am watching,”* and just above him stood the inky figure looking down at him. 

Phil looked at the clock seeing it was past time for Morgan to be at work. It wasn’t like him to be late or not call if there was an emergency. He sent him and text and tried to call but didn’t get an answer. Phil scrolled through his phone to see if he had nay contacts that could go check on Morgan. When he noticed a folder on its home screen labeled *The Sleeper.*

1mem0bl,https://www.reddit.com/r/pourover/comments/1mem0bl/extremely_low_yield/,Extremely low yield,"So, I'm new to brewing coffee in general, and I have been practicing to make a good pour over coffee. I watched some tutorials and most of them have the same method: rinse the paper, 1:15-1:17 ratio, blooming and divide the pour into 2-3, or divide into equal pours, etc. But I hadn't seen (or remembered) any source explaining the end yield, i.e.: the coffee result in the cup.

I tried using 15g of medium ground coffee (14 in my Timemore C3S) and 240g of water. I did all the step I usually do, rinsing, taring, and after brewing of 3 minutes, the drop stops. I remove the cone and only got 77 grams. Which is very low according to some sources. 

I don't know what's wrong, but I'm pretty sure even if I messed up the pouring, swirling, or even grind size, I will still get significantly higher than that. I haven't realize I have this issue and I have been brewing like this for months now.

by [https://www.gptsportswriter.com](https://www.gptsportswriter.com) **Nippon-Ham Fighters vs. Orix Buffaloes: A Battle of Bullpens and Banter**  
*August 1, 2025 — Escon Field Hokkaido*

The Nippon-Ham Fighters and Orix Buffaloes clash in a matchup that’s less “epic rivalry” and more “two teams hoping their backup plans work.” Let’s break down the numbers, news, and why this game might be the most thrilling thing since someone figured out how to deep-fry ice cream.

---

### Parse the Odds: Who’s the Favorite?

The moneyline odds favor the **Hokkaido Nippon-Ham Fighters** at \~1.65 (implied probability: \~61%) versus the Orix Buffaloes at \~2.10 (implied: \~48%). The spread? Nippon-Ham is -1.5 runs, meaning bookmakers think they’ll score at least two more runs than your average coffee order. The total is set at 6.5 runs, with “Over” priced slightly lower than “Under,” suggesting oddsmakers expect a mid-70s slugfest.

Statistically, Nippon-Ham’s farm team has been a scoring machine, racking up an 8-5 win over the Hawks with Tetsuto Yamada and Shota Imanaga going nuclear. Meanwhile, Orix’s pitchers have been a mixed bag: Daichi Mochida (1.91 ERA) is a human vacuum cleaner for balls in play, but their rotation’s 3.68 ERA average suggests they’re more “meh” than “magic.”

---

### Digest the News: Injuries, Updates, and Why DAZN is Cheaper Than Your Self-Esteem

The Orix Buffaloes’ recent farm game win (2-1 vs. Kintetsu) was a breath-hold clinic in tense pitching, but their 2024 season ERA of 2.63 (team average) is a mirage—ask them after they gave up 17 runs to the Yomiuri Giants. Conversely, Nippon-Ham’s offense has been a leaky dam, with their farm team scoring 8 runs on Rakuten like they were playing “clear the board” with a baseball bat.

As for injuries? The article helpfully mentions

I want to ask him where he see this going if he wants it to be causal or he wants a relationship but my friend told me not to because it would probably scare him off. but i really want to ask him because id rather know now if he wants something casual or he sees this going somewhere. for me, i realize i maybe moved too fast by initiating intimacy first but i also wouldn’t mind exploring a relationship with him, but if he doesn’t want that id rather not get attached and keep it casual also. so do i ask him the next time i see him or is it too soon? and if i do ask him, how would i phrase it without sounding too serious ?",1,1754018925.0,Advice,3,1.0,False

I was made redundant a couple of months back and I am in a fortunate situation now where I have been offered 3 roles which are all relevant but all lead to somewhat different career path. 

As someone made redundant in the current market, I didn’t think much about my ideal next role and instead applied for all relevant jobs and put in a lot of time in my applications. I should also mention that 2 of these 3 opportunities have been offered through networking with the right people. One coffee catch up led to 3 introductions and 2 interviews which both have resulted in job offers. 

Now I am faced with choices thankfully. 

1. Job with a successful fintech that’s growing its revenue by 30 pct each year but my role will not be so exciting and pays 25 pct less than my previous role. On a positive side, the Company is very successful and progression is possible where I could be making 2x in 5 years time. 

2. Job with a local small financial services firm with total staff of less than 200. They are nimble and have been successful but I see this firm as old school slow moving and stable career path. The role pays same or slightly more than what I was drawing in my last role. Also this role is most aligned with what I have loved doing in my previous roles. 

3. Job with Big 4 consultancy with a somewhat new practice. The role will pay the same as my last role but is more aligned to my career path than Option 1. Biggest attraction for me is the brand name and flashy offices etc, however, given the new practise I am not sure of the exit options. 

I am keen to hear your views and opinions.

P.S. thanks to all those who encouraged me on my last post about redundancy. I really appreciate that",0,1754018752.0,auscorp,5,0.5,False

1melsa0,https://www.reddit.com/r/novelsfree/comments/1melsa0/the_rose_that_ended_my_marriage/,The Rose that ended my Marriage,"Ten years ago, my father’s illegitimate daughter gave my mother a red rose.
That night, my mother held that rose and took her own life.
On our wedding day, my husband swore, “You’ll never see a red rose again.”
Then my father’s illegitimate daughter showed up at our company, a red rose pinned to her dress.
He fired her without hesitation.
For the first time, I believed in love.
But today, I returned to celebrate my biggest achievement—
Only to be greeted by a sea of red roses.
And standing beside my husband was her again.
“She prepared all this for you,” he said. “Thought you’d be surprised.”
“We’re sisters. We should get along,” she added.
I looked at them coldly and walked away.
This time, the rose won’t kill anyone.
It will kill our marriage.
————
The year after I took my SATs, it was my mother’s birthday. My father came home accompanied by a woman and her daughter, carrying a single red rose.
My mother silently accepted the rose from the little girl and spent her 39th birthday in quiet resignation. That night, she took her own life by opening her wrists.
So, on our wedding day, I told my husband, Alexander Montgomery, ""If you want a divorce, just give me a bouquet of red roses.""
He held me and said, “Don’t worry, flowers will never find their way into our home again.”
Five years later, the company, Harrison & Montgomery Inc., was accepting bids for a project. When a representative from a bidding company wore a red rose on his lapel, he had him thrown out and blacklisted the entire firm.
That day, I realized that marriage could actually be something worthwhile.
Then, six months later, I completed the research for a new formula and walked out of the lab.
The entire hallway was blanketed with red roses.
And there stood the woman who had once been banished from the company, smiling brightly, beside him.
I kept my face cold, but the man said nonchalantly, “These are surprises from Isabella for you. She’s your sister, and here to mend fences.”
I stared at Alexander for two frozen seconds before turning on my heel.
I’d never had a sister.
And from that moment on, I no longer needed a husband, either.
I spent three hours alone at my mother's grave today. It’s her birthday and the tenth anniversary of her death.
Those red roses had witnessed my parents' love.
Ten years ago, on this very date, my father watched as Isabella Clark handed my mother the red roses, shattering her spirit.
Red roses were my personal taboo.
A decade later, my husband brought back the woman who drove my mother to her death, carrying the very red roses I despised, and dealt me a fatal blow.
In the distance, fireworks erupted. That was Alexander’s celebration for the successful development of the new formula.
I led the team, working tirelessly for six months, 180 days of sleepless nights.
But at this moment, it felt like Isabella’s victory declaration.
I bid my mother farewell and stood to leave when Alexander’s call came through.
His voice was filled with intoxication.
“The celebration is winding down, and you, my head of R&D, are MIA. How does that look?”
I held my tongue and stayed silent.
Any other night, I might have coaxed him with playful protests. But not tonight.
Alexander raised his voice, “Emily Harrison, I’m speaking to you! Where are you?!”
“The cemetery.”
Dead air. Then, as if the haze had lifted just enough to recall today was the anniversary of my mother’s passing.
As if he’d finally remembered that for the sake of the new formula development, I’d sacrificed my birthday and anniversary dinner.
My only request was that he accompany me to visit my mother.
After a brief pause, about two heavy beats, Alexander finally spoke.
“I…got carried away with the celebration, I forgot.”
“Meet me at the cemetery.”
I slammed the phone down and turned to leave.
But when I reached The Old Carriage House, I received a message from Alexander:
“Emily, it’s too late today. Rain check?”
“Isabella got tipsy. Gotta get her home safe first.”
“Promise I’ll make it up to you.”
Not a shred of surprise.
With Isabella’s scheming ways, I knew she’d cling to Alexander tonight.
Her game was transparent.
And Alexander—a man who’d built an empire from scratch—saw it too. But he just didn’t care.
Because he enjoyed it.
Because my feelings meant less than dust.
But it was fine.
From now on, I no longer needed to care.
That night, Alexander Montgomery didn’t come home.
He didn’t send a message or a phone call.
I didn’t care, nor did I ask.
The next day, I arrived at the office early.
Alexander was the CEO, and I was the head of R&D.
In five years, our company had grown from The Old Carriage House to an office in the heart of the city’s CBD.
But our relationship, on the other hand, had only grown more distant.
The first phase of the new formula’s development was complete, and for the time being, there wasn’t much else to do.
I was sitting at my desk, sipping coffee, as I opened the divorce settlement sent by my lawyer. That’s when Alexander walked into my office.
“Isabella sprained her ankle last night, so I stayed to take care of her for a while.”
“ It got so late, I just crashed at a nearby hotel.”
I nodded, keeping my focus on the divorce papers, and casually responded, “Got it.”
After all, we were about to divorce.
Who he sleeps with or where was no longer my concern.
No need for explanations.
Alexander hesitated, opening his mouth to say something but stopped himself.
“Let’s have dinner tonight. You’re the main contributor to the success of the new formula, after all. We should celebrate.”
He paused, glancing at me, then added, “ Want me to invite Isabella? You two should talk. She was just a kid when your mother died.”
Hearing him defend Isabella like that made my hand falter for a moment.
I couldn’t help but think, wasn’t I a child when my mother ended her own life?
Suppressing the anger boiling inside me, I took a sip of my coffee and said softly, “Not your call. Just us tonight.”
After all, we were discussing our divorce. Having anyone else around would be inappropriate.
As for a sister?
I only have one mother. She only has one daughter.
Alexander mistook my coldness for jealousy. He smirked and was about to speak when the sound of a phone ringing interrupted his thoughts.
Seeing the name “Isabella” on the screen, he smiled knowingly, grabbed his phone, and quickly left.
Later, just before the end of the workday, I received a message from Alexander. It was a reservation at a private restaurant, the Grand Oak Tavern.
I knew this was his way of compensating me.
I tucked the printed settlement into my bag and prepared to head out.
As I left the building, Alexander’s car passed by. He rolled down the window.
“ Go home and freshen up. Quick client meeting. I’ll be there soon.”
Before he finished speaking, his car had already driven off.
In the past, whenever I had a date with Alexander, I would spend two hours getting ready.
Each time, I’d go through the struggle of choosing clothes and putting on makeup, even though I wasn’t good at either. It was both painful and somewhat joyful.
But this time, there was no need for that.
I found a nearby wellness parlor to relax and ease my tired body. It felt good to let myself unwind after all the long nights of working overtime.
By the time I got to the tavern, Alexander still hadn’t arrived.
I texted him, but there was no reply to my text.
I shook my head and didn’t wait for him like I usually would. Instead, I ordered my meal.
The private restaurant had a lovely atmosphere, and the food was delicious.
It was a far cry from the boxed lunches we’d eat at the office.
So even though Alexander didn’t show up in the end, I wasn’t upset.
After all, he had already let me down after seven years of marriage. Why should I care about this one missed dinner?
Truth was, signing those papers would be the only compensation that mattered.
After dinner, I walked slowly back home.
Endless nights of overtime had made me feel disconnected from the world. The bustling streets, however, rekindled a spark of life.
Suddenly, on a familiar street, I stopped in my tracks.
Only then did I realize that the House Alexander and I had rented when we first started our business had long been demolised.
The Artisan Bakery we used to visit every day just to save a buck was now The Continental Bakery.
That’s when it hit me: everything had irrevocably changed.
Even the memories I once cherished had faded with time and crumbled to dust.
My phone rang. It was my mentor calling.
Her voice had a hint of hesitation as she asked, “Emily, I saw you applied to join the  Project Phoenix yesterday. The organization has approved it.”
“But I still need to confirm one thing. Are you sure about this?”
“ This will take five years minimum. Without you, Harrison & Montgomery Inc. could plummet.”
“Do you think he’ll agree?”
I took a step forward, leaving that familiar street behind. My voice was firm as I replied, “Mentor, I’m divorcing him.”
 
Project Phoenix was imminent, and I wanted to leave as soon as possible. I made arrangements with my mentor for someone to come pick me up the next day.
No desire to linger, I took a cab home.
The lights were on in the living room, and there was Alexander, sitting on the couch, texting.
As soon as he saw me, the furrow in his brows relaxed, and he rushed over to grab my hand, questioning me.
“ Why weren’t you at The Grand Oak? I showed up to an empty table—do you know how humiliating that was?”
I stilled for a moment, surprised that he had actually shown up.
But seeing him question me so arrogantly, I couldn’t help but find it a bit laughable.
But then again, it was normal.
He had gotten so used to me waiting for him in the same spot.
I yanked my hand away from his, “I was done eating. Why stay?”
Maybe realizing he was in the wrong, Alexander suppressed his irritation and handed me a gift box.
“I bought this for you today. Open it and see.”
I wasn’t surprised. After all, with all the times he had canceled on me, he had to make up for it somehow.
This was typical of Alexander—whenever he messed up, he’d try to sweeten things up a little.
And I’d always nervously wait, hoping he’d compensate me more, maybe even spend a little more time with me.
I took the gift box and casually tossed it on the sofa.
“You’re too generous.”
I responded politely.
His smile faltered, and for the first time, he seemed to notice my indifference.
A hint of panic flickered in his eyes as he tried to take my hand again.
Just then, Isabella’s voice came from upstairs.
“Alexander, maybe I should go.. Wouldn’t want your wife getting the wrong idea”
When she came down the stairs and saw me, Isabella quickly masked the smug look in her eyes, covering her mouth in feigned surprise.
Alexander rushed to explain.
“Isabella sprained her ankle yesterday. I took her for a check-up today, which is why I was late.”
“She’s immobile, so I let her stay in the guest room for just one night.”
After saying that, Alexander stared at me closely, almost as if afraid I might get angry.
I nodded and casually replied, “Then I’ll book a hotel. I won’t share the same roof with her.”
Alexander was taken aback, clearly not expecting this reaction from me.
“If her presence bothers you, I’ll drive her…”
Before he could finish, Isabella stumbled down the stairs, clutching her foot and beginning to fake cry.
Alexander’s face went pale in shock, and he quickly rushed to help her back to the room to massage her foot.
As I grabbed my suitcase and was about to leave, Alexander returned to the living room.
He pressed his lips together, tightly grasping my hand, unwilling to let go, his guilt deepening with each passing second.
Finally, amidst Isabella’s persistent nagging, he spoke.
“Tomorrow, we’ll visit your mother. We’ll talk it over with her face to face.”
I turned and left without expression.
Talk?
I’d rather talk to my lawyer.
The moment Isabella appeared in the room, I didn’t even want to talk about the divorce with him anymore.",2,1754018448.0,novelsfree,0,1.0,False
1melrbi,https://www.reddit.com/r/mypersonaldevelopment/comments/1melrbi/the_10x_rule_for_career_acceleration/,The 10X Rule for Career Acceleration,"What separates top performers from the rest? It’s not just talent, luck, or connections—it’s the 10X Rule: the mindset of taking massive action far beyond what seems reasonable. While most people set modest goals and work just hard enough to reach them, exceptional professionals 10X their effort, ambition, and persistence—and achieve exponential results.

https://preview.redd.it/1j92von3tbgf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3f80ddf72ef733a694843a162851150d07310365



Why 10X Beats Incremental Growth

A 2021 study from Harvard Business School, led by Dr. Francesca Gino, found that professionals who set audacious goals and pursued them with disproportionate effort were 3x more likely to achieve breakthrough success than those who followed conventional career advice.



Take Sara Blakely, founder of Spanx. She didn’t just tweak existing shapewear—she reinvented it, cold-calling manufacturers and hand-selling her product until it became a billion-dollar brand. Or consider Elon Musk (before Tesla and SpaceX), who risked everything on Zip2 and later PayPal, working 100-hour weeks when others would have quit.



The 10X Rule isn’t about working harder—it’s about thinking bigger, acting bolder, and refusing mediocrity.



The Science Behind 10X Thinking

A Stanford University study (2019), conducted by Dr. Albert Bandura, revealed that individuals with high self-efficacy—belief in their ability to achieve outsized results—consistently outperformed peers, even when starting with similar skills. The difference? They set targets 10 times higher and took relentless action.



Similarly, research from the University of Pennsylvania (2020), led by Dr. Martin Seligman, showed that optimism combined with massive effort was the strongest predictor of long-term career success—more than IQ or education.



How to Apply the 10X Rule to Your Career



1. Set Goals That Scare You

If your goal doesn’t make you slightly uncomfortable, it’s too small. 10X goals force innovation and resourcefulness.



2. Take 10X Action

Most people do the minimum required. 10X performers outwork, outlearn, and outnetwork the competition.



3. Embrace Failure as Feedback

A MIT study (2018), directed by Dr. Amy Edmondson, found that high achievers failed more often—but learned faster. They treated setbacks as data, not defeat.



4. Surround Yourself with 10X Thinkers

Research from the Journal of Applied Psychology (2022), led by Dr. Brian Uzzi, proved that your network’s ambition level directly impacts yours. If you’re the smartest in the room, find a new room.



Real-World 10X Success Stories

\- Howard Schultz (Starbucks) didn’t just open a coffee shop—he redefined global café culture through relentless expansion.

\- Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw (Biocon) started with $500 and built a billion-dollar biotech empire by thinking decades ahead.

\- Daymond John (FUBU) turned $40 into a streetwear revolution by hustling 10X harder than competitors.



The 10X Mindset Shift

Most professionals underestimate what’s possible because they fear overcommitting. But as a Columbia University study (2020), led by Dr. Sheena Iyengar, confirmed: People regret inaction far more than bold attempts.



The 10X Rule isn’t about burnout—it’s about leverage. Work smarter, yes, but also think bigger, act faster, and persist longer than anyone expects.



Your Turn: What’s Your 10X Move?

\- Want a promotion? Deliver 10X the value of your role.

\- Starting a business? Solve a problem 10X better than competitors.

\- Building skills? Learn 10X faster through immersion.



The 10X Rule is the secret of those who dominate their fields. Will you play it safe—or 10X your career?

Anyways, just wanted to share the prequel and first act of the Fillmore fanfiction I had made. Please tell me your opinions. I will be releasing an act each day. 

Prequel: A Long Week Often Starts With A Quiet Morning

	*The scene opens with a shot of X-Middle School as the sun rises, Champagne by Kenny G is softly playing in the background. It cuts between the empty parking lot, empty basketball court, and empty classrooms before cutting to Ingrid as she walks down the empty school hallway, listening to Champagne by Kenny G on her earbuds.*

Ingrid, to herself: I could get used to this. Early morning, calm and smooth jazz?

*Ingrid softly smiles as she continues to walk down the hallway, past the few students who would be here at this early hour. She walks into the commons area, where she finds a few scattered groups of students and a table labeled Breakfast Custard.*

Ingrid, softly: Breakfast Custard?

*Ingrid’s stomach growls and she shrugs.*

Ingrid: I really shouldn’t have skipped breakfast.

*Ingrid walks over and the kid looks up, eyes lightening up when she approaches.*

Kid: Ingrid Third? 

*The kid shakes his head and gets to business, offering a bowl of custard.*

Kid: You want some Breakfast Custard? Made it myself.

*Ingrid looks at it skeptically, then her stomach growls and she sighs.*

Ingrid: What flavors does it come in?*The kid lights up, spreading his hand to gesture at his custard stock.*

Kid: Waffles, Egg, Bacon, Pancakes, Coffee and Hot Chocolate. All freshly made, I baked it this morning.

Ingrid nods, a slight smile on her face: Fine, you talked me into it. I’ll take a Waffle and Bacon please.

*The kid smiles, grabs the two custard containers and hands it to her.*

Kid: That will be 15$

*Ingrid smiles and hands him the money.*

Kid: Thank you, have a good day.

Ingrid: You as well.

*Ingrid walks away, but she notices the table getting more attention once she leaves. She chuckled softly to herself.*

Ingrid: Helped that kid make a living.

*Ingrid takes a bite of custard, and she smiles, a big, joyous smile.*

Ingrid: To be far, he deserves it. This is some darn good custard.

Fillmore, from her radio: Ingrid, do you copy Ingrid?

Ingrid: I copy.

FIllmore: We have a pursuit in progress, south hall. 

*Ingrid looked at the custard regretfully, before sealing it back up and putting it in her backpack before walking towards the south hall.*

Ingrid: And I was just beginning to enjoy my morning.

ACT 1:  A Dish Best Served Cold.

*Cut to a hallway as a girl runs past. She is dressed in a grey jacket and her red hair whips behind her like fire as she runs. Shoving past people, she takes hurried glances back before turning around the corner to see Fillmore, hands crossed, face cold, and orange safety patrol vest almost glowing in the light.*

 Fillmore: End of the line, Gretchen.

*Gretchen raises her hand and takes a few steps back, looking around for an escape.*

Gretchen: No, no, not like this.

*She continues to take steps back as Fillmore slowly approaches. Gretchen backs up, hastily looking for a way out, but then backs into Ingrid, who places a hand on her shoulder.*

Ingrid: I’m afraid your time stealing free snacks is over.

*Gretchen looks rejected as Ingrid and Fillmore surround her and lead her back to the Safety Patrol headquarters. As they walk, something catches Fillmore’s eye. A small V, painted in red spray paint, located under a nearby locker. He freezes. A flash of blonde hair and a mischievous smile pops into his mind.*

Fillmore, to himself: It can’t be…no, it must be old.

Ingrid turns: You coming, Fillmore?

Fillmore shakes his head: Yeah, I’m coming.

*They slowly walk back to the headquarters, watching as the chaotic mayhem that is X Middle School swirls around them. Gretchen is put in the holding cell and Vallejo walks out of his office with a hot chocolate in his hand.*

Vallejo: Good work guys. Our vending machines are free from hijackers and back to giving to charity.

Fillmore: Thanks.

Vallejo continues: Sorry for not celebrating, but evil never sleeps. We have your next assignment.

 *Cut to Vallejo’s office where he shows pictures of the science lab on the projector. It appears to not be in use, at least, not for a while. A faded sign is posted on the door, labeled Restricted Access.*

Vallejo: We have reason to believe that an underground comic book gambling ring is based in the science lab but all our best efforts have led to nowhere for years.

Fillmore: Of course, can’t make things easy can we?

Ingrid rolls her eyes: So why are we here?

Vallejo: All our best efforts have failed, until now.

*Projector shifts to reveal a boy, with sloppy red hair, freckles and a growl.*

Fillmore: John McDuff.

Vallejo: He just got caught this morning for lunch nabbing. He says he knows how to get in and even how to get a meeting with the big man behind it all.

Ingrid: And you want us to meet him.

Vallejo: Exactly. This is the big catch. We take him down…

Ingrid: The whole school becomes safer.

*Ingrid and Fillmore share a glance, concern and worry but also hope reflected in their gaze.*

Vallejo: Exactly. That is why, as my two best detectives, I’m trusting you with this case.

*Ingrid and Fillmore look at each other and nod.*

Vallejo: What are you still doing here? Go!!

*Fillmore and Ingrid walk out of the room and down the halls heading towards the detention room.*

Ingrid: Do you really think this would work? 

Fillmore: I can’t say.

*Ingrid turns towards him, giving him a look of concern.*

Ingrid: What is it?

Fillmore: I…This is the big leagues. I didn’t even think someone could have such power.

*Ingrid places her hand on Fillmore’s shoulder.*

Ingrid: And you're worried someone could get hurt.

Fillmore: There is always a chance someone gets hurt. But…I don’t like the feeling of it. It seems…

Ingrid: Too easy?

Fillmore: Yeah. Man gets caught and is just ready to spill the beans, for what? A reduced sentence?

Ingrid shakes her head: Maybe he changed? Maybe he is only out for himself? It doesn’t matter. If this has a chance to work, we have to try it.

*They then hear a male scream. Looking at each other, they turn and rush to the detention room, bursting through the door.*

Fillmore: X Safety Patrol!!

*The door slams open and they freeze, Ingrid covering her mouth almost like she’s going to puke.*

1melmwy,https://i.redd.it/kwl6jgd1sbgf1.jpeg,review 🩷,"alrighttt this is my first time posting a haul, but quite a few ppl asked for one when i asked a few questions bf ordering :) *im a HUGE vanilla lover btw*

vanilla lace: MY FAV. i’ve been recommended it a few times, and a lady came into my work and said this is what she was wearing so i had the lotion & perfume… im sure most people have tried/smelt it so i won’t go into details, but it is sooo sweet and i def get an almost. gives a bit of date night vibes, but i will wear almost everyday fs 😹

bare vanilla: was sooo good too!! but it is definitely lighter than vanilla lace. i do get the gorment from it, but not strongly- more of comfortable smell. they are comparable imo, but are distinctively their own.  

cozy vanilla cashmere: it has the fall smell & vibe to it 100% which i’m so happy about 😻 the first spray & smelling from the bottle: it does smell fairly strongly of alcohol- but it doesn’t last that long, just a few secs for the dry down. reminds me of drinking coffee/cider on a porch during fall in the morning, PERFECT to layer with Cinna!!

vanilla and dreamy: this one i was nervous to buy bc people were saying it was that great, while it’s not THAT strong, it has a fresh & vanilla & cozy smell. it is pretty light, and i don’t necessarily think it would last ALL day while working, but it will be a good layer/something casual around the house or going shopping. will use it more casually

cinna-drizzle: THIS is the scent where i was between.. but im soooo happy i went with this one 😻😻😻😻 i agree with people saying it’s like the icing on a cinnabon/roll. it’s sweet, vanilla-y, and i can smell the cinnamon a bit (but not too strong) . i almost wanna say i also smell a lillll bit of pumpkin spice 👀 idk but it’s one of my favs in the haul! when sprayed, it is a lil weird smelling but just give it a min and you will smell EDIBLE. my man hates perfumes and such, but he lovessss sweet and he can stand to smell this one 🥰



im sorry if it isn’t the best review, but please feel free to ask any questions and i can explain better :) happy shopping everyone !! 🩷🩷🩷",16,1754017995.0,Victoriasecretbeauty,2,1.0,False

About George: he started with great success, but lost popularity in the last year of John's life. It was said that he was on the rim of bankruptcy, while others claim that he was still selling and that John had big plans. What is the truth?

When John died, he was working on the October issue and looking for another publisher, because the magazine was no longer profitable. That summer he met new investors to get the necessary funds and start again. Whatever John put in his head, he always managed to achieve it. I am convinced that the magazine would survive, and he would have managed to turn it into a successful digital platform.

The United States today is a deeply divided country. Would John become president, as many still claim today?

""I think he would have dedicated himself to politics. He had said it several times, both in private and in public. I find it difficult to imagine what would have happened if he had become president, the lives of many people around him would have changed, including mine. Through George addressed both Democrats and Republicans, giving both the same space. He had an incredible charm, and there was no republican, libertarian, socialist or democrat who could counter his charisma. It was not something he had learned or studied: it was in his DNA, and he would become a great politician.

If John had chosen to pursue a political career, he would have done it to meet his family's expectations or to follow The heart?

The John I knew would never have done anything just because he was part of his family's expectations. He never gave up in the face of that kind of pressure. He knew what he was doing and would enter politics, once ready and able to make a difference.

The American Love Story series sparked controversy when the first photos appeared on social media. It seems that neither the Kennedy nor the Bessette family have been consulted. Can you confirm it?

As far as I know, both families have not been contacted, but this is a prerogative of Ryan Murphy. There would be a moral issue to consider, but from a legal point of view the creators of the series are not obliged to contact anyone. I'm sure they have good intentions, but for them it's a business. I wasn't consulted either, nor did I expect to be, although apparently my husband is a character in the series, and I imagine I will be too. These are details that don't interest me.

Many disagree with the choice of the cast, and in particular with the styling of Carolyn's character.

«I prefer not to comment. None would be up to Carolyn, because she was unique. The common denominator of Ryan Murphy's series are the protagonists that are difficult to digest. Just think of O.J. Simpson, Jeffrey Dahmer and the Menéndez brothers. This time, however, the story is about a very beloved couple, whose life has been abruptly interrupted. It's a remarkable challenge. When I heard about the negative reactions, I felt the affection that the public still has for Carolyn. It's nice to know that many are fiercely protective of him».

A photo from the set in which Sarah Pidgeon wears black Converse was targeted with criticism on social media: ""Carolyn would never have worn them"". She who knew her so well, what do you think?

«I've never seen her wear Converse, and she didn't even have them in the closet. Some say she wore them when she worked at Calvin Klein, but the idea that Carolyn could pair them with a silk midi skirt makes me shudder. I remember that when I met her I had a pair of Gap sneakers, and she wrote me on a note that our friendship would never grow until I got rid of it. She usually put the New Balance or the Tretorn. In the 90s there was no obsession with sneakers as in today's fashion».

You considered her a sister. What is the dearest memory you have of her?

""I have so many. She came into my life when I was almost 30 years old, I was getting married, my husband had just been diagnosed with cancer and I had to manage much of what was happening behind the scenes. She protected me and accompanied me and Anthony to all the appointments with the doctors. Despite the glamour of the photos taken at the events, she and John They managed to go unnoticed. There were times when the paparazzi caught them fighting in a park, but they still managed to protect privacy. The level of harassment by the press exploded after the wedding».

Who was the real Carolyn?

«She was aware of her worth, intelligent, always gave the best advice and knew how to read inside you. She was an extraordinary, original and interesting person, the kind that probably no one expected John would marry. You could get an idea of her from the photos but then, if you were lucky enough to meet her, your expectations went completely up in smoke, because she was warm and friendly. I'm not a person who loves cuddles, but she embraced everyone. At that time I didn't have friends like her, and she became part of the family. We also had a lot of fun together. She was the friend I wish all women to have».

When talking about her, two contrasting versions emerge: one before she met John, and the other after she married him. The first one was self-confident, magnetic and got what she wanted. The second could not bear the weight of being constantly in the spotlight, she didn't leave the house much, had cut ties with her best friends and tended to fall into depression.

«I couldn't tell her how it was before dating John, but I got to know her well after they got married. She was deep, she wasn't superficial. The last two years of his life have been difficult. She suffered a lot because of what was happening to my husband. People don't want to understand that much of John's anxiety was due to the fact that Anthony was sick and died, and the consequences also affected his marriage, his friendships and Carolyn's. We had all understood that there was nothing left to do, and Carolyn was trying to make it clear to John too, that he did not want to accept reality. She took him by the hand, and made him understand how important it was to spend time with Anthony that summer. It's not true that he had stopped seeing his best friends, because I know who they were, and they were all present. Regarding depression, I think he struggled to deal with the situation, like all of us».

Could Carolyn imagine what she would have been waiting for when she started dating John?

«You can't avoid something you've never experienced before in advance. There was a great obsession with John on the part of the press and people, and it is forgotten that back then famous people did not share much of their private life and did not take selfies. Reality shows and social media did not exist, and celebrities were also more protected. A photo was worth a lot of money: it was disturbing to go out for a coffee with the dog and find ten photographers following you and putting themselves in front of you, walking backwards, to take frontal photos. They would have done anything. Carolyn could never have imagined having to deal with all this, and the situation was complicated by what was happening to Anthony. Show me someone who can be under such pressure without having any failures. It's easy to judge when you have no idea what you're talking about.""

Many say that John and Carolyn were not on good terms at the time of death, that they had not lived together for a couple of weeks and would have divorced if they remained alive.

«The weekend before they died, we were all at Martha's Vineyard. John, Carolyn and her friend Jessica, and Christiane Amanpour with her then husband James Rubin, who were family friends. Anthony's end was approaching, and we wanted to be by his side. In the last few days, John was working on Anthony's eulogy. That Monday he flew to Canada to meet an investor, and on his return to New York he took a room in a hotel near my house, because he needed to isolate himself to write. We spoke a couple of times, I remember talking to him the night before the accident. He was very sad, he needed to be alone. It might seem boring, but it's the truth. I find it hard to understand why people insist on saying that John lived elsewhere. It was not a couple destined for divorce, even if they were facing a very stressful situation for two recently married people. Then came that cursed Friday».

If you could go back in time, would there be anything he wanted to say to Carolyn?

«I've always regretted not saying ""I love you"" to her before hanging up, the last time we talked. She called me from the airport, we made plans for the next day. In the end, she told me: ""I love you, honey"", as she always called me. I was very tired and I think I answered something like ""see you soon, bye"". I scolded myself so much over the years, but then I forgave myself, because she knew how important she was to me. I would give anything to be able to spend a day together again, like I used to. Tell Anthony, John and Carolyn what happened in my life, tell them I'm fine. Even just one day, but not in the past. I wish I had them all in my apartment now, and I know we would laugh out loud at the absurd things that happened to me».

How do you imagine your future?

«I'm going through a moment of transition and reflection. I feel like I've lived four different lives, and thinking about the next twenty years discourages me. I'm writing my third book and considering going back to making documentaries, but I'm not in a hurry. I feel like I'm destined to have to do something else. I don't know what yet, but I know it will bring me Peace and serenity. One day, everything will make sense».",11,1754017747.0,JohnAndCarolyn,7,0.87,False

1melhsn,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1melhsn/i_need_advice_for_running_away_tw_sh_suicidal/,"I need advice for running away (TW: SH, suicidal thoughts, “abuse”, and under 18 poster)","I originally posted something with a similar title in AITIA, but was told by a friend to ask for the advice I need here too 

Here is the gist of it:

I 14F, have lived with my parents since I was born (hopefully obvious). Tensions have been high the past few years, with my parents fighting constantly as I questioned my gender and sexual identity, causing my mental health to plummet. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, but multiple times I have stopped caring for myself, and a fog has settled over my emotions. I’ve begged for a therapist, but “they will tell me to go to hell because I’m pansexual” or “it’s too expensive.” We live in Texas, so yes, it’s a conservative place, but therapists are supposed to be unbiased. But back to the point.

Today I started my period, and I’ve been getting it since I was 9 1/2, so it’s nothing new, I’ve also broken my arm multiple times, had my faced stomped on, and almost cut my finger off. So I know what pain is. But these have been some of the worst cramps ever, feels like I’m being stabbed in the abdomen. My mother has also started her period today, (we’ll call her Sarah to make my life easier) and instead of pain, she becomes violent. 

Earlier today I was asked to sweep up all the animal hair around my house (we have cats and dogs), and to wash the dishes. I did both, filling up a small Home Depot bucket with hair twice and doing a second run, filling it up again. I started to do a third run but found nothing so I stopped. I called my father (let’s call him John) and he said to do it again because “he knows I didn’t do it right” so I double checked it, and there was nothing. I logged on to play some games with my friend. 

Fast forward to when Sarah got home. She walked in the door, already angry from something that happened at her job with a co worker. Immediately she starts yelling about my clarinet case on the table along with a soda bottle, my Pokemon cards on the counter, and my clay pottery she just gave me sitting beside the sink. She yelled about how my dad has been pressuring her to keep the house clean and about the papers that have been on her desks for months that he seems to notice. Sarah then yells about the chair in the kitchen I was sitting on while washing dishes (I will admit i forgot to put it away) and how he never notices that.

Before I dive into the threat, some background: 

Our house is not clean right now, Sarah got horribly sick and couldn’t keep it up, we’ve been working really hard to clean it up, and have made a lot of progress. I usually end up doing most of the work since I’m “lower to the ground” (I’m taller than my mom btw at 5’5 1/2)

Our ac went out two days ago and we just got it back today, I’ve been having to go to pre school band camp everyday for the past week, and when the ac was out, I couldn’t eat, let alone sleep because it was so hot. So I’ve been running of coffee and tea for the past two days. Here is my routine for band camp: 
- get up at 6
- shower
- try to eat
- gather band stuff
- leave at 7:30
- arrive at school at 8
- leave school at 11:00

And I come home exhausted from screaming at pep rallies (for the incoming 6th graders) and playing my clarinet. Just to come home and whip that clarinet out again and practice the material, then do all my chores, and try to focus enough to talk to my friends.

(I’m sorry this is so long I promise this is the last piece of background)

As my parents have been fighting for so long and I often get dragged into the fights I resorted to my wrists to get rid of the mental pain. I’ve been clean for a month now but it’s more tempting right now than ever. When I called my friend about to swallow a whole bottle of Tylenol after a particularly bad week, she told me not too, calmed me down, and we made an escape plan for when it gets bad again.

OK NOW BACK TO THE STORY I PROMISE 

After Sarah finally went to go change to work out, I asked my dad why she was upset. He blows up and says something pretty much like “she’s on her period! You use that for an excuse all the time, why can’t she!” I shut up after that. For context I said I was on my period earlier today because I could barely stand up due to cramps and needed to lie down (he let me.) Then as I was cleaning up what my mom wished me too (the soda, cards, clarinet case, etc) and begin to put it away. Sarah begins to yell about how John pressures her to clean and doesn’t notice my messes. 

I sigh audibly, I’m tired, in pain, and can’t have another two Tylenol for 2 hours. Sarah takes that as a sign of disrespect and turns to John saying (and I quote word for word) “do I have to leave this one for you, I left you the other one, and it gave you grand babies already.” (She is referring to my half sister, BIL, and her two kids) John chuckles and says “ah, but they are expensive to bury.” And I can tell he is just trying to mediate but he is also upset at me for “causing a problem” 

My mom then says “I wouldn’t fcking bury her ah, I would throw her in the backyard for the fvcking coyotes”

Let that sink in.

I’m appalled, I knew she says a lot of things that she never acts on, but this genuinely shocked me. I’m genuinely afraid of Sarah, she’s acting erratically and constantly angry.  We do really have coyotes in our neighborhood (they killed my cat when I was five) and I feel like she just hates me.

I want to contact my friend and initiate our escape plan and get out of here. How do I do that safely, and without chance of them finding me?",3,1754017553.0,Advice,0,1.0,False
1melgwp,https://www.reddit.com/r/creepypasta/comments/1melgwp/the_corner_of_my_room/,"""The Corner Of My Room""","My name is Liam Amiams. I'm a student at Kerzinger University. And this is my... well... last story I'll ever tell. It's been a week now, I think. It's hard to tell the days that go by when I'm... here. I don't exactly know how much time I have left until the connection disappears, but I'm quickly telling this in hopes someone will find it.

This happened to me on August 25th.

I had moved into a small house for the fall semester. I figured I needed somewhere to crash at, considering I didn't have many friends in college at the time. 

And with my parents not being financially viable, there was no way I would be able to stay at their house without the issue of paying for most, if not all, of the bills.

I was already as financially empty as it is. And this rental for the semester was gonna empty my wallet dry. Not even the payments at a coffee shop job were gonna keep me stable. I only had a couple hundred left.

Luckily, the neighbors around me weren't so bad, and one woman even complimented me about my blue eyes.

Whatever keeps me positive while I study, I guess. I don't know. I guess you can say that I was trying my best to start my future with open arms.

But unfortunately, life can be mysterious in certain ways. And it can bring negative things whether you like it or not.

And it started from one tiny little thing.

Normally, I'm not keen on focusing a lot on my surroundings, especially when it comes to my own bedroom.

But as the week progressed, I started to notice... bizarre occurrences. Things around my studying desk would begin to disappear. Pencils, paper, notepads. Even a brand new box of thumbtacks suddenly vanished without a trace.

At first, I thought it was only just me. I mean, working at a coffee shop while in college really puts my mind in so many directions. So it's not hard to assume that maybe it's just my mind messing with me, and I just simply misplaced certain things.

But then came the moments where I wouldn't be in my room, and things would be knocked out. 

Even my own desk chair suddenly tipped over and fell. Making one helluva loud bang from all the way upstairs to downstairs, where I would be making myself something to eat in the kitchen.

Now, if I wasn't already suspecting it to be some weird phenomena happening around my room, I was surely now convinced. 

And that's when I noticed it.

A huge crack had formed. Right in the corner of my room. I didn't seemingly think much of anything about it at first. Because normally with a house like this, or I guess most houses at that, cracks forming on walls or ceilings would just mean that it was just the foundation being old. 

The house did seem to be pretty old. Definitely would need a bit of a remodel if I had enough money for it. 

But there was something odd about this crack in particular. 

It didn't seem like the foundation of the house made that crack appear out of nowhere. It almost seemed to be forcefully pushed out.

As if something was trying to break through the crack itself.

I would eventually call my landlord about it and tell me that a guy should come within the next two days to come and fix it.

And after a while, everything seemed fine. It didn't seem too out of the ordinary. 

Then came a day later. And it was nighttime. I woke up in my bed. My eyes were blurred out by the surrounding darkness around me. 

Then suddenly, I heard a cracking sound. Like drywall being forcefully broken open. I tried to find my phone, but I couldn't seem to find it anywhere. 

I reached out to the nightstand and turned on the lamp next to me. I looked around my room. The cracking noise had stopped. I looked at my nightstand to see my phone laying next to the lamp. 

But then, a thick, black substance suddenly dropped onto the nightstand. My heart stopped as I turned towards the wall right next to my bed... and black slime was slowly coming down. And that's when I slowly looked up.

And I saw it.

Can't exactly describe what it was. It looked human... but at the same time, it looked... distorted. It was certainly tall. And was holding itself onto the wall, with its very human-like eyes staring right at me. 

More black slime was dripping down the wall. And even off the figure itself. I couldn't move. 

I feared that if I took one small step or moved for an inch, this thing would drop off the wall and attack me. But then, it started to move its way around the room, continuing to keep eye contact with me, as it picked up one of my dirty t-shirts from the laundry basket. 

It soon made its way back to where the crack in the corner of my room was, and the light from my lamp soon burst!

It was dark again. 

Luckily, I saw that my phone was still sitting on the nightstand, and I quickly picked up, turning on the flashlight and pointed directly at the ceiling. 

The creature had vanished. So did the black substance that was oozing out of the crack. And the crack was back to normal.

I didn't go back into my room after that. I had to sleep on the couch now until the maintenance guy came to seal the crack on my wall. Luckily, I had the door locked from the outside, so that thing wouldn't be able to get out of my room at night.

It was so strange. It was unlike anything I'd ever seen before. And I would soon take it upon myself to figure out what this thing was. I also bought myself a camera with the money I had left to film the inside of my bedroom at night, hoping to get this thing on film and show it to SOMEONE that would believe me.

That night, while laying down on the couch, I began to look up any kind of documented events similar to mine on my Macbook, hoping that I wasn't the only one that was dealing with this sort of phenomenon. 

That's when I discovered a post from a few years ago on Reddit about someone from Guatemala sharing similar things happening to their grandmother. From jewelry disappearing, chairs being knocked over, and the encounter with the creature. 

The man posting this, who was later determined to be her grandson, says that his grandmother had encountered the creature one night, staring right at her and then disappearing. And as a couple of days went by, the grandmother started to act like nothing happened.

He also said that he did his own research on it, saying that these cracks are a form of ""dimensional breaks"", where universes that accidentally collide with one another for a short period of time causes cracks to form in corners of any room in houses, buildings, vehicles, etc. Portals, as he put it, to which any thing could squeeze through the cracks into our universe, leaving behind a black mass of ectoplasm.

He would soon give these creatures a nickname: ""Corner Dwellers""

I tried to look up any more info on the guy that posted that onto Reddit, but all I could find was a picture of him from a few years ago... from an article that reported him missing.

Lord knows if that Corner Dweller got to him. Luckily, I had everything set up for any opportune moment to capture this thing on camera. I didn't care how much sleep I would lose, I was gonna capture this thing on film if it killed me.

3:15, my clock read. My eyes began to grow tiresome, and my body felt half awake and half asleep, as I kept trying to keep myself awake to see if anything would show up. But unfortunately, I would not get to see it until the next morning.

I had passed out.

In my head, I worried that somehow that thing would get out of that locked room and attack me, but then I said to myself, ""You're safe. You got that door locked up tight. Besides, no other cracks are gonna form elsewhere in the house.""

I soon awoke. Everything seemed normal. I looked at my Macbook, only to find it at 5%. it was soon about to die. I soon plugged it into the charger as I ran upstairs to see if the door was still locked. It was not locked. It was fully open. 

And out of stupid curiosity, I slowly began to walk towards the open door, seemingly thinking that it wouldn't be there during the daytime. And when I looked inside my bedroom, nothing seemed too out of the ordinary. And the crack in the corner of the room was gone. Did the dimensional break fix itself? 

As I walked back downstairs to the living room, I kept thinking to myself about the footage that hopefully recorded the Corner Dweller. I honestly just wanted it to be completely over. So that at the very least, I can show my footage to someone so other people can take caution if they ever encounter a Corner Dweller themselves.

Nevertheless, I went to quickly look at the footage, hoping to capture the Corner Dweller. And I can say that I did catch them on camera... only they looked different from before. They were wearing clothing. Clothing that I once saw in my own laundry basket. And that's when I saw the Corner Dweller face first. While the black substance still covered most of it, it had a fully visible face. A face that I can only describe as being... similar to my face.

I couldn't believe it. This... thing had somehow took the form of myself. And if it wasn't shocking enough, I noticed something else. The door. It was somehow unlocked. And the doppelgänger was carrying something behind them. A foot. No... a leg. No... it was a body. My body!

The doppelgänger soon looked up to the camera and gave a small smile that sent chills down my spine as it reached out towards the crack in the corner of my room. It would soon go through, with me following behind, and the crack suddenly vanishing. The footage soon ends. 

Shocked and stunned, I would soon turn my attention to something else that has completely caught my attention. And that's when I soon began to realize... my house looked... different. Too different. ",3,1754017476.0,creepypasta,0,1.0,False

(TW: SH, suicidal thoughts, “abuse”, and under 18 poster)","I 14F, have lived with my parents since I was born (hopefully obvious). Tensions have been high the past few years, with my parents fighting constantly as I questioned my gender and sexual identity, causing my mental health to plummet. I’ve never been diagnosed with anything, but multiple times I have stopped caring for myself, and a fog has settled over my emotions. I’ve begged for a therapist, but “they will tell me to go to hell because I’m pansexual” or “it’s too expensive.” We live in Texas, so yes, it’s a conservative place, but therapists are supposed to be unbiased. But back to the point.

Today I started my period, and I’ve been getting it since I was 9 1/2, so it’s nothing new, I’ve also broken my arm multiple times, had my faced stomped on, and almost cut my finger off. So I know what pain is. But these have been some of the worst cramps ever, feels like I’m being stabbed in the abdomen. My mother has also started her period today, (we’ll call her Sarah to make my life easier) and instead of pain, she becomes violent. 

Earlier today I was asked to sweep up all the animal hair around my house (we have cats and dogs), and to wash the dishes. I did both, filling up a small Home Depot bucket with hair twice and doing a second run, filling it up again. I started to do a third run but found nothing so I stopped. I called my father (let’s call him John) and he said to do it again because “he knows I didn’t do it right” so I double checked it, and there was nothing. I logged on to play some games with my friend. 

Fast forward to when Sarah got home. She walked in the door, already angry from something that happened at her job with a co worker. Immediately she starts yelling about my clarinet case on the table along with a soda bottle, my Pokemon cards on the counter, and my clay pottery she just gave me sitting beside the sink. She yelled about how my dad has been pressuring her to keep the house clean and about the papers that have been on her desks for months that he seems to notice. Sarah then yells about the chair in the kitchen I was sitting on while washing dishes (I will admit i forgot to put it away) and how he never notices that.

Before I dive into the threat, some background: 

Our house is not clean right now, Sarah got horribly sick and couldn’t keep it up, we’ve been working really hard to clean it up, and have made a lot of progress. I usually end up doing most of the work since I’m “lower to the ground” (I’m taller than my mom btw at 5’5 1/2)

Our ac went out two days ago and we just got it back today, I’ve been having to go to pre school band camp everyday for the past week, and when the ac was out, I couldn’t eat, let alone sleep because it was so hot. So I’ve been running of coffee and tea for the past two days. Here is my routine for band camp: 
- get up at 6
- shower
- try to eat
- gather band stuff
- leave at 7:30
- arrive at school at 8
- leave school at 11:00

And I come home exhausted from screaming at pep rallies (for the incoming 6th graders) and playing my clarinet. Just to come home and whip that clarinet out again and practice the material, then do all my chores, and try to focus enough to talk to my friends.

(I’m sorry this is so long I promise this is the last piece of background)

As my parents have been fighting for so long and I often get dragged into the fights I resorted to my wrists to get rid of the mental pain. I’ve been clean for a month now but it’s more tempting right now than ever. When I called my friend about to swallow a whole bottle of Tylenol after a particularly bad week, she told me not too, calmed me down, and we made an escape plan for when it gets bad again.

OK NOW BACK TO THE STORY I PROMISE 

After Sarah finally went to go change to work out, I asked my dad why she was upset. He blows up and says something pretty much like “she’s on her period! You use that for an excuse all the time, why can’t she!” I shut up after that. For context I said I was on my period earlier today because I could barely stand up due to cramps and needed to lie down (he let me.) Then as I was cleaning up what my mom wished me too (the soda, cards, clarinet case, etc) and begin to put it away. Sarah begins to yell about how John pressures her to clean and doesn’t notice my messes. 

I sigh audibly, I’m tired, in pain, and can’t have another two Tylenol for 2 hours. Sarah takes that as a sign of disrespect and turns to John saying (and I quote word for word) “do I have to leave this one for you, I left you the other one, and it gave you grand babies already.” (She is referring to my half sister, BIL, and her two kids) John chuckles and says “ah, but they are expensive to bury.” And I can tell he is just trying to mediate but he is also upset at me for “causing a problem” 

My mom then says “I wouldn’t fcking bury her ah, I would throw her in the backyard for the fvcking coyotes”

Let that sink in.

I’m appalled, I knew she says a lot of things that she never acts on, but this genuinely shocked me. I’m genuinely afraid of Sarah, she’s acting erratically and constantly angry.  We do really have coyotes in our neighborhood (they killed my cat when I was five) and I feel like she just hates me.

I want to contact my friend and initiate our escape plan and get out of here before it penetrates my walls and that Tylenol bottle starts to look tempting. Please send tips. now my question is

Advice?,"About three weeks ago, I stopped into a local plant shop near where I live. The owner was super friendly, helpful, and really cute. She had a chill, grounded vibe. We chatted a bit, and while she was potting one of my plants, I up the nerve and asked her if she’d want to grab coffee sometime.

She smiled and said, “Actually, I have a boyfriend, but if I didn’t, I’d say yes, because you seem like a really nice guy.” Then she gave me some suggestions for where to meet people in the area, told me most guys don’t have the guts to just ask like that, and said I had a leg up just by being direct.  Honestly , the interaction felt good. It was kind, respectful, and I walked out feeling proud I had tried.

Two weeks later I went back to grab a plant we chatted easily and casually again, and I asked her how she and her boyfriend met. She said they started as friends, but then said they had just broke up that weekend.  Though o was tempted to ask her out again right then and there I held back since it had just happened.  I asked her how she was doing and said it needed to happen for while, it was mutual, and she felt relief.  I told her I’d be back for plant food, and she told me she wanted to see a picture of my hanging plant once I put it up.  

This past Monday I went in, planning to ask her out again… but chickened out. We had some light banter, me telling her that I’d had a housewarming party and her jokingly saying thanks for the invite.  We talked about plans our plans for the week but I just couldn’t pull the trigger.  So I left, and a couple hours later I went back at closing and it was just the two of us-perfect time to ask…and I wimped out again.  Ended up buying two cacti instead. 

So here I am in a weird headspace, On one hand, I feel like she gave me a soft green light.  On the other I’m wondering if I mighta missed my chance, that this girl might be thinking what’s this guys deal, and afraid of being seen as overeager or creepy if I go in again and just ask her out.  All that being said, I’m trying to psych myself and go in tomorrow and just say something like “I know that last time I asked, it wasn’t good timing, but I wanna make up for not inviting you to the housewarming party and see if you’d like to grab a coffee or a bite to eat.  No pressure, but just wanted to put that out there again.” 

TL;DR: Asked out plant store girl, she had a boyfriend. She later tells me they broke up, I didn’t make a move. Now I’m overthinking everything and not sure what the move is.

Would love any advice from people who’ve navigated similar “second chance” dating situations. Do I just go in one last time, own the awkwardness, and ask her out directly? What do you think about my plan?  Should I acknowledge that I know she just got outta something?",4,1754017287.0,dating_advice,3,0.84,False

""You will be declared dead, Gregoria."" That's what Agent Christian told me. My life as an FBI agent was about to end, replaced by a ghost. No contact with my past, not even my husband, Darwin.



But then, a week before my staged death, I walked into our home office and saw it: Darwin's laptop, open, displaying a live video feed. My husband, shirtless, with his assistant, Elyssa Daniel. They were ki\*\*ing. My world tilted.



I watched, frozen, as he ki\*\*ed her. The sounds they made were obscene. I recognized the unique lines of his body, the watch I gave him for our anniversary. I stumbled back, my hand shaking as I reached for my phone. I had to confront this nightmare.



I hit the call button. On the screen, Darwin froze, then answered my call. ""Hey, honey. What's up?"" His voice, so normal, so full of lies, broke something inside me. The phone slipped from my grasp. My heart, my love, my entire world had been a lie.



I spent the night on the office floor, replaying the video. The evidence of his betrayal was a digital tombstone for our marriage. Each time I watched, disgust and pain grew. I looked at my wedding ring, a mark of my foolishness, and threw it across the room.



He thought I was weak, predictable. He thought I loved him so much I'd believe the sky was green. But the woman who loved Darwin Mcintosh died on that office floor. And in that moment, my mission, my fake death, felt like an escape.





Chapter 1

""You will be declared dead, Gregoria.""



Agent Christian' s voice was flat, leaving no room for emotion in the sterile briefing room.



""An accidental death. Tragic, unavoidable. Your life, as you know it, will end. No contact with anyone from your past. Not your friends, not your family. Not your husband.""



The name hung in the air: Darwin. My husband. The man I loved more than my own life, a life I was now being asked to give up.



""I understand the risks, sir,"" I said, my voice steady. I was a professional. I was an FBI agent. This was the job.



But my hands, hidden under the table, were clenched into fists.



Christian nodded, his eyes showing a flicker of something-pity, maybe. He had been my mentor, the one who saw potential in a rookie agent and shaped me. He knew what he was asking. ""This organization is dangerous. They have moles everywhere. To get inside, you have to be a ghost. Gregoria Ellis has to cease to exist.""



""I'm ready,"" I said, and the words felt true. For the mission, I was ready. For my country, I was ready. But saying goodbye to Darwin... that was a different kind of sacrifice. A goodbye he would never even know was happening.



I would just... disappear from his life. He would mourn a wife who was still alive, living a new life under a new name, in a world of shadows he could never imagine.



The thought was a heavy weight in my ch\*\*t.



After the briefing, I left the FBI building, a sense of finality washing over me. In one week, I would be dead. A strange feeling of relief settled in. The decision was made. The path was set. Now, all that was left was to walk it.



As I drove, my phone buzzed with a news alert. A picture of Darwin filled the small screen. He was smiling his charismatic smile, accepting an award for ""Entrepreneur of the Year."" The headline praised him as a philanthropic genius, a devoted husband, a pillar of the community.



Comments flooded the article.



""What a man! And so handsome.""



""His wife is the luckiest woman alive.""



""I wish I had a husband like Darwin Mcintosh.""



A bitter taste filled my mouth. The luckiest woman alive. If only they knew what this lucky woman was about to do, the life she was about to abandon. The love she was about to betray, for the greater good.



My heart ached. I wanted to call him, to hear his voice one last time before I went dark. But I couldn't. Not yet.



My mind drifted back to the week before. I had come home early, planning a surprise dinner. I walked into our home office to grab a file and saw his laptop was open, the screen active.



He must have forgotten to close it.



I moved to shut it, but something on the screen caught my eye. It was a live video feed. A woman was laughing, her head thrown back.



Then a man entered the frame. Darwin. He was shirtless. His back was to the camera, but I knew every line of it. I knew the small, crescent-shaped scar on his left shoulder blade from a childhood fall.



He wrapped his arms around the woman, pulling her close. Her name was Elyssa Daniel. His assistant.



The world tilted. My breath caught in my throat. I watched, frozen, as he ki\*\*ed her. The sounds they made were obscene, a violation of everything I thought we had.



My hand flew to my mouth to stifle a cry.



I recognized the unique lines of his body, the way he moved. It was him. Unquestionably him. The watch on his wrist was the one I gave him for our anniversary.



I stumbled back, my hand shaking as I reached for my phone. I had to call him. I had to confront this nightmare.



My finger hovered over his contact photo-a picture of us on our wedding day, smiling.



I hit the call button.



As the phone in my hand started to ring, the Darwin on the screen froze. He reached into his pocket, pulling out his own phone. The live feed abruptly cut to black.



A moment later, he answered my call. ""Hey, honey. What's up?"" His voice was casual, laced with the warmth I loved.



The sound of it, so normal, so full of lies, broke something inside me.



The phone slipped from my grasp and clattered onto the floor. I couldn't breathe. My heart, my love, my entire world had been a lie.



I spent the rest of the night on the floor of the office, replaying the video over and over. I had instinctively hit record the moment I realized what I was seeing. The evidence of his betrayal was now a file on my phone, a small, digital tombstone for our marriage.



Each time I watched it, the disgust and pain grew, a poison spreading through my veins.



I looked at my wedding ring, the simple gold band he had placed on my finger. It felt like a brand, a mark of my foolishness. I twisted it off and threw it across the room. It hit the wall with a small, pathetic clink.



I remembered a conversation from years ago. A friend of his had cheated on his wife. Darwin had been furious.



""I would never,"" he had sworn to me, his eyes sincere. ""If I ever broke your trust, Gregoria, I'd deserve the worst this world has to offer.""



And I had believed him. I, a trained FBI agent, an expert in deception, had been blind to the biggest lie of all.



When I finally dragged myself out of the office, the sun was rising. I found him in the kitchen, humming as he made breakfast. The smell of coffee and pancakes, once a comfort, now made me sick.



""Morning, beautiful,"" he said, turning to me with that same perfect smile. He pulled me into a hug, his arms strong and familiar.



It felt like being embraced by a stranger.



My body went rigid. I wanted to scream, to claw at him, to show him the video and watch his perfect mask crumble.



But the mission. Agent Christian's words echoed in my head. Gregoria Ellis has to cease to exist.



And in that moment, I realized she already had. The woman who loved Darwin Mcintosh died on the office floor last night.



""I made your favorite,"" he said, gesturing to a plate of chocolate chip pancakes.



""I hate chocolate chips in my pancakes,"" I said, my voice dead.



He froze, his smile faltering for a second. ""You do?"" He forced a laugh. ""Right, of course. I forgot. I must have been thinking of Elyssa, she loves them.""



He said her name so easily. The name of the woman he was sl\*\*ping with. He didn't even realize his mistake.



A cold, heavy calm settled over me. He didn't know me. Maybe he never had.



""It doesn't matter,"" I said, turning away from him. ""I'm not hungry.""



I needed to get out of there. I needed to breathe air that wasn't thick with his lies.



""Are you okay, Gregoria?"" he asked, his voice laced with manufactured concern. ""You seem... distant.""



I looked at him, at the handsome face I once adored, and felt nothing but a vast, empty coldness.



""Just tired,"" I lied. ""Long week.""



He wrapped his arms around me from behind, resting his chin on my shoulder. ""Don't worry,"" he whispered into my ear. ""The weekend is almost here. Just you and me. I promise.""



A promise. From him, the word was a joke.



In one week, I would be dead. And he would be free to be with her. The thought should have destroyed me.



Instead, it felt like the beginning of my own freedom.





Chapter 2

The next morning, I woke to the feel of his lips on my neck. A wave of nausea rolled through me.



Before my mind was fully awake, my body reacted. I shoved him away, hard.



Darwin landed on the floor with a soft thud, looking up at me with wide, hurt eyes. The confusion on his face was so genuine it was almost comical.



""Gregoria? What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice thick with sl\*\*p.



""Nightmare,"" I mumbled, turning my face into the pillow. ""Sorry. Just a bad dream.""



It wasn't a lie. My life had become one.



I felt the bed dip as he got back in, but he kept his distance. I could feel his gaze on my back, but I didn't turn around. I just lay there, my stomach churning, wishing he would disappear.



Eventually, he sighed and got out of bed. ""I'll go make breakfast,"" he said, his voice still sounding wounded.



I waited until I heard the shower start in the guest bathroom before I sat up. The guest bathroom. He was being considerate, letting me sl\*\*p. Or maybe he just needed to wash her scent off of him.



I crept out of the bedroom and down the hall. The door to our home office was slightly ajar. I pushed it open and saw him standing by the window, his back to me. He was on his phone, a soft smile playing on his lips as he typed.



I didn't need to see the screen to know who he was talking to.



The phone in his hand was a sleek, new model. Not the one he usually carried. A burner phone. A secret phone. For his secret life.



His smile widened as he read a reply, and he let out a soft, breathy laugh. It was an in\*\*mate sound, one he used to share with me. The sight of it, directed at someone else, felt like a physical blow.



He must have sensed me there because he suddenly stiffened and spun around.



His eyes widened in panic when he saw me. In a single, fluid motion, he shoved the phone into his pocket, his smile vanishing.



""Gregoria,"" he said, his voice a little too loud. ""You're up. I was just checking some work emails.""



A blatant lie.



""Is everything okay for the company gala tonight?"" I asked, my voice betraying none of the turmoil inside me. I was an agent. I knew how to wear a mask.



He looked relieved that I hadn't pressed him about the phone. ""Everything's perfect. It's going to be a big night for us.""



He walked over and tried to put his arm around me, but I stepped back. ""I'm going to get ready,"" I said, avoiding his eyes.



He watched me go, a flicker of unease in his expression.



As I showered, the hot water beating down on me, I could hear him talking to our housekeeper downstairs.



""Please make sure Mrs. Mcintosh's dress is perfectly pressed,"" he said. ""She needs to look her best tonight.""



The housekeeper cooed, ""You're such a good husband, Mr. Mcintosh. So thoughtful.""



I leaned my head against the cool tile of the shower, a bitter laugh escaping my lips. A good husband. He was a master of deception, and the whole world was his audience.



The gala was a sea of tuxedos and glittering gowns. As soon as we arrived, I saw her.



Elyssa Daniel.



She was standing near the bar, wearing a slinky red dress that left little to the imagination. The same dress I had seen her wearing in the video on Darwin's laptop.



Our eyes met across the crowded room. A slow, triumphant smile spread across her face. She knew exactly who I was.



She walked toward me, her hips swaying. She stopped right in front of me, her eyes flicking over my simple black dress with disdain.



""You must be Gregoria,"" she said, her voice dripping with fake sweetness. ""Darwin talks about you all the time.""



""I'm sure he does,"" I replied, my voice cold.



Her smile widened. ""He told me you love chocolate chip pancakes. I made them for him this morning. He seemed to enjoy them.""



The calculated cruelty of her words was meant to wound me, to show me how deeply she had infiltrated my life.



I felt a flash of white-hot anger. This woman, this parasite, was gloating about stealing my husband, my life, right to my face.



""He also told me,"" she leaned in closer, her voice dropping to a wh\*\*per, ""that you're cold in b\*d. Predictable.""



That was it.



My training, my control, everything snapped.



""A dog will eat anything you put in front of it,"" I said, my voice low and dangerous. ""That doesn't make the ga\*\*age taste good.""



Her face flushed with anger. Her hand flew up, her long nails aiming for my face.



I was faster. I grabbed her wrist, my grip like iron. With a sharp twist, I spun her around and slammed her against the bar.



Bottles rattled. A glass fell and shattered on the floor.



The entire ballroom went silent.



Every eye was on us.



I heard a sharp intake of breath and then Darwin's voice, booming with authority.



""What in God's name is going on here?""





Chapter 3

The silence in the ballroom was absolute. You could hear a pin drop. All that remained was the faint tinkling of ice in forgotten drinks and the sound of my own harsh breathing. My hand still gripped Elyssa' s wrist, the bones fragile under my fingers.



Darwin strode toward us, his face a mask of controlled fury. He was the king in his castle, and someone had dared to disrupt his perfect party.



""Let her go, Gregoria,"" he commanded.



I didn't move. My eyes were locked on Elyssa. She was now playing the victim, tears welling in her eyes, her lower lip trembling. The performance was flawless.



""Darwin,"" she whimpered, reaching for him with her free hand. ""She attacked me. For no reason.""



He looked from her tear-streaked face to my cold one. His gaze flickered down to the red dress she was wearing, and for a fraction of a second, I saw something in his eyes. Annoyance. Not at me, but at her. She had been careless.



Then his attention snapped back to me, his expression softening into one of concern. ""Are you hurt?"" he asked, his voice low and in\*\*mate, meant only for me.



The shift was so quick, so masterful, that anyone watching would see only a devoted husband worried for his wife.



I saw the truth. He was angry she had been so blatant, so reckless as to wear that dress tonight.



I released her wrist. Elyssa stumbled back, collapsing against Darwin' s ch\*\*t for support.



""Tell me what she did,"" Darwin said, his voice turning to ice as he addressed Elyssa. He pushed her away slightly, his hands on her shoulders, holding her at arm's length.



""I... I just came to say hello,"" Elyssa stammered. ""She just... she went crazy.""



""She said you're a dog who eats ga\*\*age,"" another woman from the crowd piped up, eager to add to the drama.",1,1754017026.0,romancenovels,1,1.0,False

I’m an aviation enthusiast here in Knoxville chasing a lifelong dream — to become a pilot. I’m looking to connect with local aviation folks, whether that’s at Downtown Island Airport (KDKX), Raby Airpark, Big South Fork, or any of the other local fields.

I’d love to spend time around planes and the people who fly them — whether that’s by volunteering at events, helping keep things tidy around the hangar, or just tagging along to learn more about what goes on behind the scenes in general aviation.

If you’re a pilot, CFI, aircraft owner, or part of a flying club, I’d really appreciate the chance to connect and learn from your experience. Even just a conversation over coffee or at the airport would mean a lot.

Feel free to message me if you know of any opportunities or folks I should meet.

Blue skies,
Kemar.

""You will be declared dead, Gregoria."" That's what Agent Christian told me. My life as an FBI agent was about to end, replaced by a ghost. No contact with my past, not even my husband, Darwin.  
  
But then, a week before my staged death, I walked into our home office and saw it: Darwin's laptop, open, displaying a live video feed. My husband, shirtless, with his assistant, Elyssa Daniel. They were ki\*\*ing. My world tilted.  
  
I watched, frozen, as he ki\*\*ed her. The sounds they made were obscene. I recognized the unique lines of his body, the watch I gave him for our anniversary. I stumbled back, my hand shaking as I reached for my phone. I had to confront this nightmare.  
  
I hit the call button. On the screen, Darwin froze, then answered my call. ""Hey, honey. What's up?"" His voice, so normal, so full of lies, broke something inside me. The phone slipped from my grasp. My heart, my love, my entire world had been a lie.  
  
I spent the night on the office floor, replaying the video. The evidence of his betrayal was a digital tombstone for our marriage. Each time I watched, disgust and pain grew. I looked at my wedding ring, a mark of my foolishness, and threw it across the room.  
  
He thought I was weak, predictable. He thought I loved him so much I'd believe the sky was green. But the woman who loved Darwin Mcintosh died on that office floor. And in that moment, my mission, my fake death, felt like an escape.  
  
  
Chapter 1  
""You will be declared dead, Gregoria.""  
  
Agent Christian' s voice was flat, leaving no room for emotion in the sterile briefing room.  
  
""An accidental death. Tragic, unavoidable. Your life, as you know it, will end. No contact with anyone from your past. Not your friends, not your family. Not your husband.""  
  
The name hung in the air: Darwin. My husband. The man I loved more than my own life, a life I was now being asked to give up.  
  
""I understand the risks, sir,"" I said, my voice steady. I was a professional. I was an FBI agent. This was the job.  
  
But my hands, hidden under the table, were clenched into fists.  
  
Christian nodded, his eyes showing a flicker of something-pity, maybe. He had been my mentor, the one who saw potential in a rookie agent and shaped me. He knew what he was asking. ""This organization is dangerous. They have moles everywhere. To get inside, you have to be a ghost. Gregoria Ellis has to cease to exist.""  
  
""I'm ready,"" I said, and the words felt true. For the mission, I was ready. For my country, I was ready. But saying goodbye to Darwin... that was a different kind of sacrifice. A goodbye he would never even know was happening.  
  
I would just... disappear from his life. He would mourn a wife who was still alive, living a new life under a new name, in a world of shadows he could never imagine.  
  
The thought was a heavy weight in my ch\*\*t.  
  
After the briefing, I left the FBI building, a sense of finality washing over me. In one week, I would be dead. A strange feeling of relief settled in. The decision was made. The path was set. Now, all that was left was to walk it.  
  
As I drove, my phone buzzed with a news alert. A picture of Darwin filled the small screen. He was smiling his charismatic smile, accepting an award for ""Entrepreneur of the Year."" The headline praised him as a philanthropic genius, a devoted husband, a pillar of the community.  
  
Comments flooded the article.  
  
""What a man! And so handsome.""  
  
""His wife is the luckiest woman alive.""  
  
""I wish I had a husband like Darwin Mcintosh.""  
  
A bitter taste filled my mouth. The luckiest woman alive. If only they knew what this lucky woman was about to do, the life she was about to abandon. The love she was about to betray, for the greater good.  
  
My heart ached. I wanted to call him, to hear his voice one last time before I went dark. But I couldn't. Not yet.  
  
My mind drifted back to the week before. I had come home early, planning a surprise dinner. I walked into our home office to grab a file and saw his laptop was open, the screen active.  
  
He must have forgotten to close it.  
  
I moved to shut it, but something on the screen caught my eye. It was a live video feed. A woman was laughing, her head thrown back.  
  
Then a man entered the frame. Darwin. He was shirtless. His back was to the camera, but I knew every line of it. I knew the small, crescent-shaped scar on his left shoulder blade from a childhood fall.  
  
He wrapped his arms around the woman, pulling her close. Her name was Elyssa Daniel. His assistant.  
  
The world tilted. My breath caught in my throat. I watched, frozen, as he ki\*\*ed her. The sounds they made were obscene, a violation of everything I thought we had.  
  
My hand flew to my mouth to stifle a cry.  
  
I recognized the unique lines of his body, the way he moved. It was him. Unquestionably him. The watch on his wrist was the one I gave him for our anniversary.  
  
I stumbled back, my hand shaking as I reached for my phone. I had to call him. I had to confront this nightmare.  
  
My finger hovered over his contact photo-a picture of us on our wedding day, smiling.  
  
I hit the call button.  
  
As the phone in my hand started to ring, the Darwin on the screen froze. He reached into his pocket, pulling out his own phone. The live feed abruptly cut to black.  
  
A moment later, he answered my call. ""Hey, honey. What's up?"" His voice was casual, laced with the warmth I loved.  
  
The sound of it, so normal, so full of lies, broke something inside me.  
  
The phone slipped from my grasp and clattered onto the floor. I couldn't breathe. My heart, my love, my entire world had been a lie.  
  
I spent the rest of the night on the floor of the office, replaying the video over and over. I had instinctively hit record the moment I realized what I was seeing. The evidence of his betrayal was now a file on my phone, a small, digital tombstone for our marriage.  
  
Each time I watched it, the disgust and pain grew, a poison spreading through my veins.  
  
I looked at my wedding ring, the simple gold band he had placed on my finger. It felt like a brand, a mark of my foolishness. I twisted it off and threw it across the room. It hit the wall with a small, pathetic clink.  
  
I remembered a conversation from years ago. A friend of his had cheated on his wife. Darwin had been furious.  
  
""I would never,"" he had sworn to me, his eyes sincere. ""If I ever broke your trust, Gregoria, I'd deserve the worst this world has to offer.""  
  
And I had believed him. I, a trained FBI agent, an expert in deception, had been blind to the biggest lie of all.  
  
When I finally dragged myself out of the office, the sun was rising. I found him in the kitchen, humming as he made breakfast. The smell of coffee and pancakes, once a comfort, now made me sick.  
  
""Morning, beautiful,"" he said, turning to me with that same perfect smile. He pulled me into a hug, his arms strong and familiar.  
  
It felt like being embraced by a stranger.  
  
My body went rigid. I wanted to scream, to claw at him, to show him the video and watch his perfect mask crumble.  
  
But the mission. Agent Christian's words echoed in my head. Gregoria Ellis has to cease to exist.  
  
And in that moment, I realized she already had. The woman who loved Darwin Mcintosh died on the office floor last night.  
  
""I made your favorite,"" he said, gesturing to a plate of chocolate chip pancakes.  
  
""I hate chocolate chips in my pancakes,"" I said, my voice dead.  
  
He froze, his smile faltering for a second. ""You do?"" He forced a laugh. ""Right, of course. I forgot. I must have been thinking of Elyssa, she loves them.""  
  
He said her name so easily. The name of the woman he was sl\*\*ping with. He didn't even realize his mistake.  
  
A cold, heavy calm settled over me. He didn't know me. Maybe he never had.  
  
""It doesn't matter,"" I said, turning away from him. ""I'm not hungry.""  
  
I needed to get out of there. I needed to breathe air that wasn't thick with his lies.  
  
""Are you okay, Gregoria?"" he asked, his voice laced with manufactured concern. ""You seem... distant.""  
  
I looked at him, at the handsome face I once adored, and felt nothing but a vast, empty coldness.  
  
""Just tired,"" I lied. ""Long week.""  
  
He wrapped his arms around me from behind, resting his chin on my shoulder. ""Don't worry,"" he whispered into my ear. ""The weekend is almost here. Just you and me. I promise.""  
  
A promise. From him, the word was a joke.  
  
In one week, I would be dead. And he would be free to be with her. The thought should have destroyed me.  
  
Instead, it felt like the beginning of my own freedom.  
  
  
Chapter 2  
The next morning, I woke to the feel of his lips on my neck. A wave of nausea rolled through me.  
  
Before my mind was fully awake, my body reacted. I shoved him away, hard.  
  
Darwin landed on the floor with a soft thud, looking up at me with wide, hurt eyes. The confusion on his face was so genuine it was almost comical.  
  
""Gregoria? What's wrong?"" he asked, his voice thick with sl\*\*p.  
  
""Nightmare,"" I mumbled, turning my face into the pillow. ""Sorry. Just a bad dream.""  
  
It wasn't a lie. My life had become one.  
  
I felt the bed dip as he got back in, but he kept his distance. I could feel his gaze on my back, but I didn't turn around. I just lay there, my stomach churning, wishing he would disappear.  
  
Eventually, he sighed and got out of bed. ""I'll go make breakfast,"" he said, his voice still sounding wounded.  
  
I waited until I heard the shower start in the guest bathroom before I sat up. The guest bathroom. He was being considerate, letting me sl\*\*p. Or maybe he just needed to wash her scent off of him.  
  
I crept out of the bedroom and down the hall. The door to our home office was slightly ajar. I pushed it open and saw him standing by the window, his back to me. He was on his phone, a soft smile playing on his lips as he typed.  
  
I didn't need to see the screen to know who he was talking to.  
  
The phone in his hand was a sleek, new model. Not the one he usually carried. A burner phone. A secret phone. For his secret life.  
  
His smile widened as he read a reply, and he let out a soft, breathy laugh. It was an in\*\*mate sound, one he used to share with me. The sight of it, directed at someone else, felt like a physical blow.  
  
He must have sensed me there because he suddenly stiffened and spun around.  
  
His eyes widened in panic when he saw me. In a single, fluid motion, he shoved the phone into his pocket, his smile vanishing.  
  
""Gregoria,"" he said, his voice a little too loud. ""You're up. I was just checking some work emails.""  
  
A blatant lie.  
  
""Is everything okay for the company gala tonight?"" I asked, my voice betraying none of the turmoil inside me. I was an agent. I knew how to wear a mask.  
  
He looked relieved that I hadn't pressed him about the phone. ""Everything's perfect. It's going to be a big night for us.""  
  
He walked over and tried to put his arm around me, but I stepped back. ""I'm going to get ready,"" I said, avoiding his eyes.  
  
He watched me go, a flicker of unease in his expression.

1mel8fm,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1mel8fm,Sweet kitten dumped-looking to adopt him out,"Heya! This morning, a vehicle pulled up and dumped this sweet guy. He's severely underweight and malnourished, covered in fleas and smells like cigarettes. 

At first, because he's so big, I figured he was full grown and just skinny, but as he perks up, I'm convinced he's still a young kitten, likely mixed with Maine Coon (and maybe Russian Blue?). 

He's going to be a handful, but incredibly sweet. He's already super curious, active, and assertive. As he regains strength, I'm sure he's going to have tons of energy. He is stuck to my side and wants to constantly be touching me right now. Also, he has a weird obsession with coffee. Like...instantly knocked it out of my hands and I had to work to prevent him from poisoning himself 😐 grabbed that photo of him still trying to go for the cup as I was cleaning it all up. 

I plan to get him neutered and his rabies shots soon. Since he's underweight, I'll likely give him a few days to recover and heal before bringing him in for the snip. Once he's recovered, I'll need to adopt him out before I get too attached. I already have 2 kitties and a TNR who adopted me. 4 cats is too much, especially adding such a high-energy kitten. He seems like the perfect candidate to leash train (done it many times), and I'll begin that in a day or so once his fleas have been mitigated. 

So, all this being said: I'll be looking for someone to adopt him who has the time/energy to potentially upkeep walking him, etc. If you've always wanted a high-energy, confident adventure cat, he's a great candidate. I'm betting he'll easily get up to 15 lbs, so it'll be almost like adopting a small dog instead of a cat. 

He's also not getting along with my other kitties and may need to be an only cat. My other kitties are curious and are trying to introduce themselves and he quickly scratched up my youngest. This, along with the monetary burden, is another reason I likely cannot keep him in the long-run. 

Reach out to me if you're interested and we can talk from there. Like mentioned, I'm looking for someone who is active and would be able to take him out fairly often. He's not going to be the kind of cat content to spend all day alone....but I wouldn't be surprised if he ends up enjoying road trips and adventures, so he's the kind of cat who can come WITH you while traveling!

1mel7f2,https://www.reddit.com/r/GilmoreGirls/comments/1mel7f2/why_rory_gilmore_is_so_relatable_to_me_even_her/,"Why Rory Gilmore is So Relatable to Me, Even Her Flaws","Growing up, I watched Gilmore Girls and have always related myself to Rory. I was a high achiever and I was always reading and loved coffee since I could point to my mouth asking my grandfather for some coffee. Couldn't talk but I could ask. I always hated how Rory was a bad friend and a homewreaker in later on seasons and how she quite when things didn't go her way but in reality as I soon turn 17, I realized that this truly showed how human Rory is. Rory was a kid and didn't know how to be social and understand what was socially expectable. I was never a bad friend to my friends because I knew what was right and wrong and I was always there for my friends which is what Rory and I differ from. 

  
She grew up having all the time in the world, she shifted from being a kid adjusting to hard classes to going to a competitive school and breaking down the moment someone in her field doubted her. That's like wanting to be a doctor and a doctor tells you that you should look into other fields instead. It crushed her and being perfect all her life was the thing that broke her. She burnt out and she felt like she failed. I go to a highly competitive school and I remember my first day in school going to my English class and I got an essay. I was always great at essays, nothing less than a 90%. What I didn't know was that AICE general paper wasn't any typical class with simple essays structures. I got a D. My jaw dropped, I felt like I was dumb and didn't fit in with any of these kids. That's why I understand her at Chilton. 

Another difference between me and her is that I won't let anyone change my passion or drive in the field I want to work in. I balance myself out and I know I'll do good. People just need to stop talking shit about Rory when she is just another person like us. Yes she's fictional but she is a human being in that show. You cannot expect everything to turn out perfect even on TV. I mean what were you excepting? That she went to Harvard like she wanted since she was little and she became a famous and world renowned Journalist? No, that is not how life works especially when you are struggling in your 20s with the wrong crowd. 

People have good and bad boyfriends, and in my opinion Logan was just not one of those good guys. He slept around with women while dating, he even was sleeping with Rory while being engaged. He didn't try to help Rory gain back confidence to stay in Yale, he introduced her to living with no problems in the rich society removing her small town self, he is immature, and he steals a yacht with her. We all have had or currently have boyfriends who can be good at times but are more often are influential in the ways our parents wouldn't want us to be around. So Rory is ideally the most relatable a realistic character I Know. She saw Logan sleeping around and she was around people who just weren't right for her. She slept with a married man and she harassed his wife. First loves can be hard and she just wanted him back. You can probably think of many people in the media or in your life that have talked bad or have stalked on their exes socials and their new girlfriend. Except she doesn't have social media and she lives in a small down so she just went right over. Is this a right thing to do? Absolutely not, dean wanted to get married to her and that was out of her control, she can't control him or her. She was rude and possessive but she was human at the end of the day. The way I relate to Rory in that sense might be a little drama involved but of course it's highschool. So basically I think it was the summer going into my freshman year of highschool, I have this classmate that I guess was my friend. I had plans with her and this other girl to go to the park. She asked me if she could bring her boyfriend and I said of course why not. Then she told me it was my ex boyfriend. My ex boyfriend from about a year ago and was so pissed. Now what I am about to say will get you guys to be like ""how dare you"" but ive grown from that, I was 14 and I still loved him. For background information, my mom didn't like him as my boyfriend because he was a smoker and he drank but he was a good guy and he never disrespected me but I was moving to away to a different school and so I had to break up with him. I wasn't allowed to see him or text him (I used to and still do texted him and see him). But anyways our relationship was out of control so we had to be friends and that's it. Then I had a small period where I didn't talk to him because we simply just didn't text. In that period is when my friend and him got together. So she asked to invite him and I was shocked and hurt because it was part of girl code or you know out of respect that if you want to date your friends ex boyfriend, you should probably ask if its okay or if it make them comfortable. It was just rude. She could've simply said, ""Hey, I wanted to talk to you about something. I’ve started to catch feelings for \[Name\], and I know you used to date him. I wanted to check in with you before doing anything, because I care about our friendship.""

But she didn't and so with me being as determined and dramatic as a fourteen year old can be, I texted him for about a week. I told him that I found out about him and my friend a couple days in and said, ""that's a shame because I still really like you"". And to my surprise he felt the same way as me. I told him that I didn't condone cheating so if he wanted to be with me then he needed to dump her. Guess what, unlike Rory's situation, it happened. He dumped her and got with me. A week or two later, I ghosted him. Did I regret that? Yeah, he is a great guy but that was rude of me to involve him in my scheme. But I wasn't going to get mad at her and not him. So I can understand Rory. I can understand the jealousy and the doubt and the pity and pettiness because those are human traits. If you want to watch happy and unrealistic endings watch Disney but unfortunately things dont always turn out the way you want them to go. If you dont like Rory then use her and her image as an example of things you should and should do. Listen to your mom like Rory didn't. Get better boyfriends or friends like Rory didn't. IN a more positive side, work hard like she did. Just dont quit when it does get hard

She is a part of me and a part of all of us in some ways more than one. So the next time you think about your hatred towards her, just remember that maybe you dont like her because she reminds you too much of reality itself. Love you guys so much and wish you all the best. Thank you for reading. ",4,1754016677.0,GilmoreGirls,2,1.0,False

Taking it from him, I set the bottle in my lap before looking back at him and saying, ""Marc, what the hell is going on? I just don't understand.""

""Well, looks like hell on earth to me. People have gone crazy and started killing each other.""

""Yeah,"" I huffed, shaking my head in disgust at the hellscape we found ourselves in.

As I started to raise the bottle to my lips, Marco reached out a hand and stopped me.

""Probably shouldn't share, Johnny...just in case,"" he said.

""True,"" I returned, handing him back his bottle before joking, ""Lucky bastard gets the whole bottle to himself.""

A small smile slid onto Marco's face before he took a big swig and laughed while saying, ""Lucky me.""

After calming completely from the nightmare, I was able to find solace in the alone time with Marco.

""You remember that old lady that lived down the street from you?"" he asked.

""Mrs. Greely? Yeah, what about her?"" I responded.

""I could sure go for some of her rhubarb pie right now,"" he chuckled as the words left his mouth.

""Yeah, it uh...sure was great,"" I returned.

""I haven't had that stuff since, hmm...well, shit, your mom's funeral,"" he said in a somber tone.

""Yeah,"" I muttered as the thought of my feeble mother crept into my mind for the first time in a long while.

""Cancer fucking sucks, dude,"" he muttered while taking another gulp of whiskey.

""Well, at least cancer doesn't make you eat people,"" I said, hoping to end the uncomfortable conversation.

As the words left my mouth, the sounds of a lock sliding open broke through the room.

Jeff flew open the door and said, ""Guys....Danny is outside.""

""What!?"" I returned. ""You fucking kidding me, Jeff? You better be screwing with me!""

Catching his breath, he returned with, ""No, NNO! I'm not kidding. He's in the back yard.""

The words stabbed the inside of my ears, and terror filled my chest as I used Marco's shoulder to stand and reached out a hand helping him to his feet.

Making our way to the door, we peered through the window in a huddled mass of anguish and pounding hearts.

""You fuckers never closed the gate?"" asked Tim.

""Damn it, Danny,"" spat Jim.

""Aw hell,"" muttered Marco in despair as he grabbed his mouth and rushed to the bar, puking into the small sink.

""Look at his fucking neck. I can't look at this shit right now,"" said Tim, shaking his head and walking away from the door.

Jeff, Jim, and I continued to stare at what had become of our dear friend.

His once golden head of hair was now stained dark red and brown as the hair clung together in mats covered in bodily fluid and slime.

His tropical clothing was shredded and tattered, hardly clinging to his body as long strands of his shirt hung to the ground dragging behind him.

The devastating injuries almost made him unrecognizable, but his bright pink aloha shirt allowed him to stand out even now in the dark back yard.

Shuffling through the yard, Danny wandered into a thin beam of yellow light from a street light nearby.

The horror felt like a weighted blanket wrapped around my whole body as I took note of his new features.

Danny had deep, unforgiving jagged gouges that traversed his large arms, exposing pieces of his gleaming bright bones.

His nose and lips had been torn from his face, exposing the rows of bright white teeth. Teeth that Danny used to obsess over, making comments like ""Ladies love a man with a clean smile"" and ""Gotta keep 'em pearly white for the press.""

Large chunks of meat hung from his neck and dripped dark blood onto the front of his shirt. The sight caused nausea to wash over me.

""What do we do?"" I asked without allowing my eyes to trail from the hellish scene.

""I think we just hope he leaves by morning?"" suggested Jim, looking for agreement from us.

""I'm not going out there with him...I..... I just can't,"" I said.

Jeff's hand landed on my shoulder, shooting panic through my nerves as I jumped.

""No one needs to go out there. Let's just stick to the plan for the night,"" he returned.

Marco turned on the sink, filled up a cup with water, and rinsed out his mouth.

""We should block the door,"" Marco suggested, wiping the sweat and water from his face.

""What if we can't get out? We would be locked in here with..."" allowing his words to trail off, he peered at Marco.

""With me?"" Marco spat in return.

Tim's eyes traveled to the wooden floor before he said, ""You said that, not me.""

""Yeah, well you fucking thought it!"" Marco responded in a pissed off tone.

""Relax, ladies,"" Jim interjected.

""Look, I get you guys are scared of me or whatever, but look what's out that fucking door right now! Shouldn't we be more worried about him getting in here?""

The thought developed in my brain of Danny's towering figure locked in the small restaurant with us and the damage he would surely cause.

""Let's get a few tables... quietly!"" Jeff said.

We positioned a few of the mahogany dining tables and a few chairs in front of the door before Marco and I returned to the locked closet for the night.

We all awoke to the sound of an explosion in the distance. The heavy vibrations threw a few items off the shelves in the storage room and down onto Marco.

""Holy shit...you ok?"" I asked him.

Sliding the items off his legs and looking himself over, he said, ""Yeah, I'm good. What was that?""

""I have no clue,"" I said.

Jeff knocked on the door before asking, ""You two good in there?""

""Well, we're not eating each other if that's what you're asking,"" I responded.

""Alright, I'm coming in,"" he said before opening the door and ushering us out into the now bright dining room of the restaurant.

""Man, what the hell was that?"" asked Jim, who wore a heavy limp as he made his way over to the bar.

""Bomb?"" suggested Marco.

""I don't know, but it was big enough to draw the attention of all the infected people outside. I was drinking a cup of coffee when that explosion happened, and a huge group of them went sprinting up the street.""

""Danny?"" I questioned while looking at the barricaded door.

""Don't know. I was waiting for everyone to wake up before I tried moving tables,"" replied Jeff.

""Let's eat something before we go opening up the door,"" suggested Jim while going through some cabinets.

""Yeah, I suppose I could eat,"" I responded to the idea.

""I could eat a horse,"" added Tim.

We searched through the kitchen, finding odds and ends to eat. I found a few peaches and a big bag of tortilla shells that I handed out to everyone.

Marco and I took a seat together at a small table on the far side of the restaurant and began to eat.

Marco looked like hell with large rivers of sweat cascading off his forehead and down onto the floor while his cheeks looked flush as if he had run a marathon.

I found it hard to finish my meager breakfast as something about my best friend both concerned me deeply and disgusted me to the maximum.

I somehow hadn't noticed it when I was locked in the small room with him, but now the smell of spoiled meat seemed to follow him around the dining room.

I didn't voice my concerns to the others because honestly, I doubt that smell could have been ignored and would be noticed sooner or later.

The stench seemed to radiate when he spoke, as if he had eaten rotten food and it clung to his tongue, only releasing itself to float through the humid air on his words.

The terrible thoughts of my dream the night prior flashed through my brain again as I attempted to keep a conversation with my averted eyes.

For the first time in a long time, I said a silent prayer for Marco in my mind, begging any listening god to give me a reason to assume better than the worst.",4,1754016665.0,creepcast,1,1.0,False

Bond Villain Parody: “Norman T. Clarity”

  
Bond villain parody

Alias: *The Consultant*

  


Affiliation: The Empire of Acceptable Behavior™

Base: A tastefully grey corporate campus shaped like a giant pie chart

Theme Music: A looping TED Talk beat under fake enthusiasm

  


⸻

  


Backstory:

Norman T. Clarity is the world’s most dangerous mind: the neurotypical middle-manager turned global manipulator. After years of micromanaging the lives of others on mill under the guise of “best practices,” he rose to power through motivational posters, team-building retreats, and “circle back” emails.

  


Now he’s weaponizing normalcy itself, enforcing a world where everyone must function exactly as he does: no stimming, no fidgeting, no deviating from the calendar invite.

  


Appearance:

	•	Always wears navy slacks and a pastel button-down

	•	Carries a clipboard even in combat

	•	Maintains 100% eye contact to establish “rapport” (i.e., dominance)

  


⸻

  


Evil Plan:

The Consultant has launched Project Socialize or Die, a global initiative that uses AI to scan for “abnormal behavior” and flags anyone who:

	•	Avoids eye contact

	•	Doesn’t respond to “How are you?” with “Good, thanks, you?”

	•	Needs time to process instead of blurting things out instantly

  


Once flagged, individuals are sent to the Normalization Chamber, where they’re forced to:

	•	Roleplay fake customer service calls

	•	Navigate loud, crowded break rooms

	•	Engage in unskippable small talk about weather and brunch

  


All while The Consultant paces behind them, saying things like *“It’s not that hard. Just be yourself — but less.”*

  


⸻

  


Bond’s Challenge:

Bond infiltrates the office as a temp worker but is nearly exposed after failing the mandatory “Team Personality Typing Lunch” (he says he’s an INTJ — a red flag).

  


⸻

  


Signature Lines:

	•	*“We don’t do ‘meltdowns’ here. We do mindfulness.”*

	•	*“If you can’t adapt to chaos, are you even trying?”*

	•	*“Sorry, we’re a family here.”*

  


⸻

  


Weakness:

Can be defeated by sincere emotional honesty, blinking lights, or someone saying “That doesn’t work for my brain” without apologizing.

  


⸻

  


Closing Scene:

Bond shoves The Consultant into the Break Room Simulator™ where he is forced to listen to coworkers describe their weekends in vague, exhausting detail. His final scream is simply: *“WHY WON’T YOU JUST ACT NORMAL?!”*

  


  


Henchman: “Smiley”

  


Real Name: Unknown

Role: Chief Enforcer of Social Norms

Appearance:

	•	Constant, eerie grin — like it was glued on

	•	Always wears business-casual: pastel shirt, khakis, and a nametag that says *“Hello! I’m Listening”*

	•	Moves silently, but always appears right behind you at the worst possible moment

  


Signature Weapon:

	•	A weaponized *“icebreaker kit”* — deploys things like forced handshakes, name games, or “fun facts” that explode into soul-crushing awkwardness

	•	His ultimate move is the Empathy Mirror: a device that forces you to endure *how others perceive you* in excruciating, real-time projection

  


Personality:

	•	Speaks only in HR-approved phrases: *“Let’s circle back,” “It’s giving… not a team player,”* and *“We’re all in this together!”*

	•	Cannot tolerate silence longer than three seconds

	•	Punishes deviations from “positive workplace culture” with a weaponized smile and mandatory coffee chat

  


Quirks:

	•	If you show emotional distress, he offers *“a wellness webinar”* instead of help

	•	Refers to all neurodivergent characters as “having some feedback to work through”

  


Catchphrase:

*“You don’t need to be fixed — you just need to fit in.”*

  


Scene Example:

Bond is hiding in a sensory-friendly safe room when Smiley walks in, clapping rhythmically and announcing:

  


“Hey there, superstar! Just wanted to touch base about your tone in yesterday’s life-or-death chase.”

  


Then he triggers a trap that forces Bond to participate in a group improv exercise, surrounded by mirrors and fluorescent lights.

# Best Gable table Legs 2025: Top Picks & Buying Guide

Gable table legs have risen in popularity over the past few years, becoming a staple for DIY enthusiasts and professional furniture makers alike. These legs, distinguished by their unique A-frame design, offer a blend of stability, style, and versatility. In 2025, the market is filled with various options, each catering to different needs and aesthetic preferences. Deciding on the best option can be complex.

This guide aims to simplify the selection process by highlighting the top gable table legs available in 2025, analyzing their key features, and providing valuable insights to help you make an informed decision. Whether you're building a dining table, a coffee table, or a desk, this guide will equip you with the knowledge to choose the perfect gable table legs for your project.

## Key Features Analysis

The quality and performance of gable table legs are determined by several key features,including material,dimensions,weight capacity,finish,adjustability,and installation method. A thorough understanding of these features is crucial for selecting the right legs for your specific needs.

**Material:** The material from which gable table legs are constructed considerably impacts their durability, stability, and aesthetic appeal.

Steel is a popular choice due to its strength and resistance to bending or breaking. Steel legs are often powder-coated to prevent rust and corrosion, making them suitable for both indoor and outdoor use. Wood, especially hardwood like oak or maple, offers a warmer, more traditional look. Wooden legs can be stained or painted to match any décor. Aluminum provides a lightweight yet sturdy option, ideal for projects where portability is a concern. Each material brings its own advantages,so matching the material to the intended use and aesthetic is key.

**Dimensions:** Gable table legs are available in a range of heights and widths to accommodate different table sizes and styles.

The height of the legs will determine the overall height of your table, so it's meaningful to choose legs that are appropriate for the intended use. Common heights range from 16 inches for coffee tables to 28-30 inches for dining tables and desks. The width of the legs affects their stability and visual appearance. Wider legs generally provide more stability but can also appear bulkier.Consider the proportions of your tabletop when selecting the dimensions of your gable table legs to ensure a balanced and aesthetically pleasing design.

**Weight Capacity:** The weight capacity of gable table legs indicates the maximum load they can safely support.

This is a critical factor, especially for larger tables or those intended to hold heavy items. ensure that the chosen legs have a sufficient weight capacity to support your tabletop and anything you plan to place on it. Overloading the legs can lead to instability, damage, or even collapse. Reputable manufacturers should provide clear weight capacity ratings for their products. When calculating, remember to include the weight of the tabletop itself.

**Finish:** The finish of gable table legs contributes to their overall appearance and resistance to wear and tear.

Powder coating is a popular option for metal legs, providing a durable, scratch-resistant finish in a variety of colors. Brushed or polished finishes offer a sleek, modern look. Wooden legs can be stained, painted, or varnished to achieve the desired color and sheen. The finish should complement the style of your tabletop and other furniture in the room and offer sufficient protection against moisture, scratches, and other potential damage.

**Adjustability:** Some gable table legs offer adjustable feet, allowing you to level your table on uneven surfaces.

This is a particularly useful feature for tables that will be placed on floors that are not perfectly level.Adjustable feet can also help to prevent wobbling and ensure that your table is stable and safe to use. Check the range of adjustability to ensure that it meets your needs.

**Installation Method:** The ease of installation is an important consideration for DIY projects.most gable table legs are designed to be attached to the tabletop using screws or bolts. Some legs may come with pre-drilled holes or mounting plates to simplify the process. Consider the type of tabletop you are using and the tools you have available when choosing gable table legs. Ensure that the legs come with clear instructions and all the necessary hardware for installation.

## Core Benefits

Gable table legs offer a range of benefits that make them a popular choice for furniture projects. Their unique design provides enhanced stability, a stylish aesthetic, and versatility for different table types.

**Enhanced Stability:** The A-frame design of gable table legs provides exceptional stability compared to traditional straight legs.

The angled support structure distributes weight evenly, reducing the risk of wobbling or tipping. This is particularly beneficial for larger tables or those intended to hold heavy objects. The stability offered by gable table legs ensures a safe and reliable surface for dining, working, or other activities. This robust design minimizes movement,even with uneven weight distribution.

**Stylish Aesthetic:** Gable table legs add a touch of modern elegance to any table.

Their distinctive A-frame shape creates a visually appealing focal point and complements a variety of design styles,from minimalist to industrial. The clean lines and geometric form of gable table legs can elevate the look of your table and make it a standout piece in your home. They offer a refreshing alternative to conventional table leg designs, adding visual interest and sophistication.

**Versatility:** Gable table legs can be used for a wide range of table types, including dining tables, coffee tables, desks, and side tables.

They are available in various sizes, materials, and finishes to suit different needs and preferences. Whether you are building a rustic farmhouse table or a sleek modern desk, gable table legs can provide the perfect combination of style and functionality. Their adaptability makes them a popular choice for both DIY projects and professional furniture design. They can seamlessly integrate into diverse interior designs.

**Space Saving design:** Due to the angled construction, gable legs often protrude less at the floor than traditional straight legs, leading to space saved around the table.

This can be very beneficial in smaller rooms where every inch matters. The unique A-frame design can offer an advantage when maneuvering chairs or walking around the furniture, preventing the awkward bumping into legs when in tight spaces.

## FAQs Section

Choosing the right gable table legs can raise several questions. Here are some frequently asked questions to address common concerns:

**Are gable table legs suitable for outdoor use?**
The suitability of gable table legs for outdoor use depends on the material and finish.Steel legs with a powder-coated finish are generally more resistant to rust and corrosion than other materials. Wood legs should be treated with a weather-resistant sealant or finish to protect them from moisture and UV damage. Always check the manufacturer's recommendations to ensure that the legs are appropriate for outdoor conditions.

**How do I determine the correct size of gable table legs for my project?**
The correct size of gable table legs depends on the intended use of the table and the size of the tabletop. For dining tables, a height of 28-30 inches is typically recommended. Coffee tables usually require legs that are 16-18 inches tall. Measure your tabletop and consider the desired overall height of the table when selecting the size of your gable table legs. Ensure that the width of the legs is proportionate to the size of the tabletop for a balanced aesthetic.**What type of tabletop is best suited for gable table legs?**
Gable table legs are compatible with a wide range of tabletop materials, including wood, metal, glass, and stone.The best type of tabletop depends on your personal preferences and the overall style you are trying to achieve. wood tabletops provide a warm, traditional look, while glass tabletops offer a sleek, modern aesthetic. Ensure that the tabletop is strong enough to support the weight of the items you plan to place on the table.

**How do I attach gable table legs to a tabletop?**
The attachment method depends on the design of the legs and tabletop. Most gable table legs can be attached using screws or bolts. Pre-drilled holes or mounting plates can simplify the installation process. Use appropriate screws or bolts for the type of tabletop material you are using. Follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully to ensure a secure and stable attachment. It may be necessary to pre-drill pilot holes in the tabletop to prevent splitting or damage.
