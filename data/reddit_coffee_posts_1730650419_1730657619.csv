1git7ml,https://www.reddit.com/r/ParisTravelGuide/comments/1git7ml/another_paris_trip_recap_end_of_oct_based_next_to/,"Another Paris Trip Recap (end of Oct, based next to Panthéon) ","Bonjour à tous,

I know there are a lot of trip reports, but selfishly, I wanted to relive our recent trip -- and hopefully some tidbits are of interest to anyone planning their own. We learned a lot from reading other reports here.

**Where We Stayed**

We stayed at Hôtel Les Dames du Panthéon, which is next to the monument on Place du Panthéon. Used Hyatt points to book -- not an exceptional redemption, but we liked the less corporate vibes. Kind of quirky decorations and our room had a view of the monument out all the windows.

The area is lively with lots of students. We even ran into what I can only describe as a mini-concert by what looked an American style marching band (still no idea who they were or what the deal was, but it was fun to see!)

There is a stretch of bars and restaurants around Rue Descartes/one end of Rue Mouffetard that was buzzing at night. Crêperie Pinocchio, a casual stand run by a delightful older couple, was awesome -- recommend grabbing a snack there if you're in the area.

A few other neighborhood places we really liked were:

* The Crêperie on Rue Soufflot -- kind of a local diner vibe
* La Bonbonnière just off Rue Saint-Jacques, which is a fun sort of combo coffee shop/bar/restaurant. They have a burger in a baguette that's great.
* Boulangerie Moderne Rabineau was excellent. It's apparently a part of the show Emily in Paris, and you can tell the staff is a little weary of all the tourists, but the food is worth it. 

It was also nice to be a short walk from Jardin Luxembourg and Blvd. Saint Michel (and the Latin Quarter more broadly). Some people might prefer being right in the middle of a neighborhood, but it worked pretty well for us. I also wish there were more Metro stops nearby, but it's well-connected by bus.

**Transportation**

The City Mapper app was helpful for navigating the bus routes and we used it a lot. It shows you wait times, all the stops along the way, your progress in real time, and even pings you when it's almost time to get off.

Not surprisingly, we found the Metro to be better for longer distances, late at night, and often during rush hour. But overall we liked traveling by bus -- all of them were quiet and clean. It wasn't difficult to figure out.

**Activities**

We visited most of the common tourist sites, which are discussed extensively here, but just a few thoughts:

* Loved the view from the top of the Arc de Triomphe. We went at night and using the Museum Pass to skip the huge line was awesome. Would have missed our dinner reservation without it.
* It was very relaxing to walk around Cimetière du Père-Lachaise. We found the old/historical grave sites to be super interesting, even without any sort of guidance. Took a quick Metro ride to Belleville for bahn mi afterwards, which was a really nice little excursion.
* Did one of the pricier Seine cruises with Le Calife. Thought it was worth it in every way; it was like a genuinely nice restaurant floating along at night. Great vantage point for the tower sparkling. Our favorite part was actually people watching from the window -- some fun glimpses of everyday life and locals enjoying the evening.
* We did one of the bike tours at Versailles through Blue Fox. Had a wonderful time overall and the system of doing the main palace last was a good one. The sunset light in the Hall of Mirrors was an unexpected and beautiful little moment. Our two minor critiques were: 1. We wished we had just a little more time before it closed and 2. We didn't have the wherewithal to piece together a full lunch during the market stop. It felt kind of complicated, so we opted for a bakery sandwich and another pastry instead.
* Enjoyed the walking tour of Montmartre through Paris Walks, but I think any company would have been fine. It was nice to do a winding, gradual stroll up to the basilica.

**More Food Thoughts**

* Fine Dining: We splurged on a meal at Restaurant Alan Geeam near the Arc. It's French-Lebanese cuisine and it was incredible. Small, intimate place and all the flavors were off the charts, including lobster tail they cooked in a spice blend that's more commonly used in Middle Eastern chicken dishes. Not cheap -- the tasting menu we chose was 150 euros each, not including drinks -- but it was a blast.
* Le Marais: Had a great lunch at the bistro L'Ange20 -- one of our best meals. The ""duck two ways"" was my favorite. Also the best onion soup we had.
* 6th: We stumbled upon a new French-Moroccan restaurant called Le Dima right by the Rennes Metro stop (not sure what neighborhood this is, exactly). It had great reviews on Google and we were hungry. Everything was \*really\* good, especially the goat cheese millefeuille appetizer.
* Montmartre: The bakery Le Grenier à Pain was the true standout of our morning. Worth a stop.
* Belleville: Would definitely recommend the bahn mi place we tried, Saigon Sandwich. Grab and go style. We walked to the park to eat, which was fine, although nothing truly special. 
* Versailles: We had good cocktails at Les Badauds before getting on the train home. The snacks were just ok, but this place was absolutely hopping (in a good way) and it was nice to hit a non-touristy spot.

Anyway, hopefully this was helpful to someone. Enjoy your travels!",1,1730657547.0,ParisTravelGuide,0,1.0,False

**Memory Transcription Subject: Cruth, Krev ex-Exchange Program Participant.**

Date \[*Standardized human time*\]: April 3, 2160

I only had concern for the poor primate making his way upstairs, from the way he was sobbing and clutching to me like I was the only thing he had, left me heart broken. Watching him cry made my heart sinch in my chest, no one should have to be like that, no one deserves that. When he started talking about the incident I was expecting some sort of altercation between workers, just, not that. I turned my attention away from the stairwell the primate disappeared up and turned to Breeve who was now sitting in the reclining chair with her holo pad in claw.

‘Has this happened before? She knew what to do immediately when she came running down the stairs.’

“Do you know what happened to Eward?”

The tour guide placed the pad on the table in front of her and turned to look at me directly.

“Yeah, I found out about it when we were travelling here, he’s shared a few small details here and there. I thought talking about it would help him some and try to lessen the burden on him, but maybe it wasn’t enough.”

Breeve had started to flick her claws against each other before reaching over the side of her chair and grabbing the human’s head wear and started pawing at it not really doing anything of note. I guess she’s nervous to talk about it. We sat in silence for a moment before I asked.

“How did it happen? How did you see it start on the train?”

“We were sharing a bunk room on the train; he had already fallen asleep before I entered the room. I was scrolling through news and social media because I wasn’t that tired, he-umm. I started to hear him saying something in his sleep and rustling before he started screaming.”

When she spoke, she was looking at the hat and kept fiddling with it.

“How did you calm him down? It looked like you knew what to do when you came running around the corner.”

“Umm… I-uhh.”

She took a breath to steady herself before continuing and focused intently on the hat and had stopped looking at me. Why was she hesitant to talk about how to help Edward? I would need to know since he’s most likely going to stay here for a while, I would rather he not have a miserable stay without any sleep.

“When he was screaming, I just started to hug him and say that everything’s alright. I didn’t know it was trauma at first until he started listing off names of people I never heard of, I thought it was humans injured in the explosion I read about, but it was his friends that had died in it.”

I felt a pit in my stomach hearing the word ‘died’, how could this sort of thing happen to the cute primates. It shouldn’t have happened at all, Edward said he was a miner in the colony, and it was a drill explosion. Was this caused by us forcing them to pay for their stay on Tellus?

“I-is this our fault?” I asked Breeve.

“Oh, no no, I’ve asked him as such, and he said that it wasn’t completely anyone’s fault.”

“We’re partially to blame?”

“Sort of, but I do know that he doesn’t blame us for it.”

I was starting to think of ways to help our human friend with his troubles, I would much rather focus on that instead of my own. If we could get in contact with the exchange or maybe some humans on Tellus, we could get contact information of a few of his friends to talk about it and find out what to do. Another way we could do this is by going to a therapist, I know one in Bulik we could go and see.

“Did he wake up again after you calmed him down? Or did he stay awake and not sleep for a while?”

I could see the tour guide turn away as her face seemed to turn a little shade of blue, what could be so embarrassing? I could only imagine that they slept together or something along those lines. The tour guide turned back after rubbing at her face and started to explain.

“I-we-umm. I asked if he wanted to- uhh hug, while he slept, th-that way he maybe wouldn’t have another nightmare.”

I watched as the tour guide’s face became more and more blue as she stumbled over her words about hugging Edward while they slept. I didn’t understand, I would love the opportunity to cuddle with the human, they are so cute its not funny. That little boopable nose and tickling their fingers or ruffling their hair. I think that I should ask if I had the opportunity if he’ll let me.

“Alright, so, you were able to keep him calm by hugging him. Was he alright with this arrangement?”

Breeve sighed and visibly relaxed that I wasn’t teasing her or acting weird about the whole thing. She settled back into her chair and kept fiddling with the hat.

“Yeah, he was alright with it, both on the train and the night after.”

I am unbelievably jealous right now, not only was she able to cuddle the human but was able to do it twice. Makes me want to ask if it would be alright if I cuddled with him, to make sure that he was alright of course.

“Do you think he would allow me to cuddle him as well?”

“I don’t see why not.”

Thinking a about how to ask Edward if he would be alright with that made me somewhat embarrassed about broaching the topic, but I would ask him later, right now we needed to think of different ways besides cuddles that could help him.

“Breeve, since your contracted by the exchange, do you have any contacts you could call and maybe ask for information we could use to help Edward, or maybe talk to some of his friends that are still alive and ask them how to help him?”

“I expect that we’ll be getting call form the overseer Exal soon anyway, I’ll give them a call when I get some free time and see what I could do. Edward and I weren’t able to get your contact information because of data protection, but I think she’ll help us when I tell her Edward might have some trauma related to the incident.”

Hearing the name Exal again made me a little angry seeing that she didn’t try and fight to have me still on the program even after the false allegations were dropped. Thinking about it more though, she did allow Edward to come find me and gave him my address at risk to her own job, so maybe she wasn’t so bad.

Before I could voice anymore thoughts about the subject, I heard a door upstairs click shut and the thumping footsteps of our primate friend coming downstairs to join us. He rounded the corner, and his head of hair looked like it was soaked and dried with a towel, the puffiness in his eyes that I saw earlier had faded somewhat but it still made me worry about him. Breeve spoke first.

“Edward, are you alright?”

“Yeah, feeling a lot better than before. Needed that shower more than I thought, I feel like a new man.”

I was a little sceptical of what he said, the white around his pupils had a red tint to it like he had got soap in them or something, but I didn’t bring it up not wanting the human to focus on what happened again.

“Hey, you guys want to get breakfast somewhere? I was thinking about seeing the differences about our cafes compared to your own. I’ll pay for it of course, my treat.”

“Alright then.”

“If you’re buying sure.”

Me and Breeve voiced our approval, I had the mental image of a bunch of humans shouting ‘cuppa’ looking for some tea flash through my mind. I got up from the couch and made my way over to a mirror to see if I looked alright, I hadn’t gone out in a long time, let alone to a café in maybe months. I looked pretty decent which I chalked up to having a decent night’s sleep for once.

The other two had finished their preparations as well, Breeve just needed to go and grab her bag and Edward needed to wear his sunglasses and hat, I think he said it was to protect his eyesight from the brightness of the sun. I felt a little sad that he had to hide his eyes and hair away from us, it was cute to look at. With that I grabbed my bag, and we started out the front door while I closed and locked it behind us. The sun was far into the sky by this point as we started our walk.

“So, do you know any good spots about?”

Edward asked me as we were walking, I was already heading in the direction of a place I had visited in the past.

“Yeah, we’re already heading there now, it’s a little bit of a walk since it’s in town, but it’s a good spot from what I can remember.”

We walked for a while passing by other Krev out doing what ever they need to today, I couldn’t help but notice that as we passed them, they would turn their head to stare at Edward, some would go as far as to stop and stare at us. It made me worry a bit because of the attention we were receiving even though we were still on the outskirts of town.

“Hey, did you see them staring at you?” I whispered to the human.

“Oh that? Yeah, I’ve had Krev staring at me for the past few days constantly, I got used to it. Reminds me, Breeve, you remember Issac and Lufti, yeah?”

The tour guide turned her focus from our surroundings to the human and replied.

“Yes, what about them? Did something happen?”

“No nothing serious, I saw that they opened a café in Winthome, I think Issac is doing well with crowds now because he’s manning the front counter with a huge line.”

I could see the tour guide perk up at hearing about these two, they said they opened a café on Winthome, that was on the orbital ring. Just how far did they travel just to see me?

“That’s good to hear, I was wondering whatever happened to them, I’m glad that they’re doing alright now. Last time we saw them Issac wasn’t doing too good.”

I was feeling a little out of the loop on who these Issac and Lufti were

“Hey, umm, who are those guys you’re talking about?”

“It’s an exchange pair we had the pleasure of meeting on the way here, we travelled with them for a short while before parting ways at Winthome.” Edward replied.

I remembered a video I had seen of two humans standing on a station platform waiting for a train going to Winthome. Was that Edward and Breeve I saw?

“Were you guys getting on a train heading to Winthome with another exchange duo?”

“Yeah, why do you ask?”

“I saw a video of you guys helping them out, it was plastered all over social media. The post was locked due to the number of comments it was getting on media platforms.”

“I never thought that you guys had that much of an obsession with us, it’s honestly a little creepy.”

As we walked and talked, we had made it into the town and started to see more Krev foot traffic, they would stop and stare more regularly and some even pulled out a pad to take a photo or video of us walking by. It made me feel extremely uncomfortable with all the stares, luckily, we were nearing our destination. The café had a glass door you needed to push to open, with a large glass front with the name engraved into it.

“This is us here.”

I said to them as I opened the glass door for the two to step in. The café was an alright size being able to seat about thirty Krev comfortably and it seemed that it was slow at the moment. We made our way to the counter with a rather youngish looking Krev taking orders while another was working to make drinks behind them. They were staring at Edward standing behind me and failed to notice me trying to place an order.

“Umm excuse me.”

I said politely trying to get the barista’s attention, I saw them do a double take turning to me then Edward and back to me before saying.

“Oh, I’m terribly sorry. Can I assume that you two and the ador- the prett- the human are all together.”

“Yes, we are.”

“Okay, what are your orders then?”

“I’ll have a Rily brew what about yourselves?”

I said turning to the other two

“I’ll have a Larice.” Breeve said

“Do you have any sort of coffee substitute, y’ know like, high in caffeine.”

The barista was at a loss for a moment before recommending.

“How about a Carks drink, it’s high in caffeine and it’s not a cold drink either.”

“Yeah sure, I’ll have that and a three of those buns you have there on display if they’re available.”

The krev rung up the price using a till and Edward paid for our drinks.

“You guys can go and sit down somewhere, and we’ll bring your drinks over.”

With that done I sighed before making our way over to a table next to the window. Edward sat on the inside while Breeve took the seat next to him and I sat opposite them. From here we would be able to watch as people walked by, I could see the barista give our order to the Krev making the drinks and they turned to see where we were sitting and then looked back to what they were doing.

“Did you see the way that guy was looking at you?” Breeve asked Edward.

“Yeah, I did, you’d think that I was some sort of monster, they stuttered their words and couldn’t focus properly.”

“It wasn’t that they looked like they wanted to take you home as a pet or something. You could see the way their face scrunched up like they were trying to hold back an aww.” Breeve explained.

I saw that the other Krev sitting in the café had turned an ear to listen to us, while the amount of Krev waiting in the line had almost doubled since we had entered the cafe. I was still a bit concerned about the amount of attention we were receiving.

“Guys, you might want to keep your voices down a bit, look there are a few listening to us.”

Edward turned his head to view the room and saw that a few of the Krev were staring back at him, they made a gesture trying to get his attention as he turned his head.

“Yeah, I think that would be best.”

It wasn’t long before our orders arrived, the barista at the counter was still taking orders from various Krev and the one delivering our items was the Krev who was making the drinks. They placed the tray on the table without much fanfare, but they did linger for longer than I thought was necessary while staring at the human. I was glad that Breeve was between them, it looked like the Krev may jump at the human to pet him.

“Thank you kindly.” I heard Edward say before the barista left.

I took a sip of my tea while Breeve had a chilled drink and Edward took a tentative sip of his own before putting the steaming cup back on the table, I was worried because he scrunched his face when he took a sip, he may have burned his tongue if he wasn’t careful.

“That’s some strong coffee right there.”

“It has one of the highest caffeine contents you can get here, it’ll definitely wake you up if you’re tired.” I told Edward.

“Yeah, I’ve tried Carks myself when I was studying for exams back in school, it got me through a lot of late nights with studying and essays.”

“The coffee ran out after a few years for us, we’ve had to make do with what we had when underground.”

While Edward had been telling us about what they used for coffee, I had noticed that the Krev that had their orders taken seated themselves near our table. The seats were choked full of Krev and a few of them were glancing at Edward every now and then.

“You know what this reminds me of?” Breeve asked

“What?”

“The first time we met, remember back on Tellus. They had a similar set up with the tables and chairs, the people there had surrounded the few humans in the room by sitting near them.”

“You know, it does, but I think I’m a little outnumbered with this one.”

Edward bit into the sweet roll he had ordered and munched away at it, I could hear a few Krev let out a trill noise at the site of him eating. This is ridiculous getting, are we really this bad at hiding our emotions. It’s not like it wasn’t cute or adorable, it’s just that reaction was a little over the top.

We sipped away at our drinks and ate the sweet rolls; I was looking out of the window at the growing crowd of people outside trying to get into the café. The staff had increased from two to four and then to six from the volume of Krev entering the place. No doubt because of the presence of the human in the place.

“Cruth, you alright?” Edward asked.

“Yeah, why do you ask?”

“You keep looking around the place and have a worried look on your face.”

“Is it really that obvious.”

“Very.” Breeve added while munching on a sweet roll.

“I’m not to great with crowds, too many faces and people moving, it makes me worried in case I might get swept up in it.”

“Say the word and we’re leaving; I don’t want you to feel anxious or worry about stuff.”

“Thank you, but let’s finish our food first before leaving.”

Today, we’re diving into the fascinating world of internet bravery , or, as I like to call it, “Keyboard Courage Syndrome.” You know who I’m talking about , the people who are *bold* as hell on [C.ai](http://C.ai) but wouldn’t dare order a coffee without stuttering in real life.

Picture this: On [C.ai](http://C.ai) they’re talking to an AI like it’s their arch-nemesis or their long-lost lover. They’re out there throwing down savage insults, planning world domination, or, let’s be honest, having conversations that would make their grandma faint. These are the same people who, in the real world, couldn’t win an argument with a parking meter.

They’re talking all that smack to bots online, typing stuff like, “You think you can talk to ME like that? You don’t even know who you’re dealing with.” Meanwhile, in real life, they get startled if someone says “hi” too enthusiastically at the grocery store. Bold online, but the second a real person makes eye contact, they’re suddenly experts at making awkward small talk about the weather.

  
I mean, it’s amazing how these people (I’m also those people ✌️😔) of the web transform into social awkwardness. They’ll leave savage messages to an AI, like, “I’d destroy you in two seconds.” But in reality, they’re the ones who apologize when someone steps on *their* foot.

So, here’s my theory: C,Ai  is therapy for the secretly timid. They get to play out their fantasies of being bold, bossy, or even downright terrifying, and it’s harmless fun… until they remember they have to leave the house.

So if you, too, are a brave soul on [C.ai](http://C.ai) , keep enjoying that keyboard courage. But remember, folks — the internet might think you’re a badass, but don’t be afraid to bring some of that confidence out into the real world. After all, the only thing scarier than real people… is realizing you’ve been talking actual person and not to a bot this whole time.

Some saying the fatigue and depression is lasting for months on end. It especially depends on how high your intake was, how your lifestyle is, etc. This is not meant to invalidate any of those experiences, but rather provide an alternative narrative for people daunted by the leap to a caffeine-free life.

I've been drinking caffeine heavily since 12 years old (and recently learned that it was probably self-medicating for ADHD). I tapered down from my 4-5 cups a day to one cup over 2 weeks (probably a bit quick, but I was eager and saw a lull in my workload that would allow for some withdrawal). Then, I stopped.

Nights 1-4, I couldn't sleep well and kept waking up to nightmares. On caffeine, I averaged around 6-7 hours of sleep/night and sleeping ""a lot"" was getting 8 hours of sleep. Plus, I would never sleep past 9 o'clock, usually waking up naturally between 7 and 8. However, past those first few restless, decaffineated nights, I started to *sleep* sleep. I slept 10-11 hours some nights. It was insane. I would feel groggy in the morning, but way more steady throughout the day. This means I started sleeping to (or past!!) my alarm, which I never used to do.

Over the first 2 weeks, I was extremely depressed and dark thoughts loomed heavy in my head. I would spend evenings laying on my couch just waiting for bedtime, unable to nap, brooding. I felt so defeated (and the headaches were no help). I felt an all-encompassing exhuastion all the time. Almost missed a few deadlines and missed more than a few emails on account of the brain fog. I would read about people having this feeling for months, and that just made me even more depressed and disheartened.

However as I transitioned into the third week, things started to click into place. My moods were more stable and my anxiety plummeted. When problems arise I feel much more level-headed and I've surprised myself by the calmness with which I resolve conflict. I don't feel that exhilirating burst of energy and afternoon crash anymore. My usual afternoon slump has disappeared, and I feel like I have enough steady energy to make it through the day. My sleep has consistently clocked-in around 8-9 hours a night (sometimes 10), and it takes me just a few minutes to fall asleep.

I'm more in-tune with my body now. On caffeine, I would just choose when I thought bedtime was and wait for sleep to take me. Now, though, I feel my sleep and am able to let my body guide me to bed when it needs.

Some honest thoughts: I sometimes miss the feeling of alertness and high-energy baseline (my productivity has admittedly gone down). My adhd symptoms have gotten noticeably worse, and it's harder for me to focus for longer periods of time or be as still as social convention wants me to be. I have had cravings since stopping  (mostly for a smoke, though, which is weird, since it's been so long). The cravings for coffee were the worst within the first week.

Some unexpected positives: After getting over the first few days of bad sleep, I started having dreams! On caffeine, I would have the occasional dream (maybe one every 1-2 weeks), and I would only be able to remember a few images, if anything from it. Now, though, I can have multiple dreams a night that are vivid and entire! This means my REM cycles have been doing their thing, and I've actually really enjoyed this development. It's entertaining and inspiring for my creative pursuits. It has even helped me understand my waking relationships and situations better.

Also a pleasant surprise past the second week, my libido went up and my orgasms are wayyyy better. I feel like new! And the last thing I was not expecting: I've had a few nights of <5 hours of sleep since stopping, and the feeling of sleep deprivation is  completely different. On caffeine, sleep deprivation felt like a waking nightmare; I would feel physically sick, incredibly anxious, I would not be able to function at all. However, now it just feels kinda slow. I can still get things done, it just takes a little longer. No more physical sickness about it either. And I catch up on sleep deprivation with no problem (on caffeine, my body could never sleep more to ""make up"" for the lost sleep).

Anyway, I just wanted to give people a different perspective. I'm so glad I made this choice!",1,1730657039.0,decaf,0,1.0,False
1git0ap,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1git0ap,Is my Itinerary Realistic?,"Help! We’re going to Disneyland on some of the busiest days of the year. We’re going for 3 days.

But it’s my husband and daughter’s first trip and we’re taking my older mom and her husband. I want to take our time, hit all the must sees, and stop to take in the magic and see all the characters my daughter wants.

I’m not a bartender though I’d love to learn but it’s not actual bartending — it’s wine-based alternatives, though the sort of the same concept and a foot in the door for bartending. Unfortunately the hours are between 7am-4:30pm.

I work for Marriott as an F&B supervisor in Coffee. I’m crossed trained in both our coffee outlets & our pool bar/grill, but I focus mostly in coffee outlets. Hours have been cut due to off season so I haven’t been able to continue working in the other outlets. I’ve dabbled a little in bartending, know the basics but I don’t consider myself a bartender. i would love to switch over to bartending altogether because it will open up more opportunities for me. I have great benefits and love working here, so my hotel is my priority. With holiday season approaching, I know I will be working more. 

Overall, I make more at the hotel compared to the restaurant. My manager is flexible, so I could give my Sundays and Saturdays to the restaurant but they’re only considering if I can do 4 days a week. I don’t want another full time job, just a little extra cash & experience. How can I go about this without losing the opportunity?

1gisw0n,https://www.reddit.com/r/TerraKaffe/comments/1gisw0n/t2_newbie_issuesobservations/,T-2 Newbie Issues/Observations,"Hi folks. Our T-2 arrived earlier this year and we’ve been slow to adopt it. Overall, it seems to be a little more work than we anticipated, but we’re attempting to power through. Previously, we were Nespresso users and absolutely loved our machines (we had several in different parts of the house). Not sure if it’s a learning curve, but right now, I’m sorta wishing we had stuck with them versus buying the T-2.

A few issues/observations below. I’m sure none of this is new news to those of you who are veterans.

- There is no warning to indicate beans are low or out. This is hugely frustrating as we’ve been unpleasantly surprised a few times. Hard to believe this function was overlooked in testing given it all starts with the beans. 

- On the beans topic: Would love to see a small hopper for decaf option. There’s no way to tell if the existing one is empty (or manually empty it), so I risk making a drink with both - which presents a series health concern for some guests who absolutely can’t have caffeine. I sometimes also like a 1/2 caf/ 1/2 decaf and this isn’t really an option either. 

- The drip tray and milk container not being dishwasher safe. Just a pain overall. It’s also hard to get all of the crevices in the tray clean. I don’t mind emptying it several times a day but the extra step to hand wash is annoying. Kind of goes against the whole idea of convenience.

- I accidentally left it on a clean prompt last night. It did not reset or go into sleep cycle and was super hot to the touch this morning when I went to make my first cup of coffee. Again, seems like a missed opportunity not to just have it power down after x hours of no use. (This specifically pertains to it being in a clean prompt. I know it will go to sleep otherwise with no use.)

- One side of the spout sprays and/or dribbles a shot. From what I’ve read here, it may be clogged so I’ll attempt to clean it and see if there’s improvement. I’m never sure if I’m getting an actual full shot, and ’m constantly wiping up around the countertop. Also frustrating that it hasn’t had a lot of use and this is already occurring. 

- Why the limits on shots for custom drinks? For example, I like my morning cappuccino with 5 shots but the machine will only let me program it for up to three. I work around it by adding two espresso shots before brewing the cap, but this is time consuming and could be avoided if the user was able to input their desired number of shots (or amount of milk) versus selecting from the pre-programmed menu. 

- It’s loud which is usually not a huge deal unless I’m trying to be quiet in the morning or on a video call. I was making a presentation to a rather large group recently and the machine went into clean mode. I had to offer apologies for the noise and that was embarrassing. 

- It‘s rather large and takes up a bit of counter space. Initially this wasn’t a big deal, but as time passes I can’t help but think there’s opportunity here. 

- As others have pointed out here, none of the drinks (or milk) get super hot. I had the same issue with our Nespresso machines, but I was hoping for a better experience with the T-2.

So, the jury is still out for me. Don’t love it but don’t hate it either. Perhaps I had unrealistic expectations given the hype and price point. 

Appreciate any advice. TIA

1gisult,https://www.reddit.com/r/RelationshipIndia/comments/1gisult/moments_and_milestones_tracking_our_33m_and_31f/,Moments and Milestones: Tracking Our (33M and 31F) Journey from ‘Aww’ to ‘OMG’,"So my wife (31) and I (33) are about to celebrate our 4th anniversary, and instead of going with the usual gifts, we decided to create something truly meaningful—a “Relationship Guidebook” called Moments and Milestones. It’s more than just a scrapbook; it’s a collection of all our quirks, inside jokes, and the little rules that make us, us. Plus, it’s our way of looking back at how our relationship has evolved, with each year adding something new to our story. Here’s a sneak peek into what’s inside:

1. Chronicles of Chaos and Cuddle: This section is basically our “relationship bloopers.” We’ve got stories like The Great Wedding Season Survival, where we somehow managed to attend five family weddings in ten days and emerged with only mild trauma (and a serious mithai overdose). Then there’s The Great Bargain Hunt Disaster, where we went street shopping and tried out-bargaining each other, only to come home with an assortment of bizarre, useless things. And, of course, The ‘Ek Aur Episode’ Binge, that legendary night we promised to watch “just one episode” and ended up binging an entire season, stumbling into work the next day on zero sleep and way too much coffee.

2. Where We Have Left Pieces of Our Hearts: This is our map of relationship landmarks—the little places where our story unfolded. There’s The Great ‘Family Get-Together’ Venue, where we had our first big family dinner after getting engaged and tried balancing our “new couple” image while dodging endless rounds of questions from relatives. Then we have The Temple of Blessings and New Beginnings, where we went together after our wedding to seek blessings and officially start this journey. And, of course, The Secret Chaat Corner, a hidden gem for pani puri that’s technically “off-limits” (too spicy, too unhygienic—so they say!), but it’s our guilty pleasure date spot.

3. Quirky Code of Conduct: These are the “relationship rules” that keep us grounded—and laughing. We’ve got essentials like Never Eat the Last Bite Without Permission (a strict one), No Netflix Cheating (watching an episode solo is a capital offense), and The Compliment Swap Rule (every sarcastic comment must be followed by an overly dramatic compliment).

4. The “Best of Us” Awards: Our version of the Oscars! Here we’ve given each other awards like Champion of Bed Hogging (for the one who takes up all the bed space), Late-Night Snack Chef Extraordinaire (for the best—and weirdest—2 AM food creations), Most Likely to Start a Pillow Fight (for the one who can’t resist turning any cuddle session into a full-blown pillow war), and Official Family Late Latif (for the one who somehow manages to be “fashionably late” no matter the occasion).

5. Phrasebook of Our Private Shenanigans: This is like a dictionary of our made-up language, filled with words and phrases only we get. There’s Chai-fi (our sacred chai-and-WiFi time), Operation ‘Cat Nap’ (the ongoing battle over who gets the blankets), and Houdini Time (when one of us “disappears” for a bit of solo recharge without any warning).

6. Ridiculous Vows That Somehow Matter: Not your usual wedding vows! We’ve got promises like I Promise to Always Laugh at Your Jokes (Even the Bad Ones) (because someone has to), I Vow to Protect Your Leftovers from My Midnight Hunger (unless they’re not clearly labeled), and I Swear I’ll ‘Let You Win’ Every Time at Chauka Bara (even if I know you’re definitely cheating).

7. Weird Things We’ll Definitely Do Someday: Our “bucket list” of things we’re determined to do together. This includes Do a Super Over-the-Top Couple Photoshoot with cheesy poses and props, Only Talk in Song Lyrics for a Day (extra points if they rhyme or make no sense!), and the Sappy Letters Hidden Challenge, where we write ridiculously over-the-top love letters and hide them in strange places to be discovered over time. It’s random, but it’s just us.

8. Encyclopedia of Us: 
Think of this as our version of Wikipedia—filled not with life accomplishments but with everyday quirks, strange habits, and those funny details only a partner would know. It’s our way of capturing how well we really know each other, while also seeing how our habits and little oddities change (or stay exactly the same) over time. From signature catchphrases to habits that just won’t budge, this “encyclopedia” is here to document it all. Here’s a glimpse into my entries on her:


A. Subtle Fun Facts:

- Human Meme Generator – Unintentionally pulls the perfect “meme face” for every fun or weird situation. It’s like a live meme reel, with expressions that capture each moment without her even realizing it.

- Accidental Comedian – She doesn’t even realize how funny she is. Her offhand comments turn into inside jokes that have us laughing for weeks.

- The Secret Song Sleuth – Knows random trivia or backstories about almost every song she listens to and will happily share them when a song plays.


B. Funny Habits:

- Game Night Mastermind – Gets ultra-competitive with board games, strategizing and trash-talking with zero mercy.

- Detective of Drama – Has an uncanny ability to pick up on even the tiniest bits of gossip or drama. It’s like she’s got a radar for anything juicy.

- The Car DJ – Takes over the music on every car ride, providing commentary for each song choice and why it’s just right for the drive.

- Outfit Overthinker – Spends ages deciding on an outfit, narrating her choices as if she’s curating an art exhibit.

C. Go-To Phrase: “Arre, yaar, trust me on this.” It’s her classic line, perfect for everything from “I have an actual foolproof plan” to “Let’s just wing it and hope for the best.” Somehow, it always works!

— The Soprano Sage: Being a huge Sopranos fan, she can pull out the perfect Tony Soprano line for any situation. Here are some of her go-tos:

- When she’s deep into chores or errands, sighing like Tony, “It’s like I’m runnin’ a freakin’ enterprise here!”

- When the last snack mysteriously disappears: “What can I say? I got appetites!”

- When she’s dishing out advice (or laying down the law): “You’re gonna take it like a man.”

- And when she’s setting down a plan she expects me to follow to the letter: “I give you an order, you follow it. Capisce?”

Creating this guidebook has been a hilarious and nostalgic journey, reminding us of all the quirks, chaos, and love that make our relationship special. More than anything, it’s become our way to track how we’re growing together and how our silly traditions keep evolving. If anyone has ideas for quirky additions, please share! This has been one of the most meaningful gifts we’ve given each other, and we’re so excited to see how it grows as we keep adding to it.

His sister (49f we will caller K) has been caring for her. Before all this happened K had talked their mom into kicking us out of a house that she had let us rent long story short none of us (B, my kids and myself 34f) have not talked to them in over two years. K got in touch with B which that’s fine I wasn’t the one that told them to stop talking B chose that on his own. Anyway she tells him his mom got sick. Again I don’t care what he decides to do with K and his mom I’m just there to support him ok. We end up going to the hospital where his mother is and he tells me this doesn’t change how she treated the kids and you. I said “fine i didn’t have to converse with her I’m not there for her I’m there for you and your mother.” So as we are there I’m standing listening to her talk and crap well the whole time not one thing was said about their mom. She was constantly asking my husband if he remembered this girl and that girl and don’t you remember you dated her. I wouldn’t feel so disrespected if she would have said guys names too. So I left and went down to the coffee shop. I came back up an hour later after I read some of my favorite book and drank my coffee. I return to the room and K is still on the remember this girl and that girl. So I left and met up with my mom and my kids. B got upset and you hear K say why did she leave that was rude. I said when you are ready to leave I will pick you up. I never argued back I didn’t even raise my voice to talk over K. B said ok I will call you when I’m ready I said ok and that was the end of that…… so I thought. Fast forward to two days later. They have moved my mother in law to another hospital and we went and saw her when she arrived just B and I. We are there and K is acting really weird and I couldn’t figure out why. Well turns out the nurse taking care of their mother is cousins to a girl in which K was sleeping with her husband. So she didn’t like the family needless to say. Well here she goes again she starts in B you remember this girl and that girl never once is a guys name mentioned. So I leave again and drive down to my cousins house. B calls and he asked again why I left and again K said I was rude. I said I will pick you up when you are ready. I did just that. I don’t have the heart to tell B why I left I don’t want to make things harder on him but I feel like K is being disrespectful when we are supposed to be there for their mom.

We want to replace all of the flooring. It is on a crawlspace. There is currently carpet and some junky plasticky flooring. We would prefer solid hardwood but may be open to engineered. We both hate the clickety clack of engineered wood and the thinner sound of walking on it and can somehow usually tell when it's engineered by looking at it. Love solid hardwood but it is a struggle to find samples in person or even find samples to ask the flooring places in town to order. We like white oak and walnut. Light or medium. Slightly warm. Not too yellow and definitely not too red. Not too contrasting grain. Like Select versus Character type looks. Popular stains we like are Provincial, Special Walnut, and maybe Coffee Brown.

In light of the post where everyone is fawning over the beer taps at the Rose Garden, let me say a few things:

I am not related to the person who ran the IG account, and it contains more of the owner’s highly troublesome allegations. However, it is an excellent place to start if you want to elaborate on what this man can do.

The owner is known for abusing women (both sexually and physically). If you don’t think that is enough, multiple people who used to work for him and sell wares in his shop also have been screwed over by the owner, who doesn’t seem to be very good with money and paying people their fair, deserved wages.

I don’t want to shame anyone, but I do want you all to consider that this man was very harmful and had to do a complete rebrand to stay afloat. I’m worried that he has pandered to people a decade or more younger to keep relevant (as they weren’t of age when he was causing hell for everyone). I also see that the general public might just think this is a hip little spot… so allow me to help you all.


List of businesses that you can support without supporting abusers:

Coffee:
Fidel & Co, Rivercity, Neverwhere (has comics and records!) 

Vintage:
Crying Weasel, Dog Eat Dog

So I started this book, (Addicted To My Father's Best Friend by Miranda West on JoyLit) and at first it made sense. Girl likes boy, it's forbidden, he don't know about it, someone finds out and tells him. That made sense. But this is where it gets confusing. The characters are Chloe and Bryan. Chloe is a 24 y/o woman and Bryan is her fathers best friend. Chloe has this secret crush on Bryan that she's had for years and Bryans ex girlfriend Eve finds out, goes into their house because Chloe is living with Bryan for some reason. She just moved in and is in a guest room. Anyway, Eve shows up, her and Bryan have a physical altercation, Eve tells him about Chloes feelings and then calls her a pervert, a whore, a pedophile, and a bunch of other words. Bryan thinks she's lying and so when Chloe tells him that she wasn't, he kicks her out. She ends up at a soup kitchen somehow, makes a friend, and thdn he texts her and asks her to go out to coffee with him and so she goes to her best friends, get's all dolled up, and then goes to the coffee shop. And this is where it gets even more confusing and bizarre. Eve is there, he asked Chloe to coffee so that he could reject her AGAIN, and then Eve tells her a story about when she went for an older man and it ended badly. And then Chloe leaves and reminisces on all these memories of kisses and hand holding and cuddling on the couch with Bryan and then Eve tells her that he's getting back with her(Eve) and that she(Chloe) needs to move on. And now the auther is sticking with the whole 'they were together the whole time' bit and it's driving me nuts! She ends up going on dates with other guys but then realizes that she's ""moving on"" wrong and talks to her dad about how they were real and had dreams. ",1,1730655802.0,literaturerants,0,1.0,False

That is never a good way to start the day. It wasn't very restful sleep cause I kept having very vivid nightmares which is also not unusual for me.

Went down stairs for some coffee and felt as if my bite was off. For those who don't know me I have TMD basically a joint disorder regarding my jaw that causes me to partially dislocate my jaw quite frequently. I don't end up with lock jaw which is good and it isn't as painful now but it still doesn't feel good when your teeth no longer line up properly. I wasn't sure at first that this was the case but I looked at my teeth using the camera on my phone and of course the bottom front teeth are way to far to the right side and not lining up at all with the top front teeth. Then when I opened my mouth it was very obvious that it was not tracking properly.

So I guess I'll be taking another fun trip to the chiropractor on Monday if they can fit me in. I thought getting a proper occlusal guard would help alleviate the problem but apparently that isn't the case. I spent $115 on that stupid piece of plastic. I'm tired so freaking tired of going to the chiropractor for a month and having my jaw finally be back in a normal position just for it to go back to being out of alignment less than a week later.

Being autistic and on SSDI with Medicare Advantage for insurance my options for proper treatment of this condition are often limited. I tried seeing if my dentist could help but they can not help/will not help. I don't really like my current dentist. I tried the oral surgeon at the in-network medical organization I normally go to for medical matters but they were too overbooked with appointments and it became apparent that they wouldn't be able to help me either.

I've been told by a TMJ physical therapist that I should pursue an EDS diagnosis because of my jaw issues but that seems to be the only joint I have regular issues with. So I really don't think that is the answer. 

It's really hard trying to figure out these medical abnormalities and how to fix them and which doctors I should be seeing regarding the issue. It leads to me feeling burntout and depressed. I don't really have any support regarding this matter and I just don't know what to do.

But anyways work today will be fun seeing as how I'm now dealing with my jaw being out of alignment and due to the discomfort of that my masking abilities aren't what they should be.

I'll just take the naproxen for my jaw and hope for the best I guess. What a great way to start off my day lol.",1,1730655667.0,AutisticAdults,0,1.0,False

*The path to Athos is open to men only. But in Greece there is a women’s monastery where they live according to strict Athonite rules and serve without electricity, by candlelight. This monastery, in the village of Souroti, was founded by Elder Paisios the Athonite, whose books have been so popular in the past few years in America and Russia. A correspondent of “Neskuchnii Sad” headed to Souroti to meet with people who remember Elder Paisios.*

[Photo: artoficons.com  ](https://preview.redd.it/2uir2msy2qyd1.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=1849ce0912453e475f7128678024b87e22c8d76e)

**The greatest miracle**

Near the elder’s grave, to the left of the altar of the Church of St. Arsenios the Cappadocian, there is always a crowd of people, especially on Sundays. The usual picture: Husband and wife, kneeling together, pray together for something in common. “Like John Chrysostom, being a monk, Elder Paisios knew about family life more than those married people who would come to him,” says Vasilios Sarris, a former teacher at the Athonite school for boys. The elder was illuminated by Divine love. Once I went to him to complain about my father-in-law, that he was holding up my wedding and it could have caused me to commit a sin of the flesh! The elder listened to my anger, but did not succumb to intimidation, but on the contrary, pitied my father-in-law, suggesting that he had financial difficulties! It turned out he was right. A little while later, when he had settled his debts, we had a wonderful wedding.”

“The greatest miracle that happened to me by the prayers of Elder Paisios was connected with my family,” says Nicholas Mentesidis. “For six months before his death, I lamented to the elder that I wanted more children, but my wife, who was forty years old, had a heart condition. The elder comforted and reassured me. Upon returning, I found out that my wife was pregnant, but the doctors said she couldn’t give birth: ‘Have an abortion, otherwise either she or the baby will die.’ I went to see the elder again and he said, ‘Let’s do this—you keep the child, and I will be praying. Your wife’s heart will be strong, and your child’s heart will be kind!’ That is how it happened. Three months after the elder died, we had a boy. We named him Paisios.”

https://preview.redd.it/a4mfcy413qyd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa3baddae8ceff6fa7314ab2b78f52de13a3e617

People continue to visit the elder even after his death. Some ask about something, and some thank him for intercession before God. Lyudmila and Judith came to Greece from Arizona on an iconography tour. They were both learning to paint icons, although Judith was a Buddhist, but she got interested in Orthodoxy after she read the book *Words* of Elder Paisios. “I loved him so much, that we strayed from the group now to come here,” Judith said, smiling widely. And Lyudmila commented, “She isn’t baptized yet, but she is looking for her faith now—I think she will come to God through the elder’s books and his prayers.”

There is a nun on duty all day at the elder’s grave. She cleans the cross, takes care of the candles, and gives pilgrims oil from the lampada and photos of the elder. In the evening, when the monastery closes, they cover the grave with a special tarpaulin tent, wrap the wooden cross, and carry the lampada and flowers that pilgrims bring to the elder to a shelter. “A priest from Cyprus came to see me two months ago,” says Fr. Gregory, a spiritual child of Elder Paisios and spiritual father of the women’s monastery of the Transfiguration. “He told about how his son was driving in a car really fast, when a truck came flying towards him with a driver who fell asleep from fatigue. A second before the collision, his son saw Elder Paisios in place of the truck driver. There was a terrible accident, but no one suffered at all. It turns out that before their son left, his matushka inconspicuously put a photo of the elder which she took from his grave in her son’s car with a prayer.”

**Obedience**

No obedience is stipulated for three-day pilgrims in the monastery—just pray to God, live, read, enjoy yourself. But the nuns themselves are engaged only with their ecclesial obediences. “The elder blessed us to pray more, and to work with iconography, pilgrims, books,” says one of the older nuns. “We have an olive orchard where we gather olives to make oil for food and lampadas. We don’t grow anything else—we have no cows, goats, or chickens. Nuns should pray—it’s our business.” The elder wrote, “Monks do not abandon the desert to go into the world to help some poor man there or to visit some sick man in the hospital and bring him oranges or some other consolation—that which the laity usually do—work which God looks for from them, but monks should pray for them.”

https://preview.redd.it/7nyj3gz33qyd1.png?width=500&format=png&auto=webp&s=0bfe8bce529de280c7485b2f5ac08ed013554144

Meanwhile, Christina, Barbara, and Evangelia begged for an obedience and happily went to wash dishes. “It’s boring having nothing to do! Last time we packaged candles and incense for the store,” they said, picking out the disposable cups after Sunday’s invasion of tourists. “And sometimes they let us vacuum the guest rooms and put out the loukoumi.” No one has counted how much loukoumi we go through in a day, but about a thousand people come on weekends, and each eats one or two pieces. Loukoumi is bought by the box in the monastery. The pilgrims bring coffee themselves, as a gift, but the sisters immediately make it to treat the visitors.

“The elder didn’t take anything from anyone, and if he did take something, it was only to immediately give it away,” says Nicholas Mentesidis. “When I wanted to bring something to the elder, I would call Souroti to find out what he needed and bring it as if it was from the monastery—otherwise he wouldn’t take it.”

**To be near a saint**

The jeweler Nicholas Mentesidis is making an image of Elder Paisios on silver plating in his studio—without a halo, as is right, but the elder’s holiness for him, as for everyone else, is obvious. “We leave the issue of his canonization to the Church,” the nuns say. “Probably some time should pass; maybe a few dozen years or a few generations.\[1\] Elder Paisios was a great ascetic, and the Lord will undoubtedly glorify him in His time. Although no one prevents us from praying to him privately already.”

“Once I asked the elder what we should ask God for,” says Athanasios Rakovalis. “He answered me: ‘Repentance; that we would see our damage and fight with all our might, because not all will be saved. We have entered this world not to live sweetly, but to pass an exam, at least with a C, because there will be no chance for a makeup test.’ Then I began to think about the sinful condition in which I find myself, and I was very sorrowful that I grieve the Lord, and that I do nothing good. I told the elder about it. The elder hugged and kissed me: ‘Christ came to earth to save sinners; the righteous have no need of it.’

Once I became very worried because there are so few Christians in the world, and among them so few commune, and even less than that number understand what Communion is. The elder said that people do not want to hear about Christ today, and turn away from Him. But soon there will be events which will change the situation, and people will want to learn about Christ more and more. Homes will be filled with icons, the streets with churches, and churches with believers. Everything that he said to me personally came to pass. For example, I was not yet married, and the elder told me how many children I would have. Therefore, I am 100% certain, and as for the rest of what he said—you’ll see—it will happen.

It is very good to be near a saint! The elder was so humble that we would forget who it was before us. He had so much love that everyone felt he was closer than their own father. He was a very lively and open person. He spoke to us as equals, and we freely spoke about everything. Sometimes I really reflect upon how wonderful he was, and then I feel reverence and fear. I always felt the presence of God near him. Once we rode on the train together for three days—what joy I had from the closeness of our interaction! The elder propelled us into Heaven. We were spiritually transfigured by the grace of God, just having him near. It’s like when you’re next to a fireplace—you feel the warmth, although nothing is happening on your end.”

**Elder Paisios**

Elder Paisios the Athonite, Arsenios Eznepidis in the world, was born in Pharasa, Cappadocia (Turkey) in 1924. There were ten other children in the family besides little Arsenios. Two weeks after Arsenios’ birth, the Pharasa Greeks fled Turkey for Greece. Before leaving, St. Arsenios the Cappadocian (1841-1924), then a village parish priest, baptized the boy and gave the child his own name, prophetically saying, “I want to leave a monk after me.”

Above all, young Arsenios so loved to read the lives of the saints, such that his older brother would even take the books and hide them from him. Arsenios’ youth passed in the city of Konitsa, where he studied in school and learned the carpentry trade. But with the beginning of the civil war in Greece (1944-1948), he was drafted into the army. Having served, Arsenios left for Mt. Athos, and in 1954 he became a riassaphore monk with the name Averky. Two years later he was tonsured to the small schema with the name Paisios. From 1958 to 1962, he lived in Stomio Monastery near the village of Konitsa, after which he went to Mt. Sinai. He spent two years in the Skete of the Holy Martyrs Galakteon and Epistimia on Mt. Sinai, where his cell is preserved today, but then he returned to Mt. Athos due to a lung disease and settled into Iveron Skete.

His sickness developed so strongly in 1966 that they removed a large piece of Fr. Paisios’ lungs. When the elder was lying in the hospital, he was approached by several women desiring the strict monastic life, with the request to help them found a monastery with an Athonite rule. The elder received the bishop’s blessing to open a women’s monastery, found a good place for building, and moved the first sisters into Souroti already in 1967. Fr. Paisios specially came from Mt. Athos and lived in the community for two months to help establish order in the monastery. “He delved into all aspects of life—beginning with the most simple, everyday things, up to the most serious and spiritual,” writes Abbess Philothea in one of the first books about the elder, published in Souroti. “He was only forty-three years old, but Fr. Paisios already then possessed the true wisdom of an elder. The elder helped us by his prayers and by his letters which he sent from Athos to various sisters personally or to all of us together.” Visiting “his sisters” twice a year, he took care of the monastery until his death on July 12, 1994. The elder died and was buried not on Mt. Athos, where he lived a large part of his life, but in the monastery he founded, in Souroti. “It was providential,” the nuns believe. “If the elder had been buried on Athos, women would not be able to come to him!”

Or at least something to stop the bugs?,"I’ve made a few mistakes in my life. Hell, maybe more than a few. Somewhere between a handful and a fuck-ton is probably a good estimation. I think the issue is I put my trust in the wrong places, but I’m just trying to navigate the world as best I can like everyone else. My sister always said I’m more gullible than I should be at my age - very suggestible is a nicer way to put it I think. My beliefs and convictions are like loose flower petals on a gusty day - they drift in whatever way the wind pushes them. One moment I’m floating east, the wind changes direction, and now I’m floating west. One day, I’ll believe in climate change, then I listen to a certain popular podcast, and now I think it’s a hoax. I know, it’s pathetic. I swear to God I’ll change if I can make it through this year, but I’ve exhausted my savings, and the pills are running out. I can hear them all skittering and slamming all around me, just out of sight, waiting for the effects of the medication to wear off.

It all started a few weeks ago. My life was unremarkable then, but at least it was normal. I had a cushy job at a local tech company, the same one I’ve had for the last five years. Reasonable hours, good benefits plan, 6 weeks of paid time off - I lived comfortably but noticeably alone. No wife, no girlfriend. I wasn’t born with a lot of charm. I was never very proficient at initiating pleasantries, and even if I did manage to start a conversation with a lady, I couldn’t find the words to maintain it. Of course, that would all be one thing if I was some hulking adonis, smooth and chiseled and all that - maybe then I could have compensated for my lack of a silver tongue. But I was never able to grow any muscle despite my efforts. I bought and tried a lot of different supplements that were supposed to help stimulate growth. Powders with names like “Muscle Matrix” and “Crazy Muscle”. They never did a damn thing, even put me in the hospital one time for kidney damage. Retrospectively, I should have also been working out while on those supplements. I wanted to wait until the supplements started having an effect before I began really working out.

Terrible cystic acne was the icing on top. Red, painful craters had littered my face since I turned 16. Tried everything for that too - bee venom, reiki, power juicing. Nothing I was recommended online seemed to have the desired effect. And it all gave me the impression that I was utterly unworthy in comparison to other guys my age. I could feel myself starting to give up on a life that was more fulfilling than the one I already had, and on companionship in general. Then, I saw the ad pop on my Facebook page. It promised to fix me, and I fell for it. Hook, line, and sinker. 

It read something like this:

*Do you have trouble attracting women? Unable to catch a vixen’s eye from all the way at the other end of the bar? Does your mere presence in a room inspire overwhelming, knee-buckling repulsion from any potential mates? Before the modern age, there were no solutions. Lonely devils would go to their doctors, looking for salvation, only instead to be told there was nothing else to be done - Western Medicine cursing them to die alone. But we don’t live in the past, do we, dear friends? With major advancements in natural attraction technology, Lucius Bartleby, Ph.D., is proud to announce: Zygentra Ultimate, the miracle medication for the misbegotten common man. With Zygentra Ultimate, even the lowliest bachelor has hope for a happy ending. One pill is all it takes to change everything about you.* 

In big, confident words, the bottom said:

*One payment, one pill - one solution to the problem of you. Email* [zygentraNOW@gmail.com](mailto:zygentraNOW@gmail.com) *for details.*

Even though the advertisement didn’t even mention what it would fix about me, I was intrigued. The ad had all the buzz words - “miracle”, “technology”, “happy ending”. Their distrust of Western Medicine hit close to home, too. As far as I was concerned, doctors were pill pushers controlled by pharmaceutical companies that pulled their marionette strings from the shadows. I mean, what was in the pills they recommended anyway? And for that matter, why can’t I pronounce half the compounds that make up vaccines? Thiomersal, Polysorbate 80 - I mean formaldehyde, for Christ’s sake. It all felt so artificial and unsafe. But this advertisement seemed to promote something more “of the earth” and ""organic"", the so-called “natural attraction technology”. Tired of being lonely and unworthy, I emailed the company. 

Like I said, hook, line, and sinker. Biggest mistake of my life.

In my message to the company, I tried to perform my due diligence in vetting the supplement. What was in it? How much was the supplement? Would it interact with the Chinese muscle-enhancing herbs I ordered the week before? 

This was their response, copy-pasted from my Gmail:

*Greetings Zach,*

*Thank you for your interest in Zygentra Ultimate. One pill, one payment, one solution to the problem of you.* 

*To clarify, Zygentra is a medication, not a supplement - though no matter what you call it, it is a miracle. Through a proprietary mechanism of action that utilizes the wonders of CRISPR technology, Zygentra enables the human body to naturally self-regulate the hormonal disequilibriums that are to blame for a variety of male inequities: it can resolve poor muscle growth, weak libidos, erectile dysfunction, and a bevy of disfiguring skin conditions including but not limited to: seborrheic dermatitis, psoriasis, lichen planus simplex, and cystic acne.* 

*Unfortunately, the future is not always affordable, and it is rarely covered by insurance. Thankfully, this one-time cost can last upwards of a year, if not much longer. Zygentra essentially teaches your body to produce life-changing pheromones that are genetically transplanted from the naturally occurring Lepisma saccharium species. In short - one pill is all you need.* 

*Zygentra Ultimate can solve the problem of you with a one-time payment of 30,000 US dollars. We do not accept payment plans. Also, for obvious reasons, we recommend all of our clients relocate prior to taking their dose; Antarctica is preferable, but Northern Canada is a reasonable alternative.* 

*Please let us know if you are planning to pursue a happy ending. If so, we can help set up a wire transfer.* 

*Amy,*

*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* 

I had to pick my jaw off the floor after I finished quickly scanning the email, skipping over the scientific mumbo-jumbo to find the price point. They seriously wanted me to pay 30,000 dollars, one lump sum, for this supplement. It wasn’t that I couldn’t afford the payment - I could, but barely, utilizing a nest egg my mom left for me after she passed. It was just an obscene amount of money. But it certainly was alluring - one pill that would fix my body, or I guess teach it to fix itself, naturally? Was that even possible? When I thought about it more, the exorbitant fee made it feel more legitimate, like I was paying for cutting-edge technology that actually could work. Wouldn’t the Better Business Bureau prevent a company from selling a product for much more than it was worth? Wasn’t that illegal? 

To speed things up, I’ll skip the part where I contemplated my options, did a lot of online research, and signed a waiver that Amy mailed to me. Two weeks later, the singular pill arrived in an icebox as an overnight shipment from the Delfoy Pharmaceuticals headquarters. Amy told me they needed to keep it cold. 

It wasn’t like any pill I had taken before. The supplement more resembled an extra-large piece of caviar - gelatinous and orb-shaped. The box had no instructions, so I shrugged my shoulders and ingested it, using a swig of the nearest open Mountain Dew to wash it down. Initially, I had some regrets about the purchase. But with it now in my system, that regret morphed into excitement.

I was ready not to be alone anymore. 

No big change the first few days. Maybe I really was a sap, I thought. But one morning, while looking in the mirror, I noticed it - my skin was clearing up like it never had before. More than that, I felt virile and confident, seemingly out of the blue. My muscles even began to look more toned. It was a state of being entirely new to me, and at first, it was incredible. I finally felt confident and like I was worthy of affection. Riding that sensation for all it was worth, I asked Stacy, an attractive coworker, on a dinner date. I had fantasized about asking her out for what seemed like my entire life. She said yes. The ecstasy I experienced after that moment was unparalleled. It was like some heavy, invisible weights had been taken off my shoulders. We planned a dinner date at a local Italian place later that week. With the supplement coursing through my veins, I felt unstoppable and was pleasantly surprised about the lack of side effects. I had experienced some new floaters in my peripheral vision and mild armpit pain, but that was it.

At first, the date was everything I could have hoped for. Stacy always had an aura of kindness about her - she was angelic, honestly. It’s what drew me towards her in the first place. Even though I secured the date, I was still nervous about my ability to keep up a conversation through the meal. To my surprise, it wasn’t difficult. Because I was different, improved by the supplement, I guess I just wasn’t as fearful of rejection anymore. As the date progressed, I was shocked to find out that Stacy had also been stockpiling the courage to ask me on a date:

*“Over the last week? Since I started my new skin regimen, I mean.”* I said, choking on the last few words because I was never very good at lying. I didn’t want to scare Stacy off by volunteering the information that I had recently purged my bank accounts to pay for Zygentra. 

She giggled, a cute and tiny laugh that made my heart swell with affection. I think she was under the impression that the part about the skin regimen was a playful joke. Then she said something that made my head spin:

*“No, nothing to do with whatever new moisturizer you invested in. And a lot longer than just this week. For at least a year, I think. I always found you handsome, and you were always respectful and polite to me and everyone else in the office - a good sign of character. You were just quiet and reserved. I couldn’t tell if you’d say yes if I asked, so I never did. A bit childish and cowardly, I know, but sometimes I just feel small and out of place in the world, if that makes any sense.”* remarked Stacy, eyes diverting from mine while she made this confession.  

Her words felt familiar - or maybe not her words; it was the way she put the words together. The underlying self-deprecation, I mean. She had some venomous monologue playing on loop in her head, just like I did. Broke my heart at first, and I wasn’t sure how to respond. But I noticed at that moment that I felt a little less lonely for the first time in my adult life. I smiled, met her eyes, and came up with the most ornate, reverent statement I could to comfort her and let her know I understood:

*“You’re an absolute vision, Stacy. Like, you’re radiant. I’m sorry it’s hard for you to see it sometimes, but I really get that pain.”*

The expression on her face changed, now warm and relaxed, and I could tell I actually did manage to console her. I got lost in that moment then, in the beautiful comfort of it. Even as I type it up, I find myself getting lost in the memory of it. But something abruptly pulled me out of the moment then, and it’s the same thing that’s pulling me out of its memory now: terrible, skittering things on the outskirts of my vision. 

In the restaurant, I was experiencing worsening floaters in my periphery, but I was too transfixed on Stacy to notice something was off - that maybe they weren’t just floaters. As our dessert arrived, I felt something vibrating in the sole of my dress shoe. It really gave me a start, and I reflexively stomped my right foot into the floor, surprising Stacy in turn. I took off my shoe to examine its contents, only to find the crushed body of a silverfish. Its greyish carapace was split into three asymmetric pieces from the force of my stomp. Each piece was still wriggling a little bit, and I felt nausea rise in my stomach. 

It was bigger than any silverfish I’d ever seen before, too. In my experience, they never grew larger than an inch. This silverfish was easily 5 inches long, if not more. I could count at least 20 other, equally large silverfish crawling around in a wobbly circle, with me as the center. Before I killed the insect in my shoe, the other dinnergoers had noticed the bugs and were flagging down restaurant staff to complain. At first, I was with them - what kind of restaurant serves food with this type of infestation? It took the tickling, wriggling feeling of something crawling up my left pant leg to cause me to re-evaluate the situation. 

Wildly, I made a circle with my thumb and index finger and tightened it around my knee, pushing down the length of my calf in an attempt to expel what I knew were more silverfish before they found their way higher up into my pants. When my palm first connected with my knee, I felt a sickening crunch under the tip of my index finger. The maneuver pushed out three silverfish in total, one headless from being caught in the crossfire of my hand meeting my knee. When I looked up, the restaurant was in a state of pandemonium. At that point, there were definitely more than 20, maybe 100 or 200, silverfish radiating in a circle around me. It finally registered - whatever was happening, I was the cause, and I hadn’t been experiencing floaters before - I was seeing silverfish skittering quickly around in my peripheral vision. 

I shot up from my chair, frightening Stacy again, accompanied by the sensation of another crunch in the shoe I hadn’t yet taken off. I said something to my date, couldn’t tell you what, and I excused myself from the table while moving towards the door. Outside in the parking lot, I began sprinting to my car with only one shoe on; but then I remembered that I had driven Stacy here. I briefly turned around to get her, but I could see gleaming silver little bullets racing to catch up to me on the asphalt, lit up by the sparkle of parking lot lights. I U-turned and sprinted even faster to my car, got in, and just started driving. After 15 minutes, I pulled over and urgently emailed Delfoy Pharmaceuticals from my phone. I wanted to know how to reverse the effects of Zygentra Ultimate.

Not long after I parked, I began to see silverfish on the front windshield, leaking into the car through whatever cracks they could find. I floored it, but it was in a park, so I went nowhere. For the third time that night, I again felt the snap of their brittle bodies against my foot, having just crushed another two silverfish. A moment later, I felt one making its way up my left earlobe. I whipped my head to the right so hard that my neck would later be painfully sore, but the force managed to launch a silverfish off my ear to somewhere in the back of my Sudan. Putting the car in drive, I exploded down the country road I had parked on. I kept driving, killing silverfish as I went, till I heard the sound of an inbox notification come from my iphone, which was about two hours after I had sent the email:

*Hello Zach,*

*I am sorry to hear you are disappointed with our product. Unfortunately, there is no reversal agent for Zygentra Ultimate. I thought I made this very clear in our introductory email, and you did sign a release saying you understood the risk-benefit profile of the medication.* 

*To re-explain, Zygentra Ultimate utilizes CRISPR technology to give the human body the ability to produce pheromones from Lepisma saccharium, the most common species of silverfish in America. Laboratory studies have shown that these pheromones can help with male sexual dysfunction and certain skin conditions due to an anti-inflammatory effect. As you must know, pheromones are designed to attract members of the opposite sex of the species producing them. It is basically a big sign around an animal’s neck saying: “I am ready to mate”. This is why we recommend relocation to Northern Canada or Antarctica in conjunction with Zygentra Ultimate - these are some of the few areas in the world that Lepisma saccharium do not naturally inhabit.* 

*The medication is not reversible, however, because CRISPR is gene-editing technology - the reason your body “learns” to create the foreign hormones is because Zygentra Ultimate inserts the pheromone-producing silverfish DNA into your genetic code. How else would one pill cause an effect lasting a year or more? Additionally, the armpit pain you are experiencing is most likely the rapid growth of modified glandular tissue responsible for producing the silverfish pheromones.* 

*I still recommend considering physical relocation, I hear the Yukon is wonderful this time of year! The alternate solution would be to invest in Zygentra Plus, which can help mitigate some of the silverfish-attracting side effects of Zygentra Ultimate. We recognize that this is an emergency situation, and Defloy Pharmaceuticals is always willing to help where we can! We have urgently shipped a 48-hour trial supply of Zygentra Plus to your home, for free.* 

*Please consider your options and get back to us. If you would like to purchase additional Zygentra Plus, a week’s supply costs $750, with a 5 percent discount if you purchase the medication in bulk.*

*Amy,*

*Senior Sales Associate and Miracleworker at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals* 

When I received this email, I had a grand total of 3,500 dollars to my name. Desperation hit me like an avalanche, I felt like I was buried in an instant. A little under 4 grand was nowhere near the funds I would need to move from Miami to Northern Canada. Relocating would also force me to quit my job, and I didn’t want to leave Stacy behind. Retrospectively, I should have just used that money to move myself and my shitty car as far north as it would take me. 

When Zygentra Plus finally arrived five days later, I was beyond sleep-deprived. I had called out of work that week, as I certainly couldn’t come in and work on code as the fucking pied piper of silverfish. I spent that time driving around, stopping only when I felt myself drifting into sleep at the wheel. I would pull over to wherever I could and close my eyes, but before long, the sensation of silverfish crawling into my mouth or between my armpits would wake me up with a start, like I had jabbed myself with an adrenaline shot - at which point I would resume driving. No amount of insect repellant spray or mouse traps seemed to prevent the legion from getting to me. 

I hastily unpackaged the box containing the pro bono Zygentra Plus. The instructions on the supplement were: *take four pills by mouth every two hours*. Every two fucking hours. It did work at keeping the bugs away, but only if I religiously took the medication as instructed, which only served to minimally improve my sleep deprivation. I needed to return to work, but that ended up being a mistake, too. I had ditched Stacy on our first date without explanation and then proceeded not to talk to her for a week while I was driving around in circles, waiting for the Zygentra Plus to arrive. When she saw me again at work, I had dark circles around my bloodshot eyes the size of trash bags, and I nervously scanned my surroundings for silverfish. She said hello to me, and I don’t think I said hello back. Instead, I opted to launch into a minute-by-minute retelling of my last week. What I told her was an incoherent mess. Stacy nodded along politely to my tale, but I could see fear and concern rising in her eyes. Eventually, I gave her mercy, excused myself in the middle of a sentence, and pitifully returned to my desk. I dragged my body through about half of a workday before the side effects of Zygentra Plus started.

Out of nowhere, I felt my mouth fill uncomfortably with saliva. When I tried to sip my morning coffee, dribble would involuntarily spill out of my mouth, down my chin and onto my shirt collar. Before long, I had a half-crescent of soaked fabric around my neck despite my efforts to keep my mouth closed at all times. Next, my eyes began watering uncontrollably, making it look like I was quietly sobbing all through the morning. The final straw was when I took my hand off my coffee cup, only to have a thin layer of palm skin remain stuck to the grip, peeling from my hand and causing immense and immediate pain. I screamed. And then, of course, there was a lot of bleeding. In a panic, I hastily left my desk without saying a word, no doubt leaving behind plenty of tears, saliva, skin and blood. My boss caught up and confronted me about my behavior before I could leave the building. I tried to say something, but saliva just erupted from my mouth instead. I probably looked rabid.

I didn't come back to work the next day, or the following day. A few days after that, a message on my cellphone answering machine told me I was fired.

Amy, resident miracle worker at Defloy Pharmaceuticals, wasn’t much help with the situation. I let her know that, although Zygentra Plus was helping keep the insects away, the side effects from it weren’t much more bearable. The excess saliva and tears were one thing, but pieces of my skin were sloughing off with the slightest manipulation like I was some human danish. And I still wasn’t sleeping - I needed to set multiple alarms to get myself up every two hours to take the new medication; otherwise, the silverfish would be back. She explained to me that this was expected, as Zygentra Plus acted as a low-dose insecticide that I was digesting and releasing into the air around me from my pores or what was left of them. At the brink of insanity, I demanded to speak with “Lucius Bartleby”, the supposed genius creator and mind behind the Zygentra line of products mentioned in the original advertisement. I thought maybe he would have an elegant solution to all of this. In response, Amy said, and I quote:

*“Well, that will be impossible. Lucius Bartleby is more of an idea than a person. Here at Delfoy Pharmaceuticals, we all aspire to achieve the goals that Dr. Bartleby represents. Also, it seems to help with sales.”*

But don’t worry, she said, there was still something to be done - Amy theorized that drastically increasing my zinc levels might mitigate some of the symptoms from Zygentra Plus. I spent my last 500 dollars on that supplement, unsure of what I would do next, even if it did help. But I needed relief. Moreover, I needed to keep taking the pills because I was terrified of what would happen to me when I ran out, and the silverfish came back. My car was out of gas, my skin was breaking down, I was jobless and nearly out of money. If they returned, I would have limited defenses and nowhere to hide. I'm not particularly eager to think about what would happen to me.

The zinc supplement was a purple-reddish liquid that I was instructed to drink once a day. I voraciously gulped it down, immediately experiencing excruciating pain from my lips to deep in my chest. I would come to learn that the compound I drank, Zinc Hydrosulfide, is a very strong acid. I stared at the words “strong acid” in the email, dumbfounded, with blood and saliva dripping from my scalded mouth onto the screen. Amy then offered a subdermal injection to help me tolerate the Zinc Hydrosulfide, and I just started laughing. Must have been laughing for a while, because when my laughing slowed down I started to see silver floaters in my periphery again, meaning I was due for my next dose of Zygentra Plus.

I could barely swallow the pills after what the liquid had done to my mouth and esophagus, almost passing out from the pain. Even if I had the money to pay for the 2,000-dollar subdermal injection, which I do not, I have no idea where I would even inject it into. Didn’t have much of a “dermis” left after the effects of Zygentra Plus, which had liberated me from a good portion of my skin.

Effectively, I am now stuck. The acidic liquid that was supposed to help with the side effects from the pills has now prevented me from taking *any* pills, or at least has made it a great deal harder and more painful. The medication that would help me to tolerate the acidic liquid was no good either - the pills had dissolved the skin that it was supposed to be injected under. Perhaps most critically of all, I am now broke.

Thought about going to the hospital - some combination of fear and shame prevented me from doing that. Calling an ambulance may be my next move, but I’m not sure they can do anything for me now. The silverfish will find me no matter where I am, I’m sure there are plenty lurking unseen in the cracks and crevices of the hospital. Plus, who knows if the medications they'd give me would interact with the supplements.

So, with about 12 hours of my oral insecticide left, I have decided to throw a bit of a Hail Mary. Has anyone else taken Zygentra Ultimate before and knows how to reverse it? Or at least have a homeopathic remedy to help stop the bugs?

Begins with a mellow theme in E flat major. Instead of being in sonata form, this movement is actually in rondo form, which is new for Beethoven to do in the first movement. One of the episodes abruptly turns fast, and modulates into C major. Overall, this movement feels like peace. It’s hard to describe as there is typically more struggle in his music

The second movement sounds like telling a scary story while camping, with its chromatic chord progression. It’s dark and brooding but it’s still a scherzo with a little bit of playfulness. This movement is in scherzo-trio form.

The third movement is unique in where it ends in a different key than it begins. This movement sounds like the wisdom of an elderly person. Their aged voice is comforting to listen to, until they eventually drift back to sleep, leading to the cadenza that leads straight into…

The energetic finale, which holds the most amount of weight in this piece. This movement is everywhere. This movement is that one kid in the class that is super outgoing, but maybe a little bit crazy; the kid that is already drinking coffee at 10 years old. This movement is in sonata rondo form, with the coda bringing back thematic material from the third movement. Maybe it’s the grandparents waiving their fingers and telling that kid to sit down. 

This sonata continues Beethoven’s innovative streak, with him developing the hallmark traits of his music. His sonata no. 13 feels just a little bit more refined than his last sonata, with the movements really starting to feel like they belong together as one sonata.",0,1730654964.0,classicalmusic,0,0.5,False

My goal is to make a punk cyberpunk story,"The silence of suburbia was maddening. Matthew’s stomach churned at the static trees and loneliness of the roads. Each house mirrored the last, going on an endless sprawl of dull massive houses with mute-colored roofs and neatly cut lawns. The streetlight assaulted his eyes as he trudged down the pale sidewalk. Occasionally his fingers attempted to adjust a headset that wasn’t there. 

“Twenty-seven, twenty-nine, thirty-one..” He counted the house numbers. He paused at thirty-three. He stared down the red door in front of him. Swallowing the anxiety crawling in his throat, he forced his legs up the steps. *Causing a security breach at T.D.C was less nerve wracking than this.* His fist hovered over the door.

“You got this, Matt. Quick and easy. Remember ,” he closed his eyes and sighed. “He deserves this.” 

The door shook with each knock. Matthew noticed an unfamiliar glowing red eye looking through the peephole. It vanished from his sight. One by one a fury of clicks and twist sounds followed. Once the concert of locks ended the doorknob spun. The door pulled and slid across the carpeted floor. Towering over Matthew was his older brother, David. His head was fully bald while his beard was clean shaven.. Matthew cringed seeing his brother’s face. *Just because you CAN do something, doesn’t mean you should.* 

He struggled to focus on one set of two eyes. A horde of red eyes were bolted onto David’s face. The eyes moved independently of each other, blinking out of sync. Back in Ponds city, it was a rarity to be in a room with a person without cyber parts. But this... 



“Like them?” He beamed. “Had to fly to Korea to get them installed. TDC official. My vision is beyond twenty-twenty. The shit I can see,  it’s crazy man.” His mass of eyes focused on Matthew. “Seriously? A basic chip implant in your palm and one enhanced contact? Bro what the hell have you been doing?”



David’s question echoed in Matthew’s mind. He remembered the terminal. Standing in an endless black void smashed  together with other cyber criminals. The chaos of voices in the air, the different designs of avatars, and the kaleidoscope of colors that floated around them. Each carrying a “quest.” 



“I just needed a break from the city, is all.”



“You?” 

Matthew walked past his brother feeling all of his eyes scanning his steps. 

“Few months ago you got kicked out and cheered because you can live in the city. And now-.”

“I struggled, Dave.” Matthew snapped. “Shit was harder than I thought, ok?” 

The door closed. The living room had been identical to the day he had left. A massive screen planted on the wall overshadowed the u shaped couch that sat in front of it. Between them was a coffee table. Littered with fancy trinkets his mother obsessed over. The walls were still painted lime green and the gray curtain shielded the bay windows. At the end of the room rested an empty fireplace wide enough for Santa to walk through. Matthew's eyes drifted towards one of the family photos lined up against the wall.  A blue background with he, his brother, and mother. A facade of smiles puppetry by a man wearing an elegant $1500 suit with his fingers littered with gold rings. With heavy hands grasped on the younger Matthew and David. The bags under his mother’s eyes were carefully hidden and the outrageously neat haircut his father had forced on them were perfect. Matthew ran his fingers through his dark hair.  His mother had her brown hair neatly put together in a thick braid.

“I’m surprised you kept this as a picture,” Matthew touched the photo anticipating a reaction.

“Yeah well we’re not too obsessed to change everything.” 

Matthew raised an eyebrow at David, focusing his attention on his eyes.

“This,” David pointed towards his collection of eyes. “Is different. Security reasons and a money maker. “He walked from the door and sat on the couch. “The amount of views I get online by just showing off what these can do is in the millions. Like-.”

“Wait. What do you mean by security?” 

“Dad’s been busy. Heard he got a promotion,” David shifted his weight on the couch. “Offered me an incentive and I took it.”

“You disfigured your face because of him?”

“What? No.I upgraded myself because of him. Anywhere I go,” the sound of his fingers against his eyes echoed in the room. “I got all eyes on me.” 



“Well isn’t that great,” Matthew’s body dropped into the couch. His muscles melted from the comfort.

“It’s good to see you, Matt.” “Yeah?”

“Yeah. Too bad dad's gonna lose his shit once he sees you.” Matthew rolled his head back. 

“Just need two days here. I can hide out in the treehouse. Not like he goes into the backyard anyway. “ “It’s already too late, bro. Remember what I said? Security.” Matthew turned towards his brother. The red lights replaced his reflection.",1,1730654875.0,Cyberpunk,1,1.0,False

I want to write her a letter, is it a good idea?","We are having troubles in our relationship with my girlfriend. In fact we broke up a few days ago, but I see that she has feelings for me. I always knew, that I love her more than she loves me, but I'm fine with it, as long as she has feelings for me. Between 2 people there is always one whose love is stronger. It is the 3rd time we have such a problem in a year. The last 2 times we didn't break up, I managed to work it out and made things right. She really needs to see a psychaitrist (most of us do), she had her share of trauma in the past and It doesn't bother me, I'm ready to help her in any way. Yesterday she came to my home to bring me my stuff and to take hers. She started crying in a few minutes after she entered the house. I almost cried as well. We spent an hour packing her things, talking, even laughing. This was the first time she REALLY talked about her feelings without crying and being all defensive. Before it was almost always my monologue about how we need to talk about our problems and feelings, she was listening (but probably not hearing) what I was saying. I took her stuff and helped her to carry it to the bus stop. I told her that my offer still stands (I offered her to take a break for some time and to work with a psychiatrist, separetely or together - doesn't matter). She didn't say no to that. Before I met her it was my 4th year living in a dorm (I was and currently Am a student), I've never had a job, except for some one-time offers (thanks to my parents for giving me money). I was scared of talking to people, meeting new people. I met like 2 guys that were not just ""people I know"", I could call them friends (2 guys in 4 years of living in this country). I rarely went out (3-4 times a year), I spent all my time sitting in my dorm room, playing games or watching something (doing homework as well). To put it mildly, I was extremely introverted. But after we met (through the dating app) everything changed, not right away but changed. 3 months into our relationship I moved in with my friend (we had separate rooms and it was our flat, not a dorm). Shortly after that I got my first job (video editing for a company). It was not that bad in terms of money, but there were some problems with the organization itself. And the thing is - I WANTED to work. I wanted to earn money, so I wouldn't have to take money from my parents to buy my girlfriend flowers or some clothes. Her being in my life completely changed me. I am a really stubborn person, but when it comes to her... She could get away with anything, literally. The slightest routine problems could start a huge conflict when it was between me and my roommate or brother. But not when it comes to her. You accidentaly broke the cup and spilled coffee all over my bathroom? Not a problem. You put a stain on my favourite shirt? Turns out it's not that big of a deal after all. You want me to get something to eat when i clearly don't want to go - whatever you say, baby. I think there are plenty of people that will understand what I mean. In the year we know each other, I never raised my voice to her, not even once. Whatever she did, couldn't get angry with her. She told me, her friends told her, my mum tells me that i'm too emotionally healthy, whatever they mean by that. But even though I'm very calm all the time, emotionally i'm very vulnurable, I just don't show it on my face. I was thinking this could be one of the reasons of our problems. I don't scream, im dont wave my arms around trying to tell something. I just calmly tell her what I think and ask her opinion. I have a feeling that it makes her doubt my feelings and intentions towards her. So I decided to write my thoughts here. Maybe someone will say something that will help me. Maybe I will show her this post. Or i will write a separate letter, idk.

Sorry for a long text :)

1gis4hh,https://www.reddit.com/r/learnmachinelearning/comments/1gis4hh/image_grouping_in_structured_sets/,Image Grouping In Structured Sets?,"Hello, I am a somewhat seasoned developer, but I have never touched on machine learning. I'm asking this question to see if someone can point me in the right direction or provide resource links.

I want to make something that groups similar images based on color, style, theme, or functionality. Specifically, I'd like it to be able to ""match"" items that could go together in a cohesive way within a well-defined set. For example, if I had a list of images of clothing items like a shirt, jacket, pants, shoes, and hat, I’d like the program to suggest combinations that create a complete outfit, pairing items that match in style or color.

Alternatively, if I were working with images of items like a sofa, coffee table, rug, and lamp, I’d want it to suggest pieces that fit together to create a coordinated room setup. The point is that within this defined set, certain items “fill slots” to complete a cohesive grouping based on style or theme.

I’m looking to understand if there’s a framework or library suited for matching items in this way, as well as any key machine-learning concepts that would help me get started.",1,1730654767.0,learnmachinelearning,0,1.0,False
1gis3zg,https://www.reddit.com/r/venting/comments/1gis3zg/life_is_hard/,Life is hard,"

For some reason life doesn’t get better. I have had depression since I was diagnosed at the age 14 and since then it’s been awful. Im lost, I don’t know what to do. My patience is running thin I don’t have that much energy anymore and my discipline is about to be gone. Im seventeen and I know people have it worse and that Im still a child but why is it so hard to live without feeling sad every moment. Sure I laugh I smile and I have fun sometimes but it always returns to sadness and loneliness. I have about 3-4 friends that I can truly trust, but still it’s so hard to open up. I can’t tell them that I feel lonely and alone and suicidal everyday. So I came here to vent because I just can’t do this anymore. I don’t want to live anymore. My family is trying their best to help me but I can’t even accept help. I’m helpless I don’t know how long I can keep doing this. I had about 2 attempts in the past 3 years and none were successful. I have been in a few mental hospitals for my health but they didn’t seem to fix it, it might have made everything worse than it was. After my last attempt I think the person I was before actually died. I have a past with drugs I was an addict for a year and then my parents figured it out and I went to NA meetings for a couple of months. I thought it would help but I started using again and my friends started too. I just wish that it wasn’t my influence that made them use. I don’t want them to end up as me. They both have addictive personalities and tendencies and I think I’m loosing one of my friends to ketamine I don’t know what to do because her family has a lot of troubles and there is just no way that I’d tell her parents about this it won’t help because she mentioned about her suicidal tendencies so I don’t think I want something else to happen to her. Now onto me again. I’m tired Im so fucking tired of living this stupid life. Money is tight right now, my grades are slipping, I’m not trusting my parents as I used to. Everything is crumbling to pieces and I know I’m the one that can stop it but because of depression I have no energy all the time. I try to drink coffee but my mom doesn’t allow it because I drink too much in her opinion even though I need it to not fall asleep throughout the day. I’m thinking about ending things. I don’t want any more help because I just keep fucking everything up. I just want to die in some way that it isn’t suicide so my parents don’t blame themselves. I wish I could hire a hitman on myself but I have no money saved up and they cost a bunch. I want it to be an accident but fast because I’m losing hope and I might end up doing it myself. For now thank you for reading this fully English isn’t my first language so I’m sorry if I made any mistakes. And thanks!",1,1730654731.0,venting,1,1.0,False

I get along with all my coworkers, but my store manager has been bullying me in front of everyone since I started. 
It got to the point where I cried on the floor in front of everyone because I keep getting told I’m not in the correct position or I’m not good enough to be put where I am on the mic so everyone can hear. She’s on the mic all day talking badly about everyone and everything. I remember when I first started she called one of my coworkers mentally retarded cause they weren’t picking things up fast enough.
It’s been very confusing for me because I don’t move from my position that the shift lead gives me so when she tells me I’m in the wrong spot I tell her that’s where I was told to go. She then tells me I need to stop “talking back”, when I’m genuinely confused on what her expectations are from me. No matter where I am she blames me for any delays in peak times even when it is not my station where delays are happening. My shift leaders keep telling me they are impressed by how much better my times have gotten yet my manager just rolls her eyes at me. 
I love the work itself because I enjoy making drinks and connecting with customers but I feel as if I have no choice but to look for a new job because the mental strain this has taken on me is making my depression and suicidal thoughts worse. Today I was told by a shift lead that he is sorry for how the store manager treats me, and that the SM told all the shifts at a meeting that she doesn’t like me and he suspects it’s cause I’m not “from here”.

Attached pictures are from last 2 years, not recent. I'm 30yo female, finished Accutane 2,5 months ago and I see my acne is coming back in the same place I had it most before taking the pills. I never had acne as a teenager, then I got acne at 19yo and it was treated with success. I got acne back at 28yo (after a very long & traumatic event so I think it was stress related), and was treating it with 2 different doctors, nothing was working and they did not treat me seriously since I didn't have a very bad acne according to them. In the end I got Accutane for 18 weeks, 40mg.
Now I see my acne is coming back in the left corner of my mouth and onto the left cheek. During the two years I had acne (before Accutane) I had some pimples here and there but it was always the worst in the left corner of my mouth/cheek. Does anyone have any idea why it's just there and what to try? I tried different ointments and skincare that were recommended to me, excluded dairy, coffee, gluten, took different supplements.. You name it. Nothing was working. I don't want to go back to Accutane and I have no idea what to do now that I see it is forming again. I also think I'm paranoid 😅",1,1730654089.0,SkincareAddiction,5,1.0,False
1giruw5,https://www.reddit.com/r/Marriage/comments/1giruw5/husband_almost_cheated_on_me/,Husband almost cheated on me,"My husband (26) and I (26) have been together for six years and married for four. Recently, I’ve been dealing with severe stomach and dysautonomia issues, two months not more, leaving me unable to sleep and struggling with tachycardia and balance problems. I decided to go to Ukraine to stay with my parents, who are doctors, for proper treatment only for 12 days. When I returned, I found my husband in a state of massive anxiety and tears—something I had never seen before. He expressed that he felt abandoned during my illness, which made me feel terrible, but I had to focus on my health.

The next morning, I discovered all my belongings—my personal items and toiletries—were missing. Immediately, I sensed something was off. I confronted him and learned that while I was away for these 12 days, he had started talking to a 23-year-old girl from his gym, inviting her for coffee and chatting extensively. So one evening he decided to invite her over but hide my things to not make her feel bad. The only thing that stopped him was the Ukrainian flag in my scarf, which made him realize how wrong he was. He then told her it’s getting too far and stopped talking to her. That’s his story. He then said she reminded him of me when I was younger and more happier. The sad thing is that I tried to talk to him and spend time but he openly got annoyed with me being sick.

He insists he wants to be with me and only loves me, but I’m at a loss. Our relationship was perfect; we were best friends and supported each other unconditionally. This betrayal is incredibly painful, I don’t know how to cope with it…when I was lying there sick and afraid of bombing he was the only one I called to to feel safe. And in that time he was talking to her and sending goodnight messages.

Shannon and I are very close and my husband Mark, daughter Savannah (18F) and Dayna (16F) like her too, so we've never had any problems. Ted texted me on Saturday, the day before she arrived, if it was okay if he bought Bitagram, his friend of South Korean heritage over (this is relevant in my argument) and I said yes and the girls always bring their friends over and me and Mark like to be welcoming to anyone who comes, so it wasn't a problem. Today Shannon came over, and we had a little cake with candles, which she was happy with, and Bitagram seemed lovely and he was very respectful and kind, and Shannon liked him too. However, we were all drinking coffee in the living room and unwinding after the cake, and the topic of children arose. Shannon is infertile and 45F, recently she's been thinking about children, and she told us she would possibly adopt. We were all supportive, but Bitagram looked shocked. He asked if Shannon would adopt a family member, and she explained she would adopt a child but her own, from a children's home allowed to be adopted. Bitagram said that was 'disgusting' and he compared her to a recently arrested child kidnapper, taking children who weren't her own. Shannon burst into tears and hid in the bathroom for a bit, and I was so angry, as Shannon had been polite and kind to Bitagram so I didn't know why he said that and I think he overstepped the mark and I asked him to leave immediately. Bitagram looked taken aback, and Ted tried to persuade me but I told him I would not allow Bitagram here, and Mark agreed. Bitagram left, as well as Shannon a while after. Ted has told me South Korea does not approve of adoption and it is unheard of in their country. I told Ted Bitagram did something out of order and though he disapproved of adoption, in the UK it is accepted and not seen as disgusting. Ted called me 'racist' and 'intolerant of others beliefs' and cut the visit short. Savannah, who adores her older brother, was distraught, but Dayna was angry with them for ruining the gathering.

The next day they invited him and his family to my house. Now, by this time i had just seen only one picture of his and hadn’t spoken to him at all. 
When they came to our house, as usual, being a girl i was taken to meet the parents and everyone sitting in our drawing room after about an hour. 
Then after some very very loud silences since no one was speaking anything soon as i entered, the guy and me were sent to a room to discuss things.
Now the first impression i had was the guy is smart but i wasnt attracted to him. But i had this thing that i did not want to judge him too quickly.

Then, we got to talking a bit and he brought up this girl who he met via this AM setup and met for coffee later when she told him she wishes to pursue her masters of 2 years. Then he said that he couldn’t wait that long so things ended. Now before he told me this i had asked him to meet me outside so that we can discuss about things in detail to which he started this story. Then he proceeded on to say that we can only meet outside if its a confirmed yes from me. Then i said that how can i decide anything rn when we have literally not talked about anything of value. Then his reactions and posture kinda changed saying yea maybe we can. Idk things seemed off.

Then 2 minutes later i asked him how often does he come home since hes a doctor with the indian army posted not too far. To which he replied forthrightly but he can come weekly. Then i said okay then that means we can meet. He said but his parents cant wait that long. Im like oh, i did not know you want to marry that soon(by december). He did not have any answer to this, said i think our parents must be waiting, got up and just left.

Now im just baffled, what exactly happened? Are people too conservative? Was my ask of having a meeting just the two of us outside when our parents have already met too much? I don’t understand. ",7,1730653531.0,Arrangedmarriage,6,1.0,False
1girn5n,https://www.reddit.com/r/DefendingAIArt/comments/1girn5n/coffee_side_chat_with_ai/,Coffee side chat with AI...,"So, some context, I was drinking coffee this morning and looking at art section on a discord where I am being 'attacked' for supporting AI art  by using teh attached images - both generated by me. It is discord, and folks link images - anyways, I am pro - AI art. I ended up asking the people about why they hate AI art. The big two responses, in an art discord, are ""AI art is not art."" and ""AI art is theft"". So, I made coffee and simply did some drawing while using voice to talk to Claude. Here is what Claude said....

    Let's analyze this statement step by step:
    The statement ""AI art is not art"" can be broken down logically as:
    Subject: ""AI art"" (which itself contains the word ""art"")
    Predicate: ""is not art""
    This creates a logical contradiction because:
    If we accept something as ""AI art,"" we're already categorizing it as a type of art
    Then we're simultaneously saying this type of art is not art
    It's similar to saying ""blue chairs are not chairs""
    A more logically consistent way to express concerns about AI-generated images might be:
    ""AI-generated images are not traditional art""
    ""AI-generated images are not human-made art""
    ""AI-generated images should not be considered equivalent to human-created art""
    This appears to be a case where the language used creates a self-contradicting statement, even if the speaker's underlying sentiment (perhaps about the nature, value, or authenticity of AI-generated images) might have merit worth discussing.
    Would you like to explore what specific aspects of AI-generated images you're interested in examining?

So, Art is Theft was talked about, next. I asked if traditional artist copying a master to learn art theory was theft.

    Let's break this down further:
    The ""theft"" argument raises interesting parallels:
    Human artists have historically learned by copying masters
    Art students routinely copy famous works as practice
    Many famous artists have directly referenced or appropriated others' work
    Examples: Warhol's soup cans, Picasso's studies of Velázquez, countless Renaissance painters copying classical works
    Where the parallel gets complex:
    Human artists copying work:
    Generally develop their own style through the process
    Typically understand the techniques they're learning
    Usually create derivative works with intentional changes
    AI systems:
    Train on massive datasets
    Don't ""understand"" art in the same way
    Combine elements in ways that may closely mirror source material
    The logical conflict in the argument:
    If copying/learning from other art is ""theft,"" then much of human art history would be ""theft""
    If copying/learning from other art isn't ""theft"" when humans do it, then the issue isn't really about copying
    This suggests the real concern is about something else - perhaps:
    Attribution
    Compensation
    Creative intent
    Understanding of craft
    Economic impact on artists
    You raise a good point - framing it purely as ""theft"" oversimplifies what appears to be a more complex ethical and economic discussion about how we value and attribute creative work.

So, I asked if a LORA counts as learning a style. The whole derived work bit...

    That's a fascinating logical progression! Let's analyze this:
    A LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) model's behavior:
    It learns specific stylistic elements from a smaller dataset
    Creates a consistent, recognizable ""style""
    Functions somewhat similarly to how a human artist might develop their style after studying others
    The parallel with human artistic development:
    Human artists study others → develop unique style
    LoRA studies specific works → develops consistent style
    Both are derivative but become distinctive
    However, there's a key philosophical question:
    When a human artist develops a style, it's through conscious understanding and choice
    When a LoRA develops a style, it's through statistical patterns
    Does this difference matter for the ""theft"" argument?
    The logical resolution:
    If the core issue is about having a unique, consistent style that's different from the training data
    Then yes, a LoRA could potentially address some of the ""theft"" concerns
    It's more like an ""artistic descendant"" than a direct copy
    This suggests that LoRAs might represent a middle ground in the debate - they're clearly derivative (like much human art), but also develop their own consistent characteristics (like human artists do). What do you think about this comparison between human artistic development and LoRA training?

Anyways, the part that makes me want to share this delightful conversation with my phone. These seem to cover the trolls, upset artists, and ill-informed anti-AI folks. I feel the AI seems to have covered all their rage.

1girmj8,https://www.reddit.com/r/Anger/comments/1girmj8/i_am_surrounded_by_idiots_and_that_stacks_up_the/,I am surrounded by idiots and that stacks up the anger quite fast,"Sorry, this is a long post, full of venting as well. And I'm also one of these people who needs to describe everything in details as I'm always afraid of people not getting the full context. But I guess writing in here will hopefully help me sharing my experience with like-minded people. For context I am male,39.

I am not a violent person, I could never filter my anger on taking physical harm against someone else. I'm all peace. However, it does not mean I don't feel anger. I do, and whenever I start getting angry at someone I started boiling plans on how I can get back to them, revenge either by saying nasty words and humiliating them or trying to cause some damage somehow (embarrassing them in front of someone or compromising their job, whatever as long as it does not get back to me). This doesn't happen often, only when the person does me wrong.

In fact I'm a super nice guy in general. I go beyond and above my ways to help people and be kind to them. But I guess some people see that as a weakness and try to take advantage of you and that's when it makes me mad the most.

So this past month I'd say it has been crazy the amount of IDIOTS that contribute to the state I am now.

Idiot #1 : this guy at work is absolutely worthless. Doesn't deliver at all and compromises the thing for the entire team. And seeing him trying to bs his way through it gives me second-hand embarrassment because he's so bad at lying. Well, he only gets me slightly annoyed with his incompetence but it's not the end of the world. In fact, it's even an advantage for me as since we have the same role in the company, he makes me look extremely competent and awesome by just doing the bare minimum lol. But yeah, working with someone so stupid, from time to time gets into you

Idiot #2: we had a road trip a month ago. My boyfriend and me paid most of the stuff : gas, airbnb, groceries and we just agreed to share all the cost later between us, and the other 3 friends that went. One of those friends is a guy who studies with me at uni. He just recently moved into the country and because of that he does not have setup yet a bank account and the phone payment system everyone in here uses. I said it's no big deal. He can either paypal me or give in cash. He said ""I'll pay you this week"" . 2 weeks have been gone and not only no payment from him to me and my boyfriend but also just silence, not a word. I know he's not gonna scam me, he's from Japan...Japanese people are all about their honor lol. But then, what's up bro? Give me some news or something. I had to do the unpleasant task of reminding him about the payment. Apparently he also had issue with paypal to confirm his identity to do an international transfer and was too embarrassed to say something or whatever. But c'mon...be smart, dead silence is NOT the solution. It just makes everything weird

Idiot #3: Another guy in my class, I am doing assignment with (the teacher selects the pairs). On a master's degree programme and this guy is absolute worthless too. Doesn't know basic stuff, doesn't know how to write a report. Then I spend more time trying to helping him catch up and that slows me down. So still, because I'm nice, I take my time to go meet him at uni, so we can sit together and I explain stuff to him. I don't have to do that, I have a full time job, together with a full time master degree, I'm hella busy. And then he's texting on his phone with his girlfriend while I'm sitting there doing stuff and explaining things to him? Man, I can do this shit with my eyes closed from home, but Im here wasting my time for you and you're involved in some drama with your greasy girlfriend that I couldn't care less? F\*\*\* you (here, the anger is building up again)

Idiot #4: planning a trip with my husband, I basically have to do all the planning otherwise he'll fuck up something...book wrong date of airbnb, forget some bus we need to book...whatever...and if I do ask him to take care of it, he'll confirm every little step of the way with me and ask a thousand questions (because he knows he'll fuck up). It's really annoying. But hey, he's my husband I loved him and I dedicate extra patience with him

Idiot #5: Last month I booked a vet consultation for my recently adopted cat but during the day of the trip to the vet I had issues taking him there (he's still not trusting humans and don't let people grab him to put in the carrier) . So I asked the vet if they had a suggestion of in-house visitation to which they did and suggested me to call this other vet. So I did. I explained her the situation. Then she came all the way and she wasn't able to do shit because surprise surprise, the cat got super stressed around her and did not let her touch him. And she acted surprise on that and in the end couldn't proceed with the plan to collect samples from him. But charges us for the visit anyway. Are u stupid? The whole reason to call you was because we can't handle the cat so we would expect you had a plan for that. We managed with another clinic to get a proper consultation and luckily the cat was fine, but yeah...the wasted money on that in-home visit...

Idiot #6: I saw a guy on a fb community. He comes from the same country as me and is struggling with money and was looking for anything, any kind of work that would give him some financial relief on his studies here. Since I have the means to help I thought about having him as our catsitter for when we are away for an upcoming trip.And I'd pay him much more than a catsitter would charge. So I messaged him about it. He agreed and was happy. Of course I'd want to meet him first, to get to know the person who'd take care of my cats. We went for a coffee, I explained the ins and outs of what to do and etc. Everything normal. This we were doing well in advance, about 4 weeks before my trip. I wanted him to come to my place to see some practical stuff and also get the key. His communication was slow but finally we manage to schedule for him to come on the weekend, 5 days prior to the trip. Dude got on the wrong bus , despite of me giving exact directions and bus number to my place (don't you know how to use maps?) . Arrived 40 min late which made me cancel another commitment. Once here, I explained everything, gave him the key. Everything seemed fine. Then next morning I get a message from him saying he wouldn't be able to help because apparently ""my place is too far"". How stupid are u? I gave u my address right in the first interaction and asked if this was okay. You said yes . I spent my time messaging you, discussing arrangements, waiting and explaining things for you when you were here at my place, which at that point he probably already decided to bail, but it is still wasting our time anyway. Now I'm fucked and have 4 days to find someone in a hurry. Not only , I have to probably skip one class or work hours during the week to get my key back from this idiot. This one really takes the cake and I really want to say something nasty to him when I meet him this week to get the key back. His nonchalant attitude towards all of it as if it's no big deal makes it even worse.

So yeah, this has been what my past weeks have been about. One idiot after the other, making my blood slowly boil and really making me wanna switch to interact with cats only rather than people. No more being the nice guy. No more helping people",1,1730653479.0,Anger,0,1.0,False

She went missing back in February and they found her body in May (both of this year). We don’t know exactly what but it’s very clear that she had some underlying mental health issues. Anyway, my dad (51) has been seeing this one lady I’ll call L, he hasn’t been very serious but lately he’s been telling my brother (23) and I (f17) that he’s been going to hang out with his friends when really he’s been going out and having dinner with L. this is bothered my brother the most just because he hasn’t been at home, but hasn’t really bothered me until very recently. It started bothering me when he asked me if I would like to carve pumpkins with L and her son (10), I said I didn’t really want to and he responded with “Sorry I just want you to be apart of my life.”. that conversation then just dissolved into my brother telling my dad that we are not ready to have a new woman figure not even a year after my mom’s death and my dad guilt tripping my brother and I saying that he just wants to have friends over and live his life. For a little context, this happened the day that my brother and I were going to Halloween horror nights, and he told us that he did not want to go because it would be going late and he didn’t think he was up to it; come to find out that night he went and saw L. Now that brings us to yesterday when he gets home fairly late after telling us that he was going to go out with friends, when he walks in, I see he’s wearing the same hockey jersey that my mom used to always wear while she was working (she worked from home). I didn’t outright know that he was going out with L that night, but I had a sneaking suspicion. come to find out when my dad and I grab coffee this morning. He talks about how instead of going out to eat, he just cooked them (L and him) a steak instead. At this point, I’m just feeling a mix of anger and sadness. For reference, we haven’t even had my mom’s celebration of life yet because of how tragically and unusually she passed.

1girjdt,https://www.reddit.com/r/Subliminal/comments/1girjdt/what_is_best_energy_subliminal/,What is best Energy subliminal?,"I've been trying to stay awake all night for a very long time. I remember being able to stay awake all night to complete my ELA project but that was for 1 day. lately I've been only able to stay awake for half the night before immediately falling asleep. I remember after using this krystalized ""Forever Permanent Results"" subliminal paired with Cee's virtual coffee subliminal, I felt like I drunk 40 coffees. I would continuously tap my feet faster than I usually do, I felt a lot more awake, I had a lot more energy, and I would fall asleep at 9 pm only to wake up at 1 am in the morning.  This all lasted for 5 straight days until my allergies came in. That's when all my results disappeared, and I started to feel old. I took allergy pills the next morning to get my results back, but they never returned.  I tried listening to the same subliminals again, but they didn't work. I even bought good luck bracelets to make my desires known to the universe, but it still didn't help. I'm wondering if you guys could recommend me some good energy subliminal that you use. If you guys know some good subliminal boosters that have worked for you, I would totally love hearing about them. Thank you for reading this, I look forward to hearing from you guys!",2,1730653264.0,Subliminal,3,1.0,False

Recently, I’ve been dealing with severe stomach and dysautonomia issues, which worsened over two months, leaving me unable to sleep and struggling with tachycardia and balance problems. I decided to go to Ukraine to stay with my parents, who are doctors, for proper treatment. When I returned, I found my husband in a state of massive anxiety and tears—something I had never done seen before. He expressed that he felt abandoned during my illness, which made me feel terrible, but I had to focus on my health.

The next morning, I discovered all my belongings—my personal items and toiletries—were missing. Immediately, I sensed something was off. I confronted him and learned that while I was away, he had started talking to a 23-year-old girl from his gym, inviting her for coffee and chatting extensively. He even attempted to erase my presence from our home, claiming we had a difficult relationship. The only thing that stopped him was the Ukrainian flag in my scarf, which made him realize how wrong he was.

He insists he wants to be with me and only loves me, but I’m at a loss. Our relationship was perfect; we were best friends and supported each other unconditionally. This betrayal is incredibly painful.

1giri8i,https://www.reddit.com/r/libraryofshadows/comments/1giri8i/the_jacket/,The Jacket,"Alex was miserable, dug so deep in a state of utter depression that he barely knew who he was anymore. His identity was so deeply entwined with Courtney that living without her genuinely felt like a disability. Moving listless through the clothing racks of the mom and pop thrift shop, Alex sifted through pants, shirts, and jackets shopping for a new personality. If he could just crawl into someone else's skin, maybe he could forget, or atleast dull the jagged, broken glass feeling in his chest.

Speaking of jackets… that one isn't bad. It was a well worn, but stylish red leather jacket. It had everything, studs, shoulder epaulets, and damn, it's double breasted too. This was exactly what Alex was looking for. He could see himself popping his collar, walking in to a coffee shop, and chatting up some cute batista.

And the price tag, at only $20, he couldn't not get it. In a rush, Alex didn't even bother to check the size. He just knew that this jacket would fit in every way. $20 lighter and one jacket heavier, Alex strolls out of the door. A strange energy flows through each step down the busy sidewalk. He comes up to the coffee shop, and right before going in, slides on the jacket.

It fits tight. Skin tight. Alex doesn't know how he got it all the way on, and doesn't know if he can get it back off either. That sense of energy intensifies. His confidence soars through the tiled ceiling. Sure in his plan to get over Courtney, He walks to the counter. The batista is a man today. Alex's disappointment is somehow short lived as he notices the man's sharp features. 

His cute stubble, black hair slicked back under a hipster ball cap, damn, even the way that his apron fi… WHAT WAIT?! Alex turns around quickly without ordering leaving a confused… handsome… STOP!

“What was that? Those weren't my thoughts.” reasoned Alex.

He has always dated women, and cringed when his friends even played the peculiar past time of many a straight man, gay chicken.

“This break up has really got my head mixed up.”

Later that night, Alex sat restlessly on the couch. His mind not feeling comfortable in his skull. It felt crowded. Like a car with too many passengers. Alex decided the best thing to do would be sleep it off. If only he could get this DAMN jacket off! He attempted to extricate himself earlier, but to no avail.

Giving up, Alex popped a couple of Courtney's sleeping pills, and nodded off on the couch, missing the end of the big football game.

Alex woke up in bed, sunlight slapping his face and digging into his brain. Not his own bed? Had he gone out last night? Maybe he hooked up with his ex? Alex isn't sure how he'd feel about that. 

The damndest thing is, he was still wearing the jacket. 

“I'm going to have to cut this thing off of me” Alex muttered to himself.

Alex turned over to see the broad back and shoulders of a man beside him.

Man.

Bed.

Sleep.

Me, bed, man, sleep, me sleep in bed with man… I SLEPT WITH A MAN?!

Alex shot out of bed, naked from the waist down. He had just started to scour the room for his pants, when he noticed that throughout the ruckus he was making, The stranger didn’t so much as readjust. Getting out of his head for a second, Alex crept up to the figure mostly obscured with blankets. As he circled around to the front, he jerked back in shock. 

The man that he had been sleeping beside was extremely dead. Not partially dead, might be dead, or even close to dead. There was one butter knife for each eye, jammed so far in that only half of the handles were showing. Now that Alex thought about it, those handles looked like silverware that he had purchased 2 years ago with Courtney at good homes when they had moved in together.

Alex’s stomach twisted, and he threw up right there on the carpet. 

“What did I do?” Alex said to himself, still gagging on his own sickness. 

“What do I do now?”

Calling the police didn’t seem like much of an option. He didn’t know if he was guilty of anything, but in the words of Maverick from “Top Gun”, “It doesn’t look good.”

Alex found his things, pulled up his pants, then stopped.

“Should I… clean up?” He wondered aloud.

The scene really didn’t look good for him, compounded by the healthy dose of DNA he just spewed all over the floor. Well, Alex was no maid, and he sure as hell wasn’t some Dexter type. Ultimately he decided to get the fuck out of dodge and pretend like this didn’t happen. Stumbling out of the apartment, Alex made his way to the elevator, praying that no one saw him. There was this feeling, besides the panic, that wasn’t quite right. His head felt… stuffy? Maybe it was a hangover from the sleep pills. Now that he thought about it, He isn’t 100% sure what the pills were. Maybe That’s what caused him to black out. All that to say, he felt like shit and needed to get off of the street.

“I haven’t had that much fun in decades.” Thought Alex.

Alex froze in place, a cold shiver creeping up his spine, the thought still echoing in his mind. It was as if someone was standing close behind him, but that wasn’t quite right. Standing impossibly close. Almost inside of him.",3,1730653195.0,libraryofshadows,0,1.0,False

Also the actual thing youre ordering aside, does the server come up to each of us in a sit down restaurant (in canada) and give us each the debit machine...because thats how it works in canada usually.

The chat went OK - ended up being more interview questions - but it's been a week and a half and I still haven't received any update since then on if I've got the job or have been rejected. 

I really thought that I had good chances with this job based on the invite for a post-interview coffee chat, but now I'm not sure - should I expect that I've been rejected, or is it likely that I'm still in contention for the job?

Context: about ten hours in there is a lovely coffee scene between Rook and Lucanis. Absolutely fantastic in every way. It's cute, romantic, very well written and has some subtle flirtatious options. THIS, was exactly what I was looking for in a romance with him. 

This. Was. The vibe.

Fast-forward another twenty hours of gameplay, I just completed the Bloodbath quest, and there's nothing. There has been nothing. No cute interactions or dialogue from him, no flirting, nothing! In the last twenty hours, I have flirted with Lucanis every chance that I could, and the man straight up isn't responding. 

This isn't slow-burn, it's no-burn.

And to be fair, I get the man has a lot going on. A lot of things that need to be dealt with. However, him not responding to the three or four flirting interactions in between the coffee date and now make no sense. Even turning me down and saying he has other priorities right now, would be better than the nothing I'm getting.

Also, I know the devs said there was variety in the relationships and some would be steamier than others. To be clear, I don't care if this isn't, ""one of the steamier relationships."" I don't need steam, I need reciprocation on even the barest level and there is none. 

Anyone else feeling frustrated here? I know I came into this with certain expectations, but come on y'all...

Tl;Dr My feelings are hurt cause I'm thirty hours into this game, and the romance with Lucanis is basically dead and non-reciprocul. What are your thoughts?",9,1730652942.0,dragonage,14,0.85,False

I left the country at the time and she had suggested a long-distance relationship which I apparently refused ( she recounted this to me again last night). By her own admission she is terrible at letting things go which is probably the I lying reason we have managed to stay in touch all these years.

After these 4 years I have returned to her country. We both very much wanted to meet up again and catch up. In the fresh autumn air we walked and talked and went in and out of cozy coffee shops and restaurants and shopping malls. We laughed and joked and spoke deeply too about what our lives were now and what would have maybe been if I had made a different decision. I admitted to being immature and taking for granted the efforts she was prepared to put into a relationship with me. We share very different passions now and have grown in different directions.

She has a house with her boyfriend now. They go dancing together at a ballroom on weekends and are slowly planning the rest of their life together. I am alone and am likely to be that way for some time yet. I focus on exercise and my career. Things she does everything she can to avoid thinking about too much.

Meeting her was always bitter sweet but I as her train left at the station I shed a tear or two while I waved goodbye and strangers crowded around the platform.

1gircv1,https://www.reddit.com/r/Healthix/comments/1gircv1/the_journey_to_balanced_blood_sugar_a_gluco6_story/,The Journey to Balanced Blood Sugar: A Gluco6 Story,"In the small town of Maplewood, nestled in the heart of Missouri, lived a spirited woman named Lisa. At 45, she found herself grappling with the challenges of managing her blood sugar levels. Working as a nurse, she was acutely aware of the health implications diabetes could impose, not only for her but also for her patients. Lisa often felt fatigued and irritable, especially after indulging in her favorite desserts. Determined to regain control of her health, she began her quest for a solution.

One evening, while scrolling through a health forum, Lisa stumbled upon Gluco6. It was a dietary supplement touted as a natural alternative for managing blood sugar levels, combining a blend of powerful ingredients like berberine, chromium, and cinnamon extract. Intrigued, she decided to dive deeper into user reviews and complaints. What she found was a mixed bag of experiences—some users swore by its effectiveness, while others expressed frustration over inconsistent results.

Curious yet cautious, Lisa shared her findings with her close friend, Marcus. At 50, Marcus had his own struggles with blood sugar management and had been experimenting with various supplements for years. Over coffee one morning, they discussed Gluco6 in depth. “I’ve heard about its ingredients,” Marcus said, “like alpha-lipoic acid and gymnema sylvestre. They’ve been linked to improved insulin sensitivity.” Lisa nodded, but she also shared her concerns. “But what if it doesn’t work for me? I can’t afford to waste money on another supplement that doesn’t deliver.”

Despite her reservations, Lisa decided to take the plunge. After consulting her healthcare provider, she purchased a bottle of Gluco6, hopeful yet anxious. As the days turned into weeks, she committed to taking the supplement daily, pairing it with healthier meals and regular exercise. The initial days were a mixed experience; while she noticed slight improvements in her energy, she also experienced some gastrointestinal discomfort, just as some reviews had warned. “I guess it’s part of the adjustment,” she thought, reminding herself to be patient.

[Gluco6](https://preview.redd.it/2euv7no9vpyd1.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=3d7e962e6483a1d6b24786d37db2c8d4cd65b62b)

Four weeks later, Lisa visited her doctor for a routine check-up. She eagerly awaited the results of her blood work, nervous yet excited. When her doctor entered the room, he wore a smile. “Your blood sugar levels have stabilized significantly!” he exclaimed. “What have you been doing differently?” Lisa beamed, sharing her experience with Gluco6. Her doctor nodded approvingly, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy lifestyle alongside any supplement.

As Lisa continued her journey with Gluco6, she noticed even more improvements. Her mood lifted, and she felt empowered to share her experience with others. She started a blog to document her health journey, emphasizing the importance of community support and personal accountability. On her blog, she included stories from fellow users who had found success with Gluco6, such as a young man named Ethan from California who had significantly lowered his fasting blood sugar levels after just a few weeks.

However, Lisa remained grounded, acknowledging that not everyone had a positive experience. She recalled a comment from her blog reader, Janet, who had tried Gluco6 and faced challenges with delayed results. “It’s vital to manage expectations,” Lisa wrote in her blog post. “What works for one person may not work for another. Consult your healthcare provider, and remember that supplements are just one piece of the puzzle.”

One day, while grocery shopping, Lisa bumped into Marcus, who had also been trying Gluco6. “How’s it going?” she asked. Marcus grinned, “I think it’s finally working! I’ve noticed a drop in my energy crashes during the day.” They exchanged tips on how to pair the supplement with their meals, emphasizing the importance of a balanced diet rich in fiber and lean proteins.

As the months rolled by, Lisa and Marcus became advocates for Gluco6 in their community, sharing their stories at local health fairs and engaging with others on social media. They learned to celebrate small victories together, from cooking healthier meals to motivating each other to exercise regularly. “It’s about making lifestyle changes that stick,” Lisa often reminded her followers.

In their journey, both Lisa and Marcus encountered varying opinions about Gluco6. Some found it to be a financial strain, while others were thrilled with the results. They made it a point to remind their readers that while Gluco6 had worked wonders for them, it wasn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. “Just like any journey to better health,” Lisa wrote, “it’s about finding what works best for you and your body.”

By sharing their experiences, Lisa and Marcus created a supportive community where individuals could exchange stories, insights, and encouragement. They emphasized the significance of listening to one’s body and consulting healthcare professionals before starting any new supplement regimen.

As Lisa looked back on her health journey, she realized how far she had come. Gluco6 had become more than just a supplement for her; it symbolized her commitment to health and well-being. And in the heart of Maplewood, a vibrant community blossomed, united in their quest for balanced blood sugar and healthier lives, proving that sometimes, the right support and a little guidance can make all the difference.

Hey everyone,

Longtime lurker, first time poster. I was looking for a NIOD specific sub but couldn't find one so here I am. I really want to try some NIOD products but could really use your help in how to incorporate them into my AM and PM routines. My skin is dry, I live in New England and am 45 years old (that crept up on me fast) fwiw. Please bear with me as I type this on my phone before I've had my morning coffee. Here's my current routine:

AM Cleanse with Prequel Gleanser Regimen Lab Vitamin X Regimen Lab Wave Serum Aestura Atobarrier 365 Cream Sunscreen and Makeup

PM Double cleanse with DHC Cleansing Oil and Regimen Lab Tabula Rasa Regimen Lab Level Serum Regimen Lab Wave Serum Aestura Atobarrier 365 Cream

A couple of nights a week I use Tara Harper Resurfacing Serum in place of the Level Serum.

What I'm interested in trying from NIOD are: FECC, CAIS, SDSM,Survival 0, Myrrh Clay Mask and NEK. I have also used TO Niacinamide + Zinc in the past and really liked it. Any help you can offer with how to incorporate NIOD into my existing routine would be most appreciated. Thank you 😊",1,1730652562.0,TheOrdinarySkincare,1,1.0,False

Last week, Crystal asked someone if they wouldn’t mind helping out the moderators and the person responded that they thought the moderators were doing a good job and would help out simply by pointing out comments that were missed. Crystal started treating that person badly and they reminded her that they didn’t want to be a moderator in the first place . Crystal then removed them as per their request but the following day when they joined the live, they were immediately blocked. Crystal said that that person was playing both sides, but the truth is Crystal doesn’t have any use for someone that won’t  be bossed around, so in true Crystal fashion, she cut them off 🤡

Crystal is the one who talks shit about us on her live stream, but runs to the page to beg for forgiveness! 

Also, the videos showing Melissa and Alyiah saying what they wanted to do to Crystal have been removed because Crystal couldn’t  resist sending droves of people to this page to harass us. She failed to articulate that we did not make those offensive statements, and we were being included in the backlash. The videos will be posted to their new home so that people can watch and share without being associated with this page. The video will now have a chance to reach a much broader audience, so there’s that. 

For the record, no one in this group participated in those threats, in fact, we condemned them. 

While I wish those statements were never made about another human being, I also recognize that Crystal is not an angel. She’s an awful human being who treats people like they are disposable. She has been dry-begging again over the last few days for pizza, wishlist items, coffee syrups, and Christmas presents. She’s also clearly changing the narrative in situations to suit her, and has no problem lying about innocent people 🤥

I'm wondering if anyone has ideas or suggestions for me. I’ve been in therapy for a couple of months, and one big topic that keeps coming up is my fear of being seen.

For a long time, I thought this was just who I was, and over the years, it’s shown up in some pretty nasty ways. Like, I’d change how I looked, forcing myself to fit a certain image, hoping I’d feel more “worthy” of being noticed if I looked a certain way.

But it’s not just about looks. I think this fear goes way deeper, and a big part of it is many years of hiding my real feelings and quirks to be this ""perfect,"" edited version of myself. I got so used to keeping everyone else comfortable, filling in the gaps, and smoothing over situations, and as an adult, I can see now that this was my attempt to control my environment and keep my own nervous system in check. I guess you could call this masking, since this mindset followed me into adulthood and pretty much everywhere else.

I told my therapist that I’d been doing this for so long that I wasn’t sure I could handle actually being noticed. Then she said something that really shifted things for me: “Your capacity for being seen or anything else for that matter isn’t fixed. You can stretch it, little by little, until it becomes more comfortable.”

That idea resonated with me. It gave me a visual, making it feel less like I’d be doing something foreign or unnatural, and more like I would just be stretching an ability I already have.

So, I’m starting this little challenge for myself, trying to step outside my comfort zone every day, even if it’s in really small ways. Here’s what I have so far. Some of these might seem tiny, but for me, they’re actually big steps! I like having a range so I can push myself a little more on days I feel up to it:

 - Wear my hair up to work
 - Wear a dress to work
 - Get breakfast alone at a café
 - Meet someone new for coffee (friend or date)
 - Share a personal detail with someone at work
 - Join a group conversation at work
 - Compliment someone at work
 - Compliment a stranger
 - Go to an exercise class alone
 - Try a new makeup look
 - Join a club
 - Go swimming at the beach alone
 - Wear interesting earrings to work
 - Let someone else take a photo of me
 - Post a picture on Instagram

I’m building this list to have a range of challenges to choose from, and honestly, I’m excited to see where it leads. If any of you have ideas for small ways to be braver and just… more myself each day, I’d love to hear them.

1gir001,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/1gir001/advice_needed_how_to_navigate_texting_every_dayas/,Advice needed: how to navigate texting every day…as friends ,"I went on a first date with a man this summer, and ever since that first date, we’ve chatted every day. On the first date, he shared that he was getting out of a recent-ish LTR and didn’t want to jump into a relationship soon. I was cool with that because I was just trying out the dating world for the first time and I’ve also grieved a LTR. 
After a few more dates, my anxiety spiked around his ex since they have a shared owned condo (he doesn’t live there anymore, she does) and he still invests financially in that property and stays at the property when she’s out of town to take care of it and also as an excuse to be in town and hang with his friends/community (and me!) (post break-up he moved out of town and away from his community). We decided it was too triggering for me, and he wasn’t far along enough in the grieving process, and that we should just be friends. 
Since then, we’ve grown into a really nice friendship. We’ve hung out a few times, strictly platonically, over the past few months, and we continue to chat every day (some texting throughout our days, some phone calls during the month). I’ve truly enjoyed our friendship and it feels very wholesome (we encourage each other, chat about silly things, explore deeper topics, and give each other advice). I’ve had to work through some more hopeful-romantic feelings I had for him, but when I put things in perspective (and communicate with him) I am able to see him for who he is, and where he’s at, and it’s not a place I need him to be to enter into a relationship. We continue to check-in about what this friendship means to us (it’s important to both of us), and what we both need it to be (platonic with honesty and boundaries). 
Anyway, latest update is I just saw him recently and we had a great time over coffee (he did not stay at the house, he stayed with some friends), but he hasn’t reached out in a few days which is so bizarre (he did send a “hope your day has been going well!”) after literally talking every. single. day. since summer. Just last week he was sending me videos from his bowling league’s games, as per usual. How should I interpret this? On one hand, I think it is a little much that we talk every day while not dating (how sustainable is that?), on the other hand, I miss hearing from him and connecting. Of course I know I should communicate this with him, which I will. Just wanted to gather some insight first. Thanks in advance! 

TL;DR: guy and I have been texting every single day since this summer and have gone from dating prospects to a solely platonic friendship because he is still grieving his ex. We connect on just about everything- our days, our feelings, goals, etc. He just stopped texting a few days ago out of the blue. What can this mean? ",1,1730651883.0,Advice,1,1.0,False

Here at 451 Spirits in Columbus we've recently released a couple new spirits at our distillery.  We've got our test batch of our coffee liqueur Death Before Decaf available as well as our first ever whiskey blend, Sling & Stone.

  
We would love for anyone interested to come on down and try these, we are looking for any feedback before getting the next batches ready.  Here are the details on each:

  
Death Before Decaf - Our intention was to design a better coffee liqueur.  We designed ours to be higher proof (33.3%) and lower sugar than other coffee liqueurs. The sugar content is 15 grams per liter vs Kahlua at just under 500 grams per liter.  It's quite a stark difference.  We wanted to pack as much coffee flavor in as possible while avoiding any additional additives or flavoring.  This is a simple liqueur made from spirit, coffee and sugar.  We are currently deciding if we should up the sugar for the second batch and may go a bit higher for a bit more sweetness and body but we've also gotten some good feedback about where the first batch is at.  We really value any opinions on this first batch so we can continue to dial this in moving forward.  And a big thank you to those that came out to the release to give this one a try, we really appreciate your support!



Sling & Stone - This is something totally new for us.  Our whiskeys for the last several years have traditionally been single barrel whiskeys that were distilled in house on our pot still.  Our distiller Chad respects the art of blending and wanted to put together a high quality blend that would pull from our whiskey stocks as well as blending in some sourced bourbon to create a blend that is greater than the sum of its parts.  I think he nailed it, the feedback we have gotten on this so far has been phenomenal.  The blend is comprised of three whiskeys, two distilled in house on our pot still and the third is a sourced bourbon (our first ever sourced whiskey).  Our intent is to keep Sling & Stone as a series where each release is a different blend either pulling from different stocks or in different ratios.  We would love feedback on this one as well as that will help guide us on the direction we go for the next batch.



If you are interested in stopping by, we are located at 590-ste. D, Oakland Park Ave, Columbus, OH 43214 (in the same building as India Oak).  Our bottle shop and tasting room is open from 2PM - 6PM today.

Look, I get it!  we've all been through stuff by our 30s. But man/woman, it's exhausting when every coffee date turns into an impromptu therapy session about your ex who cheated, or the one who ghosted you, or how all men/women are trash. I just want to geek out about that new book I'm reading, show you pictures of my struggling tomato plants, and maybe swap sourdough starter horror stories. You know, the fun stuff that makes getting to know someone actually exciting?

Here's the thing - we're all a little banged up from past relationships. But there's a huge difference between having lived through some stuff and dragging your unhealed wounds into every new connection. I want to hear about what makes your eyes light up, what you're passionate about, what makes you laugh until you snort your coffee. Not a blow-by-blow account of your last five relationships and why you have trust issues now. Take the time to heal. Go to therapy. Journal it out. Whatever you need. Because when you finally meet someone who wants to share their life with you , someone who could get just as excited about weekend farmers' market trips or binge, watching that new series, they shouldn't have to compete with the ghosts of relationships past.

PS: The OP is a man in 30s

However one thing I've noticed that the Weber does suffer from is that occasionally coffee grounds will get stuck in the holes are pretty hard to clean. Even with a high pressure faucet the grounds will remain in the holes. This issue is even greater when not using a paper filter. I believed that one of the videos is mentioned that the extraction yield us huge for commercial setting on the baskets like Weber. I think that's further from the truth because most shops wint use a paper filter and well without a paper filter enjoy a clogged basket..while non high extraction basket are less proned to grounds clogging the holes.

Bottom line is really that Weber basket is really if you are thinking you can ditch paper filter because Weber basket is ""high extraction"" you'll probably will have more issues with grounds clogging the basket.

I for myself have a Gaggia Classic and Fellow Opus as my daily setup at home, but when I visit my parents I'm ""forced"" to drink the coffee from their capsule machine, which made me wonder if it would be possible for them to maybe get a bean to cup. As I plan to sell them on the idea it would be great to have one to recommend. As for the criteria: 
1.reliable/ easy to use
2.compact 
3.decent taste/drink variations

They both love the coffee when they are over at my place but don't want all the effort associated with a proper espresso machine. They approximately drink a cup of coffee each in the morning. Another bonus having a bean to cup over the capsule machine would be the variance and quality of the coffee as well as some cost savings down the road (also less waste).

Maybe some of you have some experience or expertise to guide me.",1,1730651332.0,JamesHoffmann,0,1.0,False

I usually talk with women muna before we decide to meet up. But this was different, her front is to meet up agad.  
I was kinda surprised at first kase gusto agad nya makipag meet. Me being curious accepted it(what could go wrong).  
We met up in SM San Lazaro and she told me to wait in Ramen Nagi, waited for about 20 mins or less, we found each other and she immediately went in the restaurant.  
She ordered a ramen and karaage and I ordred a gyoza since I was still full.  
For context, I was planning to do a coffee meet up since its the first time, but i guess she wanted to eat.  
Lagi syang nakasimangot and keep on looking at her phone. I pay no mind and asked some few questions, small talks and received lackluster replies.  
So in my mind, this date is already kaput. Naisip ko nalang na tapusin nalang tong dinner and go home.  
We finished eating and she asked to get the bill ready.  
Pag dating ng bill, I asked her to split the bill. Bigla nyang sinabe saken na wala syang dalang pera and pumayag daw ako na ilibre ko sya. Which I am sure that I didnt, she was already gaslighting me at this point na I stopped caring and decided to pay it nalang instead para matapos na(ayoko na ng abala).  
After that ayaw nya munang umalis, but I was already pissed at this point. Ang nasa isip ko lang is, this match is a dud and a scam.  
I told her na I want to stand outside since were already taking up space and there is a line in Ramen Nagi and I dont want to hang around. In which she suddenly said na ""Tara na uwi na tayo?"". And I accepted.  
Pag labas namen sa Ramen Nagi she immediately parted ways.  
I immediately unmatched her in Bumble and other contacts such as Telegram.

At the start he was really heavy, constantly calling/texting and was very quick to tell me he was in love and I was his soul mate (like 1 week in). English is not his first language and I just assumed he used more flowery language than what I'm used to, but he was respectful when I asked to slow things down. Over the months things were really good, we'd cook together and gradually went to spending a lot of time together. Then, about 2 months ago he stood me up and messed up my whole weekend and work. After this we talked and I told him that my time is important to me and that I can't tolerate this behaviour, I made it clear that I can't accept it happening again. It happened again the following week, so I spoke to him to finish things and explained no hard feelings etc. All good - left  on good terms etc. and stayed in contact as friends. 

That is until last week when he reached out via text and phonecalls to say he was still madly in love with me. He sent photos of us together and said how much he missed me and that his friends/family had been asking about me. He asked if we could meet up when he gets back from visiting his home country - so would be meeting up in a week or so. He called just before the weekend and kept asking for me to come over to his house and stay. I declined and explained that if anything were to happen we need to start from the beginning (as in meet for coffee or lunch first). He seemed to respect this and we carried on chatting pretty regularly throughout the day. I sent him a message yesterday morning and I've had no reply, he's read the message, but nothing? I'm confused, why come on all hot and heavy just to ghost? I know it's only been a short time - 24hrs or so (I've not messaged again or anything). I know he could be busy, but I also know him well enough that he's glued to his phone and this is totally out of style. I certainly feel nervous to pursue anything further (I'm still giving a bit of benefit of the doubt in case there's a genuinely good reason). I'm just feeling a bit hurt. I've not dated anyone in 5 years after an abusive realtionship, so this was my first experience of dating again. What do you think happened? I just don't understand why reach out to me if you're not interested? I also know it could be my past experiences making me overthink. Did I do something wrong? Have I been a massive fool? Is this just part of modern dating? I just thought if something was up he knew me well enough that he can finish things maturely/respectfully. Is this something I should look out for in the future, and if so, what could be an indicator?

Tbh I’m not sure if that’s a good or bad sign. Is there anything I should do as I wait? Will I ever hear back or will I have to attend any events or meetings to hear back?

Thanks to anyone who read this much and for the advice!:)",3,1730650654.0,Sororities,1,1.0,False

So what if the energizing effect of caffeine being agitation / energy is actually that effect as well but in a really really small scale?

For reference I had a homemade coffee and one dunkin cold brew and I am walking like 15 million blocks to where I have to be right now.",1,1730650650.0,Caffeine_Use,0,1.0,False
