- Record 14% year-on-year increase in fintech startups, according to Forbes Business, with cybersecurity flagged as the top boardroom priority by 69% of surveyed CEOs.*\
Importantly, Bahrain’s government has doubled down on IT security and privacy law enforcement, introducing rapid-response measures and stricter data control mandates. The MOICT (Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Tourism) and EDB (Economic Development Board) have rolled out digitized platforms—like the Sijilat portal—making company formation swifter, yet compliance checks more thorough. The result? A strong, opportunity-rich ecosystem—but only for the well-prepared.\
Surprisingly, Bahrain’s business culture blends ultra-modern efficiency with centuries-old customs. Ramadan brings adjusted hours and warm pre-meeting rituals, yet documents move swiftly if you respect these rhythms. Having sipped countless tiny cups of bitter coffee waiting for approvals in the Diplomatic Area, my advice? Build relationships first, processes second.\

\
Bahrain Company Formation: Cybersecurity Requirements Front-and-Center\
\
Alt text: Business structure and collaboration in a team meeting., expect to encounter the Personal Data Protection Law (PDPL, Law No. 30 of 2018) at every turn. This law, updated in January 2025, tightly governs how companies collect, process, store, and disclose personal data.\
Why Is This Especially Relevant for Entrepreneurs?\
Bahrain is now a magnet for fintech, e-commerce, and digital health startups aiming for rapid regional scale. The government offers:\
* 100% foreign ownership in most sectors\
* Streamlined Sijilat registration through the MOICT\
* Attractive free zone packages\
* Financial support via Tamkeen\
But with digital opportunity comes digital responsibility. Even minor data breaches can trigger fines, loss of license, and public trust issues—especially given Bahrain’s close-knit business community.\
\
Data Breach Reporting Requirements Under Bahrain’s PDPL (2025)\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation in a regulatory context. ""without undue delay"" (legally interpreted as within 72 hours).\
- Include nature of the breach, categories and number of affected data subjects, likely consequences, and mitigation efforts.\
- If notification occurs later than 72 hours, you must justify the delay in detail.\
Personal aside: My first breach test drill took place during peak Ramadan season—the LMRA office was only open until 2pm, senior signatories were fasting, and coordination slowed to a crawl. Solution: Pre-drafted templates, digital-only sign-offs, and setting notification deadlines 24 hours earlier than the legal minimum—just to be safe.\
Informing Data Subjects\
\
If a breach is likely to result in a high risk to data subjects’ rights and freedoms, you must also inform those individuals directly and “promptly”.\
Communication must be clear, plain-language, and offer steps for individuals to protect themselves (e.g., password changes, fraud monitoring).\
\
Record-Keeping and Accountability\
\
Maintain written records of all data breaches, including cause, impact, and remedial action—even for minor or “non-reportable” incidents.\
Be ready for random audits: the PDPA has increased spot checks by 27% in 2025.\
\
Penalties for Non-Compliance\
\
Fines now reach up to BD 20,000 per incident.\
Repeat or willful violations can lead to license suspension or criminal prosecution.\

Step-by-Step Guide: Complying With Breach Reporting in Bahrain\
\
Alt text: Business process and documentation: paperwork and office workflow. or responsible manager—mandatory for companies handling “large scale” or sensitive data.\
- Time-saving tip: Outsource this role to a qualified local compliance firm for BD 300–500/month if you don’t have in-house expertise.\
2. Draft and Regularly Update Internal Protocols\
\
Pre-approve breach notification templates in English and Arabic.\
Keep checklists for required notification content and escalation contacts.\
Preparation shortcut: Use online Sijilat document templates and pre-fill company data fields.\
\
3. Incident Detection and Initial Assessment\
\
Monitor for unusual access or activity (set up log alerts via your IT provider).\
Assess severity within 24 hours. If personal data is at risk, escalate immediately.\
\
4. Notify the PDPA\
\
Submit notification via the official PDPA online portal.\
Attach security incident reports, risk assessments, and contact logs.\
Timing tip: Avoid submitting just before weekends (Friday/Saturday in Bahrain) or public holidays—PDPA staffing is limited and follow-ups may be delayed.\
\
5. Inform Affected Individuals (If Required)\
\
Send a concise, actionable email/SMS outlining the breach and recommended steps.\
Arabic-language versions are strongly advised.\
\
6. Document Every Step\
\
Log all decisions, communications, and remediation efforts.\
Store securely for a minimum of five years.\
\
Challenge overcome:\
On my second breach response case, I discovered our client’s firewall logs were all in English, but the PDPA required critical explanations in Arabic. We hired a certified translator on retainer—costing BD 120 for urgent translation, saving us a week of back-and-forth and preventing a potentially costly compliance slip.\
\
Cost Considerations: Budgeting for Compliance\
\
Alt text: Financial planning and costs in a Bahrain business context.: Expect BD 500–1,500 for standard Sijilat registration, plus:\
  * Cybersecurity audits: BD 350–2,000 (depending on company size)\
  * DPO services: BD 300–500 per month (outsourced)\
  * Legal review of PDPL policies: BD 250–1,000\
  * Training and policy docs: BD 100–500 per year\
Money-saving insider tip:\
Choose office locations in the Seef District or Bahrain Bay for faster Sijilat counter service—queues are shorter, and you’ll find more English-speaking staff. Best time to submit applications is Sunday morning (after the weekend), avoiding mid-week rush and public holiday bottlenecks.\
And if you’re registering during Ramadan, bring snacks and water—queues may move slow, but the spirit of helpfulness from MOICT staff is always high.\
\
Compliance Challenges: Common Mistakes (and How to Avoid Them)\
\
Alt text: Legal compliance and documentation: contract signing.\
- Streamlined, digital-first notification process\
- Pro-business, open-ownership company formation (see more)\
Combined with lower formation costs, smoother regulatory interactions (seriously, try the Bahrain Bay EDB building for friendly staff), and a tradition of personal accountability, Bahrain sets a high but fair bar for data protection.\
\
2025 Regulatory Changes: What’s New for Data Breach Reporting?\
Effective March 1, 2025:\
- PDPA online breach reporting system introduced—no more paper-based forms.\
- Shorter investigation response times: PDPA must acknowledge notifications within 48 hours.\
- Stricter sanctions on repeat offenders, including mandatory compliance training for directors.\
- Updated definition of “high risk” to cover biometric and location data.\
Practical implication:\
Faster turnaround, clearer audit trails, and an increased chance of random compliance checks—especially for startups in regulated sectors (fintech, health tech, e-commerce).\
\
Insider Resource Recommendations\
For startups without in-house legal teams, I highly recommend Bahrain-based compliance consultancies such as Gulf Data Trust or KeyLink Advisory, link to accounting & compliance service—they blend local regulatory know-how with international standards.\
Also, the official Sijilat portal is a goldmine for the latest forms, and Tamkeen’s SME support hotline is surprisingly responsive (especially if you call first thing on a Sunday).\
\
FAQ: Bahrain Data Breach Reporting & Business Cybersecurity\
Q1: What are the first three steps I must take if my company suffers a data breach in Bahrain?\
\
Appoint your DPO or compliance lead to investigate within 24 hours.\
Assess whether the breach impacts personal data as defined by the PDPL.\
Notify the PDPA via its online portal within 72 hours, using approved templates in both Arabic and English.\
See formation process details\
\
Q2: Are data breach notification requirements different for companies in Bahrain Free Zones?\
No. PDPL applies equally to all Bahrain-registered entities, including free zone companies. However, free zone administrative staff often provide compliance guidance—don’t hesitate to ask during onboarding. Learn more about free zones here.\
Q3: What happens if I miss the 72-hour deadline?\
Late notifications must be justified in detail. Repeated delays may lead to higher fines (up to BD 20,000 per incident) and increased audit scrutiny. Avoid this by prepping templates, assigning clear roles early, and setting 48-hour internal deadlines.\
Q4: What company types are most exposed to data breach risks in Bahrain?\
Fintechs, digital health companies, and e-commerce platforms face higher risk due to volume and sensitivity of data handled. For a breakdown of entity types and exposure, see Bahrain business structures.\
Q5: Where can I find reliable help for PDPL compliance and ongoing support?\
\
KeyLink Advisory’s compliance support\
Bahrain’s PDPA official website\
Local legal and IT consultancies experienced in PDPL matters\
\
\
Final thought:\
In Bahrain, solid breach reporting isn’t just about avoiding fines—it’s about preserving the strong reputation and trust that drives business forward in this remarkable Kingdom. And never underestimate the power of a well-timed coffee and a friendly conversation in the waiting room—sometimes, that’s where the best compliance advice is born.\

*The real, emotional journey of someone who thought it would stay a secret.*

I never expected my aunt to be the first person who saw *that* side of me.  
The one I had kept buried under old shame, online searches, and quiet, middle-of-the-night experiments.

It started simply.

She was cleaning out her attic. Asked if I could help. I agreed — mostly because I had nothing else going on. Twenty-eight, unemployed, and crashing with her for “a few weeks” that had turned into months.

The attic was full of old boxes, vintage furniture, and layers of dust. Nothing too exciting… until I found the trunk.

It was floral. Heavy. Old. The kind of trunk that felt like it *should* have secrets inside.

I opened it, expecting maybe photos or blankets.

Instead, I found a dress.

Blue. Vintage. Puffed sleeves. A white apron. Something out of a children’s book — or a dream I hadn’t let myself admit.

“Try it on,” my aunt said casually from across the attic. She said it with a smile. No mockery. Just playful curiosity. “It used to be mine when I was your age. I want to see if it still fits someone.”

I laughed it off. Made a joke. She made tea. We didn’t talk about it again that night.

But the dress stayed in my room.

And so did the idea.

# The First Time

I waited until the house was empty. Middle of the afternoon, blinds closed.

Putting it on wasn’t easy. I fumbled with the zipper. Felt awkward in my own skin. But when I looked in the mirror… something shifted.

It wasn’t sexual. It wasn’t a joke.

It felt like someone I had been holding in for years suddenly stepped forward and whispered, *“Finally.”*

I didn’t know what to do with that.

So I folded the dress up again, quietly, and tried to forget the feeling.

# The Setup

The next morning, my aunt placed the dress—freshly laundered—on the couch.

“I washed it for you,” she said, without looking up from her coffee.

I froze. She knew.

And she wasn’t mad. Or confused. Or laughing.

She just… knew.

“I invited some friends over later,” she added. “We’re having a little tea.”

I laughed, nervously. “Cool. Want me to help clean?”

She looked at me over her mug and said, gently, “I’d love if Alice joined us.”

# The Reveal

I don’t remember how I got myself into the dress that afternoon.

I only remember walking into the living room—and seeing them.

Six women. Middle-aged. Stylish. Glasses of wine in their hands. And every single one of them turned to look at me.

Smiling. Not cruelly. Just… *knowing.*

My cheeks went hot. My hands found my apron. I stood like a deer in headlights.

Then one of them said, “Oh my goodness, she’s *adorable.*”

And just like that, I was *Alice*.

They made me curtsy. Pour tea. Compliment their outfits.

I was shaking the whole time—but also, weirdly calm. Like something inside me had been cracked open, and the air rushing in wasn’t as cold as I feared.

# The Aftermath

That night, I sat on the porch with my aunt, the dress still on.

“It’s not just pretend, is it?” I asked her.

“No,” she said. “It never was.”

We didn’t say much after that.

But something between us was quiet… and whole.

# Why I’m Sharing This

This story isn’t a fantasy.

It’s not a performance.

It’s not about being “trapped” or “humiliated” for show.

It’s about a moment. A real one. Where shame met safety. Where curiosity met permission. And where I stopped hiding from myself — at least for a little while.

If you’ve ever tried on clothes when no one was looking…  
If you’ve ever been terrified of being seen, but *longed* for it too…

This story is for you.

My company hired a hotel conference room for 2 day event, a guest speaker was giving staff a workshop over 2 days. Our company paid hotel for room hire for 2 days. The speaker asked us to ask hotel to provide some extras which the speaker would pay for, tea/coffee.
One of our staff assisted the speaker on both days.
First day there were a lot of issues from hotel, room layout wasn't what was specified, tea/coffee didn't arrive at the agreed time, there wasn't enough provided and our staff member had to request correct amount for number of staff. Then there were other issues from hotel later that day and on day 2, so not a good experience overall.
The speaker and our staff member went to reception at end of day 2 to pay for the tea/coffee. Was told by reception staff an amount which was only for 1 day, both speaker and staff member said this was incorrect, it should be double the amount. The reception staff said on her screen that was the only amount showing as owed. So it was paid. Speaker asked again when given card machine receipt is that definitely all that is owed, is there anything outstanding, there was tea/coffee on both days. Reception staff again checked their screen and replied that's it, it's paid in full, nothing else owing.
Our staff member and speaker both then we feel reasonably assumed the hotel had discounted the tea/coffee from day 1 due to number of issues, delays and interruptions to the days event.
However the hotel has now been in touch to say tea/coffee for 1 day owing. Our company explained chain of events and stated our staff member and the speaker were advised nothing further outstanding. The hotel person that deals with Conferences says the discrepancy is because before the event started she hadn't ""posted"" the fees for teas for 1 of the 2 days to their system. Even though she had sent an invoice ahead of the event listing the teas for both days.
I'm honestly fed up with them.
Do I have to pay?
Legally? I know the teas were drank. But our staff member and the speaker both reported back that they were told nothing was left owing and genuinely believed it had been discounted as gesture of goodwill. They tried to pay full amount, they explained teas were provided both days.
The speaker who ordered the teas doesn't want to pay because she feels she asked what was owing, paid the amount she was told was due.
Our company didn't actually commit to paying for teas, as we only took responsibility for room hire, and we communicated to hotel we were only paying for room and speaker was paying separately for teas.
Is there such a thing as 'the payment was made as full and final settlement and your representative of hotel reception staff accepted this amount in full and final settlement'?
I don't want to have to find a solicitor to argue over the amount as solicitor fees would be more.
Any suggested wording to say mistake on their end, invoice was paid?",1,1757930628.0,legaladviceireland,0,1.0,False

I studied for about a month (\\\~50 focused hours). I already have an IT background, so I was somewhat familiar with the topics going in.

What Went Well  
\- Professor Messer’s YouTube videos – Free, clear, and an excellent overall overview.  
\- PocketPrep app – About €20/month, but very much worth it. The style of the questions was very close to the real exam, so I’d call it a great investment.  
\- Time management practice – I trained myself to answer questions quickly, which helped me finish the exam comfortably.  
\- Buying directly from CompTIA – No tax compared to PearsonVUE.  
\- Retake option – Highly recommend. It gave me peace of mind going in.  
\- Extra time for non-native speaker – I got additional time, though I didn’t end up using it. Still, knowing I had it kept me relaxed.

What I’d Do Differently  
\- Skip free practice tests  – I wasted \\\~10 hours on them, but they were nothing like the real exam. Better to stick with quality resources.  
\- Don’t start with PBQs – I spent \\\~40 minutes on them at the beginning, which left me stressed and exhausted. I’d save them for later.  
\- Learn basic CLI commands – Not heavily advertised, but very useful for some questions.  
\- No coffee before the exam – Big mistake. I had to pee 10 minutes in and ended up rushing toward the end. Never again.

It’s normal to feel like giving up halfway through. I definitely hit that wall and didn’t think I would pass until I clicked “submit.”

1nhhptl,https://i.imgur.com/c6xq2Tt.jpeg,How to Unf*ck your brain [Image],"I spent a solid chunk of the last 2 years feeling like my brain is totally f*cked. My energy was none existent. So, I researched a lot and tried a ton of stuff, and actually figured out how to fix my my brain again. I tracked everything and made notes each day on how I'm feeling.

Hope the following helps: 

(There are sections, but honestly, it all kinda works together.)

---
LEVEL 1: Nail these first

● SLEEP: 
- Dark room, cool temp, same bedtime. 

● HYDRATE: 
- Carry a water bottle. Drink it. All day. Headaches? Brain fog? Dehydration is a sneaky bastard.

●	SUNLIGHT: 
- 10-15 mins of morning sunlight (even through a window). Resets your internal clock. You can also get a light therapy lamp for dark winter days.

● MOVE YOUR DAMN BODY:
- Quick Walks: Clears the head, gets blood pumping.


Desk Stretches:
1.	Neck Tilts & Rotations
2.	Shoulder Rolls (Forward & Back): Release the hunch.
3.	Cat-Cow: Mobilize your spine.

*Seriously, 5 mins a few times a day makes a HUGE difference to blood flow and focus.*

● STAND UP MORE: 
- Sitting is brain-drain. Got a standing desk (better posture) and set timers to stand/stretch every few hours.

---
LEVEL 2: Things got really interesting for me.

- GET YOUR BLOOD CHECKED: Went to the doc, demanded comprehensive bloods. Low Vitamin D, B12, and borderline iron.

*Seriously, if you feel chronically shit, this is step one*

● FOOD INTOLERANCE:  
- Always had a weird stomach. Did a food intolerance test (get a decent one). Turns out, dairy and gluten were basically carpet-bombing my system with inflammation, making my brain feel like sh*t. 
If you gut is f*cked, your brain is fucked. 

● MOUTH BREATHING AT NIGHT: 
- Realized I was a mouth-breather in my sleep. Taped my mouth (sounds weird, look up ""mouth taping for sleep""). Sleep quality really improved

**IMPORTANT:**

If you think you might have sleep apnea, definitely consult your doctor before trying mouth taping, it could worsen the condition and, in rare cases, be life-threatening.

**Signs of sleep apnea to watch for:**

Loud, chronic snoring
Pauses in breathing during sleep
Excessive daytime sleepiness
Morning headaches
Waking up gasping or choking

---
LEVEL 3: Fix your brainrot

● COLD SHOWERS: 
- Started with 30 secs of cold at the end of my normal shower. Now up to 2 mins full cold. The energy you get from that is INSANE.

● GREEN TEA + L-THEANINE > COFFEE:
- Swapped my jitter coffee for green tea (or matcha) with an L-Theanine supplement. Clean, calm, focused energy. No 3 PM crackhead crash.

●	""DOPAMINE DETOX"" SUNDAYS (OR WHATEVER DAY):
- One day a week, minimal tech, minimal stimulation. Just be bored. First few weeks were actual hell. Now? My brain actually enjoys normal, non-hyper-stimulated life again.

● WIM HOF BREATHING: 
- 30 deep belly inhales, full exhales. After last exhale, hold breath (empty lungs) 1-2 mins. Deep inhale, hold 15-30 secs. Instant energy & clarity. Repeat 2-3x for full effect if you have time. 

**IMPORTANT:**
Wim Hof breathing isn’t recommended for people with high anxiety, since the intense sensations (like dizziness or rapid heartbeat) can trigger or worsen anxiety or panic. If that’s you, it’s better to start with gentler breathwork.

**Try this instead: Box Breathing (calming & safe):**

1. Inhale for 4 seconds

2. Hold your breath for 4 seconds

3. Exhale slowly for 4 seconds

4. Hold again for 4 seconds

Repeat for 2–5 minutes. It’s great for calming your nervous system and regaining control.



● CHEW GUM (WHEN YOU NEED TO FOCUS): 
- Sounds fake, but it surprisingly works for studying/deep work. Supposedly increases blood flow to the brain.

--- 
LEVEL 4: Fix Your Attention Span

● GRAYSCALE YOUR PHONE: 
- Best. Hack. Ever. Makes TikTok/Insta look as appealing as watching your granny undress. Zero desire to scroll.

● UNFOLLOW them: 
- Kept actual friends + maybe 5 accounts that actually teach me something. The rest? UNFOLLOW.

● APP BLOCKERS: 
- Blocked Reddit, Youtube etc. during focused work blocks.

● NOTIFICATIONS: OFF (MOSTLY): 
- Your brain doesn't need a damn ping every 5 seconds.

---
LEVEL 5: Supplements & Systems

● WORK SMARTER, NOT HARDER: 
- Work in focused 90-minute blocks, then take a REAL 15-20 min break (walk, stretch, stare out the window, NO phone.

● MAGNESIUM GLYCINATE (BEFORE BED): 
- Helped with sleep quality and overall chillness.

● OMEGA-3s (FISH OIL/ALGAE OIL): 
- Brains are fatty. Feed 'em good fats.

---
THE MOST OVERLOOKED FIXES:

●	FIX. YOUR. POSTURE: 
- Seriously. Hunching kills blood flow to your brain and gives you neck ache. Get yourself a standing desk / Laptop stand + decent chair + consciously sitting/standing taller

● GET YOUR EYES CHECKED:
- Had a tiny vision issue I ignored. New glasses = headaches GONE by 90%. Less eye strain = less headache.

Meanwhile, the total goals line sits at **3.5**, with Over priced at 2.2 and Under at 1.63.

**Why Feyenoord Will Win (Probably):**

1. **De Kuip’s New “Home” Advantage:** After Feyenoord’s ticket fiasco last week (fans climbing fences like Eredivisie escapees), the club promised a “solution” for this match. Translation: They’ll probably just sell tickets *after* kickoff. But hey, chaos breeds character—or at least a 1-0 win.
2. **Sem Steijn, the Golden Ticket:** The Dutch striker leads all scorers with 4 goals this season. His **goal anytime odds are -134**, making him a near-lock to score. If he doesn’t, the bookmakers might need to check his passport for evidence of time travel.

Earnestly I don’t really know what I’m looking for, right now I’m hoping to find someone who would like to meet up and grab a drink or a coffee. 

After that I’m open to suggestions haha. 

I’m a bit of an inexperienced guy, never really dated and the idea posting here is to talk and get to know someone who is okay being a bit more understanding that I’m a bit new to all this. Open to long term fun or just something casual. Doesn’t even need to require sex haha, a new friend would be nice.

I know this sub isn’t really for advertising dates and is more just straight hookups but I’d rather ease into things and get to know someone first. 

I can send a pic if you’re interested but I’m 5 10, short brown hair, medium build. I like to read, go to the movies, started working out recently, go for walks around the city. I’m a sociable, funny guy (I think) happy to chat and see if we’re a good match!

Recently, I thought I was healed so I decided to quit taking pills. But I was wrong. I was feeling the silence of nothingness again. So, I consulted my doctor and started to take pills again. While adapting pills, I drank at least 2-3 cups of coffee a day for a month. (americanos, lattes) I was preparing them at home as i got an espresso machine.  At the beginning, preparing, smelling and tasting the coffee was relaxing me. After the month, I got panicked with the derealization and went to emergency. The doctor prescribed a new medicine for the evenings. Then as I thought I drank too much coffee, I suddenly quit drinking coffee. Nowadays I'm having panic attacks and high anxiety. I have never been like this before. Do you think quitting coffee like this triggered me? I dont know what should i do. I even started to take therapy for derealization but as you know first week is like meeting and explaining your problems. ",1,1757930282.0,dpdr,1,0.99,False

So I’ve been thinking about this for a while now and wanted to throw it out there to see if anyone else feels the same way…

I’m thinking about starting a new group for students who just joined KU Leuven this year. I know there are already tons of societies and kringen around (and they’re honestly great!), but hear me out on why we might need one more 😅

The thing is - I’ve been to some of the existing meetups and it’s honestly pretty tough for an introvert shy Asian like me to really mix in with everyone, especially when you don’t dance or drink much. Plus, I’ve noticed that in a lot of these groups, there are already these tight-knit friend circles that formed over time, and if you’re not super extroverted, it can feel pretty hard to break into those existing groups.
What I’m thinking is maybe we could start something specifically for people who are genuinely starting fresh this year - no pre-existing friend groups, just new people trying to find their tribe. Maybe something more low-key where we can actually get to know each other without the pressure of having to be the loudest person in the room.
I’m imagining stuff like:

Casual coffee meetups

Board game nights

Maybe some outdoor activities when the weather’s nice

Study sessions at the library

If you’re someone who:

Just started at KU Leuven this year

Feels a bit overwhelmed by the big party scene

Wants to meet people but in a more chill way

Is tired of feeling like the outsider looking in

Actually wants to have real conversations with people

then maybe this could work?
I’m not trying to bash the existing societies at all - they do amazing work and lots of people love them! This would just be an alternative for those of us who need something different.

Drop a comment if this sounds like something you’d be interested in, or if you have any ideas about how we could make this work. Even if you’re not sure but just relate to what I’m saying, let me know - it helps to know we’re not alone in feeling this way!

Also, if anyone has suggestions for what we could call ourselves or where we could meet up, I’m all ears 👂


TLDR: Want to start a low-key friend group for new KU Leuven students who find it hard to break into existing social circles. Less partying, more genuine connections. Anyone interested?

P.S. - If you’re reading this and thinking “just be more social” or “just put yourself out there more” - trust me, I’ve tried! This isn’t about being antisocial, it’s about finding the right kind of social environment where we can actually be ourselves and connect with people who get it.",2,1757930179.0,KULeuven,2,1.0,False

So, one of my greatest fears has transpired into a reality: I've fallen for a guy who I've only ever met for coffee/gigs a couple of times. I have literally no idea if he is even gay/bi but I've been told by some mutual that he may have a gf. I hate that I feel such strongly about him, it's like the classic 'butterflies in your stomach' kind of feelings that I get around him. I know that this is completely teenage-girl vibes but I have been thinking about him all the time, obsessively checking my.phone to see if he has texted me back, obviously done a deep dive on all his sm, and I can't sleep or eat. I know that nothing will, or could happen, yet I still fantasise about being with him. It's not just attraction on a physical level, there is just SOMETHING about him that I cannot dislodge from my soul. I just love being around him. Has anyone else ever been through this?

### **Victory Car Wash**

The checkered flag above Victory Car Wash had once been bright enough to catch a driver’s eye from the highway. Now they were sun-bleached and frayed, snapping in the July wind like tired streamers at a forgotten party. The whole place smelled of wet soap, coffee from a cracked thermos, and the warm, metallic breath of engines cooling after a rinse.

Calvin liked it that way. The steady hum of vacuums, the hiss of hoses, the wet slap of chamois on paintwork — it was a rhythm, and he’d built a life inside it. Thursdays especially. Because every Thursday and Friday in the middle of the month, without fail, a silver BMW rolled in at 3:45 p.m., its driver in a pressed shirt and mirrored sunglasses, handing over the keys as if to a valet at a country club. The car was spotless even before they touched it. Calvin and the crew would exchange looks and go through the motions.

That Thursday his nephew Marcus had wandered in after school, smelling of chalk dust and sneakers.  

“Uncle Cal,” he whispered. “Kids at school say BMW’s the best. Is it true?”

Calvin chuckled, dunking a sponge back into the bucket. “Best at draining your wallet. Window switch goes bad, you pay what I make in a week. But it’s still just a car, Marcus. Same brake pads, same oil, same potholes.”

Marcus didn’t answer. He was still staring at the gleam of the chrome badge as the car rolled out of the bay. Calvin felt a prickle of recognition — that hunger he’d had at fifteen, before reality replaced posters on his bedroom wall.

That night, after the dinner dishes, Marcus tried again. “I just wanna sit in her. Just once. That’s all.” His voice was tentative, but his eyes were steady.

Calvin dried his hands on a dish towel. “It’s not ours,” he said automatically. Then, softer: “Let me think how to do this.”

---

Friday dawned hot and bright. The crew moved slower in the heat, bantering in lazy arcs. Bossman Ray was pacing with his clipboard, proud of the new site he’d just acquired across town. Calvin listened, a plan beginning to sketch itself.

When the BMW rolled in right on time, the trap sprung itself. ""Bossman Ray!” Calvin called. “You’ve gotta show Mr. Abrams our new facility — top-of-the-line wax arches. Come on, he’ll drive you over.” Flattered, the driver followed him out back.

“Now or never,” Marcus hissed.

Calvin hesitated, then tossed him the keys. “One lap. Nothing stupid.”

Marcus slid behind the wheel, hands trembling as he adjusted the seat. Calvin climbed in beside him, heart thudding with an old, illicit thrill. The leather smelled expensive and faintly chemical. Marcus turned the key. The engine purred, nothing magical about it at all.

They eased onto the county road. Wind whipped in through the open window. For a moment Marcus was grinning, the fantasy intact. Then the trim above the glovebox rattled over a seam in the asphalt.

“You hear that?” Calvin said. “That’s a \$600 rattle. German engineering or not, it’s still just a car.”

A patrol car appeared in the rearview mirror and both of them held their breath until it turned off at the next light. Marcus exhaled a shaky laugh. “Okay,” he said. “Okay, I’ve seen enough.”

They rolled back into the wash bay just as Ray and Mr. Abrams reappeared, still talking about wax packages. Marcus slipped out of the driver’s seat, wiping invisible fingerprints from the wheel. Nobody noticed.

Calvin handed him a rag. “Now help me dry off this Civic.”

Marcus took it, eyes a little different now — less star-struck, more grounded. The silver BMW idled for a moment before gliding away, no more mythical than any other car on the lot.

Above them the flags snapped in the breeze, sun-bleached but still holding on.

Baby should be fine after a little bump!” And yet here I am 🥲 I picked my 5.5 month old (3.5 corrected) baby up and bumped her little head on the corner of the coffee table, she was already crying because she got bored of playing under her play arch thing and I took a little too long to pick her up because I was loading the dishwasher and my partner was showering 😭 but the bump made her cry more and it broke my heart, and I felt like the worst mum ever!

The logical part of my brain is saying she’s fine, she calmed down really quickly, she had her bath and a good feed afterwards and is now cuddled up in my arms falling asleep because it’s her bed time. But the very loud anxious part of my brain is telling me I’ve hurt her and what if the sleepiness is actually because of the bump!? Again, it’s her usual bedtime, she always is sleepy around 7:30pm and goes to bed at 8pm, it’s currently 7:45pm so like… can someone just tell me to stop being a dummy and relax 😂

1nhhb5j,https://www.reddit.com/r/AI_Agents/comments/1nhhb5j/recommended_agent_tool_stack_for_smallbusiness/,Recommended agent / tool stack for small-business process automation & productivity support,"Hello, I am looking for insights on what AI agent and tool selections would make the most sense for automating a few routine business processes for my small business (coffee roastery). The rapid pace of change and new agents/tools coming out every other week makes it tough to decide what to use for my scenarios so any guidance would be appreciated. 

Scenarios: 

1. Order taking via chat: Take customer orders through chat via Whatsapp, Instagram with training on the product catalog and going through the standardized order process (customer name, address, pin/map location, product name, product quantity, etc). 
   * After taking the order, assign order ID, send a notification to internal whatsapp group with order confirmation
2. Generate quickbooks invoices on request through Whatsapp chat (e.g. ""@agent create a new invoice for customer X for order #2343), agent generates the quickbooks invoice, downloads the PDF and sends it into a whatsapp group
3. Customer follow-ups on whatsapp: request feedback after x days from order, send invoice due date follow-up messages automatically, mark payments as received in quickbooks, send order shipping confirmations
4. Generate PDF proforma invoices through whatsapp command using a pre-defined template
5. Log on-screen data points from production process control software (running on windows desktop computer) at the end of each production cycle into an Excel / Google sheet. 

  
Tech stack questions: 

* I have 2 always-on desktop computers which I intend to use as the server running my agent and tool stack. Would that make sense or should I consider having a VM where I deploy my stack?
* I would have whatsapp, instagram running and logged in on the desktop computer on a browser / native app, with the goal of the AI agent monitoring and responding to triggers and messages coming in. 
* Which AI agent is the most suitable for the above use cases which can remain in an ""always active"" state that responds autonomously, and can accept and retain the training to complete the above processes without needing re-prompting? What tier plan do I need to consider to enable these capabilities (if these capabilities exist)?
* Where and how should I consider using integration platforms like Zapier or n8n and does it make sense for my uses cases? Or can everything be managed by a single AI agent (e.g. on a premium plan)?

1nhhakd,https://www.reddit.com/r/bumbleIndia/comments/1nhhakd/beware_of_these_bumble_tinder_scams/,Beware of these bumble tinder scams,"I recently went on a date (I’m 22M). She asked me to join her for drinks. I made it clear I don’t drink—I’m a teetotaller—but she insisted I just come along to keep her company. Dumb me agreed.

We ended up at a club, and honestly, I hated the ambience and the crowd. She was a college student living with her sister and brother-in-law (I had no clue about the typical “scam” setups until later). Long story short—she drank, I didn’t, and I somehow ended up paying 14k… for basically a sip of water.

Lesson learned: if you’re ever going on a date, avoid clubs—stick to a coffee shop or somewhere cute and comfortable. I don’t even know why I went in the first place. I don’t drink, so it made zero sense.

Have you ever wondered, *does fasting help lose weight*? It's a question that's been buzzing around in health chats and online groups lately, and honestly, it's one I've pondered myself. I'm no expert, but from what I've read and tried, fasting can be a game-changer for shedding pounds—if you do it right. Today, I want to chat about this in a real, down-to-earth way, sharing what I've learned and why it might just inspire you to give it a shot. Stick around, because we're diving into the nitty-gritty, and I'll keep things light, motivational, and focused on you.

# What Exactly is Fasting and How Does It Work?

Fasting isn't some fancy fad; it's basically giving your body a break from eating. Think of it as hitting the reset button on your metabolism. There are different types, like intermittent fasting, where you eat during a set window and fast for the rest, or longer fasts that last a day or more. The big idea behind *does fasting help lose weight* is that when you fast, your body taps into stored fat for energy instead of relying on food. It's like your body's way of saying, ""Hey, I've got reserves—let's use them!""

From my chats with buddies who've tried it, fasting can kickstart weight loss by reducing calorie intake naturally. Studies I've come across suggest it might lower insulin levels, which helps with fat burning. But remember, it's not a magic bullet; it's about creating a sustainable habit. If you're curious, many in online communities share how incorporating fasting into their routine has led to noticeable changes. The key is to start small—maybe skip a meal and see how you feel. It's empowering to think that something as simple as controlling when you eat could play a role in your health journey.

# The Science Behind Fasting and Weight Loss

Okay, let's get a bit deeper—does fasting help lose weight for real? Based on what I've dug into, yes, it often does, but it's not just about the scale. When you fast, your body enters a state called ketosis, where it burns fat for fuel. This can lead to weight loss, especially if you're consistent. I remember reading about how fasting might boost metabolism and reduce inflammation, making it easier to shed those extra pounds over time.

What's cool is that fasting isn't one-size-fits-all. For some, like me when I tried it, it helped curb cravings and made me more mindful of what I eat. Imagine feeling more in control of your body—it's a pretty inspiring thought, right? Of course, results vary; factors like age, activity level, and overall health matter. But hearing stories from groups online about people dropping weight without extreme diets? That's motivating. If you're thinking about trying it, focus on the positives: better energy, clearer focus, and that sense of accomplishment when you see progress.

# Real Talk: My Journey and What I've Learned

Let me share a bit personally—I've experimented with fasting, and wow, it made me ask myself, *does fasting help lose weight* in my case? Spoiler: It did! I started with a simple 16-hour fast, like skipping breakfast, and over a few weeks, I noticed the pounds melting away. It wasn't overnight, but the gradual changes kept me hooked. The best part? I felt more energized and less bloated, which was a huge win for my daily routine.

But here's the thing—it's not always easy. There were days when hunger hit hard, and I had to remind myself why I started. That's where community support comes in; chatting with friends or folks in online groups about their experiences kept me going. They shared tips like staying hydrated and choosing nutrient-rich foods when breaking the fast. It's all about building resilience and celebrating small victories. If you're on the fence, know that fasting can be a tool for empowerment, helping you reclaim control over your health in a natural way.

# Tips for Safely Incorporating Fasting into Your Routine

If you're intrigued by *does fasting help lose weight*, here are some practical tips to get you started. Remember, this is about making it work for you, not forcing it. Let's break it down:

* **Start slow:** Begin with a 12-14 hour overnight fast. For example, eat dinner by 7 PM and don't eat until 9 AM. This gives your body time to adjust without overwhelming you.
* **Stay hydrated:** Drink plenty of water, herbal teas, or even black coffee during your fast. It keeps you feeling full and supports your body's processes.
* **Listen to your body:** If you feel dizzy or weak, don't push it. Fasting works best when it's sustainable, so eat a balanced meal to break your fast if needed.
* **Combine with healthy habits:** Pair fasting with regular walks, good sleep, and stress management. It's not just about skipping meals—it's about a holistic approach.
* **Track your progress:** Keep a journal of how you feel and any weight changes. This can be super motivating and help you tweak things as you go.

Incorporating these steps has made a difference for me and many others I've talked to. It's about creating a routine that feels good, not restrictive.

# Wrapping It Up: Is Fasting the Right Move for You?

So, to circle back, *does fasting help lose weight*? From what we've covered, it sure can, especially when done thoughtfully. It's not just a trend; it's a way to reconnect with your body and build lasting habits. I've shared my thoughts to inspire you, not to push an agenda—think of it as a friendly nudge toward exploring what works for you.

Here that is!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- `1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
____________
Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
_________________________
Source(s):
every `1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nhh38s,https://waxonwattoff.com/proton-emas-7-review-6-months-malaysia/?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=emas7review,My review of the Proton eMAS 7 (Geely EX5 Malaysian Rebadge) after 6 months of ownership,"**TLDR:** Quiet, spacious, and cheap to run at home electricity rates. Soft ride suits city roads, but safety warnings get loud, some settings do not save, and Android Auto is still missing. DC peaks near 120 kW, so plan coffee-length stops.

I've driven the Proton eMAS 7 (Premium in Lithium White) for six months in Malaysia, so here is my review. I cover 250 to 300 km a week (mileage currently at 5,671 km), about 75% city and 25% highway driving, with the AC set to 24°C on Auto. This use case frames the numbers below.

# Why I chose it

I moved to the eMAS 7 for space, low running costs, and a calm daily drive. Rear room is generous, which helps with child seats, and the front seats keep good support on long days. The car settles into city life without fuss. Visibility is clear, the steering is light at low speed, and the cabin stays quiet at 110 km/h with only a hint of wind around the mirrors. The ride sits on the soft side, which smooths broken streets. Over long waves the body can bounce before it settles, so I take that in mind when going over bumps.

# Range and efficiency, measured on my routes

My lifetime average holds at **14 kWh per 100 km**. In the city I see about **320 km** from 100 to 10 percent. On the highway at **90 to 110 km/h** my trips land around **340 km**. I keep tyre pressures on spec and drive with light inputs. A best city loop of 30 km in slow traffic returned **12 kWh per 100 km** in dry weather. Heavy rain has been rare in my period, so I cannot give a strong wet-weather penalty yet.

# Charging routine and time on the plug

Home charging does most of the work. I use the Proton 7 kW wallbox at **RM0.45 per kWh**, and I average about six hours of AC charging a week. At my lifetime consumption, a 100 km home day costs **RM6.30**. For road trips I use Gentari and JomCharge. On a warm battery the car peaks near **120 kW** and tapers cleanly. A **10 to 80 percent** stop takes about **30 minutes**, which fits a bathroom break and a drink. At **RM1.60 per kWh**, DC works out to about **RM22.40 per 100 km**. Payments have been smooth, and queues are uncommon on my routes when I avoid peak windows.

# What it costs me to run

I drive about **1,000 km a month**. My home bill share is roughly **RM75 per month** at current usage. I use public DC once every two months for about **40 kWh** each time, so about **RM192** over six months. Add both, and my six-month energy spend sits in the **RM570 to RM642** range depending on the home versus DC mix. Insurance cost me about **RM4,000** with no NCD and there is **no EV road tax** yet.

# Tech, software, and the bits that still need polish

The HUD is a daily win and the main screen responds without lag. I am still waiting for Android Auto on my unit as of September 2025. The car also forgets some drive and safety preferences, so I reselect Auto regen and turn off alerts more often than I would like. Safety aids help on clean highways. ICC holds a steady gap and lane keep works when markings are clear. In dense city traffic with many motorcycles I take charge, since the system can lift or brake earlier than a human would. Safety chimes sound louder than needed and some cannot be switched off, so deeper control here would help.

# Reliability, service, and small misses

No faults to report, no parts wait, and no forced resets so far. The cabin stays rattle-free. I do wish it had a frunk for cable storage, since a small sealed bin would keep wet gear away from groceries and strollers. DC charging that peaks near 120 kW trails newer rivals, but it still fits a coffee-length stop.

# Who this suits

If you want space, comfort, and low daily cost with home charging, the eMAS 7 fits well. If you need the shortest DC stops or a firm, sporty ride, you may lean to something else. My wish list is simple, Android Auto, deeper settings memory tied to a profile, quieter or configurable alerts, and a small front storage bin. Even without those, the car keeps its promises on my roads.

Here is that!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- `1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

1nhgznn,https://waxonwattoff.com/proton-emas-7-review-6-months-malaysia/?utm_source=reddit.com&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=emas7review,My review of the Proton eMAS 7 after 6 months of ownership,"**TLDR:** Quiet, spacious, and cheap to run at home electricity rates. Soft ride suits city roads, but safety warnings get loud, some settings do not save, and Android Auto is still missing. DC peaks near 120 kW, so plan coffee-length stops.

  
I've driven the Proton eMAS 7 (Premium in Lithium White) for six months in Malaysia, so here is my review. I cover 250 to 300 km a week (mileage currently at 5,671 km), about 75% city and 25% highway driving, with the AC set to 24°C on Auto. This use case frames the numbers below.

# Why I chose it

I moved to the eMAS 7 for space, low running costs, and a calm daily drive. Rear room is generous, which helps with child seats, and the front seats keep good support on long days. The car settles into city life without fuss. Visibility is clear, the steering is light at low speed, and the cabin stays quiet at 110 km/h with only a hint of wind around the mirrors. The ride sits on the soft side, which smooths broken streets. Over long waves the body can bounce before it settles, so I take that in mind when going over bumps.

# Range and efficiency, measured on my routes

My lifetime average holds at **14 kWh per 100 km**. In the city I see about **320 km** from 100 to 10 percent. On the highway at **90 to 110 km/h** my trips land around **340 km**.

A **10 to 80 percent** stop takes about **30 minutes**, which fits a bathroom break and a drink. At **RM1.60 per kWh**, DC works out to about **RM22.40 per 100 km**. Payments have been smooth, and queues are uncommon on my routes when I avoid peak windows.

# What it costs me to run

I drive about **1,000 km a month**. My home bill share is roughly **RM75 per month** at current usage. I use public DC once every two months for about **40 kWh** each time, so about **RM192** over six months. Add both, and my six-month energy spend sits in the **RM570 to RM642** range depending on the home versus DC mix. Insurance cost me about **RM4,000** with no NCD and there is **no EV road tax** yet.

To start with: I am a person who overthinks, has a generalized anxiety disorder, becomes hypochondriacal, and is currently on the right track with an eating disorder.

Since the onset of my current UTI, I have been experiencing recurring minor panic attacks related to this issue, particularly concerning the future.

My fears relate to:

- Antibiotic resistance

- Diet:
After my first UTI, I quickly returned to my usual eating habits. Coffee every day, something sweet every day, such as cake, cookies, or chocolate. Giving up coffee shouldn't be difficult for me.
However, my head tells me that I can't eat cake, etc. anymore (never again) to avoid a UTI. This, in turn, is incredibly difficult for my eating disorder and triggers anxiety.
How do you manage your diet? 

- What/how/where/why regarding preventive measures in general:
There are many things one could do (I ordered cranberry capsules lol) and I feel overwhelmed and unsure about what is right and how to do it.

- Mental health in general:
How do you deal with it?

(I also suffer from migraines and am very familiar with the suffering caused by chronic problems, but I still find it difficult to deal with them...)  

Info:
First UTI, end of June (cleared with antibiotics, trimethoprim + sulfamethoxazole)
Second UTI (fosfomycin 2 doses), last week, after previously taking antibiotics (augmentin) at the end of August for wisdom teeth.

No urine sample was taken by my doctor..
I found out at home using urine test strips that Leu and Nit were positive.

Next steps?

So I (26F, call me Melissa) have been with my partner “Garth” for years. We’re not married but we live together and raise 4 kids (one together, one his, two mine). At the start I really tried with his mom Debbie. I’d suggest coffee, dinners, even helped with her little business. I actually wanted us to be close.

But honestly things got messy. Like, my stepdaughter Cindy was really sick with the flu at one point, she was struggling to breathe at night, so we said no dairy because it makes it worse. Debbie gave her milk behind my back anyway. I called her out and she just cried and turned it into “oh I think I caused Garth’s diabetes” 🙄. She does this all the time, the crying to avoid being wrong. I snapped and told her if she didn’t stop crying I’d throw my tea on her (not my proudest moment, but it worked).

She’s also a hoarder to the point that her house, her late parents’ house, and even our garages and porch got filled with her stuff. When we asked her to move it, she cried about how we were “pressuring her.”

She criticizes Garth constantly too. Like he used reward points to get some Pokémon cards and was happy about it. She told him he should’ve used it for a weed eater. I defended him and she stormed outside, hid in my garden for an hour, my kids Declan and Dylan were freaking out looking for her, and Garth’s 90yo grandpa just sat awkwardly on the couch.

She also makes digs like “you’re just not the same when you’re with these people” (meaning me and the kids). And in her eyes, every single problem between her and Garth or her and the kids is somehow my fault.

So now when she comes over, I just keep it polite but short. Pleasantries, maybe on my phone, but I don’t start conversations. She’s judgmental and a know-it-all so I just keep my distance.

Anyway, the other day she’s at my house, leaving, and she says to Garth (loud enough for me to hear): “Any woman would be lucky to have you. That Melissa, she’s just always so ugly to me. I got along with my ex DIL way better, she apologized when we fought. Melissa never will.”

Later she messaged me saying I’m silent, disrespectful, that she feels unwelcome, and even basically said “if you don’t want me in Garth’s life then so be it.”

I told her we could have coffee and talk it through sometime but not that night because I had the kids and a headache.

At this point, I don’t want Cindy sleeping over there anymore. If Debbie wants to see the kids, she can come here, but she has to actually be pleasant. I don’t want her negativity or whatever pill stuff she has going on in my house.

So, AITA for setting these rules and pulling back instead of just “playing nice”?

We achieved this by setting the grinder to 1 and also the internal one to minimum. This means - the finest possible. However, it feels now that the coffee, for some strange reason, lost all acidity and flavor depth. Surprisingly, It tastes less acidic than when grinder was set on 3. Coffee is Indian Arabica, AA grade, single origin, roasted about 6 weeks ago. 

I am happy to take any constructive criticism, bring it on. 

I would be happy to hear your experiences and best practices with the Barista Express.

But I do like to have a different scenery from time to time. Hard to stay focused at the home office so I tend to go to remote-friendly workspaces nearby with my laptop and be surrounded by others who work there as well. And I get to drink good coffee ☕️

Zeroharm Sciences created Carb Cutter for people who struggle to cut carbs but still want better control over their weight.

The supplement is made with plant-based ingredients like white kidney bean and green coffee bean. These extracts help slow down the conversion of carbs into fat, which means you can still enjoy your favorite foods while reducing the calorie impact.

According to reviews, many users feel less bloated after heavy meals and notice improved energy levels. Since it’s made from natural ingredients, no major side effects have been reported. Still, consulting a doctor before starting any supplement is always a smart choice.

Carb Cutter isn’t a magic pill, but when combined with a balanced diet and regular activity, it can be a strong support for weight management.

1nhgpip,https://www.reddit.com/r/nosurf/comments/1nhgpip/the_two_phone_solution/,The Two Phone Solution,"Just wanted to pop in here and give a bit of advice or offer a hack for anyone looking to create better boundaries around the internet.

I have been using two phones for awhile now to help combat the time wasting scrolling I have fallen into.

My routine has been to wake up, have coffee, scroll for 60 mins then head to work where I run a big e-commerce business in a warehouse 45 mins away. While I’m there I literally NEVER scroll, I’m working! 

Coming home, I feed cats/myself, catch up with family, do house stuff. Then scrolllllllllllllllll. Sometimes I’ll engage in a hobby but the scroll monster is ALWAYS there.

I’ve recently lose a loved one and I’m completely over “time wasting, dopamine chasing” nonsense. Also, I’m getting really sick of internet trolls and their shitty comments. I feel like I need to protect myself from them while in my safe space (home).

My main scroll traps: Tik Tok, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Reddit. I also create content for my business so I feel I HAVE to scroll in order to get a sense of the trends. 

So I’ve solved this by buying a duplicate phone on eBay. 

Phone #1 - My primary phone. It has a phone number, critical/non toxic apps. Stuff I won’t get stuck on. The rest are blocked permanently by the freedom.to app so I can’t even click on a link and open them. I also deactivated my personal social media accounts as I am not really interested in the toxicity there.

Phone #2 - Stays at the warehouse. It doesn’t have a data plan, so has to use Internet. My boundaries are: once my employees go home, once a week, I will batch create my content, set them to post, then forget about it. I allow myself to scroll only to look at trends and get ideas. Since staying late at a warehouse isn’t fun at all, I get this done quickly so I can go home.

The basic rule is: no home scrolling!

I’m loving it! I’ve been composing more music, writing, reading, chatting with family, exercising, doing house projects, etc. it’s like how life used to be before our attention spans were abducted.

I’m about 120% happier overall on a day to day basis. Life feels manageable. Sometimes it’s a bit annoying when I can’t look up something cause it’s on a social media article, but I just send a message to my other phone to remind myself to look at it or ask my husband to look it up.

The cost was about $350 (freedom app and iPhone). 

Give it a try if you think it will help! I understand ya’ll can’t always leave a phone at work, but they also sell lock boxes with timers. Or you can keep your scroll phone in a storage locker/friends house.

1nhgo7l,https://www.reddit.com/r/LostMediaBrasil/comments/1nhgo7l/whats_purpose_of_life_here_is_that/,What's purpose of life? Here is that!,"Practical Explanation ( For Example ) :- `1st of all can you tell me every single seconds detail from that time when you born ?? ( i need every seconds detail ?? that what- what you have thought and done on every single second )

can you tell me every single detail of your `1 cheapest Minute Or your whole hour, day, week, month, year or your whole life ??

if you are not able to tell me about this life then what proof do you have that you didn't forget your past ? and that you will not forget this present life in the future ?

that is Fact that Supreme Lord Krishna exists but we posses no such intelligence to understand him.
there is also next life. and i already proved you that no scientist, no politician, no so-called intelligent man in this world is able to understand this Truth. cuz they are imagining. and you cannot imagine what is god, who is god, what is after life etc.
_______
for example :Your father existed before your birth. you cannot say that before your birth your father don,t exists.

So you have to ask from mother, ""Who is my father?"" And if she says, ""This gentleman is your father,"" then it is all right. It is easy.
Otherwise, if you makes research, ""Who is my father?"" go on searching for life; you'll never find your father.

( now maybe...maybe you will say that i will search my father from D.N.A, or i will prove it by photo's, or many other thing's which i will get from my mother and prove it that who is my Real father.{ So you have to believe the authority. who is that authority ? she is your mother. you cannot claim of any photo's, D.N.A or many other things without authority ( or ur mother ).

if you will show D.N.A, photo's, and many other proofs from other women then your mother. then what is use of those proofs ??} )

same you have to follow real authority. ""Whatever You have spoken, I accept it,"" Then there is no difficulty. And You are accepted by Devala, Narada, Vyasa, and You are speaking Yourself, and later on, all the acaryas have accepted. Then I'll follow.
I'll have to follow great personalities. The same reason mother says, this gentleman is my father. That's all. Finish business. Where is the necessity of making research? All authorities accept Krsna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. You accept it; then your searching after God is finished.

Why should you waste your time?
_______
all that is you need is to hear from authority ( same like mother ). and i heard this truth from authority "" Srila Prabhupada "" he is my spiritual master.
im not talking these all things from my own.
___________

in this world no `1 can be Peace full. this is all along Fact.

cuz we all are suffering in this world 4 Problems which are Disease, Old age, Death, and Birth after Birth.

tell me are you really happy ?? you can,t be happy if you will ignore these 4 main problem. then still you will be Forced by Nature.
___________________

if you really want to be happy then follow these 6 Things which are No illicit s.ex, No g.ambling, No d.rugs ( No tea & coffee ), No meat-eating ( No onion & garlic's )

5th thing is whatever you eat `1st offer it to Supreme Lord Krishna. ( if you know it what is Guru parama-para then offer them food not direct Supreme Lord Krishna )

and 6th "" Main Thing "" is you have to Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "".
_______________________________
If your not able to follow these 4 things no illicit s.ex, no g.ambling, no d.rugs, no meat-eating then don,t worry but chanting of this holy name ( Hare Krishna Maha-Mantra ) is very-very and very important.

Chant "" hare krishna hare krishna krishna krishna hare hare hare rama hare rama rama rama hare hare "" and be happy.

if you still don,t believe on me then chant any other name for 5 Min's and chant this holy name for 5 Min's and you will see effect. i promise you it works And chanting at least 16 rounds ( each round of 108 beads ) of the Hare Krishna maha-mantra daily.
____________
Here is no Question of Holy Books quotes, Personal Experiences, Faith or Belief. i accept that Sometimes Faith is also Blind. Here is already Practical explanation which already proved that every`1 else in this world is nothing more then Busy Foolish and totally idiot.
_________________________
Source(s):
every `1 is already Blind in this world and if you will follow another Blind then you both will fall in hole. so try to follow that person who have Spiritual Eyes who can Guide you on Actual Right Path. ( my Authority & Guide is my Spiritual Master "" Srila Prabhupada "" )

1nhgn6j,https://v.redd.it/t5e1ubfslapf1,Horizon Glide - Infinite isometric arcade shooter finally out!,"\[repost since yesterday's post didn't upload the video correctly\]  
  
Hey r/pico8! Horizon Glide is finally released and playable at [https://bonnie-games.itch.io/](https://bonnie-games.itch.io/)

I posted about this game's development a [couple times](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/1mxyjx5/update_horizon_glide_implemented_your_feedback/). You all gave such amazing feedback and I was planning to implement more of it, but I'll be honest I got completely distracted building [my own PICO-8 style engine in Love2D](https://www.reddit.com/r/pico8/comments/1n4vkfv/making_a_pico8_style_engine_in_love2d/) which I also hope to release soon. Between that and my full-time job, I decided to release Horizon Glide as-is rather than let it sit forever!

**The game:**  
An infinite isometric arcade shooter where you pilot a hover-ship through procedurally generated landscapes. Every run is unique with dynamic terrain ranging from water to mountain peaks, and enemy AI ships to battle.

**Controls are simple:**

* Arrow keys to move
* X to shoot

I squeezed this into a single PICO-8 cart (wanted it on SPLORE) which meant some serious token optimization. I've got about 100 tokens left, so future updates will be... creative.

Once my Love2D engine is ready, I'm planning to port Horizon Glide and my first game Cortex Override over and add all those features I had to cut due to token limits.

Would love to hear what you think if you give it a try. And if you're interested, my first game Cortex Override is also available for free. Like my first game, the source code is on GitHub: [https://github.com/EBonura/HorizonGlide](https://github.com/EBonura/HorizonGlide)

Thanks again for being such a supportive community through this journey!

1. DIY my own setup.
2. Spend a bit more and get a bigger brand-name unit that can cover more use cases.

I promise - it’s not like that. Even though it could’ve been a fun little plot twist. I also have to apologize on behalf of personality 37, she has a tendency to get swallowed into the magic of poetic dreamyness. The day my very own “Mr. Big” came into my life wasn’t really that big of a deal. Yes, it was cool to meet this lovely guy - and his best friend (who I thought was his boyfriend), who had traveled all the way from across the world. They were just casually vacationing in my home town, and coincidently walking into the gym at the same time me and my friends were there. Even though the conversation was short, we made a surprising amount of plans together. So it felt completely reasonable to swap numbers with these two strangers we met 10 minutes ago. We agreed to travel to the other side of the world next summer to visit them, and they would come back in a couple of months. To be real, it didn’t feel more than those moments when you meet an acquaintance on the street and throw out the mandatory ""let's get a coffee sometime"". They left, and that was it. We were definitely never meeting them again. As the days slipped past, the uneventful meet slowly faded into the abyss - but like a bad cologne, there was still a lingering memory about his eyes that never really went away. 

Days, weeks, months went by - and guess who came back. He actually meant it when he said he would come back.  Just imagine - how do you even react to that? Is it giving romance, or is it giving psychopath? But there he was. Just an innocent man unaware of his part of some  cosmic-level nonsense. We all went out together, and circumstances only allowed this to be a one time event. During the night, we sat next to each other and started talking. I told him about my life, my boyfriend and about our plans to take the next step. I wasn't sure who I was trying to convince - him or myself. But he was not buying it.  His eyes were just piercing through the bullshit that even I wasn't aware of. I felt naked. He saw me, behind the mask I didn't know I was wearing. He asked questions and challenged my thoughts in a way nobody had ever done before. You get the picture, you've heard these stories before. I'll say it as it is, it was fucking magnetic. After this night, the silence and the peace I had felt the past few months was gone. As I was walking home I could feel some type of force entering my body, everything I thought I knew was crumbling, the lies I had kept telling myself were surfacing, the silenced voices in my head were now louder than ever, and the fog that had felt like a veil of safety was gone - everything became clear. And when I realized what I had to do next…gosh. Remember that scene from Twilight when Edward saw Bella walking into the classroom? And you can’t quite tell if  he’s reacting to inhaling a moth or experiencing acute diarrhea? …felt like something like that.  


The thing is - there are so many details, feelings, chaos and magic in this epic love story that definitely can trigger your gag reflex. As I am writing this, I have to keep reminding myself that this part isn’t really the point. It was never the point. So I have to keep it short, and fast forward a year - I broke up with my boyfriend, sold the house, the car, left my job - and moved across the world to be with this man. This left many people confused, and it’s safe to say that my family were probably regretting their choices of not having me tested as a kid. As for me and my Mr. Big - we were just happily unaware of our path into the most intense, divine shitstorm that was about to rip our souls into galactic stardust. While we were too busy falling in love - the universe was sharpening its teeth, and our guides preparing the snacks for this cosmic apocalypse. Here we go.

I did a tape test after hours. painter’s tape on the floor for the line, arrows for in and out, a couple of chairs as fake bottlenecks. then I asked two friends to play “rush” while I pulled shots. it was very revealing where people naturally drifted.

I tried paper and quick spreadsheets to move things around. Later I threw it together using xdesign to quick online layout.I mapped out the customer path and it highlighted some choke points I wasn’t seeing in my head, so I nudged things and tried again.

small tweaks made a big difference. a sign at the door that says order here, pickup there. the pastry case two steps before the POS instead of after. a narrow table moved so baristas are not shoulder to shoulder.

Curious what others did before opening or during a redo. Any cheap tricks for guiding the line without buying stanchions? How decide where the pickup shelf lives so it does not block the door?",3,1757925935.0,DIY,7,0.67,False

I only drink cappuccino, but the capsules I bought are mostly espresso-type. Only a small portion of them are lungo-type. When I tried a capsule in my friend's home, he made me a lungo and then added milk, so I am afraid 40 ml extraction -regular espresso size- might not be enough for a cup of cappuccino.  
  
Should I change all my espresso capsules with the lungo ones, or can I just use an espresso-type capsule and choose lungo while making the coffee to extract it more, without making it watery?

Now I’m regretting it.,"Last weekend my partner and I split up and I’m not sure if I’m the problem or not. I don’t have a lot of friends and I don’t like brining other people into my problems but my heads spinning and I need some help. 
Bit of context,
On Saturday my partner went to Pilates and coffee with her mum. While she was out I decided I’d get a head start on
Chores and mow the lawns and tidy up outside. 
On her way home she had called and asked if I wanted to take the dogs for a walk and I replied I don’t really feel like it, I’m still mowing the lawn and sweating up a storm. She got home while I was still mowing and decided she would wash the dogs. 
We were both hanging out the back with the dogs throwing the ball and all seemed good.
I then got a text message from my of my best mates who I don’t really get a chance to see anymore as he has a newborn asking if I wanted to go for a beer down the pub. I thought that would be a good way to spend the afternoon as I had done what needed to be done around the house and asked her if it would be okay if I did that. She said yes that’s fine. 
So I went and had a shower and drove to the pub. Once I arrived I got a text off her saying “do you care if I stay at Jess house tonight?” 
I said “no not at all are you okay?”
She replied with “I just wanted to do something this afternoon and jess is keen so it’s all good, you just do your thing and I’ll do mine”. 
I replied with “okay have fun”.

All good so I thought we had no other communication that night. 

I come home around 4pm made some dinner and watched Netflix for the rest of the night until bed. 
The next day I send her a message saying “good morning x”  at around 6:30 am 
She ignores it until around 9 am no big deal. 
She calls me telling me how disappointing she is and that I’m not giving her enough and that I would rather hang out with my mates then see her or spend any quality time with her. 
I tried to explain that I hadn’t seen any mates for the past 2 months and I had spent the last 4 weeks with her and her family doing family oriented activities. 
Nothing I said was good enough for her. 
She told me she cannot do this anymore and that she was moving out. 
She come by around 1pm with her friend and packed her stuff and moved out. 
I’m sitting here wondering what the hell has happened, where did I go wrong ? 
I work hard, (50-60 hours a weeks), cook every night for us pitch in around the house. 
I’m drained. I just wanted a few hours to myself and it feels like i have lost everything because of it. 
If I could turn time back I would. I would go on the walk. I didn’t realise this would be the consequence.
I apologised to her for making her feel that way. I don’t know what else I could had done differently.

1nhgak5,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskWomenOver30/comments/1nhgak5/feeling_guilty_have_i_asked_for_too_much/,Feeling guilty - have I asked for too much?!,"Hi, 

We’ve been having arguments for a while with my husband of 6 years. 

Everything has heightened since I’ve returned back to work from being on Maternity leave. I am expected to do the same exact things I was doing which was pretty much everything and still work. Now he does unload the dishwasher and put the laundry to wash and in the dryer and vacuums. But those things in my eyes don’t take a long time. Recently he’s been off work because of a back issue, he takes medication for it most of the day he’s laying watching tv. However out of 8 hour day Im expecting a little more like maybe he could iron a few bits or he could clean round the sink or order some school pants for his son. You know all the little bits since I’m at work. To him he’s going over and beyond. According to him I’m trying to make him my b*tch. All I want is mutual respect, he said I’ve got a crappy job and I don’t take care of my kids, I don’t do anything, amongst talking bad about my family, the night before last he just shouted for about an hour, belitttling me to feel like I’m useless and I’m a shit mother. 

When on maternity leave I had a a 3 year old and the baby and everyone morning would take him a coffee up to him, would make lunch and dinner whilst looking after the boys. Only time I would ask him for help was when I needed to go to the toilet. Or on his lunch I’d say can you look after the boys whilst I finish lunch. To him - looking after his boys at lunch is a favour to me.

He’s said I’ll divorce you plenty of times or I’ll take you back to your dad’s house. The last time he said this was about 3 weeks ago and then the following week he starts being flirty and asking for sex. Which had me really confused. And now we’ve had another argument and he text my dad about it. 

I just feel so shit, like am I asking for too much?! This is obviously amongst other things but I just gave some examples above. I feel guilty, I feel ashamed and maybe I am all the things he said I am.  He wants me to be like wow you have vacuumed thank you, but no one thanks me for doing anything.  In the argument he said i wanted kids so I have them now and to stop complaining, the things I do are part of being a mother. I feel like he wants to hold this patriarchal role, man of the house, but I organise everything, I do everything house admin, car school etc. those masculine roles of man works woman stays at home and does everything but I still go to work. Where a woman should bend over backwards. He wants me to be like that appreciative of having a house, kids, a husband in his words I should be grateful. But he wants me to be like a stay at home mum but also hold all the mental load of every single bit of life?! 

I’ve been crying so much, feeling like absolute shit, having some crazy thoughts. I’ve failed, I’ve ruined my boys family set up. We can’t discuss anything as he just shouts and over rides anything I have to say. I’ve asked for marriage counselling but he ignored my request. Ultimately I am scared for the future, I feel guilty. 

Just some more context, since I’ve been with him he’s never bought him self a pair of boxers. I’ve bought everything for him. 

Sorry more of a vent and needing to put something down somewhere. Obvs these are just a few things and it doesn’t highlight everything. ",2,1757925018.0,AskWomenOver30,14,0.63,False

Not a makeup user myself (I leave that to my wife!), but she’s been into high-end beauty for years, and lately, one product has completely taken over her routine: **Chantecaille Lip Chic in Wild Rose**.

She got it on Amazon after seeing rave reviews, and honestly? The hype is real.

💄 A few things she loves about it:

* **Color:** It’s a gorgeous warm coral-pink with a subtle cranberry undertone — super flattering on her medium skin tone. Looks amazing with minimal makeup.
* **Finish:** Matte, but not drying. She says it feels lightweight and doesn’t settle into fine lines.
* **Application:** The bullet has a unique shape that follows the lip line perfectly. She rarely needs a lip liner.
* **Longevity:** Lasts through coffee and light meals. She usually reappplies after eating, but that’s normal for most matte formulas.
* **Packaging:** Feels luxurious — metallic tube, magnetic closure. She says it looks expensive in her bag.

It’s definitely a splurge at **$64.46**, but she says the formula and pigment are unlike anything else she’s used — even compared to other luxury brands like Tom Ford or YSL.

👉 If you’re curious, here’s the link where she got it:  
[Chantecaille Lip Chic – Wild Rose on Amazon](https://amzn.to/3K1yBgY)

She’s already getting compliments every time she wears it. Has anyone else here tried Chantecaille? Any dupes or similar shades you’d recommend?

Would love to hear your thoughts — I’m just the messenger, but I’ll make sure she sees your replies! 😊

How many times have you wished someone would tell you how beautiful you are? Or maybe you just want to start your day with a smile. If that thought resonates with you, the **Gentle Compliments** app might be exactly what you need.

This app is a little pocket companion that delivers kind words straight to your phone — either for yourself or for your loved one. Here’s how it works:

# 🌸 Why install it?

Because sometimes we all need a reminder. *Gentle Compliments* is built to brighten your day with tender words that remind you there’s nothing more important than **you**. Whether you’re enjoying your first morning coffee or winding down after a long day, those sweet reminders can make all the difference.

# ⚙️ How does it work?

When you install the app, you can choose between two main modes:

* **On Schedule** → Pick a time interval (e.g., every 24 hours) and receive compliments at those moments. Perfect for daily motivation.
* **Surprise Mode** → Get surprised with compliments at random times within a set period (e.g., every 6, 8, or 12 hours). You’ll never know exactly when — and that’s part of the charm.

# 💌 Why it’s also for men

Even though the app is tailored mostly for women, it works beautifully for their partners too. With the **“Send a compliment”** feature, you can:

* Forward the message to your girlfriend or wife
* Add your own personal twist before sending
* Use it for birthdays, anniversaries, or just because ❤️

# ✍️ Can you add your own?

Yes! Alongside the pre-made collection, you can:

* **Write and save your own compliments**
* **Delete the ones you don’t like**
* **Customize your compliment feed** so it feels truly personal

✨ Because sometimes you just need to hear how beautiful you are — and with *Gentle Compliments*, you’ll never have to wait too long.

Can someone help?,"Hello, if you are reading this it's because I'm completely lost here and I need your help to decide which one is my vulnerable function.

Being very forgetful and disorganized has caused a lot of problems in my life and because of that I am now the Lord of the Lists and Coping Mechanisms. If I go to the supermarket to buy two items there's a 70% chance I'll forget one if I don't have a list.

House cleaning? I make a step by step list even though I end up cleaning my house in a ""cleaning for the eyes of the mother in law"" sort of way like Tom from the cartoon who hides the dirt under the rug.  
If I leave my house for a vacation, I do a 7 day house clean up so that the neighbor who comes to feed my cats thinks we live in a house more sanitized than private clinics.

My biggest nightmare is going on a trip and forgetting my underwear at home, sounds silly but the struggle is real. It's a bit annoying because I can spit out random facts or remember what I was doing 20 years ago, but somehow I once forgot to put on a skirt before going outside.  

I wear clothes until they are so worn out that my SO tells me I look negligent. But many of my items are important to me, they have a story: like where I bought them, who I was with and events that happened while I was wearing them. I have these sandals I've taken for repair so many times I'm not even sure there's much left of the original sandal. They look like Frankenstein now but we have so much history I can't bring myself to throw them away.

I also have a mechanism not to lose things: when I take something from a place, I immediately put it back in the same spot. So I was very angry when my SO put the pepper in the salt place and vice versa because instead of making risotto al tonno I ended up making risotto al pepe.

✋️Don't get me started on my moka pot just don't touch it, ok?  
I wake up 30 minutes before my SO because I secretly believe I make better coffee and turn making coffee into an art ritual.  
If for some reason he ends up waking up earlier than me, I get up half-awake half-asleep and race him to the kitchen like it's a sacred duel of destiny.  
I have all kinds of coffee tools and I grind  the beans each morning at 6:45 AM with a manual grinder.  
I firmly refuse automatic espresso machines and prefer to torture myself each morning.  
I get very annoyed when people tell me, ""Yeah, but it's more efficient"" and I’ll go on this caffeinated manifesto because it's not about efficiency, it's about art, total control, mastery, effort, time wasted and personal signature.
