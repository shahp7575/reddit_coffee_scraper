Monday, October 27, 2025 6 PM. Umrath Lounge","On Monday, October 27th at 6:00 p.m., Jewish, Islamic, and Middle Eastern Studies (JIMES) at Washington University in St. Louis will host award-winning writer Ayelet Tsabari for a reading and discussion of her debut novel, *Songs for the Brokenhearted* (HarperCollins, 2024).

Tsabari will introduce her novel, which was the winner of the 2024 National Jewish Book. Building on the success of her memoir *The Art of Leaving* and her story collection *The Best Place on Earth*, Tsabari’s novel explores the experiences of Yemini immigrants in Israel from its founding through the backlash to the Oslo Peace Accords. These episodes in Israeli politics and culture continue to reverberate today.

Tsabari will also speak about growing up Yemeni in Israel, about re-finding and reclaiming that identity through writing and through extensive research into Yemeni culture and traditions. She will share audio and images from her research into the Yemeni women’s songs that are a leitmotiv in the novel, and speak of some of the unique challenges she has faced writing about Israel in English, her second language. This lecture will explore the many ways in which a writer’s cultural background, mother tongue, and origins influence and inform her writing, in terms of both content and style.

The event is free and open to the public and will be held in Umrath Lounge on the Danforth campus of Washington University in St. Louis. A reception will begin at 5:30 p.m., followed by the main program at 6:00 p.m.

There will also be an informal discussion with Tsabari the next morning (Tuesday, October 28) at 9 am as the latest in the occasional series of **Coffee and Conversation with Israeli Writers.** The event will be held in the Danforth University Center (the DUC) room 233.

**About the Book**: *Songs for the Brokenhearted* traces intertwined stories of love, loss, and discovery spanning two transformative moments in Israeli history. One storyline begins in the early years of Israeli statehood in the squalor of an immigrant camp, where a forbidden love unfolds between the young Yaqub and the married Saida. The second, set in the volatile summer of 1995, follows Zohara, a disillusioned graduate student in New York, who returns to Israel after her mother’s death and uncovers startling family secrets hidden in recordings of her mother’s singing. Tacking back and forth between the early years of Israeli statehood and the mid-1990s, the novel explores intergenerational memory, the legacies of migration and displacement, and the complex bonds between mothers and daughters.

Critics have hailed the book as “a gorgeous, gripping novel filled with unforgettable characters” (Elizabeth Graver), and “an unparalleled triumph” in its portrayal of Israel’s marginalized communities (Ranen Omer-Sherman). With agile prose and unforgettable characters, Tsabari gives voice to experiences too often silenced, weaving together personal stories and broader histories of upheaval and survival.",1,1761192834.0,StLouis,0,1.0,False

My wife and I are planning to buy a house in a year or two and are exploring neighborhood options. I’ve lived in Portland for nearly ten years in various neighborhoods in NE (Sullivans Gulch, Williams area, Kenton, overlook). 

We’re in our early 30s, queer couple, no kids but we’d like to live somewhere that would be solid should we decide to. Open to close suburbs if they’re liberal and charming. We are hoping for a neighborhood that’s walkable at least within distance to a coffee shop and a grocery store. My dream is Laurelhurst or Alameda but I’m curious as there’s so many places in this city we haven’t explored!

1odtq3f,https://www.reddit.com/r/relationships/comments/1odtq3f/still_loving_still_breaking/,"Still Loving, Still Breaking","
(31M , 30F)
Sometimes, it’s not the fights that break a relationship — it’s the silence.
The slow vanishing.
The distance that creeps in without warning.

The feeling of watching someone you love emotionally walk away,
while still physically being around.

A girl and a boy spent a decade loving each other — through ordinary days and big moments. From good health to surgeries, from spontaneous brunches to shared silences under the stars. They built a rhythm, a bond, a life threaded with care.

But love, no matter how deep, is not immune to change.

She remembers when they spoke every day.
Calls. Messages. Sunday brunches.
Late-night coffee and ice cream rides.
Their presence in each other’s lives was effortless — natural, unforced.

But now, the conversations are gone.
The meetings, rare.
The only answer she gets is:

“I’m busy. I have work. I need space. I want my freedom.”

Yes, life can get busy. But sudden, complete withdrawal rarely means just a packed schedule.
It often signals something deeper.

What once felt like a shelter now feels like something he’s trying to escape.

And then, one day, he said it — “I don’t feel the same anymore.”
He didn’t end it outright.
He just stopped showing up.

Where there was once daily connection, now there’s emptiness.
She found herself waiting, questioning, aching for presence in a space filled with absence.

And still, she held on —
Not because she couldn’t see the change,
But because love doesn’t switch off just because someone else’s feelings have faded.

She starts to question herself — her needs, her expectations, her emotions.
People call her “too emotional,” “too attached.”
But how do you unlove someone who became your world for ten years?
How do you stop feeling, when love became a habit, a heartbeat, a rhythm stitched into your very being?

She wonders:

Is it wrong to want time — when time once flowed so freely?
Is it wrong to feel broken when something you nurtured for a decade now feels like a burden to the other person?

And the answer is: No. It’s not wrong. Not at all.

She wasn’t wrong for expecting care.
Expecting communication and connection after years of shared life is not a crime.
She isn’t wrong for feeling hurt.
Or confused by the shift.

Because real love becomes a part of you.
And when it’s withdrawn, the pain isn’t just sadness.
It’s disorientation.
It’s grieving someone still alive — someone who no longer sees you.

It’s trauma.
And trauma doesn’t arrive with dramatic exits — it shows up in the silence between messages. In the coldness of a once-familiar voice.
In the ache of becoming invisible to someone who once made you feel seen.

When she finally spoke about her pain,
he didn’t comfort her —
he counted.

“I’ve done so much for you. I carried more weight. I sacrificed more than you.”

Maybe he meant it. Maybe he was exhausted. Maybe he gave all he could and ran out of love.
But love is NOT a scoreboard.
And care, once given freely, shouldn’t become a burden of resentment later.

Yes, he helped her when she was unwell.
But did she not show up for him in her own ways?
Was she not there — in time, in presence, in emotion?

Now, it feels like everything she thought was love
has been reduced to a tally of effort.
And she’s left wondering:

Was it love or obligation?
Was it care or convenience?
Was it real, or was it always conditional?

Because when someone says,
“I did this and that for you — now I can’t anymore,”
It stops sounding like love
and starts sounding like a transaction.

And love isn’t meant to be earned.
It’s meant to be shared. Supported. Felt.
Especially when it’s hard.

But then came the moment that shook everything —
She said she didn’t want to live anymore.
Not for attention. But from raw, exhausted pain.

Suddenly, he called.
He messaged.
He said he cared. He promised to check in.

But now she wonders — why now?
Not when she was struggling silently.
Not when she cried alone.
Not when she begged for time.

Only when her words became terrifying.
Did he come back out of love — or out of fear?
Out of guilt — or consequence?

This is where trust breaks.
Because when someone vanishes when you need them most,
and reappears only when you collapse —
how do you know their return is real?

Now she’s caught in the storm:

Her heart still loves.
Her mind still remembers.
But her spirit is tired.

She knows the imbalance.
She sees the change.
But she can’t let go — not easily.

Because he wasn’t just a person.
He became a part of her.
Letting go of him feels like letting go of herself.

So is she wrong to feel this way?

No.
She’s human.
She’s hurting.
She’s healing.

And healing from a love like this doesn’t happen overnight.
She is not wrong.
Not for feeling.
Not for hoping.
Not even for struggling to let go.

Because grief doesn’t follow logic.
And love doesn’t end just because it hurts.

Her pain is real.
Her confusion valid.
Her longing deeply human.

But now — a question lingers:
Is it wise to open the same door again?

That answer will come. Gently. Slowly. Honestly.

If he truly wants to stay — not to silence her despair, but to support her healing —
his actions will speak. Over time. Through consistency.

Not just when she’s breaking. But when she’s simply being.

Until then, she’s allowed to feel it all.
To cry. To question. To remember.
To grieve.

And one day — maybe not today — she will feel lighter.
Clearer.
Stronger.

Because no one is wrong for loving deeply.
But everyone deserves a love that stays —
Not just when it’s easy. But when it’s needed the most.

Are these too common these days? What are your views? How do you deal with it? It's just poetic version of real story which I written for the book. But I still want to know what are your views?

TL;DR A long relationship, but suddenly one person stopped feeling the same for any reason. What should other person do?",1,1761192789.0,relationships,0,1.0,False

---

Hello! First of all, I want to thank all of the people who took a minute to provide some advice on my last post. At the time, I felt overwhelmed and didn't answer the comments, but I read them all.

I wanted to update you.

After writing the post, I decided to talk to my husband again, this time in a calm space, about the boundaries in the house. He told me he was going to have a talk with his parents, and he did. I won't say it was the biggest success, but things at home have surely improved. I stopped locking my door, and they started to knock. Sometimes they still knock and open the door immediately afterwards, but most of the time they don't come in, so I regained some space and peace of mind.

Some of you addressed the financial situation, where I was taking on the house's financial responsibility, and that plays a big part in what happened next.

I had a C-section; my pregnancy was high risk. Fortunately, the baby was born fine, but I had some complications. I lost a lot of blood and I almost lost my uterus. The surgery took almost two hours; I threw up many times and almost passed out. During this time, my partner took care of the baby. After the surgery, they left me in observation. The doctor said I might need a transfusion, but he ordered some tests to check my hemoglobin levels. Hubby and the baby were allowed to be in the room with me. I tried to breastfeed the baby, but I was so weak I ended up throwing up every time and was afraid my arms couldn't hold her. After 12 hours and a transfusion, I was sent to my room and held my baby for the first time.

The next days were hard. In those moments when the painkillers' effects were fading, my whole body hurt. The baby didn't want to latch, and the nurses, who were supposedly there to help me, would just grab my breast and the baby's head and push them together, most of the time with no luck. I ended up staying in the hospital for two extra nights because my hemoglobin levels were too low for me to be discharged. For those extra nights, the insurance barely covered any of the expenses, and I ended up using my savings to pay, leaving me with very little money.

When we first came home, it was horrible. I struggled to feed my baby, and although I stopped feeling any pain (I have a high tolerance for it), I felt my body go numb, and everything was harder. Also, the very next day after we arrived, they brought my niece to the room. She just wanted to play, and they wanted me to pay attention to her and the baby at the same time. I just couldn't, and I dissociated. In the following days, my in-laws wanted to arrange visits and have everyone come see the baby and me. They didn't ask me or my husband; when I turned around, there were some of my husband's family members visiting. They are the kind of family that stays for hours and hours. Since I didn't want to leave the room, hubby took the baby downstairs for the visit, and I stayed in the room crying. I just wanted peace and quiet. 
After that visit, I talked to my husband and put my foot down: I would not allow any visits if they didn't ask us first. After that, the only visit we had was from my husband's cousin. I did not want that visit either, but he was going to lend us some money, and it felt transactiona, he got to meet the baby in exchange for the money. I hated this, but we needed the money.
I made it trough the first couple of weeks by removing my self mentally from many situations, in my mind i created a baby and me bubble...


The next couple of weeks were calmer. I held onto my baby and barely left the room. It wasn't until my best friend came to visit (she made a trip all the way from France) that I realized I was feeling better. I even went out for coffee and left the baby with hubby and my mother-in-law.

Since then, the baby and space situation has gotten better. My mother-in-law takes care of the baby for three to five hours a day so I can nap and do my own thing. Somehow, she has become more respectful of my boundaries (both with the baby and personally), and she is being a great help. I'm about to go back to work (remotely), and I feel confident she can take care of the baby during the morning and will respect most of the boundaries I've set (not all of them, but we are still working on this).

As for hubby, he hasn't gotten a job. I talked to him; he says he is depressed, that moving here took a toll on him, and that he froze. We also had a big fight, and I almost left the house. It turned out he had taken out a loan, gambled, and lost the money. I found out because a collection agency called me. I was set to leave, and he begged me to stay. Call me an idiot if you want, but I did stay.

We made an agreement. He says he is going to fix everything: pay off the loan, get us out of his parents' house, pay back the loan I have (I had an existing loan, and no one will give me another one), and buy a cheap car. The deadline for him to do this is February 28th. If he doesn't deliver, I have set my mind to get a divorce.

In the meantime, we've made some commitments, like having a weekly check-in, exercising, and going to therapy as soon as our financial situation allows it. Also, he has until Monday to find the kind of job that he wants; if he doesn't get it, he will take any job (McDonald's, mopping floors, anything).

Right now, we have run out of money. All I have left is enough to buy a can of formula and a pack of diapers. Besides the cousin who lent us some money, no one else in his family will help. On my end, the situation is similar. Some of my relatives could help, but I feel that if I ask, it will be too much; they already gave us some expensive things when the baby was born. My mother and sister just make ends meet. My mom lost her job and started baking cakes to have an income. My sister just got promoted, so things will get better for both of them, but I don't want to ask for anything unless it's for the baby.

If it comes to a point where we run out of food, I might ask my dad. We don't have a good relationship; he was abusive when I was a kid. But he called me yesterday and told me that if at any point I struggled, I could reach out to him. I want to avoid asking him for anything if I can, because of our relationship, but I have no pride if it's for my kid.

I am almost back to work and will get my paycheck in mid-November. Until then, I won't touch the money I have unless it's for the baby's milk or diapers. If everything gets worse financially, I will crash on my mom's couch with the baby until I get paid. But I have hope that hubby will get a job next week and everything will be better.

I know I might seem naive, and you will probably say that I should take my things and leave. Sometimes I feel that way; I just want to grab my baby, run, and never stop running. Maybe I'm old school, or maybe just stupid, but when I got married, I meant it when I said that we were meant to be together for better or for worse. So I'm willing to give hubby a chance to prove himself. Hopefully, he will, and if not... I guess the sun will shine regardless.",1,1761192592.0,AITAH,0,1.0,False

The seats smelled like leather and car smell.

2025’s cars weren’t exactly the future I’d imagined. 

Sleek and overpriced, sure, but not a single one could fly. 

I used to picture 2025 as a utopia, all chrome skylines and hoverboards. 

Instead, I got capitalism and fast-food bags crammed in the glove compartment. The world was so much more colourless. Across the street, there was a McDonald's. But I only recognized it from the logo. 

Gone was the fun, colourful establishment, where Nick and I would spend our Saturday nights playing foosball, or even goofing in the kids play area. 

All of it was gone, replaced with sliding glass doors and sterile windows. 

Just another monotonous building purged from the strip.  McDonald's had become exactly what it hated. 

A brand stripped of its soul.

Sinking into plush seats, I averted my gaze. Even the people resembled robots. The same clothes and hair styles. 

There was no individuality. This world was shapeless. Dystopian. So much for Back to the Future. I jumped when the glowing rectangle sitting on the driver's seat flashed. Hesitantly, I picked it up. Weightless, fitting perfectly into my palm. 

I peered closer, stabbing the screen. It flashed again. Something ice cold skittered down my spine. 

*Didn't Nick have one of these things?*

A familiar melody began to play, faint at first, growing louder. 

“We're talking away

I don't know what I'm to say

I'll say it anyway

Today is another day to find you

Shyin' away

Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay—”

The device slipped from my hands, my palm hitting my mouth. No. I grasped for it, my stomach rolling, my throat burning. 

I squeezed it in my hands like it was my anchor, like this was the only thing left; the only thing tethering me to my humanity. I wanted to push it away. I wanted to throw the stupid glowing rectangle out of the window. But I couldn't. Suddenly, I could breathe again. 

The smells slammed into me, violent, a wave of nostalgia and agony. 

Candy, rain, Nick’s cheap cologne, and 1989.  I didn't need to breathe, and yet somehow I was panting, breathless, the world shifted side to side and I was back on my parents roof overlooking a starry night. Nick was next to me, his legs resting on mine, head on my shoulder. 

I didn't realize I was crying until I had to swipe at my eyes, my throat scratching, my voice hoarse.

How? 

I frantically tapped at the glowing rectangle. There was no tape player, no on button, and it wasn't coming from the radio. I checked it twice. The music was coming from the rectangle. It didn't make sense. 

How could the barista have Nick’s favorite song? 

Footsteps startled me. The barista pulled open the door and eased into the drivers seat, dumping a bag of fast food on my lap. I didn't move, shoving the rectangle between my legs. He was damp from the rain, strands of sticky brown glued to his forehead, raindrops spattering his jacket.

His scent wasn't a threat, easily curling into my nose and throat. Fast food, sweat and cigarette smoke. But already, my nerve endings were on fire. This guy knew Nick’s favorite song. Which meant he knew me. 

“Okay, so I grabbed you a coffee since vampires apparently like coffee or whatever, but you owe me for it, I had to pay extra for extra cream and I don't even know if you drink it,” he announced through a mouthful of burger meat, pressing a button, and the car roared to life. 

He clicked in his seat-belt before turning to me, swallowing down burger mush. “Yo.” His expression pinched, lip curling. “You okay?” 

Instead of responding, I held up the glowing rectangle. “Your device,” I whispered. “How did you get that song?” I had to bite into my tongue to hold back. “Was it you? Did *you* turn Nick into a human?” 

The guy’s expression crumpled. “Huh?” 

I didn't hesitate, throwing my fist back, and slamming it into his nose. 

His head arched back and slammed against the window. I lunged for the door, but it was locked. “What the fuck?” he snapped, snatching the glowing rectangle.

“That’s my phone!” the barista yelled, slamming his hand over his nose. “It’s Spotify, you idiot.”

Blood. The smell hit me, sharp, electric, suffocating. My head whipped around before my brain could register it, a slow rivulet of red seeping down his nose. 

It hit like I imagined drugs would. My vision blurred, feathering in and out of view. Logic burned away, and I moved. Fast. Too fast too keep up with. Somehow, I straddled him, pinning him to the seat. 

Leaning closer, the stench was worse and yet better, stronger than Nick’s scent, that was I was so used to, filling me, like home. 

This was different. Dangerous. The guy didn't move, his eyes strayed on me, breath tickling my cheeks. His heartbeat was steady, pulse slightly elevated, pumping through his carotid artery. 

I ignored the feral, impulsive part of me drawing me to the curve of his throat; I ignored the sharp burning on my tongue, the dull aching rattling through my upper incisors. Gently pressing my fingers to his temples, I exhaled, applying pressure. 

Compulsion was all part of mindfulness, I was told. If you are not relaxed, then the human mind will not subjugate. 

I breathed in and out, and the guy’s expression relaxed, his pupils dilating, facial muscles weakening. 

All right. I gently applied pressure again. 

“I want you to tell me everything.”

“Yes, master.” The barista droned, his hands dropping to his sides. I caught his lip quirk slightly. He leaned forward, lips curving into a smug smirk.

“Hi.”

I retracted my fingers.

“You're mocking me again.” I bit back a hiss. “Why can't I control you?” 

He sighed, making a show of pushing me back and dropped the act. 

“Because I actually paid attention in Vampire 101: Resisting Compulsion. They had the Twilight PSA drilled into us as kids.” He folded his arms. “Blink, count to ten. Blink again. That's how you win. Invite them in, and the monsters win.”",1,1761192291.0,u_Trash_Tia,0,1.0,False

[Original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/AYjsD4X3UY): **July 18, 2025**

I (27F) and my fiancé (27F) are getting married in November and have been planning our wedding.

It’s been mostly smooth sailing since the big announcement other than my mother being rude and dismissive of my partner. They don’t know each other well since my mom either ignores her or is very short. Not long after the announcement my mom called me to ask if I was taking “that woman’s” name.

But outside of that there hadn’t been much trouble until my grandma told her we were having the cake testing (my grandma is having our wedding at her house and agreed to help pay for the cake, so she came to the testing with us). According to my grandma, my mom said “oh, they are actually getting married?” My grandma then explained that she pointed out how strange it was for my mom to not be involved in my life or relationship and she felt like my mom would be more included in wedding planning if she showed interest. I knew instantly that this would set my mother off.

Later that night I got a call from my mom where she screamed at me, telling me my fiancé has to be a criminal to be interested in me. That our wedding was shady because it’s not traditional, and that my fiancé changed me as a person. She said I have grown hateful ever since I moved out of her house (for context I lived at home for many years because my dad had terminal cancer). After this screaming rant where my fiancé was getting more and more upset beside me, my mom let me know that my grandma decided she didn’t want the wedding at her house, but that I shouldn’t worry because she’d fix everything for me.

After talking to my grandma, it was revealed that my mother called her and gave her a list of reasons not to have my wedding. My grandma is easily swayed by my mother, so she agreed at the time. I called my mom back, upset. I think that was when she realized she kind of messed up. She intended to get my wedding canceled so she could get a “better” venue and be the hero and pay for everything. But my grandmas house has emotional significance to me. Luckily after talking to my grandma again, she realized my mom’s manipulations and changed her mind.

I was crushed for days after. Not only about my mom trying to use her typical narcissistic manipulations to change my wedding, but also how blasé my grandma was about canceling on me. Truthfully, it’s been like pulling teeth to get any excitement or interest from my family about my upcoming marriage.

My mom’s second attempt at ruining not only my wedding but my relationship happened the other day. She called me to chat (I was very short with her because I am still upset), during the call she asked if my fiancé was in the room and after I said yes she told me I was probably pregnant. You can see how that would cause tension. Luckily my fiancé knows my mom’s behaviors and doesn’t believe a word she says, but I was left reeling that my mom would try to drop a seed of doubt between my relationship. My sister called me later that day and told me that my mother is telling the whole family that I’m pregnant.

I’m tired and we still have 4.5 months to go until the wedding.

❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Is it that you are getting married, or is it that you are gay?

Either way, fuck that. I would seriously cut off anything that treated my serious relationship that way.

> **OOP:**I think it’s a mix of both. She claims she’s not homophobic but then says homophobic stuff. Plus she’s always wanted me attached at her hip

**Commenter 2:** Just because she's, your mother does not mean you have to interact with her. If a stranger treated you this way, what would you do? Treat your mother the same way

> **OOP:** Im mostly low contact with my mother. Before the wedding announcement there would be months of no contact unless something important came up. Now she’s inserting herself into my life again

**Commenter 3:** First off it sounds like your mom is pissed you’re marrying another female. Please stand up for your fiancée at all times and it’s interesting that anyone would believe you were doing IVF all this time to get pregnant without anyone knowing.

> **OOP:** I’ve dated both men and women, so I think she’s trying to imply I’m cheating

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/r/weddingdrama/s/fcQUwgLRhx): **October 16, 2025 (nearly three months later)**

So a lot of things have been going on lately and now we are a month away from our wedding. Since the first time I posted, things have calmed down a lot and everything seems to be smooth sailing outside a few comments from my mother.

It started off with her asking me to move back in with her temporarily, which I turned down. Then it turned into her talking about getting a new house and selling the one she lives in currently to something smaller where it could be just her, my sister, and I. Then on my birthday, she kept commenting that things were about to “go back to normal” and “soon everything will be okay again”. That paired with her bringing up my ex relationships and asking if I talked to any of them in front of my fiance was putting me in a pretty bad mood.

Yesterday morning my fiance and I decided to head to the court house bright and early to apply for our marriage license since we had the morning free before we had to go to work. While there, we started talking and making plans.

So I'm thrilled to announce that yesterday evening my WIFE and I eloped at a Red Robin.

Everything has been turned in and made official and you are now hearing from a married woman who has one heck of a celebratory party planned a month from now.

Also no one outside my sister who was a witness and a few close friends I trust know. So if my mother tries to object or mess up the ceremony, well tough. Can't stop a marriage when someone is already married.

Thanks everyone who read and gave great advice.

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** Do you live in a state where you can do a self binding ceremony or did you get an officiant to marry you over bottomless fries? Either way I love it. Congratulations!

> **OOP:** We got a friend who is ordained to marry us over bottomless fries and pretzel bites

+

> We actually stopped at one of those parking lot coffee places and got coffee for the whole car (everyone carpooled with us)

**Commenter 2:** So happy you made it for yourselves and can shut down the haters!

Hopefully RR stays a special place for you both.

Definitely should pull contact with mom back. Like low contact. For your own sanity

> **OOP:** We actually went to red robin to celebrate after getting engaged so it's quickly becoming our place

**Has OOP gone low contact with her mother?**

> **OOP:** I am very low contact with my mom. The first time I've seen her since the original post was my birthday this past weekend. All comments I've heard have been second hand from being in the room when my mom called my sister and she didn't know it was on speaker. I respect what you're saying but that's not the situation. The only reason my mom was invited to the wedding was because it was required for my grandma not only to host the wedding but also help pay for it.

**OOP responds to a downvoted comment regarding having a ""fake""  ceremony where OOP's mother will be there. Does OOP's mother know she's married?**

> **OOP:** We are still having a wedding ceremony for the family and they don’t know we are already married. If my mom stands up randomly and tries to object the wedding or make a scene and get the wedding stopped, it won’t change anything because me and my wife and already married

+

> Yes they know we are already married. My wife’s childhood best friend wants to officiate the big family ceremony.

+

> To have pictures of us and all our friends. For the memory of the ceremony. It’s not really a fake ceremony either, it just doesn’t include signing the paperwork because we already did that. Marriage and a wedding is more than a legal status

Captain Gutiérrez woke before sunrise, as he always did. The barracks still slept while he shaved in the half-light, humming a tune that barely reached his reflection. He pressed a clean shirt, dabbed a bit of cologne on his jacket's collar and smiled at himself.

By the time he stepped outside, the camp was beginning to stir. The air carried the scent of oil, dust, and coffee. He greeted everyone he passed, from the sleepy sentries at the gate to the cook dragging sacks of rice across the yard. A handshake here, a pat on the shoulder there.

“Morning, Captain.”  
  
“Morning, son. How’s the wife?”  
  
“She’s fine, sir.”  
  
“Good. Keep it that way. And tell her that stew she sent last week is still being talked about.”

They laughed. They always laughed around him. Gutiérrez had a way of turning even idle talk into something people wanted to be part of.

He reached his office when the sun had already cleared the horizon. The desk, as usual, was stacked with papers: leave requests, repair logs, requisition forms. Most officers saw these as chores; Gutiérrez treated them like conversations. Every name on the page belonged to someone he’d spoken with, eaten with, or helped dig a jeep out of the mud. He didn’t just sign; he read, remembered, and noted the small things, a sick mother or a mechanic who needed better tools.

By noon, the paperwork was finished. He hung his jacket, rolled up his sleeves and walked toward the motor pool.

The yard shimmered under the midday heat. Men worked stripped to their undershirts, the clang of tools echoing off corrugated roofs. The smell of grease was everywhere.

“¡Mi jefe!” shouted the chief mechanic as he spotted him. The two men met halfway with a hearty hug.

“How’s she running?” asked Gutiérrez, glancing at the jeep suspended by a chain above its chassis.

“Badly,” the mechanic said, wiping his hands on a rag. “Those white-necks roughed her up during the demonstrations. They burned out the engine.”

Gutiérrez crouched to look under the hood. “It shouldn’t be a problem,” he said. “I signed the order for the spare parts yesterday. They should’ve arrived by now.”

The mechanic scoffed. “Yeah. But your friend in the general’s office doesn’t want anyone finding out about his little off-the-road adventure. So we haven’t received a damn thing.”

Gutiérrez exhaled through his nose, stood up, and brushed his palms together. “I’ll go talk to him,” he said, his smile still firmly in place. Then, softening, he added, “Anything else giving you trouble?”

The mechanic shook his head. “No, not really. We’ll have the truck ready for tomorrow.”

“Good man.” He smiled. “Keep some of that coffee for me.”

Gutiérrez walked back to his office and donned his jacket, hiding the grease stains in the back of his shirt and then made his way to the administrative wing. As he opened the door, the smell of cigarettes and stale coffee invaded him. Still, he adjusted his uniform jacket before knocking twice on the wooden door marked *Col. E. Ramírez — Commanding Officer.*

“Enter,” came a dry voice from within.

The colonel’s office was as orderly as a parade ground. Every document stacked to perfect alignment, the floor polished to a dull gleam. Ramírez sat behind his desk, glasses perched low on his nose, a pen moving across a page with mechanical precision. He didn’t look up until Gutiérrez stopped in front of him.

“Colonel,” said Gutiérrez, hands clasped behind his back. “I came to discuss the spare parts requisition for the jeep in the motor pool. The one with the burnt motor.”

“That request,” said Ramírez, setting down his pen, “was denied.”

Gutiérrez tilted his head slightly, maintaining a polite smile. “Denied? I must have misunderstood the reason, sir.”

“There’s nothing to misunderstand. Those parts are reserved.”

“Reserved for what purpose?”

Ramírez’s gaze hardened. “For whatever purpose I decide, Captain. That should suffice.”

The air in the room thickened, though Gutiérrez’s expression didn’t falter. He took a slow breath and approached the desk just enough to speak at a conversational tone.

“With respect, sir, the vehicles in question are needed for the patrols along the coastal road. The men have been running maintenance shifts since last week. Without those parts—”

“Without those parts,” interrupted Ramírez, “they’ll find something else to do. The base isn’t about to collapse because one jeep is out of commission.”

Gutiérrez nodded slightly, as if weighing the colonel’s words. “Still, it strikes me as odd that a working vehicle would be held up like this. We don’t usually run short on replacements.”

Ramírez leaned back in his chair, lips tightening. “You’re treading close to impertinence, Captain.”

“I apologize, sir.” Gutiérrez’s voice was calm. “I’m simply trying to understand the situation. My men are asking questions I don’t have answers for.”

The colonel’s eyes darted briefly to the window, just a flicker, but enough for Gutiérrez to notice. Outside, parked discreetly near the far wall of the compound, was a gleaming staff jeep with the same serial prefix as the one awaiting parts. The realization slid neatly into place.

“I assure you, Colonel,” he continued, as if nothing had passed between them, “my only concern is operational readiness. The trucks will carry the rations, but the jeeps, well, they carry the officers, the messages, the image of efficiency. It wouldn’t look good if one were left half-disassembled in front of the men.”

Ramírez’s hand froze above his papers. 

Gutiérrez’s smile softened. “If it’s a matter of discretion, I can see to it personally that the repairs are handled quietly. No reports, no noise. You’ll have your vehicle running before the week is out.”

The colonel drummed his fingers on the desk, a soft, rhythmic sound that betrayed irritation more than thought. “You’re an ambitious man, Captain.”

“I’m a practical one,” said Gutiérrez, still smiling.

Ramírez studied him for a long moment, jaw tightening, before finally reaching for the phone. “Warehouse,” he barked into the receiver. “Authorize the release of the spare parts for Vehicle 342. Send them to the motor pool immediately.”

He hung up and looked at Gutiérrez again. “If I hear so much as a whisper about this, Captain, it won’t be my image that suffers. Do we understand each other?”

“Perfectly, sir.”

“Good.”

As Gutiérrez turned to leave, the colonel added, almost grudgingly, “You should’ve been a politician.”

Gutiérrez paused at the doorway and glanced back with a faint grin. “God forbid. I prefer engines. They’re more honest.”

He stepped into the corridor, the door clicking shut behind him. The smile lingered just long enough for him to exhale. When he returned to the mechanic yard, the men were still hunched over their work. The chief mechanic straightened up at the sight of him.

“Well?”

“The colonel changed his mind,” said Gutiérrez. “We’ll have what we need before sunset.”

The mechanic raised an eyebrow. “You convinced him?”

“Let’s just say,” Gutiérrez said, smiling faintly, “we reached an understanding.”

By late afternoon, the spare parts had arrived as promised. The motor pool came alive with renewed energy. Gutiérrez stayed a while, overseeing quietly, offering a few words of praise here and there. Then he took a seat by the open workshop door, coffee in hand, and picked up a sports magazine from the table beside him.

He wasn’t much of a reader, but he liked baseball, as did any self-respecting Venezuelan, and there was no other way to catch the games. As he turned the page, a headline caught his eye — *Cervecería Caracas Beats Navegantes del Magallanes, 3–2.* He smiled, taking a slow sip. It was a good day: victory on the field, victory in the yard.

At least until the next car arrived.

Two men stepped out, their shoes polished enough to catch the afternoon glare. Tan suits, no insignia. They moved through the workers without a word, heading straight for Gutiérrez.

One of them rested a hand lightly on his shoulder.

“Captain Gutiérrez?”

He turned, still holding his cup. “Yes? What can I help you with?”

The second man reached into his jacket and produced a small leather badge. Embossed in silver was the symbol every officer in Caracas knew: a Mucuchíes dog clutching a knife between its teeth.

“Please come with us,” the man said.

The captain’s eyes lingered on the badge for a heartbeat. Around them, the mechanic yard kept humming, oblivious. Gutiérrez set down his coffee carefully, straightened his uniform, and nodded once.

“All right,” he said.

1odtizd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CuriousAF/comments/1odtizd/how_to_tell_if_a_guy_is_into_you_underrated_signs/,How to tell if a guy is into you: underrated signs that most people miss (but science proves true),"You’d think we’d all be better at reading signs of attraction by now. But nope. Most people still confuse politeness with flirtation and mixed signals with mystery. It’s wild how many of my friends (and Reddit threads) are full of people asking, “Is he just being nice or does he like me??”

This post is based on actual behavioral research, psychology books, and expert interviews—not TikTok “dating coaches” who just recycle the same five body language tips with zero nuance. I’ve also pulled insights from neurobiology and social dynamics research. So yeah, this isn’t just vibes.

Here are signs that a man is genuinely interested, based on actual science and some underrated cues most people miss.

- **He mirrors you without realizing it**  
  According to Dr. Tanya Chartrand’s research at Duke University, people subconsciously mimic the body language of those they're attracted to. If he crosses his legs when you do, leans in when you lean in, or picks up your speech patterns, that’s not random. That’s a real thing called the “chameleon effect” and it shows unconscious social bonding.

- **He laughs more around you—even when things aren’t that funny**  
  A study published in the journal *Evolutionary Psychology* found that men are more likely to laugh around women they’re attracted to, and they’ll also try harder to make them laugh. If he’s cracking jokes more than usual or chuckling at your sarcasm, he’s trying to build emotional sync.

- **His pupils dilate**  
  Super subtle, but yeah—pupil dilation is a real biological response tied to attraction. A study in *Psychology Today* explained that when we find someone attractive, our pupils naturally dilate due to dopamine release. If his eyes seem wider or more intense when he looks at you, that’s not nothing.

- **He finds ways to lightly touch you—but respectfully**  
  Not in a creepy way. Think brushing your arm when you laugh, touching your hand “accidentally,” or guiding you through a crowd with a hand on the lower back. Social psychologist Dr. Monica Moore found in her research that subtle tactile contact is one of the most consistent predictors of interest in early-stage attraction.

- **He remembers weird little details you barely mentioned**  
  Most guys aren't memorizing your favorite childhood snack from a random convo unless they care. Active listening is a high-cost behavior. If he recalls your dog’s name, your favorite podcast, or the fact that you hate cilantro? That’s emotional investment.

- **He initiates plans—even small ones**  
  Men who are interested stop being passive. It doesn’t always have to be a grand date. Sometimes it’s “Want to grab a coffee this week?” or “This reminded me of that show you like, want to watch it together?” If he’s trying to create time with you, that’s a major tell.

- **He’s curious about your opinions—and actually listens**  
  Men who ask thoughtful questions beyond surface level? That’s not just being friendly. A study in the *Journal of Social and Personal Relationships* found that showing genuine curiosity about a person’s worldview is a strong predictor of romantic interest. Not just “What do you do for work?” but “How did you end up doing that?” or “What would your dream life look like?”

- **He gets a little nervous—or tries harder to impress**  
  Watch how he acts around others vs. around you. Does his posture shift? Is he suddenly more aware of how he’s presenting himself? Social anxiety researcher Dr. Jeremy Nicholson notes that subtle signs of nervousness—like fidgeting, voice changes, or adjusting clothes—can be strong indicators of attraction, especially if it only happens around you.

Here are a few tools that can help if you want to understand this better or decode social cues more easily:

- **""Come As You Are"" by Emily Nagoski**  
  This isn’t just about attraction—it’s about how human desire works. Nagoski is a PhD researcher and award-winning educator who breaks down complex neuroscience into plain English. This book will make you question everything you think you know about attraction, biology, and romantic behavior. Insanely good read. Best book I’ve found on decoding desire dynamics.

- **""The Art of Seduction"" by Robert Greene**  
  Controversial? Yes. But also packed with psychological truths about human behavior. Greene explores historical seduction as a social art form and unpacks the archetypes people fall into when they’re trying to attract someone. It’s not a manual for manipulation—it’s a deep dive into how power, attention, and desire actually function.

- **""Why Men Love Bitches"" by Sherry Argov**  
  Don’t be fooled by the title. This book is less about being mean and more about how confidence and boundaries are the biggest turn-ons. It flips the traditional dating narrative and explains why being too available can backfire.

- **BeFreed (app)**  
  This is an AI-powered learning app built by a team from Columbia University. It turns books, expert research, and interviews into personalized podcast-style lessons. If you want to learn more about social psychology, attraction, or relationship patterns but don’t have time to read four books? This is perfect. You can pick how deep you want to go—10, 20, or 40-minute episodes. It also lets you pick your host’s tone and voice (mine is set to “curious, funny”). It recommends content based on your past listens and builds you a personalized learning roadmap as you go. Also, it has every book I mentioned already in its system, so you can deep dive instantly.

- **Podcast: ""Modern Love"" by The New York Times**  
  Real stories, real emotions, real mess. This one helps you understand how complex and non-linear attraction can be. If you’re trying to make sense of mixed signals, this one’s gold.

- **YouTube: The School of Life**  
  Not cheesy. Super deep. They break down dating psychology and relationship dynamics in a way that feels philosophical but clear. Their videos on “How to Know If Someone Likes You” or “Why We Fall for Certain People” are spot on.

- **App: Hinge Voice Prompts**  
  If you’re dating and want to listen for signs of interest, Hinge is surprisingly good. Their voice prompts feature lets you hear tone, pacing, playfulness—all the stuff that text hides. You can tell so much more from the way someone says “Tell me more” than from any emoji.

Attraction is messy. It’s rarely as obvious as rom-coms make it seem. But there are patterns. And once you start to notice them, it’s easier to tell genuine interest from politeness or game-playing.

Throwaway account. 

My wife (F, 37) and I (M, 38) are from two different cultures. I am from Europe and my wife is from the Middle East. We live in Canada. My birthday was two nights ago and my wife got me a small cake, my favorite cake from my favorite bakery. My mother-in-law was at our home for dinner. We cut the cake and after dinner my wife went to put our baby to bed.

I was supposed to give MIL a ride to my sister-in-law’s place. MIL grabbed the leftover cake in the box to take with her. I asked her if she was taking the leftover cake and she said yes, for SIL and her son. I said, “But that is my favorite cake and I was hoping to eat the leftover tomorrow.” She seemed really insulted and said that I had already had cake and that I was being petty because I was taking the cake from a five-year-old boy. I said, “Fine, take the cake.”

After I came back, I told my wife and she said it is a cultural thing. You have to share the cake and I was rude and owe MIL an apology because I made her feel bad.

AITAH for not wanting to apologize and thinking I deserved the leftover cake?

Added later : it was a small 6 inches cake . The left over was about half of the cake

**AITAH has no consensus bot, OOP was NTA**

**Relevant Comments**

**Commenter 1:** NTA. It's pretty normal to expect the leftovers to be yours when someone brings you a birthday cake.

> **OOP:** I felt like crap haha she said so you are not sharing with a 5 year old ?

**OOP responds to a downvoted comment about sharing the leftovers with the five years old and get another birthday cake for himself** 

> **OOP:** Why should I buy myself another cake ? I just wanted the left over of my birthday cake

**The birthday cake flavor**

> **OOP:** Parisian chocolate cake

**Commenter 2:** If you’re expected to share your cake with all and sundry, why didn’t your wife buy you a bigger cake? That way, you could share with everyone and still be able to enjoy several pieces of the cake you were *gifted.* That “expectation” seems a little sus to me.

> **OOP:** I asked my wife this since it was posted here a few times. She said originally her mom was supposed to sleep at our house that night but her sister needed help so mil decided to go there. Her mom decided to surprise the SIL and her son with the left over cake . She thought we all had a slice so she just grabbed the box to take it there. I don’t know their language so I can’t confirm if this was all a miscommunication/misunderstanding or it’s a cultural thing or they asked MIL to bring some cake

**Commenter 3:** This is an Arabic hosting thing, as well as tyrannical MIL. Arabic mothers and grandmothers tend to fawn over boys and use girls for work. I personally knew a man who was breastfed until he was 5, while sisters were weaned at 6 months. Boys are emperors. Depending on the country, in the ME, if a guest admires something, the host gives it to him. In Saudi Arabia and Dubai, this goes to absurd lengths. Don’t complement someone’s watch in his home. He might feel obligated to give it to you. (This depends on socioeconomic level and class.) Once MIL grabbed your birthday cake, it became rude to take it back. She knew what she was doing. Get a replacement cake. In future, get a separate cake to either hide for leftovers, or send to in-laws’ “for the kids.”

> **OOP:** My wife was born in Dubai but her family is from Saudi
>> 
>> **Commenter 3:** Idk enough about saudi culture to say but i can tell you, this is not normal in my cultures. Its straight up rude and would start a family fight.
>>> 
>>> **OOP:** Thank you. This is very helpful. I understand cultural differences but I don’t appreciate being manipulated using “cultural thing”. In laws and I are finally civil ( they originally were against their daughter even dating me) and I try to be respectful as much as I can. I really don’t want to add extra stress on my wife but this incident bothered me so much

&nbsp;

[Update](https://www.reddit.com/u/Beneficial-Lab6495/s/FraCi1HqbG): **October 16, 2025**

Update: MIL and my birthday cake drama

I talked to my wife last night and told her that that I’ve decided not to have a birthday cake anymore. It seems to cause so much drama, so it’s easier if we just go to the bakery together, have a coffee, and share a slice of cake on the day instead. Thank you for your input

**Relevant / Top Comments**

**Commenter:** Oof I feel so bad for you, though, that you have to compromise on your birthday now moving forward. But also seems like this is a good way to set a boundary for yourself to limit drama. Not sure what culture your MIL is from, but I’m guessing from a more collective culture? I lived in a country once where for example on your birthday you had to treat the entire office to lunch, unlike the US where everyone treats you for your bday lol

**Commenter 2:** Maybe celebrate your birthday when MIL is not in your home.

> **OOP:** She doesn’t live here. She is visiting Canada. Hopefully next time she comes at a different time

**Commenter 3:** Perhaps your wife should purchase two birthday cakes and hide one in the back of the refrigerator. That way, your mother-in-law can feel like she's ""winning,"" and you can eat an entire 6-inch cake over the next couple of days.

**Commenter 4:** This is not a cultural thing, this is your wife's family thing. I'm from the middle east too. If you're happy with having the cake at the café, then yeah, your birthday. But I think it's rude for someone to just assume that they could take something from somebody else's house without asking. You don't owe your MIL an apology, your wife should have your back on this. But honestly, it's not a hill worth dying on, not a battle I'd pick, but I still wouldn't apologize. It is just a cake, and it's easy to get, not a lot of people would care, but we don't all have to care about what YOU care about, and it is *your* birthday cake, that's kind of special, and it is fun to see it again the next day. I'm sure your wife wouldn't like it if someone took something that's important to her without asking.

After doing a few hours of research I am truly unsure of what this lesion could be other than trauma. I could be wrong of course, but I just don't know what else it could possibly be? 

If anyone can guide me towards another possibility it would be very much appreciated.

For context, my patient is 28 year old healthy Hispanic male. He doesn't smoke or drink alcohol. He stated not having previous flare ups before. He doesn't floss. He doesn't like coffee nor did he eat or drink anything else that was hot. He says he noticed it three days prior to his visit after he woke up. It's been about a week and he says the inflammation is still there. He doesn't find it painful, more so bothersome because he can feel the lesion. Lifestyle is 50/50 meals from home and fast food with high sweet intake. 

The lesion is magenta in color and measures about 5mm x 7mm on the incisive papillae with two smaller lesions one measuring 1x1mm and the other measuring 2x2mm. Inflammation is also present on the facial surface but not as severe.

~~This is the second time this happened; the first time my grandfather took a bus back without telling anyone lmao.~~ 

So far, they're living in the same house as my close family (mother, sister, and me), but my aunts are thinking of renting a house for my grandparents to be easier to take turns taking care of them. But, anyway... 

Now that I'm actually seeing my grandfather's state, half of me goes ""he's ~82 and clearly needs help handling things"". The problem is that the other half goes ""HE TOSSED A CUP AT A WALL BECAUSE MY GRANDMA DIDN'T DO THE COFFEE THE WAY HE WANTED?! WTF lmao"". 

I guess you can have an idea of how he is based on that last paragraph but, just to give some more insights: he never really cared about his daughters when they were young, and he didn't really changed after he got older — my grandmother, on the other hand, at least asked her daughters to forgive her for the way she behaved in the past — but my aunts still think they have the duty to take care of him, for whatever reason...

Imagine a scientist at their station, gazing at a quantum setup, much like an explorer unraveling a new land. One part of this tale features a barrier punctuated by two slender slits; the other part, a detector anticipating revelations akin to an audience awaiting a magician's craft.

Now, as light or particles such as electrons journey through these slits, you might predict a straightforward performance—forming two clear lines on the detector, like orderly marbles. However, the universe opts for a more puzzling exhibition. What emerges is an interference pattern, suggesting that these particles are showcasing a more complex choreography—existing simultaneously in multiple states.

Here’s where it becomes even more intriguing: Attempts to observe these particles as they traverse the slits alter the scene dramatically. The graceful, wave-like pattern dissipates, replaced by particles selecting a direct path, as if awareness transforms their journey. This shift prompts profound questions about reality: Does observation alone weave the fabric of existence, turning us from mere spectators into active participants?

This transformation in behavior underscores a profound mystery—how observation could intertwine with existence. It’s not just a matter of particles at play; they’re perhaps indicating that consciousness is embedded deeply within the universe’s fabric. This interaction poses an enticing question: Could reality be a reflection of our perception, shaped by our attention and mind?

Venturing into this quantum wonderland presents a mind-bending proposition: The essence of what we call 'real' might hinge more on intricate connections rather than isolated facts. The Double-Slit Experiment peels back the layers to reveal that the universe is filled with perplexities that challenge our definitions of reality, hinting at our integral role in its dance. Whether pondering quantum phenomena or sipping your morning coffee, consider this: Your mere presence influences existence itself.

The next time you reflect on the Double-Slit Experiment, let its profound implications inspire a sense of wonder and curiosity. Reality, after all, is a remarkable interplay of interconnected players, with you actively engaged not just in observation, but in shaping the narrative where observer and observed unite. Embrace this realization as an invitation to explore the vast complexities of existence, right from the frontlines. https://www.firebringerai.com/what-is-the-double-slit-experiment-and-what-does-it-reveal-about-reality/",1,1761191578.0,FirebringerAI,0,1.0,False

hi everyone!

i have good news and i have bad news. what do you want first? the good news? ok, well... that crayon you ate? turns out it's free!

...and the bad news? well, that latte? you're gonna have to pay for it.

https://preview.redd.it/nf7jg5jarrwf1.png?width=432&format=png&auto=webp&s=19c7320ef4afd13696d125903f55a0ab94689721

by a margin of THREE VOTES, **breadwinner** hasn't just won bread, it's won the entire survivor! and it turns out **only as good as my god** was only as good as second place.

the entire survivor, **breadwinner** was the easy favourite - it received the least votes by a significant margin in every round, until last night, where these two songs fought tooth and nail for the winning spot. i believe i'm now in a position to call it, since the poll hasn't received any new votes for about 3 hours.

**----- ONLY AS GOOD AS MY GOD general thoughts -----**

**only as good as my god** is scratching for it's spot as my favourite **get to heaven** b-side alongside **hapsburg lippp** and **president heartbeat**. it's the perfect sweet-spot between the lyrical insanity of **hapsburg lippp**, and the more thoughtful song-writing of **president heartbeat**, so perhaps it represents the best a **get to heaven** b-side could be?

it does the magic thing **get to heaven** can do - make a phrase which is incredibly absurd into something incredibly catchy, rendering it as this hilarious, kind-of-ironic thing to repeat over and over. and *then*, after you've sung it a hundred times, you realize you've been repeating something incredibly evil. oh no!

jon all over this album approaches verses like a stand-up comedian, punch-lines after punch-lines:

>*defenestrate them all night,* ***let me grab a latte***  
*and on the steps of my church i'm chasing down a red girl with my hooves upon a wild child,*  
***i bet you didn't think of this when you woke up this morning!***

and the bizarre, SUPER CATCHY exclamations of *""i, i, i!""* and *""oo-ooh!""* and *""oo-oo-oo*"" and *""hah hah huh!""* \- these feel like pure wild violence in sonic form to me, the yells of a general to his troops, which i imagine jon would be yelling for the audience when playing this live.

in terms of drawbacks to the song, i do kind of wish this had a little more to it in the second half, after the second verse and chorus. it's enough to pull a potential 10/10 song down to maybe an 8/10 for me. for example, **blast doors** is a great song in it's first half... but that breakdown in the second half? that turns the track into a religious experience.

**----- ONLY AS GOOD AS MY GOD lyrics!! -----**

lyrically, to me this always evokes the genocide of the native americans, as much as it evokes riot police brutalizing protestors -- the first verse seems more present day with mentions of firehoses, banks, pharmacies, concrete, while the second verse seems a little more archaic with mentions of churches and hooves. i interpreted *""wild child""* and *""red girl""* as describing how european colonizers and murderers would see a young native american child (the *""red""* referring to the often-pejorative descriptor of native americans' skin-tone by european settlers), but it also evokes the hippie movement of the 50s and 60s, which associated itself with wildness and youth (and the *""red""* instead referring to her being covered by blood, perhaps).

some other indicators which make me connect this song with an earlier time of european 'enlightenment' thinking and civilisation-building is the reference to the *latte* \-- **coffee-houses** developed across europe in the 17th and 18th centuries, and were considered places seperate from a **tavern** which served alcohol - rather, people who attended coffee-houses were perceived as engaging in *intellectual debates*. they were places where european people developed ideas about the moral laws of modern living - even as the coffee and sugar crops which they consumed were being harvested by millions of enslaved people.

*defenestrate* is also an older word, most famously attached to the **1618 defenestration of prague**, a historical event where protestant radicals threw representatives of the catholic king of bohemia out of a window during a meeting, in response to increasing oppression of the religious freedom of protestant people. i think with language like this, jon is trying to weave together a whole history of violence inspired by or justified after the fact by religious belief.

>*burnt hair and more money*

there's the reference to *""more money""*, which brings to my mind the idea of **prosperity gospel** \- a fringe christian belief that God's favour for a person is tied to their financial wealth. i also think of **manifest destiny**, the imperialist belief that european settlers of north america were destined by God's will to spread across their *'newly discovered'* land. this belief attempted to justify the genocide of the native americans with absurd religious head-fuck philosophizing and white-supremacist self-aggrandizement.

anyway, that's a lot more than i meant to write about this song.... but it's very good....

**----- BREADWINNER general thoughts -----**

i think this is my favourite **everything everything** b-side -- i've realised as much as i love the weirdness of **SUPERNORMAL**, this song's intensity and cool-ness just makes it *so repeatable*. this is right between **get to heaven** and **a fever dream** for me - it's catchy, angry, dark, freaked-out, uncomfortable, addictive...

i love the way it integrates the dance music elements from **a fever dream** and alex's interest in **warp records** with the programmed piano sounds, the drum machine claps, bass and hi-hats - plus jon's vocal performances feel quite robotic to me.

>*pearl-clutcher with the heart-attack neck*  
*titanic but you end up as a wreck*

lines like that are performed by jon as if he were a spiteful computer spitting at his user, and of course:

>*power power power power power*

sounds like he's glitched out for a moment.

the live bass coming in half-way through the pre-chorus (*""hard liquor is my medicine"")* is the most hype moment in the **everything everything** discography, and the wailing guitars and vocal melody in the chorus give the song's insanity an emotional outlet. we get the *fury* in the verses, and we get the *fear* in the chorus.

**----- BREADWINNER lyrical thoughts -----**

the *pearl-clutcher with the heart-attack neck* figure being compared to the *titanic* \- if we follow on from **only as good as my god**'s exploration of european civilisation-building and it's violence towards the outsider, now we see examples of how it fails internally. the **RMS titanic** historically represents the hubris of that enlightenment mindset - the largest ship afloat at the time, an industrial marvel, sinking on it's maiden voyage, killing around 1500 people. ^(although, just a quick note that the titanic carried passengers from many different classes, however deaths were far more devestating for third class passengers - for example, 3% of first-class women died in the sinking, while 54% of third-class women died.)

some banger punch-lines:

>*9-11, 9-11, 9-11 when?*  
*so much apocalypse you're finding it a bore*  
*they prayed for murder but you prayed a little more*  
*one flat earth, they were right, they were right*  
*palpitations of the belly on the barbercue*  
*walk into the wall like you're an NPC*  
*hard liquor for my birthday cak*e

i *really* like the one about *flat earths* \- there's something profoundly deranged about it. the character doesn't seem to believe in the actual flat earth theory, but can sense a deeper truth in it. what does it mean that *this* person thinks the earth is flat? i get the impression it means they see the world as unsymbolic, as without spiritual value. there's no meaning whatsoever, it's all just consumption and survival and capital.

we can see that idea throughout the lyrics - absurd collages of words and ideas: *marimba rights* rather than *miranda rights*, boredom and apocalypse, prayer and murder, liquor and birthday cake -- all these things lose their old meanings and are replaced by a single directive - *power power power power power.*

there's definitely a commentary of masculinity and patriarchy happening here. the song is called **breadwinner** and the pre-chorus describes an archetypal 'father figure' who drinks 'hard liquor' [(shout out to taylor swift and the best song on her new and not-very-good album)](https://genius.com/37115332) on his birthday... and also whenever he doesn't feel too good (it's his *medicine*).

this father figure seems to falling apart a little - perhaps the bridge is the character realizing they don't run this world at all, and they've fallen for a long-con. they've become the patriarch, terrifying to their family -- what did they gain but the tiniest sliver of power, the loss of all human connection.

this tension between the power and powerlessness of this figure also gets emphasized in this line:

>*you ate the crayon cos you thought that it was free*

initially i connected this line to the simpsons joke about [homer sticking a crayon up his nose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FNptHqAlgwM), therefore connecting this song to the sitcom archetype of the clueless father (*you've gotta be kidding me!)* \- but it turns out there was an early-2010s meme about [crayon-eating marines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crayon-eating_Marine_trope). the older joke of the unintelligent marine eating crayons and drinking glue was taken on and popularized by marines in the internet age, embracing it as an inside-joke, which i think is sweet. given when the song was released, and how much time jon spends on his computer, i assume that's what this line is referencing.

that this figure will eat the crayon *because they thought it was free* is interesting - they have a tendency for consumption and getting *value for money*, only to discover later that they'll actually have to pay for it. they've fallen for a con where they don't benefit initially (crayons aren't actually good for you), nor do they benefit long-term (they'll have to pay for it). it's all a big trick, and now they've got to live with the devil.

>*you've got to be kidding me...*  
*now i see you're not*

these are tragic figures, even if they're usually the bad guy in most stories, and the tangle of inherited traits we associate with masculinity allow us to re-enact these toxic dramas generation after generation. they aren't separate from us, we are them, we let them in (or they force their way in, actually).

this song releasing alongside **the mariana** is intentional. both songs try to look from the perspective of male authority figures, one song looking with empathy for those lost and suffering in that role and the other song examining the tyrannical egotism of those who are... also lost and suffering in that role. i think that's really neat, it's a great and artistic choice which is worthy of a deeper look, someday.

anyway!

**----- OVERALL -----**

the b-sides survivor is over! thanks for taking part everyone! this was really great. i was a little sad to see less engagement overall, but i think that's to be expected for b-sides.

There was no slamming of doors, no fighting and yells echoing in the halls, no final crescendo that signalled the end of us. It was a quiet question, ""what's going on?"" And a face that hardened for a moment, then went soft and slack. It was no accusation, but plea for an explanation as to why the warmth had been rescinded and a hope that would return. A hope that would go unanswered. 

In the early morning, I gathered some of my things and trekked into the dark before the sun had yet risen. The greatest experience of my life, the gift of understanding what love truly was, snuffed out gently as one might blow out a candle when leaving the room. Blueprints for a future that I will never see scrapped right when I prepared to break ground. Heists of goats, a cottage in the woods, an infinite library, and an endless flow of coffee, erased from existence.

You see, I had a demon that had been whispering in my ear for the better part of the decade. It was in plain sight to me, but she had looked past it until there was nowhere else to look. Confronted with the reality that I was not the person that she had constructed in her mind's eye, my flaws laid bare under her gaze, she recoiled. Her stomach turned and she could not reconcile how she had once felt with the thing that had been sleeping next to her.

Wracked with guilt and blame towards myself, I finally cast this demon off my shoulders in a fit of rage. Its whispers had cost me everything and gave nothing but hollowness and pain in return. 

I begged the only person in this cold world that I would ever allow myself to beg for anything for an opportunity to mend these shattered pieces, and she thought for a long while.

Bingo orders, “a cup of cocoa, cold veal and ham pie, a slice of fruitcake, and a macaroon”, and asks Bertie if he wants the same thing.

Bertie says that he is ‘revolted’ at the suggestion, and goes on to say of Bingo: “That he could have been a pal of mine all these years and think me capable of insulting the old tum with this sort of stuff cut me to the quick”.

To me this sounds like an acceptable meal, and I was surprised to hear that Bertie didn’t want it - especially because in the text he doesn’t discuss what he would have preferred. Bingo also suggests steak pudding with a ‘sparkling lime-ade-o to wash it down’, but Bertie doesn’t like the sound of that either, and eventually deems a roll with butter and a small coffee the only acceptable menu option.

Were these foods typical of restaurants in London in the early 1920s? It appears that Bertie and Bingo are dining at a less formal/cheaper establishment - is that reflected in the food that is made available to them? What kind of foods would have been considered more acceptable/desirable to a gentleman like Bertie?",1,1761191010.0,AskHistorians,1,1.0,False

I remember growing up my Grandma, his mom, and her sister having dementia and some kind of Alzheimer's and how hard it was to take care of them. My dad is showing signs now. He is getting aggressive, imagine things, paranoia , and  forget easily. No formal diagnosis yet

I live 6 hours away and can't find a job close to them. I tried bringing my dad with me. But it was really hard. I work full time and the town  live is very small and no activities so I can't entertain him. 
part of problem he has difficulty walking and is staying home a lot.I think he has depression too . There is no one to engage with since even my family there is preoccupied with work and personal life. 
I really feal guilty and try to whenever i visit to take him out. But he has no hobbies or activities he likes so i just take him to coffee shop. 
My culture doesn't take mental health seriously and also parents are taken care by kids till they leave . So no nursing home or anything.

I am selfish and already stressed as hell at work so taking care of aging parents isn't something I wanna do but i will do it if i have to. I feel really guilty about that.  it is the reason why i decided to never have kids so i don't burden anyone. 

My first question is how do i gety dad to to go to therapist/psychiatrist to take care of his mental health? He is on medicine for other health issues and he is very non compliant. So that's another issue

Its clear I've reached my limit and its time for an *extended breather.


My questions.

1.Do LOA requests generally get approved for mental health related reasons? If so, what is the burden of proof on my end?

2. About how many weeks does a LOA last? 

3. What kind of job security am I looking at during the LOA period?

4. If I have 200 hours of leave stored can they be used during the LOA period so I can continue having steady income for my family? 

5. While on a LOA do I maintain my normal full-time health, dental, and vision benefits?

**Core Drive/Motivation:**

Veronique DeBois is a skirt in a man’s racket, and worse—she’s a looker. Blonde, built, and just short of five feet tall, she’s got the kind of face that makes men forget she’s packing a sharper mind than most of them. But she’s not chasing compliments. She’s chasing something harder to catch: respect.

Her old man, Harvard “Harvy” Melvin DeBois, was a legend in this town—took a bullet intended for Roosevelt climbing San Juan Hill. A war hero turned gumshoe with a knack for solving the unsolvable and a habit of leaving debts in his wake. Folks still speak his name like it’s carved in marble, but they don’t speak hers at all. Not unless it’s with a smirk or a sigh.

She knows the odds. A dame trying to fill a man’s shoes is already a long shot. A beautiful dame trying to live up to a dead legend? That’s a sucker’s bet. But Veronique plays it anyway. Not for glory. Not for headlines. Just for the chance to prove that she’s more than a pretty face in a city that eats girls like her for breakfast.

She wants to be taken seriously. She wants her name to mean something. And she’s willing to bleed for it.

If someone asks what she’s after, maybe she says:

“I ain’t lookin’ to be liked, cher. I’m lookin’ to be remembered—and not just for the way I walk.”

# Origin: 

*French Quarter, New Orleans — 1932*

She was born in a thunderstorm that split the sky like a pistol shot—one of those nights that made old men drink early and old women light candles in the corners of their kitchens. She spoke Creole before she spoke English, raised by music and women who lit candles when the thunder came. Harvy didn’t know her until she was six—and by then, she already knew how to disappear. Her mother, Celestine Thibodeaux DeBois, was a Creole torch singer with a voice like smoke and honey—sweet enough to hush a crowd, sultry enough to start a riot. She sang in French and Creole at the *Maison Verte*, where the bourbon was cheap and the heartbreak was real. Men came for the music, but they stayed for her. Harvy DeBois was one of them—a decorated Rough Rider with a limp and a legend, fresh off a case and halfway drunk on her voice.

They married fast, loved hard, and tried to build something lasting. But Celestine died in childbirth, trying to bring a son into the world who never drew breath. Veronique was six and Havy was just back from the war. His second one, the one they called the great war. The silence that followed never quite left the house.He tried to be a father, but grief made him a ghost. Veronique learned to read silence like a case file.

Harvy was brilliant. He solved cases that made headlines and enemies—kidnappings, political blackmail, murders that left the city gasping. He was the kind of man who could read a lie in the way someone stirred their coffee. But he was also reckless. He spent money like it was borrowed time, mortgaged everything he touched, and left behind a legacy too heavy for a child to carry. When he died—gunshot, scandal, or sickness, depending on who you ask—the creditors came like crows. The townhouse was sold. The car was taken. The name *DeBois*, once spoken with reverence, became a whisper of pity.

Veronique was six when her mother died, nineteen when her father followed. She didn’t inherit the townhouse or the car. Just the name, the debts, and a trunk full of ghosts. She keeps her mama’s last song folded in a drawer, the paper yellowed, the ink still defiant. She lives now in a studio apartment above a bakery that smells of burnt sugar and regret. The bathroom’s down the hall, shared with a jazz singer, a retired priest, and a woman who claims to be a duchess. Her room is barely wide enough for a bed, a desk, and the ghosts of better days. She eats when the work pays, sleeps when the ghosts get tired, and works as a private detective in a city that doesn’t believe women belong in that line of work—especially not women with blonde hair, Creole blood, and a voice that doesn’t flinch.

She’s 4’11"" of bad luck and brass, and she walks like the sidewalk owes her rent.She wears lace gloves with holes in the fingertips, boots that remember better days, and a coat that used to hang on her father’s shoulders. She speaks Creole like a lullaby and swears in French when the bourbon bites. It gets her into places no badge ever could. She takes the cases that stink of blood and silence—the kind that make men drink early and sleep light: missing girls, crooked landlords, secrets buried in churchyards. She’s not in it for glory. She’s in it because the city is broken, and someone has to look it in the eye.

She’s not her father. She’s what’s left when the legend dies and the bills come due. She’s the echo of a name, the last candle in a dark room, and the kind of woman who solves mysteries not because she wants to—but because she *has to*.

If someone asks who she is, maybe she says:

“I’m Veronique DeBois. My daddy was a legend, my mama was a saint, and I’m the girl who stayed when the lights went out.”

# When someone questions her legacy:

*“Harvy DeBois was the kind of man they put in the papers. I’m the one they forgot to write about.”*

If she is talking about her mama she would say:

“She lit up the room, cher. And when she left, it took years for the shadows to settle.”

# Personality: 

Veronique DeBois is plucky as a stray cat and twice as stubborn. She’s got the brains to crack a case wide open and the backbone to stare down a city full of crooks, coppers, and creeps. If she were a man, they’d call her hard-boiled and hand her a badge. If she looked like a stern schoolmarm with a jaw like a brick wall, they might at least shut up and listen. But she’s a knockout—blonde, built, and easy on the eyes—and that’s the rub. Folks see the curves before the credentials, and they mistake her lipstick for weakness. Big mistake. She’s got a mind like a switchblade and a stare that could freeze gin. She doesn’t bark, she doesn’t bluff—she just gets the job done, one lie at a time.

If someone tries to underestimate her, maybe she says:

“Keep lookin’ at my legs, cher. I’ll solve the case while you’re still countin’ seams.”

# Physical Appearance: 

She stands just shy of five feet, but carried herself like she owned the sidewalk. Blonde hair fell in soft waves past her shoulders, the kind of gold that caught gaslight and made men forget their manners. She had a figure that turned heads and tightened collars—curves like a saxophone solo, smooth and dangerous. Her legs weren’t long, but they knew how to walk away from trouble and toward answers. In a city full of shadows, Veronique DeBois was the kind of dame who made you look twice—and regret it the third time.

If someone described her in hushed tones over a whiskey glass, maybe they’d say:

“She’s built like a promise and walks like she’s late to break it.”

Big glossy coffee table art books were out of the question, and those are what I wanted to scan the most

However, I refused to give up, and discovered that while the czur scanning program wont initialize its camera if you change the default windows camera settings, there are third party webcam control programs you can download, that allow you to monkey with the video parameters and kill the ridiculous sharpness levels they have cranked all the way up.

Finally, progress! We don't want this crazy post processing, we bought these dumb things because it's a camera with lasers that correct the curvature of the pages, thats all. It's a good idea! It works! I got a big sheet of plexiglass to hold the pages down with so I could avoid using the fingercots that their software doesn't really blur out. The lasers don't bounce off the plexiglass and it correctly reads the slope of the books.

Disabling the sharpness and capturing in no-filter mode, by and large is everything I hoped for. I'm still working on solving the lighting to be uniform across the whole document, but that seems like it should be an easy enough fix. With black and white comics and manga, some of the ink will appear washed out or even blue and purple but I suspect thats due to the lighting and at any rate can be fixed in post, with extra work.

However, now my primary issue is, as pictured above, certain combinations of paper grain and glossy ink cause a distinct rainbow moire effect that I can't fix with sliders or moving the lights around or tilting or raising the books or anything. It's driving me nuts. I'm so close to getting that functioning book scanner I paid for. Photoshop has a tool that partially mitigates the moire effect but it just desaturates it and if its on a blank background like in this ikebana painting attached, it leaves grey zebra stripes across the image.

I don't expect anyone has any solutions now, but if you are a traveller from the future who comes across this post and figured out whats causing the moire and how to stop it, please, let us all know :o :o :o",1,1761190505.0,CZUR,0,1.0,False

**I’m writing this because I’m genuinely heartbroken.**

We used to work together in a government hospital. We are coworkers. She’s from a *'kathmandu community'* family, and I’m from Terai. She’s honestly one of the prettiest girls I’ve ever seen. Pretty not just by her face, but her whole vibe and personality. And me, well… I look okayish, a bit on the heavier side, but fair. But I am confident by my looks, just need some workout to bring the best of me, I guess. Still, she never made me feel less. Her voice is so good man, it’s so soothing, like it could literally bring peace to wars.

This all started around 5–6 months back. One day I randomly asked her out for coffee, and she said yes. From there, we started going out often, usually on weekends. **Slowly it became a habit.** It was something I’d look forward to more than anything. I used to skip study time, push my other stuff aside just to be with her. To an extent, at times I have jeopardized certain career related things. But I never regretted it, not even once. I don't even regret it now. Because those moments felt pure. It felt right.

Over time, my feelings got deeper. I actually started thinking long-term about us like marriage and all that. She seemed okay with it too, and that gave me confidence. I had even started to plan how to tell my parents. I **asked if her parents would be fine with intercaste marriage, and she said yes.** That meant a lot, because I’ve always heard that in Kathmandu, especially among  '*kathmandu community*' , inter-community things rarely get accepted.

But then Dashain came… and she started acting a bit off. Didn’t give me much time. I felt bad but tried to understand. After Dashain, things looked okay again, **I thought maybe everything was back to normal.** But now, since the last 3–4 days, she just stopped replying. No message, no nothing. I kept checking my phone every 30 minutes like a fool, hoping maybe she texted. It got to a point where I couldn’t take it anymore and I had to deactivate all my social media just to stop myself from checking or end up sending her any frustrated texts.

Now I’m home, and it’s Tihar and Chhath which is the biggest festivals for us, but I’m not even able to enjoy anything. Everyone’s happy, lights everywhere, but I just feel empty. I had imagined so much with her, thought of a future together, and suddenly it’s all gone.

I’m not mad at her. She’s genuinely a nice person, one of the sweetest I’ve known. I don’t want to say anything bad or make her feel guilty. I’ve always given her space, respected her decisions. But this silence… it’s killing me., eating me up from inside.

I am posting here in view that I would get answers from you guys.  
I just don’t understand why. **Why she suddenly went cold.**  
**Did I do something wrong?** Did I love too much?  
Or was I just a phase for her?

I don’t know.

Totally fine if it’s a little off campus or a short drive away — I’m just hoping for something fun or cozy to do that fits the Halloween vibe.

However, I've never been to the Shanghai store, and nowhere online have I seen the white mugs in this style - only the tall tumbler and the slate grey mugs.

Does anyone know if the Shanghai version exists (or existed)? or if the new Taipei store has them, or if, by chance, any other reserve locations have this style mug? (For instance, the Honolulu reserve store wasn't ever an official roastery, but somehow got  the HNL mug variant).

These are my infinity stones, I must complete the collection.",5,1761189950.0,starbucks,0,1.0,False

I have a Chemex, love brands like Atomic Coffee. This is easily my preferred coffee drinking method. Love their medium, and light/blonde roasts. Sometimes though with work, I have to just slam out a cup and sweeten it with flavored creamer of choice. Mount Hagen has been my go to instant coffee in this scenario. However, lately, especially with tariffs they are just far far to expensive at this point for instant coffee. Over the years they went from me buying a case of 12 for $95 - $97, now a case of 12 is $125 - $152. I remember even cases of 6 would go on sale as low as $30 pre pandemic.

So TL:DR what is the best instant coffee in terms of quality that you have had that isn't the price of Mount Hagen

1odsqp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/BPDlovedones/comments/1odsqp9/quietimpulsive_bdp_ex_monkey_branch/,Quiet/Impulsive BDP ex Monkey Branch,"This is the equivalent of me journaling our entire relationship to get it all out one last time. We’re 2 and a half months removed and I’m doing a lot better, but man was it brutal. I’m 26(M) she just turned 22(F) for context.
 
We met how everyone first meets a pw/BDP, her complaining about her relationship. How no one ever treats her right🚩 and for a while I’d just listen to her genuinely not interested what so ever. Everyone said she was crazy and I believed them. But she sunk her teeth in me. I knew about one of her exs not a great dude much older and the one she actively complained to me about seems to actually be a half decent guy looking back on it but had boundaries and wanted to take things slowly which as well all know don’t go over well for BDPs. Her and I were working together but not in the same department, I knew she was leaving the company soon so I didn’t have a problem starting to see her.

We went on a date and hung out a few days later. It was just how you all imagine your starts, fireworks. Ignoring red flags everywhere we were inseparable from the jump. With all the rapport I thought we built up at work and the first few dates the soul mate talk and I love yous started flying within the first month or 2🚩 .

I was new to her small town and come from a little bit of money and am fairly successful in my own right. She came from a broken family and didn’t have much going on for her. This isn’t really important now but will come up later. We would go out all the time, constantly seeing each other making plans supporting her new career she was just starting we really became a true couple within weeks/months. I was the first guy she brought around her friends, first guy she ever introduced to her dad and I genuinely do believe this phase of idealization was different even for her. She thought she was building her first real adult relationship. 

About 4/5 months in I flew across the country with her to stay with and meet my family. It was an unbelievable 10 days surrounded by a lifestyle she was not used to. Nothing crazy but solid family dynamics and friends that created as she told me “the best nights of her life” took her ice skating on the beach, karaoke with friends nights out on the town she was in dreamland and so was I. One of the last nights of the trip my brother cousin and I wanted to go to a food place and I asked if she wanted to come she said no that we should enjoy our time together but when I got back she was already in bed telling my family she didn’t feel well. I immediately went back there to check on her and she was crying, very upset. She was upset that I left her, that I’d leave her alone at the house even though she told me to go on my own🚩. I got her coffee in the morning surprised her with it and we were all good, catastrophe avoided… for now.

We come back home everything is going well the next few months except for one small problem. Her new career she had started about 7-8 months back now was failing, miserably. See she had started it off at a start up business with a boss that had never managed let  alone ran her own business before and let’s just say both of their work ethics left something to be desired. With that being said her finances were being drained quickly. Not making hardly any money with bills to pay the stress ended up mounting the next few months. 

Our first fight, and I mean ever, and it wasn’t even really a fight came around the 10 month mark. I had raised my voice in annoyance in how lazy she was about doing something for me because it inconvenienced her and she cried for hours and hours about it. Later telling me she was devastated I would treat her like that saying “that’s not ____” 🚩however this wasn’t where the split truly happened. 

Everything continued as normal the next few weeks except I was now supporting her heavily financially. She was running out of money and I was working harder than ever as it was busy season. She wanted to go on a date with me her friend and her friends BF. I told her maybe but after I got home from work I was exhausted I asked if it was okay if I didn’t go and she said that was fine and that she understood. 
WRONG.   She was devastated this hammered her fear of abandonment she cried and raged to me after asking her what’s wrong I thought she said she was okay with me not going she exclaimed “well maybe the next person tells you that just go anyway!”🚩🚩🚩
This was the moment I was split fully but I wasn’t aware of it yet.

We talked about it and got passed it, so I thought. She said she had calmed down and “was seeing things differently now”🧐
But the tone in our conversations never fully bounced back to what they were before that missed date. Maybe a week later she broke down saying she wasn’t feeling the same about us anymore. Balling her eyes out she asked why I’d ever want to date someone like her. How could someone do as much as I did for her and ever want to put up with her. I assured her she was everything I wanted and it’s okay. I asked why she thought she was feeling this way all of a sudden. She said how she didn’t feel we did enough fun dates we didn’t do anything romantic. Which to be completely honest I did find that criticism fair so I stepped it up. 

The next day I took her to our favorite city close by got her some drinks had some fun and had a great day together. 1 week later she was packing to go on a girls trip when her cat got out while she was getting her stuff ready. It almost died. I had to save its life and stayed with her in the animal ER all night until 8am when I had work at 10. This was traumatic for her she couldn’t go on her trip anymore so what did I do? I planned a trip to see my family with her in a month spend a week at the beach with her and a trip to New York for her birthday 3 weeks after that. We never made it to either trip.

About a week after that she went out with her friends to a bar gave a new guy she would end up monkey branching to her snap chat vetted him to make sure he was interested enough for something serious and discarded me a week before our anniversary and our trip to the beach. While I was on that trip by myself she posted him to her story. I was devastated. How could the girl that talked about forever with me less than a month ago. That talked about growing old together just weeks prior be so in love and with someone new like it was nothing out of the most serious relationship of her life. Her friends reached out to console me, they knew what I did for her. Her family reached out numerous times to apologize on her behalf. It didn’t matter to me I felt betrayed like I was living a nightmare everyday. I didn’t even know what BPD was until post break up.

At the end of the day it doesn’t matter I will grow from this experience I will move on I will find a healthy stable secure love and she will live in this cycle most likely for the rest of her life. I’m more than anything grateful our idealization phase was brought to a screeching halt by her failing career and my one missed date otherwise who knows where I would’ve been in life with this girl when she’d inevitably do this. Would we have been living together? Married? God forbid children were involved and if they were with you I’m so sorry and I wish you the most strength. I never had to really go through the push/pull cycling of idealization devaluation over and over again I just experienced one long idealization and a sudden discard after one intense week and a half of devaluation criticism and outright disrespect before she cut the chord on us. Which looking back on I’m thankful for. I’m thankful for the new guy for taking her off my hands. The sad part for them now is her life was stabilized by me. I got her a second job, I got her cat healthy. And I doubt a perfect storm of those situations will cut him loose of her cycles once the idealization inevitably comes to an end and who knows where they will be when that happens. But you can wait tables and cut hair for a while on a half decent enough income to not feel the external pressure she felt with me. Best of luck to all of you guys out there going through something.

1odso5h,https://www.reddit.com/r/TrueOffMyChest/comments/1odso5h/im_at_the_end_of_my_rope_with_my_roommate/,I’m at the end of my rope with my roommate,"I posted on another subreddit earlier about not wanting my roommate to use the kitchen fridge but the garage one instead, but I left so much out and I just need to vent at this point.

I needed a roommate after going through a breakup and living alone for the first time in 9 years. My parents own the house I live in, and although the rent isn’t high, I can’t afford it on my own. I’ve been here for 7 years, so this is my fully furnished home. The economy is brutal and I just couldn’t make ends meet by myself. So an acquaintance needed a place to rent, so I suggested she come take a look. I told her I would rent her a bedroom upstairs, that has a closet. She came, checked it out, and said it was good and was happy about the space. She has a small dog, nothing in particular was disclosed to me about him, but he got along with my two cats and dog. I’m renting the room lower than the market prices.

Move in day she showed up with two full to the brim U-Haul trucks. Enough things to furnish an entire house. Couch, workout machines, multiple tvs, almost an entire U-Haul of construction equipment etc. I wasn’t privy to this beforehand. I’m renting her a room. The entire garage got filled up (unusable to put my car in anymore), the basement that was a rec room got completely filled as well as the laundry room that looked more like a storage unit. Her dog started peeing and pooping in the basement on the carpet on night one, and it never stopped. She tried putting pee pads but he would still pee and poop on the carpet. She doesn’t take him out enough if at all so this behaviour can’t stop. I told her this wasn’t livable and the rec room (entire basement) wasn’t usable because of it. She said she would train him not to, but that never happened. She left poop streaks in the toilet, chunks of toothpaste in the sink, coffee stains on the counters etc. I spent months being patient. I asked her to sort through her things or get a storage unit, help around the house in the common areas to maintain cleanliness, organize the basement and garage and laundry room, do something about the dog poop and dog who barks at the wind all day long and I work from home. I got really really fed up and tired.

I asked her to move into the basement, a fully private, much bigger space than her room upstairs (practically a whole floor of the house), and have all her things moved in there. I even split the cost of a shed to put in the backyard to store some of her construction tools (she doesn’t work in construction, just has those things), to declutter the garage so I can use it for my car as previously agreed upon. I couldn’t live with the sight of the dog poop anymore. She also now has exclusive use of the ground floor bathroom, and I use the top floor bathroom. She wasn’t happy, but eventually agreed after weeks of negotiation. Things are better, although the garage and laundry room are still cluttered and she keeps adding things.

So about the fridge. When she moved in, the fridge that was in the house was too small for two people eating different foods. I wanted our living situation to be comfortable for the both of us so I bought a second hand fridge and put it in the kitchen to replace the old one. We moved the old one in the garage right next door to the kitchen for extra storage. It was easier with this new fridge in the kitchen, we split it half half, although I was the only one cleaning it and she would keep putting some of her things on my side. It broke recently, and I was faced with having to find a new solution. I tried buying parts for it, repairing it myself to save money, but it was done done. She didn’t help or offer and solutions whatsoever. We’ve been sharing the garage fridge since.

So I decided to bite the bullet and buy a new fridge to make sure it lasts more than 8 months like the previous one I bought. I looked for one I could afford and would fit both our needs, but damn they’re expensive. I ended up settling on one, but through this process I started thinking that maybe I should think of my needs first. The older working fridge located in the garage is great, works fine, and since I’m the one spending 2400$ for this new one, that maybe I should be the one enjoying it and using it. I work three jobs to make ends meet, and this amount of money is a big deal for me. I’m just so over trying to make her happy and letting her take advantage of my kindness.

So I asked her to use the garage fridge tonight saying it would be better if we had our own fridges and she trampled all over me saying that that wasn’t convenient for her and needs space in my new fridge. Mind you she also has another fridge of her own in the basement. So maybe that was not a cool move on my end, but I’m tired, Reddit.",1,1761189398.0,TrueOffMyChest,0,1.0,False

They say sleep is the safest place on Earth — a private darkness where nothing can touch you.  
That’s a lie.

Sleep is not rest. It’s a door.

When we dream, our minds wander, but our bodies stay behind — empty houses waiting for something to come home. Every night, billions of us slip into paralysis and hope that whatever visits, whatever watches, will leave when morning comes.

Doctors call it “sleep paralysis.”  
Spiritualists call it “crossing the veil.”  
The truth is probably worse than both.

The case I’m about to share came from a missing person’s file that was quietly closed in 1991.  
The investigator’s name was **Abby Dubberlan**, a sleep technician and young mother who took on an unusual home visit in rural Oklahoma. The report was never officially submitted. Instead, her handwritten notes were found in a bloodstained notebook beside a child’s toy.

The toy’s brand and model don’t exist in any catalog.

What follows is her *unedited field log*, transcribed from recovered pages. The original handwriting becomes erratic near the end. Investigators marked several time stamps where they believe she was interrupted.

Read it if you want.  
But if you do — **don’t fall asleep tonight.**



Field Log — June 6, 1991

**Subject:** Drake ██████  
**Observer:** Abby Dubberlan  
**Location:** █████ County, Oklahoma



When I first met Drake, he came across as your typical six-year-old boy.  
Sweet. Shy. Polite.  
The kind of child who folds his napkin and says “thank you” for a glass of water.

Nothing stood out as odd — except how quiet the house felt.

His mother, Sarah, looked exhausted. There were deep shadows under her eyes, the kind that don’t come from a bad night’s sleep but from *too many* of them. She said Drake’s episodes began shortly after they moved here, after... what she called *the incident* with his father. She wouldn’t elaborate.

The house itself was small — two bedrooms, one bath, but it felt wrong somehow. No clocks ticking. No hum from the fridge. Just the steady creak of wood, like it was breathing along with us.

Every wall had crosses or scripture verses pinned to it.  
When I asked if she was religious, she told me *no.*  
Said they “just help keep things quiet.”

That’s when I started noticing the locks — not on the *outside* doors, but on **Drake’s bedroom door.** Heavy, metal, bolted from the hallway side. His window had burglar bars that didn’t match the frame.

She said it was to “keep him safe while he sleeps.”

I tried to laugh. She didn’t.

Drake followed me through the house with a toy clutched to his chest — a plastic werewolf missing one eye. He called it *Fred.* Every room we entered, he introduced Fred like a guest.

“This is where we fix bodies for Fred to eat. Yum!”

He said it sweetly, almost singing, his small hand rubbing his belly.  
Sarah didn’t even flinch. She’d heard it before.

Something about the way that toy stared at me — always facing my direction, even when I didn’t remember turning it — left a cold pressure behind my eyes.

I told myself it was just nerves.  
It wasn’t.



**Time:** 7:13 PM  
**Conditions:** Calm. Clear.  
**Temperature:** 73°F indoors — dropping.



Sarah was called into her night shift sooner than expected. She hesitated at the door, keys trembling in her hand.

“Lock him in if you need to,” she whispered. “You’ll understand.”

Her eyes didn’t meet mine.  
Then she left.

It was just me, Drake… and Fred.



**7:45 PM**  
Drake was surprisingly obedient — brushed his teeth, cleaned up after dinner, and even said grace on his own. He didn’t speak much, except to the toy.

“Fred’s tired. But not sleepy yet.”

His voice had that strange matter-of-factness that children use when they don’t realize they’re saying something impossible.

I noted that the air was colder near his chair than anywhere else in the room. Could’ve been a vent.  
Could’ve been.



**8:32 PM**  
We talked while the TV murmured. I asked about his dreams.  
He said sometimes they were “movies that never end.”

“They start nice,” he said, “but then they get stuck.”  
“Stuck?”  
“Like… the people can’t wake up, so they keep screaming.”

When he mentioned “the monster that looks like Daddy,” his tone shifted from fear to familiarity — like he’d accepted it. Like it visited often.

I tried to steer the conversation toward his toy, to see if “Fred” was an extension of that trauma.

“Fred came from there,” he said simply. “From the dream place.”

His gaze didn’t break.  
Neither did Fred’s.



**9:00 PM**  
Bedtime.  
Sarah’s written note said **“No exceptions.”**

Drake begged to stay up for a horror special at 10.  
I shouldn’t have agreed, but his smile was bright enough to make me forget every warning I’d just heard.

He curled up on the couch, toy in hand. Static flickered on the old TV screen. The picture stabilized into a cheaply made werewolf film — exactly what I didn’t need before a long night.



**10:07 PM**  
Drake was transfixed.  
Fred sat upright beside him on the coffee table, its one glassy eye catching the screen’s light.

Every so often, I could swear the toy had turned slightly — just enough that I could see its teeth.

I blinked and it was still again.

I told myself to relax. Imagination. Lighting. Pareidolia.  
Still, I made a note: *Possible RBD onset approaching — minor tremors in subject’s fingers.*



**10:43 PM**  
Drake fell asleep mid-scene. The TV kept playing.  
When I bent to lift him, the temperature dropped — a sharp, visible mist when I exhaled.

The channel glitched. For half a second, the screen showed what looked like a dark hallway, not part of the film.

Then static.

Then nothing.

I reached for the remote. That’s when I heard it.

A wet, slow **gurgle** — behind me.

The sound of something breathing wrong.

“Drake?”

No answer.

Dark, squiggling shadows pooled around his body like ink bleeding through the carpet.

When I turned back toward the coffee table—

Fred was gone.



**10:51 PM**  
My arms prickled with cold. The air hummed — a low, electrical tone you don’t hear so much as *feel* in your teeth.

I tried to move Drake, but he was impossibly heavy — not limp, not rigid, just wrong. Like gravity was thicker around him.

“Drake, wake up.”  
“Drake!”

His eyes snapped open all at once.

“Is the movie over?”

I nearly cried with relief.

He smiled, sleepy but calm.

“You stopped it too soon,” he murmured. “Fred was almost done.”



**11:00 PM**  
He wanted to keep watching. I gave him five more minutes. I shouldn’t have.

He stared blankly at the screen until it ended. Then he turned to me, still holding the toy.

“You were wrong,” he said softly. “The monster lived.”  
“It’s just a story, sweetheart.”  
“No,” he said. “It’s a dream. And it’s still hungry.”

For a moment, I thought about my daughter back home. She’d be curled up under her pink blanket, safe, breathing softly. I promised I’d call before midnight. I should’ve called by now.

  
**11:26 PM**

Drake’s asleep again.  
At least, I think he is.

His breathing doesn’t sound right — too slow, too… *thick.* Every inhale rattles like there’s someone else inside his lungs trying to get out. I tried waking him once more, but his eyes rolled under their lids like they were tracking movement only he could see.

Fred’s back on the floor, lying face-up toward the ceiling.  
The toy’s mouth is open wider than before. I checked — the plastic doesn’t bend like that.

I should have left an hour ago.  
But I promised Sarah I’d watch him through the night.



**11:52 PM**  
Temperature’s dropping again — I can see my breath. The walls are making a sound like… chewing. A damp, pulpy sound that moves in circles around the room.

I heard the locks on Drake’s door *click* on their own.

I swear to God, I didn’t touch them.

The refrigerator hummed for a moment, then stopped mid-cycle. The house went completely still. Even the crickets outside went silent, as if something larger had just arrived. The air smells metallic — like coins and old blood. The light bulb keeps flickering, and every time it goes out, I see a shape standing where Drake’s shadow should be. It bends when he doesn’t.

The wall clock read 11:12. When I blinked, it said 12:17. My wristwatch still said 11:12.



**12:07 AM**  
Something just whispered behind me.  
Sounded like *me.*  
Same voice.  
Same words I’m writing.

I dropped my pen, but when I picked it up again, there was handwriting already there — my handwriting — words I didn’t write:

“Stop waking him. He’s dreaming of you now.”

I want to scream but I can’t. The sound gets swallowed before it leaves my throat. The room eats noise.



**12:10 AM**  
He’s standing up.

Not walking.  
Just… standing.

His eyes are open, but they’re too dark, like the pupils swallowed everything else.

“Drake,” I said.  
No answer.

He turned his head slow, like it hurt. The smile that followed wasn’t his.

For a heartbeat, I saw my reflection move behind his eyes — not as a trick of light, but as if something had replaced him with me.

“Fred’s done playing,” he said. “It’s your turn now.”

Then he started laughing — a bubbling, breathless laugh that didn’t match the shape of his mouth.

I’m hiding under the desk. I don’t know what’s happening to him.  
Something’s wrong with the walls — they’re *moving.*  
Breathing.



**12:16 AM**  
If anyone finds this—

I’m tired, but wide awake.

I can hear him inside the walls, humming through my hands as I write.

If anyone finds this— the sound— it’s learning how to use my voice to travel.  
It’s finishing my thoughts before I do.

It’s colder now.  
Everything smells like pennies and wet fur.

Something’s scratching at the door — not to get in, but to keep something *in here with me.*

Drake’s humming.  
He doesn’t blink.

The shadows are longer now.  
They look like *hands.*

He’s walking toward me.

He’s whispering something.

It sounds like—

*(line trails off in ink and pressure marks)*



Post-Incident Summary (Extracted from police file #06-1991)

When investigators entered the residence two days later, they found no trace of Abby Dubberlan or the child known as “Drake.” The house showed signs of internal damage consistent with violent struggle — deep gouges in wood and plaster, originating from inside the locked bedroom.

The floorboards beneath the bed were warped by heat, though no fire occurred.

A melted wristwatch was recovered from the desk area, hands stopped at **12:17 AM.**

On the wall above the bed, written backward in soot and graphite:

“Don’t wake him.”

A single toy was discovered on the floor nearby.

It was not a werewolf.



**Editor’s Note (Recovered 2025)**

In 2004, a figure matching the toy’s description was reportedly found at a thrift store fire in Tulsa. The store’s CCTV footage froze at 12:17 AM — same as Abby’s watch.

We actually broke up twice— once about a month ago: I got jealous when I saw that he was messaging a girl he used to like (who he knows i do not like because she is overly friendly with other guys) and he was telling her a lengthy story about an old crush he used to have, ended it with “thanks for listening to my love story” and “goodnight.” I ended it after coming back home but that was the final straw for me tbh because near the end of it all I honestly felt like I wasn’t really any sort of priority to him (ik i shouldn’t be like above his mom or something but still lol) and i just felt desperate. Unfortunately I did get desperate… and i begged for him to come back like four hours later at midnight. He told he thought the relationship was draining and even though he loved me he said it would be better off if we didn’t date again. Well… I begged again and he basically put me on “hold” for two weeks to think about it before taking me back again. I’ll admit that I am an insecure person and my gut wouldn’t stop telling to to check his phone for messages between him and that girl. I found out that they were messaging each other (i’ll admit it wasn’t like full on flirty but it was weird) like he would get nostalgic saying “i remember when i used to make coffee for you” and what broke me even more was finding out that she was clinging on to him when they went out with friends to a pumpkin patch literally the day before we got together again. Wether or not he cheated I honestly couldn’t regain the same trust back with him and I decided to officially let it go. It’s been hurting me a lot lately and I just want to use this as a chance to gain confidence and reconnect with people. Any advice would be appreciated",0,1761189045.0,AskTeenGirls,1,0.5,False

He said he would cheerfully buy local spices.

I'm in need of nutmeg. And I'd rather keep the money on the island. I sell coffee through that store, and I've always found the owner reasonable about percentages. I like the fact there's no contracts, quotas, ""pay-to-play"" for shelf space and similar. Drop off; your stuff sells; pick up a check. There's a big local spice shelf right at the front of the store with too many empty spots. That should be for local spices. We've got the best, after all. And it's something tourists can take home with them with no issues. Seems like a win-win to me.

In general, the easier it is for a shopper to pick up a bag/bottle of spice and drop it in their basket, the more you'll make. (Lugging in a 5-gallon bucket of nutmeg isn't going to pay as much. Someone has to package it.)

Best time to drop off is Mon/Tues morning. On Wed/Sat, I'm at the store. I can sign for deliveries, but I can't do any negotiating.

I'm a 22 year old male, my twitching journey started about 10 weeks prior to this post, my eyelid started twitching at work wich I instantly attributed to stress/caffeine (heavy work load, several cups of coffee at work, energy drinks at the gym), a week after that I got my tetanus booster( if that is even relevant) and a week after that my whole body twitches started.

The first week I thought it was something gym-related (like DOMS or something), then another week passed with twitches everywhere, then another week, then I got worried and decided to ask a Gemini about muscle twitches which was a terrible idea. Like almost everyone here, I went down the rabbit hole of researching about ***, constantly asking Gemini and ChatGPT about how fasciculations relate to it, what some other early symptoms were, and it just went downhill from there.

I sat at work constantly googling, being hyper aware of my body, trying to feel every muscle twitch there was, I got home and lied in bed feeling twitches all over my legs. My fasciculations are whole body spread, when I stretch anywhere on my torso they trigger in my arms and shoulders, when I yawn they show up on my neck, lips, and cheeks; while sitting or lying in bed, they are very active in my legs. I wouldn't say they are excessive but they are most definitely several times a minute when I'm at rest.

About 4 weeks ago I even started missing the gym in case any muscle/lifts strength went down. My anxiety got pretty bad, I started asking ChatGPT about percentages, numbers, the chances of me getting *** at my age.

I don't have any weakness, in fact about 2 weeks ago I retook the gym and my strength has maintained and even improved in some lifts. I haven't had any foot tripping, any of my colleagues or friends tell me I'm slurring my words, any difficulty gripping things and as far as I can tell, any muscle atrophy. I do have some muscle aches, sudden stinging pain that lasts about 1 second in my arms and legs,  and some needle like pains in my foot when I've been sitting at work for too much time, as they go away when I get up and work. My symptoms also seem to disappear when I'm occupied, like talking to my boss, while at important meetings, or talking to my gf.

Aside from all that, my anxiety still tells me daily that I'm done for. I booked the best neuro I could find in my area (I'm Mexican if that is even relevant) and tomorrow I have my appointment. I really hope this is all BFS and my mind playing me very dirty. I hope a clean clinical test is enough to appease my mind. If not, I will be soliciting an EMG, I really hope I don't have to since it's crazy expensive here, almost a months salary. If even a clean EMG doesn't calm me, I will be booking an CBT therapy next haha.

Anyways, wish me luck, I will be updating tomorrow as soon as my appointments over. Any comments would be appreciated since I haven't really told anyone and the anxiety is eating me alive, only thing that calms me is reading the rest of the posts in here. I know because of my age or the lack of any weakness should really point me towards being in the clear, but the mind really plays tricks with you and ignores the facts.

Thank you guys, best wishes to all of us who are battling this thing.",2,1761188880.0,BFS,0,1.0,False
1odshou,https://www.reddit.com/r/u_MyBali_Trips/comments/1odshou/bali_for_slow_minds_what_happens_when_you_unplug/,Bali for Slow Minds: What Happens When You Unplug for a Week,"No Wi-Fi, no scooters, no Instagram. Just stillness.

I’ve been living in Bali for several years, and every few months, I take a week completely offline - no scooter, no work, no social media, no notifications. Just me, the island, and whatever shows up when things slow down.

Sounds simple, but the impact? Huge. If you’re overwhelmed, burnt out, or just craving a reset - Bali can hold space for that if you let it.

Let me walk you through what that looks like.

# Where I Usually Go for “Offline Weeks”

To truly unplug, I avoid Canggu, Ubud center, or anywhere near beach clubs. Instead, I head for:

* Sidemen – Green valley views, quiet homestays, zero digital noise.
* Munduk – Waterfalls, misty mornings, cool air.
* Pemuteran – Remote coast, coral reefs, dolphin-free silence.
* Amed – Peaceful seaside village with mountain energy.

I leave my laptop at home and only bring a dumb phone or switch my smartphone to airplane mode (permanently).

# I Walk Everywhere (And Notice Everything)

No scooter = no speed. I walk through rice terraces, local paths, and tiny villages. I:

* Meet farmers and chat over coffee.
* Pet dogs who follow me for blocks.
* Hear roosters instead of traffic.
* Watch clouds move like time-lapse footage in slow motion.

You’ll notice that walking connects you to the pace of the land. And it resets something in your brain.

# No Wi-Fi = Real Presence

Without being plugged in:

* I read. Like, *actual books*.
* I journal longhand.
* I sit and do nothing for 45 minutes and it’s not weird.
* I join random ceremonies I stumble into.
* I sleep at 9pm without blue light.

Your nervous system will thank you. It usually takes me 48 hours to stop craving a screen. By day 3, I feel like a human again.

# What I Look For in a Place to Stay

When planning these weeks, I book a simple local guesthouse:

* Run by a Balinese family
* No smart TV or coworking vibes
* Surrounded by nature
* Basic breakfast and a view — that’s it

Pro tip: if the listing brags about “fast Wi-Fi” and “content creation spots,” run.

# Why This Matters

Bali is beautiful, but it can be loud - not just from scooters and beach bars, but from the pressure to “do it all,” document everything, and optimize your tropical adventure.

Stepping away from that opens up something deeper.

* You hear your own thoughts.
* You remember how to be bored.
* You get curious again.

# Curious? Ask Me Anything

If you want to try this, I’m happy to recommend quiet villages, digital detox stays, or even ideas for how to ease into it without going full-analog. I don’t sell anything — just sharing what’s helped me reset, recharge, and reconnect with why I moved here in the first place.

They say sleep is the safest place on Earth — a private darkness where nothing can touch you.  
That’s a lie.

Sleep is not rest. It’s a door.

When we dream, our minds wander, but our bodies stay behind — empty houses waiting for something to come home. Every night, billions of us slip into paralysis and hope that whatever visits, whatever watches, will leave when morning comes.

Doctors call it “sleep paralysis.”  
Spiritualists call it “crossing the veil.”  
The truth is probably worse than both.

The case I’m about to share came from a missing person’s file that was quietly closed in 1991.  
The investigator’s name was **Abby Dubberlan**, a sleep technician and young mother who took on an unusual home visit in rural Oklahoma. The report was never officially submitted. Instead, her handwritten notes were found in a bloodstained notebook beside a child’s toy.

The toy’s brand and model don’t exist in any catalog.

What follows is her *unedited field log*, transcribed from recovered pages. The original handwriting becomes erratic near the end. Investigators marked several time stamps where they believe she was interrupted.

Read it if you want.  
But if you do — **don’t fall asleep tonight.**



Field Log — June 6, 1991

**Subject:** Drake ██████  
**Observer:** Abby Dubberlan  
**Location:** █████ County, Oklahoma



When I first met Drake, he came across as your typical six-year-old boy.  
Sweet. Shy. Polite.  
The kind of child who folds his napkin and says “thank you” for a glass of water.

Nothing stood out as odd — except how quiet the house felt.

His mother, Sarah, looked exhausted. There were deep shadows under her eyes, the kind that don’t come from a bad night’s sleep but from *too many* of them. She said Drake’s episodes began shortly after they moved here, after... what she called *the incident* with his father. She wouldn’t elaborate.

The house itself was small — two bedrooms, one bath, but it felt wrong somehow. No clocks ticking. No hum from the fridge. Just the steady creak of wood, like it was breathing along with us.

Every wall had crosses or scripture verses pinned to it.  
When I asked if she was religious, she told me *no.*  
Said they “just help keep things quiet.”

That’s when I started noticing the locks — not on the *outside* doors, but on **Drake’s bedroom door.** Heavy, metal, bolted from the hallway side. His window had burglar bars that didn’t match the frame.

She said it was to “keep him safe while he sleeps.”

I tried to laugh. She didn’t.

Drake followed me through the house with a toy clutched to his chest — a plastic werewolf missing one eye. He called it *Fred.* Every room we entered, he introduced Fred like a guest.

“This is where we fix bodies for Fred to eat. Yum!”

He said it sweetly, almost singing, his small hand rubbing his belly.  
Sarah didn’t even flinch. She’d heard it before.

Something about the way that toy stared at me — always facing my direction, even when I didn’t remember turning it — left a cold pressure behind my eyes.

I told myself it was just nerves.  
It wasn’t.



**Time:** 7:13 PM  
**Conditions:** Calm. Clear.  
**Temperature:** 73°F indoors — dropping.



Sarah was called into her night shift sooner than expected. She hesitated at the door, keys trembling in her hand.

“Lock him in if you need to,” she whispered. “You’ll understand.”

Her eyes didn’t meet mine.  
Then she left.

It was just me, Drake… and Fred.



**7:45 PM**  
Drake was surprisingly obedient — brushed his teeth, cleaned up after dinner, and even said grace on his own. He didn’t speak much, except to the toy.

“Fred’s tired. But not sleepy yet.”

His voice had that strange matter-of-factness that children use when they don’t realize they’re saying something impossible.

I noted that the air was colder near his chair than anywhere else in the room. Could’ve been a vent.  
Could’ve been.



**8:32 PM**  
We talked while the TV murmured. I asked about his dreams.  
He said sometimes they were “movies that never end.”

“They start nice,” he said, “but then they get stuck.”  
“Stuck?”  
“Like… the people can’t wake up, so they keep screaming.”

When he mentioned “the monster that looks like Daddy,” his tone shifted from fear to familiarity — like he’d accepted it. Like it visited often.

I tried to steer the conversation toward his toy, to see if “Fred” was an extension of that trauma.

“Fred came from there,” he said simply. “From the dream place.”

His gaze didn’t break.  
Neither did Fred’s.



**9:00 PM**  
Bedtime.  
Sarah’s written note said **“No exceptions.”**

Drake begged to stay up for a horror special at 10.  
I shouldn’t have agreed, but his smile was bright enough to make me forget every warning I’d just heard.

He curled up on the couch, toy in hand. Static flickered on the old TV screen. The picture stabilized into a cheaply made werewolf film — exactly what I didn’t need before a long night.



**10:07 PM**  
Drake was transfixed.  
Fred sat upright beside him on the coffee table, its one glassy eye catching the screen’s light.

Every so often, I could swear the toy had turned slightly — just enough that I could see its teeth.

I blinked and it was still again.

I told myself to relax. Imagination. Lighting. Pareidolia.  
Still, I made a note: *Possible RBD onset approaching — minor tremors in subject’s fingers.*



**10:43 PM**  
Drake fell asleep mid-scene. The TV kept playing.  
When I bent to lift him, the temperature dropped — a sharp, visible mist when I exhaled.

The channel glitched. For half a second, the screen showed what looked like a dark hallway, not part of the film.

Then static.

Then nothing.

I reached for the remote. That’s when I heard it.

A wet, slow **gurgle** — behind me.

The sound of something breathing wrong.

“Drake?”

No answer.

Dark, squiggling shadows pooled around his body like ink bleeding through the carpet.

When I turned back toward the coffee table—

Fred was gone.



**10:51 PM**  
My arms prickled with cold. The air hummed — a low, electrical tone you don’t hear so much as *feel* in your teeth.

I tried to move Drake, but he was impossibly heavy — not limp, not rigid, just wrong. Like gravity was thicker around him.

“Drake, wake up.”  
“Drake!”

His eyes snapped open all at once.

“Is the movie over?”

I nearly cried with relief.

He smiled, sleepy but calm.

“You stopped it too soon,” he murmured. “Fred was almost done.”



**11:00 PM**  
He wanted to keep watching. I gave him five more minutes. I shouldn’t have.

He stared blankly at the screen until it ended. Then he turned to me, still holding the toy.

“You were wrong,” he said softly. “The monster lived.”  
“It’s just a story, sweetheart.”  
“No,” he said. “It’s a dream. And it’s still hungry.”

For a moment, I thought about my daughter back home. She’d be curled up under her pink blanket, safe, breathing softly. I promised I’d call before midnight. I should’ve called by now.

  
**11:26 PM**

Drake’s asleep again.  
At least, I think he is.

His breathing doesn’t sound right — too slow, too… *thick.* Every inhale rattles like there’s someone else inside his lungs trying to get out. I tried waking him once more, but his eyes rolled under their lids like they were tracking movement only he could see.

Fred’s back on the floor, lying face-up toward the ceiling.  
The toy’s mouth is open wider than before. I checked — the plastic doesn’t bend like that.

I should have left an hour ago.  
But I promised Sarah I’d watch him through the night.



**11:52 PM**  
Temperature’s dropping again — I can see my breath. The walls are making a sound like… chewing. A damp, pulpy sound that moves in circles around the room.

I heard the locks on Drake’s door *click* on their own.

I swear to God, I didn’t touch them.

The refrigerator hummed for a moment, then stopped mid-cycle. The house went completely still. Even the crickets outside went silent, as if something larger had just arrived. The air smells metallic — like coins and old blood. The light bulb keeps flickering, and every time it goes out, I see a shape standing where Drake’s shadow should be. It bends when he doesn’t.

The wall clock read 11:12. When I blinked, it said 12:17. My wristwatch still said 11:12.



**12:07 AM**  
Something just whispered behind me.  
Sounded like *me.*  
Same voice.  
Same words I’m writing.

I dropped my pen, but when I picked it up again, there was handwriting already there — my handwriting — words I didn’t write:

“Stop waking him. He’s dreaming of you now.”

I want to scream but I can’t. The sound gets swallowed before it leaves my throat. The room eats noise.



**12:10 AM**  
He’s standing up.

Not walking.  
Just… standing.

His eyes are open, but they’re too dark, like the pupils swallowed everything else.

“Drake,” I said.  
No answer.

He turned his head slow, like it hurt. The smile that followed wasn’t his.

For a heartbeat, I saw my reflection move behind his eyes — not as a trick of light, but as if something had replaced him with me.

“Fred’s done playing,” he said. “It’s your turn now.”

Then he started laughing — a bubbling, breathless laugh that didn’t match the shape of his mouth.

I’m hiding under the desk. I don’t know what’s happening to him.  
Something’s wrong with the walls — they’re *moving.*  
Breathing.



**12:16 AM**  
If anyone finds this—

I’m tired, but wide awake.

I can hear him inside the walls, humming through my hands as I write.

If anyone finds this— the sound— it’s learning how to use my voice to travel.  
It’s finishing my thoughts before I do.

It’s colder now.  
Everything smells like pennies and wet fur.

Something’s scratching at the door — not to get in, but to keep something *in here with me.*

Drake’s humming.  
He doesn’t blink.

The shadows are longer now.  
They look like *hands.*

He’s walking toward me.

He’s whispering something.

It sounds like—

*(line trails off in ink and pressure marks)*



Post-Incident Summary (Extracted from police file #06-1991)

When investigators entered the residence two days later, they found no trace of Abby Dubberlan or the child known as “Drake.” The house showed signs of internal damage consistent with violent struggle — deep gouges in wood and plaster, originating from inside the locked bedroom.

The floorboards beneath the bed were warped by heat, though no fire occurred.

A melted wristwatch was recovered from the desk area, hands stopped at **12:17 AM.**

On the wall above the bed, written backward in soot and graphite:

“Don’t wake him.”

A single toy was discovered on the floor nearby.

It was not a werewolf.



**Editor’s Note (Recovered 2025)**

In 2004, a figure matching the toy’s description was reportedly found at a thrift store fire in Tulsa. The store’s CCTV footage froze at 12:17 AM — same as Abby’s watch.

Bargaining in Ethiopia is not just about saving a few Birr; it's about understanding the pulse of Ethiopian culture, making a connection, and enjoying a lively, unforgettable experience. Here’s your lighthearted survival guide to negotiating those beautiful handmade scarves, coffee pots, and souvenirs!

1. Start with a Smile, Not a Battle 🤝

Forget intense haggling. In Ethiopia, politeness and humor go a long way.

* **Lead with warmth:** A cheerful “Selam new?” (How are you?) is your best opening line. It shows respect and instantly makes the seller more willing to play ball.
* **The mantra:** Relax. Bargaining is a fun, social dance, not a confrontation.

2. Learn the Art of the Counteroffer 🎭

A quoted price is not a final price, it’s just the opening move in a theatrical performance!

* **The Rule of Halves:** If a vendor quotes Birr 2,000, counter with Birr 1,000. Prepare for mock disappointment, dramatic sighs, and perhaps a story about how you're ""ruining their business."" Don't worry, it's all part of the game!
* **Stay Calm:** Keep smiling and slowly work your way up. Whether it's at Shiro Meda or a village craft stall, patience is your currency.

3. Sprinkle in a Little Amharic ✨

Locals love it when foreigners try their language. It's a sign of respect and can genuinely earn you a better price. Try these easy phrases:

* **“Tirru waga sitegn”** ""Give me a good price.""
* **“Aykenisim?”** ""Can it be less than that?""

Even if your pronunciation is a bit off, the effort is what counts!

4. The Power of Acting Unimpressed 😎

This is the golden rule of Ethiopian market haggling: Never let them see your excitement.

* If your eyes light up at that perfect handwoven basket, the price instantly goes up.
* Instead, nod thoughtfully, ask about another item, or casually mention you saw something similar ""down the road.""
* The Walk-Away: If the price isn't right, walk away politely. Chances are, you'll hear ""Okay, come back! Special price for you!"" before you've gone two steps.

5. Enjoy the Theater of the Market ☕

Ethiopian markets are a sensory overload: chaotic, colorful, and loud. Don't rush! The atmosphere, the quick laughter, the playful back and forth, is half the fun.

* If you're feeling overwhelmed, take a break for a traditional Ethiopian coffee ceremony at a nearby stand. It's just as much a part of the market experience as the shopping.

6. Seal the Deal with a Smile 😄

Once you agree on a price, thank your vendor with a cheerful “Ameseginallehu!” (Thank you!).

You might still pay a bit more than a local, but you've gotten a great item, shared a cultural moment, and supported a small business. That’s a win!

**Travel Tip for Expats & Tourists**

* Always have cash (Birr) ready.
* Shop early to avoid the mid-day rush.
* Always keep an eye on your belongings in crowded areas.
* Be patient. The market experience is the purchase

1ods51a,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ods51a,NYC- Hotel Seville Nomad,"
Trip: Family of 4, 4 nights in NYC 

Hotel Goal: Hyatt with a guaranteed suite upgrade OR a room with two queen beds.

Current Findings:

Two queen beds seem to be the Hotel Seville and 2 Hyatt Centric. Picked Seville for a lower price.

The room is spacious for NYC, with:
  · Adequate floor space for luggage.
  · A small dining table.
  · Room to walk around comfortably.

The breakfast is cooked to order with a small menu. The waiter will check if you are Globalist. Technically, globalists will get one entree and one coffee/drink. Practically, the breakfast is waived as a whole in the final bill inclusive of tips and any extra or additional entries.

This is a pretty good deal, compared to Hyatt Centric in New Orleans which deducts the exact $35 for individual. We had two different waiters/waitresses during the four-night stay. One always automatically charge 18% for the breakfast, while the other one only charges the breakfast as shown. Inconsistent practices. I do notice that some guests got surprised by the question of ‘globalist’ as they wonder if they actually are. 

Eggs in camicia is pretty good! 


A small gym but well equipped with weights, rowing machine and one treadmill. 

The hotel is right next to bus stop M1/2/3. You can easily get to Mets museum, Central Park or Library, or SOHO. The whole foods market is right around the corner. Or Hashi Market, an interesting Japanese grocery store. K-town is two blocks away where abundant Korean and Pan-Asian food is available. 

A Lyft/Uber to airport is around $58-65.

1ods306,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ods306,24 shielded CAT6a retrofit! Took 3 weeks- (4 days per week),"Ok this is my biggest retrofit but not the biggest home. My approach was knock out the easiest runs first, this way I could learn more about the home and attic while still making progress.  This home didn’t have a crawlspace and 1/3rd of the runs were on the first floor while the rack was on the 2nd floor.  I had to cut a few access holes (all at outlet height from the floor above) and then do some wild drill shots.  I ran pull string for every location and found some very useful dead space for other pulls. I used every tool in my bag. Customer is very happy, and I’m happy it’s over.  Spent 1 week drilling, fishing walls, and adding pull string, I only spent 1 day pulling all wires back to the rack, and the. spent 2 days back feeding wires to more complicated areas, then spent one day terminating and testing, then one last day mounting devices. Customer bought his own equipment, I was just there to route wires and install. I will say this is my biggest job in residential, and beats the 16 drop record that was previously being held by a famous YouTubers/streamers home I did 2 years ago. I actually filled a Patch panel and only 3 locations were duals.  Ok I’m going to sleep- enjoy the pictures - of course my Apple vision was used for all drops -  it helped me figure out paths, efficiently route wires, find dead space and I didn’t need a helper until it was time to pull wire, all drill shots were done with my headset on. I needed a job like this to test my limits, now my usual 3-6 drop jobs will be small to me, and I’ll be more confident when quoting and selling my abilities. Not to mention we just had a newborn so I was doing all of this while running on fumes because I’m up helping with the feedings every 3 hours. Oatmeal and Coffee for breakfast, rotisserie chicken for dinner, hour drive to the customers home- thats been my life for 3 weeks. It’s over now.  Back to reality- posting on Reddit lol

Since then, through reading up more on it & speaking with some folks & learning more, I know I'm asexual. Anyway, without further ado, here's my post:

Meeting someone the old-fashioned way isn’t in the cards for me, so I’m here to find my other half (the better half) and life-partner who also wants to be part of a monogamous partnership built on emotional availability, the right chemistry, kindness, and shared purpose. If this post resonates with you, contact me if you also want to lead a healthy, productive, chosen-family life together.

About me: I’m a 28-year-old male, straight, born and raised and currently located in India. I’m of mixed Asian-European (“Anglo-Indian”) descent. I have a Christian background though I’m irreligious, & speak English as my native-first language. I’m 5’8”, work out regularly (recently went through a weight loss journey), and live a health-conscious lifestyle so I don’t smoke, drink, etc.

Interests-wise, my oldest love has always been photography (film photography too once I get the time), the cinema, listening to music (my playlist's link is on my profile, please share yours with me too), theatre (ask about hat time I saw an Italian-operatic production of Macbeth in Vienna), traveling (all the time, really), having (way too much) coffee, reading (mostly non-fiction all my life), learning & speaking languages (English native, 3 others), writing (both as a hobby and now professionally), comedy (it’s an art-form truly, and any partner of mine has to have a sense of humor, sorry, but this is a non-negotiable), checking out new cuisines in new restaurants, visiting cafes, museums, galleries, and libraries, being out in nature in parks and trails, and listening to history or popular-science podcasts especially as background noise while working and/or writing my master thesis.

It’s okay if your hobbies and interests are different; that way, we’d both be introducing one another to a diverse range of activities and pastimes for the rest of our lives. I understand the need for space as well, it’s okay to make changes & tune our individual lifestyle presences to vibe together as a couple.

I wouldn’t want either of us to plateau. I’m open to marriage & open to relocating for or with my future partner as I’m rather serious about settling down, and not engage in endless texting & casual dating.

I’m not posting here looking for a penpal where we would just be light on a screen for each other. If we don’t exist together in reality, then we’d just be in love with ideas of one another, not our real selves. So it’d be great to bridge the gap if see ourselves living a shared-future together.

Honestly? Just hope that we really like each other & our goals in life are aligned. That's really all that matters the most.

I believe that not everything has to be perfect. Some differences & red flags are expected and natural as long as we’re willing to work on ourselves, on each other, & we’re both willing to put in equal effort into the relationship & keep our word & make no sudden 180s. There's way too many over-complications in today's day and and age with the amount of dating options and thinking we're better off alone which leads to all this loneliness everywhere experienced by everyone, that all can be eradicated through simply zeroing in and matching on the essentials & working everything else out along the way.

So, yeah... If what you’ve read so far resonates with you, it’d be lovely to hear from you. If we connect, it would be great for us to both share selfies so we have an idea of who we’re talking to.",2,1761187235.0,asexualdating,0,1.0,False

Women on my dad's side consistently get them, and my mom's side has other hormonal issues.  
  
In middle school, I’d get them 3+ times a week (usually triggered by hunger, poor sleep, stress, or strenuous activities) but they’d go away with rest. In high school, after we moved states, I started getting barometric pressure headaches on top of the migraines. Sleep stopped helping, and I began seeing blind spots and floaters on bad days. I became extremely sensitive to light and sound, which would make me nauseated. If I didn't have a migraine, I had a dull headache or brain fog. 

A doctor once gave me samples of three prescriptions, but none worked.   
  
Anywho, over time painkillers stopped helping, so I just learned to manage. We suspected food was a factor. Some headaches eased after eating (especially during cross country season), but others got worse, which was confusing.

Recently, I noticed I rarely get migraines anymore—maybe 1–3 times a month, and they’re manageable with food, sleep, or painkillers. The turning point was realizing that sugar was a major trigger. If I eat sweets right after a meal or without protein/fiber, I get a migraine. Now I pair sugar with protein, move more after meals, and avoid binge eating. I don’t track blood sugar, but this shift lines up with when I shifted my sugar habits. I still eat a ton of sweets, but now I spread them out differently. 

Further proof for this was after an elimination diet (for psoriasis and migraines) I drank flavored lattes and got dull headaches but could drink plain coffee or tea with milk without any issue. I was so used to these headaches that I didn't realize how frequently I had them because they were pretty much constant. Making sure I don't have a flavored latte on an empty stomach or getting it half-sweet has been a good alternative. 

TLDR: Being mindful of blood sugar has cut my migraines from 3+ times a week with constant dull headaches, to just a few times a month with no aura or nausea.",10,1761187118.0,migraine,0,1.0,False

I hope you can offer some input on this.....

In late July an acquaintance found Grey Tree Frog tadpoles in her gardening bucket.  I've raised tadpoles before, so I said I'd take them.  So I've had about 50 tadpoles in three bowls for about 3 months.  I lost 4 tadpoles, but have successfully released 37 froglets so far.  I really love the little dudes!

I've had some kind of allergies or sinus infection since spring, meaning it started before the tadpoles, which has caused my eyes to be swollen, sinus headaches, which have gotten worse.  Recently I've even developed breathlessness, so I'm worried about a respiratory infection.  I'm taking an antibiotic that doesn't seem to be helping.  I have an appt with an allergist in a few weeks.

The tadpoles didn't start this, but I recall the last time I raised tadpoles I developed allergy symptoms.

I never touch the tadpoles, but I do hover over the bowls closely every day as I use a turkey baster to suck up waste, feed them and add fresh water, so I have respiratory contact with their water and waste.  I transport the froglets to release sites in a styrofoam coffee cup, but never physically handle them.

I'm wondering cause I just read that Grey Tree Frogs release toxins that can irritate eyes, lips and skin, but haven't read tadpoles do.  Has anyone here had new or worsened allergy symptoms or respiratory infections that could be related to raising tadpoles?

I originally planned to check out the Ginza location since it aligned with other plans nearby, but when I saw the line there around 11am, I decided to take a chance on their newest Tokyo location instead. That gamble paid off—no line, and we got straight to the coffee.

The coffee was excellent, and the experience lived up to expectations. Now I understand the hype. That said, both before and after Glitch, I visited numerous other coffee shops in Tokyo and some offering equivalent quality and taste. Few even provide the same experience of selecting beans at the counter and watching baristas work with those fancy drippers and frozen titanium balls.

So is Glitch overhyped? I don't think so, but it's important to understand what you're getting. It's like going to a high-end restaurant, just for coffee. This isn't your daily coffee shop where you pop in on your way to work. It's a destination where you gain access to exceptional beans—the kind used to win barista championships—with origins and quality you won't find at your grocery store or even most ""regular"" coffee shops. More importantly, it's where that coffee will be prepared with an exceptional degree of skill. And yes, that comes at a premium price.

Coffee, like many things, is somewhat personal, and we each have our own preferences. Those preferences evolve with experience, and visiting Glitch just might influence yours. Was my mind blown?

I'd just had a pretty rough breakup. Lots of red flags that I just ignored. I won't name any names here, but I eventually caught on that he was never actually going to rehab. He was actually going even harder on the meth and screwing other guys behind my back. Again, lapses in judgement, far too trusting, really fell for his sob stories. It all came crashing down when I found out he was inviting his junkie fuck-toys to my house while I was away at work. I felt myself sinking far too late to stop it.

By the end of the affair, I was just thankful he was out of my house and my life, and that the junkies had stopped showing up.

But reality does have a way of creeping back in. My reality was that I couldn't afford the repayment on the house and the lot rental. The only way I did was back when I rented one of the rooms out to George, one of my best friends - one my Ex tried to convince me to kick out with the promise he'd ""eventually find the right job"" for himself and help cover it. He just ended up doing it himself by pushing his buttons, George had always been kind of a hothead. Just came home one day to find out he'd moved. Ex turned it into his own personal achievement.

So I turned to the safest options for finding someone I could trust as a roommate: Craigslist and a posting on the classifieds board in the IGA. I don't mess around with Facebook or any of that shit, and I didn't have time to go around and try to mend bridges with old friends. It wasn't like I could do any worse, right? 

After a few weeks of radio silence, he showed up at my front door. Once again, multiple red flags. Really unkempt, long hair, somewhere between a greasy Jesus and Rasputin. His clothes seemed to be a weird mix of far too small or far too large, brand new and threadbare. His shoes looked like he'd never taken them off. He stunk, but smelled kind more... dirty. Like actual dirt, dirt soaked with old sweat. His eyes were freaky. Green, but, like... most people with green eyes, they're a mix of brown and blue and *mostly* green, which is completely normal. His were the purest emerald-green I'd ever seen. Or maybe it was just the wide-eyed stare that made them look like that, I can't say.

""Hey man, can I...?"" I started to ask, when he slowly held up the print-out I'd put up at the IGA. I'd taken the time to cut out the little tabs at the bottom with the contact information, and this guy had taken the whole thing. Great, that would explain the lack of calls. ""You're here for the room?""

""Ye-ah,"" came the soft, raspy voice in reply. I'd never heard anyone who could make a single syllable sound like two, the word spoken in separate, almost breathless little huffs. 

""You got the first month's rent? If you'd called ahead I would have offered to show you the place first."" 

He slowly rummaged around in his hoodie pocket, and pulled out a crumpled wad of cash. Reluctantly, I took it. I was pretty shocked when I counted it up - $350 on the dot in twenties, fifties, and a hundred. It all clicked for me at this point. This guy was homeless, obviously, and it was mid-October now. The way it works around here is that bums will live on the streets or in a car during the Spring and Summer, save up all they can, and rent a place for the winter since the shelters tend to fill up too quick. Once the last frost passes, they move back onto the streets to save up again.

I felt a little sympathy for him, right then. I'd never done much in the way of charity or donations. A nod, a wave, a polite conversation, maybe a few bucks doled out. Maybe lending a hand over the winter would be my repentance for that, it wasn't like I had much else to give. He did have the money, after all. Mostly likely would've been stolen or panhandled, but I was desperate. It had been 50-to-60-hour weeks on-end by that point. And if the worst comes to the worst, my bedroom door had a deadbolt keyed separately to the house, and I still kept my dad's revolver on me.

He didn't have any questions while I showed him the place, never said much anyways, maybe just another occasional ""ye-ah"" in a general affirmative. He did have a tendency to stare - at everything, like he was always on edge. Again, he didn't have to be normal, just... stable enough. Told him he was free to use the kitchen and bathroom as long as he cleaned up, I'd respect his privacy if he respected mine, and if I even got the hint that he was doing drugs I'd call the cops - all things I'd made clear on the listing. Again, no rebukes. And that was that, I let him to his own devices and he didn't bother me for the rest of the day. 

Never got a name from him. Never offered one. Came to think of him as ""Hobo Bob"", and I don't *think* I ever called him that to his face. Something tells me he wouldn't have cared all that much if I did. 

Within the week after he moved in, I was out on the porch in the morning with my coffee. I was caught up in worrying about a fluid leak on my car - I couldn't tell where it was coming from or if it was severe enough to take in, and I was sure if I did I was going to get fleeced. I was trying to figure out if I'd be able to make the walk to work in time if it came to it when a noise crackled out of the darkness somewhere, and I ended up dropping my mug. Funny thing, I knew exactly what it was that second, but it still managed to catch me off guard. We'd had foxes that lived around town ever since I was a kid, usually in the outskirts of the suburbs, but sometimes they made their way in town for food. Seeing them was not uncommon, hearing them slightly less so. But this was the first time I'd heard one while living there. A single, raspy scream, and a rustle of leaves somewhere off in the brush. Surprising, sure, but it seemed explainable enough. After a few seconds of silence just to process it, I picked up the bigger pieces of porcelain and went back inside, and forgot about it once I got to work. 

That weekend was one of the first in a while where I wasn't working overtime, getting a little bit of a break in with Bob covering his part of the rent. I was prepared to have to deal with him over the course of the day, a worthy trade-off in my perception. But I didn't see him for most of it - from what I could tell, he mostly went out at night, leaving past sundown and coming back by dawn. In fact, I hadn't noticed much evidence of him living there at all. Occasionally, I heard the faucet in the bathroom running, but never the shower - whatever, up to him. Maybe I noticed a few things missing from the kitchen, but never any dirty dishes or cups or beer cans. The only definite things were the faint smell, and more dirt on the carpet. 

The smell actually might have been worse than I thought, in retrospect. My sense of smell has always been pretty poor since I was a kid, some kind of defect in my sinuses a doctor might've told me at some point. Anything would have to be really strong or really close for me to notice it. It helped at times, meant I could put up with a lot, but it made it easier for me to miss things.

Early Sunday morning, I was folding a load from a laundry run when I heard the front door open and shut, and steps slowly amble across the living room. I kept listening as I worked, and an unnerving thought started to wile its way in. It was one thing to invite some guy I didn't know to move in, but another for me to be living in the same house as someone I almost never saw, let alone knew. I'd expected that getting to know Bob better would have been a give-in, whether or not I liked it. Having a roommate that makes it feel like you're living alone seems like a blessing in theory. Come to think of it, had I seen him again after the first night? Was it even the same person I invited in, or could he have just sold the key to someone else on the streets? It may as well have been one of my Ex's junkie friends out there. I made my way to the bedroom door, and I heard the steps wander near it, coming down the hall. I felt the butt of the pistol in my waistband. I clicked the deadbolt open. The steps ran down the hall. I opened my door, and Bob's slammed shut. 

The sound of another fox call outside woke me up during that night.

Wednesday or Thursday, I got home late from work. I was in the kitchen prepping a Banquet pot pie when the door down the hall creaked open. I looked up. The view from behind the counter is a dead shot down the hall. It was lit only by the light from the living room, leaving the far end in darkness. Nothing, and yet I wouldn't look away. This felt... unfamiliar. It didn't feel like I was looking at a place in my house. Like I was looking down a well. Down into a cave. Into a hole. And I felt like there was something in that darkness, just out of view, staring right back. I stood there, waiting to see who would come into the light. What would come into the light. I felt like I knew it wouldn't move until I looked away. Stop it, I tried to stop myself from weirding out. Relax, it's fine, just act normal and things will be normal. Bob's unusual, but it doesn't help when I get so defensive when he really hasn't done anything wrong, it can only make it worse. I focused back on getting the pot pie package open. The steps started down the hall and into the living room. Something about the cadence made me feel like he was looking at me the entire time.

""Hey, how's things going?"" I kept my voice as casual and non-defensive as possible, casting up a glance towards him, ""You want anything? I can thaw one out for you too."" He *had* been looking at me, but it was still Bob, at least.

""N-ah,"" the only other word I'd heard from him, spoken much in the same way. He continued towards the front door. 

""Alright, you have a good night, man,"" I decided to leave it at that, and he ambled out the door into the night. 

I did notice a few things. Some of the clothes he'd shown up in were significantly dirtier. He had a jacket on over the sweatshirt, now, too. Also dirty, but it still had the store tag hanging off of the cuff - Walmart, from the look of it. That was all explainable enough. The odd part was his hands. I thought he had gloves on at first, but as I thought back on it, I realized they weren't gloves. His hands were completely coated in something dark, clinging to his skin and staining it the same color. Dark, wet dirt. Ran up his sleeves, coated his pant legs, caked his old sneakers. I just stood there for a while thinking over the fact. Made me wonder what he was doing all that time he was gone. Every night. 

I went back to my room with the pot pie, and tried to let it be - just finish dinner and go to bed. Once I was sure he wasn't coming back, though, I couldn't help it. I went down the hall and up to his door. I stood there for a few seconds contemplating if I really had enough of a reason to go in - what I wanted to see, or what I didn't want to see if I did. If I had an answer, I've forgotten it since. I pushed it open.

I'd set up a twin bed in the room and some basic furnishings as a courtesy. The mattress was stuffed into the closet, now. The sheets and blankets were piled up into a corner, heavily stained. The smell of urine was distinct, which meant it was bad. The beige carpet was a camoflauge-esque patchwork of yellow and brown. More dirt, leaves, sticks, food wrappers were gathered in the other corners. Under the bedframe, there was more of it, and that was where I found the first little group of bones. Small, probably a cat at the biggest. Picked clean. I moved the bedframe over. More groups of bones. The duffel bag, probably blue at some point but now stained to a black-brown, was on top of the bedframe. There wasn't any food or any of his clothes in it. There were fox pelts. All rotten, some looking ancient, some far more fresh. Half a dozen or so. I'd been sleeping two doors down from this nightmare.

A couch pulled up against the front door, I stayed up all night waiting for him to come back. When I realized he was pushing at the front door, I pulled it open just enough to get a full look at him, and started shouting at the top of my lungs. I can't even remember what I said. I don't remember if I pulled the gun out or just had my hand on it. I was tired, and I was the angriest I'd been in my life. Whatever I was doing, it seemed to get the message across. He backed away, one cautious, smooth step at a time, keeping a steady pace all the while glaring at me with those glassy eyes. He went back as far as I could see him, then he was gone. I kept shouting even as he vanished. I'm certain I drew the attention of neighbors, but I didn't care. They'd probably gotten used to it by then. Finally, I ran back to his room, grabbed the duffel bag, and threw it outside, before barricading the door again, and collapsing to the ground in a heap. 

The police said it wasn't likely they'd be able to press any charges. No signed rental agreement, so I couldn't charge him for property damages. The bones didn't prove he'd killed the animals. Even if he had, the owners would have to file charges for that. I told them about the pelts, but they couldn't find the bag outside. At most, that could have been an illegal hunting charge, if provable. At a minimum, if he came back, I could file a restraining order. They left, I forced myself to sleep on the couch for two hours, called a locksmith at sunup, called in sick to work, and called George.

It wasn't all bad news, I thought. I'd gotten the time I needed to make amends with some people, including my old roomie, George. I invited him out for drinks I couldn't really afford. I told him about everything that I'd gotten myself into, how I knew it was all my fault for being such a pushover. I begged for him to come back when the room was livable again. Told him I was done fucking up time after time. Admitted that I needed him just to get things back to normal - to get myself back to normal. It all hit me at once, and then I was spilling tears out onto the bar top. I didn't want to pressure him into it, but I couldn't hold it back. I felt so tired. So alone.

I don't know, maybe I did feel something... more for George. Maybe I never wanted to consider it, but the sense of comfort I got from spending time around him, there were times that I really needed it to keep going. It was a comfort I never got from anyone else. One that I felt like I didn't deserve for everything I'd done up to then. He was the only person I'd been able to trust, and I threw that away. I needed it, I wanted it, but I didn't think I deserved it. I would never take it for myself.

Thankfully, he agreed, even offered to help with the cost for the cleaning. He told me the only way he'd move back was if it was ""deep-cleaned as deep as could be cleaned"", and didn't want me to ""skimp out"". He recommended a biohazard cleaning service that his buddy worked at. It was expensive, and it would take a full day, but it included a full replacement of the carpet. George's other stipulation was to spend a few nights helping him pack up his stuff and move some things into storage. Whatever it took, I'd do it. 

I ended up spending those few nights at his place. I was a little relieved to get a break from the disaster my own home had become. I was relieved to have his company. 

I went back home the night before George was supposed to move in, to meet up with one of the cleaners to do a quick walkthrough. The mattress, sheets, dresser, and nightstand had to be thrown out, but the metal bedframe was fully sanitized. Most importantly, the wallpaper and carpets were brand new and odor-free. Standing in that same doorway now, the sense of relief was incredible, but short-lived.

""By the way, man,"" the husky man interjected as he produced a carbon-copy invoice from a clipboard, ""you might want to call an exterminator or something.""

""What? Why?""

""Not sure what, but I definitely heard somethin' under the floor while we were working, maybe in your crawlspace? Couldn't find any evidence nearby, but with these pre-builts they're open-air and all, it's easy for them to get in. Y'know, I know someone - they do good work, if it's alright I'll give them your number and ask them to give you a call.""

""U-uh... sure. Sure, Sorry, thank you."" I couldn't be upset with him. It wasn't his fault, or his problem to fix, after all. But after he left, and I just sat in the empty living room, I couldn't bring myself to make a single move without thinking it over. Something under the floor. Something. Under me. Right now? I waited there, for any kind of sign. Nothing. I could tell myself it was some animal. That it was a fox or something - fox... the memory of the duffel bag made my guts curdle. But I couldn't rule out the possibility. 

Slowly and as quietly as I could manage, I got up off the couch, went over to the door, descended the front steps, and turned to look back at the house. Perfectly still, saturated in orange by the setting sun. Anything out of place. Any sign of intrusion. Any sign of him. I rounded the house to the back, and went to the large board under the kitchen window, covering the crawlspace access. In place, as it should be. Was there a way an animal could've gotten in anywhere else? I thought about going up and pulling the board away. 

Then I thought about those glints of bright green, meeting me there. I thought about being grabbed and pulled in to that cavernous, lightless space, and the board being slid back closed. I thought about them finding my body after that. Or not finding it. Or ending up in that duffel bag. I thought I could faintly smell urine and damp earth, or was it just my nerves telling me that? Was he already waiting right past the door? Only separated by a cheap plywood board and vinyl siding? Did he already know I was standing there? Did he know that I knew? 

I slid the new key into the deadbolt and sealed up the house again. Staring at it from the driver's seat, I had to force my eyes back on the road as I drove away. 

I should've just called George and waited. I should've called the police, even if I didn't have any evidence or objective justification. But I'm not unfamiliar with mistakes, after all. No, I drove back to George's apartment, and told him in person. I expected him to tell me it was an overreaction and just go back home, or offer to come over and help clear the crawlspace. Instead, he just gave me a long hug. I don't know if he ever knew how I felt about him, but it hurts me to say that he probably knew me a lot better than I thought. It was the closest we'd been, that night - the closest we'd ever be. He told me to stay the night and we could check it out in the morning.

I'd only learned how heated things had gotten between my Ex and George well after the breakup. George came home that day to find one of my Ex's friends asleep in his bed, and needless to say he wasn't having it, banging his fist on the frame and yelling at him to get out. And this big, lumpy-faced biker dude tries to give him a death glare while half-asleep and half-buzzed. It missed the mark, George told him to leave or he'd kick his ass, and he lumbered back down the hall, still trying to stare him down without tripping over his own feet. Then he found out his clothes had been picked through, a couple of his nicer shirts gone and a sweatshirt that smelled like rotten vinegar left behind. He started to check the rest of the room. Chargers, the cash in his nightstand, his flash drives, his buckskin jacket, he just kept finding more and more shit missing. He stormed out into the living room and confronted the guy, and of course he denied it. George tried to challenge it, but then my Ex got up and tried to talk him back. Said that since he was dating me, he ""owned this place more than you do, so you better not talk to my friends like that, or I'll have your sorry ass out in the gutter."" Then he added that he ""liked fucking in that room anyways, so you better get used to sharing.""

George went back to the room, loaded up a backpack, and went over to a friend's place to ask if he could bunk there for a while. She said yeah, so he came back about an hour later to pick up the rest of his things, only to find his room gutted. Ex made some snarky remark and George turned right around and decked him. Big biker guy came up and socked him in the eye, knocked him to the ground, and they both just started waling on him. Didn't stop him from trying to fight back - he grabbed the big guy's leg and yanked, pulling him off balance and toppling over on top of my Ex. Got to his feet and knocked his bald, meaty head with a steel toe. He got down right into my Ex's face and demanded him to ""tell me what you did with all my shit!"" Ex elbowed him in the throat. Big guy tried to pull a knife on him, but wasn't slick at all with it, managing to cut his own hand up worse than George. But still, the hits kept coming, and he realized there wasn't any chance he'd win this - one against two, his odds were never good. And what was he fighting for? There wasn't a chance my Ex was going to get him his stuff back - it was all probably long gone by that point. Never got any of it back, from what I remember. For all that he knew, I'd picked my Ex over our friendship. So he just turned around and left. 

George held a grudge against him, which had been rekindled when I reconnected with him. A few too many beers that night loosened up a rant about how he just *knew* it was my Ex's fault this all happened. Too perfect to just be a coincidence. Said he wouldn't be surprised if my Ex had sought out the craziest fucker he could find and handed my flyer to him, maybe gave him the money for it. Just so he could claim another victory over someone who'd wronged him. As he sunk deeper into it, George started to work himself up something awful. He claimed that my Ex might've hoped the guy would try to cut my throat, or set the house on fire, or steal everything I had, or rape me. I tried to calm him down, tell him it wasn't something we needed to think about now, that if it escalated the police would handle it, and he snapped back. 

""For fucks sake, James, you have no right not to be mad! If I met him face-to-face today I'd put a hole in his chest and put him the ground! People like him can't get away with this, and you can't let /him/ do it to you!"" 

It took me and one of George's other roommates to calm him down, and even then it took a while, but he didn't bring it up again the rest of the evening. Maybe we should have just let him work it out then, after all, trying to talk with him about it, wait with him until he'd sobered up again. But instead I just stopped worrying about it, afterwards. I fell asleep relaxed, thinking about how things were going to be better in the morning.

I woke up on the communal couch. When it was still dark out, and the apartment was silent, I felt something was wrong. I went up to his room, and pushed open the door. My stomach sank like lead. His shotgun case was on the bed, open. The gun was gone. And he wasn't there.

His parking spot was empty as I ran towards my car. I drove too fast and slid into the mound of mushy, churned snow that had been piled up on the shoulder of 12th, and wasted almost 10 minutes digging myself out and getting back onto the road. I practically fell out of my car when I got back home.

The house was dark. His car was parked across the front lawn. No signs of activity. I pulled out the revolver, cocked it, and swung open the wheel. 4 rounds of .38. They'd been in there for a while, but it was better than being empty. I swung it shut, and made my way to the back of the house, moving cautiously.

The cover was sitting off to one side of the deep black rectangle beneath the kitchen window. There were no sounds, no signs of movement. I put the gun up, and got the courage to speak. 

""George?"" It came out far too quiet, but I wasn't ready to get any louder. Nothing. 

I crouched closer to the hole, stopped, and listened. Nothing. ""George?"" A little louder, but no more of a response.

On my knees, I paused at the very edge of the opening. Nothing. 

I pulled out my phone, put on the flashlight, and crept in an inch, sweeping around the edges of the opening and trying to keep the pistol aimed. The light was pathetic, showing the first couple of feet ahead within the chasmic darkness as I inched further and further in. When I climbed past a drainage pipe, something glinted in the edge of the light, and I stopped. I suddenly felt stranded. I had held on to some amount of hope that everything would be better by the morning. That this would all be over, and things would be better. 

The shotgun laid in the dirt, abandoned. My mind spun as I tried to think about what I could do by that point. My knuckles went white, gripping the pistol tighter. 

My eyes drifted across the area. I picked out another anomaly in the light, an unusual, large mound in the dirt. I got a little closer, trying to see around it. Right before the mound I found the hole. 'Fox den' comes to mind whenever I think back to it, but it's a poor descriptor. It was too big for that - had to have been 2 feet or more in diameter. Damp earth packed into a rough circle, the imprints of palms and fingers a grotesque frame around the black aperture. The smell of urine was undeniable. I brought up my phone, and stuck it down into the hole. 

The bottoms of George's shoes faced back up at me. 

""G-George??"" The words burst out, threatening to tear my chest open.

The shoes shot deeper into the hole with a solid scrape, out of view.

Something like a fox's bark echoed from down inside, far too close.

In the dash out of the crawlspace, I dropped my phone. It was at least 10 seconds in that complete darkness, stumbling blind, trying to listen for a sign of movement while scrambling through the dirt. I dove through the entry, ran to the nearest neighbor, and tried to convince her to call the police for me. She wasn't having it, though. It wasn't until I got to the third house that I was able to put a call in. I don't ask why, all I know is that it took too long.

The police found George's body in that hole, throat cut. It went down quite a ways. They only found a duffel bag, George's wallet, and trash at the very bottom. No one else was there, he'd already gotten away again. The plentiful DNA evidence told the police everything they would find out anyways.

George became the latest victim of John Saint-John - unrelated - who had become known as 'The Fox Hole Killer'. Saint-John had run away from his family as a child, remained missing for 20 years, and reemerged as a kind of specter. One that drifted across the United States, leaving a trail of 'burrows' and bodies. He blended into the drifting waves of homelessness, 'just another bum' to passers by. When he found someplace he could settle down - get food and clothes and suitable cover - he would build a burrow and live there. The theory was that his victims were the ones to find his 'den', and once the den was discovered he would flee it, and move on.

Once he'd struck and fled, no one could seem to pick him out of the crowd. Never in the same place twice. By the time the local police would learn about him, he was already gone. Federal agents had no luck on keeping track of him, striking months or years apart on different sides of the country, no perceivable pattern in his movements. They all knew who it was, and it didn't help them a damned bit.

About the fox pelts, and the unusual uptick in fox activity that people started to report wherever he had lived, no one pretended to understand.

The DNA evidence cleared my name, and I gave the police a statement on how I'd come to know Saint-John and the events had lead up to that night, giving George's old roommate's name to back my story up. I did my part, giving the best description I could. Saint-John's face was swathed underneath matted hair, and the only detail I could give any accurate description of were his eyes, an approximate height, and his build. 

I never went back to that house. I quit my job, packed up what I had, and moved in with my uncle several states over. Even though I hadn't spoken to him since mom died, he offered to let me stay there while I worked on getting the house sold, eventually taking a loss just to get it over with. I was able to find a job nearby, and rented out the basement level of his house. 

And almost every night, I find myself dwelling on it, asking myself if *all* of it had really been my fault. Not one of my actions had prevented what happened. I gave in to my Ex, and drove everyone away. I let Saint-John into my house. And that night, it could have been me that looked down into that hole, looked Saint-John in his emerald eyes one last time. But by acting on my own cowardice, it was George instead. I moved away, trying to blame the house for all of it, trying to wash my hands clean by giving it all up, but the guilt stuck like cigarette tar.

I'll never fully get over it, and the nights seem to drag on longer and longer. Even if I could, it's not like I could fall asleep anyways.

1odro8l,https://www.reddit.com/r/letsdrawconclusions/comments/1odro8l/not_sure_what_and_how_to_write/,Not sure what and how to write?,"Have you tried every possible approach to writing and still don’t know what to write or how to write about it?
Nothing seems to click with you?

Like with every new skill, the modern civilized human has become so impatient. They want the magical solution right away, without trying. And they search and search and search for other people’s solutions on YouTube.


Don’t despair over not finding what you’re looking for (fast enough). Bouncing around between approaches, ideas, and routines is a normal part of building self-awareness.
You need all of those experiences with yourself to observe how you, your mind, and your body react to them in real life.

Take meditation, for example. Before I settled on my current routine, I bounced around between a thousand different approaches.

Guided meditations, silent meditations, eyes open, eyes closed, lying down, seated, with music, walking, relaxing or activating.

It’s normal that we don’t want to go through that process because it’s time-consuming, frustrating, and lengthy.
Everything our modern inattentive brain doesn’t want.


In her book The Right to Write, Julia Cameron mentions the importance of being comfortable with yourself and your approach.
Some write formally, some take it easy.

Some write fast, some write slow.
Some long, some short.
Do I like writing while I walk?
Do I like writing while I drink coffee, water, beer?
In an armchair? No, my neck hurts.
On my phone? Tablet? Computer? Pen and paper?


Experience all of them for yourself.

Should I use Dan Koe’s, Nick Kole’s, or Justin Welsh’s writing framework?
Collecting and analyzing them won’t get you closer to an answer.
You need all of the trial and error to get to know yourself.
For some, it takes one month to find their groove, others need to experiment for six years.
The important part is to closely observe yourself. Reflect and learn about what works for YOU.

Have fun in the process and don’t let anyone tell you they have THE solution for you. They probably don’t. But they might have SOME solution that brings you closer to self-awareness and self-understanding.

If you can’t keep up with 3000-word posts, make them 200-word posts. If that doesn’t work, write one sentence. If that feels worthless, write ten.

If, after months of trial and error, it turns out that writing may not be your thing, try drawings, illustrations, videos, or comics.

No one will ever be able to tell you what activity, approach, or routine is for you. They can’t experience and feel for you.
The feeling when you actually perform the action will be your signpost.

So dive right into it and listen closely to how you feel, but don’t give up too early and don’t shy away from going back and forth to try and retry.

Happy practicing!

I’ve been noticing that I’ve gotten tired earlier tho like by 7pm and I’m not sure if it’s cause of coffee crash, not eating enough protein even tho I think I eat enough, or the workouts being too much.

# 💨 What Is an Oxygen Bar?

An oxygen bar delivers concentrated oxygen — typically around **90–95% purity** — that’s mixed with **aromatherapy scents** like peppermint, lavender, or citrus. Guests inhale this purified oxygen for 5–15 minutes through a disposable nasal cannula while relaxing in a comfortable setting.

The experience is often described as **refreshing, energizing, and calming**, depending on the aroma blend used.

# ⚗️ Why Are They Becoming So Popular?

1. **Stress Relief in a Fast-Paced World** Between work, traffic, and constant screen time, people are seeking short, restorative breaks. A few minutes of pure oxygen with calming scents can help users feel mentally clearer and more relaxed.
2. **Natural Energy Boost (No Caffeine Crash)** Instead of reaching for another cup of coffee, some people are turning to oxygen bars for a natural pick-me-up. Higher oxygen intake can promote alertness and focus without the jittery side effects.
3. **Wellness & Event Trend** Oxygen bars have become popular at **corporate wellness events, weddings, trade shows, and festivals**. They offer a “wow” factor — an interactive wellness experience that guests actually talk about.
4. **Aromatherapy Synergy** Combining essential oils with oxygen enhances the experience. For instance:
   * **Peppermint** = energizing
   * **Lavender** = calming
   * **Citrus** = mood-boosting
   * **Eucalyptus** = refreshing and clearing
5. **Corporate & Workplace Wellness** Many companies are exploring oxygen therapy stations as part of **employee wellness programs**, helping combat fatigue and promote mindfulness during long workdays.

# 🚀 Why Now?

With rising awareness around **mental health, burnout, and biohacking**, oxygen bars fit neatly into the modern wellness landscape. They’re portable, safe, and easy to set up — making them a natural fit for health-minded communities and forward-thinking workplaces.

# 🌱 Bottom Line

An oxygen bar isn’t about medical treatment — it’s about **wellbeing, recovery, and mindfulness** in a world that rarely slows down. Whether it’s a few minutes at a wellness fair or a regular perk at work, people are discovering that a little more oxygen might be exactly what they’ve been missing.",1,1761186278.0,OxygenBar,0,1.0,False

It was just on discount, and I thought I would try it out.

On the first coffee I brewed with it, I was kind of an idiot because I kept swirling after each pour. This defeated the purpose of the Drip Assist, since it agitates the coffee for you. Needless to say, I ended up with a tasteless coffee.

So, I'm asking those of you who own the Hario Drip Assist: what's the best use you've found for it? And how do you change your normal recipes (the ones without the Drip Assist) when you use it?",6,1761186267.0,pourover,7,0.88,False

1odrkru,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odrkru,😣😖😣,"Avg dodo experience at this uni goes like: 
You get coffee from time after waiting 30 mins + in the long a$$ line. Then you feel like doing dodo, ok so you go to the dodo spot, but what you see? Literally all stalls are taken. Ok so now 2 options, either go to another dodo spot or wait for it to get empty. Then when you get your turn, not sure why some of the spots even have a door? cause gap below and on sides is like a hallway ( exaggerating but you get the point ). Ok so now you look at the toilet, and 2/10 times or 3/10 when campus is busy you see piss all over seat or dodo not flushed, but this is like a different vent cause its not really unis fault, its the dumb asses who get in uni but morons don’t know how to use a damn toilet. 

Ok so now you close the door, but why the fuck is the area so small, especially in IB and Davis, that when closing the door, the damn toilet has to touch your pants. Motherfuckers give us enough room to close door without hitting the damn toilet. sometimes, in MN or DH, the water be like piss yellow. Wtf if this plumbing man? Like you got the drain to go in toilet fill tank or what? Yuck bro. 
Now, I always always clean the damn toilet before sitting and put bunch on toilet paper on seat cause of hygiene issue, don’t care if it is sparkling clean or i need to do dodo urgently, cause you never know what kinda unhygienic shit be on that seat, and I gotta pray later so gotta keep the thighs clean. 
Motherfuckin sensors now decide to flush as Im sitting on the seat, like fuck are they so sensitive, that they gotta flush everytime i sit, stand or move on the seat, sometimes the water from flush touches your bottom and yuck bro the whole vibes gets shit. 
Different vent but wish they made the elevators this fast rather then dodo toilet sensors, motherfuckers all over uni including Cct, Library, Davis, IB, Dh amd MN go at the speed of a snail, takes like days to go up and down on those elevators. Now you gotta wash hand, but the god damn sink faucet has no water, ok, you go to next sink, the damn water is either is so low on pressure that your unable to wash hands properly or its boiling hot to give you a burn. 


WHAT THE FUCK BRO? LIKE WHAT IN THE ACTUAL FUCK IS THIS? 

At this point charge me 100$ more on the bunch of bullshit you are charging me (for things I never used) and give more god damn toilets bro. Its not a luxury, its a god damn necessity. 

Student union should go to hell imo tbh, like you are gonna fight some bills that restrict funding but not gonna ask uni to do anything about this toilet situation to get more god damn toilets? 

Like seriously, library each damn floor as 1 toilet per floor for men (except ground has 2 but it’s always packed) . 

Imagine getting education at one of the top uni but going through shit Dodo experience. 
No wonder frend pepefart696969 stopped posting, bro got traumatized from the pepe dodo experience.

I am having a 8x26 covered patio added onto the north side of my home which never sees sun even without the covered portion, and with the size of the addition/awning over I believe the moisture it will receive will be almost nonexistant.

I'm mainly interested in a sofa style seat, with a movable ottoman as it's for me and my elderly pup, so a lower height set will work well.  I don't anticipate we will spend a ton of time out there but I do intend on getting some good reading and morning coffee time in on it for sure. 

Would someone have recommendations in a relatively inexpensive price range? I am thinking, considering my criteria, that I could reasonably get by with a sub-$500 set.
